THEY sat in the truck , the hard board floorpounded upwards at them with each successivebump . It made fatiguing riding , but the four children  --  Myron Begay , Jack Tease , Carson Sanders , and Janice Peshlakai  --  did n't mind it much . Late in the day , with the sun crowding hot upon them and the dust swirling , they made themselves as lax as possible and were quiet , watching the country pass by . Myron had forgotten how dried up it was , how desert . Yellow Earth had the pines behind it and perennial streams from the mountains ; it was a fair cattle country of sparse but constant grass . The smaller mountains the truck was skirting now were green way up , they said . This was the dry time of year , till the he-rains began in Ya'ish Jashtsoh . Ya'ish Jashtsoh  --  he counted by moving his fingers slightly  --  July . The Navajo month-name surprised him , he had n't known he knew it . This whole business was surprising , upside down . Washingtonordered them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bulletin board with big words one could hardly make out . They wanted the children to know their families  --  ' tribal life ... cultural heritage . ' Was Washington back-sliding ? And his uncle had written a letter . When Mr. Vail told him , it had sounded grotesquely unreasonable till the wavering cross and ' Shooting Singer , his Mark ' at the foot of the smudged , pencilled page explained the thing . So Na'atoi Hatatli was Shooting Singer . Hatatli  --  singer  --  well , allpIOIright . It meant the prayers and offerings and sand-pictures and all those things . Whoever wrote that letter was plenty ignorant . I 'll write to Mr. Vail by and by , he 'll like it . This is a desert all right . What does a sheep eat ? The tiniest hidden green , unpromising leaves of shrubs , the minutest cover of the earth , the sheep moving and searching in the hot noon while a tired child watches and dozes ... no more of her or that man , one good thing about this . My uncle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . And gone some place we doent know- wehr is she . ' A good thing , changing life , taking a shadow off the thought of his homeland . If he wants to write any more letters , I 'll do them for him , real good  --  real well . Mr. Snyder correcting his English . Mr. Snyder thought this going home was awful , but Mr. Vail was glad . I like Mr. Vail . Mr. Snyder wants to get him fired , but he ca n't do it , is Washington backsliding , new Commissioner , I wo n't see Mr. Snyder for three months with my uncle not that man . Ride down to Tsaili Mr. Butler and get straightenedout . Carson and Janice got out at Ja'abani . Myron watched the meeting with primitive-looking parents , the shy communication , and the changing things in the boy 's and girl 's faces . A man with untidy hair , dressed in faded work-shirt and torn overalls , another wearing a battered , dirty hat , one mother 's threadbare shawl , moccasins . Carson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became unknown , strangeness , the truck jolted onward , steady engine and wheels moving without thought or feeling irresistibly to an unknown life . Jack pointed with his lips . ' Jil Tlijini . ' The tiredness went out of his dust-streaked face and his eyes danced . The prow of Black Mesa 's fifty-mile encircling mass rose along the southwestern quarter of the horizon , moving slowly to its old , rightful place as the sunset rim of the known world . Myron remembered . ' I wonder if they have my horse , ' Jack said . ' If theypIO2did n't round him up this spring , he may have drifted anywhere . Well , I 'll get him , if I have to walk clear to the Mokis . I 'm going to learn to rope from him this summer , like a cowboy . ' Jack always knew what he wanted , he was n't bothered about anything . He made up his mind long ago and he stayed right with it . That medicine bag . Jack was strong . Now he was here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ familiar formations moved to encircle them , unexpectedlyreturning into a life that had been clearly marked off , threatening the simple division of the world into futile Indians and all-powerful whites . Out of the depths of the reservation his uncle and Cottonwood Leader had sent letters , compelling an event within the white man 's precincts at Yellow Earth . If his uncle had n't written , the mission would have sent him to stay with Mr. McCarty , the Navajo missionary , far south of here . The helpless could speak and overrule . Mr. Vail and Mr. Snyder politely snarling at one another ; each had said The new Commissioner , ' but in entirely differenttones . Perhaps the white man did n't know his own mind . You try to understand the whole world and it mixes you up . Jack just knows what he wants . The stone building , with its tin roof , warehouse , corral , nestled under the four cottonwoods against the green-striped , dull red bluff . Scrawny horses dozing at the hitching-rail , two wagons , Indians sitting against the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not embarrassment : imminence of unknownfactors about to enter and change his life , his being . There his uncle and aunt rose and came a few steps towards the truck , then stood waiting . He got out after Jack . His feet moved slowly as he took himself towards them . Jack far outstripped him , he saw his friend and his father and mother examine each other with half smiles , then the hands touching , speech , and flashing happiness . His own relatives waited with pleasant gravity . Indians , they just looked like Indians , like old Ishteen . His aunt 's skirt was wrinkled andp103sun-faded . How much older she 'd grown ! Shooting Singer wore an old , green shirt with the tails hanging free . The jewelry , the hair , the faces , made the real quality of their appearance , but he was n't ready for that yet . His uncle said , ' Nephew , ' and she , ' My child . ' The boy was accustomed , had braced himself , to white adults ' intrusive greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easiness . ' Ten snowsreturning , ' his uncle was saying , the familiar voice , the man in no way changed . His past being as a little boy extended mood and attitude into his present . Ten years . His aunt brought out from under her shawl a paper bag of stick candy , the green-and-white ones he had always preferred . She laughed as she said , ' Have you stopped liking these ? ' her lightness and a shade of almost shyness removing any resentmentin a big boy at recall of a child 's tastes . He was hungry , candy is a rare thing always . It had always been like this and they had not forgotten . Still protected within himself , he took a stick with a brief ' Good . ' They also chose sticks . Sort of  --  well  --  backward , grownups sucking candy . Indian , of course . Shooting Singer said , ' Let us go along , or we 'll be driving in the night . Do you want to buy anything here ? ' ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without condescension . He climbed into the wagon . Ahead lay the hogahn , more long-haired people , strangenesses to meet . He guarded himself before the unknown , but it might be all right . It centred in waking ; consciousness came differently . First there was the fact of being , the emergence from obliviousness before his own identity had collected itself and separated him from the universe . Then custom and identity came together , and drowsy habit was confused by a sense of clarity andp104sweetness , a deep well-being which it was hard to analyze . He would have begun to gather himself for the many persons of the dormitory and the rush to the showers , but now he felt the soft , snug blanket against his cheek with no intervening cotton , and the hardness beneath him . The facts of sheepskins , camp , his cousin 's voice saying something in Navajo and his aunt replying , rushed at him together and his thoughts cohered . He opened his eyes , staring lazily at a bush near his head , hardly visible in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked like behind him . He did n't have to jump up in a hurry , and when he did start , there were only his shoes to put on . His mouth tasted sweet . It was cold still , the air on his face was better than water . He 'd been astonished when everyone moved his bedding outside the first night , he 'd slept badly , and been astonished again at the hour of arising . Now it all made sense , and he was pleased at his own contentment as he lay there , feeling that he had mastered a part of outdoor life . He rose , put on his cold shoes , and ran a brisk circle to get his blood going , then seated himself on the edge of the camp circle . Shooting Singer made his dawn-prayer and scattered pollen . That was all right , that was part of all this newness , he 'd stopped inwardly protesting at the practice of Navajo religion around him , by a process as unconscious as getting used to sitting on the ground . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silver and the fire still counted . There was the promise and almost the vision of ecstasy , an inaudible music which one never gave up hope of hearing , which would all go as soon as it was merely day . Shooting Singer 's low voice and the ritual gestures of his hand belonged with it . At the end , he would smile at Myron . The boy might not believe in the form , but he could share the goodwill . Myron responded , and they sat together , waiting for coffee , companionable . His uncle gave him the directness of man to man , instead of the slanting , man-understanding-boysof white adults.  |p105He  was himself , his own age and bigness as he sat there no longer feeling strange . The distorted memories of long ago had gone from the colour of his perceptions . He did n't notice that desert life was routine and monotonous , time flowed so quietly , with no one bringing Sunday up once a week , Monday with its special routines , followed by Tuesday , making the days click @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If ten identical days passed , it was because he had n't made any effort to make them different . His hair needed cutting , his pants were dirty , he ate enormous quantities of meat and slept blissfully . In small irregularities , casualness , and ample solitude his spirit spread out . An Indian at sixteen is just feeling himself , beginning to have a voice in things , considering marriage , strutting , the age in ancient times of war parties to show that one is a warrior . The young bloods roundabout were backward and ignorant , but they did n't know it . You could n't even begin to make them see what it was to be a first string , triple-threat halfback . His blue-and-orange football jersey was just a handsome shirt to them . But they could ride easily when the saddle had him all one ache , they could stay on horses that pitched him off without half trying . Sheepherding was work for women and children , but a man was expected to know about the animals upon which livelihood depended . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to rememberany trail he had once been over . The country roundaboutwas full of good companions his own age , suspicious of him , friendly , quick to ridicule , able wrestlers , fast runners , strong at rock-throwing , and interested in high-jumping when he showed them about it . They got him on to Yellow Head 's burro and the snaky little beast sent him spinning . He rose from the rock , touching his agonized behind , trying to grin and seeing them laughing and wanting to punch someone 's head . Skinny Boy put a hand on his shoulder . Do n't mind it , my friend . It happens to us all sooner or later . '  |p106The  words and Skinny Boy 's friendly voice answered his lonely anger . He saw  --  what he already knew  --  that the laughter was n't hostile , and he made up his mind again that he could and would catch up with them all . ' My backside is destroyed , ' he said . ' That 's all right , ' Travels Around told him . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Well , let 's do something easy for a little while . ' He taught them mumblety-peg , and saw that they laughed just as hard when the jack-knife cut Travels Around 's finger , and Silversmith 's Son cut his lip . He walked along towards Skinny Boy 's hogahn , idling on the way because he was just a little bit afraid , although he would n't admit it to anyone . The trail went through the hollow between two waves of truly orange sand that seemed in motion . Examining the smooth sides of the dunes , he noticed the fine , neat network of tiny tracks , lizards and birds and insects , over the surface . The tracks were small and perfect ; how could such little beasts do anything so clever ? And where were they ? The place was bare of life , and yet a steady traffic had decorated it . Searching along , he found one bug toiling uphill , the six legs driving the big body in its hard , shiny shell , each leg labouring . There was slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many legs it was hard to remember which one moved next . Its tail  --  or the tips of its wings under the armour , he guessed  --  dragged a little , making two blurred lines always perfectly parallel , with the dots on each side of them , close together , absolutely even . That was a lot of heavy work to leave so delicate a trace . You look stupid , but you must know something , he thought . Harder than Following Warriors making a blanket , and nothing to show for it in the end  --  the wind wipes it out , or I can . He stooped , his hand spread , then decided not to . He picked up a stick and tickled the bug , it fell over on its back , and had a hard time getting on its feet again . HepI07tickled it once more . It raised its shell and flew off heavily under transparent wings . He grinned after it . Yes , you certainlydo know something . Only why not fly to begin with ? He walked on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I guess , so it saves it up . Yeah , like me walking ; I can ride all right , only I save up . Beyond the orange dunes he came out on a whitish flat with scattered , scrubby bushes . The glare of reflected light made him squint ; he looked up and rested his eyes on the hovering mountains to eastward . A jackrabbit crossed his trail in a hurry , then he saw a brown ball of tumbleweed rolling in the faint breeze . It moved , rested , and moved like a living thing . He remembered a story about that , about the war of the eagles against the tumbleweed and the bees . The Navajo ended it by setting the tumbleweed on fire . He wondered if it would really burn , and turned off the trail . Another puff of wind rolled it again ; he sprinted , then threw himself on the tangled plant like falling on a football . Of course it crumpled under him . He set a match to some of it , and it did burn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practise with . Then he could show those boys something . He went through the motions of a drop-kick and looked around to make sure no one was watching . Then he repeated it . Long ago , alkidango , in ancient times the Navajos had a sort of football game , they said . Half soccer and half slugging . You could make up an all-Navajo team . No , long hair would be tough in a scrimmage . You just could n't manage with long hair . But you could make up a team of schoolboys  --  sure  --  all the schools . Wingate had a good team , and half of Yellow Earth 's was Navajo , and that centre at Phoenix , and boys from Albuquerqueand Santa Fe . He began to walk faster , excited , imagining a champion , all-Navajo team . Those Papagos think they 're good , and the Apaches  --  well ... He thought of Haskell and Riverside , the grown men who played colleges , and suddenly he lost his captaincy to those adults . His imagination dodgedp108the obstacle two ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then dropping immediate captaincy but thinking of how even at a hundred and forty pounds a fast-dodging back , a drop-kicker and long , accurate passer , could make his place . The score tied and a deadlock and the lightweight boy who originally got the team organized trots onto the field against Southern California . A drop-kicker . Open formation , and they use the trick Harvard played with Brickley , only he throws a pass . Triple threat . Without getting details clear , he had the ball and was diving into a line plunge beside the goal posts , the white boys rearing up against the line and a hole between guard and tackle , his stiff-arm right into the face of a big , blond college boy , the astonished white man 's eyes and the goal line under foot ... Jim Thorpe saying .. . He realized that he was almost running , and his arm was curved to snuggle the ball . He slowed down , feeling selfconscious . Silly to figure out ideas like that , kid stuff . For those moments he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a letdown . The shelter of brush and canvas came into sight ahead of him . On the nearer side of it , in a flat area of brownish soil , the young corn grew in scattered , juicy , green clumps . Behindit rose a long bluff of heavy , dark red sand streaked here and there with almost white , acid blue-green . Above that the sky was clear and hard . He identified Skinny Boy in the field , wielding a hoe with slow , idling strokes . The sight brought up the imminence of what he had come for , and his mind stopped roving . Skinny Boy leant on the hoe , smiling , waiting for him . ' How much do you hoe in a day ? ' Myron asked . Enough to leave some for tomorrow . ' The long-hair looked around the field . It was in good shape , and weeds were few . ' A little now and a little then , and pray for rain . Did you come to help me ? ' ' My uncle has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school with hard hands , perhaps . '  |p109'Perha|ps  . I want to ride the bay horse again . ' Hallahani ! You never give up . ' ' I 'll stay on him yet . ' Skinny Boy grinned broadly and his eyes danced . ' Come on . ' At the hogahn , Skinny Boy 's mother joked Myron over his persistence , and he answered with bravado , feeling the real approval back of it . His friend went out with rope and bridle , and soon came back leading an ordinary little pony . He picked up his saddle , discarded the saddle blanket that was with it , saying it was too worn , and threw another , a red-and-green one , over the horse . ' Hold its head , ' he told Myron . The animal shied away from the saddle , started to rear when it was cinched , then quieted . They led it away from the hogahn , out onto the flat . Myron felt the excited , scared feeling again . He was making himself go ahead , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Skinny Boy held the horse by nose and ear ; even so it circled and was hard to mount , and started fighting as soon as Myron 's weight bore on the nigh stirrup . Skinny Boy let go , and the bay went off with four stiff , jolting leaps . Myron got the time of them all right , and stayed with it , then the animal changed , a sideways motion which the rider could not analyze , and he knew he was losing his seat . He felt suddenly floppy and afraid , he knew he was going . With the next buck they parted company . Myron thought he flew for yards in the air , and knew lic came down on his shoulder and back with an awful thump . Sitting up , he saw the horse still twisting and bucking , lighting its saddle , and wondered how he could have stayed on at all . Skinny Boy was running with his rope , trying to head it off . Stiffly he rose to help him . When they caught it , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the cinch . The instant that was loosened the horse quieted ; when its back had been cleared of gear , it was just a rather nervous pony , sweating hard.  |p110An  idea struck Myron . He was always given that red-andgreensaddle blanket . He took it up and examined the under side . Two enormous burrs were lodged there . He turned , holding it in front of him . ' Owl ! Coyote ! Chindi ! By golly ! You Words failed him and he stood staring . Skinny Boy was grinning at him . Do n't be angry . ' ' Angry  --  ! This ' he shook the blanket . ' Well , you wanted so badly to learn to sit one , and there is n't any good bucking horse hereabouts . Only just this one , and he wo n't buck unless you give him a reason . ' The utter simplicity with which it was said disarmed him . The joke was on him ; if he was n't careful it would be tied to him . He pushed down his anger . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' ' Oh , not much . It 's only for a little while . Anyhow , it is n't much of a horse . ' Myron wanted to laugh , and at the same time he was still angry . To save his face , there was only one way to take it . ' All right . I 'll stay on him next time . ' His friend laughed , and there was admiration in his delight . The bridle had got entangled with a low clump of greasewood into which it had been let fall . When Skinny Boy stooped to get it loose , Myron saw that he had one foot inside the loop of the lariat . He took two quick steps , caught the end of it , and jerked . Skinny Boy went into the bush with a thump . Then he felt all right , it was out of his system . They walked back to the hogahn , side by side , thinking of lunch.  | HE PROWLED around the fires and behind the wagons , until he came to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and be sheltered in the darkness , and think . Three days ago he rode the bay horse to a standstill , that was a landmark . He had a right to tip his hat forward and walk strutting , with his hands in the front pockets of his overalls , like the other young men down there , to talk and sing with them and pretend not to notice the girls . The big fire was in front of him on the far side of the dancing-space , hard by it the bunch of forty-odd singing men behind the drummer . In front of them and the fire the dancers moved , paired men and girls circling and turning gravely , now clearly lighted , now vague in the darkness . Mounted men , wagons , smaller individual fires , the shapeless medicine hogahn of fresh cedar , formed a surrounding wall . The songs rose up like something visible , high and shining over the gathering . The great emptiness of the desert night was all around ; where Myron stood at a little distance , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the Navajos did not drive it out , but they and their fires and their songs belonged in an endless , wild country and were one with it , having no wish for walls . He had forgotten about the singing . At Yellow Earth he had occasionally heard the heavy , droning Apache music , less exciting than a really good hymn . He swelled with the superiority of his own people . Some of the singers were no older than he , most had never been to school and even a fewpII2. of the youngest wore long hair ; there was no other firststringback from a big school . He wanted to belong . He liked the taste of manhood . Heathen ceremonies . Mr. Snyder would question him , as a boy not yet fit to ordain his life or speak to a girl . Mr. Snyder prying , violating . I 'll ride to Tsaili as soon as this is over . Mr. Butler and his teachings blurred and confused with much thinking over in three years . He might say  --  but backsliding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , only a few of them , distantly remembered , recaptured . This one now  --  yes  --  le-on le on le-on le-on e ya ... He moved his shoulders in rhythm . Mr. Snyder does n't count . A letter from the backwoods overruled him , Washingtonoverruled him . E ne ya yan e yan a . At the edge of the firelight a girl was pulling a young man from his horse . She was small and the man held fast , until another girl came to help her and he dismounted to keep from being dragged down under the animal . Myron saw why white people laughed about it , at the same time the formula , the man letting himselfbe dragged slowly by his blanket , made sense . A man does n't want to seem anxious about girls . Le-on le-on le-on U-on e ya . That was Jack she got . He must have come down from Tlichisenili . Bet he does n't go back to school . The fires made a limited area of light , but the drum reached out and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were joined with a single heartbeat . He moved his shoulders and shifted from foot to foot for warmth , keeping time . This was vacation , it was n't forever . September would settle everythingby ending it . You do n't have to figure it all out . He walked towards the crowd . Jack paid his girl off and went back to his horse . He peered at the man standing by his stirrup , the two of them examined each other with widening smiles before their hands touched . Jack said , ' Hallahani ! ' with real pleasure . ' I hoped you might be here , ' he said , ' only I was n't sure you 'd come . '  |p113'My  uncle was helping in there . ' Myron jerked his head towards the medicine hogahn . ' Come on , let 's get in with the others . ' ' All right . ' The burden of decision had been handed over . They turned together towards the chorus . ' It 's cold , ' Myron said . ' Have you no blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He 'd been ashamed to wear one . ' Take some of mine . ' Myron knew that the two of them wrapped in the one blanket , cylindrically tight about them from mouth to knee , made a perfect Navajo picture as they walked along . They moved into the close-packed group . With the third repetition he knew the song and could let out his voice , hearing himself sing the tribal mode true and clear . They swayed with the rest , arms across each other 's shoulders . Song rose in a shining spiral , out of his mouth he created , participated in creating a substance in which the thread of his own voice ran gleaming . It was a state of being , union , submission , mastery , and outlet , into which one entered , floating upwards , the drum in him and he enfolding the drum , solitary and entirely one with the others . Jack said , ' I 'm hungry , let 's eat , ' and then again , more insistently , ' Eh , grandfather , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him the second time . His mind circled down with a sort of shock . He remembered what jack had just said , considered it . ' All right . Where ? ' ' My people are camped right over there , I can see their fire , it 's still bright . ' ' Let 's go . ' They passed behind the mounted watchers , to where half a dozen widely spaced fires , some still flaming , lit up the ghostly , high-looming covers of the campers ' wagons . Two men and a woman lay asleep around the shadows of the second blaze , heads and shoulders well bundled in theirp114blankets , moccasined feet projecting . A man sat on the ground in the full light , leaning against a saddle on the wagon tongue , and a girl was tending a generous coffee-pot . ' That 's my father , ' Jack said . ' The girl , she lives near us . She comes from the east , the Dine T'ha . ' ' The people my uncle told me about , the ones who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' We 're sort of cousins . ' ' Yes . That 's why her father came over this way . ' Myron was interested . This was the girl who wrote the letter . He had vaguely imagined an older girl , dressed in standard gingham . Only her bobbed hair showed her to be a scholar ; for the rest she was dressed as a Navajo , dull yellow velveteen , blue-and-green skirt , rich colours in the firelight . No jewelry save two silver buttons on the bodice  --  poor people . About twelve years old , he judged . She glanced up , saw a stranger , and ignored them both with perfect breeding . Cottonwood Leader began immediately to make fun of them for leaving the dance , and for the exact timing which brought them just when fresh coffee was on the boil and there was still beef in the pot . They grinned , turning their backs to the fire so that they were warmed but their eyes not blinded , answering over their shoulders . Anyone will grow hungry , Jack said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sang so hard we got empty , ' Myron said . ' When we are fed , we can sing till the day after tomorrow . We really sing , that 's why we have to eat . ' ' You 're a schoolboy , too , ' Cottonwood Leader answered . ' I can tell it . You want a bell to ring , bung , bung , then you go in and eat . I 've seen it at Lokha Desjin . ' ' He goes to Tlinj Tletsoi with me , ' Jack told them . ' His uncle is Shooting Singer . ' The girl looked up . ' I wrote a letter about you , I think , ' she said shyly.  | ' Yes , I saw it . That 's why I 'm here , I think . ' He added in English , ' It was a good letter , but you do n't spell very good . ' ' Give me time . It was hard , you know . He talked Inyan and he said so much , dose hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung the pot off the fire . They ate and drank , beef , tortillas , and coffee . There was only a little meat left , but they dipped their bread in the savoury juices . The man and boys talked rovingly , the girl kept rather in the background . Cottonwood Leader rolled a cigarette and passed over the makings . Jack picked up the sack and the papers . Myron 's heart beat unexpectedly fast . Preachers do n't smoke , this is another form of backsliding . Jack should n't either , he 's a schoolboy . One hated to seem a sissy before that man  --  the girl , what did she think ? Lots of boys smoke on the sly at school  --  not a preacher yet  --  this new business of being a manJack handed over the tobacco . He took it and fumbled . ' Do n't you know how ? ' Jack asked . He mumbled an answer . They all laughed at him , three different timbres of laughter , and he grinned himself . It became a show , ruining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd meant just to roll one and not use it , but now they were all delightedly watching for the next act , so he set out to smoke . That could readily be done from observation  --  many Indians do not inhale . He copied his uncle , cigarette between forefinger and thumb , taking short light puffs briefly held in the mouth . ' He knows this part , ' Buckskin 's Daughter remarked . Jack looked faintly surprised . ' You 'd make a good one-armed man , ' Cottonwood Leader said . ' I knew a man whose right arm was no good . Someonealways had to make his cigarette , but he smoked it all right . ' Myron grinned and puffed . The whole business was nega-pI16tive , pointless ; the tobacco did n't do anything to him , it was neither good nor bad , it was just dull to keep this thing burning . He had a sense of anticlimax , having felt so much about nothing at all . Why did the church keep insisting ? Why did people smoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the stuff clawed at him . He threw the cigarette into the fire even while he was coughing and trying to smile , and they all laughed . ' Whoo ! Coffee . ' A half cup of liquid soothed him . ' Come on . ' He stood up . ' Let 's go back . ' As Jack rose , Cottonwood Leader said , ' Come up to Tlichisenili some time and eat beef . ' ' Good , I will . ' They pulled the blanket around themselves and headed back for the crowd . While Myron had sat eating , the drum and voices had been a background of excitement keeping the sense of a party alive . Now that he walked towards them , they made it necessary to hurry . His concepts of heathens , of ignorant savages , stood on the sidelines of his mind , not relinquished but withheld for now . ' It 's different from school , ' he said . ' It certainly is ! ' ' I mean , things look differently . ' ' Yes . ' Jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite follow . ' I suppose you 're not going back , ' Myron said . ' Yes . ' The answer was definite . ' I 'm going back . My father talked to me about it . ' Shooting Singer had told him about that , but he had n't quite believed . Not Jack . He and Buckskin 's Daughter had changed their minds because of the old Indians , not the white men . Things were becoming complicated by allowancesand exceptions . His uncle 's ideas about school were a kind of inside out of Mr. Butler 's . I must see him soon , as soon as this dance is finished.  |p117They  stepped in among the singers . Song rose in a shining spiral with the bright thread of his own voice running through it . It was part of being young and grown , packed in with the others close about him , creating a state of being which t enveloped the drum , the firelight , the cold sweet night , and j many young men singing together . Old men will surprise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon sun , but his uncle seemed entirely at ease , riding ahead of him on the narrow trail . The three nights of the dance he 'd slept only after midnight , but he 'd dozed and napped through the days and Shooting Singer had been busy with the mysteries . Last night he fell asleep right after supper , and waking twice had heard his uncle still talking with their host . To lonely-living Navajos , half the pleasure of travelling is in the hapchance overnights along the road , contacts and strangers and the exchange of news , but Myron had n't cared . Now he was drowsy again in the late afternoon , and half resentful of the expedition . Old men  --  old Indians , that is  --  can certainly surprise you . They were going high into the Lukachukais to gather some kind of medicine . Heathen stuff . Heathen ceremonies , he then sermons  --  the confused kid , ignorant himself . Guess I was pretty silly . Most kids are . In bed at Tsaili and the drum going , backsliding . Juniper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , falling behind , sand and red rock and clumps of grass , sage and cactus , drifted across his unfocussedeyes . He knew that the country was changing , but he was n't paying attention to that . He had not backslid . He joined the singing , but he never went near the medicine hogahn , and he had kept well in the middle of the chorus when the girls were looking for new partners . Part of the time he 'd just watched the whole thing from the outside . The horses stepped out more briskly as the ground levelled , pI18changing pace where the trail was worn , irregular smoothnessin a rock outcrop . Pinon and pine grew thick , and big junipers made soft masses of deep green . One passed through tantalizing moments of shade , the balsam smell suggested a non-existent coolness . That girl who wrote the letter  --  Buckskin 's Daughter  --  did not take part in the dance . Chance maybe . These Indians thought a twelve-year-old girl was ready for anything . One who did dance  --  hardly twelve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solid men . Heathen . Perhaps Buckskin 's Daughter was Christian ; she ought to be , she was educated . But she put on Navajo clothes for the summer . Most girls do . Not really Christian . The second day of the dance he went to sleep at noon under a bush , then he heard girls ' voices speak and laugh , and woke to see two elderly women , and felt suddenly cheated , angered at the start of his waking . Where he watched from darkness one night , a couple slipped out past him . He remembered them as he rode now , male and female figures , faceless and silent in the dark , walking neither fast nor slow , not touching each other , yet completely not casual , fading into the night behind him with the songs following after . Water and grass brought him out of his doze , the positive , delightful sensations of rest to the eye , the smell of damp , the presentation of coolness and security . Before them the ground rose steeply in a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slope a brook ran in manifold rills twining through a zone of wet earth rich with grass and mosses , to form a rounded area at the bottom , first marshy and stamped with water-filled hoofprints , then sandy earth showing reddish under the haze of short grass . The living water moved in narrow lines and waited in small pools ; a hundred yards from the foot of the slope it had disappeared , and just beyond there the ring of greenness ended . To Myron 's relief his uncle swung from the saddle and dropped his reins . The boy followed suit . When he came top119these little , watered pockets , he always felt that he would like to just stay there , camp and live and never lose sight again of this treasure . He had forgotten at school , with its taps and showers , what water really was . He drank and sprawled , feeling the sturdy blades of grass under his back and by his cheek . Shooting Singer was rolling a cigarette . That had been all right , that time he fooled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morality , Christian morality , a phrase with a ring of importance , aspiration . The girl had laughed at him  --  that was all right She wrote the letter , she should n't wear Indian clothes . Morality  --  Mr. Snyder  --  a sharp discomfort , an unformulated perception of the last days , the cigarette , Buckskin 's Daughter , singing , through Mr. Snyder 's eyes . He felt uncomfortable and drove the memory out of sight . No harm in just thinking about a girl , I 've learnt morality . So has she , she 's been to school a long time . Snyder has nothing to do with it , he 's crazy . His uncle said , ' This is a pretty place , but we must go higher . ' They caught their ponies . Before they mounted , the old man told him : ' Now you 're with me , you have to help me in a holy thing . Until I have gathered the remedies , you must control your thoughts . Nothing that angers you , nothing bad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the last home shaft , and remembering Snyder , he showed his uncle a face of mixed emotions . The medicine man smiled . ' You are becoming a man , and voices of young women pull at your age . When it is hot and one is drowsy  --  why not , indeed ? Women and men are for each other . It will come even harder later , when you really know about it . But there are times and other times . When a man thinks about women , he is pulled aside from what he is doing , disturbed . Do you understand ? Look around you from here on ; watch the trail so that you can return alone . There is beauty on all sides , see it , think about it . '  |p120He  smiled again and Myron half responded , then he swung to his saddle lightly , like a boy . Old Indians will surprise you . Thinking dirty about women is wrong  --  immoral . But they understand a lot . Only you ought n't to think about girls at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The books  --  true love and purity . Galahad . Going for heathen medicine , bear medicine , but I wo n't touch it . An impulse to think all wrong , to oppose his uncle in his head and spoil the magic was shamed down by affection . As the horses zigzagged along the tricky , steep trail , he saw the seriousness of the old man 's face . You could n't make fun of it . Looking to westward he got glimpses of the stupendous valley , more than two days ' journey wide , between them and Black Mesa . The flat-topped mountain rose as they climbed higher , the country between opened up , canyons and mesas and flats , dull red , orange , greenish-grey , washed-out yellow , and the blocks of living shadow . From the top of the shoulder they trotted along a slowly ascending valley , broken here and there by steep scrambles . Aspen and yellow pine closed in about them , the ground was carpeted underfoot , the quality of the air changed ; in daylight under greenness the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The good , damp smells , the freshness , awoke Myron and he felt the increased drive in his horse 's going . Shooting Singer looked back and smiled , a delighted , communicativesmile , as though he had played a joke ending in a pleasant surprise , and the boy responded to it . The old man loved it up here . Why not ? The aspen trunks rose gleaming white and straight , feminine , and the pines were ruddy , their bark full of light . The joy of vegetation above , below , before and behind  --  the tag of his uncle 's morning prayer fitted into his thoughts . With beauty above me I travel , with beauty below me I travel ... Beauty all around me , this day may I travel . He felt just fine . He threw his head back and lifted hispI2Ivoice in the falsetto opening ' ai ya-ai ya ai-yan , ai-yan aiya ... ' a song learnt two nights before . It sounded well among the trees . Shooting Singer stopped him with a raised hand . ' Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ towards war . I 'll teach you a prayer that suits . ' Myron 's pleasure stumbled and stood still . He sat his horse , staring unhappily at his uncle . ' No , ' he said , trying not to sound gruff or rude . ' No . I  --  I 'm a Christian . ' Immediately he wished he could have eaten the words , but they were out , standing between them . Shooting Singer said : ' I know . You must go by what makes you feel right . But you will respect what I am doing . ' Myron had expected his uncle to be angry . His kindness made him feel worse . But I ought not to learn sacred songs , prayers . I ought to feel pleased with myself . Only I do n't . A. moment ago they had smiled at each other , completely together , and now it was interrupted . It was silly of the old man to have taken him along on such an errand . The highland forest continued to work its magic . Irritationslowly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reining his horse to one side of the trail , and pointing downward . Myron saw the big track , almost like a human foot but entirely inhuman . His uncle stopped him as he was about to speak . ' Do n't mention a name . We are visitors in another 's country . ' Pulling out the bag which hung from a string around his neck , he sprinkled a little pollen , the golden dust falling through shafts of sunlight to disappear on the moss while he whispered a brief prayer . Myron felt at once inferior , and cmbarrassed by his uncle 's superstition . The valley up which they rode became narrower , with glimpses of red crags showing occasionally through the trees on either side . The quiet was unlike the desert 's silence.  |p122U|p  here it 's full of them , he thought , unaware that in his thoughts he was following the taboo against the specific , shouting word ' bear . ' There was a story he had heard in the hogahn , about a child one of them carried off the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the medicine men prayed ; on the fifth day they found it in the cave . The child had been well fed on berries , its account of itself was strange , confused , and magical . Five  --  the number used in ceremonies to do with those persons and with war . He 'd mocked the tale in his mind , though it was recent and the men concerned were named . Now his back hairs prickled . The forest was mysterious . He felt excited , and dependent upon his uncle . The trail went over a steep ascent , then down again into a stand of mature aspen , a magnificence of white columns between which they rode for a few yards , coming out into a small , green meadow with a brook in the middle of it . ShootingSinger dismounted near the thread of water , on a slight rise of ground that showed signs of old campfires . ' We stay here , ' he said . ' While I am busy , you can gather wood  --  plenty of it , we 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the pine . Aspen is not much use . ' Hobbled and turned loose , the ponies rolled luxuriantly , then fell upon the rich grass with eager teeth ; Shooting Singer walked slowly up the valley and disappeared . Myron looked around . The trees on the east side were sunlit , but the valley itself was already in shadow and the air was sharpening . This place was as enclosed as many little canyons and pockets that he knew , but its walls were living ; the mind penetrated them fanner than the eye could follow . In there , far or near , could lurk those  --  those persons , magically powerful , wise , dangerous . One could be lonely here , yet it was full of deep peace . He walked towards a clump of scrub-oak at one edge of the big trees , glad to be busy . He got hot tearing branches , scratched his wrists and madep123a small hole in his shirt . When the pile of deadwood , includingsome big limbs of half-rotted pine he had laboriously dragged , was truly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The light had left the treetops . In the clear sky , the west was becoming brighter and less blue , while the east darkened . I is saw the horses , eating and hoisting themselves forward with the curious , awkward movement of their hobbled forefeet , but no sign of his uncle . He looked hard up the valley . Nothing . He busied himself selecting the best wood to start a fire , arranging it , shredding bark . He went to the brook and washed  --  cold , clear water , wonderfully sweet . I is poked at the woodpile , maintaining occupation . Then he saw the medicine man walking easily out from among the trees , as though he were master of all this , a figure of power in a category outside his experience . Shooting Singer smiled as he came up . Well done . It 's getting cool . ' He had a small package of herbs wrapped in a piece of ( lour-sacking , which he stuck in his saddlebags . Then he squatted , arranging the bark and little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something  --  a gun or something  --  for the night up here ? ' Shooting Singer paused , match in hand . ' It is not necessary . I have attended to all that . ' Myron believed him . The match scratched on a small stone , its flame showed yellow-white . From it , a redder Ila me slowly took hold of the bark , worked upward from shred to shred , showing definite colour and warmth in the early dusk , and then became larger , leaping , the familiarity of fire . A camp came into being , a specific place with enclosure . From their saddles , Myron took the bag of tortillas  --  wadded into rather a lump by the day 's pounding  --  and a side of goat 's ribs . Shooting Singer brought out the salt . The meat sizzled and spat beside raked-out coals , sending forth delicious smells . Both of them were earnestly attentive , turning the pieces , respitting them . When the ribs werep124ready , they ate steadily , picking the bones clean and consumingplenty of bread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one lie back and sigh . Shooting Singer piled wood generously to make a blaze . The cold night pressed against their backs , the day had gone while they were absorbed with fire and food . They pulled their blankets around them , and the old man made a cigarette . ' I wish we could go after a deer together , ' he said . ' I like it up in these mountains , and long ago there used to be good hunting here . There 's none now . The deer are gone . ' ' There were deer near Yellow Earth , ' Myron said . ' Jack  --  Teez Nantai Big  --  he and I saw their sign many times , and once we saw some when we went deep in the woods . We never had a chance to go hunt them . We just trapped rabbits and  --  well ' he consciously tasted the quality of their camp , the ancient , fundamental thing . ' We pretended something like this . ' He wanted to confide , to restore the sense of communication he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think , ' he said slowly , like a man describing an object at which he was looking and which he did not clearly see . ' We did n't know about it all , but this is what we were pretending . ' Shooting Singer , lying half in firelight and half in darkness , studied the bright spark of his cigarette . His Pendleton blanket , close-wrapped , made him seem long and narrow , and the pronounced design of it was confusing in the play of light . His face was quite clear , but his long hair melted into the night and the overturned saddle supporting his head was guesswork . ' At that school , you are learning what we all need to know ; you 're not there to hunt deer , even if their tracks come right in front of your door . Learn it . I know a little about the Utes , the Mokis , the Mexicans , the Bellacana right around here , but if you opened me up to see what I thought about the world outside ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ work out cat's-cradles when he did n't know how ? ' Myron felt the equality in voice and manner . It was thrillingand upsetting . In a simple , black-and-white world , the medicine man should be as much the enemy of schooling as schooling was of him . White men were certain ; they cut a line with a knife . Snyder , he had power . So did Shooting Singer , a different kind of power . It went with the leaffiltered , cold night air , the heavy sound of horses moving carried through the ground to his elbow and ear , the wilderncssaround them despite which they lay secure , thinking , using what men have that trees and bears have not . Washington , too , had hesitated , smudged a line into vagueness . Perhaps this was what Mr. Butler had been talking about long ago . He looked at his uncle 's strong face behind the movement of hand and cigarette . Perhaps now something was going to be made clear . Without logical connection , he asked , ' What is my true name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' It is Seeing Warrior . Hold to it . Your strength is there . ' He stared at the fire , and roused himself against reluctance to open too great things , possible disapproval of a loved and respected person . ' What strength , my uncle ? We Navajos are beaten , we are few , I think . These old things  --  well  --  have n't they failed us already ? ' To his surprise , his uncle smiled . ' Why should n't you think like that ? ' he said . ' I have , and often . You , with your schooling , you can help me with the answer , I think . Will you smoke ? ' ' No , I do n't smoke . ' ' It is easier , sometimes , when one is talking or thinking hard . It saves twisting pieces of grass , and causes more pleasure . ' Myron grinned sheepishly , looking at his handful of grass.  |p126Shooting  Singer went on : ' White men count everything . How many Navajos do they say there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' The old man tasted the high number . ' Many people . Pass them by you one by one  --  many people . Eh ! And Indians , all together , how many ? ' ' Three hundred times a thousand and fifty thousand , about that , they say . ' ' Many people . And Mexicans , how many ? ' ' I do n't know . They are counted in with the rest , the Bellacana , I think . ' ' Strange . They are n't the same . But then , after the Bellacanastopped fighting the Mexicans , they came together against us . That 's it , I suppose . Can you reach the wood from where you lie ? ' Myron dragged out a big log and crashed it awkwardly onto the fire , driving up a tower of sparks and all but killing the flame . His uncle rose , mocking . Briefly they concerned themselves with a matter more fundamental than anything of the mind . When the fire was healthy , Myron stood up , rearranging his blanket , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The white men all told then , between the two seas , how many ? ' ' A thousand times a thousand  --  a hundred times all that , and then twenty times it . That is what they say . ' He doubted that his uncle could in any way grasp the number he had stated . He watched the old man 's concentratedface . At length Shooting Singer sighed . ' Did you ever shake water from your hand onto a plate or a board or anything like that ? Each drop stands up by itself , with lots of room around it . That 's how we were , we and the Mokis , the Utes , the Supais , the Apaches , and the rest . The Mexicans , too . They were many , but they were pasturage for us . But you pour a whole barrel of water onto those drops  --  where are they then ? That 's what the Bellacana is. ' pI27Myron felt that he could speak his mind as freely as to another boy . ' Then what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are taken up , lost , in  --  in the barrel . The rest  --  like my name , uncle  --  it 's all swept away , I think . ' ' Before I was born , Red Shirt conquered us . We 've bee a drop in the middle of the barrel ever since , and there ar more of us now than there were then , many more . And e arc still ourselves . One can be like a white man if he choose but can : one be . white man ? Think about it . ' No , but'That 's the point . Think of all the People . We are still a nation , we can still be found in the barrel . We must live with the white men , we must learn their good things , all that we can . We must change , of course . But that which stands up in us is Navajo ; if we destroy it , life is n't worth living . ' Myron thought hard . ' But there are so few Indians . All @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to school . ' ' That does n't matter . It is n't numbers or long hair or living in hogahns . It 's that which stands up in you , the same thing which makes one man by his voice and his eyes control many hundreds to go this way or that . Numbers ca n't destroy that . Life is full of pains and disappointments , yet life is worth living , so long as you have that . ' Myron stared at the fire . What makes life worth living ? His simple set of answers had become inadequate . Nobody had ever talked like this . Why  --  the old man had asked for those numbers , not to learn them , but to make him , Myron , think about them . Seeing Warrior . ' But I 'm a Christian , ' he said thoughtfully . ' How do you know ? ' Myron looked up , startled . ' Of course I know . ' ' You 've never heard anything but the Jesus talk . What you believe , you will have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never heard of , I think . '  | ' Have you heard about Jesus ? ' ' Of course . You know the Dragging Robe at Lukachukai , the one who knows so much about our ceremonies ? We have talked long and long together . I know this  --  our gods do not make war on each other . ' Myron dug at a tuft of grass with one hand . Of course the Catholics  --  he knew what Mr. Snyder thought of them . Snyder  --  just thinking of him he reacted to defence of his uncle . I 've got to see Mr. Butler . ' Let 's not talk about this any more now , my uncle . I think I 'm just a child still . I feel mixed up . ' ' All right . It 's getting late . Build up the fire . ' He had grown used to sleeping on the ground , but it was different here in the meadow , with only one blanket . The old Indians did it , on the warpath and hunting . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , projecting far beyond their wrap . Old men will surprise you . ' Uncle . ' ' Yes . ' ' That story , about a child that was carried off , you know ; did that really happen ? ' ' Yes . It was only last summer , the son of Atsidi Tso over by Tse Dotlish . ' Myron covered his head , snuggling down against the ground . The horses ' stamping , carried direct to his ear , sounded as if it were on top of him , and when he looked up to make sure they were far , he saw the wide , empty night . There are too many truths in this world . Next thing , I 'll go see Mr. Butler . He can help me . He hoped he could sleep , but doubted it . It was beautiful up here . Lighten our darkness , Oh Lord ... the prayer eased him . After much wriggling he got the right adjustment of blanket on the side away from the fire and began to feel warm , drowsy.  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remembered big , solid buildings , and saw that they were small and shabby . The whole place was remorselessly open to the sun , the campus mere desert , the very few , cherished cottonwoods not enough to relieve the eye . Where the cattle-guard barred the entrance to horses , he dismounted , and tied the animal to a clump of greasewood . His uncle had given him a good horse , a baldfacedsorrel with fine legs and a good set of neck , light , wiry , quick . He was sorry there was no grass in sight for it . It passed through his mind that he might take the horse up to that meadow and camp there for a week . That would fatten it . Ile stepped across the cattle-guard , looking about him , feeling changed and grown up , and at the same time recapturingthe little boy deep inside him . Tsaili . One kid , way over there . A white man he did n't know going into the commissary . He wondered if Mr. Linsdale was still around . He 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but of course , the new orders from Washington , only somehow you thought of Tsaili as unchanging . No one around to see his football jersey , blue-and-orange , with the big 22 on its back , or his wide hat . He swaggered slightly as he walked . There was a little girl sitting on the matron 's doorstep . No family , probably . He was halfway to Mr. Butler 's , the fence and tree and the vine over the porch . Unchanged . Now it was all going to be straightened out for him . His heart pounded as he realizedp130how soon he was going to see his friend . Gee , I hope he 's home . It would be awful to have to wait , but Mrs. Butler would give him cookies . Maybe he 'd be angry that Myron had let his uncle tell him the stories , but you ca n't disbelieve something you 've never heard of . Mr. Butler would understand . Now he had reached the gate , opening it as he always had done , and holding in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past a window . Gee , I hope he 's home . Cookies and lemonade . He heard his own feet on the porch , removed his hat , knocked at the door , his smile all but breaking forth . A stranger opened the door . All his excitement reversed itself and became heavy inside him . The man was young , medium-sized , and very blond . ' Come in , ' he said cordially . Come right in . Are you looking for me ? ' Myron stayed on the threshold , staring at his hat . ' I was lookin for Mr. Butler . ' ' Doctor Butler 's not here any more , I 'm afraid . I 'm in his place . Perhaps I can do something for you ? ' ' I just wanted to see him . ' ' Well , come in and sit down anyway . ' This man was young and unsure of himself . ' You were one of his boys ? ' The hand on his elbow was urgent . Myron entered the living-room  --  the same room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more magazines , and the curtains were different . ' Sit down . Is there anything I can do ? ' He remained standing . ' Do you know where Mr. Butler 's gone ? ' ' To Fort Wingate . A more important field , you know , the big school there . ' Yessir . ' Fort Wingate , we beat them twelve to seven . ' How could I go dere ? ' The missionary wanted to do his best . He wondered ifp131boys would come looking for him some day , would miss him the way this boy did Butler . He wanted to make some impression , not be entirely inadequate . ' If you can get to Chinli , you can easily find a truck there going to Gallup . Then at Gallup you could get a ride out to the school . ' Yessir . T'ank you . I guess I better get goin . ' You 're starting for Chinli now ? ' ' No , sir . I got to go see some folks , over on Black Mesa . ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's your name ? ' Myron felt as if the man were running hard after him , yet unable to come any nearer . He did n't see what he could do about it . He remained standing . ' Myron Begay . ' He remembered the other names that this man would never know . The young missionary got hold of his hand and pumped it . ' Glad to know you , Myron . My name 's Mims , George Mims . ' He let go the hand . ' I think I 've heard Doctor Butler speak of you . Are n't you at Yellow Earth ? ' ' Yess . ' It was nice to know that his protector had spoken of him , hut now he wanted to go . ' Home on vacation , eh ? Being a good boy , I hope . ' ' Well , I got to go . I got a long ways to ride yet . ' ' All right . But come in any time . I 'll be glad to see you . I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lemonade . ' ' Yessir . Good-bye . ' ' Good-bye . ' The novice watched the boy go . Would he ever learn how to make them open up ? What a strange people !  |p132Myron  still got tired when he rode many hours , but a brief rest and change of position refreshed him . As he felt the sorrel moving willingly under him again , heading west for Tlichisenili , his spirits rose . Perhaps he could talk about all this with jack . Perhaps  --  Jack 's sort of one-sided . This was the first time he 'd travelled alone , like a man , and now he was entering new country . He did n't know just what was so pleasant about drifting along  --  stopping for the noon meal at one hogahn , for the night at another , meditating on the details of the country as he was carried by on the eminence of his saddle . Rocks and trees and quirks of the landscape were different this way from when one walked or merely sat among them ; partly the lack of effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of new things offered for contemplation ; the world became a show given for the rider 's pleasure . Where he faced a long stretch of good going , he lifted his horse to a lope . He sang Onward , Christian Soldiers , Jerusalem the Golden , and the Wildcat Song . That was a gambling song , and gambling was wicked , but he was tired of trying to figure things out and his mind side-stepped the shadow of a problem . Clouds gathered in the late afternoon , masking the sun . Rain was overdue ; he was worried about a drenching , but glad that it was coming . At school , rain was bad weather , a nuisance , but now he knew it was life itself . That was wrong , the way they taught you . In the first grade  --  ' Rain , rain , go away ... ' Blasphemy to a desert shepherd . Although it was superstition to think that words could affect the weather . He spent the night with a newly married couple who were camped near their sheep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enthusiastic towards life , companionable , and he noticed their awareness of each other . A point came in the evening , a defined moment , when he felt that he was becoming an intruder , so he rolled up at some distance from their firep133where sand shaped itself to a good bed . Too hot for easy sleep , though he was tired . He heard them talking in low tones  --  commonplace words , tomorrow 's pasturage  --  then arranging the bedding , and the man yawned . Then he heard more . It was quiet , very small sounds , but he heard with his nerve ends and all sleep went from him . Not disgusting , they were married . But he felt disgusted . In himself , that was , just as the frank talk of older Indians bothered him sometimes , and the feeling that the dirtiness was in himself , and he remembered Snyder . His uncle said it was natural , a young man thinking  --  but it makes me want , and that 's wrong . He threw off his blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all these complications ; he wanted a simple world . Who will I marry ? Someone who 's been to school . She ought n't to wear Indian clothes when she 's been to school and knows better . He saw a livingroom , rather vague , but there was a lamp , and glass in the window . Progressive , up to date . But the girl would n't focus , only that she had on American clothes , and that kept mixing up with a long , full skirt and an image which was an archetype of a woman reaching over a fire at night and which called up infancy and all the foundations of himself . He slept uneasily , dreaming of girls ' voices at school , and that he had spoken to one  --  an unknown one  --  while they were in line before dinner , insanely . A hurricane of retribution and white faces gathered about him , great wickedness ; Ruth Nalchini who had been sent home pregnant got into it . There was a lot more , and Buckskin 's Daughter who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long and Could n't speak any English and his mother sat by a campfire and he could never get back to the meadow where his uncle waited with the Answer , a small , shining object , in his Medicine bag . Snatches of unfinished dreams in a broken night and then deep sleep from which daylight roused him all too soon . The couple made fun of him for late sleeping , joking aboutp134the white man 's ways he learnt at school . He felt ashamed before their simplicity , and his appetite went entirely when he saw that hers was the face of the girl he spoke to in his dream . Manners carried him through , and he left after half a breakfast . A few hours took him up the first part of the climb to the top of Black Mesa . The return to a stretch of level going was a relief , and the outlook across to the blue heap of mountains , where his uncle and he had camped , eased his spirit . A horseman approached him along a trail coming into his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mesa , a young man , long-haired , riding a showy black-and-white pinto . Even at a distance he could see that the rider wore a belt of hand-wide silver placques , bracelets , and a necklace . Myron reined in where the two trails joined , and the other stirred his mount to a fast trot , coming up in style . He was about Myron 's age , hard to tell exactly , because blanket Indians grow up differently , older , surer , yet gayer and more naive than schoolboys . He might be a year older . He was slender , very goodlooking , and his poor , torn cotton shirt and faded jeans were unexpected under the heavy jewelry . The saddle on the showy horse was poor , too , an old Navajo tree rising to high points at pommel and cantle , the leather covering pieced out with scraps of rawhide . ' Where to ? ' Myron asked . ' Up on top , there . ' The boy pointed with his lips . ' Where from ? ' ' Hasbidwe T'o . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side . ' And you , where to ? ' ' Up there , Tlichisenili . ' ' Where from ? ' ' Ha'anoichi . ' The long-haired boy smiled . ' We both like to travel , I think . ' His smile was thorough and gleeful . Myron answered itp135as he agreed . He felt the direct , anonymous friendliness of the trail , the pleasure of being unknown and unplaced . ' That 's a pretty horse you have . ' ' Yes , I just got him . ' The boy moved his two hands forward in the sign of a horse-race . ' That one of yours looks fast . ' ' He is , pretty fast . ' ' Let 's race . ' ' We 've been going three days now . The horse is too tired , I think . ' ' I 've been coming right along today . There 's plenty of sweat on mine . It 's level here , later on we have to go slow . ' ' All right . Where to ? ' They reined in . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you bet ? ' ' I have no money . ' Myron 's answer came out short . He did n't want to say that he was Christian and would n't bet . He did n't want to seem abnormal . ' One gets it , but it goes so easily . Have you a jack-knife ? ' ' Yes . ' ' Let 's see it . ' Myron pulled it out , the boy examined it . ' It 's good . I 'll put these two bracelets against it . ' Myron was stumped . He wanted to stay in his character of just a Navajo , he was tired of the responsibilities of being Myron Begay , but it was weak to give in like this . Anyone can see why gambling is wrong . ' I ' 11 give you the knife , ' he said , and added boastfully , ' I can get lots of them . ' ' Ei yei ! All right ! ' The boy stuck it in his pocket , his teeth flashing again . ' Well , anyhow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' They lined up . ' Ready ? Go ! ' Better handled , the pinto got off quicker , Myron quirted the sorrel , and as he felt his horse straighten out under him ,  |p136his  blood leapt up , he ceased to have weight . Now the two horses were abreast again . There was a sense of speed such as riding in a car had never given him , his hat fallen far behind and ignored , the wind on his body , his spirit ahead of him lifting him and his horse . The pinto gained . He poured in leather , he could feel his horse putting out everything it had , but the pinto moved clear ahead . The two trees flashed by them and they swerved to right and left , reining in , and then trotted together , loving each other . Myron went back and got his hat . His horse was so frisky it would hardly let him make the pickup , and then wanted to bolt back after the pinto . Panting , flushed with laughing , they took up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their horses , who fought their bits whenever one moved even fractionally in the lead . The level strip narrowed until they were travelling along a wide ledge with the valley and mountains to eastward exposed again , a patterned vastness from which they could not keep their eyes . The boy pointed out where he came from , not very far to the north of Ha'anoichi . So many times I 've gone up in those mountains and looked over this way , ' he said , and this mesa has always been standing up in the west . I decided to come up on top of it , to see what 's up here , and to see how those mountains look to the people who live up here . ' I 've never been over this way either . ' Look , there 's rain . Pretty near where I live . ' ' And some over there too  --  see ? ' They stopped their horses and sat watching . The LukachukaiMountains had become fuzzy where their tops touched a grey , solid sky , the red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , neutral light . Across the enormous expanse of Chinli valley rose black cones , red buttes , and mesas red or buff or yellow or striped , great dominators of their own domains but mere incidents in a low-lying country from where they looked . The flats stretched golden andp137brown and grey , with the varied pattern of faint green as vegetation was negligible or merely sparse . Out of the roofing clouds long , dark , diagonal columns of rain , perfectly symmetrical , reached down and obscured sections of the land . At length the boy said , ' It 's almost too much . ' Myron sighed , ' Yes . ' They roused their horses . As they toiled up the second climb , they smelled wetness , and a cooler air rolled over the edge of the mesa  --  rain coming . At the top , among thickgrowingjack-pines and pinon , it hit them , a stamping , solid , silver downpour . They bucked it for a minute or two , then the long-hair turned his mount aside and swung to earth under the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and they squatted close together , feeling the bark against their wet backs , holding their reins and watching their ponies ' heads turn dark with water . ' Have you tobacco ? ' the boy asked . ' No . ' Myron felt cold and rather miserable . One ought to have a slicker or be able to go indoors . The other began humming the song about one 's lazy cousins . He nodded time faintly . The stranger sang softly , ' Shidzede ' lan do idashilan , ' and Myron joined , very faintly , on the following ' He ye yan-a . ' The stranger smiled suddenly , as he raised his voice , ' Alo , alo , banana . ' They really swung into it together . When they 'd been through the song twice , they looked at each other , each well pleased with the trueness of the other 's high , far-reachingvoice and with his own equal adequacy . Myron started ' Li-n , le-on ... ' and they had that , then the Owl Song for gambling , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , so the other sang it carefully at him , marking time with his hand , then Myron started the Magpie Song , and so they continued . The pinto brought them back to earth , jerking his reins free . Myron said , ' The rain has stopped . ' They rose.  |p138'It  was a good rain , perhaps we 'll see a rainbow . ' The boy from Hasbidwe T'o tugged at his own wrist . ' Here , my friend , take this . ' He held out a bracelet . The schoolboy despised bracelets , but he was so pleased that he could hardly manage a polite ' Good , ' then , recovering himself , picked up the other 's word , ' Good , my friend . ' ' Let 's go . It 's late and I 'm hungry . ' They swung cheerfully into wet saddles . As Myron felt the soaking , cold leather he grunted . The older boy made a wry face . ' When we get off , we 'll look as if it had been raining upside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the well-defined trail towards Tlichisenili 's rocky landmark and singing as the spirit moved them . The demands of thought had vanished . There were the trees with water shining on the clustered needles , the changed colours of wet sand and grass and shrubs , the quality of the air , motion , and the voices in time together . Myron felt affection and gratitude to the traveller he had met , he wanted to stand well with him , simple feelings without any annoyance of reasoning ; his mind was totally in the moment . A gradual rise of rocky ground slowed them to a fox-trot . Beyond the crest , it broke away in a line of cliffs to a long valley about a mile wide with an arroyo down the middle of it . They could see three hogahns , one standing by a large cornfield , and sheep pens . The cliffs of the farther side were grey , an irregular line like a retaining wall holding back the higher level , and here and there the sand had spilled over it in yellowish , wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the summer rains hazed it over , the hogahns were well built , just now the planted cornfield 's rich soil gleamed like dull metal from flood-water not yet soaked in , the thick clumps of corn were sturdy and fresh , each standing well apart from its neighbours . Even in the unlikely corners the plants grew well , and one could see beans and melon vines.  |p139Myron  said : ' This is where I 'm heading , I think . This is what they told me to look for . ' ' You have relatives here ? ' ' Some friends . Do you know Teez Nantai ? ' ' No , but his mutton should be good , I think . ' ' He 'll probably have beef . ' ' What are we waiting for ? ' They went down a sand slope , the horses breaking into a run at the bottom . He went out with Jack to move a bunch of cattle ; hard work and hard riding in broken country thick with small trees . You had to set your teeth and harden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down steep places and through scrub that pounded your face and hands , though by and by you got more used to it and the fun was real . Half-wild animals , long-horned , dun , yellow , reddish , and some of them marked with black , rangy and keen and quick , were hard to herd . They were at it from early morning till close to noon , and when they had the bunch where it ought to he , boys and horses alike were good and tired . The sorrel had stood up well , as quick and fast as Jack 's boasted pony , and Myron was pleased to find himself equal in riding , even if he had not fully mastered the lariat . They started back towards the valley at a walk . Riding ahead , Jack sat sideways in the saddle , one leg cocked around the horn , idly swinging the rope 's end he had used for a quirt . ' That was a queer person for you to be travelling with , that Singing Gambler , ' he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been to school , that 's all . ' ' The two of you made good singing . We liked listening to you . ' He looked mockingly at Myron . ' Gambling songs . I did n't know you had it in you . '  |p140Myron  felt pleased and flustered . They 're pretty , ' he apologized . ' They 're just songs , they do n't say anything special , anything wrong . ' ' Why not sing them ? Of course they 're good . ' Myron could n't leave it alone . ' Of course gambling is wrong . A boy like that ought n't to be always betting . Maybehe 'll get over it . But I do n't think it 's wrong to sing those songs , so long as you remember .. Jack recognized the frowning forehead . ' You think too hard . If he wants to bet , he can worry about that , he and the people who bet with him , I think . You do n't have to agree with him . You know the songs are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think is right  --  do it and stop worrying . ' ' But how do you know ? ' ' I know , that 's all . ' ' M-m  --  well . But how can you tell .. . ' Myron did n't quite know what he wanted to ask . Jack 's decisive face defeated his thoughts . ' You 're always asking yourself hard questions . You 're never happy until you 've found something you ca n't figure out , I think . Why do n't you just let it alone ? ' Myron said , ' No , I do n't want to be mixed up . I just .. He gave up . It made him feel lonely . Jack could n't understand , he did n't need to . Jack just knew . When you tried to talk about these things , pretty soon jack grew impatient ; he felt his friend 's assurance , envying it . Jack grinned affectionately . ' Come on , stir up your red pet there , I 'm getting hungry . ' He swung straight in his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They came out on the rim of the valley just above the hogahn at the east end of the big cornfield . They could see three people seated around the fire in front of it , and the little flock of sheep grazing and idling between the hogahn and the crude fence . ' Buckskin Man , ' Jack said . ' We 're just in time for lunch . ' They welcomed the boys cordially , remembering Myronp141from when they were at the dance together . Myron was vaguely surprised that they were as gay and trivial as anyone else . Knowing their story and how they had affected Jack and himself , he thought of them in connection with high purpose , and somehow expected their wrongs to be visible about them . He expected a fixed , heroic pose . The man 's face and hands showed constant , drudging work  --  that was a big field to farm . They were poor , but well fed ; Singing Beads was scolding Jack for not having brought them a beef , and Jack answered with equal nonsense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . The girl was pretty , Myron realized . In Navajo costume she looked more mature than a schoolgirl . Ethel Harding  --  Buckskin 's Daughter , Abinah Bitsi . She was quiet , sitting between her parents , speaking little but laughing with the others . Jack and Buckskin Man lit cigarettes ; Myron refused , saying that as far as he was concerned smoking was more trouble than it was worth . The girl rose and walked off towards the sheep , the two dogs trotting towards her as she approached . They watched her move the flock up to the afternoon 's grazing . Soon their host said that he had toto work on his water ditch , and Singing Beads moved to her weaving . The boys rode off for home . ' They 're working , all of them , ' Jack said . ' That girl , she 's with those sheep all day . It will be hard for them when the goes back to school before harvest , but she 's going , they say . ' ' Where will she go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nearest . They ought to have schools right around near home , so children can help . It 's lucky I have brothers . ' Jack meditated as he rode , then said , ' When someone marries that girl , he 'll be lucky . ' ' She 's just a little girl , ' Myron answered . ' She 's too young . ' ' Oh , not now . I 'm not like the old people , marrying off children . But when she 's ready . '  |p142Myron  did n't answer . He was thinking about the letters she had written ; in the back of his mind hovered that mixed vision of a house with furniture and a woman by a campfire . With a tone of explanation and some shyness , jack said , You 're related . ' Myron grunted . He understood what his friend was conveying . ' Not really , ' he said . ' It 's my uncle 's wife who 's related to her . ' Jack looked at him , and his face clouded . ' Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I hope she marries someone I like . ' It was worth it for the change in jack 's face , but he felt disturbed , and to cover up began singing . Leaving Tlichisenili , he swung off the trail home , over a ridge and down into another valley . Searching it , he saw the small flock on the far side , and trotted towards it , remainingwatchful until he was sure that Ethel , not her mother , was herding . The two dogs came at him furiously , but when she recognized him she called them back , hurling a stick at one . It surely did n't seem right for a schoolgirl , the dusty , faded , full skirt , the moccasins , the disordered , dusty hair . He knew what sheepherding was like , in memory it had grown to an unbearable drudgery which should never be inflicted on one who could read and write . She stood with her hands idle , looking up at him , shy and curious . ' I wanted to talk to you before I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter you wrote , because of that I wanted to see you . ' ' Why ? ' ' Well  --  it changed things . It seemed queer , in a way , that you wrote it and so I came all this distance . '  | ' Teez Nantai Bige says you did n't want to come . Perhaps you 're sorry , he says . ' ' No , I 'm glad I came . ' He hesitated , then asked in English , ' Are you a Christian ? ' ' I guess so . I du n no . ' ' You ought a be . All of us who want to help the Inyans , we ought a be Christians . ' He said it earnestly , then added , thinking of his uncle , ' We ought a know de odder side too , I guess . But we got ta be modern  --  dat 's Christian . ' ' Jack says you 're bright . Is he bright ? ' ' He 's all right . ' ' But is he bright ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pause , each thinking . ' You 're goin to Keams Canyon ? ' he asked . ' Yess . ' ' You 're about old enough to go to a big school . You ought a transfer to Yellow Earth . ' ' Maybe . Next year maybe . ' ' Yeah . You 'll learn more there . ' She returned to Navajo . ' It 's hard on my parents when I 'm gone . They have the sheep to herd and all . I missed school last year , when we came here , and they needed me . ' ' Yet they want you to go , they say . ' ' Yes . ' She looked right at him and her eyes showed fire . ' After what happened to us , I want to go . Teez Nantai Bige says you learn everything fast . Perhaps you 'll be a leader like Tall Man some day . I want to learn like that . ' Myron flushed with pleasure . This girl had a special power , young as she was . In his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ associated with the decisions the older people had made . ' Perhaps you will , ' he told her . ' Why not ? White women are leaders , and Navajos ' he laughed . ' The men lead bccause the women are pushing them . ' She laughed , too . He 'd meant to say something about the old-fashioned clothes she wore , but now it would sound prim.  | ' I must start for home , I 've a long ride ahead of me . ' ' All right . I 'll see you sometime . ' ' Yes . ' He went off trotting , and feeling relieved . Seeing the girl alone , talking about those things with her , tied up a loose end in his mind . Jack wants to marry her . He frowned . Jack was so likely to backslide , and she was meant for something else . He began to think of all the things he 'd meant to say and forgotten.  | HE HAD tried to go back to the hogahn where he stopped at noon , but the arroyo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steady rain had soaked him until even his hat leaked and his shoes squelched soggily as he pushed along , dragging the lame sorrel . The world was silver grey , he was chilled to the bone , and hereabouts was nothing to get under . With the way rivulets poured over the ground , he could n't be sure if he was on the right trail , or any trail at all . Raising his head again to look forward , he saw a dark clump of trees  --  pia &; probably  --  a partial shelter . He shivered and jerked at the rcins . This was misery . And what a rain ! Why did it have to happen just at this time ? There were four trees in the clump , and now he saw the mud-plastered dome of a solid winter hogahn beyond them . Shelter in any case , perhaps warmth and people and food . The earth roundabout the structure was bare , no signs of inhabitants . Yes  --  hoofprints , already all but washed out , faint half moons full of water . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entrance . He stooped to enter it and called in , immediately aware of warmth and a fire inside , the mere conception of which sent a shudder through him . A girl came to the doorway . ' You ca n't come in , ' she said , ' the men are away . ' She seemed nervous . Even while his heart sank , he could see that she was attractive , noting her long hair neatly pulled back , her deep bodice with its silver buttons . She looked like a person from whom to expect comfort and reception.  |p146'My  horse is lame , ' he said , ' and I 'm wet . ' ' You must n't come in . ' ' When will your men be back ? ' ' Pretty soon . ' She was uneasy , her eyes dodging his for a moment . He knew the code , and knew , too , that he was Myron Begay , a Christian who did n't do wrong things . But how could he make her know that ? Returned schoolboys had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the height of the entrance , rain sluiced down the back of his neck . She stayed just inside , watching him , and behind her was the red glow of warmth and dryness . He straightened suddenly and turned to his saddle , untying the . zz rifle that lay across his bundle behind . He pushed it towards her , stock foremost . ' Here . Do you know what this is for ? Take it , and let me in. , Her eyes danced with amusement , the strained expression left her face as she received the gun . ' Bring in your saddle . ' She withdrew to one side of the fire . He unsaddled quickly and entered , dragging his gear , which he threw down near the door , then he squatted by the handful of coals and stingy flame which fed on a few small sticks thrust in star fashion , and looked at the girl . She was his age . He got the impression of a formed , a notable person , and of something puzzling . She was watching him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked around , his eyes growing used to the half light . There was a double handful of moderate-sized sticks , still damp , near the fire . Her saddle and bridle lay by the door on the north , the women 's side , she had her blanket over her shoulders , an odd-shaped bundle in a flour sack lay beside her . Otherwise the place was entirely bare . Looking up towards the smoke-hole , through which rain fell as an irregular mist , he saw the fire-stick wedged between two logs . He looked straight at her , grinning . ' So the men are away . '  |p147He  saw her hand take firmer hold of the gunstock . ' Do n't be afraid , ' he said gravely . ' I 'm not like that . ' She studied him carefully with wise eyes , satisfying herself , and then relaxed . She glanced down at the rifle and her mouth twitched . ' I was going home , ' she said , ' and the wash was up . So I came in here . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the wood you have ? ' ' Just what I could break off . There 's a dead tree on that side , but the branches are heavy . ' ' Well , I 'm still wet . ' Myron rose . He pointed towards his saddle . ' There 's food in my pack . ' She gave him a look of keen amusement , then took on a meek expression as she reached towards it . Myron blushed to the roots of his hair . He 'd spoken as if  --  well  --  as if they belonged ' I 'll get some wood , ' he said , and dove out . It was n't easy , smashing branches by jumping on them and heaving a rock down on them , and the rain was an actual obstacle , but he felt that he had to bring in more than plenty . It took him two trips to carry all he 'd got , and she exclaimed with pleasure . By then , with the masking rain , daylight had almost disappeared . His blanket had been laid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , an invitation to recline . ' You 're carrying lots of supplies , ' she said , putting his little coffee-pot by the replenished fire . ' I have a long way to go , and thought I might need to cutup out . ' She spitted mutton on sticks , and set a couple of tortillas to warm . ' Where from ? ' ' From Ha'anoichi . ' ' Where to ? ' ' To Nanjoshi . ' ' Eh ! You 're going far . '  |p148'I  thought I could pick up a truck at Tohatchi . ' ' Perhaps . They do n't frighten you to ride in , those cars ? ' ' No . I 'm used to them . ' The coffee boiled and she pulled it off the coals . He wondered how she 'd filled the pot ; some run-off of rainwater . Her movements were skilful , competent , there was smooth economy in the way she reached for things . He was sure she was only just his age , yet she seemed to have gone far beyond . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? People go there to get drunk , they say . ' It irritated him to have such a thing suggested . ' I 'm just passing through there on my way to Shash Bit'o . To the school , you know . ' ' You go to school there ? ' ' No , to Tlinj Tletsoi . There 's someone I want to see there . ' Politeness could not pry further . She examined the mutton and found it ready . She gave him a thick sandwich of broiled meat and tortilla , then turned to the coffee . ' Have you a cup ? ' ' No . ' ' We 'll have to take turns with the pot , as soon as it cools enough . ' He had an impulse to tell her all about why he was going to Fort Wingate , to show her his reality and purpose . The food was all his , he noticed , wondering what was in her lumpy bundle . The rain had stopped , and one could faintly hear the rumble of flooded arroyos . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' I hope so . Was it flooding the way you came ? ' ' Yes . I tried to go back , and I could n't . ' ' Just as I did . So we met here , in the halfway place . ' Now that he was warm and partly dry , and the food had made his middle snug , he had to be aware that she was a woman alone with him by the one fire . He remembered Ethel and was ashamed of himself . He was too inexperienced top149note her breasts , to visualize a body , but he saw the charm and character of her oval face , and her supple slenderness . There was the puzzlement again of the blanket Indian not seeming inferior , and the foolish , proud voice saying I 'm a man , I do what a man does , and a deep wish to be respected , not to offend . ' That 's an odd bundle you have , ' he said . ' Did you bring any food ? ' ' No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's . ' She unknotted the end of the sack . ' He sent him these . ' She dumped out a lard pail converted into a drum by tying a piece of inner tube over the mouth , a small drumstick , and a silver belt which she held up . ' Last night we were playing , ' she said . ' A boy came by , a great singer and gambler , and in the end he lost everything cxcept his horse . He wanted to bet that , but my uncle would n't let him . So I was taking the belt home in payment for a horse my uncle bought , and he threw in the drum for a joke . ' ' A black-and-white pinto with a black head ? ' ' Yes , that 's the one . ' ' Singing Gambler . ' ' You know him ? ' ' Yes . He and I were together a month or so ago . ' ' Playing ? ' ' No . I do n't do it . It 's just a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You can have a good time withoutlaying money on a blanket . ' She started to answer him and checked herself , one hand raised and her lips slightly parted . There was a sound nearer than the rushing arroyos , but like them and growing louder . ' A cloudburst , I think , ' she said . ' Yes . ' It was coming fast , and its quality was frightening . They looked at each other . She laughed . ' We may get wet . '  |p150Myron  smiled in answer . Pending discomfort seemed somehow diverting . The downpour marched roaring . Advance drops , then hard rain struck the hogahn , then a river flowed downwards from the sky . They snatched the fire from under the smoke-hole , hissing logs already wet , filling the place with smoke . The zone of ashes became a grey puddle , water spreading out from it met more coming in the doorway , until more than half the floor was turned to mud and only the western quarter , the host 's place behind the fire circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the logs above them seemed to press directly on their shoulders , they were surrounded by night and grey coldness and hostile rain as they crouched together near the back wall . Myron worked with chips and bits of bark , using his hat as a fan , till flame leaping up caught the smoking logs and light spread out again . They sat with their blankets round them , knees drawn up , united in wondering if their space of safety would fail . The river ebbed , became shafts , then drops , then began to die away . Myron rose and went to the door , standing in water and mud as he looked out . Little enough to be seen in the blackness ; a tree vaguely outlinedindicated an undestroyed world . He wondered just how long it had been . The girl smiled as he returned . Is it still there ? ' ' It seems to be , as far as one can tell . ' He set to rearranging the fire , moving it as near as possible to its proper place , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you think ? ' she said , and he caught the nervousness in her voice , ' this place  --  is it  --  has anyone  --  this storm coming right on us , you know . ' He looked around . He knew very little about what they did when a hogahn was abandoned after someone died , but the right answer was obvious . ' No . ' He felt protective . ' There 's no hole in the north wall , and that fire-stick , that means they plan to come back , I think . ' He spoke firmly , as though he knew all about it.  |p151She  looked at him over the blanket she had pulled half across her face . ' You 're going to school , you know writing and all those things . ' He waited . ' I wanted to go . I wanted to learn , but my uncle Returning Wisely would n't let me . His first wife had been to school , and they had a bad time . ' ' I know . ' Myron had heard of Returning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ master of the Mountain ( Thant . ' I think he 's changed his mind since , but it was too late . I was married . ' ' You were married ? ' ' Three years ago , but not now . ' She made a diving gesture with her hand . ' He was not young , even then . ' The little girls paired off with old men , the thing that made one feel all wrong . The picture of Ethel rose in his mind , but even more he felt and thought of this one , the sense if her maturity and also the even comradeship between them now , equal youngness violated by entrenched old men . ' Why did you want to go to school ? ' ' Everyone talks about the white men , perhaps if one understoodthem one could do something . That way I thought about it . But you boys who have been to school , you do n't want to do anything . It 's the women who hold everything together . Perhaps a woman can do it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The occasional spattering remindersof rain made their narrow space of dryness seem snug . They had been through something together , they were in a special world of their own . He was warm , comfortable . Pinon wood gives off a smoke which is a perfume , delightful To o the nostrils , not stinging to the eyes . Between their fire and the wall the girl and he sat , meeting each other . This warm and living girl . ' You get mixed up and it 's easiest to run away from it ,  |p151I  think . ' He heard his own voice and saw her listening . ' Lots of people just forget about what they learned , they just sit down . ' He began really talking , easing himself to her , the two things that would not come together and which , separated , left the world broken in half , the certainties that faded , the snags and resistances , Snyder , his uncle who wanted him to stay now that it was autumn and time to talk of the gods  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Butler to whom he was going for advice . Just the act of talking and being so well attended brought many things into order . ' So I do n't know , ' he said , ' but I 'm a Navajo . Too many things are true , but they must fit some way . I want to get it all straight . My uncle gave me the answer to some things , but it has to be straight . ' As he talked , he had roused himself to a full sitting position , looking at her from time to time and always finding the dark eyes with him ; he had talked to her and to himself , feeling inadequate and having no idea how completely , between word and voice and gesture and the changes of his face , he told it . When he finished he felt at once relieved and rather nervous . What he had said  --  how odd would it seem to this girl ? In the narrow dry space between the wall and the fire , her arm touched his from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shifted his position . She was intensely present . The wall at their shoulder blades continued unbroken into the curve of the low roof to the central smoke-hole , enclosing them in an arch of firelight . Sensations , perceptions , came to him heightened , and the long climb to the mountain shoulder where the storm had caught him , the nightmare walk in the rain , took away the sense of a specific place attached to other places . ' I never knew a Christian before , ' she said . ' At least , notmore than to know who he was . Are they usually like you ? ' ' I do n't know . Most of the children go to church andp153sing the songs , but they are n't Christian . As soon as they come home they forget all that , along with the rest . They just put their heads under a blanket . ' He did n't think of her as being the same age as girls who sat in the classroom with him . The effect of maturity that came from her marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave her a special character . She was impressed by him , she had caught fire . ' I 'm trying to be something , ' he said , words of his uncle 's and of Mr. Butler 's rising in his mind . ' I 'm going to school . I 'm learning all those things . In the end I 'm going to do something for the Navajos . ' She saw his intense face . ' You will . The old men I have known '  --  she hesitated almost imperceptibly , and he thought of that husband , and the parents who gave her to him  --  ' the old people , they wo n't do for us . And the young ones , they go around like Singing Gambler , or they put their heads under a blanket , the way you say . But you will do something . I know it . Only you 've got to understand the Navajo part , too . Now that you 're here , you ought to stay t he way your uncle wants , I think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bit'o . ' She laid her hand on his arm . ' You 're trying to get your uncle and that man  --  that Hasteen Bucla  --  to make up your mind for you , I think . You have to do it for your-self . ' He felt her hand , its live weight and the shape of her fingers , it went up through his arm and into him . When he turned slightly to answer her better , he faced the eyes , long and deep , and the sensitive , firm lips . She had warmth surroundingher like a visible quality , and his thoughts stopped , drowned out in the vivid sense of the person . Her lids half lowered over her eyes , and he heard her breath hesitate . Then she looked frightened . The swift leap of physical sensationshamed him . Immorality . He thought , if she knew she 'd despise me . He drew back.  |p154'I  think I 'm going to stay , ' he said , his voice coming out uncertain , jerky . He remembered Ethel . Not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbance in himself continued . The union between them was broken and he ached for it . A multitude of thoughts and sensations swirled in his mind , the broad talk of young Indians , moral principles , one is a man and does what a man does , and woman can despise one for holding back , they say . Something had been pent up for a long time . This girl 's contempt would be unendurable . He reached out and took hold of her shoulder . ' No , ' she said . ' Oh no . ' There was none of the mere flame of desire he had known so often in his thoughts and in dreams . Too many ideas and conflicts confused it within him , driving him against himself . Strength . Prove yourself . He said , ' In this place ' his voice was harsh and broke , he could n't finish and was unsure of the thought , but he pulled her towards him . He felt clumsy , young , uncertain , and that he must be none of those things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes wide open , searching him . From his hand on her shoulder he could feel the tautness of her entire body . He was thinking that he had destroyed everything now . Himself saying do n't be afraid , I 'm not like that . He let go of her . ' I 'm sorry . ' It sounded miserable and inadequate . He rose , put more wood on the fire , then came back and sat , not reclining but well up , his arms around his knees . ' I 'm sorry . ' He did n't know how to say what he was thinking . In her were delights at which instinct guessed and imagination quailed . He looked to see her angry face , and saw her calm . ' It 's all right , ' she said . ' It 's natural to men , I think . Only for a woman , it 's not just so simple . ' He did n't want her to think of him like that . ' I  --  I never  --  up to now , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You never ? ' ' No . Only , you see , since we talked together ' The need to explain himself was lost in the need to tell her what with astonishment he saw that he felt about her , there was something big and she had to know it . ' You do n't seem likegirls , schoolgirls --  ' This was a strange land in which hewas trying to find his way . His words came out hard as he stared at her , trying to grasp what he saw so that he could tell about it . He started again . ' You said I was n't like the young men you knew . Well , you too . I feel with you  --  something else . ' He stopped . She said softly , ' Oh , so . Not just girls ? ' ' No ! ' She raised herself on her left elbow , studying him again . He saw a change that he could not name , his arm went around her and she came to him . Not taut now , not rigid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slid down beside her . Clumsy , ignorant , with the flame blazing , wanting to go on in a harmony of motion , the confusion of clothes , fumbling , and self-conscious . But she knew . She moved and somehow led him , her touch was quaking ecstasy . Now far beyond what dream or instinct had ever prepared him for , now into the reaches of infinity , and this woman moved against him divinely terrible , and his capacity was divine . Sensation swept them swirling , it was she , she blinded him and he was master of her . What have I done what have I done dirtiness lain with a woman sin what have I done her arms around him and her trusting body close against his rumpled clothes and grotesque attitude sin what have I done . Responsible , I did it to her have to marry perhaps did it wrong wrong , the things said , the trap of his own urging words to be lived up to . He resistedhis desperate longing to push her away . A man . Disgust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But he had to move , to be separate . He made himself pull away gently , and saw her half smile and eyes that were contentp156upon him , still seeing her beautiful and wanting none of her . He did n't look at her as he straightened his clothes and went to tend the fire . I 've got to be decent , got to be decent . Loves me . A weight upon him . Loves me . Done enough wrong . Tales of cruel seducers , claptrap of white folklore moved in his mind . Show myself a man . Loves me . And she is fine , a fine person . He heard her move behind him . The lard pail drum reflected the fire ; the sight of it suggested occupation , a bridge towards control . He picked up the drum and stick , then turned back to her . She was sitting up , orderly save that her hair was loosened , pulling her blanket over her shoulders . He was astonished how normal she looked , and he managed to return her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on to himself , and when she moved close to him was unable to keep from flinching away . She gave him a sharp , startled glance and there was a flash of pain in her eyes . He felt unutterably cheap , and knew that if she touched him he would flinch again . He stared at the fire . ' I 'll make some coffee , ' she said , rising . She was gone for some time , getting water . In the blessing of being alone , the first force of reaction ebbed . Now there was no question of going to Mr. Butler . Maybe he could n't even be a Christian any longer . Just a Navajo like any other Navajo . Was she bad , was she loose ? What is a bad woman like ? He did n't think she was . Just ignorant , and perhaps she loved him . The sooner he could get out of here the better , but meantime he had to behave well . His fingers tapped a rhythm on the drum , a hymn came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lamb of Calvary  --  blasphemous now . She came back in and busied herself at the fire , the type of her picture agelessly familiar . When she came over to sit by him , she put her hand to her loosened hair and smiled ruefully . She 's not bad . What is she going to expect from me ? She arranged herself in her blanket , lying with shoulders and head against the bank of earth at the wall.  |p157'I  do n't even know your name , ' she said . ' We are where we are , and I do n't know what to call you in my mind . ' ' Big Salt 's Son , I am called . ' He hesitated , and knew he wanted to tell her . ' Seeing Warrior , that is I. ' Her expression became a little less guarded . Her eyes and lashes were shadowed as she lay , her face in shadow with the dark hair around it like smoke , and her half-smiling mouth between the straight nose and the round definite chin . She repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' War Encircling . I 'm called Juniper . ' War Encircling . It suited . He thought vaguely , sinking into a tired silence within his mind , his fingers tapping idly on the drum . Juniper . ' Are you going to sing ? ' He roused himself . Sleep and solitude existed in the real world , not in this one . One must do well , and talk was dead . An Anaji song came to his mind , but the gay lift was impossible . He took up the chants his uncle taught him as they came down from the mountain , sober , strong prayers ; at the beginning his voice fell down , then he started again and got going . It was a sequence of four , and singing them relieved him , their meditative quality and the rhythm which could be marked on the drum , although drumming did not rightly belong with them . He came into greater possession of himself , less trespassed upon by her near presence , and with this , desire to show himself well began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourth chant . ' You can sing , ' she said . The Lazy Cousins song went back into childhood , he started it almost unconsciously , letting the drumstick go full force . Its own lift and tempo caught him up , he was drawn upwards in its rise . Anaji songs , young men 's songs . A man is a man . He communed with himself , was alone within the house of song , and his blood began to circulate again . He followed it with another and then two for gambling ,  |p158restoring  his shattered sphere . One does what a man does . The coffee came to a boil . She rose swiftly in one long line to step to the fire and tend it . As he looked at her , his many thoughts and feelings were coloured by a sense of triumph in regard to her . ' Truly , you have a voice , ' she told him . She set the pot handy on the ground . ' Sing some more . ' That effort was over , he could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . I could n't keep on lifting it up . ' They fell silent , both watching the coffee-pot , impatient for it to cool enough to give them an occupation . They made no attempt at small talk . She tried the lip with her fingers . ' It 's ready , I think , ' she put sugar in and stirred with a stick . ' Here . ' She handed it to him . It broke a tension , the metal container passing from her enclosing fingers to his , the still scalding , sweetened drink . He lay upon one elbow , sipping , then passed it to her . He knew her , there was intimacy . He did n't want to think at all , his tired mind let go its conflicts , everything in him slackened . He laid it all aside for tomorrow . He became aware that something had ceased , there was an increased stillness in the night . He puzzled over it for a moment . ' The arroyos have gone down . ' She listened . ' Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much . First we have none , then too much , then none again . ' ' Do you suppose one could make a lake ? At school we studied about dams . ' They talked driftingly . The coffee could not arouse them , presently they began to nod , caught each other at it , and laughed . He looked out the door , then heaped up the fire . ' It 's midnight at least , and clearing . It 'll be cold towards dawn . ' They rolled themselves up side by side . In the last drowsi/ness before sleep he desired her , without questioning . It was a new shape of desire which knew itself and stated what it knew . He was far too near sleep to move , the wish rose and faded , blurred away as the ground under him softened and sensation dissolved . He came awake slowly , conscious first of the sound of a match striking and the smell of smoke , then noticing that there were no sheepskins under him and remembering . He wanted to postpone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself somehow , and sat up . It was full day outside . The surrounding foothills still shadowed the hogahn , but through the smoke-hole he could see a fresh , brilliant sky . The storm-mood of isolation was ended , the world pressed upon his mind . Guilt . The girl by the fire smiled at him with a friendliness that made his heart sink . ' I 'll go catch the horses , ' he said , putting on his shoes . ' What does yours look like ? ' ' A grey , rather small , with a white mane . ' He went out with rope and bridle . Now he had to test what he 'd learned these past months about horses and tracking . It was important not to turn out incompetent . His shoes had dried stiff . The morning was sharp , tingling , cold ; the sunlight on a bit of the main mountain showing over the hills to the south looked delightfully golden . The world was fresh and washed and the colours all clear . He was pleased with himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of all . He succeeded in getting his rope over his own horse , bridling him , and then roping the grey when he tracked it down , so that he rode to the hogahn in fine spirits , until , as he came near , everything it signified rushed at him again . He 'd have to eat breakfast , in fact he was hungry , but the sooner that was over the better . She did n't speak to him when he came in . They were both constrained , and sharing the coffee-pot was awkward . She looked younger , more of a girl and less the completed woman , and had lost the liveness he 'd felt so when first she 'd blockedp16othe doorway . He decided that she , too , felt badly about it after all . There was something he ought to do or say , but he did n't know what . Offer to marry her ? He shrank from the thought . They were brief with their eating . When he went towards his saddle , she said , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun . He stared at it a moment , then laid it on his bundle . ' I 'm sorry , ' he said . It did n't sound adequate or entirely fitting , but it was all he could think of . She was n't looking at him . ' I may have a baby , you know . ' There it was . It seemed that he 'd been getting ready for it for a long time . ' Then I 'll marry you . ' ' No . ' Surprisingly clear and definite . ' I do n't want to marry you . You 're hardly ready . ' He felt annoyed . Marrying her was the last thing in the world he wanted to do , but he did n't expect to be scorned . For a time last night he 'd had her admiration , now she brushed him aside . ' All right . But I 'd be glad to . We  --  after all --  The words would n't come . ' Do n't worry about it . ' Her voice was slightly sharp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed . He could n't let her go on just that note . ' You 're going home ? Where do you live ? ' ' Up there , where you see those red cliffs  --  a little above that , on the edge of the timber . You 're going on to Shash Bit'o ? ' That was over with . He could n't go to Mr. Butler now , but neither could he tell her that . ' I do n't know . I 'll think about it while I ride today . ' She looked at him curiously , then glanced at the sorrel . ' Is your horse still lame ? ' ' It 's only stiffness , I think . I 'll lead him till he warms up . He 'll be all right when the sun gets on him . '  |p161She  mounted . ' I hope you have a good trip . ' ' I may not go far . Perhaps I 'll see you this autumn . ' ' Perhaps . ' Her tone was distant . ' I 've got to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lope , while he stared after . But I said I 'd marry her . Why , then  --  ? juniper . He started along the back trail , leading the limping pony . Vividly the good things came back to him , confidence , intimacy , passion . All lost now . Guilt . Sin . Blanket Indians are too ignorant to know how dreadful it is to have a baby like that ; a girl just has to get married . But she would n't marry him . Not really a man . You 're hardly ready . Impossiblenow to go to Mr. Butler , or back to Yellow Earth . He bclieved that what he had done was stamped on him for anybody to read , he even feared his uncle 's gaze . Many unlike fcclings at the same time contended within him , and those long , shadowed eyes and the fine mouth ... War Encircling.  |p162EANANIYE  , Now a holy one paints himself , Kola nina , Now Wind Boy , holy one , paints himself .. . With dark cloud he paints himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonorous chanting of the men behind him filled the hogahn . He stood up , in breech-clout and moccasins , facing the figures of Talking God and Female God , the two featureless , symbolic masks . Talking God changed the yucca whips in his hands . The boy 's hesitation over being initiated , his fear of finding it only grotesque and barbarous , had centred in advance around this rite of being whipped by some man in a mask . He stiffened . The yucca touched him firmly , but not as a blow . There was no pain , no reality of whipping . He felt foolish , and suddenly it seemed as if the god knew and had known , the white mask with the cornstalk painted on it assumed expression ; it was only something over a man 's head , an ordinary man with the white buckskin hanging from his shoulder , but Talking God was there with his true face hidden and sunbeams around his head , Hasche Yahlti , the Grandfather . Now Myron was afraid his wrong thinking would be seen and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on four times . Female God began to put the sacred corn meal on him . With rain bubbles he paints himself , Kola nina .. .  |p163He  heard the song , and turned sunwise for his back to be sanctified with corn . It was done . He sat down and covered his head again with his blanket while the next boy rose in turn and the song continued . To the plume on his head he paints himself , Kola nina . ananiye . Now a holy one paints himself , Kola nina . Under the blanket he crossed his arms on his knees and rested his head on them ; the chanting came to him through the ground and his skin as well as through his ears , and he heard Talking God 's call . For two months it had flowed in a steady stream towards this : for two months the full activities of daylight life , the interruptions and normalities , had become thin , secondary , peripheral things strung on the one , continuing reality of Shooting Singer 's face in the firelight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliantly the scenes and divine characters of the great legends . He had asked for it perversely , as if he wanted to wrong himself ; he had n't known the stories were like that , as strong as the Bible and with a quality that struck more directly into the depths'of his being than anything he had ever heard before . Not preaching or doctrine , but stories which made all one story , and the people came up out of an older earth , and the gods lived and moved ; the vivid images glowed in his mind , the words recurred during the active days intervening between night and night . They made the moon of crystal , bordered with white shells , and covered its face with a sheet of lightningand all kinds of water . They made Cholihi Mountain fast to earth with a cord of rain , and decorated it with pollen , dark mist , and she-rain . They put a yellow bird on its peak , and sent the Boy and Girl who Produce Jewels to live in it . The Divine Twins @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of Sun Bearer , they became men and Slayer of Enemy Gods stood forth , mature and ever young . Within the great cycle of tale on tale he lived . Narrative forced no argument , once interest was captured and the characters came to life . Parts of the Bible made him tingle , and King Arthur was read to pieces at Yellow Earth , but voice , emphasis , pause , and gesture transcended the written word , and the characters were all Indians . It was a single stream , flowing up to this moment . They uncovered their heads again , and the two men stood before them , masks in hand . The other neophytes were much younger than Seeing Warrior , but none of them young enough to be surprised when the gods were revealed as friendly neighbours , and yet it was a great moment . Now , carefully , the masks were put upon them . He looked out through the eyes of Talking God ; it was rather smelly , and while the contraptionwas over his head divinity was present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , He rises towards you .. . The masks stood on the buffalo robe , and the first neophyte rose to give them pollen . The positive act of worship  --  Christianity tugged at Myron , but holding back was impossiblenow . He watched the youngster with the utterly intent , awestruck face . Now to your houseHe approaches for you . Now he arrives for you . Now at the door , He enters to you ... It was his turn ; he had to walk carefully in the crowded hogahn , around with the sun . This was the act which would cut him off entirely , and he would belong to the Navajo gods . The name of Slayer of Enemy Gods flashed in his mind , thep165meaning of ' Enemy Gods . ' He must be careful how he thought at this moment . The white and the blue objects standing on the buffalo skin were powerful , he was afraid of what they might know . He did n't frame any prayer as he put the pollen on , with the man who had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intense communication with the symbols . He comes withinHe takes his offering . ' Your body is strong , ' Your body is holy . ' Now , I say . ' He took his place again , listening . Stripped as he was , with the air moving against his skin , the last words of the tong were full of meaning . Your body is holy . They started the next chant . His uncle was conducting this , right now he knew the old man was happy . That caused him an extra gladness . With the others , he breathed the smoke of sacred herbs , heard the rest of the sequence of hymns , and went out . He really knew he was a Navajo . He had seen something great . That was only the fifth day of the ceremony . People were corning in , but the main gathering would not be until the final , ninth night . It was n't like a church service at all , it had nothing in common with Sunday . It went on and on from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and other parts stopped his breath with excitement . It built up with remorseless completeness , like the myths which each act and prayer and sand-painting evoked , its force grew and a whole existed . The sixth night , the seventh night , the eighth night , the ninth day . The trail of beauty . These men thinking and living one thing , the single effort and emotion covering the hogahn and the surrounding camps . The spirit of the ceremony travelled with him when he went out to look after his uncle 's team and his sorrel on thep166ninth afternoon . Even with the sun still high , it was cold , so that he walked briskly , whistling songs from the chant . The animals had drifted far . Tracking them , catching the sorrel , and bringing them all to a nearer ' grazing place , his mind ran free and idly over thoughts and perceptions most of which left behind only the pleasant sense of having been occupied . The higher parts of the mountains were white with snow , he wondered when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to walk in arts of the ceremony kept coming to mind , the gods , incidents and scenes of the myths , and with them a sense of devotion , a will to be consecrated . Before he left Tsaili , under Mr. Butler 's teaching religion had begun to change from a formula of power into an emotion , but he 'd lost that at Yellow Earth . The services of his sect were bare . Things that were coming to life in him responded to parts of the Bible , to some hymns , and to the mystery of the Round Table that all the boys liked so much . Mr. Snyder disparaged the Holy Grail , calling it popish and superstitious , but even he approved of an admiration for Sir Galahad . These were scraps , parts , of what came forth whole to meet the  --  riches of the Navajo religion . A boy could follow Galahad with hero-worship , but the Twins were like himself , Indian faces of young determination facing danger after danger , becoming men , Slayer of Enemy Gods and Child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ useful . The Younger Brother 's loyal support of Nayeinezgani , the great deeds against the monsters , freeing the world . Slayer of Enemy Gods shone in his mind , a warrior , a hero , and an Indian . He hummed a Nayeinezgani song as he walked towards the encampment . Many people would be arriving now , soon the last night would begin . He steps from mountain summit to mountain summit , and in the valleys between , the pines are slashed with white where his lightning has struck . Myron looked up to the mountains , half expecting He thought how odd it was ; Jack had gone back to school , and he wasp167here . School seemed unreal , the thousand thousand white men were far from the sufficiency of the Navajo country . Save for two trips to the trading post , he had n't even seen a Bellacana in four months . He missed jack , he ought to be initiated , too . Jack and Ethel bothered him , they might think he 'd quit on them . But the answer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  he told himself that , but the thought pushed itself over the horizon of time , a saving grace comfortably remote . He wished they were here . The top of the rise was marked by a flat , broken ledge of ruck in corners of which cedars grew . From it one looked down a gentle slope , a quarter of a mile to the hogahns . Myron was surprised . Knowing that this was the last night , seeing people begin to arrive this morning , had not prepared him for the gathering that changed the character of the encampment . The white , prairie-schooner covers of the outspannedwagons spread in wide , irregular lines north and south of the medicine lodge , smoke of many small fires drifted in the moving air , in places forming a bluish haze close to the ground , mingled with the yellow haze of dust from hobbled horses lurching out to graze and riders coming in or visiting about . Along the two main trails more wagons moved , not many , a couple in sight , a few indicated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the horizon before i t dipped below the level of nearer ground . Here and there rode men and women on horseback . The noise of heavy wheels and chains rumbled to where he stood , and a man 's voice shouting at his team . He 'd forgotten how long he 'd been seeing people in twos and threes . He stepped forward , an initiated man who belonged , and remembered that Juniper might be there . Her uncle , Returning Wisely , was expected , so her parents and herself were likely . Myron wanted to see her , wanted her to know that he was more of a man than he had shown himself to be . As he drew nearer the gathering , his eyes drifted over the groups.  |p168He  wondered what her parents were like , having a slight feeling of hostility towards them because of that early marriage , though he knew it was just ignorance . Shooting Singer thought his daughter ready for marriage . This becoming a man was n't simple . You thought you knew yourself , knew all about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when you 'd gone into that , the old was changed , too . I 've been an awful kid , he thought . It had happened again with the initiation : he believed he understood the religion , and then right at the part he thought would be a letdown , where he feared that ridiculousness would break through the will to faith , it happened , when Hasche Yahlti 's whip was not intended to hurt  --  from there on . Without explanation he knew now how the ordinaryman with the snowy white buckskin hanging from his shoulder , his head masked by the crude buckskin symbol with its feathers and paint , could contain the god . It was big . It was tremendous and he wanted to tell about it . Other people knew it , of course , but still it was his personal experience . Consubstantiation  --  he saw the word in his own handwritingon ruled paper , recalling the close smell of sunlight through glass falling on pine desks , the sharp , cedar-andrubbertaste of the chewed end of the pencil . Con- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And this was it again . Blasphemous to say the word about these Navajo things  --  he did n't care , here where the lightning rustled in Nayeinezgani'squiver . He thought defiantly of Mr. Snyder . Consubstantiation . He was changed , and he wanted her to see it . He wanted to see her again . His nostrils were assailed by smoke , dust , and the smell of cooking . Following Warriors had gone off on an errand , but his cousin was waiting by his uncle 's wagon . I 'm going to wander around a little , ' he told her as he dropped his bridle and rope . I 'll eat somewhere . ' He pulled a blanket out of the wagon . She said , ' All right . ' On impulse , he asked , ' Is Skinny Boy around ? ' Her expression changed very slightly , ' I do n't know . ' He grinned and she looked down . He sauntered off , knowing that he was hungry and food would be plentiful . There were lots of people , many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of news . Deer Woman , his aunt , stood in her wagon passing things down to her husband . She greeted him with a gay ' Hallah hotsan. ' ' and handed him the Dutch oven . Her husband took his hand with a smile . He helped them make camp , giving the news of Ha'anoichi.  |p169'Why  do n't you let your hair grow ? ' she asked him . ' I have n't any wife to do it up for me . ' ' There are lots of them here . ' ' I 'm look around . ' He turned away , then stopped andlooked back . ' If I find one , it will cost you sheep and horses . ' She laughed . ' Get one to suit me , and I 'll help pay for her . ' Yellow Man , her husband , said , ' Come back here and eat . ' ' Good . I will . ' He drifted on . Many people , many kinds of people , faces of unlike character , old men , children , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boy hailed him . ' Where to , horse-tamer ? ' They put hands on each other 's shoulders . ' Just walking around . When did you get here ? ' ' A little while ago . Come over to our camp . ' ' No , I 'm looking around . My uncle 's working and my aunt 's gone off somewhere . There 's no one at our wagon but Willow Girl . ' He pointed towards where it stood , near the medicine lodge . ' So I thought I 'd drift . ' Skinny Boy gave him a grateful look . ' I think I 'll drift , too . I 'll see you later . ' It was getting truly cold as Sun Bearer rested on the edge of the west before he went under . Myron pulled his blanket well around his shoulders . Then he saw her . She was stand/ing , surveying the crowd , at midpoint between the fire and where she had picked up the frying-pan . Her mother , a pleasant , firm-looking , solid woman , knelt by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had his back turned , swinging an axe down on a knotty chunk of fuel . Myron stood just outside the edge of their zone , his heart beating . That was juniper , it was she . She saw him , her eyes alert , speaking , then she looked away . He realized that she could not account to her parents for knowing him . What sort of people were they ? He could have made the acquaintance of any unknown family in the gathering , easily and naturally , but not hers . She knelt to the fire , setting the pan to get hot while she moulded a tortilla . He drifted on , feeling empty . Working his way out of the crowd , at the outer edge he found himself facing a small fire in front of a car . He was thinking as he approached it that it must have taken some driving to get here , then he saw that the people at the fire were white , a man and a woman , accompanied by some kind of Indian who wore his hair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Indian was speaking English . He was young , and wore a wide , black hat . Some kind of Pueblo , Myron decided . It upset him to see white people here , as if this inner country was n't as safe as he had thought it to be . The car had a New Mexico licence . The white man looked up and said , ' Hello . ' Myron just stared , his face blank . ' Can you tell me when the dance comes out ? ' he asked politely . With slow stupidity the boy answered , ' Shi do pehozn da . ' The Indian said , ' Amigo , cuando sale el baile ? ' Shi do pehozn da . ' The woman laughed . Myron yielded to the temptation to smile ; he did n't feel disagreeable towards these people , just wanted no traffic with them . He walked off . That was a lot of trouble , driving all the way here fromp171New Mexico . Indians with braided hair lived around Santa Fe , far beyond Gallup . That man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hair . None of them would be able to understand what they 'd come to see . Two trucks stood parked together . Tall Man sat on the running-board of one of them , looking smart and modern in big hat , silk scarf , bright lumberjack , and beaded gauntlets . Two young men , short-haired , lounged in the other . There were half a dozen cases in the bottom of it . Myron thought he 'd like to get to know Tall Man , there was someonereally smart . He wondered if he 'd been initiated . One of the young men said in English , ' Want some pop ? ' He considered the question briefly . ' I guess not . It 's too cold . ' ' We ai n't got no white mule dis trip . ' They both laughed and Tall Man smiled . ' I 'm headin for coffee , ' Myron told them . Tall Man said , ' This is bad weather for pop . ' ' Yeah . But we 'll sell some . ' ' You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Myron thought of a lot of things he 'd like to say to the delegate , but you could n't shift right from kidding into serious talk . He got to Deer Woman 's fire just as the goat 's ribs were sizzling on the coals . Following Warriors and Willow Girl were there , so was Skinny Boy . Other people dropped in . He could eat and not pay attention to the occasional talk . It was dark by the time eating was over . Eight bonfires enclosed the rectangular dancing-space in front of the medicine hogahn . Around them formed the wider rectangle of people , with small fires here and there . Shooting Singer and the patient came out of the hogahn and stood facing east . The four First Dancers , the Atsa Tlei in their masks , with Talking God , came quietly into the space . Myron did n't notice them until the watcher called , ' Come on the trail of beauty ! ' He left his family and moved to the front ,  |p172where  the heat of the big blazes reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The medicine man began a long prayer , each line repeated by the patient as a litany . In the house made of dawn , In the house made of dawn , In the house made of evening , In the house made of evening .. . Myron listened intently to the great words . In the house made of dark cloud , In the house made of dark cloud , In the house made of he-rain .. . Could this really make a sick man well ? Surely it was possible . It would be great if that haggard-looking man there was really cured tomorrow . With the dark thunder above you , Come to us soaring , With the shapen cloud at your feet , Come to us soaring , With the far darkness of he-rain over your head , Come to us soaring .. . His uncle 's deep voice , his certain , devoted face , his uncle 's power . The patient repeated the lines with equal feeling . He had no doubts . With zigzag lightning high outflung over your head , Come to us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Come to us soaring , With the far darkness of dark clouds on the ends of your wings , Come to us soaring .. . Each image stated twice , driving the words home until standing there he saw it all in full colour , the piled-up at/tributes and circumstances which between them compassed the nature of a god 's approach . With darkness on the earth , come to us . And I wish the foam floating in the flowingwater at the roots of the great corn . I have made your sacrifice . I have prepared your smoke . My feet restore for me . My legs restore for me .. . It swept him up in conviction . This must surely work . But that was n't all of it . He knew from his uncle that it was n't just the sick man , in a way he was the excuse . They Lame to the end of the declaration  --  In beauty I walk , Free of pain I walk , Feeling light within I walk , With lively feelings I walk , and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passing showers , abundant growing things , fair white corn to the ends of the earth , yellow corn , blue corn , all kinds of corn , jewels of all kinds  --  With these all around you , may they come in beauty .. .

That was himself , his relatives , everyone , the creaking wagons and small horses moving in all directions tomorrow , the ordinary people going to their own places , and the blessing over them , spreading out . It is done in beauty , It is done in beauty !  |p174They  scattered pollen on the waiting dancers and sat down in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Talking God 's cry signalled the First Dancers to begin . He found a place to sit down where he could see well and be comfortable , and would not be talked to , near the east end of the northern line . After the First Dancers were through , the Naakai came out , six gods and six goddesses with Talking God again , and Water Sprinkler . He listened to their thunderous , exciting song , familiar to him because people had been whistling it ever since the first frost . A man sitting next him borrowed a match , and made an inconsequential joke when he refused tobacco . Forty-eight times between now and dawn the dance would be performed , the teams alternating with all but identical songs . You did n't need to pay attention . Watching the first performance , he was disappointed , too inexperienced to notice niceties of footwork , but even so the music , carried on the syllables of a meaningless song , reached to him . It was harsh , it was surprisingly deep in pitch , resonant behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back , letting the shifting dazzle of the fires clear from his eyes , and there were the stars , remote and clear and manifold , and the night air on his face . After a pause , the second team of Naakai came out . The word savage came to his mind as he responded to the disharmonies and at the same time was bothered by them . Ohoho ho howe heya heya Ohoho ho hehehe heya heyaHabi niye habi niye .. . People talked and moved about . The cold came up through the ground , it flowed in a shallow river just over the skin of the earth , and turned his blanket to cotton . He sat up . Gettingclose to the bonfires was no good , they scorched your face while your back froze , but people were kindling smaller blazes where you could draw near . Behind the hats and headsp175and standing figures wagon tops loomed ghostly . He stood up and began picking his way among the people , thinking two things at once . He need n't have been so shy , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were crowded . A man called to him sharply ; he held his foot , about to descend on a sleeping child , and exclaimed . At the second lire he joined the group which stood close around , facing outwards . The warmth soaked into his legs , his seat , his shoulders , while he still searched . Over there  --  no . He watched that fire , and was sure , knowing he could always spot the set of her head , but he held back , telling himself he was n't sure . It did n't matter anyhow , this was a good place . The second team of dancers went out . The man next him asked where he was from , they talked together , mentioning the white people and the Indian with them . Another man said the Indian was a Tewa from around Bead Water . They all took time to consider the whites , and the two men agreed it was a fine thing , hojoni , for aliens to come so far and lend their interest , their help , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sprinkler made everyone laugh , as he was supposed to do , coming in late and getting lost . Talking God gave his cry , and the music crashed again . Myron went straight to the other fire . Perhaps because of the women  --  Juniper and her mother and another matron with a child in her lap  --  most of the people here were sitting . Beside Bay Horse , her father , was a familiar youth ; he tried to remember that alert , handsome face  --  Singing Gambler . Irritation was first , but realization of the opening given him outstripped it . He walked into the close circle and stood staring down at his acquaintance . Singing Gambler raised his head slowly , their eyes met , for a moment both were serious , and then as recognition came to him , both smiled broadly and Myron squatted . ' Hallah hotsan ! ' ' Hallahani ! '  |p176They  took each other 's hands and pulled at each other slightly . Myron did n't really feel as cordial as all that , but other factors made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Now here 's a man with a real voice . ' Juniper 's father said , ' Sit down . Be warm . ' He seemed an agreeable man . ' You still have my bracelet , ' Singing Gambler said . ' Yes . How 's the pinto ? ' ' I traded him . Do you want a race tomorrow ? ' ' I do n't know . I may be sleepy . ' ' Where from ? ' Bay Horse asked . ' Ha'anoichi . My uncle is Shooting Singer . ' That placed him , he knew . He felt himself to be wily when he asked , ' And you , where from ? ' He had n't looked at juniper yet . ' The Rim above T'o Tlakai . My brother is helping your uncle . ' Myron nodded . ' That 's his wife . ' Bay Horse indicated the woman with the infant , who smiled at him . In making himself comfortable , he shifted his position , so that he could see Juniper . Her blanket drawn across the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well enough , but he guessed the amused look in her eyes . ' I thought you were going back to school , ' Singing Gambler said . ' So did I , but here I am , using pollen . ' He thought he saw the edge of her blanket move , her eyes open slightly . Ohoho ho hehehe heya . The song was a background . Returning Wisely 's Wife said , ' I 've heard your uncle speak of you . ' ' What have you been doing since we sang in the rain ? ' Singing Gambler asked . ' Harvesting , moving down to the winter range  --  all like that . And you ? '  |p177The  boy grinned , the swift flash that made his face give light . ' Riding around , just riding around . ' He wore a new , fine blanket over the oldest , shabbiest clothes , a handsome turquoise ring , and brand-new silk headband . Myron envied him . Myron 's clothes were of even quality , with nothing showy . Bay Horse drew a laugh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this part of the country , and still he 's thin . ' Singing Gambler asked , ' Have you learnt to smoke yet , schoolboy ? ' With a purpose , Myron answered , ' I 'm learning . Have you tobacco ? ' He had n't , but Bay Horse handed him a sack and a package of brown papers . Myron said , ' This may cost you a lot of tobacco , ' as he started rolling . His clumsiness diverted them all . The two women and the girl , a man standing by the fire sideways to them , a man sitting behind , were drawn together in amusement . Myron began to giggle . They were all laughing , and Juniper let the blanket fall away from her face . ' Juniper 's mother  --  her name was Red Woman  --  said , ' Here , give it to me . ' She made a cigarette deftly and passed it over . ' Can you smoke it , or shall I blow on it for you ? ' The man sitting behind said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out . ' He heard Juniper 's laugh , distinct among the rest . He knew her voice only in seriousness ; this sound rounded out her humanity in a surprising way . He was blushing . Well , they 'd think it was for other reasons . Red Woman made a cigarette for herself and passed the makings along , but Myron had the whole audience as he started smoking , and his best act yet to come . He puffed gingerly . They were all united now , as if they were inside someone 's hogahn , and everyone was looking right at everybody else . The singing had stopped again , he 'd forgotten hep178was hearing it . When he thought the time was ripe , he drew in a deep puff , and the bursts of coughing that followed were so genuine he could n't entirely appreciate his success . The coughing shifted the run of his own feelings . As he lay catching his breath , he knew that he could have no direct talk with her here . He looked sidelong at Singing Gambler , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but only because she was special . There were things he needed to say to her , but it was out of the question . He was getting turned aside from the hojoni , the happy beauty which validated the ceremony . He threw the rest of his cigarette into the fire . ' I must wander along , ' he said , rising . ' Let us know if you come over the mountain , ' Bay Horse told him . Juniper 's eyes met his , quick , complete . He kept his face plain with an effort . Had she told him , or he her ? He walked straight back , north , until he left the crowd and the encircling wagons , and squatted , his blanket pulled close about him , in solitude. 0 hobo ho hehehe heya , Eo lado eo lade eo lade eo lade nashe ... The song pursued him . One did not have to listen to it , it continued of itself inside one ; it was not a thing to be watched , but in which one lived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon him . He looked up at the stars , the music might be coming from them . Behind the silent wagons the qualities of firelight showed and shifted . He waited long . At last he saw her coming and rose . He hoped she did n't think  --  expectTwo blanketed figures , boy and girl , facing each other in the darkness through a long silence ; he 'd seen it before , at the Anaji , on other occasions of gatherings , but it seemed odd to be part of that himself . In the starlight her eyes and mouth were shadows , as he remembered them before . They stood a long time without speaking . It was all right , it did not conflict with hojoni , the path of beauty . He had feared that desire would leap up in him , alien to the cere/mony of which they were partaking , but instead he felt rather blank and dry inside . The vivid contact-sense of details of her body which he recalled sometimes , was missing ; he saw her in her heavy blanket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and no speech came out of him . Finally he said , ' I wanted to see you . ' It sounded ridiculous . Then with an effort , ' I 've been thinking about you . ' She was as shy as he . ' So you stayed here , after all ? ' ' Yes . I handled the pollen the other day . ' He meant to tell her more than that , but how could one talk , standing here where people might come , where her parents might look for her ? ' Your Hasteen Bucla , what did he say ? ' ' I did n't go to him . I made up my mind , after I left that place . ' He could see her well enough to think she looked pleased . ' I 'll stay here till next fall , I think , then perhaps I 'll go back to school . ' ' Then you 'll be at school a long time , when you go ? ' ' I do n't know . Perhaps . ' He dredged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a corner of his attention , he was alert for anyone coming . ' Things are different . ' Her right hand moved and came out from under a fold of her blanket . He could see it , held laxly near her left side . He could lock fingers with it and stand so , but that was courtship . He did n't intend that , he only wanted her to understand'I wanted to talk with you , ' he said . ' We ca n't talk like this . ' She did n't help him . Her hand went back under the blanket . ' I shall be travelling around , ' he went on . ' I think I 'll he coming by your place . ' ' You can eat there , ' she said . The answer was hospitable , but her tone indifferent . He knew he 'd failed again . If only he could tell her . Nowp18ohe wanted her fingers , and reached out , but she made no move , and when he touched her arm under the blanket it was entirely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting her again so warmly , understanding , communication . ' That boy , Singing Gambler , do you see him often ? ' ' He came by once this fall , and turned up tonight , ' she said carelessly . ' You know how he drifts around . ' Myron knew that , and his gaiety and charm and selfassurance . But what to say ? How to say anything ? Where had this gone so wrong ? He had to go back to school yet , to be away from the Navajos . He could n't do or be anything permanent now . ' My mother will be wondering about me , ' she said , and with that she left him . He watched her go . When she was at the nearer wagons , he wanted to call her back , but he did n't . He sat down on a wagon tongue . What 's the matter with me ? Now he knew what he should have said . Too late now , only it must n't just end like this . A man was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . How long had the music been going on , how many re-entrances ? He did n't know . He felt tired , and guilty at letting himself go into scattered , unhappy thoughts . His being turned towards the ceremony for relief . After getting another blanket from their wagon , he found his aunts and his cousins , and Skinny Boy and his parents , and lay down among them . One could talk a little , watch , lie back and see the sky , stare into a fire , doze , watch again . The performance wove itself through sleeping and waking and coloured every posture of the night . Talking God 's neat stepping took him along the lines and back , the rattles sounded like rain beginning as the dancers swung about , their voices rose again , their feet moved together . In drowsiness it blurred until it permeated the whole world . During the pauses between dances , he could hear faintly the quieter chants inside the lodge and the dull thudding of the basket drum . It went on until it had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was different , a change ran among the people ; he sat up , blinking , and heard the first Finishing Song come from the medicine lodge . The east was turning white . He got up and went over there , but the place was crowded , so he sat down outside . The four short songs ended . He recognized his uncle 's voice praying . Then it was over . Men were leaving the hogahn . Tall Man came out  --  so he had been initiated . He went to the door , where he could see his uncle and Returning Wisely and the patient . From where he sat rolling a cigarette , Bay Horse looked up and smiled . Myron turned to the east , thinking the dawn prayers as he walked . Some of the people were beginning to move , some slept . Under the wagons many were rolled up in their blankets . People were going for water , down to the thin flow of the creek below the encampment . He walked out to where he could see the line . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daybreak , with colour beginning to show and people and horses looking flat . He saw Red Woman going down , carrying a pail . He turned back . Returning Wisely 's Wife was alone at the wagon . He scouted again , looking through the crowd , then to the country roundabout . Juniper was dragging a long , dead branch . He went out to meet her . She stopped where she was , looking at the ground . Listen to me , ' he said . ' Understand me . I know you 're angry with me , but understand . I  --  I 'm mixed up . I 'm just finding out . Do you see ? I have to know  --  to know what I am . Then I 'm coming to see you . ' She raised her eyes . All right . ' Then she smiled and her eyes danced . Do n't wait too long , Mixed-up Boy . I might not wait . ' His spirits rose with the relief . ' I 'm worth something , too , ' he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Perhaps . ' She drawled the word , looking at him sidelong , and laughed , and then she went on , dragging the stick of fuel.  |p182Where  the sheep were grazing in the box canyon it was safe enough to leave them during lunch . He 'd ridden out with Willow Girl to help her get them across the wash , and then stayed for the morning , helping a little , talking idly , loafing there where the walls reflected warmth and it was pleasant enough in the sun . He took his cousin up behind his saddle , and as they rode down the main canyon , began teasing her about Skinny Boy . They had n't seen him since they moved to their winter camp , save at the Night Chant . ' Do n't be silly , ' she said . ' I like him all right , but he 's too young , and so am I. I 'm not thinking about those things yet . ' She was fifteen . ' That 's right , ' Myron told her . ' But does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . The work 's easier since you 're here , but with the sheep and all , she 'd like someone else camping with her , I think . But she wants a high price ; anyhow , I 'm not ready . ' ' Even Skinny Boy ? ' ' Even Skinny Boy . ' ' You 're right , I think . We do n't like those ways any more . I 'll help you if it comes along . ' His cousin had surprisedhim , she always seemed so old-fashioned . Fifteen is too young . I 'm sixteen , and I 'm too young . ' He fell silent , staring between his horse 's ears . Sixteen is too young . I told juniper  --  not too young for that , the hot , sweet touch . I think of her so much . Love , perhaps , I must n't love an ignorant , I want  --  Juniper , War Encircling . I 've got to find out soon and then go see her , straighten this out , have her understand , special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accord into the road across the wash . In the end I go back to schoolLook , a car ! ' Myron stared all around . ' Where ? '  |p183'Its  tracks , on the road . ' Tire marks showed here and there in the half-frozen ground . Myron 's heart turned over . What was a car doing over this way ? Had they come after him ? Willow Girl said , ' What do you suppose it is ? ' ' I do n't know . ' ' What 's the matter ? ' ' I 'm thinking  --  if it 's a Washington car come after me . ' ' What will you do ? We do n't want you to go back now . I do n't . ' Her last words pleased him . He 'd never been sure just what she did think of him . ' I 'll hide . You 'll tell them  --  tell them someone like Singing Gambler came along and we rode off together . We  --  we were on our way to a Night Chant at  --  at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dennihatso . ' ' Good . ' ' All right . But if you waited I could sneak out to you with some lunch . ' Myron snorted . ' This country 's full of places to eat lunch . ' He knew now . He 'd chosen back there when Talking God touched him , when he fed the masks , although it was Nayeinezgani he followed . You have to be one or the other , you ca n't be both . Why have I waited so long ? He felt light , the world was clear . I 've taken this side . ' Where will you really go ? ' Willow Girl was thrilled . ' I do n't know . Just go around for a couple of days . ' This afternoon , tomorrow morning . The sorrel 's in good shape . Juniper . By noon tomorrow . ' Listen . Graze up around that same place , and farther up . I wo n't come back to the hogahn , I 'll come to you first , and you can tell me if it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They rounded the butte by the drop into the arroyo , and saw the car , black and solid , standing beside the road justp184where it went down . Myron reined in sharply , they both gasped and sat watching . ' No one in it , ' he said , and then , ' it is n't a Washington car . ' ' How do you know ? ' ' That piece of metal they put on ; Washington cars have it with white tracks on blue . This one is red and yellow . ' He puzzled . ' Whose do you think it is ? ' ' I do n't know . Could it be those white people who came to the dance ? ' ' No . They had a big , blue car . ' They were alongside it now , eyeing the short-snouted Ford . ' It 's Tall Man , perhaps , ' Willow Girl said . ' No . The painted plate is wrong for him . That yellowplate comes from east of the mountains . But it must beIndians . Down towards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the road and the loose sand by the creek-bed . ' Two men went across , ' Myron said . ' One of them walkslike an Indian . ' ' Yes . ' ' I guess I 'll go see . Hold on . ' He quirted his pony up the farther bank and made for the hogahn at a good trot . Nothing seemed unusual . Smoke rose from the centre of the earth-and-log dome , no one stood outside . He went in behind his cousin . Nobody spoke as he entered . He had straightened up and was still staring when Mr. Butler said , ' Hello , Myron . I 'm glad to see you , my boy . ' Myron knew he said ' Hello , ' but did n't hear himself . He was shaking hands . It was Mr. Butler . Even to this far place , to the winter camp , Mr. Butler had come . He sat down . It could not have been more monstrously significant if the academic building at Yellow Earth had come walking down the canyon after him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Myron supposed the strange Indian was an interpreter , like John at Tsaili.  | ' It 's been a long time , ' Mr. Butler said . ' And I had trouble finding this place . ' Myron did n't answer . Everyone was waiting . Willow Girl was expecting him to do something , but he could n't . It was Mr. Butler . Food was set forth , and they ate , without heartiness . Mr. Butler ate out of the pot like an Indian . He seemed comfortable in the hogahn , he was the only person really at ease . He made a few remarks in his mispronounced yet competent Navajo , to which Shooting Singer responded briefly . When they had eaten , the missionary said : ' I 've told your uncle that you must finish your schooling . I told him how well you had been doing . You 've missed two months now , Myron ; it 's time you came back . ' Myron stared at the fire . He had expected a flood of reproaches . ' I expect you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right ? ' Myron nodded . ' I 've made other arrangements . I want you to come back with me . ' Myron told his uncle , ' He wants me to go to school again . ' ' When we wrote those letters , ' Shooting Singer said slowly , we promised to return you . But I was happy . Good thingswere happening . You have to go , I think . ' Myron said in English , ' All right . ' Myron sat beside Mr. Butler , while the interpreter lounged with jolted somnolence in the back seat . The road improved after it climbed out of the canyon , and shortly joined a better one , which allowed the driver to relax and talk . ' I could n't come before , ' he said . ' I was afraid I would n't be able to get away before snowfall . ' Then , after a pause , ' I was truly sorry when Paul Snyder wrote me that you had n't come back . What happened ? ' Juniper , Shooting Singer , Nayeinezgani. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easy to stay where you are , just stay on . I think you'dp186been away from the reservation too long . I do n't blame your uncle , he seems to be a fine man . But of course , he does n't know , he ca n't really understand the importance of keeping up your schooling . ' The road was bad for a spell . They were climbing a southern , lower extension of Chiz Lan Hojoni Mountain , a long , slow grade that made the engine pull . The two red tracks of the road went on and on , broken in places by dips , twisting a little , with grey-green low vegetation between them and grey-green bushes on either side . ' He said you were initiated in the Yeibichai Dance . Why did you do that ? ' ' I du n no . ' Mr. Butler 's eyes were on the road . He looked disappointed . He was n't acting the way Mr. Snyder would . Myron made an effort . ' I guess I wanted to know . You  --  you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My uncle said dat . I just  --  kinda  --  went along . ' ' That means you offered pollen to the masks . ' Yessir . ' How did he know ? ' That 's worship , you know . You 're a Christian , you know , Myron , and you worshipped false gods . Surely you do n't believe there 's anything sacred about a painted buckskin bag pulled over a man 's head . ' Buckskin bag . ' No , sir . I guess not . ' ' You must not bear false witness against your God . " Thou shalt have none other gods before Me . " In the end you know , God will find you out . ' Myron stared at the road ahead . God could reach over the mountains , to the remotest canyon . He overstepped all boundaries . ' I want you to stay in touch with your people . PerhapsMr . Butler hesitated , then said , ' Perhaps Snyder was not quite the man for you . I 've arranged for you to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you will like the Reverend Charles Rensselaer there . You have a career to make ; I 'd be sorry to see you let go and sink back . ' At the top of the long climb , the divide , the road turned southward for a hundred yards . On his right hand Myron could see all the majestic , wild country he was leaving , mesa and butte and hill and canyon , and looking over his shoulder made out where jumbled red rock piled like whirling water . A black volcanic dike was a knife-like line of shadow across hart of it ; near that was T'o Tlakai , and juniper 's wine hogahn . War Encircling . So that was over , and he nestraightened it out . God reached out  --  the kingdom , the power , and the glory  --  the power  --  Navajo is nothing , civilized is strength is Christian Slayer of Enemy Gods but God turns back the arrow . Sometimes Mr. Butler spoke , sometimes he was silent for long periods . He did not press hard , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . No search for the shameful . Towards sunset they had supper at a trading post , and shortly thereafter swung onto the long highway to Gallup . The sun was gone to the west side of the mountains . Night Closed down . The car made a steady , roaring sound over the graded road , its lights spreading an area of brightness into t he night . That was what Myron remembered afterward ; being tired in the front seat , the road turned to a river under the lights , and Mr. Butler talking , understandable , clear , wise , talking . The power.  | MYRON glanced at the restaurant door out of the corner of his eye as he went past . There was a short , pockmarked Mexican leaning against the wall beside it . He went on down San Francisco Street , stood and rubbered in the window of a curio store , then came slowly back . He was going in this time , he had to go in . Half the door stood open . He could look through to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and the tables along either side . A couple of men were sitting at one , there was the bartender at the back , otherwise the place was empty . The man by the door winked and spoke to him in Spanish . Myron started , felt guilty , settled his face , and answered , ' No Babe . ' ' No sabe , eh ? ' The man said . ' You from de school ? ' ' Yeah . ' ' Lookin for a leetle home-brew ? ' Myron started to exclaim ' No ! ' but checked himself . ' Maybe . I 'm lookin for a friend of mine . He said he 'd be in here . ' Eendian boy ?

The man behind the bar said , ' Hello , John . What is it ? '  |p192Myron  made himself speak . ' I 'm lookin for Don White Elk . He told me to meet him here . ' That big boy with the hook nose ? ' ' Yeah . Dat 's him . ' He 's in back , go on in . ' The man jerked his head towards a door . Myron turned the knob and went through to a second , smaller room , holding half a dozen uncovered tables and some plain chairs . The place was utterly free of decoration . Don sat at one of the tables , staring at a glass of beer . He wore white flannel trousers , full-cut , a black shirt with white buttons , pale yellow tie , and a citified , small felt hat on the back of his head . He looked up and stared in surprise . ' Well  --  what the hell are you doin here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table , looking down . White Elk smiled feebly . ' Aw , what 's the matter ? Do n't be like that , big boy . Sit down . ' Myron understood that it took a lot of beer to make a person drunk . He guessed the Arapaho had only just started . ' I was lookin for you , ' he said . ' Say , we ai n't startin practice today , are we ? ' ' No . It 's not dat . But gee , Don , Mr. Rensselaer , and Mr. Cowring , and all of dem are huntin for you . ' Don 's expression changed , tightened . ' What for ? Serafina , hunh ? ' Yess . ' ' And you bein their pet dog , you told ' em I was likely here , and they sent you a-runnin after me , hunh ?

He 'd taken it on himself to do this thing , the beginning of his calling ; he 'd do it right . He drew a deep breath.  | ' I came after you , Don , so 's to help you . Gee , you can get into a lot of trouble if you are n't careful . ' ' Looks like I was in plenty trouble now , or Serafina is . ' He laughed shortly . ' Has she had her baby ? ' Yeah . She had it about two weeks ago , but her folks only just learned it was you . ' ' What do they want me to do ? ' ' Dey want to take you out dere . ' ' And marry me to that Pueblo squaw ? Nothin doin . ' Myron stared down at him , checking fresh anger at the word ' squaw . ' The Oklahoma Indians were always sneering at the Southwestern people . And this was sin , just what you heard about . ' Look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dey 're huntin for you . When dey catch you dey 'll take you out dere anyhow . Or dey might stick you in jail .

' ' Gee , Don ' Myron made a helpless gesture . ' Well , Serafina 's a nice girl . And den , we been roomin togedder , and dere 's de team , and allDon nodded . ' You 're a funny guy . Sittin on the bed preachin sermons when I start to tell the boys about the fun I been havin . And pourin my whiskey out o ' the winder . And then comin after me like this . ' He grinned . ' I bet you had kittens , comin in here . ' He stared at his glass , and drank down to the yeasty sediment . ' Well , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I do her . I guess you 're right . Let 's get it over with . ' Myron 's heart leaped . Don was wrong , of course . Serafinawas a good girl . He 'd marry her , and then he 'd straighten out and be all right . ' You are n't drunk , are you ? ' he asked  |p194Hell  , no . Not on one glass . ' White Elk rose . Say , you come with me , hunh ? ' Myron hesitated . The busses from the reservations would be coming in today , and he wanted to be there if jack had got his transfer , but he could n't quit on Don now , since he 'd started this . ' All right . Better get someting to take de smell off you . ' ' How come you know so much ? ' Listenin to you . ' Don bought Sen-Sen at the bar . As they walked towards school in the bright sunshine , he meditated . ' Say , Myron , ' he said , ' if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all over me . You go tell him I 'm willin to act nice , and get him to lay offa me , will ya ? ' ' All right . ' ' Trainin starts tomorrow , ' Don said . ' But you 're always in trainin . You do n't know what it means . I was a fool to come back here . ' Myron did n't answer . Even though you knew they were wrong , the Eastern Indians at the school , from Oklahoma and Dakota and those places , made you feel like a rube . Don was one of the worst , but you could n't beat him on the football field . They recognized Mr. Rensselaer 's car among others in front of the administration building . I guess I 'll wait here , ' Don said , sitting on the runningboard . You are n't goin to run off ? ' Nope . I plant my stick here . ' Myron went up the steps and into the office . Mr. Cowring the Superintendent , Mr. James the Principal , Mr. Rensselaer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him in surprise . ' What is it , Myron ? ' Mr. Cowring asked . ' Don  --  Don 's outside . He says  --  I mean  --  I guess he feels like he kinda wants to do whatever you say . '  |p195Astonishment  spread on their faces , then Mr. Rensselaer began to smile , looking approvingly at Myron . ' You 're sure you want to take him out there ? ' Cowring said . ' Of course , ' Rensselaer told him . ' Ready , Father ? ' The Superintendent said , ' I 've got a couple of things tofinish up . Then I 'll be along if you want me . ' ' We expect your help , ' Rensselaer answered . ' Certainly . ' At the door , Myron tugged at the clergyman 's arm . ' Mr. Rensselaer . ' ' Yes , my boy ? ' ' Do n't  --  do n't scold him , please . He 's goin to be all right . ' Rensselaer stared a moment , then smiled . ' All right , Myron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants me to come along . ' ' That 's fine . ' He followed them to the car where Don stood sullenly waiting . He felt triumphant and acclaimed . Soldier of Christ . The clergyman and priest occupied the front seat , a little stiffly . The complications of marriage between a Protestant and a Catholic had not been settled between them , and they were watchful of each other . After they had gone several miles , Don asked , without looking at Myron , ' Is it a boy or a girl ? ' ' I tink it 's a girl . ' Don grunted . Myron glanced at him from time to time . Don was going to marry Serafina and then he 'd straighten out . He 'd see the light . You could n't let a guy go to jail . He was such a swell athlete . Next hat I get , Myron decided , I 'll get a little one like that . Big hats  --  rubes  --  those clothes cost money . ' Say , Don , ' he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy dem clothes in Santa Fe ? ' Don was glad of something to talk about . His sullen look decreased.  |p196'I  got the tie here , but the rest I bought in St. Louis . ' ' St. Louis ! ' ' Sure . We got up a team this summer , eight of us boys , and went on the road . ' ' Team ? Oh  --  dancin . ' ' Yeah , any kinda dance you want , only do n't forget to say it 's a war dance . We went to Hot Springs and Pipin Rock and all them places . Boy , we had fun . ' He grinned . ' Plenty tail . White girls . ' Myron wished he had n't spoken . Don was bad . Don and Serafina  --  well , there 'd been juniper . It could just kind of happen . Of course he knew Don was loose , but bragging on it now when he ought to be sorry ... He wondered where Juniper was now . Married probably . Last year  --  two years . Two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reservation and the way he backslid . But Mr. Rensselaersaid that since he 'd really repented and gotten over it , he should think of it as a valuable experience . He said it would be an inoculation . I 've tried to make up for it . They had left the highway and were jouncing over the dirt road to the Pueblo . Myron had been there once before . It seemed deserted , just one woman came to a door and looked at them , and a dog drifted across the plaza . They held their dances out here , right in front of the church . It did n't make sense . Father Adolph led the way to a house . Don , stiff with resistance , tagged close behind Myron . The family had been waiting for them . There were Serafina and her baby , her father and mother , her elder brother and sisters . The others greeted Mr. Rensselaer and Father Adolph politely  --  they all spoke English  --  treating the priest with marked respect , but she stayed in a corner , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her father  --  his name was Agapito Batista  --  told them all to sit down . Myron took a chair in a corner , where he was out of the way . He thought perhaps he ought to have stayedp197outside , but he wanted to see what happened , and what a Pueblo house was like . The big , whitewashed room was neat . At one end was a double bed with a very clean counterpane , there were an oilcloth-coveredtable on which a lamp stood , and plenty of chairs . A pole hung parallel to the long back wall , with ceremonial garments folded over it , the heavy shawls embroidered with symbols of rain and the returning seasons , blankets , buckskin leggings , strips of beadwork . Two war bonnets hung on pegs , and on another peg were a bunch of shell and turquoise necklaces and a rosary . There were several photographs on the walls , two pictures of saints , and a brilliant calendar carrying greetings in English and Spanish from a store in Espanola . Myron looked at the people . Agapitoand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were dressed like hard-working whites . One minute you thought how civilized they all were , the next you decided they were just ignorant Indians . Agapito asked if the road had dried out . It rained a little yesterday . Then there was a space of silence , and just as Mr. Rensselaer cleared his throat another car drove up and Mr. Cowring came in with Miss Liter , the Girls ' Advisor . There were more greetings , and the Advisor talked to Serafina a moment , examining the baby . Serafina smiled faintly . Then again the silence hung . Myron looked at Don . You could get nothing out of his face . Serafina 's family seemed calm . Mr. Rensselaer turned to the Superintendent . ' I was just about to say  --  ah  --  that I understand that Donald here is willing to do the right thing . ' Don stared at the floor . Serafina lowered her head so you could n't see her face . The missionary continued , ' This is a most unfortunate occurrence , but I am happy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He spoke slowly , to make sure that the Indians understood him . ' I think the thing to do is to get a licence and have them married right off . '  |p198Father  Adolph said , ' At the same time I can baptize thebaby . You wo n't have to wait for my regular visit . ' Rensselaer said , ' Perhaps Donald would prefer to have itbaptized in his own church . What do you say , Don ? ' Don made no answer . Father Adolph leaned forward . ' This is a Catholic family , the child is a Pueblo child . A Catholic wedding and baptism are inevitable . ' Rensselaer cleared his throat and looked grim . He was about to speak when the Superintendent interrupted him . ' Suppose we hear from these folks . What do you say , Agapito ? ' The Indian turned and spoke to his daughter in Tewa . She answered briefly . He spoke again . His son said something , his wife made a remark , he spoke at some length , then he turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Don answered in a low voice , ' Oklahoma . I 'm an Arapaho . ' Agapito said something else in Tewa and his wife seemed to agree . ' She do n't want to marry heem , ' he announced . Myron stared . Don looked once , swiftly , at the girl , and let out a slow breath . Father Adolph said , ' Do you realize what you 're saying , Agapito ? ' Rensselaer exclaimed , ' But she must marry him ! She ca n't have an illegitimate child , you know . ' Agapito said : ' He 's no good . We do n't want heem . She 'll feeneesh school , and by-m-by she 'll marry a Tewa boy . ' ' But the child ' the priest said . ' De child 's all right . She 's got her folks . She do n't need no Oklahoma husband . ' Rensselaer said : ' Let the girl speak for herself . Her ideas may be different . Serafina , my dear . ' Serafina barely moved her head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to do the right thing , and we 'll all stand by you . We respectp199your father and mother , but  --  but surely you want to marry Don ? Do n't you ? ' In a very small voice she said , ' No , sir . ' Miss Liter rose and went over to her , and knelt beside her chair , laying her hand over the girl 's . ' Are you sure , my dear ? ' ' Yes 'm . ' The young woman remained there , looking at the baby . Father Adolph sighed . ' I rather feared this would happen . ' Rensselaer jerked his head towards the Superintendent . ' Ca n't you do something about this , Walter ? It 's monstrous . ' Cowring shook his head . ' I 've been through all this before . I can see their side of it . What could I do ? ' ' Order them to marry . ' ' I 've no authority for that . ' ' But you 've got to do something ! ' ' Don @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's all I can do . ' ' And the girl ? ' ' What is there to do about her ? ' ' You wo n't let her back in the school ! ' ' She 's one of our best students . How old are you , Serafina ? ' In a low voice she answered , ' Seventeen . ' ' She 's aiming to be a trained nurse . No , I wo n't cut short her education . ' Rensselaer 's face had become quite red . ' I shall communicate with Washington at once . What about it , Father Adolph ? ' ' In the past , they 've always been sent home . It did n't seem to stop the others . I do n't know . ' ' If the Office instructs me to expel her , ' Cowring said , ' of course I shall do so . I 've been among different kinds of Indians for a good many years . Generally , in my experience , this does n't mean that the girl is bad . It does n't justify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Monstrous ! ' Myron knew what he was thinking . Washington had been crazy these last few years . ' But the baby , you ca n't have that in the dormitory . '  |p200Cowring  said , ' What about the baby , Miss Liter ? ' Miss Liter pondered for a moment . ' Could n't we board it in the hospital ? Then Serafina could learn how to take care of it . And I think it would be a great help in teaching the girls infant care this year . ' Both the priest and the clergyman looked startled , and were about to speak . Cowring cut them off . ' Gentlemen , I think we can continuethis discussion better somewhere else . Let 's go back . ' He glanced at the quiet , attentive Indians . The others took the point and rose . Myron and Don followed them out , climbing into the car behind the two silent men who occupied the front seat . Out of a long silence Don said , ' I do n't want to get fired . ' Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backfield , but of course he had to be fired . ' I want to finish here and then go to Haskell . I do n't want to go home and work on a farm . ' He thought again and added , ' They ai n't a-goin to fire her . Well , the hell with it . ' It was n't fair punishing Don and not her . Everything was haywire . Miss Liter sitting next to her patting her arm . Girls ' Advisor  --  Boys ' Advisor . The Matrons and Disciplinarianshad never stood for that stuff . The Boys ' Advisor was nothing but a Disciplinarian with a new name and no power , anyhow ; he was lazy , that 's how Don had been able to sneak whiskey in . But the Girls ' Advisor was supposed to be something extra special . Miss Liter 'd been to college . There 's the good side , and the bad side , and there they are . Plenty of bad white men , like the ones who sold liquor . This summer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trader gave the Indians flour and sheep to help them hold an Anaji  --  a squaw dance . But Washington used to be on the good side , and now it kept changing around . The Christianswere the only ones who stayed right . You had to be a real Christian . Then you could have a clear conscience and amount to something . Clear conscience  --  Juniper . Wasp201juniper bad ? No . You could n't put that word on a person like her . Ignorant , heathen  --  good people on the bad side . Ethel would know better . Was he bad ? He 'd never told Mr. Rensselaer about that . He 'd repented , but now he was remembering it , he understood a little more about Don and Serafina . As they were driving through town , Don said , ' Well , I wo n't be seem this much longer . ' Myron felt sorry for him . It was an awful thing to be fired . ' I 'm sorry you 're goin , Don , ' he said . ' It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now well into the afternoon , Mr. Rensselaer fed the boys at his own house after dropping Father Adolph . Little was said during the meal , but one could tell that his attitude towards Don was friendly . The boy had been willing to do the right thing ; it was the girl who refused her duty . It was nearly four o'clock when the boys walked onto the school grounds . Two busses and a truck stood on the driveway , and there was another in front of Merritt Lodge . Many boys and girls were drifting about the campus , stopping here and there for greetings , forming groups , or just roving . ' They 're comin in , ' White Elk said . Yeah . ' ' Well , I guess I 'll go to the office and get my orders . ' You 'll be comin up to de room ? ' ' Oh , I guess he wo n't kick me out till tomorrow . So long . ' ' So long . ' Myron was glad to be alone . He drifted across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends , searching . He saw Jack almost as soon as jack saw him . They walked up to each other shyly , their eyes shining . Their hands stayed together . ' How are you , big boy ? ' Jack said . ' Pretty good . When did you get here ? ' ' Just now , in de bus . Ethel and me bot got transferred . '  |p202'Ethel  ? Is she here ? ' Yeah . I ai n't seen her since lunch . She 's around some-wheres . ' ' Gee ! ' This was right . This was just the best of luck . Ethel and Jack were here . ' Say , ' Myron asked , ' where 'd dey put you ? ' ' In dat dormitory over dere . ' ' I 'm in Merritt Lodge . We got rooms , you know . Four fellas in a room . Say  --  one of dem 's just been kicked out . He 's leavin tomorrow . Maybe I can get you in dere . ' ' Dat 'd be great . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made themselves comfortable on some steps . ' What was he fired for ? ' Jack asked . ' Makin a baby . He 's one of dese Eastern Inyans . Dey 're sure tough . And dis place ' Myron looked around . ' It 's a good school , but it 's crazy . You can talk Inyan all you want to . And de boys and girls go round togedder . Like dat . ' He nodded towards a sauntering couple . ' So dis girl , a Tewa  --  Ana Shashi , you know  --  she had a baby . ' ' Dey loosened up at Yellow Earth , too , ' Jack said . Only you got to be careful . And de grub sure got good . A lot of tings changed since you left . We got advisors and all like dat . ' ' Same here . De grub is swell . Only  --  de girls  --  dey ought n't to let dat happen . ' Keepin dem apart never did no good . You remember ? Dere was two at Yellow Earth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' doubtfully . ' But dis is a funny place . Dey 'll give you lessons on how to be an Inyan . Weavin and silversmittin , and paintin kinda Inyan-style pictures instead o ' copyin regular white ones de way we used to do . ' ' Sounds goofy , ' Jack said . ' Can dey sell de stuff ? ' ' Yeah , dey sell some of it . ' ' Den it ai n't so goofy . And dem pictures in de dinin-room , dey 're keen ! '  |p203Myron  frowned . The dining-room walls had been covered by Indian painters with heroic-sized murals out of their tribal life and ceremonies , Hopi , Keres , Tewa , Taos , Navajo , Kiowa ... There was even a sand-painting from the Night Chant there . Mr. Rensselaer said it just encouraged them to backslide . ' You still got your medicine bag ? ' he asked . ' Yeah . You bet . ' No use trying to explain , then . Jack was jack . ' Where were you dis summer ? ' Jack asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you said you might be comin home . ' ' I went to stay wit Jerome McCarty  --  Hasteen Tlipai . You know , de Inyan preacher . ' Jack grunted . ' I learned a lot . I 'm goin to be a preacher , and den I 'm goin to get on de Council . ' ' You 'll never get onto de Council if you 're a Christian . ' ' Did n't you ever hear of Jake Morgan ? ' ' What 's his Inyan name ? ' ' I du n no . He runs a mission near Shiprock . He 's on de Council . He 's one of de strongest men dey 've got . He 's educated , and de white men ca n't fool him . ' ' Maybe so . But when de white men wanta do someting , dey 'll just go ahead and do it . ' Myron was startled . ' I tought you were goin to school , like Ethel and me , just so 's to be able to stand up to dem . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can . But sometimes I tink de best ting is just to live on Black Mesa and be Navajo . ' ' Maybe . Did you see my uncle ? ' Jack had seen him once . They discussed reservation news for a while , then Myron rose , saying , ' Let 's see if we can find Ethel . ' They located her finally , standing with some other girls newly transferred from Keams Canyon . She was bashful and her handshake was limp , but Myron thought she was gladp204to see him . He wanted to stare at her , but prevented himself . She was changed . It was n't just the American dress , but her face had changed , her breasts were high under the cotton print , she had ceased to be a little girl . She looked neat and smart and bright . He and Jack drifted on , and he began to tell about the football team . He felt excitement in the middle of himself . Something exactly right was coming true . After supper he found Ethel again . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Are you scared of someting ? ' he asked . ' You do n't have to be scared . You ai n't used to a big school like dis . I 'll take care o ' you . ' She blushed slightly . ' Yeah , it 's big . And  --  and so many different kinds of Inyans . And den  --  I never talked to a boy before , not at school . Are you sure dey wo n't do someting to us ? ' ' Sure . Did n't dey change tings at Keams Canyon ? ' ' No . I heard dem talkin about de new orders . Dey said it would n't last , it was just dis Commissioner we got now . So dey did n't do nuttin about it . ' ' Maybe dey 're right . ' Myron pondered . ' Yeah , I guess dat 's right . It wo n't last . Seems like he ai n't Christian . Dey 'll have you studyin weavin . ' ' Dey said  --  Miss Allenby , I heard her say  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she said . ' ' Communist . Dat ai n't a religion , it 's a  --  a Russian idea to  --  to kinda turn everyting upside down . The Communists want to take down de flag and make us into Russians . I do n't see how one of dem could get to be Commissioner . He 's got ta be a Republican . ' ' Well , dat 's just what I heard Miss Allenby say . She do n't know so much ; she 's de intermediate grade teacher and she 's kinda dumb . ' She looked at Myron admiringly . ' I guess you know about dem tings . ' ' Yeah . I 'm studyin up on dem . It 's part of what youp2O5gotta know if you want to be a real , useful citizen . ' The way she listened to him was warming . ' Gee , I 'm glad you 're here . ' I 'm glad to be here , I guess . I feel  --  I feel kinda strange . It 's sure different . All dese buildins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good school , I guess . ' ' Sure it 's a good school . Dere 's some funny tings go on here , you got ta watch your step , but it 's a good school . It 's about de best . ' There seemed to be nothing else to say . After a while Myron remarked , ' Well , I 'll be seem you , ' and left her . He felt actively happy as he walked through the cool twilightto Merritt Lodge . The next thing was to get jack moved into his room . Don would leave tomorrow . Don was sitting on his bed , humming an Arapaho song and tapping a pencil on a book in time to it . ' Hello , big boy ! ' he said , ' I ai n't goin to be fired ! ' Hunh ? ' ' I went and saw Mr. Cowring , and Mr. Rensselaer stood up for me . They 're goin to give me another chance . Boy ! ' Myron said , ' Good . Dat 's fine . ' He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goin to behave myself . It ai n't so hard ; we start trainin tomorrer and after that comes basketball , and then pole vaultin . When I go back to Oklahoma , I 'll have me some fun . ' Myron nodded . ' You sure did me a good turn , big boy . It was me comin along voluntary that done it . Yeah , you did me a favour . ' Myron nodded again . Now jack could n't room with him . Suddenly it struck him that the net result of so much effort was just about nothing . His own emotion seemed a little ridiculous . He remembered how Miss Liter 's eyes bugged out , and Mr. Rensselaer 's expression , when Agapito dissolved the whole thing . At the time it had n't occurred to him that they were funny . Himself too , probably . Well , if Don stayed here and behaved himself , he might straighten out altogether , and that was the main thing.  | JACK handled the file delicately . The beauty of cast silver is its smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he glanced at the photograph of the old buckle he was copying . Four other boys stood at the long bench . Their hammers pounded a lively noise , now and then someone made a remark . It was fun to work with a bunch like this . Woodrow Wilson , the Navajo shop instructor , came and examined Jack 's work . ' Dat 's all right , ' he said , ' only you got ta smood dem edges a little more . ' ' I do n't wanta get it all scratched up . ' ' Use de stone and take your time . My fadder always said take lots o ' time . " Hajogo , hajogo , " he always said . A good job is fulla time . You can put it up for sale when you finish it . ' ' I guess I 'll keep it myself . ' ' All right . You got credit comin to you . Dat 's a dollar and four bits wort o ' silver . ' ' Okay . ' He polished carefully and steadily with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meant to be good and he 'd taken care all the way along . Figuring out new designs was no use ; no matter how hard he figured , he always ended by making the same old bracelet , but this picture , it was keen . American Indian Welfare Association was printed across the top . They were a smart bunch , he guessed . They seemed to take a lot of trouble over the Indians , he wondered what they got out of it . He compared buckle and picture again . Ethel ought to be tickled.  |p207Once  again he went through the emotion of deciding to stay over the summer . He 'd promised , but from time to time he just plain wanted to go home , and then saw that staying was right . That 's Myron . He can talk you into just about anything . He thinks of so many things , and he knows just how to say them . Next spring we graduate , and there 's a lot to learn during the summer . Just this once , and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle country and the big cornfield , his father and mother and uncle , and Buckskin Man and Singing Beads all seeing it the same way , and Ethel , Abinah Bitsi . She looks so well in Navajo clothes . If I make enough money , next year I 'll fix her up a silver necklace , like that one Philip 's making . Her people are n't so poor as they used to be , but not much jewelry . Abinah Bitsi . Teez Nantai Big . She 'll have to come back another year or two after I 'm through . Myron 's going to stay on . Myron  --  he would n't do that  --  but he does pay a lot of attention to her . The buckle was about finished . He test d the set of the turquoise in its centre  --  firm enough . He looked at the picture of the antique original . A good job . He held it out towards Woodrow . The instructor turned it over carefully , felt it , hefted it . ' Okay . It 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yahte lan . ' Jack felt glad . He could make a thing like this and give it to Ethel , even if he could n't talk or stand out in the school the way Myron did . He caught up with her as they were leaving the dining hall . ' Let 's take a walk , ' he said . ' I got sometin for you . ' ' All right . ' Spring had been absorbed into summer . The level sunlight came between the buildings and splashed on the big trees . Shade was pleasant . They went past the Senior Girls ' Dormitoryto where chamisa and greasewood grew tall along the ditch . Standing among the bushes , one felt private.  |p208Ethel  pinched off a leaf and looked at it . ' It 's pretty here , but I 'd be glad to smell  --  what you call it  --  ts'ah again . ' ' I 'm stayin here dis summer , ' Jack said . ' You 're stayin ? ' ' Yeah . I told Myron . ' ' You kinda like to do what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He tinks harder dan we do . When I graduate , I ai n't comin back . I 'll know what I got to know , and dere 's plenty to do back home . So I guess I 'll learn some more dis summer , and make a lotta jewelry and sell it , and get some more money . ' ' Your folks  --  what 'll dey say ? ' ' Dey can get on all right . I 'm sendin dem a letter . I tought you could take it and read it to dem . ' ' I ai n't goin home ' ' You ai n't ? ' ' No . A girl ca n't bum her way like a boy can . You know how it is . A coupla years ago dey took you all pretty close to home , now dey 've kinda forgotten about it again . Most of de Hopi girls and us are stayin here , unless deir folks can meet dem at Winslow . ' ' Yeah . Dat 's right . ' ' Well , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . You ai n't goin on after you graduate ? ' ' No . Dat 's all right for Myron . He 's only kinda half Inyan Jack hesitated . ' He 's all right , you know , only he 's different . He 's smart . Like de debatin prize and de way he talks English . I ai n't goin to mix up wit white men and Washington and all dat . Only we want to know enough so dat if any white men mix up wit us , dey ca n't fool us . Tlichisenili'ssafe ; dey ca n't do it dere like dey done out where you folks used to be . ' ' Yeah . Only you wo n't always stay at Tlichisenili . ' He understood her . When he married he 'd go to his wife 's place . ' I got dis for you . I made it . ' He pulled out the silver andp209turquoise buckle . ' It 's good . It 's a copy of an old-time one . You can fix it on some kind of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in her fingers . ' It 's pretty . ' She slipped it in the pocket of her skirt . Her hand remained just above the pocket . Jack linked fingers through it . She did n't move . English was inadequate , he dropped into their own tongue . ' If I do well this summer and next winter , I 'll make you a belt to go with it , the big placques . ' They stood for several minutes , looking at their joined hands through which so much was passing . The sun had gone behind the Jemez Mountains . ' Then when you do go home and put on your own clothes , you can wear it and it will be handsome . ' ' Yes . ' Another pause , crowded full , smooth-flowing . ' It 's so good in that valley , ' he said . ' Our parents have thought about us , I think . ' There was a light in her face , curious , the set of her features and her eyelids sleepy , and yet her face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved together . His other arm went around her and they were kissing . He felt as if he had turned to weightless fluid , he felt sanctified . She was trembling . Two people , white men , spoke on the path beyond the bushes . They separated and stood still until the men had passed . ' We 'd better go in now , I think , ' she said . ' Yes . ' They walked hand in hand until they were close to where other students idled and talked before the building . ' Tanks for de buckle , I 'll wear it , ' Ethel said . ' All right . I wish we was bot goin home . Only  --  well I promised him . And  --  I du n no . ' ' He 's right . You 're plenty smart , and we want to do just right . Listen  --  do n't talk to him about us. '  |p210Jack  asked sharply , ' Why not ? You ain'tNo . Only he has funny ideas . You know . ' Yeah . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Girls ' Dormitory . Too bad those men came along , he thought , they broke into it . I 'd like  --  well , I do n't want to make a baby on her . The teachers would fuss and holler , and Myron  --  Jack almost giggled . They say it 's bad for a girl , having a baby at sixteen . I du n no . If she had a baby we 'd get married right off and stop all this bother . School 's a lot of work . Fun , too . He heard the slap of hands catching a football , and looked to see White Elk holding it . The thought of fall reaching into the end of spring . Myron stood with his back to him . Stepping forward lightly on his toes , he was in time to intercept the return pass with a whoop , and began to run . White Elk tackled him . ' Come on , ' he said as he got up . ' Let 's play touch-tackle before it gets too dark . ' Okay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ' Nuttin . I just feel good . '  | JUNIPER walked in a wide , slow circle around her flock . The animals grazed in a scattered formation , requiring little attention , the two dogs lazed under bushes . The whole country , the rocks , the trees , lay under the sleepinessof late afternoon , but she was restless . It was entirely reasonable for her father and mother to decide to bring a second wife into the hogahn , but the idea upset her . It brought things to a head , somehow . Her cousin , Red Woman'sniece , was her own age . She liked the girl . Her mother was through with having children and all that , there was a lot of work to be done , her brothers had married and moved away , and she herself had brought no son-in-law to replace them . But she did not want to live in the same enclosure with her cousin on those terms . She looked up the canyon . No sign of a rider in its wide stretch . He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheep he 'd turn aside for a word with her away from her parents , not pressing , not indecorous , but letting her know . Singing Gambler . He said he was changing his name , he said he had grown out of the childish stage of eternal playing . She knew in advance how his voice would sound as he rode towards her , how he would smile , and how he would turn in the saddle , looking down at her . What held her back ? Ever since she first saw him in Returning Wisely 's hogahn she had liked him , but then the storm brought Big Salt 's Son and she lost the trail . Big Salt 's Son ; he had become unreal , but she could remember the shame of his shame , and the long ache of waiting . Singing Gambler knew himself . A remainderp2I2of disbelief , a fear of finality , a waiting for her inmost voice to say yes . Just as she had foreseen it , his song reached her and he came loping . Just so the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She wished she were wearing a blanket , to pull it across her face . ' How hot it is , ' he said . ' But now I am refreshed . ' No one else said things like that . ' I 'm glad you came . ' He was a man who had had pleasure with many girls , a man who could pick and choose if he wished . Yet her simple remark made his face light up . ' You know , ' he said , ' I keep coming and coming here . I think sometimes , perhaps you see too much of me . But I know that what I really want is here . ' He was grave now . How clear his face was . The strength of his feeling and its sweetness reached her fully . Yes , oh surely yes . ' I do n't see too much of you . ' ' Why pretend ? ' he said . ' I want to speak to your parents about it , if you are willing . I want to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice sounded faint . She wished she had a blanket to pull over her face , and she wanted him to come down off that horse and touch her . He dismounted in one quick flash of movement , and now she was completely sure . Bay Horse 's Son-in-Law stopped and mopped his brow . The old man at the other end of the field hoed steadily , slowly , pausing seldom . He got a lot done in a day . Corn is hard work . At least , you do n't have to keep at it all the time , but the hoe gets heavy . Sometimes the Son-in-Law worked furiously , sometimes he dawdled , at other times he was steady . It was comical , Bay Horse 's new wife and juniper had theirp213babies almost together , and that mite was his son 's uncle . The thought of his baby , Warrior Comes Forth , encouraged him with the hoe . The old man  --  not so awfully old , but still , about fifty  --  went right on making progress along his row . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope I 'll last like that . And with juniper . I do n't see how you could want anyone else when you have juniper . Will she grow old ? He thought of girls he 'd had before his name was changed , the wide travel and the fun without tomorrows . I made some babies , but now I 've got Warrior Comes Forth . Eh ! I 'm not that wanderer any more . No gambling all summer . Next fall we 'll have some fun , when the hiding-stick games start again . The hoe stays heavy . He began to think of a song about how heavy a hoe is , he kept working on it until it came out . He hummed it to himself and grinned . When their work brought them together , Bay Horse paused with a sigh . ' What 's that song you 're humming ? ' he asked . ' I just made it . ' His son-in-law straightened up and stretched . Sing it . ' A-a-a-a ai-ya ai-na a-a-a-a ai-na , When my son is grown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me. a-a-a-a ai-na . Bay Horse laughed . ' Better pray for a daughter . Your son will marry and move away . One needs a son-in-law . ' ' Give me time . ' They worked their way to the opposite ends of the field . Bay Horse 's Son-in-Law saw a man coming up the valley . He was riding a black horse , loping , and singing a song about ' The white man plants potatoes , Then he plants old clothesp214to guard them . ' The young farmer sighed . A year ago that was himself , loping along the canyon . He watched the rider draw near , and recognized Travels Around . Travels Around turned aside and came to the cornfield , calling a greeting and holding his horse back from trying to eat the green shoots . Bay Horse 's Son-in-Law came out to him . ' What are you doing ? ' Travels Around asked . ' Ripening . All sorts of ripening . ' Travels Around looked puzzled . ' That 's what the Winter People call us , ' he explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Travels Around grinned . ' I heard you had a crop . ' ' Yes . About fifteen days ago . ' ' How do you like this life , settled down and hoeing corn ? ' ' It 's good . It 's very good . ' ' If you like it , it must be good . The Ripeners  --  have you been to the Winter People ? ' ' Yes . Years ago . I was there about three months . ' ' What are they like ? I 've been to a lot of places , but I never went there . ' ' You ought to go . You can have a lot of fun . They have fine horses , and they 'll pay you twenty dollars a month and feed you , to herd their sheep for them . It 's easy herding , too , the grass is good all over . They gamble a lot . They have a game with four white bones that you hide , you can play it in summer , they have our games , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are n't good at it , and any Navajo who can sing is welcome among them . You know , none of the Apaches can lift their voices the way we do . ' ' Yes . The Chishi sing heavily . I 've been down there . ' ' Yes , it 's the same thing . ' ' But  --  one hears that they 're dangerous . ' ' No . They 're good people , except when they get drunk . When they 're drunk , one wants to step aside . ' Bay Horse had come up and was listening . ' Is it true they talk like us ? ' he asked  | ' Almost the same , only they twist it a little . They say doya for dota , and nijoni when they really mean yahti , and things like that . But you understand them all right . ' ' Do they drink much ? ' Travels Around asked . ' Whenever they feel like it . They make t'o tlipai , you know , like the Chishi , and they live near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . ' ' All of them ! ' Bay Horse exclaimed . ' Yes . They get together for something , and the Mexicans come with whiskey , and the men and the women all get drunk . Then they mix up with each other 's wives , and they fight , and that 's when you want to step aside . If they knock you down , they jump on you . ' ' They sound like people to stay away from altogether . They were always warlike . ' ' They 're good people . They treat you well . You can make money there , both working and playing . ' ' Do they like Navajos ? ' ' Pretty well . Only they think we 're thieves . Whenever something is stolen , they go after the Navajos . ' ' Do they catch them ? ' Travels Around asked . Bay Horse 's Son-in-Law grinned . ' Generally not . ' They talked a little longer about the Apache tribes , Bay Horse recalling the tradition of how the Navajos broke off from the Winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Travels Around left them . As they walked home , Bay Horse said , ' You talked as if you had a good time when you went over there . ' ' Yes . I  --  you know , I 'd forgotten about it . Then when I was talking it all came back to me . It was fun . ' He went on alone to his own hogahn . Yes , he felt shut in , but at the sight of juniper by the fire , the baby on her lap , the feeling vanished . She smiled when she saw him . He held the baby while she finished cooking . His own child , how wonderful ! He playedp216with it , marvelling at its unco-ordinated , futile motions and the perfection of its almond-shaped , black eyes . He sang his new song and told her of Bay Horse 's answer . She laughed at him . ' A daughter next , let us hope , ' she said . ' You 're only one son-in-law replacing three sons . Daughters are better . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke about seeing Travels Around . She put the child in its cradleboard when she had fed it , and then lay close by him , listening and watching the play of his expressions . He got going on the Winter People , telling about the country of grass and tall trees and lakes , about their tipis and their horses , about the great autumn assembly when all the tribe camped together and Indians came visiting from everywhere , Navajos , Utes , Jemez , Zias , Tewas , Keres , Taos  --  the great gathering , singing all night , feasting and playing all day . She commented as she might on any interesting subject , but she did n't like it . She wondered if there had been Apache women  --  but that was n't the main thing . It was the memory of his past existence shining in his eyes . The wanderer . Would it pull too hard one day ? She said , ' I 'd like to go there with you sometime . ' He beamed . ' Eh ! We could have fun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He told her more about it . ' Going there with you  --  that would be different . Like putting salt on something . It would be good . ' He laid a hand on her shoulder , and leaning his head back against his rolled blanket , sang a love song . It was all part of the same man , it all put together to make him . The rest was up to her . So far , it was all right.  | WHEN the coach called to jack and he started running back and forth , warming up , Ethel felt her heart pound . Now they would both be in there . She felt that something was going to happen , she felt important . At times , recently , she had wished that the three of them could be united as they had been , with jack still loyally enjoying Myron 's prominence , but if she had had the chance now to end the competition between them , she would probably not have chosen to do so . Jack went in at left halfback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ankle . It was the beginning of the second half , and he was the first substitute in the backfield ; the game was too hot to use second-string men unless absolutelynecessary . Albuquerque had n't scored yet , but had kept the ball in Santa Fe 's territory right along , and on the last few plays their big Apache fullback had been running wild through the line . Margarito Hernandez , the quarterback and captain , slapped him between the shoulder blades . ' Come on , break ' em up . ' Mindful of the referee , jack made no answer . He , Margarito , and Myron took their places behind the line , with White Elk farther back . Albuquerque was using straight plunges and so centre played close behind the guards . They sent the play at jack 's side , of course , with Santa Fe 's left tackle sprawling helpless , but he was right in there and spilled the interference with a driving dive . Myron came over the pile  --  Margarito wondered how he got there so fast  --  and hit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the field ,  |p218Albuquerque  lost six inches . They disentangled themselves , players patting the two halfbacks on their shoulders , but Myron and Jack did n't look at each other . The stands were yelling . On the next play Albuquerque gained one yard , fourth down and four to go on Santa Fe 's twenty-yard line . The Santa Fe line went into formation with a new snap . Margarito called , ' Thirty-two , eight . ' He expected a drop-kick . Out of the side of his mouth , Myron said to jack , ' All right . Break it up . ' Jack did n't answer . The two Navajos broke through simultaneously . Two men took jack out , but on Myron 's side the quarterback was busy with right end . He saw the kicker just letting the ball fall , and went through the air in two long bounds . Hurried , the kick went wild over the line , and it was Santa Fe 's ball . Margarito sent Myron between guard and tackle from kick formation with White Elk standing back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expect to gain much , but it was n't what Albuquerque was looking for . Jack 's drive ahead of Myron partly did it , that and the way Myron span and fought when jack was down . Three men stopped him for a five-yard gain . The quarterback saw that something was indeed happening . Tease had never played like this before . The two Navajos were on fire . They seemed to ignore each other , but they were playing together . He tried the same play again and Albuquerque'smountainous Havasupai guard stopped it dead . As they rose , Myron and Jack looked at each other without a word , their eyes seeming to snarl . They needed to be farther from their own goal line . Margaritocalled for a kick from the same formation . Don White Elk got it off fast . The ends became tangled with the Albuquerquedefence , and jack and Myron were racing down under a high , slow , straight , end-over-end punt . The safety manp219saw them coming , he got a look at their faces and signalled for a fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul and waited , arms outspread and faces tense , in case he should drop the ball or take too many steps . He did n't . Each of them had been going to hit that Apache so hard they 'd jar his teeth loose . They 'd been going to make a fumble . They looked at each other while the team came up , the snarling momentarily forgotten . ' Next time , ' Myron said , half to Jack , half to the fullback . Jack grunted . The Apache said , ' Nuts . ' Albuquerque could n't gain ground . The Apache made an earnest attempt to break jack 's ankle in a scrimmage , but Myron stepped on his face . They were always working together , they did n't seem to pay any attention to each other , did n't speak , but where one was the other turned up and joined in . Albuquerque kicked and Santa Fe started down the field with steady rushes . Margarito did n't know what had got into Jack and Myron , and he did n't take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a noble scrapper himself . If the two Wan Sabis were inspired to win the final game for him , that suited him . He watched them , to see if their fire burned out or they began to go haywire . On Albuquerque 's thirty-eight-yard line they were momentarilystopped . Fourth down and two to go . Margarito hated to lose the ball , the way they were driving , yet two line plunges in succession had gained only half a yard . Well , it was safe territory for the trick pass , and that would bring in the Begay-Tease combination again . He looked at the two of them as he called the play . They 'd do . Don pretended to be going around the short end with the ball , Margarito 's and jack 's drive at the other end looked like part of the fake . Then Jack wriggled through to an open place behind the opposing line . It all had to be quick as shooting . Everyone had expected a kick or another plunge . Thep22Ostands held their breath . Myron standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsure what to do with it , unutterably calm save for the clamped line of his mouth , seemed to tower above the field . Two men were closing in on him . His arm moved swiftly , suddenly , a perfect pass , straight and hard , but not too hard , high to avoid interception , but possible for a top-notch player to catch handily , placed exactly over Jack 's left shoulder . Jack rose in the air , caught the ball , and came down running to gain another two yards for a total of six , before he was downed . The stands went wild . He 'd handled the same play before with Sinemptiwa , but differently . He usually lobbed the pass , slower , easier to intercept , putting less strain on the catcher , but this time he had given it vicious perfection . He and Jack were impassive as their team-mates slapped their backs . The two sides jumped back into line , the march continued . Fourteen to nothing . The field between the stands was dusky , the west @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joking , laughing , boastful , towards the buildings . The Albuquerque boys and girls climbed into their busses . The tension , the excitement broke up , and it was Saturday evening again . Walking towards his room , Myron felt washed , bruised , and unhappy . Jack had been good . Jack  --  if one could make peace , but there was Ethel . He dragged up the stairs and sat on his bed , staring at the wall in a black , profound depression . Finally he decided to go and eat supper . After supper he went back up to his room , having no heart for the sociable in the community building . Half an hour later , Don came in , with a newspaper under his arm . ' Hyah , big boy ! ' he said . His cheerfulness was grating . Myron grunted . The Arapaho sat down beside him . What'sa matter ? Gettin the letdown , hunh ? ' Receiving no answer he went on :  |p221'Cheer  up . Boy , you were good , and I do n't mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're the school hero . ' ' Jack 's de hero , ' Myron said . ' He was good , too , but you were the works . Do n't let it get you down . ' ' I feel sorta funny . I do n't feel right . ' ' Here , take a look at this newspaper . ' Don handed it to him , open at the sports page . His name was in the headlines , in the opening lead , and he had a paragraph to himself . Jack was mentioned , so was Don , but he was featured . ' You better go to college , feller , ' Don said . ' Lots of schools would give you scholarships . ' Myron said , ' Well , it was luck . Margie gave me de ball to go over de line . ' He looked at the paper again . ' Jack  --  you know what he did . Dey ought a have ' What do you keep worryin about him for ? I know you used to be buddies , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He ai n't a hick . He 's a good Navajo . ' Myron fell silent . He did n't know how to explain . Finally he said ' Aw , nuts . ' He was sick of this . He grabbed his hat and went out . He felt a little better in the dark . Music came across the campus from the community building . He drifted towards it . Ethel was in there , she would be expecting him , wondering why he did n't turn up . He stood just outside the door , with his hands in his pockets . Through the window he caught glimpses of couples turning . It seemed as if somehow he 'd forgotten about her since the game , and he 'd been thinking only about Jack . That had been settled , ended , more than a month ago ; they both understood , as if they 'd explained it to each other . It came over him that he really had been the star of the big game , and Ethel was inside there , and he thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at last , she would be his girl and stop hanging in between . He walked up the steps and turned in at the door of the big room , stopping a moment at the threshold . Some couplesp222turned on the floor while the Victor played , boys and girls stood or sat about , a few read magazines . The Girls ' Advisor and two teachers chatted in the corner . There was Ethel in a group , and Jack standing on the outside of it , watching her . He looked at her for a minute , as if he saw her more clearly while she did n't know he was there , feeling the sense of her presence , then he crossed the room . She was pleased and faintly flustered when he came up , her colour mounted . Jack looked sullen . The others in the group showed a flattering awareness of him , the big man , the top man of that day . Across the room , a boy raised his two hands , joined , and shook them towards him ; one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was great work , Myron . ' Assurance mounted in him . He said to Ethel , ' Hello . Let 's dance . ' ' All right . ' His right hand felt her back , his left hand locked her right ; as they stepped , their bodies touched lightly . He was dancing with Ethel , she was the girl for him , meant for him , ever since that early time . Beside her no one else was important . Jack had sat down in a corner and was reading a magazine . ' I want to talk to you , ' Myron said . ' Let 's slip out . ' ' We  --  dey might notice . ' ' Come on . We can just step out de door . ' ' All right . ' It was cold outside , but helpfully dark . When he took her hand , he felt a tremble run through her . He made two false starts at speaking , then his words came easily . ' I 've been watchin you ever since I first knew you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . You are n't like all de odders . You 're like me , you 're goin somewhere . I been watchin and watchin you . Gee , Ethel , all dis summer , all dis past year , I been wantin to get to you . You 're my girl , see ? I want you to be my girl , and stick wit me . I 'm goin to take care of you and help you , and when we bot get trough we 'll live civilized . ' ' I  --  I du n no . My folks  |p223'You  do n't have to bodder about your folks when I 'm around . You are n't goin to need sheep or any of dem tings wit me . ' It was Myron talking and she believed him . Jack seemed commonplace . Myron was adventure , conquest , he surrounded her entirely and cut off anything else . She held to his hand , waiting . He kissed her , first on the forehead , then on the cheek . She put her head down against his neck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against him , her warmth . He wanted to shout . She was inactive in his arms , not like that other one . She was a good girl . He wanted everything to be the very best . There would be no wrong , and in the end a marriage . Marriage . He put his face down and found the corner of her lips . Then her arms really took hold of him . It was cold , they both began to be chilled . They went in together and danced back to the centre of the room . When the record ended , they joined a talking group by the fireplace , making a point of moving slightly away from each other . Jack put down his magazine and went straight to Ethel . Almost at the same moment , the Girls ' Advisor said it was bedtime . Myron left immediately . He did n't want to talk to Jack . If he had to fight him he would , but he hoped he would n't have to do that . He was entering Merritt Lodge before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was his . She had a silver buckle jack had made her . He 'd give her Singing Gambler 's bracelet . Gee , it was fixed ! She was his girl , she loved him . He 'd kissed her . Gee ! Now if he could straighten it out with jack , but anyhow Oh , Gee !  | HE WAS tired of Santa Fe just then , tired of having a career and a calling . He 'd flunked algebra again , and he still had a long way to go before he could take the College Boards in French and European History . He thought he 'd like to go right out on the reservation , clear to Ha'anoichi , and forget about it all for a summer . People expected so much of him . Another year of Santa Fe , tutoring with Mr. Rensselaer and all that , and no one his own age left in school . If only you did n't have to know so many subjects to get a scholarship . He 'd told Mr. Rensselaer he wanted to go home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now he felt angry , he had half a mind to go home anyhow . With Ethel leaving  --  would she wait for him ? At least she was n't going to Tlichisenili , that was some comfort . He 'd get to see her later this summer , when he went to stay with Mr. Butler . But from Ha'anoichi he could ride over there any time , it was only about two days . Drifting along on horseback , watching the country and worrying about nothing . How would he be on horseback now ? Could he still ride ? Jack told him , before he left last spring , that he was n't an Indian any longer . But I am an Indian . I 'm going to go to college and be ordained , and I 'm an Indian . I 'm going to be the first regular Navajo clergyman . And bring it to my people . The Navajos can be anything in the world , we can be everything white men are , just like white men . So long as that which stands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Singer 's phrase . He nodded . With that , we can be anything.  |p225If  he could talk to jack , now that a year had gone by , could he make him understand ? Ethel was Christian . Right from the start , from that letter , she 'd been meant for him . Would jack see ? He 'd give a lot to get past the stony face that jack had given him . Mr. Rensselaer and Mr. Butler wanted him to keep on working until he got his scholarship . He was old now for entering college , they said . Well , it is n't just fun being a Christian . It 's something big ; you 've got to put it first and lose other things for it . He who loses his life shall find it . That 's right . One way or another , he 'd have had to break with a heathen like jack some time . But he wishedHe turned into the school grounds . It is n't what you want to do , but what you have to do . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . My duty is to stay here . It 's a long climb , but even Jerome McCarty has n't been ordained . She was loitering behind the fine arts building . When he saw her looking at him , he knew what she hoped for , and felt defeated for a moment . But this was the way it had to be . For her , too , to be worthy of her . ' Mr. Rensselaer tinks I ought to stay here , on account of tutorin , ' he said . ' Oh . Dat 's too bad . ' ' Well , I guess he 's right . I 'll be twenty-two next year , and dat 's old for goin to college . I ca n't lose any more time . But I 'm sorry . ' ' It 's goin to be kinda lonely at dat mission . ' ' Dey 're good people . I went out to Gideon last year . ' ' Yeah . But I do n't know dem . ' She looked around the campus and then at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while I 'm stayin wit Mr. Butler . I 'll see you den , sure . ' ' Dat 's good , ' she said . ' Let 's walk . ' They strolled side by side . ' You see , ' he explained , ' Mr. Rensselaer , he 's givin me a kinda junior college course . While I 'm makin up for desep226exams , I 'm goin ahead , too , so I can graduate soon . Den dey 'll ordain me . ' ' It seems funny , ' she said , ' an Inyan bein a regular preacher . ' ' Why not ? Odder tribes have done it . Den dey 'll give us a mission , like I told you . We 'll have a regular house wit a kitchen and books , and  --  and a lamp on de table , and everytin . ' ' Yeah . Dat beats a hogahn . I 've been sleepin in beds too long . ' They walked several steps before Myron answered . ' Sleepin on de ground 's all right . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just de house , de comforts . It 's de work we 've got to do . De work  --  you and me , we know . We can show our people . Like de speech Doctor Entwistle made yesterday , you young people who are graduatin are goin back to make de futures of your tribes . Only most of dem  --  you know  --  eider dey go back to de blanket , or all dey figure on is how to buy a car and drive around in it . But we know . We were picked out , way back . ' ' Gideon 's awful far from home , ' she said . ' I 'd like to see my folks . ' ' Are n't you goin to visit dem first ? ' ' I 'm goin to de mission , and den on to Tlichisenili for a week , dat 's all . I 'd like to be where dey could kinda come around when dey felt like it . ' Myron started to speak , paused , then said , ' Well , dere is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tlichisenili . ' They had reached the sheltering bushes along the ditch , and now stood facing each other . ' Why do n't you come out to Gideon and study wit Mr. Boyle dis summer ? Why ca n't you do dat ? ' ' Dat 's a good idea ! Say --  ' His face clouded . ' Gee  --  Mr. Rensselaer would want to know why . He would n't see it . And den  --  Mr. Boyle never went to college . I do n't know if he 's got de education . ' He felt as if he were pumping uphill . ' But it 's a good idea . I 'll try it . I 'll be out dere for some of de time , anyhow . '  |p227He  took her hand . The afternoon sun was strong , it was hot even there in the shade . Their fingers felt sticky and slippery against each other . She was wearing the bracelet he 'd given her . ' I wish we could do de way we like , ' he said . ' I wish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like we did last summer . But I got to get into college . Dat 's de real , main ting . So it 's got to be dis way , I guess . ' ' Yeah . I guess so . ' He longed for some different response from her , this last afternoon . Something to lift him up . ' Dey were nice , dose picnics , were n't dey ? ' ' Yeah . ' ' When we 're married , we can go on dem any time we want to . ' ' You ca n't sing no Inyan songs when you 're a preacher , nor no jazz . Only hymns . ' Myron frowned . ' Sure I 'll sing dem . I do n't care what dey say , if you like dem , I 'll sing dem . ' The quality of her touch changed slightly . ' You ai n't scared to say dat ? ' ' No . I mean it . ' She looked pleased . He kissed her , several times on her cheek , her forehead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed the way he felt . He lost the nagging sense of failing , and knew that she was his . ' I 'd like to marry you right now , ' he said . ' We 're old enough . Only den dey would n't let me into college . But I 'd like to . ' Their warmths penetrated their summer clothing , against each other . Now her arm was really tight against his side and back . ' Oh Ethel . Aiyanoshne . Aigisi aiyanoshne. je aime vous . Dat 's de French for it . Dere are n't enough languages to say it in . ' She turned her face up to his again and they really kissed . The big bell ringing startled them . ' Supper , ' he said . ' Too soon . I 'll see you again afterward ? '  |p228Yess  . ' They kissed again , then started back to school . ' When you go home , you  --  you 'll be seein jack ? ' ' Him ? I guess he 's married by now . ' On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play that fall . Albuquerque and St. Francis both protested against keeping the two grown men on the team . The genuineness of Myron 's continued study could be easily proven , but the Sioux was taking the same art course for the fourth time , although his paintings already sold well , and he was always free to keep commercial dancing engagements . Football and basketball seemed to be his only real school activities . As a result , Myron was barred , too . Circling Bull departed for home , wearing a natty , doublebreastedsuit for which he had not finished paying , and carryingtwo big suitcases which contained among other things artist 's supplies , a quart of rye whiskey , two dance costumes , two silver cups , ten silver and bronze medals , a package of red paint consecrated in Taos kiva , and four eagle breastfeathersfrom Acoma . Myron helped coach . He hated sitting on the sidelines during games , and used to feel blue afterward . All his old friends were gone , the students were beginning to look like a lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burying himself in them , and wrote long , carefully evolved letters to Ethel , treasuring her brief answers . College  --  graduation  --  and then the house with many rooms , and Ethel . Going forward together , the great work to be done . Nearer and brighter , next summer with examinations passed and scholarship assured , free to see all he wanted of her , and with that first achievement to show her . She 'd been glad to see him last August , though he 'd been able to manage only three weeks . The Boyles made muchp229of him . They were suspicious of letting him go out alone with her , but after he 'd talked to Mr. Boyle about his hopes and plans , the missionary had trusted him . And it had been all right , although sometimes it had been hard not to go too far . She was a good girl , that made it easier . She was n't very happy at the mission . Mrs. Boyle was cross , she said . She did n't see where she needed her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting her anywhere . Myron told her to be patient and stick it out , she was bound to learn a lot by living with people like the Boyles . But it made him angry that Mrs. Boyle should snap at Ethel , it was n't Christian of her . When he next saw Mr. Butler he 'd talk to him about it ; it was too hard to write about a thing like that . Often and often he thought of what it would be like to he married to her , remembering details of her voice and gesture , sometimes thinking in terms that made him ashamed . In prayer , he thanked God earnestly for enabling him to win her , asking for her protection and that Mrs. Boyle should he kind to her . In November she wrote that she was going to Tlichisenili . Her mother was sick , and there were her father and younger sister to be taken care of . It was a hasty letter . Buckskin Man had come to Gideon and was waiting . ' He has a horse for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to ride all that way . And I have not got no clothes for it . ' He wrote to her , rather hopelessly , in care of Tloh Chin Trading Post . Heaven knew when a letter would get there , or when or how it would be passed on to her . And even if she wrote to him , it might be any length of time coming . It might get lost . He prayed for her comfort in that hogahn , for her fortitude , and for those letters . December , Christmas , and January . If only just one letter would come , please God . Just one letter to say that she 's all right , and she is n't looking at jack . Jack was heathen . He was backward . He had turned away from the light . But he was Jack . Any girl could like him  --   |p230remembered  clearly , more than remembered , felt . A man to be afraid of . Maybe he 's married . Oh Lord , I hope he 's married . Make Ethel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been a month getting to him . He stuck it into his pocket as though he was afraid someone would see it , and went straight up to his room . By good luck , his roommates were not in . He opened it slowly , feeling his heart striking heavy blows against his ribs . The first wild surge of joy had settled into painful excitement . Written in pencil on two small sheets of ruled paper , her hand . Mr. Myron BegayU . S. Indian SchoolSanta Fe , New Mex . Dear Friend  --  I meant to write to you sooner , but it is hard to write here and I am very busy . My mother was sure sick . She is better now . I wanted them to take her to the hospittal but they had a sing instead . A Fire dance . It cost sixty sheep and two horses and a silver belt . So she got better anyhow . I have to stay a little longer , helping her . We got a big flock of sheeps now . I got one letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell people to ask when they goe to the Traders . I am well . I hope you are well . It is cold hear . Yours sincerelyETHELShe had n't mentioned Jack . She did n't even mention him . He 's married . He 's married and moved off . They had a sing . That 's what that religion does , when a person ought to go to the hospital , but it had n't fooled her . Paying all that for heathen medicine that could n't cure anyone . Ethel 's all right . She 's all right . She is n't thinking about Jack . He knelt down and prayed . God had been good to him . God reaches in , to Shooting Singer 's winter camp , to the grazing lands below Tlichisenili . It was up to him to be worthy . He drove at his work withp231different vigour . The relief of that letter eased his studies for long afterward . He hardly realized how much time had passed since that word from her . Spring arrived by surprise , the apricots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had n't noticed . And now there was the panic of approachingexaminations , the utter necessity of doing well , of getting all those different subjects exactly straight and pat in his head . Only at times , like Sunday afternoons , when he tried to relax , did he really know how much he wanted news of her again . He did n't even have the solace of writing to her ; it was impossible to go on sending letters into the void . Sometimes his learning buzzed in his brain . He was uneasy at work and frightened when he let up . Sometimes when he was studying , a girl 's voice or laughter outside sounded like Ethel , and he would start and then remember . The boys were kids , but the older girls seemed women . He avoided them . Only a short time now , a few weeks to the exams and then I can go out there , go out there . If jack 's hanging around , I 'll know what to do . If I pass  --  that blocked the run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . He turned back to his book and his notes . A boy and girl walked by outside , her stockingless legs were smooth and brown , her face a mystery . I 've got to pass . And then I 'll go right out there . I will pass.  |p232HE  LAY on his shoulder blades with his head proppedon his saddle and his crossed knees the loftiest partof his anatomy , tapping a stick against the bottom ofa frying-pan , trying to recall a song a visiting Taoshad sung . We ya-he ya we ya he yo-o ... It was a lovely , lightsong , and it went well with thinking about girls . As he lay , the long , white slope of the tipi rose within his vision , thelower part contrasting with dark green pines , the upper partwith blue sky . More in front of him he saw Painted Girldoing something about lunch . She wore a light-blue dresswith a square , orange yoke , and orange near the hem , and awide belt studded with brass , after the manner of the WinterPeople . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ribbon . We ya-he ya hai-ya . No , he could n't get it . Those Taos had a voice of their own , a sweet , far-carrying voice . They could n't sing Navajo and he could n't sing Taos . He remembered some of the words , and wondered what they meant . Something pleasant for a girl to hear , he thought . Painted Girl said suddenly : ' You ca n't do it . You have to live in an adobe house to sing that . ' He grinned at her . She was good fun . In many ways she was good fun . She was peeling potatoes . He sang , ' The white man plants potatoes . ' The Winter People live well . He went on to the Magpie Song , the Hello John Song , knowinghow she listened to him behind the shyness of those braids half hiding her face , the caution of her mother inside the tipi . He 'd started ' The hoe is heavy ' before he realized it , and stopped himself abruptly , still tapping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of another , and then of a Mountain Chant and you went on to that , and then you were so near the Winter People that it was silly not to go sce them . I must start for home pretty soon , he thought . Yes , very soon . She 'll be angry . Through the wide-spaced , tall pines before him he saw three men riding . The one in front was a blond white man ; it was Lean Face , who told the Indians what to do about their sheep . Lean Face was good fun , he could talk the Apache dialect pretty well , and he knew lots of songs . If he was inspecting around here , he might come back to Many Fights ' tipi this evening . In that case , they 'd play and sing . He was remarkably nice for a white man , almost like an Indian . Left Hand , the policeman , rode behind him . Left Hand was all right ; not an interesting person , but all right . Lean Face looked glum , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man focussed his attention . It was Brave Man , the policeman from Tees Napornss . Yes , it was . What was he doing way over here , a long week 's ride from his district ? Singing Gambler stopped drumming on the frying-pan . Here 's where I go home , he thought . Lean Face said , ' Tanjoh . ' He answered , ' Tanjoh , ' as though he 'd been born among the Winter People . Broad Woman came out of the tipi , saying , ' Tanjoh , tanjoh , come in , sit down . ' Lean Face said , ' We want to talk to this Ripener . ' Brave Man pushed his horse up front . ' You have corn to hoe , grandfather , ' he said . ' Your wife is tired of waiting for you . ' Painted Girl dropped a potato on the ground . She picked it up , wiped it on her skirt , and let it fall into the pan . Then she rose and walked into the tipi . Singing Gambler had risen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . His hard goods , his winnings , were in the tipi . All along he 'd counted on bringing them back to her . Now Painted Girl was in there . Lean Face said something in English.  | ' We can lunch here , he says , ' Brave Man interpreted . Many Fights would be coming back . ' If we 're going , let 's go , ' Singing Gambler said . ' My horse is right over there ' ; he made a decision . Those things were for Juniper . ' Just wait till I get my goods . ' She stood in the middle of the tipi , her hands hanging by her sides , still holding her knife . He knew these people , she might go for him ; he was n't afraid of that , but of her eyes , full of heavy fire . He was sorry , he did n't want her to feel like that . He scooped up his compact little bundle . ' Ripener ! ' She said it as if it were an insult . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood straight and smiled at her . ' No . Can I help it if I am sent for ? ' This required an effort , Juniper had always been first , but the poor girl ' When the police come , what can I do then ? ' He reached into the bundle and took out a string of turquoise . It was worth half of all the rest , but it was the first thing he touched that would come loose . ' Keep this for me , blue-painted girl . ' She took it , watching his face , ' You 'll come back ? ' ' I said , " Keep this for me . " ' Warm colour ran up in her face and she began to cry . He left the tipi , feeling his hands sweat and wondering if she were going to have a baby . On the afternoon of the third day , in answer to a remark of Brave Man 's , he sang the song , ' Blame not me but the gods . How can I help it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his old way , his head thrown back , his voice high-reaching , his teeth showing in his smile , but he did n't feel just like that . He 'd meant to return of his own accord , with his winnings in his hand , and the police had come for him . There were many girls , but the thought of losing Juniper darkened the sun and made one 's middle heavy.  | There are many girls , but only the one Juniper . And that was Warrior Comes Forth who looked at him and then went on plucking the warp strands of the loom . What a nice little yellow shirt she 'd made for him , and the edge of the weaving that he could see looked handsome . He noticed many things , but he had to pay attention to Juniper sitting there . It was the same face he had always known , the familiar face , the oval and the long eyes , the fine nostrils , the delicate mouth , the definite chin , and the wings of dark hair sweeping back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , to whom he belonged , who could become ... The voice he knew so well and never forgot , greeting him quietly . But behind the face , under the voice , it was different . He said , ' I 've brought you some things , ' and dumped out his winnings , jewelry and hard , round dollars . She said , ' You went to the Winter People ? ' ' Yes . There was another game at Tse Tlichi , and then a Mountain Chant at T'o Dotosoni , and then I heard of a game at Hatso Ntyel . Then I thought I might as well go on over and get some of those people 's goods while I was at it , for us to have . I was just finishing when Brave Man came . ' She studied his face . There were many girls , but she was one of those women who have a key to life . She was looking at him . Those long eyes . ' You can take it with you , ' she said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unsaddle . ' He stepped back and leaned one hand on his saddlehorn . She became far away , the world filled with an empty silence . He moved his jaws twice while his mind raced , seeking , over a smooth surface affording no hold . At length he said : ' When Brave Man came , I was thinking about coming back . Right at that time I was deciding on it . I have never let you out of my mind . I have sung your songs only to myself . I have been for you , always . You and my son . '  |p236She  put out one hand and touched a post of the loom , then returned it to her lap . He had never seen a face so completely calm and blank . ' You do n't expect me to sleep with you whenever you happen to come home ? ' A man has to stay whole . With the loveliest girl in the world , even with juniper , he has to stay whole . Just looking at her , he knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ best thing to do was not to say it . Then a man still had something to take away . ' Keep the hard goods , ' he told her , hearing his voice from a distance . ' If you leave them here , I 'll throw them away . ' ' Let them belong to my son . There 's more than a hundred dollars there . ' ' All right . ' He swung to his saddle as a man should , in one smooth motion . Without letting himself pause , he started off at a walk , a trot , a lope , into a strange , drab world . How odd that the bushes and trees looked the same , the sand was still bright , the rocks still painted . He realized that he was done with hoeing corn . He knew that the fullness of losing juniper had not yet torn at his heart . A man can not be owned by a woman . He decided to go west and see what the Mokis were like.  | JEROME McCARTY came into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dr. Butler said , ' Come in , Jerome . We 'd almost given you up . ' ' I was stuck in the mud near Leupp . We had a heavy rain over there . I had to wait until some Hopis came along in a truck and pulled me out . ' He pointed to his mud-heavy trousers and shoes , and smiled again . He took a seat at the table , nodding to the others . Butler tapped a pencil on his memorandum pad . ' I guess you know what this meeting 's about , ' he said . McCarty nodded . ' I have another communication from the Board . They want us to take definite action against this administration . Or the way they put it ' He referred to a letter lying open before him . ' " An interdenominational delegation is going to Washington to ask the Commissioner for a definite answer , yes or no , as to whether he is an Atheist . Whatever his answer may be , his new circular order number Dz6L4i leaves us no doubt as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the situation to be particularly acute among the Navajos , with the new day-school program there . This , the largest tribe of Indians in the United States , must be saved from blindly following a professed advocate of paganism . " ' Larrimer said , ' The Navajos never followed anyone blindly , but I know what they mean . ' Boyle said , ' The Navajos are news . They 've been publicized . If they oppose this man , attention will be paid to them . This New Deal ! '  |p238Butler  raised his hand . ' We do the Indians no favour if we mix them into general politics . Let us confine ourselves to the Office of Indian Affairs . Are you all familiar with that order ? ' He looked around the table , then said thoughtfully , ' It seems correct according to the Constitution . ' Rensselaer cleared his throat . ' It looks constitutional , yes , but if you go deeper  --  gentlemen , this is a Christian country . The founders of the Republic never intended that the Bill of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word . Let us grant for a moment that it may be incorrect for religious instruction to be compulsory in a school supported by federal funds . ' Boyle snorted . ' Just grant that for a moment . The new order allows cooperationand a limited use of school facilities . It 's a practical matter , Mr. Boyle ; that 's a poor point of attack . But when the order also allows the child to have religious instruction by a medicine man if he asks for it , why , then the thing becomes ridiculous . The matter reverses itself ; it becomes a ruling to discourage Christian missionary efforts and encourage heathenism . It 's indefensible . ' Butler nodded . ' Well put , Charles . ' Larrimer said quietly : ' Most of the Indian Service employees know that . This administration ca n't last forever . Does anyone know of a school where this order is being put into full effect ? ' ' That 's only half an answer , Ned , ' Boyle said . ' It 's the tendency , the whole tendency @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course . ' Trubee was bad enough , ' Boyle went on , ' but Farraday tops them all . He 's a sentimentalist . Wants to preserve the tribes , worships Indian culture . Filling the Indian Service with young radicals . This business of organizing the tribes  --  Soviets , that 's what he wants to set up . He 's a Communist . ' Butler said : ' At any rate , his religious policies are seriously bad . These day schools completely frustrate mission work . '  |p239'Yes  , ' McCarty remarked . ' The children go right home . Back to the medicine men . ' ' The key points of attack are two , ' Larrimer said . ' They depend on each other . We must prevent the tribe from organizingunder the Connell-Thomson Act . Are we agreed on that ? ' The men looked towards McCarty . The Navajo nodded . ' We have our Council , that 's enough . These permanent tribal organizations under the new law  --  they 're a move to send us back to the blanket , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , instead of helping us to merge into the great body of the citizenry . The so-called self-governmentis a trap . It 's segregation . ' Smedley , who sat at the end of the table opposite Butler , asked , ' How did that law ever get passed ? ' ' That Indian Welfare bunch , ' Boyle snapped . ' Them and the women 's clubs , and a flock of radicals , and a lot of high pressure from Farraday . ' Larrimer continued . His quiet , dignified way of talking went well with his white hair . ' The way to get at that , and our main line of attack with the Indians in any case , is the stock reduction . This so-called self-government is just what Jerome said it is ; it 's also a device to shift the onus of further reducing the sheep , and the purpose of that , I do believe , is to render the Navajos dependent upon Washington 's bounty . ' Butler said : ' I 've been in the Navajo country some thirtysixyears . From @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the expert studies , I have come to believe that the reservation is overstocked and really is in danger of becoming a true desert . ' ' The experts ! ' Boyle growled . Smedley asked , ' How about it , Jerome ? ' ' With the tribe increasing the way it is , of course we have to have more farming and less grazing . The range is overstocked . But see how the Government is going about it ! Why do n't they develop more water first , more irrigatedp240land ? Then the demonstration areas  --  large tracts of our land put under fence , and when poor Indians want to graze their hungry sheep there , seeing the good grass , they have to get permission from an absolute autocrat , usually one of these experts with no sympathy or knowledge of the people . ' ' These controlled areas are producing good grass ? ' asked Butler . They pick out favoured spots , ' Larrimer said contemptuously . Butler saw Boyle eyeing him . Either Boyle or Smedley would be glad to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all straight , ' he said . ' Being stationed at Wingate , I do n't get on the reservation as I used to . ' He began drawing angular diagrams on his memorandum pad . Rensselaer asked , These areas were fenced without consent of the Indians ? ' McCarty hesitated . ' I would n't quite say that . Of course high pressure was used , and local Indians were tempted by the pay for doing the fencing . The fact remains that they are there . And in some quarters there 's a rumour  --  a suspicion that when the Commissioner has enough land fenced and covered with good grass , he 's going to sell it off to white men . ' ' That 's absurd , ' Butler said . He caught Boyle 's eye , and returned to his diagrams . Perhaps it is , ' Rensselaer said , but it indicates tribal distrustof their self-styled benefactor . Do n't you gentlemen see how all Mr. McCarty 's points hang together ? Here 's an overpopulated , overstocked desert reservation ; the Governmentasks the Indians to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that in the indefinite future they can make the place a garden . ' Boyle interrupted with They say that if the sheep are reduced by half , they can make the survivors twice as large and covered with twice as much wool . There 's an absurdity for you ! ' P241'Quite so . Meantime , instead of encouraging the Navajos to solve their problem by going out into the world and living as white men , what are they doing ? Protecting the old religion , encouraging so-called Indian arts with all their emotional tie-in with ancient times and ways , building day schools , whooping it up for tribal self-government , for holding the Navajos together , for holding them back . Gentlemen , this program must be stopped . ' Butler nodded , and Boyle exclaimed , ' That 's it ! ' ' Two things we must be careful to speak well of , ' McCarty said . ' The attempt they 're making to get the old Navajo country east of the reservation added to it . That 's going to be a hard fight , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water development ; only on that score , we want twice , four times as much as is being done . ' ' That 's all clear , then , ' Larrimer said . ' How do we go about it ? Jerome , you and other Christian leaders are agreed on this ? You can work together in the tribe ? ' ' I believe so . Most of us . ' ' In that connection , ' Rensselaer put in , ' I 'd like to mention young Begay . I think he could be useful . ' Larrimer looked at him enquiringly . ' Allan and Mr. McCarty and Mr. Boyle , I believe , can vouch for him . The boy has just passed his examinations for Zwinglian with flying colours and has received a scholarship . I 've promised him a summer on the reservation . ' ' I know him , ' McCarty said . ' An excellent young man and a good speaker . He comes from a backward part of the reservation , and he might , he might have some influence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he is , no one would listen to him . ' Butler cleared his throat , then hesitated . ' Local white opinion near the reservation is important . Myron is a likeableand sincere young man . If he could speak to mission societies and other such groups , he would make a strong impression . And remember , he knows the religion , he was initiated . That 's invaluable to his testimony . '  |p242Rensselaer  nodded . ' Good . His recent success has given him confidence , which he badly needed . But he 's overtired and longs for a vacation , we must allow him his well-earned rest . He 's waited at Santa Fe this long only so as to hear about his examinations . ' Smedley said : ' I 've a mission meeting at Flagstaff next week  --  July fifth . It falls very pat after the pagan dances and art exhibition the chamber of commerce and the museum there put on in connection with the Fourth . If he could come and speak at that , it would be a relief to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he could go on into the reservation from there . ' ' Excellent , ' Butler said . ' It will try him out . Then perhaps in early September ' He looked enquiringly at Rensselaer . ' Certainly . He 'll be delighted to do it . ' Larrimer said , ' Let 's get back to the main campaign . Now , I 've been contacting some of the other denominations ... '   SLAYER OF ENEMY GODS let out a breath in the faintest of sighs . At the same moment , Child of the Waters turned towards him , his right hand resting on his knife of dark flint . They looked into each other 's eyes . They had encompassed it , from the sacred mountain of the centre to the ends of the world between the two oceans , the little parts , the smallest things , and the great whole . Child of the Waters said , ' Now . ' His elder brother said : ' A way is about to be opened to us . One of our People is going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can bring something about . ' Standing at the end of the Rainbow Trail they took in their country again , without effort and in an instant , loving it and its people . ' We are their helpers , ' Child of the Waters said . ' That is what we are for . ' They continued , looking down upon the country they had cleared of monsters , the people they had guarded , while their thoughts communicated . The gods can not help a man until he opens the way for them . They could not give corn and other planted foods to mankind until Natinesthani was ready to receive the idea of going to the end of Old Age River . They could not help him to go there until he had done his utmost for himself . When the People are bewildered , when their leaders disagree and tug in all directions , the gods can not merely step in . They must look for men who can be guided towards the truth . They may plant a little act which takes years to ripen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to them , and the gods must work through men . Only the gods have patience enough to do that . They became covered with their armour of dark flint , dark flint moccasins , dark flint leggings , dark flint shirts , dark flint head-dresses . Sheet lightning rustled softly through the overlapping pieces of gleaming stone , so that they quivered like leaves in a faint breeze . Zizgag lightning came out of Nayeinezgani 's quiver , flashing and returning . They stood on a short rainbow , under a blue beam from their father Sun Bearer , with their mother 's white shell hanging high above them .   MYRON went out by himself , to think and to gather his forces . He was excited and nervous , . and those ladies kept fussing over him . They were very nice , but they made him feel choked and even with all the excitement , the fatigue that kept buzzing in his head made it hard to talk to them . He carried the mask in a paper bag under his arm . From the house where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big pine trees near at hand . Widely spaced , the sun poured down between them , and the air was heavy with balsam . Beyond their tops he saw part of the peak of San Francisco Mountain with flecks of snow on it . Dokoslid , the sacred mountain of the west . He was going to begin with a remark about that ; Mr. Smedley said it was a colourful literary allusion . He sat in the shadow of a big tree . At moments he felt sure that he would make a mess of his speech , but he told himself that that was just because he was tired . First about being on the slope of Dokoslid , and from that to Navajo country and pride in being a Navajo , and so to what a young , modern Navajo wanted , his aspirations , a Christian , progressive people going forth into the white world . The chains of ignorance and , superstition that held his people back , that isolated the drop in the barrel . From there he made a transitionto the Government 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The truth about this self-governmenttrap . Communism . So on and so on . He checked it over ; he knew it all right . He decided he would n't say much about stock reduction . He 'd heard his uncle and other olderP248men tell how the country was drying up , and Tall , Man  --  Trumbull  --  had voted for it . Trumbull was smart . He was n't sure stock reduction was so wrong ; Mr. Smedley did n't raise sheep . All that led up to the dramatic part , where he told them what some of the old superstitions were like . The initiation , being whipped . Mr. McCarty said sometimes they really whipped hard . Well , just say , ' whipped . ' Boys practically nude , in just moccasins and tiny little  --  what was that word ?  --  yes , ' totally inadequate ' breech-clouts , standing up in front of young girls . The girls did n't undress , but exhibiting the boys was bad enough . Then , Mr. Smedley said , ' Tell them what it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how smelly it is. , Well , yes , it had been sort of smelly . And of course it was unsanitary . Spread germs . Dirty masks . Yes . Then the climax , taking the mask out and showing them the ridiculous object before which my people bow down in superstitious awe . He touched the bag with one hand . He did n't want to uncover it out here . First place , it was the wrong mask , Nayeinezgani , all black with four lightnings going down one side . Mr. Smedley said it did n't make any difference , but it did in a way . Nayeinezgani was kind of admirable , and then , he was a lot more dangerous than Hasche Yahlti , now in the months when lightning can strike . That 's superstition ; there are n't any such gods . It was pretty close to the Navajos ' own country , here on the slope of Dokoslid . They made the mountain of the west fast to earth with a sunbeam . They adorned it with yellow shell , with black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of wild animals . They placed a shell dish on top , with two eggs of the yellow warbler in it , covered with sacred buckskins , so now there are many yellow warblers on Dokoslid . Over all they spread a yellow cloud , and they sent White Corn Boy and Yellow Corn Girl to dwell there . I wo n't quote any of that stuff at the beginning , he decided . P249It would sound funny when I 'm talking against the religion . It 's all just fairy stories , anyhow . A Christian has no fear . He looked at his watch ; twenty to five , time to start back . He felt tired all through , but after this he would be able to rest at last , to let go , and to see Ethel . Myron told Mr. Smedley not to worry , he had his talk well memorized . The missionary remembered that the young man had been a prize debater . He went to a mirror and checked over his costume . Dark suit , dark tie , stiff collar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hopi native missionary he met last night wore glasses , they gave an added touch . He wished he had a pair . He and Mr. Smedley and one of the ladies went into the big room together , where about twenty people sat on rows of chairs . The lady talked first , and she went on and on . A welcome breeze from a mountain rainstorm eased the stifling heat . At last she finished , and it was Mr. Smedley 's turn . He prayed first . Then he said he 'd be very brief , but he was n't . He made some jokes at which the people laughed , although Myron thought they sounded too much like school-teachers trying to be funny . Then he introduced Myron , saying a lot of very nice things which made one feel at once uncomfortable , surprised , and elated . Once he got going , Myron was all right . A thunderclap threw him off his stride near the beginning , but he mastered that . He made his points and transitions in good order , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the initiation he hesitated , but the eager response to his mention of the whipping and the all-but-nude boys carried him forward to his climax . ' Dis belongs to Nayeinezgani , ' he said , drawing forth the mask , de so-called Slayer of Enemy Gods . ' Through the window he saw a brilliant , angular streak of lightning . It flashed four times in the same place . He remained with his mouth open , frozen , through the following crash . The audience had their backs to the window so didP250not see the flash , but some of them commented on the noise . He swallowed , coughed , and after a few stammering words went smoothly to the end . They applauded him heartily . He felt weak and rather ill . It had been different from making a speech at school , and then he 'd been frightened , not for any real reason , but just scared and all sorts of pictures of the god running in his mind when it came right at that moment . He wanted to go off by himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to talk to him and ask him questions . Many of them asked if there were n't other indecent rites that he had n't mentioned , they seemed to want them . He told them , truly , that as far as ceremonies he had seen , the only other thing was that couples did go off together into the bushes sometimes , during the squaw dances , but the Navajos disapproved of it . The questioners irritated him . The Navajos might be ignorant , but they were not dirty . At last the meeting broke up . He told Mr. Smedley , who was enormously pleased with him , that he thought he 'd go for a walk . It had been a big day , his first real public appearance , he felt that it was the true beginning of being a preacher , told himself how successful he 'd been , but nothing would banish the bottomless , black mood into which he 'd fallen . He guessed it was because he was tired , but that did n't seem to be the main thing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that fright entirely ; he 'd certainly been scared . Coincidence , you could see how ignorant people came to believe such things . He looked up , over his shoulder , to see the peak against sky which was taking on the evening quality . All clear now . It was hotter in the main part of town while the sun lingered , but he wanted the walls on either hand and the many people . The street was still lively with visitors to the celebrations , which lasted several days , white men , both Anglo and Spanish , generally tricked out in more or less cowboy style , Indians of many kinds . He heard Navajo spoken all about him , and avoided the speakers . He felt guilty and P251ashamed , and kept on reasoning with himself . It was like that time after the football game , only different and ever so much worse . Then I kissed Ethel , it was then I won her . Jack and I had stopped being friends before that . Jack was heathen and it had to happen sometime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new little boy at Yellow Earth standing up to that big Chishi . Two children making their way together , determined together ... An old association brought up the young Twin Gods in his mind . Not that he 'd ever thought of himself and Jack as being like gods , but there had been something you understood about those two Boys playing and setting forth for adventure together . You had to turn your face against Jack , against the Twins , you had to give your testimony against them . They were almost as vivid to him as the memory of his friend . I ca n't ever enjoy thinking of them again , they 're false gods . Desolation swept over him . He shook himself . What 's wrong with me ? I 'm through now , and I 'm going to see Ethel and have a vacation . I 'd better eat . He could n't face going into a bright , crowded place . The streets were growing cool now , at the restaurant doors thick heat and clamour came forth . There were the lights @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Dark , quiet , and cool . Happily , with my interior feeling cool , may I walk . He shook his head . Stop that . A Western and a romance , he hoped the Western was on . The lady in the ticket window hardly looked at him , she was used to Indians . She did n't know that he was the one who defied Nayeinezgani and all the people clapped hard . He was just in time for the Western ; there were cowboys and horses , and fast riding , and that was fine . Then there were some Indians whom the movie people took for Apaches , but anyone could see they were Sioux , and they were all villains and cruel and treacherous . The picture made them seem pretty bad , and at the same time made fun of them . He got up and left . People ought to know that Indians were n't like that . P252It was much cooler outside now . His feet felt heavy and his legs ached , but he kept on wandering , sometimes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not wanting to go back to the house where he and Mr. Smedley were staying . Tomorrow Mr. Smedley would find a car going towards Gideon and get him a ride . Then Ethel . Then the whole rest of the summer , at ease , and the long horseback days alone . Picnics with Ethel ; something dragged at him , discolouring his pleasure . The mission , Ethel , they were all right , but there was something wrong with going among the Navajos . He saw the dark faces , the poor clothes , the old men and the boys his age , and he did n't want to come before them . Why did I say that about standing up in a breechclout , and about the whipping ? False testimony . But how could you explain to them that even if the Navajos are wrong , still it 's not  --  it 's not ... He stood still on a dark street corner , wrestling , with a sense of physical effort . He turned sharply and walked down the street . Everywherehe turned , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the matter ? Tired , that 's it , I 'm tired . I wish my head would stop humming . Is Ethel really Christian ? Why does she love me ? If I could go out there , right now , right now . Maybe she 's still at Tlichisenili . Oh . Maybe there 's a letter for me at Santa Fe . Ethel , her trust and admiration , comfort , peace . There is no such god , those gods do n't even exist . Thou shalt have none other gods .. . He crossed the railroad track , and was vaguely aware that most of the people he passed were speaking Spanish , now a few bars and eating-places were scattered along the street , from some of which came music . Promising Ethel to sing jazz , Navajo songs , too . He imagined a tune in silence , and the very thought of even the most meaningless gambling song was intensely painful . I 'll never sing them again . He turned up a side street leading back across the track . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two men walking towards him , talking Spanish , and when theyP253were near him , saw them with their arms across each other 's shoulder . He caught the smell of their drinking , and stepped aside to let them by . One of them half turned , peered at him with out-thrust face , and said something . Myron stepped farther aside . The man laid a hand on his arm and spoke again . He jerked away and walked on rapidly . The man shouted , ' Whatsa matter , you Eendian son of a beetch ? ' Both of them broke into catcalls , and then threw unintelligibleSpanish after him . You did n't have to understand it . When Mexicans turn insulting , they use a mocking , highpitchedvoice which is inescapable . Myron clenched his fists , thinking Nakai , dirty , smelly Nakai . ' Son of a beetch ! ' The other man yelled , ' 0-ho-ho-ho , ' in a recognizable parody of the final Night Chant tune . Myron 's mind was a whirl of quick thoughts and feelings , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty ceremonies , the contempt ready to jump forth .. . ' God damn Eendian ! ' The screech seemed to hit him . He felt light on his feet . What 's the matter with you , halfback ? Jack said . He swung around . Nakai , just a couple of smelly Nakai . He was alive . He did n't even notice that fatigue was gone as he charged for his tribe . He did n't hear himself raise the wolf-bark . He was vaguely aware that there was no referee to prevent slugging . His coat was a nuisance . It happened fast . Something hit his shin painfully and there was a blow on the side of his head . He hit a face twice , was grabbed , and pounded a stomach . He crouched , and made a quick , lifting tackle , sending one man staggering back , then turned to give full attention to the other . He used his hands , his shoulders , his knees , and his feet , and suddenly the second man broke and ran , staggering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intention to get well away . As the first man came back , Myron saw the knife . He did n't have time to be frightened as he punted , his up-swing-P254ing leg taking his enemy at the knee . The Mexican cried out , and slashed as he fell . Myron felt the knife tear his coat . He sprang for the man 's hand , grabbed , twisted . The knife dropped and he threw it far . Then he jumped . He jumped four times , and when the man stopped trying to rise , he knelt and began battering . He saw nothing , he thought nothing . The red film misted over what he was doing , and he battered . Suddenly he thought of the knife and searched for it . He 'd heard it fall , but now he could n't find it . When Yei Tso , first of the Enemy Gods , was dead , the Younger Brother took his scalp . A flint knife . A flint knife . He searched . He felt calm , very much in hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flint . The flint youth am I. E-na . My heart of clear flint . The flint youth am I. E-na . No sign of it . He returned to his enemy . The man lay still . It was dark in the street , and quiet . The man lay still . Between two lightless houses he and this man 's spirit stood in an enclosure . He wanted to stoop and make sure that the man was dead , but the second part of an ancestral , inescapable pattern had set in full tide . He turned and ran . He stopped running on the edge of the bright centre of town . How did he come to have his hat in his hand ? His coat was cut in a long gash down the left side , his face battered , his knuckles bloody . He felt his throat . One wing of his collar rose up sideways and his tie was way out of place . He retreated to a darker section . Where sidewalks gave way to dirt road , he straightened himself as best he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smedley . Murder . That other man will say  --  Indian  --  murder . I ca n't go to him . Or Mr. Butler . Or anyone . Ethel . Oh Lord ! Oh Lord God , help me . Ethel . Leave here , leave here , get away from here . The dead , the blood-guilt hastened up to him so that he cringed . Get away from here . Killed a man . Go home . Ethel . Over the pass , through the gap to the northwest , lay theP255road to the Navajo country . Heavily he started walking , skirting the heart of town , out past the filling-stations . By and by one would come to where there were no houses and he could rest . Tired ; he thought he knew about being tired , but now he was emptied until his leg bones bent , and his sinews gave so that at each step he had to take up slack . He tried to pray as he tramped , but after what he 'd done he was n't sure about God . No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Must get away . He plodded on . Mr. Butler , Mr. Smedley , Mr. Rensselaer , Mr. Boyle , Mr. McCarty , Mr. murder angry guilty horrible end of work an angry god . God . God . God . Looking for the knife . Flint youth am I. God , the gods , at war with lightnings . Ethel , oh Ethel . Murder guilty Mr. Butler Mr. Smedley Mr. Butler Mr. Snyder . He had no idea how far he 'd walked . The paved road turned aside , and under his feet was dirt . Tall pines came to the edge of the ditch . Thinking of sheriffs and law , he dragged himselfyet another half mile , then left the road . The springy mat of grass and needles eased his ruined legs and called to his body . He went up over a rise , into a hollow , and found a rock which made an enclosure with three saplings . Into that he crept . He felt a little more protected , as if here the dead man , the Chinni , could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the track . The woods were lonely and silent , in their vast darkness all manner of things could be . Shooting Singer said , with perfect assurance , ' I have attended to all that . ' Kneeling , he started the Lord 's Prayer , was horrified by the sound of his own whisper , and said it through intensely , in silence . Christ 's prayer , Who had lived on earth , been a boy , grown up , suffered . Did He war against the other gods ? The power and the glory  --  am a jealous God  --  that was God not Jesus reaching over mountains , overthrowing the Divine Ones , wise untiring Nayeinezgani . Offended all offended murder the wrath the power murder guilt , his stomach sick at the memory of jumping pounding the unresistant prostrate horrorP256not dead perhaps not entirely killed . Oh God , do n't let him be dead . Caught between the gods , the great enemies fierce angry against each other . From kneeling he sank to a huddled crouch . Black , dark woods , dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre . That which stands up in me lies down . The guilt , the following guilt , Chindi . He looked over his shoulder , trembling . Shooting Singer coming serenely from the woods . Maid who becomes a bear Sought the gods and found them , On the mountain tops Sought the gods and found them . The recitation was mechanical , he was hardly aware of the words . Truly with my sacrifice Sought the gods and found them . Somebody doubts it , so I have heard . Dimly as he continued he heard his own voice in the hypnotic , heavy rhythm . The cold reached through his clothes and slid over his skin . His clothes were weightless . He heard a voice chanting . He crouched in breech-clout and moccasins , still carrying the blood upon him , uncleansed , alone in enemy territory , praying . I wander among their weapons . His own loud voice startled him back to himself . He pulled the torn jacket closer . Too tired . His mind blurred , the darkness tended to become a grey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness again . He saw stars through the treetops . He dug a hole for himself in the deep pine needles against the rock , and curled into it , shuddering . Greyness closed in on him .   NEITHER Indian nor white , neither Christian nor Navajo , nothing at all , a cypher , zero , he plodded slowly under the pressing heat . A hard , pebbly soil , grassless , spotted here and there with low-growing cactus and small , pale shrubs , stretched out before him . Quivering heat glanced upward from the surface , the light made him squint continuously . Far ahead a jumble of painted country fiercely open to the sun shouted of trials yet to come . His hat , a smallish , green felt , became heavy and the headbandwas slippery , but he needed the slight shade of its brim . His once white shirt , splotched with brown dust , let the sun directly through ; his trousers of dark serge clung to his legs , flopping and soft . The heat underfoot came through his shoes . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The whole mass of Dokoslid rose clear and following behind him , brown foothills , the green mountain , and the rocky peak piebald with snow ; he avoided looking back at it . Somewhere here he would cross the reservation line , and then in some favoured place he would find Indians , food and drink , shade in which to lie down . Raising his eyes , he saw a fence stretching out of sight to east and west . That was the line . There was no gate in sight . When he got close , he saw the fence was six-strand , high and tight , to keep in the strongest bull and the smallest lamb . He could go west to the highroad , but that was a mile or more . There might be a gate on some trail near here , or one might waste hours of strength searching . He squatted despondently . Climb it in a minute . P258For a moment it was a relief to be still , then the heat closed down in a different way , the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but an extra effort , and the menacing barbs . It gave him a sense of being unwelcome . He stared at a post with its nails and the ' Property of the United States ' sign at the top . It seemed right , a hostile face turned towards a man who gave false testimony against his tribe . How could you make those mission people understand that it could be superstitious and ignorant and false gods , and still be beautiful ? They would n't let you say that . God would n't let you . If you were for God , you hated all those things . Enemy Gods . Then God threw me out . Murder . Then would Ethel cast him off too ? First thing was to see Ethel , tell her straight out about it . She loves me , does she , will she still ? Why love me ? I thought I was pretty bright , but I guess  --  against his hip he could feel the warmth of the envelope which contained the notice of his scholarship for 1935  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here goes . The strands were too close for crawling through , so he climbed over , tearing his trousers in two places and scratching his forearm . When he was down on the other side , he stood thinking for a minute , then stopped and scraped up a handful of the hot , cindery soil . Navajo soil . It did n't look very friendly , nor did the country . It 's what I have . It 's the one thing I can always have . He dropped the handful as he moved forward . An Indian can go up and down , one way or another , but the land is what always remains . ! He glanced around . This part does n't look very valuable . He looked down at his trousers , their general effect now was thoroughly Navajo . It all goes together , we have to dress like our country . I 'll clean up before I see Ethel . There was plenty of water around Gideon , he remembered , some Indians and Mr. Boyle had irrigated fields there . Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find a hogahn ? He wondered how much longer he could keep going , feeling steadily more thirsty , and slightly giddy . Just got to keep onP259going . Over a rise and across a shallow dip and over another rise , no shade , no resting-place . A definite trail on which showed the clear , unshod hoofprints of Indian travel , encouragedhim enormously . He followed it northwesterly . That cheer died away and weakness returned as another hour 's travel brought him nowhere in an unknown , empty , and unreadable country . At last he saw a man coming , pushing his pony at a good trot . He waited in the trail , thankfulnesswelling up in him . Would the man stop for him , speak to him ? Or turn aside and hurry by ? Tall , straight-shouldered , slender , long hair under a wide , battered hat , shell and turquoisenecklace on a sun-faded , dusty , orange shirt , blue jeans , moccasins , a young man riding indolently , an utterly Navajo young man , a personification . The rider looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dust , a familiar , aquiline type , like a person one knew all about . Acting carefully , Myron gave him a casual Where to , tell ? ' ' To Many Houses . And you tell , where to ? ' ' To Ha'anoichi . ' The rider bent forward , staring . Myron stared . The man 's lips parted , drew wide , and the even teeth flashed in that lightgiving , thorough smile . ' Eh , my brother ! ' Brother ! ' The flood of thankfulness broke through inside of him . He smiled , but he could not trust himself to speak while their hands lingered together . Singing Gambler said , ' Walking ? ' but he could n't answer , only cough . ' I thought you were a white man at first , and it was you all the time . That funny hat , and your face is so pale . ' Myron said , ' I 've been in a house all winter . ' Singing Gambler looked sympathetic . ' Did the police get you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Did the police , have they , are they  --  it was funny and it hurt . His laughterP260wrath . The dead man followed less close upon his heels . You may be exhausted and starved with thirst , but the horse does the walking for you . On a horse , you can get through . ' I 'll take you there , ' Singing Gambler said . ' It 's late , anyhow . I 'll start again for Many Houses tomorrow . ' ' Why are you going there ? ' ' For the celebrations . The races and dancing and all that . ' ' You 're too late , ' Myron said . His voice sounded harsh . He controlled it . ' There were three days of it , and it 's allover . ' ' Oh . Well , I 'll go over west and look at the Wide Canyon and the Supais then , I think . ' ' You 're travelling far . ' ' Yes . ' After they had ridden some distance , Singing Gambler said , ' Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching him . ' Juniper ? Why  --  yes . ' ' I married her . ' ran up high in the dancing sunlight , Dokoslid bowed over to listen . This man came riding and said Singing Gambler slipped to earth and caught him . ' Easy , my brother . Gently . The sun is strong . ' He looked Myron over with real attention . ' Sit here , in my horse 's shadow . ' Slowly his breath came to rest . He was ashamed . ' I have walked all the way from Many Houses , last night and today . ' ' Coyote ! ' ' I have n't eaten , and since I left the trees , there 's been no water on the road . ' ' You travel fast . You 're worn out , I think . There 's a hogahn back here not so far . Get on behind me , and I 'll take you there . ' ' All right . Thanks . ' Singing Gambler saw he was in trouble , he asked no questionsbut gave his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divineP261Myron said nothing . He remembered her quality , somehowshe did n't quite seem the wife for this man . ' It seems odd to you , perhaps . She is a great woman , a beautiful person . I thought I could change myself . For a short time I changed myself , but then it was too much for me , and then I was too much for her . So I 'm travelling . ' Myron showed his understanding by a non-committal , friendly grunt . ' You knew her . When we were at that dance  --  do you remember  --  you looked at each other and she went out after you . I was afraid of you then . But you went back to school ' He paused , considering the idea of a man who could have had juniper and left her . ' I ca n't mention her to strangers , but you saw her , so I tell it to you . ' Myron said , ' That 's too bad . I 'm sorry . ' What had happened to Singing Gambler squeezed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not the only trouble in the world . ' We have a son , a fine boy . But I did the wrong things and she just told me not to unsaddle . The boy , that keeps on reaching out and tugging . ' ' You 're going to go back in a while to ask her again ? ' ' No , I think . You know her . I 'd have to turn into somebody else . What I am is not what she can live with . ' ' But - ' Just do n't ask me about it , my friend . ' Myron fell silent . It seemed too much to have other people suffering , too . He wished he could fix it for this man to be perfectly happy . Where a trail ran off from the one they followed , Singing Gambler said , ' Here 's where they get their water . You want some , do n't you ? ' ' I do ! ' They skirted the edge of a steep drop . Pointing into the depression , half canyon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over there , under the bluffs  --  see  --  that 's where I ate lunch . Then over that way , farther on , are two more hogahns . ' P262The sand turned to a purple-brown rock , the trail was a smooth-worn ribbon tumbling down into a cleft now entirely full of shadow , at the bottom of which grew some grass and scrub-oaks . The pony , stepping prettily with accurate placementof each small hoof in turn , took them down to the smell of water , a wide drip over wet stone slimy with water growths , a narrow pool , and reeds . Damp sand soaked up against Myron 's stomach while he filled himself , wet his hands and face , made himself new . He dawdled in the luxury of wetness , and at last drew back , replenished . They sat with their backs against the cool rock . Myron refused to smoke . Singing Gambler looked around the place of water with pleasure . ' Here with the rocks close about , voices should sound well . Let 's sing . ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . ' I ' There was too much , one could n't tell about it , did n't want to . I 'm  --  well  --  in between . ' ' You have some trouble , I think . ' ' Yes . I may end in jail . Back there , I killed a man . ' ' What ! ' ' A Mexican . I killed him with my hands and feet . He wasMyron stopped , seeing Singing Gambler 's face as he rose . ' When ? ' ' The night before last . So I came right on . ' Was this man going to betray him ? ' I covered my tracks pretty well , I think , I mixed up my trail . ' Singing Gambler relaxed slightly . ' Well , he may not have followed you . ' He glanced upwards . ' The sun will set in a few minutes . My brother , I do n't want to be near you after dark . You must find a singer quickly . You may have shaken him off , butMyron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A Mexican , you say ? Well , it shows that even a schoolboy can be a warrior . Listen  --  dop263you remember , I showed you where the trail went off to those other hogahns ? ' The gambler looked him over . ' You need help . Perhaps you 've got rid of it . Anyhow , you need help . Take my horse and go to that place . Do n't turn off to the hogahn you can see , I 'm going there . Hurry up , it 's getting late . ' But you'I 'm in good shape . I can get a horse with my earrings or something . ' ' I can walk . ' ' You need a horse and saddle . Go along . ' ' Well , here ' Myron fished out some money . ' Here . I 've nine dollars . ' ' Did you take this off the Mexican ? ' ' No . ' ' If you 're going on , looking for help , you 'll need something . Have you any more ? ' Myron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ' All right , I 'll take this , then . Now go along , before it gets dark down here . Those people are all Ashkaantsoni ; just tell them you 're in trouble with the police , and I sold you the horse . They 'll never give you away to the white men . ' About to mount , Myron paused . ' But if you 're afraid of me , why do you send me to those people ? ' Singing Gambler smiled slowly . ' You covered up your tracks , . perhaps you have got free of it . Only , knowing this , I feel uncomfortable with you . They can take care of themselves , I think . ' Myron laughed . He mounted , his long legs fitting comfortablyto the stirrups , and quirted the horse into motion . ' I 'll see you somewhere . ' ' Yes . ' He was so much of a piece , warm-hearted and selfish . As the horse lurched and scrambled upward , Myron hoped that the man could find what he lacked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to have any more suffering and loneliness in this world , and partly for himself , for Ethel , for a world in which things could work out that way . The Ashkaantsoni clansmen received him pleasantly . Few strangers came that way , and during the summer months only three families , owning few sheep , remained in this section . They pastured in the crevasses and gorges leading down to the little Colorado River , and grew their corn in certain spots of pure sand where moisture lingered deep down . Their food was poor , some wild roots , meat of two prairie dogs , tortillas , and coffee very sparingly sugared . The children were two girls , a small boy , and a baby . The eldest girl had been back from school about a year . She looked frail , and coughed a good deal . They were all cheerful and took pleasure in the smallest item of news , any new subject for thought and discussion . Myron said he had gone to Many Houses in a car with some friends , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He bought his horse from a man who came by here yesterday . They recognized the animal . The father , noting his haggard face , said that young men got into a lot of trouble in towns , on account of the whiskey . Schoolboys were inclined to run wild when they first came home . He hoped the traveller was going to settle down now . Where was his home ? He said he lived near Tsaili , and when that meant nothing to them , explained that it was at the foot of the Lukachukais . The man said that was far away , and questioned him about his country . He answered in detail , with pleasure , astonished to find how clearly he remembered it , the grazing , the water , the people , the mountains . Then they discussed this dry section . It was time the rains began . ' There have been clouds in the northwest , ' his host said , ' but they break up again . Then we have seen fine , dark clouds around Dokoslid . Did any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one . A he-rain , very short . ' ' The men here in this canyon are going to the spring to-P265morrow , to pray , to help the rain coming . Perhaps you will stay over and help us . ' The mere invitation was like sudden good news . He knew ' the happy union of men building a prayer together . He stared into the fire . Perhaps he would not be struck down for attempting to pray , perhaps no such gods existed ; it did n't matter , one way or the other it would be false . He loved these poor , friendly people . Belief or no belief , I want to respect what they are doing . He said slowly : ' No , I think . I have been away at school a long time , away from all those things . I 'm not able to help at that just now . ' ' You have eaten the pollen ? ' ' Yes . But I am worrying about things . I am disturbed in my mind . I might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Perhaps you are right . ' ' Tomorrow , as I go riding , I shall think well about rain . I shall look towards wherever clouds gather and remember you happily . ' ' Good . ' His host smiled slightly , pleased by right thinking in a sacred matter . A little later Myron said he was tired , and borrowed a tattered blanket and a sheepskin . Lying on sand still faintly warm , with the air becoming cool around him , he sighed deeply . He missed a pillow , he was out of practice for this . Am I doing harm to these people , staying here when my guilt , the dead , the Chindi  --  I know there is no Chindi . I know I do n't believe that . It 's in me only , if I told them they 'd be frightened , unhappy . I carry it , whatever it is . I have to work it out .

We have found no one who will admit seeing him between that hour and the time Miss Bonner found him dead , a little before seven o'clock . But as I said , neither do we find anyone who could not have had an opportunity . Ranth did leave this house around four o'clock , and returned some twenty minutes later -- and , according to his story , went to see you in your room . Your daughter Janet was out of the house for over two hours previous to the arrival of guests .

She leveled her eyes at him : " You say Mr. Ranth picked that up from the grass ? " " Yes . Miss Bonner saw him . He put it in his pocket , and Chisholm took it away from him . " Mrs. Storrs looked at Ranth , who had stood throughoutas if waiting for something , and knowing what . Composed , he met her eyes , and said nothing . She asked in a breath , " Twice , Mr. Ranth ? " Still he said nothing . She returned to Sherwood : " Twice , yesterday , Mr. Ranth had that paper taken from him  --  as if that could matter , since it is a debt to Siva and I shall pay it . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me  --  which ended badly . My husband left the house  --  you say my daughter saw him go . Mr. Ranth received a demonstration from Siva , which you would not understand . He too left the house , to find my husband , to assert the debt ; I agreed to it . Soon he returned , and his rage passed into me , I received the spirit of it , when he told me that my husband had refused all offering to Siva , had kept the paper , had again insulted the principles of the cause . But he did not tell me that Siva had closed the cycle of destruction , that my husband was dead . " Ranth said in a tone of ice , " I did . not tell you that , Mrs. Storrs , because it was not true . Your husband was alive and unhurt . " Sherwood wheeled on him : " But you did tell her that Storrs had kept the paper ? " " I did . " " You had seen Storrs at that spot where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " I had . " " You lied when you told us you had not been there , you had not seen him , you had had that paper constantly in your possession , you had not picked it up from the grass , you had not attempted to conceal it ? You lied when you told us all that ? " " Yes , I lied . " Colonel Brissenden licked his lips . There were movementsamong the others ; Sylvia so gripped Dol 's arm with her strong tennis hand that Dol had to pry at her fingers . Len Chisholm stood up and sat down again . Sherwood , with his head sunk into his shoulders , purred at Ranth , " If you want to , you may tell us exactly what happened . " Ranth looked at Mrs. Storrs and spoke to her : " What I told you yesterday was the truth . I found your husbandthere in the nook and told him our decision . He would concede nothing . I showed him the note you had signed . He seized it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . he would not listen . I left him there . You know that my spirit has forsworn vio-lence . " Mrs. Storrs retorted to his eyes : " Siva , for his violence , must have instruments . You are the instrument of Siva . " Ranth raised both his hands and slowly and firmly pressed the palms against his chest . " No . I am a part of Siva , and Siva has many parts . I know you are betrayed by weakness , and I forgive you . " He turned to Sherwood : " Yes , I lied to you to protect the universal principlewhich I serve . I know that before all unbelievers I am in danger . I knew that you could show that I got money from Mrs. Storrs , and that Storrs was attempting to make that impossible . I knew that you could show that with Storrs dead and Mrs. Storrs in possession of his property , I would benefit . I knew all that yesterday , when Belden told us Storrs had been killed , and when I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought I was n't a fool , but I was a fool twice , first when I tried to remove that paper without being seen , and second when I failed to foresee that Mrs. Storrs , by the shock to her blood and her nerves , could abandon all the hope I have furnished her and the truth I have taught her . So in that foolishness , I lied to you . I am not an instrument of violence . I could not be . " Sherwood looked at Brissenden , and at his assistant beside him . The colonel growled , " Charge him ! " The man with spectacles pursed up his lips and raised his brows , moving his head slowly in indecision . But Mrs. Storrs was talking : . . . and I could share the guilt if it were mine or if there were guilt to share . But there can be guilt only where it is felt , and while I could feel it I know that Siva could not . I know that the Sakti ritual of Kamakshya , which includes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the destroyer-god , must fulfill his godship ; but I am not Durga or Parvati , I am not ripe . They were pregnant of the world and of life ; I am only a woman . Siva should have known that . Mr. Ranth should have known it . The cycle of destruction and restoration is in my spirit , and I would have sacri/ficed much to its demands , but I could not leave entirely behind me the sphere . . . " Sherwood was only half hearing her ; he was calculatingshrewdly to himself , " She would be a knockout for a witness , with that cycle of destruction stuff  --  I could get it in by relating it to Ranth 's tie-up with her and therefore his motive  --  a jury would eat it up , they 'd love it  --  charge him now , I think  --  yes , I think so . . . . " But Colonel Brissenden was on his feet . He did have velocity . He moved swiftly around the table , around Mrs. Storrs still justifying her personal petty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ George Leo Ranth and , red-faced , stuck his chin out : " Come on , you , cough it up . Get it over . We 've got you cold . Where 's the gloves you used ? " Ranth moved back a step . Brissenden followed him , chest to chest , towering : " Come on , let 's have it . Where 's the gloves ? We 've got you ! You realize that ? Get it over  --  " " Wait a minute ! " Everybody turned . Brissenden halted , glaring . Len Chisholm , with no haste but with purpose evident in his face , arose from his chair and repeated gruffly : " Wait a minute with that stuff . " He abandoned Brissenden and addressed Sherwood : " You said Ranth left the house around four o'clock and returned twenty minutes later . Is that right ? " But the colonel had steamed up . He exploded , " You sit down and we 'll tell you what 's right when we get to you ! There 's been enough of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him off . " Go ahead and put your foot in it , and if you break a leg I can stand it . I 'm only telling you something . " Sherwood put in , " Please , Colonel . Just a minute . " To Chisholm : " Go ahead . " Len growled at him , " This makes me a princess . I know that . But if I get the idea right , that Ranth got back to the house at 4:20 , and he is supposed to have killed Storrs before that , there 's nothing doing . Storrs was in that place alive at 4:40 . I saw him there , on that bench . " Brissenden glared . There were murmurs . Sherwood snapped : " You told us you looked for Storrs and could n't find him . " " Yeah , I know . " Len grimaced . " I lied too . That may give you a lot of exercise , but the real point is that I saw Storrs asleep on that bench at twenty minutes to five . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no despair in his peril , he now displayed no exultaexultationin his relief . All he did was sit down , for the first time since entering the room . He gazed a moment at Chisholm 's determined and truculent face , then retreatedin good order to a chair behind Foltz and Zimmerman . An exclamation of surprise had come from Dol Bonner , from the others only an astonished silence . Brissenden frowned at Ranth 's retreating back as a hawk at a rabbit that had reached the brush . Then he wheeled on the attorney and demanded : " Get ' em all out of here but this bird Chisholm . We can handle him better alone . " Sherwood shook his head . " Not yet . " To Chisholm his tone was not friendly : " You got the jump on us , did n't you ? " Len walked to him . " I do n't get you . I 'm just telling you  --  ' , " Yes , I heard you . Sit down .  --  Will you please sit down ? " Len @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vacated , and sat . Sherwood was speaking to the room : " I 'd like to tell you folks something . All of you . I believe in frankness . That 's the way I like to work . I do n't set traps . You are all welcome to know anything107p108I have found out about this . If one of you is guilty it wo n't help him any in the end , and it would be no advantageto me to try to be slick with the rest of you . Nor will it help you any to try to be slick with me . It wo n't get you anywhere . " He turned sharply to Chisholm : " Where has it got you ? Last night you told me you looked for Storrs and could n't find him . Since then you 've remembered that the assistant gardener saw you coming from the direction of the fish pool between 4:30 and 5 o'clock , and you know I 've questioned him , so you decided to get the jump on me by telling me calmly that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Am I ? " " I do n't suppose so . " Len sounded morose . " I do n't know anything about any assistant gardener . I spoke up because I had reason to know you were pulling a foul on Ranth . Little as I love Ranth . " " You did n't know the gardener saw you yesterday ? " " No . " " You did n't see him ? " " I was n't looking for gardeners . I was too mad to look for gardeners . " " Mad at who ? Storrs ? " " No . Oh , I suppose him too . Everybody . At 4:40 yesterday afternoon my anger was universal . " " But you were mad enough at Storrs to threaten yesterday morning , in the presence of three people , to come out here and strangle him . " " Was I ? " Len 's brows lifted . " Maybe I did that . But the ratio of murders threatened to murders accomplishedis probably a million to one , so look at the oddsp109against your getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you 've got a legitimate complaint against me ; I told you a lie last night , and I should n't have done it . Now I 've got to explain , I realize that , and my explanation is no good . I mean , there 's nothing creditableabout it , and nothing discreditable either . I was just too lazy to tell the truth . " Brissenden emitted a sound that was half snort and half snarl . Sherwood asked , " You 're being slick , Chisholm ? Do n't do it . " " I 'm not being slick . Yesterday , when I met Miss Raffray here at the tennis court and she asked me if I had talked with Storrs , I did n't happen to feel like explainingthat I had found him sound asleep and had n't disturbed him , so I just said I had n't found him . Later , when Miss Bonner asked me the same question , naturally I told her the same thing , and others heard me . And when you asked me last night , it did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of explaining . I would n't call that slick  --  the fact is , it was pretty dumb  --  look at me now , yelling for you to let me up " " And that is the only reason you give , that flimsy excuse , for telling a deliberate lie , on a vital point , to the authorities investigating the murder of a man whose life you had threatened on the very day he was killed ? " Len nodded . " Yeah , that 's the only one . You framed that question swell . I told you it was n't much good . " " You have nothing to add to it ? " " Not a thing . I 'll play it like that . " " And your story now is , that you saw Storrs there , inp110that spot where he was found dead , and he was on the bench asleep ? " " That 's it . What I told you yesterday was correct , except for seeing Storrs . I left Foltz 's place a little before4:30 and came here by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Storrs and smooth him down and maybe get the job back which he had got me fired from . The butler told me he had left the house . I looked around the front gardens and then remembered Miss Raffray had told me that he often took a nap in that place down by the fish pool , and I went there . He was there on the bench , dead to the world  --  I mean he was asleep . I went up within a few feet of him , and decided not to wake him up because he would probably be in a bad humor if I did . I looked at my watch because I was thinking vaguely of getting someone to drive me to Ogowoc , to catch a train to New York , and it was twenty minutes to five . I came back up the hill and around the front of the house and met Miss Raffray  --  she had just come over from Foltz 's  --  and she suggested some ten-nis . " Sherwood was studying him . " Storrs lying there asleep  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed a wire under his neck without disturbing him ? " " I do n't know . I did n't try . " " Did you have any gloves with you ? " " No . " " Did you go to the garden house ? " " No . " " Did you know there was a reel of trellis wire in the garden house ? "   " I did n't knwo anything about garden house , or if I did , I was n't thinking about it . I do n't know this place very well ; I 've only been here a few times . " " Which way was Storrs ' head pointing ? " " To the right  --  my right as I faced the bench . " " Did you see the piece of paper on the grass ? " " Huh ?  --  Oh . No , you would n't set a trap , wouldyou ? Anyway , I did n't see it . " " I was n't setting a trap . Was the paper in his hand ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything else  --  notice anything ? Is this your whole story this time ? " " That 's it . You 've got it all . This time and any other time . " " Not last night . " " Okay . I asked for that one . " Sherwood sat a moment , pulling at the lobe of his ear , without taking his eyes from Chisholm . At length he resumed , " About that threat of yours yesterday morningagainst Storrs . You 're pretty hot-tempered ? " Len said drily , " Yeah , I 'm emotional . I get worked up . You mean I might get mad enough at a man to kill him ? Not if he was asleep . He 'd have to wake up first . " " I suppose he would . But about that threat . I 'm aware that men talk like that all the time , but this time there was a curious coincidence . You did n't say you would kill Storrs , or shoot him , or poison him ; you said you 'd strangle him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I would if I could . " Len frowned . " Maybe it was112 THE HAND IN THE GLOVEp112because I did strangle a man once  --  in a play I was in at college . Only I did n't use wire , I did it with my fingers .  --  Look here  --  your name 's Sherwood ? There 's no sense in going on with this till you get me sore . This junk about me threatening Storrs . If you get me sore and I blow up , what good does that do you ? I walk out on you , and then what ? " The attorney purred at him , " You wo n't walk far , Chisholm . No one here will leave these grounds , for the present . That 's understood . As for your getting sore , I 'm investigating a murder , you did utter that threat , you did lie to me last night , and you were , by your own statement , the last person to see Storrs alive . I 'm not prepared to accuse you of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you to get an attorney . But I do n't believe you want to refuse to answer questions . Do you ? " Len muttered , " I 'll answer questions . But quit reminding me that I said I 'd strangle Storrs . I know damn well I said it , but I did n't do it . What do you want to know ? " " I want to know everything . " Sherwood looked around again , surveying each face . " I wish all of you would realize one thing . If the murderer is among you , I 'm not expecting anything from him  --  or her . But for the rest of you , you ought to understand that if I knew for certain what each one of you was thinking and doing yesterday afternoon between 3:30 and 6:15 , that would tell me who the guilty one was . I say 6:15 , because from that time on you were all together at the tennis court , until Miss Bonner left . I say 3:30 , because at that hour Storrs was seen by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minutes later he was seen by the assistant gardener . If we accept Chisholm 's story as he tells it , we know that Storrs was alive at 4:40 , and we substitute that for the 3:30 . That would mean that Storrs was killed during the 95 minutes between 4:40 and 6:15 . All right ; what led up to it ? What were the actions and thoughts of all of you who were innocent during that period ? " Sherwood suddenly shot out a hand and pointed at the face of Steven Zimmerman . " Take you ! You appeared at the tennis court at 5:45 . What had you been doing during the preceding hour ? You say , walking in the woods , and I ca n't disprove it . But what were you doing yesterday morning in Storrs ' private office ? You were n't walking in the woods then , were you ? You have refused to tell me . If you 're a murderer I would n't expect you to tell me , though I might suppose you would furnish some explanation instead of a flat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ justify your silence  --  to me , to yourself , to society  --  to God ? I am the prosecuting attorney of this county ; I represent the law ; but I also represent P. L. Storrs and his dependence on the law to defend his life and to avenge his death . Can any of you say "  --  Sherwood circled with his outstretched hand , his pointing finger  --  " can any one of you , except the one who killed him , say that Storrs deserved to have his murderer shielded from the law ? " The attorneypaused . He leaned back in his chair . " Well . Any one of you who lies or evades or withholds information regarding what happened here yesterday , or elsewhere as a pre/liminary to yesterday , you are shielding the guilt of a murderer , whether that is your intention or not . I hope I make that clear ? " He surveyed the circle again , meetingeach pair of eyes , none refusing him , then abruptly returned to Chisholm : " You say you 'll answer questions . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and also at everyone else . What about ? " Len grimaced . " Different reasons . You want me to go down the list ? It 's an empty haul , but you can have it . I was sore at Storrs because he had got me bounced . I was sore at my boss because he had n't given me two weeks ' pay . I was sore at Miss Raff ray because she had let Storrs bully her into ditching Miss Bonner , and also because she was using me to badger Foltz and she thought I was too dumb to know it . I was sore at Foltz because he was jackass enough to let her work it , and anyway , he and I are n't compatible , he thinks life is beautiful and I 'm a pessimist . I was sore at Miss Bonner because she had stayed in New York . I was sore at myselfbecause I had come out here without Miss Bonner , since the only reason I have anything to do with these people is because they are her friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you any to know it , I would have been sore at the rest of this bunch too if I had happened to think of them . " Sherwood nodded . " You said your anger was universal . It sounds like it . Why were you thinking of taking a train to New York , since Miss Bonner was coming at six o'clock ? " " I did n't know she was coming . She had said she wasn't. "  | " When she arrived , did she say why she had changed her mind ? " Len 's eyes flickered . " She 's right there , ask her . " Dol 's voice came : " Do n't be silly , Len , tell him . " " Okay . She said P. L. Storrs had phoned her an invitation . " ti " Did she say Storrs had come to her office ? " " Not that I remember , no . I did n't have my notebook . I was n't a newspaper man any more . " " No . You had been fired . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come out here without Miss Bonner . Are you an old friend of hers ? " " Fairly old . " Len looked across to where Dol sat close to Sylvia , Sylvia 's hand in hers , and blinked at the sun which was in the window behind them . He squinted at the attorney : " I am in love with Miss Bonner . I am trying to persuade her that she is in love with me . " He paused , and finished with a growl , " She is the only woman I have ever cared for . Ask me that question again next year , and I 'll answer it the same way . " " I doubt if I 'll be asking you questions next year . I hope not . Since you were sore at everybody , why did you come out here without Miss Bonner ? " " I 've told you that . Miss Raffray suggested that I come and wheedle Storrs . I wanted my job back . " " It was not your declared intention to wheedle . Was it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Len had a palm up at him . " I told you to quit reminding me that I threatened to strangle Storrs . And I 'm also telling you , the longer you spend fooling with me , the colder you get . I 've let you go on only be- cause I lied to you last night and I thought I ought to make it up to you . " Sherwood 's reply was forestalled by Brissenden . The colonel leaned across the table toward the attorney and demanded , " Let me have him a while . I 'd like to try something . " The reply to that was also interrupted . There was a knock at the door and a trooper entered  --  the one with a flat nose to whom , the evening before , Dol had demonstratedthe significance of the wire spiraled around the tree . At a nod from Sherwood he advanced , and placed on the table , diplomatically between the attorney and his own superior officer , an astonishing array of loot . It was a flat market basket filled with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and women 's . Brissenden glared at it and muttered , " What the devil ! " The trooper told him : " There they are , sir . Those at this end are from the servants ' rooms . The others all belong to members of the family , except two pairs  --  they 're all tagged  --  we found in the closet of the front hall , which the butler and the maid ca n't identify . None of them was used to pull that wire ; there 's some riding gloves with marks , but not the kind the wire made . The boys are finishing upstairs  --  there 's a few things , bags and chests , the butlercould n't unlock . What 'll I do , let ' em go ? " Brissenden grunted bitterly , " Mr. Sherwood is in charge . " The attorney said , " No , I think . . . " He fingered gingerly at the display . " If you 've examined all these  --  perhaps the colonel would like to go over them  --  they might as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Would you be willing , madam , to unlock the bags and chests and remain to lock them again ? Or your daughter perhaps ? I think it is our duty to make this search as thorough as possible . " Mrs. Storrs sat unmoving . She declared , " It is useless . I warned you  --  the proof of fools  --  I will do it , but it is useless . I have heard all this foolishness . Do you think to entrap Siva with a pair of gloves ? What are paltry facts to his wisdom , when he creates facts ? What are the hands of a watch or the eyes of a foolish youth ? I know the cycle has been closed ! " Sherwood nodded impatiently . " All right , Mrs. Storrs . You leave it to us . We are aware that the cycle could have been closed after 4:4o as well as before , even fools like us . If you will just go with the sergeant and unlock those things . .. and Quill ! Has de Roode come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Send him in , and then I want to see that assistant gardener .  --  Yes . " He looked at Len . " Colonel Brissenden would like to speak with you  --  will you go to that next room with him ? " Len lifted his shoulders and dropped them . " He 'll only bark at me , and I 'll bark back . " " Will you go ? " " Sure . I 'll control myself . " Sherwood turned again . " I 'd like to see you , Mr. Zimmerman , in about half an hour . Please stay within call , and I 'll send for you . " Another turn : " You may go to your home , Mr. Foltz , if you wish , but no further , please , for the present . I would like to talk with you later .  --  The rest of you will please remain on these1p118grounds , I do n't know how long  --  oh , and Quill ! Tell those reporters I 've changed my mind and get them off the place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office .  --  If you do n't mind , Mrs. Storrs ? "  | DOL BONNER had n't slept much , and she had a headache . In the friendly sunny September morning she walked along the path skirting the top of the east slope , thinking that outdoors she might breathe the headache away . The evening before , she had eaten nothing ; this morning she had been starved and had breakfasted on two enormous peaches from the Birchhaven orchard , cereal , finnan haddie , rolls and coffee . While at the coffee she had been summoned to the card room by Sherwood , without a chance to step to the terrace to look at the sun . Now she walked in it , but it only glared at her and made her head ache worse . She was proceeding on the assumption that she was a detective . She had in fact come to Birchhaven in that role , hired by P. L. Storrs , and even if she had been more strongly inclined to abandon it than she was , her obstinacywould probably have prevented her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attractive young woman  --  for her self-assurance had not been so mortally injured that she denied an obvious mirrored fact  --  undertaking such a career , but since the first week in the office of Bonner &; Raffray it had not been prominentin her thoughts . She was a pretty good realist , and it was obvious that she must either seriously endeavor to establish herself in the profession she had chosen , or be prepared to admit to herself that she was a phony . I19p12o The latter , for Dol Bonner , was not likely . So she had attacked earnestly and energetically the problems that had been presented to her for solution , even the messy affair of Lili Lombard and Harold Ives Beaton . Now here she was , up to her neck in a murder case . Not her case , but she was in it . Strolling along the path , passing a large and luxuriant clump of cotoneaster , her eye was arrested by an impression of something dead brown in color , a color not appropriate to live twigs and green leaves  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stepped off the path and pushed the cotoneaster branches aside to get a look , and saw that the object was an abandoned bird 's nest . She became aware that so simple an incident had made her pulse jump up , and she sneered delicately at herself . So ! Without really being conscious of it , she was looking for a pair of gloves , was she ? That was a likely enterprise , among all these acres , even for the throng of troopers and detectives on the job , let alone for one woman . Not that she disapproved the effort from a professionalstandpoint ; it was clearly worth trying , no matter how hopeless it seemed . She decided to see what the nook and the tree looked like in broad daylight , and headed down the slope . But , arriving there , she did not actually enter the nook ; first , because a trooper was standing at the entrance , by the low-hanging dogwood branches , chewing gum and obviously a Cerberus ; and second , because her attention was caught elsewhere . Voices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moving around there . She approached , ventured further and stood where thep121water-line had been , and no one gave her any notice , because they were engrossed in their task and the curioussight it afforded . The pool had been completely drained , to the bottom , and thousands of fish , mostly blue-gill and perch , were flopping frantically about , while men with rakes worked their way through the muck and mire , sweating , grunting , calling sarcastic encouragement back and forth . On the opposite bank stood a gray-haired man in faded blue overalls , looking distressed and indignant as he puffed spasmodically at his pipe  --  Watrous , the Birchhaven head gardener . Dol went away , back up the slope , reflecting that it had occurred to someone besides her that it would have been simple for the murderer to stick a stone into each glove and toss them into the pool . But my lord , what a job ! Also , the outdoor housekeeping at Birchhaven was impeccable , and there really were no small stones lying around loose , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere else quickly you have n't time to hunt around much  --  unless you have provided yourself with stones or weights beforehand , which did n't seem likely . Passing the elaborate and extensive rose garden , she saw that two men with dark suits and black derbies were in there , armed with spades , crouching and darting around , presumably looking for evidence of recently overturned soil . She went on to the stable , told a man there good morning , and received his permission to pat the horses , one of which she had several times bestrode . From the loft above came gruff voices and grunts and the sound of men forking hay and  --  she listened  --  ap-pI22parently pawing at it . She muttered , " Needle in a haystack , " and sought the sunshine again . Retracing her steps , she turned aside through the gap in the yew hedge to the vegetable garden , and walked along the central path of turf . She thought she saw evidence of a search here too  --  celery tiles crooked , watermelon vines trampled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one around . She continued to the far border , where there were low brick-walled compartments for compost heaps , and stood looking at the conglomeratemass ready for decay on the heap most recently begun : corn husks , spoiled tomatoes , cabbage leaves and roots , celery tops , carrot tops , a little pile of watermelon meat , faint pink and unripe . . . . She thought , " So recently living and growing , and now no good for anything until it rots . . . . " She put her hands to her temples and pressed ; apparently the sun was n't going to help her head any . She went back to the house . In the reception hall , Sergeant Quill appeared from somewhere and put himself in her path : " Oh , Miss Bonner , I 've been looking for you . The back of your car 's locked . If you do n't mind . . . " " What ? " Dol 's brain slowed up when her head ached . " Oh , of course . The key @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . I saw it there , but it would be better if you 'd come along . " Dol shrugged , and followed him out of the house , across the main terrace , and onto the graveled space . He opened the door of her coupe and stood back , and shep123opened the dashboard compartment and fished out the key and gave it to him . Around at the back , she stood and watched him as he unlocked the panel and raised it and began pulling things out . There was a sweater , a kodak , two tennis balls , a leather jacket of Sylvia 's , a copy of a book by Ogden Nash and one of the third volumeof Gibbon 's Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire . . . then the trooper brought forth a leather case , not large but handsome and sturdy , of light pigskin with chromium hinges and clasps , with " T. B. " stamped in gold beneath the handle . Not wanting to scratch it on the gravel , he rested it on the sweater to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ herself blushing and could do nothing about it . Immediately disclosed , strapped to the under side of the lid , was a little blue-metal Holcomb automaticpistol and a box of cartridges . The trooper said solemnly , " Of course you 're a de-tective . " Dol snapped , " I have a license . I mean for that gun . " He nodded and examined further . As his eye took in the significance of the case 's contents , he muttered admiringly , " By golly , quite an outfit . " Dol felt sure that in another minute she would kick him . That case was not Bonner &; Raffray property , it was her own , a gift from Sylvia , who had taken the trouble to meet and consultwith two New York inspectors of police in order to determine what it should hold . Possibly Sylvia had overdone it a little , but that was her way . . The trooper was observing , " Tannic  --  muriatic -- -three magnifying glasses in there  --  fingerprint powders , squirters , pads  --  yep , litmus paper  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never can tell when you might need one  --  gauze and tape  --  say , that flashlight 's a pippin  --  " He looked up at her : " But that gat  --  of course it 's all right to keep it here ordinarily , but I should think you ought to have it right on you when you 're on a murder case like this  --  " Dol said , " Put the key back when you 're through , " and left him . She thought to herself , as she sought the winding walk to the tennis court , that the annoying little incident was without significance , since she already dislikedmen to the limit of her capacity . She tossed it off . In two bright yellow chairs near a corner of the tennis court sat Martin Foltz and Sylvia Raffray . As Dol approached Sylvia sat leaning back , with her hands up covering her eyes , and Martin was talking with a man who stood before his chair looking down at him . The man presented a rather singular appearance . If you looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been far-fetched to say that you saw an enormous ape in a suit of clothes and shoes ; it was an inescapable impression from broad shoulders slumpingto dominate the chest , the hips stuck onto the trunk like a mammoth jointed doll , the hang of all the musclesgiving you the feeling that uprightness was a strain . Then , looking up , you were startled to see the uneasy , enigmatic , intelligent face and eyes of a sensitive and sapient man , around sixty years old . The way his shouldersslumped , he was not much taller than Martin Foltz . Martin interrupted his talk with the man : " Here'sp125Dol , Sylvia.  --  I 'm glad you came , Dol . De Roode wants to ask you about that man you sent down  --  " " Dol darling , you 're a bum . " Sylvia had uncovered her eyes and sat up . Her eyes looked deep , her gay aggressivenesswas gone , and there was gray in the accustomedloveliness of her skin . " You are always going off . What the dickens are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulder and looked into her face . " I 'm having a headache , that 's all . I suppose we all are . " She straightened up , and around to Martin . " You mean Silky Pratt watching the pheasants . I thought of him last night . It seemed  --  I do n't know  --  ridiculous . Did he come , de Roode ? Did you get him at Ogowoc ? " The man nodded . " Yes , miss . " His voice was husky and guttural . " I could n't sneak him into my attic like I was supposed to , because when I got back with him there was police there  --  from here  --  and they had the men , talking to them . They questioned your man too , and of course they questioned me . He spent the night watching anyhow . I told him you 'd let him know today . It seems sort of useless , since everybody knows about it . " " I suppose so . " Dol 's forehead was wrinkled . " What do you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I do n't know . . . since you said you would n't let me pay for it . . . " " You mean it 's my money we 're wasting . Or rather , Sylvia 's . All right , I say go ahead . I know we all feel right now that we 're in an earthquake , but if we 've started a job we ought to go on with it . " She looked atp126de Roode . " I 'll phone him to come tonight . Meet him at Ogowoc on the same train . " Sylvia burst out , " Dol , it 's so silly ! After what 's happened . . . a man sitting there all night watching those pheasants . . . . " She stopped , then abruptly went on , " Anyway , there 's no sense in it . Martin and I mention edit this morning , and we 're going to get rid of them right away . " De Roode muttered , " That remains to be seen , Miss Raff ray . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at him . " There 's been enough of this foolishness , de Roode . You 're too darned stubborn . Martin 's a nervous wreck . Oh , I know you 've been in the family fifty years , or maybe a hundred , and you rode Martin piggy-back , and you 'd give both arms to save him from a bad cold , and you hate me , but if you like those pheasants you 'd better go off with them somewhere . " " I do n't hate you , Miss Raffray . " The man 's face twitched . " But you 're very young , and it 's not my duty to let you interfere  --  " " De Roode ! " " Yes , Mr. Martin . " " Do n't argue with Miss Raffray . " " Yes , sir . " A tremor , just perceptible , ran over the man 's frame , then he was still . " I did n't start it , sir . " Sylvia insisted , " You did start it . You said it remains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It 's decided . " " Yes , Miss Raffray.  --  Is it decided , sir ? " " Suffering saints ! " Martin threw up both hands. i " You get . Beat it . Go on home . I 'll have a talk with you later . " De Roode moved only his eyes , to Dol . " And about the man , Miss Bonner . Am I to get him tonight ? " Dol said , " Yes , until further notice . I can let you know . " De Roode turned and went , without celerity , but with no retardation of age in the power of his great muscles . Dol looked at his back as it receded  --  his sinewy rounded shoulders , the smooth vigorous swing of his legs . She said to anyone , " He 's a strange beast , that man . " And to Foltz , " If I were you , Martin , I 'd send him away at the same time as the pheasants . He is obviously so insanely jealous of Sylvia they could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worse all the time . " She shrugged . " He has idolized you long enough anyhow , he should have a vacation . " She sat down on the footrest of Sylvia 's chair . " Well , Raffray , what about it ? How goes it ? " She patted Sylvia 's ankle . " Rotten , thank you , Bonner . " " I suppose so . You 're young , and you were just a kid when your mother and father went , and this is the first real sock life has handed you . " " It is n't only that . " Sylvia drew a long deep breath , with a trembling catch at the end of it . " P.L. was a swell guy and . . . you know what he was to me . . . and it 's awful that he 's dead . " She bit at her . lip , looked down at her twisting fingers , looked at Dol . " But this is worse than awful . " She bit at her lip again , then suddenlyburst @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him ?  | Why do n't they take him away from here ? Why do n't they let us go ? I hate this place ! " Martin leaned to her : " Now Sylvia . Do n't do that . " Dol said , rubbing Sylvia 's ankle , " You 're a spoiled child . So was I , once . Even you , you have to learn you ca n't just snap your fingers . There are some doses you have to swallow even if you are fortune 's darling . I swallowed one and darned near choked on it . " " But dragging it out like this  --  making us sit there and listen to him  --  and to that crazy woman  --  " Dol shook her head . " You 're taking too much for granted . They do not know that Ranth did it . Even if they knew it  --  " " Of course they do ! Who else could ? Of course they know ! " " No , Sylvia dear . " Dol was gentle . " They do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prefer Ranth on account of motive , but as it stands now , after what Len said , they have n't a particle of evidence . And there 's a strong point in Ranth 's favor : if he went back there after 4:40 , and did it , surely he would n't have left that paper there on the grass . It 's possible , he might have gone off in a panic , but it is n't likely . " Sylvia was staring at her . " But . . . I supposed of course it was him . If it was n't him . . . " " That 's just it , " Dol agreed . " If it was n't him . It might have been somebody we never heard of , but Sherwoodis convinced it was n't . It might have been you or me or Janet or Mrs. Storrs , but he thinks it was n't a woman . It might have been Len , losing his head , or Martin , mistaking him for a rival , or Steve , to observe .  |p129a  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm not talkingjust to hear myself or to pile anything on . I did n't come here as your guest , either , it was P. L. Storrs who invited me . " Dol abruptly switched to Foltz . " What do you think , Martin ? Have you got any more opinions than you had last night ? " " No . I have n't . " Martin slowly shook his head . " I guess there 's nothing very rugged about my nerves , but I ca n't help it . Last night I was so shocked I was n't capableof doing any thinking . When those troopers wanted me to go down there and look . . . look at P.L. . . . and I did n't want to go , they actually got suspicious , but I could n't help that either . I 've got too much imagination . . . I did n't need to go there to see it . " He put up his hands and pressed his fingers against his eyelids , then looked at Dol again . " I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more manly . " Sylvia fluttered a hand at him . " Please , Martin . You are you . Such as you are , you are mine . " He gazed at her and muttered , " God knows I am . " Doi , not caring for love manifestations with a certainpoignant memory still too acute , put in brusquely , " And such as you are , I 'd like to ask you a couple of questions . May I ? " " You mean me ? " Martin 's gaze left Sylvia reluctantly . " Both of you . You first . What happened over at your place yesterday ? " " What happened ? " Martin 's brow folded . " Why , nothing . We played a little tennis . . . . " " Something must have happened , to make you comep130over here through the woods in groups of one , at lengthy intervals . Sylvia told me that Len misbehaved . Len said that Sylvia was badgering you and you were a jackass.  --  But wait , I suppose I ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I am investigating the murder of P. L. Storrs . " Sylvia stared at her in astonishment . Martin stammered , " Why . . . of course . If you want to know  --  " Sylvia interrupted him : " Do n't humor her , Martin . She 's wonderful and I love her , but she is a prima donna .  --  Doi Bonner , this is n't  --  it is not in good taste . " " On the contrary , " Dol declared calmly , " it is . I merely did n't want Martin to misunderstand and think he was speaking under the protection of private confidence , which naturally I could n't betray . But I would like to know what happened over there yesterday . " " It is still bad taste . What happened there has nothing to do with P.L. 's death . " " All right , forget it . " Dol abruptly rose to her feet . " Do n't think I 'm grandstanding , Sylvia . The firm of Bonner &; Raffray , which is not yet dissolved , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like it , I 'm sorry . About yesterday , I can ask Len Chisholm . " She moved to go . " Wait a minute , Dol . " Martin groaned . " My god , you girls ! What 's the difference whether it 's friendly curiosity or what it is ? Nothing happened yesterday except that I suppose we all made fools of ourselves . We got to my place around three o'clock . I had forgotten about Steve , and he was already there when we arrived , and he was grouchy and I spent half an hour smoothingp131him down . When I finally went outdoors I suppose Sylvia had decided I was neglecting her , and she undertook to teach me a lesson by pretending there was no one there but Len Chisholm . I suppose I showed that I did n't enjoy being taught , and Len made some remarks , and I also made some . Len blew up a little , and left , headed for the path over here . Then Sylvia and I went at it  --  and I may say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too . I sulked a little while , and looked around for Steve and could n't find him , and then I came over here too . I heard Sylvia and Len on the tennis court and did n't care to join them , so I went around by the evergreens and got to the house from the south , the sun room , and went to the dining-room and had a drink . Belden came in and told me there were supplies at the tennis court , and I could n't stay away anyhow , so I came out and sat in that blue chair  --  that one  --  and had another drink , and I was still there when you showed up . " Dol nodded . " And Steve was there too . " " Not when I got there . He came a few minutes later . That must have been about a quarter of an hour before you came . " " What was Steve grouchy about when you got to your place yesterday and he was already there ? If you want to tell me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's touchy . He thought I had forgotten he was coming , and I had . " " Did he say anything about his visit yesterday morning to Storrs ' office ? " " No , he did n't mention it . I had intended to ask him about it , because I could n't imagine what he had gone there for , but in the  --  the confusion  --  I forgot about it . " " What time yesterday did you get here to the tennis court ? " " I do n't know . It must have been , I would say , about twenty minutes before you did . " " That was six o'clock . So you got here about 5:40 . " " I suppose around that . " " Did you stop anywhere on the way ? In the evergreensfor instance , to listen to the gayety from the tennis court ? " Martin colored a little . " I may have stood there a minute or two . " " And you went to the house and got a drink . Then  --  let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 5:15 or 5:20 . Where was de Roode when you left there ? Did you see him ? " " De Roode ? " Martin looked surprised . " Why de Roode ? " " I 'm just asking . " " Well , I suppose he was around . They feed at 5:30 . I did n't see him . " Dol kept her eyes obliquely down at Martin 's face , and stood , silent . Finally she spoke : " Thanks , Martin , for indulging me . I hope it turns out to be Ranth . It was hardly you . Len  --  I ca n't see Len . If it was Steve Zimmerman or de Roode , that would hit you , and if I can find generosity to wish any man on earth peace and happiness it will be you , for Sylvia to share it . " She compressed her lips and took a slow breath , and looked down at the junior partner of Bonner &; Raffray . " It would n't hurt you , Sylvia dear , to indulge me too , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to know about yesterday morning : did Steve Zimmerman or Storrs , either one , tell you what their talk had been about ? " Sylvia gazed up into the caramel-colored eyes , biting her lip . She extended a hand and let it fall again . " Dol . . . tell me . Are you just doing this ? What are you doing ? You ca n't make a game . . . asking these questionsabout all of us . . . . " " I 'm not making a game . I 'm working . " Dol suddenlystepped forward , leaned down to put her hands on Sylvia 's knees , and looked into Sylvia 's face . " You poor kid . Damn it , I know . Everything hurts you worse because you 've never been hurt before . And me  --  I 'm me , that 's all . If I 'm adding to your hurt by making a job of it , I 'll go and sit on the terrace and read about the Roman Empire . I 'll let it alone  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , made her back straight . " No . " Sylvia shook her head . " It is n't what I want  --  I want you to do whatever you think you ought to do . " " Okay . That 's the girl . I think I ought to ask you to answer that question  --  whether Steve or Storrs told you  --  " " They did n't . " " But you said Steve spoke about a mortal injury . " " He did , but I thought he was just maundering . He did n't say anything specific . " " And Storrs did n't either ? " " No . " Sylvia frowned . " It all seems cloudy now . It seems a year ago . . . . " Dol nodded . " All right . I hope it 's Ranth . " She pressed her palms to her temples . " I 'm going to thei house and find some aspirin . I 'm going to find a hat too , or stay out of the sun . " She turned to Martin : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come tonight . Maybe we can try again later , if you still have the pheasants . " Martin agreed that that would probably be best , and Sylvia expressed concern about the headache , then , as Dol moved off , leaned her head against the back of the chair again and shut her eyes . Martin sat and looked at her . . . .  | CROSSING the main terrace to enter the house again , Dol saw that the door as being opened for her by a trooper in uniform . So they were even usurping the domestic functions . Inside , in the reception hall , stood another trooper , apparently for adornment . She supposed that the movements of everybody were being kept more or less under observation , and that exasperatedher until she realized , with a little shock , that she would like to do the same thing herself . She moved around the obstruction of the broad staircaseand stood looking at the closed door to the card room , from behind which came an indistinct murmur of voices . She frowned at hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from irritation at something that was eluding her memory . It was like a face which she could remember without being able to fit a name to it ; a fact that she wanted , and knew was in her mind , but could not get hold of . She felt that it was trivial and yet might be important ; something she had that morning seen or heard or felt which had struck her , below the surface of consciousness , as a contradiction or incongruity which needed to be explained ; and she had at the momentfailed to call it up for examination , and now could not find where it was hid , in some secluded recess of her mind . It was something someone had said . . . or a gesture not apropos . . . or some object she had seen . . . . She gave it up , knowing it would return to plague her ; and heard , behind her , her name pronounced . It was Belden , bowing , with slips of paper in his hand . There had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the predicament at Birchhaven through the newspapers , wished to know if he could be of any service to her . She could get him at his apartment until noon , after that at the Biscuit Club . Miss Eldora Oliver . . . a similar message . Mr. Malcolm Brown wanted Miss Bonner to know that he was at his place near Westport for the weekend , and that he could drive to Birchhaven in twenty minutes . Dol thanked Belden and asked him if there was a phone available  --  since the only one she knew of was in the card room  --  and was conducted by him to the pantry . She consulted a memo book from her handbag for Silky Pratt 's number , got him , and told him to forget about the pheasants for the present and to join Gil Delk in the search for Anita Gifford 's dress . She returned to the reception hall frowning again . What the dickens was it she was trying to remember ? What measly little fact was eluding her ? She tossed her head in exasperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition to be tossed  --  and mounted the stairs . The wide upstairs corridor was intersected at its middleby a narrower one . Around the corner , at the first door on the right , Dol stopped and tapped softly on the panel . After a little wait she tapped again ; then itp137opened and Janet Storrs was confronting her . Janet , as Dol had observed previously , either felt no grief at her father 's death , or grief was not with her a matter for tears and lamentations ; rather , she had withdrawn from it , or with it , there was no telling which ; her surface had frozen into a pale mask , and the blood flowed beneathwith its secrets . Her gray eyes slept or smouldered as they had before . Dol said , " I wanted to see Mrs. Storrs . Just for a minute . " Before the other could reply a voice sounded from within : " Who is it ? " " It 's Dol Bonner , Mother . " " Let her in . " Janet stepped aside and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazement . The sight that met her eyes was not really extraordinary . . . or was it ? Mrs. Storrs , bare-armed and bare-legged , dressed only in an athletic jersey and shorts , stood on the platform of a complicated exercising machine , grasping the rubber handles . She was not young nor slender , but neither was she unwieldy or misshapen . Disregarding , or not seeing , Dol. ' s open-mouthed surprise , she spoke in her normal voice , which always in its first sentence startled by its intensity : " I have not missed doing this in three years , but this morning I did n't feel like it . After that . . . downstairs . . . I came up and lay down , but I could n't lie still . Do you want something , my dear ? " Dol was impelled to leave the room without a word . The woman was manifestly crazy ; at the very least ,  | simple-minded . She abandoned as useless the questions she had intended to ask , but there was nevertheless something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's nothing I want , thank you , Mrs. Storrs , but there are two things I thought I should tell you . First , I am not here as Sylvia 's guest . Mr. Storrs asked me to come . He engaged me , hired me , to discredit Mr. Ranth . To get rid of him . I have told the men downstairs about it , so I thought I should tell you . " Janet stood there motionless , looking on , no change on her frozen surface . Mrs. Storrs said , as calmly as the compression of her vocal chamber would permit : " Thank you , my dear . My husband would do that . I understood my husband . It is of no consequence . He acted in his sphere , and by his death I am confined to it . " Dol hastily agreed . " Yes . It 's too bad you could n't  --  " She checked herself . " The other thing I wanted to say : I am staying in your house , of course , because I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor a friend . I am investigating the murder of your husband . " Janet faintly stirred , then was motionless again . Mrs. Storrs released the rubber handles and declared , " That sounds foolish . What is there to investigate about it ? " " Several things . For one  --  who killed him ? " " Nonsense . " Mrs. Storrs stepped from the platform . " Who are you ? What can you know ? I have told that man . . . he says he looks for proof . Do you mean you help him ? Do so , my dear , but do you know what Siva says ? The camel leaves a track , the sun does not . I could show him the truth , but I could not imprison it for him . "  |p139Dol  only half heard her . She was thinking that anyone who could stand there in linen shorts with a Saks label showing , and talk like that , was either a mahatma or plain dotty ; and that , at the moment , was not the dilemma that engaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question which might be favored with an intelligible answer . She asked it : " If you do n't mind , Mrs. Storrs , there 's one thing I would like to know . Ranth came back to the house at 4:20 and told you Mr. Storrs had kept that paper . Was he with you from then on ? All the rest of the afternoon ? " " No . " " How long did he stay with you ? " " Ten minutes . Perhaps fifteen . " " Do you know where he went ? " " Yes . If Leonard Chisholm , as he says , saw my husbandalive . He went back to my husband . " " Did he say he was going there ? " " No . " " Did you see him go ? " " No . He said he was going to the card room , to write a letter . " " Was Janet here with you ? " " No . She left long before that , when my husband did . " Janet put in , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at others almost a squeak : " I gatheredc flowers and put them in vases . Then I went to thegarden and read there in the pergola . Because myher is strong , do you have to torment her like this ?  |p140Or  me ? When you have forfeited your right to courtesy . . . " " I know I have . Courtesy is no good anyway , just at present . " Dol sounded firm , but not unpleasant . " Would you mind telling me  --  while you were outdoors , and in the rose garden , did you see anyone going toward the fish pool or away from it ? Len Chisholm , for instance ? " " I saw no one anywhere . " " Okay .  --  And Mrs. Storrs . Please . You came with Mr. Ranth to the tennis court a little after six o'clock . Had he rejoined you ? " " No . When I went downstairs at six he was on the terrace , the side terrace . We went together to the tennis court . " " Were you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my husband . " Dol gasped . " You were what ? When ? " " I was with my husband when he left the house . I was with him as he slept , and after he was destroyed . I am with him now . " " Yes . Of course . " Dol felt uncomfortably that crazy or not , the wretched woman was pitiable . Standing there in her linen shorts , her bare arms and legs . . . what had Storrs said . . . sticking her nose in the cosmos . Dol said abruptly , " Thank you both , very much . I hope I will be able to show that I am not merely a nuisance . " She turned and left the room . Descending the stairs , she reproached herself for not having made one small demand of courtesy and asked Janet for some kind of a hat . Her own turban was uselessin the bright sun , and she did want one . She askedp141the trooper in the reception hall where the butler was , found him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side hall beyond the dining-room . There she found a shelf of floppy straws and cotton helmets , picked a decent fit , and proceeded to the side terrace . She had learned from the trooper that Ranth was in the card room , and that Zimmerman had emerged from it a few minutes ago and had left the house . She had decided to tackle Zimmerman . It proved to be her most dismal failure of the morning . The assistant professor of psychology was indeed to be found , but he might as well not have been . After wandering in the grounds on two sides of the house and thinking it as well not to make inquiry of a trooper on the main driveway and another who looked down on her from the roof of the summer kitchen , heaven knew why , she finally ran across Zimmerman out at the kennels . He was seated on an upturned box , staring through the wire netting at a Doberman lying with his head on his paws and blinking in the sun . He offered no greeting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped within a yard of him . She stood , also silent , and gazed through the netting at the dog . Finally she said , " His name is on that plate there . Gulken Prince Birch . " No response . Continued silence . Dol swallowed exasperationand turned on him : " Steve Zimmerman . You 're a darned fool . Either what you and Storrs talked about yesterday morning is connected with his murder , or it is n't . If it is n't , you ought to tell it . If it is , and you wo n't tell it , you should have made up something to tell that man Sherwood . You do n't seem to realize that Sherwoodcan do really unpleasant things . He can lock you up as a material witness , and keep you locked up . He can make you notorious . He knows that just after you left Storrs you said something to Sylvia Raffray about a mortal injury . Now I want to tell you , I 'm in on this . I am investigating Storrs ' murder . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something that you ca n't disclose , but had nothing to do with his death , and if you wo n't tell Sherwood because you think you ca n't trust him to keep it confidential , you can trust me . That would do until the inquest Tuesday . At the inquest is when you 'll really get it . You 'll testify or you 'll get it .  --  But maybe I 'm talking too fast . You 've just been in there with Sherwood . Maybe you told him about it . Did you ? " Slowly Zimmerman 's head turned , tilted , and he looked up to meet her gaze . His thin stringy hair was lifeless in the sun , his wide nostrils looked permanently distended , and his pale eyes , no longer inquisitive , gave the impression that they saw nothing whatever and did not expect to . They remained fixed on Dol a moment , then abandoned her and went back to the dog . He said , in a tone devoid of any concern in the matter , " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . I told Sherwood nothing about my talk with Mr. Storrs . Nor will I tell you . Or anyone else . " " Sooner or later you will . You 'll have to . " Zimmerman shook his head . " No , I wo n't . " He spoke without animation , with dead finality . " The human mind has given countless proofs of its capacity for resolution . I shall betray nothing that I choose to conceal ,  |p143unless  I change my resolution . It is my own affair whether I act for my own defense , or as a shield either for innocence or for guilt , or merely from caprice . It is psychologically fascinating , but I am not enjoying it . I told Sherwood that . " " Good lord . " Dol stared at his profile . " You are a fool . " " No , I 'm not a fool . " Zimmerman picked up a crumb of biscuit which lay on the gravel and tossed it through the netting . The dog eyed it , and decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I invent something to appease Sherwood . Something fanciful ? . You forget my scientific devotion to the truth . But I suppose I might manage it with the play instinct  --  the simplest and most effective incitement to the imagination . Should I perhapstell him that I called on Storrs in my capacity as an alienist , to inquire into his sanity ? And as a result of my inquiry , condemned him to annihilation ? Should I describe to him how yesterday I got to that place unobserved , and fastened the wire around Storrs ' neck , and pulled on it , held him up when he jumped  --  is that what you would like ? Only I do n't know where the gloves are ; I could n't tell them that ; and I understand the law wo n't take a man 's word for it when he confesses murder , it suspects him of bragging ; he has to furnish corroboration . I 'm sorry , I must have mislaid the gloves . . . . " Dol said , " You 're as goofy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  " She stopped , and regarded him through narrowed eyes , under the brim of the floppy straw . " I 'm not apt to imagine I can guess anything from your silly camouflage , so do n't bother about it . But you deserve to hear my opinion . I do n't believe you killed Storrs and are acting for your own defense . I doubt if your talk with him yesterday had anything to do with his murder , and I doubt if you have any reason to think it had . I suspect you hit it when you said caprice . You would call it that . You are constantly digging around in other people 's brains , even common decency does n't restrainyou , and I actually believe you are mean enough to regard this as an opportunity . . . to practise . . . " " When you finish with my mote , " Zimmerman put in , " I 'll help you with your beam . It seems that you also seize opportunities for practising your profession . " He picked up another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speechless , watched him do that ; then , disdaining a reply , she turned and left him . Dismal failure indeed . Striking off across the lawn , she was hotly denying the justice of Zimmerman 's thrust . She thought of arguments : had n't she herself discovered the body ? Had n't she come here to work for the man who had been killed ? Had n't she deduced the significance of the wire spiraled around the tree ? Had n't she prevented Ranth from gettingaway with the piece of paper ? Had n't she been told by Sylvia to go ahead ? Had n't she . . . But , veering away from a perennial border where two men were scratching in the peat moss , she admitted to herself that all those arguments , if not exactly dishonest , were at best specious . She did n't need them anyway . For whose approbation were they required ? No one in the world , except possibly Sylvia . For herself . . . She stood looking down at a flaming patch of phlox and mutteredaloud , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She dismissedp145it at that , and a recurring trivial annoyance assailed her , like a persistent buzzing gnat : what the dickens was it that had happened this morning , that she wanted to rememberand could n't ? She concentrated on it futilely , then tried to dismiss that too . . . . She wanted to see Len Chisholm . After going to the house and learning that he had been dismissed from the sun room by Colonel Brissenden some time ago , and looking for him in vain on the westernand southern slopes , she finally found him in the rose garden , in the pergola with his legs stretched out on a bench , reading a Sunday newspaper . As she approachedhe greeted her and moved to make room , but she sat on another bench across the path from him . Her head felt better , but her muscles were weary . " Where did you get the Gazette ? " " One of the troopers went to Ogowoc . " " Anything in it ? " " Yeah , half the front page . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picture of the house too , I wonder where they dug that up . Want it ? " Dol shook her head . " I 'll read it later maybe . What did the uniformed colonel do to you ? Was he tough ? " Len grimaced . " Honest to God , Dol , I do n't know how it happens those babies do n't get smacked in the puss oftener . " " Good heavens , did you smack him ? " " No , I only wanted to . I reprimanded him . I let him have it straight . I even told him I was an American citizen . Do n't you worry , I acted like a gentleman . " " I 'm not worrying . " Dol frowned at him . The whites of his blue eyes looked bloodshot , he had obviously not shaved , his shirt collar was wrinkled and his tie askew , and his hair was more than ordinarily chaotic . " Yes , I am too . Of course I 'm worrying . I am taking advantage of this opportunity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Fine . " Len leaned back and clasped his hands behind his head . " You 'll do better at it than that tin soldier . That damn fool pretended he thought I did it . " " Maybe he does think so . " Len grunted . " Do n't frighten me out of my wits . " " I wo n't . I want you to use your wits . For instance , tell me what happened yesterday at Martin 's place . I understand you got there around three o'clock . Then what ? " " Aha ! " Len sat up . " So that 's it . You pretend you 're investigating a crime , and what you are really doing is prying into my conduct with other women . Thank heaven you have betrayed yourself at last ! Jealousy like yours reaches a point where it is uncontrollable , and then it explodes . I refuse to defend  --  " " Please , Len , postpone it . I want to know what hap-pened . " He spread out both hands . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three o'clock , Martin driving like a demon . We found Steve Zimmerman there on the porch , lookingas if somebody had fed him ipecac . Martin excused himself and went in with Steve , and Sylvia found shoes and things , and rackets and balls , and that what's-hisnameput up the net for us  --  " " You mean de Roode. "  | " Right . Sylvia and I volleyed a little , and then she wanted to sit and talk , she said about my job . What she really wanted was to put her sign on me . She was waving the wand when Martin came out , and kept it up on account of momentum . I was like stone , I would n't give an inch , I was thinking of you all the time . Martin got nervous and butted in , I made one or two appropriate comments , Sylvia got frustrated and bitter , and finally I saw it might end in bloodshed , so I merely bowed to them and came over here . No man was ever more faithful  --  doI go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Talk sense . Then  --  as you told Sherwood  --  you came here and looked for Storrs , and found him there on the bench asleep , and came away without waking him up , and walked around the front of the house and met Sylvia near the tennis court . Is that right ? " " You heard me say it . " Len put up his brows . " Sylviaagain , huh ? But we did n't sit and talk then . We played  --  " " Do n't do that ! Please . As you came up the slope and around the front of the house , did you see anyone ? Janet or Ranth or anybody at all ? " " Doi my love . " Len twisted his body around and put his feet on the ground . " What do you think you 're doing ? " " I told you , I 'm investigating Storrs ' murder . " " But not . . . my dear lady . . . not like this . I mean you 're not serious . Asking me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil has that got to do with it ? "  | " I do n't know . " Dol kept her eyes level at him . " I 'm asking about everything I can think of . I would especiallylike to know what Steve went to see Storrs about yesterday morning . . . yes , I still would . And I 'm still wondering why you told all of us yesterday that you looked for Storrs and could n't find him . " Len waved a hand . " You 're cuckoo . The sun 's got you . You actually sound as if you meant it . " " I do mean it . Oh , I know your explanation of that lie was perfectly simple and natural , but I wonder anyhow . I am a detective , Mr. Chisholm . And I happen to be aware that you know how to conceal your feelings quite effectively and that you are a practised and accomplishedliar . After explaining to Sherwood why you had said that you had n't found Storrs yesterday , you went ahead and told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us . " " Me ? You 're crazy . I was the soul of candor . " Dol shook her head . " You told him a lie . " " Name it . " " You said that you are in love with me and that I am the only woman you have ever cared for . " " Well by God ! " Len jumped up . " That 's gratitude for you ! Just because I do n't turn on Hearts and Flowersand whine around like a sick calf ? Do you think you can crush my passion like that ? Do you think you can blow it away with a puff ? Do you think  --  " " Cut it out . " Dol looked unimpressed . " Stop it , Len . The horse play was all right as long as it merely helped you to hide what you did n't want to show  --  I did n't mind  --  some times I really enjoyed it  --  but not now.  |p149It  may have nothing at all to do with this business , but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You are no more in love with me than you are with the Empressof China . " " There is no Empress of China . You play with my heart as a cat plays with a mouse . China became a re-public  --  " " Len , will you stop ? Do you think I 'm an imbecile ? Do you imagine I do n't know that you are completely bewitched by Sylvia ? " It hit him , quite unprepared as he was for it , and , with her eyes on his face , she saw that it did . But he made a good and almost instantaneous recovery . He stared , and got incredulity into his voice : " Say that again ? I would n't have believed it . You are jealous ! I 've got demons , you 've got demons . . . " Dol shook her head . " No good , Len . I saw it months ago . I suppose you fell for Sylvia the first time you met her , that day last spring at the Giffords ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to trip Martin up and make a play for her  --  or maybe you did and it did n't work . You have a fine equipment of words and postures to cover up with , but I 've been educated and . I 'm hard to fool . - She put her sign on you all right , so much so that you could n't resist the desire to see her , just to look at her and listen to her , but you were n't going to make an exhibitionof yourself , so you got the idea of pretending I was the attraction . I suppose you figured you could n't hurt me any , in spite of your charm , because you knew I had been inoculated and was immune . I credit you with that consideration  --  "  | " Dol , you darned fool  --  " " You 're another . If I had n't been immune I would n't have seen through you so easily . Why do you think I 've tolerated all your clowning ? Why else would I , except from compassion I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bother to , if it were anyone but Sylvia , but she is so lovely and desirable and honest and sweet , that if I were a man and as madly in love with her as you are ,  --  if I wanted her as much as you do and could n't get her ,  --  but that 's the point I 'm coming to . Why all the abnegation ? You do n't owe Martin anything . You do n't regardthe ties of betrothal as sacred , do you ? Since you 've used me for four months as a peg to hang your hat on , and I have n't kicked , I think I have a right to ask that . Why have n't you had the spunk to make a try for it ? " Len growled , " It 's not a question of spunk . " " What is it then ? " He shook his head . Abruptly he got to his feet , shoved his hands deep in his pockets , and scowled down at her . He shook his head again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rose from the vine on the trellis  --  ayellow everblooming climber  --  crushed it in his hand , and tossed it to the gravel . He came back to her : " Look here . Have you noticed that I 'm going off my nut ? What am I going to do about it ? " " Well , Len , what have you tried ? " " Nothing . I thought for a while it might go away . Along in the early stages I kidded with her  --  I thought I was kidding  --  and she beat me at it because she is full of devils . Once I asked her why she wasted herself on a guy like Foltz when material like me was available , Ip151said surely she did n't love him , and she looked at me  --  you know how she can look  --  and she said oh no , she did n't love Mr. Foltz , she was going to marry him only because her guardian wanted her to and she always obeyed her guardian , and she began making suggestions how I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said first I should learn to play the piano because Storrs was fond of music . That was how far I got kiddingwith her . " " You might have tried just telling her how you felt . That might have interested her . " " Yeah , sure . " Len sounded bitter . " I did try that once , and she was clever enough to pretend she thought I was kidding again , and began making plans how I could write to her after I got into a monastery . And anywayyou 're wrong . I 'm not in love with her , it 's only some kind of delirium . Infatuation maybe . I would n't marry her if she mounted an altar on wheels and followed me around with it for ten years . She 's worth what ? Three or four million ? What would be my title , Equerry of the Steering Wheel ? I wish to God she would go ahead and put the loop on Foltz and lead him away ; with her guardian gone she might forget why she picked him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Why did you stampede me with this now ? " " To show you that I know what an accomplished liar you are . " " Does anyone else know about it ? " " You mean about your delirium ? " " Yes . "  | " I imagine not . " " Does Sylvia ? " " I do n't think so . Sylvia 's conceit is quite superficial ; she is really very modest about herself . " " Does Foltz ? " " I doubt it . " " You have n't discussed it  --  with her ? " " Certainly not . " " You 'd better not . Forget it . Do n't bother about the compassion ; I would n't know what to do with it . You have n't time anyway ; you 're investigating a murder . " He turned and strode away , down the path ; at ten yards he wheeled to call to her : " And I wo n't annoy you with any more clowning ! " Then he went . Dol sat and watched him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He swung to the right , into a crosspath ; then , above the intervening bushes , she could see only his head and broad shoulders as he passed through the arch at the far end . She had thought for weeks that it would some day be amusing to inform Len Chisholm how transparent his antics had been  --  and now it had happened this way . Nothing very amusing about it , and nothing revelatory either , as far as she could see . Detective ? Piffle . She was nothing but a darned female quidnunc . A breeze stirred gently , and the air around her was fragrant from the roses . She looked at the Gazette with its sections scattered on the opposite bench , and was momentarilyminded to reach for it , but did n't . She looked at the ravished rose Len had plucked and crushed and tossed away ; and by some obscure communication in herP153brain it was the sight of those discarded petals , abandonedthere on the path , which brought into consciousnessthe trivial little fact which had been eluding her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Relieved but not elated , she smiled commiseratingly at herself . So that was it ! Certainly not worth all her cerebral searching . Probably worth nothing whatever ; all the same , she would go and take another look . She got up and shook down her skirt ; and discovered how jumpy her nerves were by the sudden start she gave when the loud sound of a gong came from the east terrace ; Belden announcing lunch . P154LUNCH EON , naturally , was a complete failure socially , and not a marked success biologically ; platesGwent back with rejected contents far in excess of the politeness percentage . Meals are the times above all others for household solidarity , not only as a preservativeof civilization , but also for digestion 's sake ; and they can be horrible and dismal affairs when hostility or apprehension or any acute disruptive emotion has invadedthe breasts of the partakers . They were all present , even Mrs. Storrs , and including Martin Foltz , who had apparently not taken advantage of the permission given him to go home . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declined her invitation and gone to Ogowoc , but would return shortly . They were eating in the shadow of death , but not with the reliquiae under the roof with them ; the body of P. L. Storrs had been taken to Bridgeport for an autopsy . The ordeal over , Dol got away and outdoors again , alone . Forlornly , without any expectation of the event , she intended nevertheless to satisfy herself regarding the phenomenon which she had finally dragged into memory . Once more she took the path to the kennels , turned aside at the gap in the hedge , entered the vegetablegarden and followed the central path to the other end where the compost heaps were . Glances both waysP155had assured her that for the moment no one else was exercisingany curiosity regarding this part of the grounds ; nobody was in sight . She stood and looked at the compost heap in recent use . It did not appear to have been disturbed since she had seen it three hours previously ; there were the corn husks , the spoiled tomatoes , cabbage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little pile of pink and unripe watermelon meat . . . . She did n't want to walk onto the mess , nor did she wish to disturb it . Lifting her skirt , she stepped on top of the low brick wall enclosing the heap , and edged around it , bending over , peering . She went clear around , inspecting every inch , arriving at the other side and jumping back to the ground . She stood frowning , thinking , " Of course I 'm a fool . Probably they forked this thing over before I was here this morning and covered up the rind . But the fact remains that that 's not more than a fourth of a watermelon , and it 's not ripe , and there 's not a speck of rind or the white part in sight . If somebody tried one and threw it away . . . anyhow , what the dickens , what else have I got to do ? " She returned along the central path , near its middle turned left , and stood surveying the ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foliage perhaps sixty feet square , with here and there , for a sharp eye , a glimpse of the rounded , rich green top of a melon . She saw that she could expect no hint from displacedOnes or trampled leaves or stems , because those signs of recent disturbance were all over the patch ; men that morning , she presumed , stepping , stooping , brushing the foliage aside . . . and possibly also conceiving the same idea that had occurred to her , and testing it . . . only with her it was not merely a wild conjecture , she had arrived at it logically . . . . She looked around again , in all directions , saw no one , stepped off the path into the foliage , pushed leaves aside to disclose a melon , and getting her fingers under it , turned it over to look at its bottom . She shook her head and went on to find another , and another . It became apparent that she would have to look sharp at every step , bending to thrust the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any . After ten minutesof it she began to feel silly , but she also felt stubborn , and she kept doggedly at it . She straightened up to take a kink out of her back , then muttered to herself , " Leave no melon unturned , " and squatted again as she found another one . . . . She was at the right edge of the patch , near the strawberrybed , when , rolling a large fine melon partly over and squinting at its bleached bottom , she gasped in astounded disbelief . It was as though , opening oysters with an idle pretense of looking for pearls , she had , incredibly , actually found one . She sat back flat , crushingfoliage and stems regardless , trembling all over . She saw that she was trembling , and could n't stop it ; then suddenly she was stiffened by a dreadful thought : " What if they 've been here and found it ? But no . . . surely . . . they would have taken the melon . . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be seen . She needed some kind of a tool , a nail filep157perhaps , and had left her handbag lying on the path . She reached to her hair and pulled out a bobbie pin , stepped close to the melon , squatted , carefully turned it over on its side , and looked again at the irregular rectangle , as big as the palm of her hand , which a knife had made cutting through the rind . She pushed tentatively at the rectangle of rind ; it was loose ; she stuck the bobbie pin into it diagonally and pulled , and the piece of rind plopped out . Her hand was trembling again as she inserted it into the cavity ; was it empty ? Was it just a melon plugged to see if it was ripe ? The answer was in her hand as she pulled it out : a pair of heavy tan leather gloves . She thought : " I must stop this damned trembling ; I 'm a swell detective , I am . " She replaced the rectangle of rind in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go , and rolled the melon back to its rightful position . She sat down on the foliage where she had already ruined it , extended her legs straight out , pulled up her skirt , and stuck one of the gloves under the top of her left stocking , and the other under the right . On her feet again , with her skirt smoothed down , a glance around still disclosedno eye observing her , and she made her steps unhurriedas she went to the path and got her handbag , sought the central alley , and followed it to the gap in the hedge . There she stopped , indecisive . Which way to turn ? To the house , of course , to see Sherwood , or to await him if he had not returned . But no  --  she compressed her lips  --  not of course . Those gloves were , at least for the moment , her own private loot , her privatepI58 and personal discovery , and she would at least examine them . Not outdoors ; she wanted walls , opaque to curiouseyes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the place . The stable ? That would do . She emerged from the gap in the hedge and turned right . , ; There was no one there . She stood on the concrete floor and called , and there was no answer . But one of the men might come through the door unexpectedly , so she moved to the other end , beyond the stalls , beside a dusty window , and got the gloves from their intimate concealment , damp with watermelon moisture . They were brown , looked new , heavy for driving or country , and stamped on the inside of the cuff , " Genuine Horsehide . " She did not recognize them as any she had ever seen . She looked at the palms and , if proof was needed , found it . Deep marks cut into the new leather , diagonally across from the little finger to the crotch of the thumb , on both of them . Circumstantial but conclusive evidence that P. L. Storrs had not killed himself , for she held there in her hands the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . Who ? A thought struck her . She rejected it as capricious ; it came back . She admitted it to consideration , and it possessedher . She could do it , or at least she could try , and there was no reason why she should n't . Had n't she found the gloves ? It would mean at most an hour 's delay , if it came to nothing . But where to leave the gloves meanwhile ? They were certainly too precious to take any chances with . Hidep159them . . . where ? There was no place good enough . She lifted her skirt again and carefully and thoroughly tucked the plunder back beneath her stockings , and felt no delicate discomfort at the touch of the moist leather against her skin . Then she went back past the stalls , left the stable , and headed for the house . Instead of entering , she veered to the right and approached , from the rear , the graveled space where her coupe was parked . Other cars were there too , three or four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown suit sat on a running-board talking ; and as Dol arrived another car , a large sedan , drove up and rolled to a stop , and its door opened and Sherwood and Colonel Brissenden got out . Dol was right there ; Sherwood lifted his hat ; Brissenden ostentatiously did not see her . For a split second Dol weakened ; she could feel against her legs the two objects which those men would give a night 's sleep for ; then her resolution returned and she let them briskly cross the terrace . Paying no attention to the two on the running-board , she went to the coupe and got the key from the dashboard compartment , opened the panel at the rear , took out the pigskin case , relocked the panel and returned the key . With the case in her hand , she entered the house . She knew she was taking the long way around ; she should have started at the other end , the melon , but that was not practical . She knew too that this was an undertaking for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was beside the point  --  her point . So she asked Belden where Ranth was , thinking he would be a goodp160one to begin with , and found him downstairs in the billiard room , alone , with no cue , rolling the balls around with his hands . He bowed as she approached : " Miss Bonner ! Am I to be spoken to ? " She felt pressed for time . She rested the pigskin case on the edge of the billiard table and took his eye : " Why not , Mr. Ranth ? Especially since I want to ask you a favor . No reason and no recompense ; just a plain unadulteratedfavor . I am doing an experiment and I want samples of the fingerprints of everyone here , and I 'm starting with you . Will you let me take them ? " He looked surprised . " Well ! " He rubbed his cheek . " My fingerprints ? It . . . it seems one of those requestswhere one can say , why should I ? or why should n't I ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment , then lifted his shoulders and dropped them . " Sans pear et sans reproche . So why should n't I ? You have paraphernalia there ? Go ahead . " Dol opened the case , again disclosing to a rude gaze the Holcomb pistol and box of cartridges strapped to the lid , and fished for what she wanted : the ink-pad , the tablet of paper with tissues between , the bottle of inkremover , the gold pencil with indelible leads . While not an expert , she was not utterly a greenhorn , for she had read a good treatise and had spent quite a little time practising . She uncovered the pad and said , " Right hand first , please . " She showed him how : the thumb , then the fingers consecutively ; and without comment he followed her instructions . She marked on the slip of paper , " Ranth RH . " When the left hand too was finished shep161took the stopper from the bottle of ink-remover , with its swab on a wire , and dabbed the tips of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Thank you so much . Your equipment is quite complete , really pro-fessional . " Doi , repacking the case , lifted her black lashes to permit her caramel-colored eyes a curious glance at his dark-skinned face . She protested , " I should thank you . You were very nice about it , to humor me . Gallantry does have its advantages . " She snapped the case shut . " I have told everyone else that I am investigating Storrs ' murder . They think I am fiddling at a funeral , but I 'm not . I have not told you because you could not reasonablysuppose that I was asserting a privilege of friendship , since we are not friends . " He bowed . " I was unforgivably stupid about that piece of paper . It was better for me that it should be found there . You did me no harm , and I am sure you are not trying to make opportunities . " He gestured at the case in her hand . " You are welcome to that small civility . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Upstairs , she sought Belden , and learned that Mr. Foltz was in the study with the members- of the family  --  presumably a consultation . She sent the butler off with a request to Mrs. Storrs , and shortly he returned with the response that she was to go right in . The study at Birchhaven , as is the case in so many well-to-do American homes , was the room permitted to the master of the house for such petty privacies as his repertory might afford , and was called that , by unintendedparadox , because he would never have dreamed of doing any studying in it . Dol had never been in it , but knew where it was . Entering it under the present circumstances , she had no time to inspect its treasures : the mounted rainbow trout , the hunting prints , the radio cabinet , the framed college diploma , the Rocky Mountainsheep head . . . . Mrs. Storrs was seated across by a window ; near her on a stool , erect and still frozen , was Janet . Martin and Sylvia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in the big chair at the desk , with a legallookingpaper in his hands , sat a man with a clipped gray moustache , darting gray eyes , and an air of sad but unavoidable importance . Mrs. Storrs said , " Yes , my dear ? This is Mr. Cabot . He is . . . he was my husband 's lawyer . Miss Bonner , Nicholas . You want to see me ? " Dol was gripping the handle of the pigskin case . She nodded . " All of you . I 'm sorry to interrupt , but it wo n't take long . I 'm doing an experiment . " She moved to the desk and lifted the case to it . " Please do n't ask me to explain , and do n't think I 'm a Pulcinella . " The case was open . " I 've just taken Mr. Ranth 's fingerprints , and I 'd like to take yours  --  all of yours . You first , Martin ? " There were sounds  --  a little exclamation from Sylvia . Mr. Cabot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who is this young woman ? " Dol had an exaggerated dislike of lawyers , on account of her dealings with them as an aftermath of her father 's ruin and suicide . She put out her chin at him : " I am a detective whom Mr. Storrs hired to come out here yesterday afternoon . I am attending to my busi/ness and would suggest that you stick to yours . " She turned her back on him : " I 'm not playing tricks or makingmud pies , I really do want your fingerprints . There 's no reason you should n't give them to me , is there ? " Martin stood up . " You can have mine if you want them . You say you took Ranth 's ? " He moved to the desk . " Yes , he was very obliging . Here , this way . " She showed him how , took all ten fingers , removed the ink for him . His hands were nervous but strong , longfingered , sensitive . He looked at the prints with interest . Dol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came over . The lawyer interposed , " Just a minute , Miss Raff ray . This seems to me  --  " " It 's all right . " Sylvia had done it often before and was going about it almost professionally . " This is Dol - Bonner , my partner . I do n't know what the dickens she 's up to , but I can see she means it , and that 's enough for me . . . . That all right , Dol ? You 'll explain when you get around to it . . . to me . Wo n't you ? " Dol patted her shoulder . " You 're okay . I 'll explain when the time comes . If it comes .  --  May I , please , Mrs. Storrs ? " Cabot merely sat back and frowned as his new client , the widow of his client , got up and approached . She acquiesced with her normal intensity : " I have no reason to refuse . You know , Nicholas , Peter always said I had no respect for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was wrong . He was wrong about many things .  --  Oh , I see , I pressed too hard .  --  I merely would not let them interfere with acroamata which went far below the depth ofp164facts , and soared far above their horizon . " She lifted the print of her left hand . " See that ? That poor meager fact ? Do you suppose I could admit it as a witness to contradict my soul ? " She put it down . Dol said , " Janet ? If you do n't mind ? " Janet offered no discussion of facts and souls ; she said nothing . She walked to the desk in stately indifferenceand followed instructions , and did it more neatly than any of the others , even Sylvia . When Dol cleaned her finger-tips she extended the right hand again for an infinitesimal smudge on the thumb . Dol put the things back in the case and closed it , thanked them collectively and apologized for intruding , let the lawyer have a curt nod as a minimum of courtesy , and left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted her skirt for a brief glance to make sure that the gloves were secure . She still had to get Len Chisholm and Steve Zimmerman . They proved to be equally amenable and almost equally unpleasant . She found Len in the rose garden pergola again , where he appeared to have assumed squatter'srights , and he was , in a word , grouty . She ignored his rudeness and sarcasm ; what she was after was fingerprints , and she got them . Zimmerman was finally discovered in the peach orchard back of the garage , sitting on the bottom rung of a stepladder , moodily splitting a fruit . When Dol explained what she wanted he sat and stared at her for a full half a minute without any effort to conceal his contempt ; then , without a word , he put down the peach , wiped the juice from his fingers on thep165grass , extended a hand to her and held it there . She was , in fact , surprised ; she had rather expected a refusal from him , He was last on the list @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her procedure , and decided not to complicate matters by trying to lug the melon off somewhere . If someone came up she would have to call on her wits . She went to the compost heap and put the pigskin case down there , then went to the patch and found the melon . The stem was tough and hard to break , and she had trouble lifting it , because she had to be careful to touch as little of its surface as possible . It was big and heavy , and carrying it with her hands at the ends , and held away from her dress , was not easy . At the compost heap she put it gently down on the brick wall , opened the case , and got out the white powder , the spray gun , and a magnifyingglass . She was not trembling at all now , quite cool and efficient . She tried a couple of shots with the spray on a cabbage leaf , then turned it on the melon . Delicately and evenly she spread the film ; nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side ; then she . got two good impressions . She looked at them through the magnifyingglass , and saw that they were her own ; she knew her whorls ; but later she could make sure . She became precipitate and got the film too thick and swore under her breath . Then , after turning the melon a little , she got several good prints , and then some more . She covered all the exposed surface before she took the glass again ; and , after an examination , she got from the case the envelope holding the samples she had collected , and began comparisons . Some of the prints on the melon were definitely not her own . Nor any of her samples either ? That was quite pos sible , she thought , indeed , more than possible , but she went on comparing . One paper of specimens after anothershe laid aside with a shake of her head ; then , after one look through the glass at the next one , she smothered a cry of incredulity and peered at it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She placed the paper close to the prints on , he melon and bent over , close , for a detailed comparison  --  back and forth with the glass , this one , that one , this one , that one . . . . There was no room for doubt . She stood up and mutteredin an incredulous whisper , " I will be damned . " The total surprise of it bewildered her and made her knees weak . She sat down on the edge of the brick wall . Well , she thought , there she was . The gloves that had been used to murder Storrs were there under her skirt under her stocking-tops , and that was all right , she could go to the house and turn them over to Sherwood . But the devil of it was that she knew who had hid them in that melon , and she devoutly wished she did n't . Whether she really hated men or only thought she did , assuredly she did not hate women ; and especially , under the circumstances , to know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was very bad . To turn her over to Sherwood , to the inquisition , to that military creature Brissenden . . . It was not Dol 's custom to dally long over decisions.  |p167She  knew that this was a serious one , even possibly perilous , but when she had made it she did n't hesitate . She arose energetically , her knees no longer weak , took a piece of gauze from the pigskin case , and began methodicallyto wipe the melon clean . She knew that no matterhow thoroughly she wiped , a microscopic examinationwould betray traces of the powder she had used , but she hoped it would n't come to that , and anyway she could n't help it . When she was sure that no spot of the melon 's surface had been missed , she picked it up and carried it back to the patch and replaced it in the spot which nature had selected for it , and rolled it back and forth , handling it so that it would show as many of her own prints as might reasonably be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the compost heap , collected her accessories  --  the powder gun , magnifying glass , specimenprints , gauze  --  arid packed them in the case and closed it . There was a detectable film of powder all around  --  on the bricks , the edge of the compost heap , the ground at the other side  --  but she decided that  --  nothingsatisfactory could be done about it . Gripping the handle of the case , she left the scene of her questionable triumph , passed again through the gap in the hedge of yew , and pointed her steps for the house . Trying not to look too determined , she entered by the east terrace , passed down the side corridor to the study door , and rapped sharply on the panel.  |p168SHE  opened the door and went in . The same fivewere there . Three pairs of eyes were on her inquiringly ; quiringly ; one pair , Janet 's , indifferently ; another , the lawyer 's , with irritation . He snapped , " Really , this is a private family  --  " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know I 'm a nuisance , but I must ask Janet about something important . Will you come with me , Janet ? " Janet 's mask relaxed enough to express mild surprise . " Come with you where ? Ca n't you ask me here ? " " No , I ca n't . It may take too long . And I want to show you something . I wish you would come . I think you ought  --  " " This is preposterous ! " Judging by his voice , Mr. Cabot 's irritation was preparing to blaze . " Miss Storrs is engaged with us  --  " No one paid any attention to him . Martin was frowningat Dol , and Sylvia , who knew Dol 's ways and tones , was gazing at her with eyes narrowed in puzzled solicitude . Mrs. Storrs , apparently by now resigned to any fact and unimpressed by any , told her daughter , " Go with her , child . See what she wants . " Janet , without comment , got up and crossed to the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod decliningMartin 's polite approach ; they passed through into the hall and Dol pulled the door to.  |p169'What  is it ? " Janet demanded . " What do you want to show me ? " Then she looked startled as she felt her arm being pinched , and puzzled as she heard Dol saying : " I never do have enough powder along . If you would n't mind . . . you use Valery 's Trente-trois , do n't you ? That will be close enough . . . . " The trooper , whose approach down the hall had caused this warning and camouflage , stopped near them and nodded at the study door . " Is Miss Raffray in there ? " Dol told him yes ; and as he thanked her and knocked she took Janet 's arm and started her down the hall . " We 'll go to your room and I 'll take my pick . You 're sure you do n't mind ? I hate to bother you . . . . " The reception hall was empty , and the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs together and went down the upper corridor to its end , the last door on the right . Dol , whose trips to Birch haven had been as Sylvia 's guest , formerly , when she had lived there , and latterly when she had come out from her town apartment for week-ends , had never  --  seen Janet 's room before . It was old-fashioned , feminine but not frilly , comfortable but not cluttered . Janet said , " You do n't really want powder , do you ? " Dol shook her head . " Let 's sit down . " Janet shrugged , moved , and lowered herself to the end of a blue silk chaise longue . Dol put the pigskin case on the floor and pulled a chair around . She sat and looked straight at Janet and said , " I 've found the gloves . " Janet indubitably had control , but it was not perfect.  |p170Her  jaw moved perceptibly as her teeth clamped , and her fingers tightened on the silk of the chaise longue . Her eyes betrayed nothing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She sat and met directly the gaze of the senior partner of Bonner &; Raffray . Dol repeated , in the same low imperturbable tone , " I say , I 've found the gloves . " Janet said , her soprano more musical than Dol had ever heard it , " I heard you . What gloves ? " " You do n't know what gloves ? " " I do n't know what you 're talking about . " Dol sighed , carefully , for strength . She was not liking this . " Listen , Janet . I suppose you figured that no one would think of the watermelon . Anyway , you left your fingerprints all over it . At least two dozen , and every one of them yours . There 's no use in our talking unless we take , as a basis of discussion , the fact that you took the gloves which had been used for murdering your father , and hid them in that watermelon . I 'm not going to ask you about that ; I already know it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had pressed deep into the cushion and her jaw twitched again , twice , before she spoke : " What if we do n't take that as a basis of discussion ? What you said . What happens then ? " " Then I deliver the gloves to Sherwood , with the proof that you hid them , and you can deal with him . " " And if we do take it as a basis , then what ? " " Then , first , I want to ask you some questions . " " Did you take the gloves ? Have you got them ? " " I took them . "  | " Have you got them here ? Show them to me . " Dol , without taking her eyes from Janet 's face , sat and considered warily . She saw , from the swifter rise and fall of Janet 's breast , that there had been an internal demand for more oxygen , and that looked suspicious . There was no telling what that girl could be capable of ; she might , if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually try to start a roughhouse . Dol , having seen her smash a tennis ball and vault into a saddle , knew that she was far from puny . Dol said , " Do n't get any silly ideas . If the gloves were here before you , in my hand , and you tried to grab them , one yell out of me would bring an army , and then where would you be ? I 'm even keeping my voice low , not for my sake , but yours . The gloves are in a safe place . When I get through talking with you I 'm going to turn them over to Sherwood . What I tell him , or do n't tell him , depends on what you tell me . " The heave of Janet 's breast was subsiding . She sat with no change of expression , and no movement save a slow gradual slumping of her shoulders ; then suddenly she jerked herself back to straightness , so abruptly that Dol felt her own muscles tighten involuntarily all over her body in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hid them in the watermelon . What do you want to know ? " " I want to know . . . " Dol hesitated . " Look here , Janet Storrs . I 'm not as tough as I thought I was . I know that people can do unspeakable things . I know that daughters have killed their fathers . I thought I was as hard as my knowledge should have made me , but I'm not . If what you tell me . . . if it appears from what you say . . . that this is as ugly as that , I do n't know what I 'll do . I 'll probably leave the gloves on the card tray in the reception hall and let them find them there , and keep my mouth shut . I do n't owe it to anybody , not even myself , to mix in anything as horrible as that . " Janet spoke into Dol 's eyes . " I did n't kill my father . " " I hope to God you did n't . Who did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Where did you get the gloves ? Who gave them to you to hide ? " " Nobody . " " Where did you get them ? " " I found them . " " Where ? " " In the rose garden . " " Where in the rose garden ? " " Under a bush . Under the mulch . Peat moss . I saw the mulch had been recently disturbed , and wondered if it was a mole , and poked at it to see . The gloves were under it . " " When was that ? " " Yesterday afternoon , late . I think about half-past five . I had been reading there in the pergola , and I left because a bird was singing in the filbert thicket , and I went to try to see what it was . Then I went back to the rose garden to get my book , and that was when I found the gloves . " Dol was frowning . " What time did you first go there to read ? " " About four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Could someone have gone there and hid the gloves , while you were reading in the pergola , without you seeingthem ? " " No . I 'm sure they could n't . It was only ten yards away . " " Then it was done while you were off looking for the bird . How long were you gone ? " " I suppose ten minutes . " " Did n't you see anyone ? Or hear anyone ? " " No , I was in the filbert thicket  --  you know howdense it is . " " I do n't know . I would n't know a filbert thicket from a pine tree . " Dol 's eyes were slits of concentration . " Did you bring the gloves away with you ? Did you go and hide them then ? " " No . I . . . I brought them . I had heard voices at the tennis court , and decided to go there , and I came to my room first to change my shoes . I brought my book and the gloves along and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I put the gloves in that drawer . Then I went down to the tennis court . I had been there only about ten minutes when you came . " " Was what you told me this morning the truth ? That all the time you were in the rose garden you saw no one around at all ? " Janet slowly and positively shook her head . " No one . " " When did you hide the gloves in the watermelon ? " " This morning . Early . I was up early . " " You went there alone , and cut the hole in the melon , and took out some of the insides , and stuffed the gloves in , and put the rind back . Did you ? "  | " Yes . " " Why did you carry what you took out to the compost heap ? " " Because I thought that was the natural place for it . I . . . I did n't want to leave it anywhere else . " " Where did you get the knife @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Did you take it back there ? " " Yes . " Dol removed her eyes from Janet 's face for the first time since entering the room . With her elbow on her knee and her knuckles against her lips , she let her lashes fall . There was nothing wrong with it anywhere ; there seemed not to be . She went back over the times Janet had given , the chronology of her movements ; she considered the mise en scene out there on the east slope as she knew it ; and could detect no contradiction , no improbability . . . . Finally she straightened up . " Okay . I 'll swallow all of that for the time being and digest it later . Of course the question is , why did you hide the gloves ? I 'm not going to devil you with it . If all you 've told me is the truth , there is only one conceivable reason : because you knew who they belonged to . Was that it ? " Janet 's hands were clenched tight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a barely audible murmur : " Yes . " Dol nodded . " Of course . When you found them , why did you bring them to your room and put them away in the drawer ? Why did n't you return them to the owner ? " " Well .. . it was peculiar finding them there . "  |p175Janet  cleared her throat , but it did n't seem to help her voice any . " I thought I would just keep them . . . " " As a souvenir . Then , when you learned what had happened , and later last night when they examined everybody 's hands and mentioned gloves , you came upstairs and examined the pair you had found to see if they had been used to pull a wire , and you decided that you would defend the man who owned them against the consequences of his crime , though the crime was the murder of your father . Like that ? " " No , " Janet muttered . " Not like that . It was not his crime . He did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't ? " " Because he did n't . You know he did n't . You know . . . it was Martin . . . . " " You mean you recognized them as Martin 's gloves . " " Yes . " " Obviously . I 've read your poems , and I have eyes , especially for what you have made no great effort to conceal . I know that Martin is the only man whose gloves you would want to put in a drawer in your room , and certainly the only man you would want to protect from injury  --  at any cost . Since they were his gloves , what made you so sure that Martin had n't done it ? " " Because he would n't . " Janet 's fingers twisted . " Would he ? Why would he ? You know he would n't . Someone else got his gloves . . . someone else wanted him to be accused . . . . " " That could be a theory . " Dol was frowning . " It certainlycould have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least , someone could have used them . It seems less clear that Martin was supposed to be accused , since it was quite possible that they might never have been found , under the peat moss . " Her eyes , on Janet , narrowedspeculatively . " I know you 're a strange girl . A strange woman . After you learned what the gloves had been used for , why did n't you give them to Martin and tell him where you had found them , and leave it to him ? " . " I could n't . I . . . I could n't do that . I could n't shock him like that . " " My lord . You did n't want to shock him . You have got it bad , and him pledged to another and a richer girl . So you have n't told him about it ? You just went and hid them in the watermelon ? " " Yes . " " Did n't you realize that by doing that you might be making it impossible to discover and punish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that back  --  what you realized or did n't is none of my business . You did it , and that 's that . I think you were a Grade A ninny , but I doubt if that interests you any . " Dol arose and got the pigskin case , put it on the chair , and opened it . Then she lifted her skirt , pulled out the gloves , and arranged the tops of her stockings . She stood with the gloves in her hand : " Here they are . You see how much good it did you . " She tucked the gloves in the case and shut the lid . " I 'm going down now and turn them over to Sherwood . I 'll keep you out of it . It would look nice in the papers , that story , would n't it ? And that bully Brissenden would enjoy the details ofp177your passion for another girl 's swain . Would n't he ? I say you 're a ninny . " She picked up the bag and turned to go . Janet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . you said my fingerprints . . . " " Leave that to me . I 'll keep you out if I can . If they do get onto you , you 'll just have to tighten up your belt and take it . Holy matrimony , the things a woman will do ! " She opened the door , passed through , and closed it behind her . Downstairs , in the reception hall , she was very nearly tripped up by an unlucky coincidence , but she jumped it neatly without.a stumble . The coincidence was the fact of Sergeant Quill 's presence there , talking to a colleague , at the moment that she entered ; and the additional fact that , seeing the pigskin case in her hand , he decided that he had time to spare for a little entertainment . " Oh , Miss Bonner ! " The sergeant was in her path . " I see you took my advice , only I did n't mean the whole works , I just meant the gun . I been telling Miller here about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd like to show it to him . " He extended a hand for it . " You do n't mind , do you ? " For an instant Dol 's heart stopped , as her quick imaginationshowed her the calamitous outcome if she refused , and the trooper insisted and got stubborn and took it  --  and opened it to show his brother . So she smiled at him charmingly : " Not at all , sergeant . In just a few minutes , when I come out  --  Mr. Sherwood sent for me  --  " She brushed past him briskly , crossed to the door top178the card room , opened it and entered ; as she went to close it behind her , it was obstructed by the sergeant followingher , and she abandoned it to him . Another trooper , in there , was moving to intercept her ; she circled , ignoring him , and went to the table . Brissenden , who had been standing looking out of a window , turned at the intrusion ; Sherwood and his spectacled assistant were at the table as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his shirt sleeves , was at the farther end ; in the chair at this end where Dol had sat in the morning , was Sylvia Raffray . Dol deigned no reply to Sherwood 's indignant protestat her unceremonious interruption . She lifted the case to the table , opened it , took out the gloves and tossed them down . " There they are . I found them . " " The  --  well , by God . " Brissenden nearly knocked over a chair getting there . The man in his shirt sleeves stood up and leaned to see . But their concentration on the find was arrested by Sylvia . She too , staring at the gloves , had stood up , and they all heard her involuntary gasp ; and , looking at her , saw her eyes fixed in amazement . Sherwood 's hand , reaching for the gloves , stopped in'the air . He snapped , " What is it , Miss Raffray ? You recognizethem ? " Sylvia drew back , and looked , horrified , at Dol . Dol was at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sylvia . Sylvia dear ! Everything  --  " " Step back , Miss Bonner . " Sherwood was curt . " If Miss Raffray recognizes  --  "  |p179Dol  wheeled on him . " What if she does ? You 're not afraid you 're not going to find out who they belong to , are you ? With all the help you 've got ? If she got a jolt , give her a chance . If she knows whose they are , she 'll tell you . " " Do you know ? " " No . " Dol was patting Sylvia 's shoulder , softly . " I never saw them before . You might see what you think of the marks on them . " Sherwood had the gloves in his hand , and the others were crowded around him . Sergeant Quill was peeringover the attorney 's shoulder with compressed lips , slowly nodding his head . Brissenden wore a ferocious scowl . The spectacled assistant looked interested but skeptical . The man in shirt sleeves grabbed one of the gloves and went with it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . Exactly the same as the ones we tested with , them marks . " Brissenden growled , " Where did you get them ? " " Just a minute , colonel . " Sherwood reached across to lay the glove on the table in front of Sylvia . " Please look it over , Miss Raffray ? Miss Bonner says she never saw them before . Have you ? " Sylvia did n't take it . Dol picked it up . " Here , Sylvia . Buck up . Do n't be deducing things . All this is , it 's a fact , and you do n't know what other facts it leads to and neither do I. That glove was used to murder Storrs with . " Sylvia had it in her hand looking at it , but as Dol said that she dropped it and it fell to the floor . Quill moved to get it . Sylvia looked up at Dol : " I know it 's only ai Ip18o fact . But Dol . . . that 's a pair of gloves I bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Good lord ! No wonder it was a jolt . What did you do with them ? " " I gave them to Martin . " Sylvia swallowed . " I had made a bet with him and lost . You remember I left the office yesterday with Martin and Len ? On our way to lunch we stopped in at Gordon 's and I bought them to pay the bet . " Sylvia 's chin began to tremble and her fingers clutched Dol 's skirt . " Where . . . where did you find . . . " " Sylvia ! " Dol 's low cry was a call to courage , a bugle to summon grit . Having herself once , just once , wept in the presence of a man , it was not to be borne that any woman in the world should ever do so again . Above all , not Sylvia . She turned to the beasts : " Miss Raffray bought the gloves yesterday afternoon in New York , betweentwelve and one o'clock , at Gordon 's on 48th Street , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That should do for her . Let her alone . As for me  --  " Brissenden blew : " We 'll let her alone when we 're through with her . You seem to think  --  " " Then I 'm unique around here . If I think . " Dol was withering . " I know you ca n't investigate a murder withouthurting somebody 's feelings , but there 's no sense in your tormenting this girl , and under the circumstances it would be a good idea for you to consider my feelings . I did some darned good detective work finding those gloves , and would you like to hear about it now , or would you rather read it in the paper tomorrow morn-ing ? " THE HAND IN THE GLOVE 181P181The man in shirt sleeves cackled loudly and said , " Your name 's Bonner ? Mine 's Maguire . Pleased to meetcha . I 'm Chief of Police at Bridgeport . Some of my boys have been working here , and I know damn well they did n't find the gloves . " He cackled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He turned to the sergeant : " Bring Foltz.  --  No , wait a minute . " He switched to Dol " Tell us about your detectivework . Where did you find them ? " Dol pulled a chair close to Sylvia and sat down . She picked Sherwood to look at : " There was n't much to it . I was n't really looking for the gloves , but of course they were in my mind . I happened to be out in the vegetablegarden , and looking at the compost heap I saw a little pile of the insides of a watermelon . It was n't ripe , and there was no rind . It occurred to me that someone might cut out a piece of rind , remove some of the inside , stick the gloves in , and replace the rind . Of course it was one chance in a million , but anyway I went to the watermelon patch and looked . I found . one that had been cut . I removed the piece of rind , and the gloves were inside . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Get that melon . Fingerprints.  --  You left the melon there , Miss Bonner ? " Dol shook her head . As she had been speaking she had changed her mind about this . " I thought of fingerprintstoo . I got specimens from everybody here , and then I took the melon to the compost heap and powdered it . There were none , except my own . So I wiped it off and took it back to the patch  --  "   Brissenden barked , " Destroying evidence ! " " Please , colonel . " Sherwood raised a hand at him . He looked at Dol : " You understand , Miss Bonner , we appreciate your finding the gloves . It was a remarkable piece of work , and you deserve great praise . But searchingfor fingerprints is a job for experts . It was most audacious of you to tamper with the melon . Tampering with evidence . That sometimes leads to serious trouble , if it gets before a court  --  " " I found the gloves . " " I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? That takes time . You must have found the gloves an hour ago or more . Precious time wasted  --  " " I found the gloves . " " I know . The implication does n't escape me , that we should be thankful for what we have got , since you brought it to us . Well , we are . But . . . you say you wiped the melon off ? Why ? " " Oh , it was all covered with powder . I found the gloves . " Maguire cackled . Sherwood observed drily , " So I understand . Anyway , the melon 's no good now . We can get it later .  --  Quill , bring Mr. Foltz . Tell Grimes to make sure he knows where everyone is . " The sergeant went . " You ladies will go , please ? I may need you later , Miss Raffray . I do n't want to torment you , as Miss Bonnerputs it , but I may have to ask you some more questionsabout your conversation with Mr. Storrs yesterday morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm going to stay here , if Mr. Sherwood will let me . "   " I 'll stay too . " Sylvia had her chin firm again . But Sherwood said positively , " No , Miss Raffray . I 'm sorry , I ca n't permit it . Do n't make it unpleasant , please . " Sylvia tried to insist , but had no help from Dol , and the attorney was firm . She must go . She surrendered . Dol went to the door with her , saw her out with a squeeze on her arm , and then came back to the table and looked Sherwood in the eye and told him : " I found the gloves . What more do I have to do  --  " " All right , all right . " He pushed air down with both hands . " Sit over there , please . And no interruptions , you understand that . " The chief of police cackled.  |p184IT  APPEARED to Dol Bonner 's eye , as Martin Foltz entered the room and was conducted across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a man who had recently been drinking too much , but she was sure it was only an appearance . With all the animadversionsshe might have made regarding Martin  --  the chief of which would have been that he was a male biped  --  the likelihood that he would get soused when subjected to a strain was not one of them . She thought him tender-skinned , too ostentatiously a social epicure , and intellectually and esthetically dandified , and she was convinced that he was miles short of deserving Sylvia  --  butno man alive could have passed that test . As he took the chair Sylvia had just vacated , after a glance of mild indifferent surprise at Dol Bonner , he looked as if he were controlling an inward irritation only for the sake of avoiding an unpleasant scene . He raised his brows at Sherwood . The attorney was leaning back with his arms folded ; the gloves were not in view because they were in his right hand , concealed by his left arm . He cleared his throat . " I sent for you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've found the gloves that were worn by the murderer . " Martin 's forehead wrinkled . " Then  --  " He stopped.  |p185He  went on , " Then you know who did it . " His frown deepened . " I suppose you sent for me . . . but you ought to see that I 'm in an anomalous position , and it is n't pleasant . I have no standing or responsibility in this house , I am merely the fiance of Miss Raffray . She wished me to be present at a family conference when Mr. Cabot , the lawyer , came . Now you call me in . . . " " You misunderstand . " Sherwood 's eyes were glued to him . " I did n't send for you as a representative of the family . I wanted to ask you about the gloves . " Abruptly he leaned forward and extended his arm , holding the gloves within twelve inches of the other 's face . " Did you ever see them before ? " Martin shrank back , in reflex , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is this ? " " Take them , please . Look at them . Did you ever see them before ? " He took them . Six pairs of eyes were on him . He looked at the gloves , at the leather , the fingers , the cuffs , and when he looked at Sherwood again there was perceptible apprehension in his gray eyes and pallor under his tan . Dol thought uncomfortably and scornfully , " I hope the poor lummox does n't faint . " Martin said in a strained tone , " These are my gloves . They look like mine . Where did you get them ? " " Look at the palms . No , I said the palms . See those marks running across there ? The wire made that . The wire Storrs was strangled with . Pulling on it . " Martin demanded harshly , " Where did you get them ? " " They .. . were ... found . " Sherwood leanedp186back . " You understand now , Mr. Foltz , why I sent for you . Do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know how you knew they were mine . " " Miss Raffray told us . " " Sylvia told  --  " Martin stared . " She told  --  then did she bring  --  " He sprang to his feet . " I want to see her ! I demand to see Miss Raffray ! " Quill moved a couple of paces . Dol thought , " There you are , a spoiled brat yelling for mama . Sylvia would do better to adopt an orphan . " Sherwood said , " Sit down . Miss Raffray was here and we showed her the gloves , and she said she bought them yesterday to pay a bet she owed you . They belong to you and they were used by the murderer . Did you kill Storrs ? " Martin met his eye . " No . I want to see Miss Raffray . " " You can see her when we 're through here . Sit down . Did you put that wire around Storrs ' neck and use these gloves to pull him up and strangle him ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't . Then will you please sit down ? " Sherwood waited . Martin looked at Dol , but not with appeal ; scarcely , it seemed , with recognition . She thought , " The man really is hypersensitized . And intelligenttoo , I wonder why he 's not a genius . " MeanwhileMartin was sitting down , but he sat as if he might any instant be impelled upwards again . The attorney asked conversationally , " These are your gloves , Mr. Foltz ? " " I think they are . They look like it . " " Miss Raffray gave them to you yesterday ? "  | " Yes . " " Did you have them with you when you drove out to your place from New York yesterday afternoon ? " " Yes . " " Where were they between 4:40 and 6:15 yesterday afternoon ? " " I do n't know . " " Oh . You do n't . Where were they at four o'clock ? " " I do n't know . " The attorney 's next question was forestalled by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his head , and Sherwood got up to followhim across the room . Brissenden also arose and joined them , in the far corner . Mutterings came from the consultation of the high command . Martin looked at Dol " Something like this would happen to me . Ca n't you bring Sylvia here ? " Dol could n't help feeling sorry for him . She shook her head . " Hold the fort , Martin . Mud like this splatterson everybody . " The trio came back and resumed their chairs . Sherwoodlooked among the papers on the table before him , found one , and slid it across to Brissenden and Maguire . Then he spoke to Martin : " Suppose you tell us the historyof the gloves . From the time you got home with them yesterday . " Martin said , " This is taking it for granted that it 's the same gloves . " " Of course . That can be established . " " I 've already told you what I did yesterday . . . the hours as close as I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around three o'clock I carried the gloves into the house with me . I am positive of that , because when I was in my room changing my clothes  --  " " Zimmerman was in there with you . " " Yes . I le was talking with me while I changed . I put the gloves in the pocket of my woolen jacket . I always have a jacket along when I play tennis . " " But gloves ? It was warm yesterday . " Martin frowned . " One thing should be understood . I am not justifying anything or defending myself , I am just telling you what happened . I wear that jacket riding sometimes , and I wear gloves . I do other things around the place . Anyway , I put the gloves in the jacket . " " Okay . Then ? " " As I 've told you , I talked some with Zimmerman . Then I went outdoors and joined Miss Raffray and Chisholm . I put the jacket down  --  I suppose on the back of a chair , I usually @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and shortly afterwards Miss Raffray also left . I sat there , as I 've told you , and my man de Roode came to ask me some things  --  " " Was the jacket still there ? " " Yes . It must have been , because when I finally decided to come to Birchhaven I put it over my arm and brought it along . " Sherwood nodded . " That 's the jacket you left on a chair in the reception hall . " " Yes . I 've explained about that . I entered by the sun room , but after going around by the side hall to the east terrace , I went back in that way , and in the reception hall I decided to go to the dining-room and get a drink ,  |p189and  I threw the jacket down there . I did n't see it again until late last night , when Belden got it out of the hall closet where he had put it . " " Were the gloves in the jacket pocket when you put it on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . I do n't remember . " " You do n't . Were they in it when you left your place to come over here ? " " I do n't know that either . I do n't remember noticing them . " " When were they in it ? When did you last see them ? " " In my room . When I picked them up to put them in the jacket . " " Do you mean to say that that was the last time you saw them ? That you noticed them at no time after that ? " " That 's what I say . Yes . " There was a growl from Brissenden . Maguire was softly fingering his Morgan nose . Sherwood glanced at them and then eyed Martin again , in disgusted silence . " You 've had a lot of time to think this over , Mr. Foltz . I hope you did n't take advantage of it to enlarge any holes in your memory . You are n't playing any favorites , you 're leaving them all in . Anyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left your place  --  Chisholm , Zimmerman , any of your men . Anyonehere might have taken them while it was in the reception hall  --  Mrs. Storrs , Ranth , Miss Storrs . You would n't narrow the field for us ? No ? " Martin said evenly , " I resent that . You have no right to any other supposition than that I am giving you the facts , since there is no contradiction of them  --  " Igo THE HAND IN THE GLOVE " You 're wrong there . " Sherwood put his fist on the desk . " Listen . Somebody around here is headed for trouble , and it might as well be you . I 've had my nose pulled enough . Ranth lied and slid from under , Chisholmdid the same thing , Zimmerman wo n't talk and I 'll make him sorry for that  --  and what about you ? Will you tell me that when the butler gave you the jacket late last night , you did n't notice the gloves were gone then ? Or , to give you the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you knew we were looking for gloves ? No , you wo n't tell me that . And when you noticedthey were gone , why did n't you inform me ? Have I got a right to ask you that , Mr. Foltz ? " " I suppose you have . " Martin stirred nervously ; Dol knew he had a violent dislike of raised voices . " I noticed the gloves were gone , of course . Last night . But it did n't seem that knowing that gloves had disappeared could help you any . You already knew that gloves had disappeared ; your men were looking for them high and low . And I . . . I did n't want to discuss it . I did n't want to be questioned . " He demanded sharply , " Does anyone ? " " But last night you had a suspicion that your gloves had been used for the murder . Did n't you ? " " It looked possible . I feared that they might have been . " " Did you mention it to anyone ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not even to Miss Raffray ? "  | " Of course not . She had enough on her mind . " Sherwood glanced aside at a noise ; it was Brissenden getting up and pushing his chair back . The colonel strode around back of Dol , around the end of the table , planted himself in front of Martin , and glared down at him . His voice rasped : " Look here , Foltz . I think you 're lying . I do n't know what the truth is , but you 're not telling it . " Martin blurted , " Do I have to tolerate  --  " " Shut up ! I 've been tolerating all day . I 've never heard worse poppycock than your saying you put those gloves in that jacket and then did n't notice whether they were there or not all afternoon . You 're a damn liar ! You ca n't get away with it . " Ile pivoted , in perfectmilitary form , to Sherwood . " You 're in charge here . Are we nothing but a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of here , I 'll get another tune out of him and it wo n't take me long . Or let me give him a ride down to Station H. What the hell do I care whether he pays an income tax ? " He wheeled back to Martin . " I 've put out worse fires than any you can start ! Do n't think I ca n't open you up ! " " I think . . . you could . " Martin was pale and his voice had tin in it . " If I understand you . " " I guess you understand me ! I 'll give you something you can feel ! You need your memory tickled ! " Dol muttered to herself , " The darned infantile sadist . Pd like to stick a pin clear through him . " She knew that Martin had an acute dread of physical pain ; it wasp192a major threat to offer to pinch him . But surely , even with the flatulent colonel , it was only a bluff ; they would n't dare . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I am not lying . And I 'm not a coward , but I 'm morbidly sensitive to pain . I f you presumed to . . . to touch me , I would say anything you wanted to hear . What good would that do you ? " A perceptible shiver ran over him . " I do n't imagine you 'll try it . I have told you all I know about those gloves . " The colonel was silent , gazing down at the confessed softy in manly repugnance . At length he sighed . " For the love of Mike . " He threw up his hands , shook his head , and went back to his chair . Martin spoke to Sherwood . " I would like to call your attention to something . You do n't want to believe me when I say that I do n't know when the gloves were taken from the jacket . But that is exactly the reason why I did n't tell you when I found that the gloves were gone . I did n't see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better now . " The truth is , I was tempted . I could have told you that I saw the gloves still in the pocket when I put the jacket on the chair in the reception hall , and that would have eliminated everybody but Ranth . I do n't like Ranth . It would have eliminated my friend Zimmerman and . . . and Len Chisholm . But it was too serious a matter for that sort of temptation . I preferred to tell you the truth . ' ' . " Then you might have tried it , " the attorney observed drily . " You did n't tell us anything until we found the gloves and you had to . "  | " Pm sorry if it hampered you . " Martin stirred impatiently . " I ca n't see that it did . By the way  --  if I am to know  --  where were they found ? In the house ? " " No . Miss Bonner found them . Of course it 's her story , but I would prefer that she keep it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did . " Martin raised his brows at Dol . " So that was what you wanted the fingerprints for . " Dol nodded and grunted a yes . She told the attorney , " I can keep it all right , but Miss Raffray heard it and you said nothing to her about keeping it . " " All right . It is n't important . " Sherwood leaned back with his arms folded , pursed his lips , and surveyed Martin gloomily . " You realize , Mr. Foltz , that what you tell us is completely unsatisfactory . If it 's the truth , you ca n't help it , but that does n't make us any better satisfied . The gloves that the murderer used have been found , and we know who they belong to , and we are left precisely where we were before . That does n't sound possible , does it ? It 's a fact . We have advanced one little step , it is now certain that it must have been someone who had access to those gloves in your jacket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already pretty well convinced of that on other grounds . " He pulled at the lobe of his car , which was his favoritecourtroom gesture for a pause when his tone was down . " Do you know what an investigation like this means ? When a prominent man like Storrs is murdered ? This is Sunday afternoon . A captain of detectives is in Storrs ' office in New York , with the vice-president of the firm , examining everything . We went through everything here in Storrs ' study last night . His assodatesin New York , business and social , are being questioned ; likewise here in the country . And so on . The records of all of you here are being traced as minutely as possible , particularly , of course , with regard to your relations with Storrs . That includes you . I tell you frankly , we have so far found not the slightest contradictionof what you told us last night , that you and Storrs were the best of friends , that you never had a quarrel or cause for one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your place over the hill four years ago you have been good neighbors , and that he accepted you enthusiastically as the fiance of his ward , Miss Raf-fray . " Martin murmured , " That is all true . " Sherwood nodded . " I do n't doubt it . It has been confirmed . But I want to say three things . First , we 've found the gloves that the murderer wore , and they are your gloves . I know what you say about it , but it 's a fact and there it is . Second , the attorney-general of this state will be here tomorrow morning , and he 's a much more impatient man than I am . You 'll have him to deal with . Third , it would be a good plan for you to tell me right now what the trouble was between Storrs and your friend Zimmerman . " Martin , obviously taken unaware , jerked up straight and said nothing . Sherwood snapped , " Well ? " Martin said resentfully , " Damn it , I 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I know nothing about it . " Sherwood was leaning at him . " You do n't ? Do youp195know that Zimmerman called on Storrs yesterday morn-ing ? " " Yes . " " And that when Miss Raffray met him in the hall he was very agitated and spoke to her about a mortal in-jury ? " " Yes . He gets agitated . " " And that a few minutes later Storrs told Miss Raifraythat he would like to kill somebody ? " " Not Zimmerman . " " Who else do you suppose ? You or me or the mailman ? It must have been Zimmerman , he had just that moment left . Zimmerman refuses to tell us what the talk was about . All right . Zimmerman is an old and close friend of yours , you have known him for years . Storrs was also your good friend . Is it likely that there could have been hostility between them and you would n't know about it ? Certainly you know ! Arc you going to tell me that that was something else you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Martin turned up his palms . " I simply do n't know . " " You do n't ? You stick to that ? " " I have to , or make something up . Storrs and Zimmermannever liked each other . It was too bad , but they did n't . Storrs was a puritan and thought modern psychologywas not clean , and Zimmerman was contrary and enjoyed baiting him . " " You stick to it that you do n't know why Zimmermanwent to see Storrs yesterday morning ? " " I do . I am compelled to . " " By God , " Brissenden growled , to no one but Mars.  |p196He  repeated it , " By God . I 'd like to compel him a while . " Sherwood got up . He walked to a window and glanced out as if in forlorn expectation of spying a fact perched on a branch of a horse chestnut tree . He walked back to the table and stood gazing murkily down at the top of Martin 's head , then lifted his shoulders high , held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He kicked at the leg of his chair , and sat down . " I 'd like to try something , Dan . " It was Maguire of Bridgeport , up and beside him . " Let me have the gloves . " Sherwood handed them to him , and he approached Martin . " You say these was bought yesterday , Mr. Foltz ? " " Yes . " " You ever had ' em on ? " " No . Oh . . . yes , in the shop . " " Mind putting ' em on now ? " " I . . . do n't like to . " " Just do me a favor . Help out the cause .  --  That 's right . " He winked and grimaced at Dol . " Miss Bonner and I like to use our heads . " He grasped Martin 's right wrist and held it so that the hand , with the glove on it , was before his eyes . " Bend your fingers shut . Tight . Now open ' em . Do it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obliged . " Thanks . " Maguire drew the glove off himself , carefully , took it to the window , and peered at it in the strong light . After a couple of minutes of that , he shook his head in defeat , returned to the table , tossed thep197glove over to Sherwood , and sat down . He explained , " Thought I might compare the creases with the ones our friend made yesterday gripping that wire , since the gloves are new . None of these new-fangled ideas is worth a damn . " Brissenden said grimly , " It depends on who has them . " Sherwood was sitting with bent head and closed eyes , rubbing his brow , back and forth . At length he sighed , deeply , and looked up . " All right , Foltz . That 's all for the present . You 're on thin ice , I can tell you that . Please do n't leave these grounds  --  that 's not a request , it 's an order .  --  Weil , get Governor Chandler on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quill , tell Hurley to pass the word that everybodyon any other line than this Birch haven bunch is to call it off and report to Station I I and wait for orders . Then go with Miss Bonner and have her show you that watermelon and bring it in here . You might see if there 's any chance of footprints . On your way , send that butler in . And send someone to Foltz 's place to bring that fellow de Roode over ; I 'll see him when I 'm through with the butler . . . . " Doi , some minutes later , walking up the path toward the vegetable garden with Sergeant Quill , was not very good company . Nor was it concern or conjecture which chiefly possessed her ; it was angry dissatisfaction with herself , and wrath at another woman . She was thinking , " So Janet lied . She lied and I swallowed it ! Darn her ornery hide , she looked me in the eye and lied to me , and it looks very much as if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | SYLVIA RAFFRAY sat on a large gray stone at the edge of the rock garden , frowning at a brown caterpillar , born belated , which was mounting a twig of sea lavender in decrepit desperation . She herself , not quite desperate and certainly not decrepit , was nevertheless in an unprecedented state of mind , requiring  --  toprevent collapse into mournful inertia or tearfulhysterics , which her healthy youth despised as the easiest and weakest of feminine retorts to catastrophe  --  an amount of discipline and control which she had never before been called upon to furnish . Grief gnawed at her and could not be cast out ; she had had deep and genuine affection for P.L. ; she understood why , in a less restrained civilization , women had torn their hair and beat their breasts when their dear ones had died . And as if grief were not enough . . . Now Martin was in it . He was in there now with those men , shrinking from their noise and their questions  --  she could see him  --  explaining about his gloves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with repugnance , and with terror at the ugliness of it . No faint doubt of Martin 's blamelessness was in her unsuspiciousmind ; but characteristically  --  for she was indubitablyfortune 's spoiled darling  --  she was irritated with him because of those gloves . The gloves she had bought herself . .. and those horrible marks across thep199palms . . . what were they saying to him now .. and what was he saying . . . . " Sylvia . Er  --  Miss Raffray . " She looked up . She had not heard him approach ; apparently he had walked on the grass . She said listlessly , " Make it Sylvia . " She made an effort to flop her mind over to this intruding object ; it might help . She observed , " You certainly look sick . " Steve Zimmerman nodded . " That 's nothing to worry about . " He looked down at her , his pale eyes intent and his nostrils twitching , then sat cross-legged on the grass , facing her , six feet away . " I mean for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very far on my looks . It is popularly supposed that a man devoid of physical grace and attractiveness feels inferior about it . I never have . Of course , I 'm not normal . " " Oh , " Sylvia said . " You 're not ? " " Certainly not . Normal ? My God . I am hypercere-bral . " " I see . Hyper ' means too much , does n't it ? " " No . It means above measure . It can mean excessive . " His nostril twitched , and he rubbed it with the back of his finger . " Ever since lunch I have been deciding to have a talk with you . I saw you come out here a little while ago . " " Well ? " Her face was a foot higher than his ; he looked up at her . " It 's easy enough for you to say Well . ' Your brain is accustomed to react almost exclusively to the simpler sensory impulses . That 's a loose way of putting it , but you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to this decision by the most tortuous and difficult path I have ever followed . I have a proposalto make to you . To clear the way , and anticipate a question you will want to ask , I should tell you that I wanted first to inform Martin about it , but I have had no opportunity since I decided . He was in the study with the rest of you , and from there he was taken to the card room . So I 've had no chance  --  " Sylvia put in , " You do n't know what they sent for him for . Do you ? " " I suppose some more of the same questions that they 've asked a dozen times  --  " " No . " Sylvia shifted on the stone . " They 've found the gloves they were looking for . Dol found them . They are marked the way they said they would be . It 's a pair I bought yesterday and gave to Martin , to pay a bet . They belong to him . That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his pale eyes fastened on her , said nothing . All at once , apparently , he was not even breathing ; he might have been offering a display of suspended animation . Sylvia demanded sharply , " Well ? Why are you staring at me ? " ' " I beg your pardon . " But his eyes did n't move . " You say Dol found the gloves ? Where ? " " In the garden . Hid in a watermelon . " " You mean the vegetable garden ? " " Yes . " " But  --  " Zimmerman stopped . At length he sighed , as if he had been needing air for minutes . " Then theytip201found them . And they belong to Martin . What good does that do them ? " " I do n't know . It certainly does n't do Martin any good , or me , or anyone else . " " What does Martin say ? " " I do n't know . What can he say ? That he does n't know how they got there . What else could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded his head . " I see . That was the bomb they had to explode for him  --  a watermelon with his gloves in it . He should not have had gloves . But he had . " I le frowned and shut his eyes as if the light hurt them , then after a moment opened them again to look at her . I le said abruptly , " Anyway , that has no bearing on the proposal I want to make . Certainly I am not making it in the orthodox manner , and I suppose I strike you as pretty clumsy , but you must consider the circumstances . I want to ask you to marry me . " He sat with his pale eyes on her . Sylvia was simultaneouslyconvinced of three things : that her ears had gone back on her , that the man 's brain had cracked clear through at last , and that everything stored up for her , tragic and grotesque and merely comical , had decided to happen all at once . All she did was to ask weakly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " you 're astonished . I do n't flatter myself that the idea has ever occurred to you . Why should it ? But I have some considerations to advance that probably have n't occurred to you either . I know that young as you are , your mind is not entirely frivolous . Our marriage would promise advantages , not only to us but also to society , which could not be expected from any other probable choice you would make . I want to tell you about them , but before I do that I must clear your mind to make room for them . Otherwiseyou wo n't even hear them . The obstacles must be removed first . " He sounded , incredibly , completely serious , earnest , and sane . Sylvia , stupefied , could only gape . He went on : " The most obvious obstacle is your engagement with Martin . I can not remove that ; I can only tell you that I disregard it and I think you should . He is my closest friend , but there are three considerations which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I ' 11 explain that later . Second , the egoistic satisfaction I get from my work . Third , the object of my work , to lift our race from the animal mire it is sunk in . So I ask you to disregardMartin . I offer a comment to help you : the phenomenoncalled , much too vaguely , love , has many different factors and manifestations . The sexual factor is easily transferable , as has been proven millions of times , unless it has become romantically or neurotically fixed . With you it has not . Aside from that , your attachmentto Martin is predominantly the functioning of your maternal instinct  --  I dislike these silly romantic terms , but I do n't want to be technical  --  and that can be just as well satisfied with a lapdog , and much better satisfied with a child of your own , or even an adopted one . It is bad for Martin too ; a grown man should n't be mothered , it keeps him flabby . Your maternal instinct is obviously strong ; that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it with his faulty adjustment to an adult world , which you intuitively and unconsciouslyfelt . " Sylvia was enough recovered from her stupefaction to have found words , but she did not interrupt . She stirred on the rock , and listened ; surely not because there was a drop of sense in what she heard . . . . " So we 'll disregard Martin . There are many minor obstacles , as of course there are to any human proposal , but I think only one other major one , namely , that I am utterly unqualified as an object of romantic devotion . Look at me . My nostrils are equine , my physique is totallyundistinguished , my eyes were faded at birth . I do n't know what the devil is wrong with my hair ; possiblysomething could be done with it ; I 've never had time to try . But I am not asking for romantic devotion . If you decide to accept my proposal , and it develops later that you have a capacity for romantic devotion which requiresexercise , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out when the time comes . It is just possible that by that time I can fill the bill . Of course , looking at me now , that strikes you as preposterous , but the chronicle of romantic attachments through the centuries , judging from portraits and photographs and other evidence , is an almost continuous series of miracles . " For the advantages , take the personal ones first , and we can confine ourselves to yours , because mine are obviousand you 're not interested in them anyway . You would acquire all of the social conveniences of marriage and would assume an irreducible minimum of obligation , except financially , and you can well afford that.  | You would be free to give or to withhold . You could satisfy your maternal instinct under your own roof , with objects as temporary or as permanent as you cared to make them . You would have my intellect at your service when you wanted it , with the assurance that it would not be thrust upon you when you did n't . You would have constantly within reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time with more true pride and intelligence , than any other man you have known or are likely to know . I met you only a year ago , when I left my job in a western college to accept the offer from Columbia . I adored you , utterly and passionately , the first day I saw you . I worship you as I worship my work  --  as the justification of life and the only acceptable evidence of pure truth and beauty in the human world . And you have enriched me ; esthetically , I was born the day I saw you . . . . " Sylvia could not remove her gaze from his pale intent eyes ; the rest of his face she did not see . She made herselfspeak : " Do n't go on . . . please . Please do n't . " Zimmerman 's hand fluttered and dropped to the grass again . " All right . I do n't want to make you uncomfortable . I mention my personal feeling for you only that you may know , first , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be articulate if ever it should have the good fortune to be welcome . Otherwise I promise positively that you shall never be annoyed with it  --  as you have not during the past year . Only , as I said , it may amuse you  --  it might even some day be of service to you  --  to know that it is constantly within reach .  --  Another personal advantageto you  --  I hope you would consider it so  --  wouldp205be your assurance that some day your husband will be a famous and respected man . I am destined to dominance in my field . I am sorry I ca n't prove that ; I can only assert it . I have precisely those qualities  --  temperamental , intuitive , and analytical  --  which are needed to grasp the probe that psychology is sinking , like a dagger of knowledge , into the human brain , and to sink it to new depths . I also have a rigorous and passionate determination to perform that job . I t was my only passion , before I saw you . But do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be controlled . I can control anything that is sensible to the operations of my brain . " He disregarded a bee which lit momentarily on a strand of his stringy hair limp on his forehead . " So much for the main obstacles and the personal advantages . I want you to consider now the biggest advantage of all , to society , to science , to all men and women alive and yet to be born . Martin professes not to know the amount of your fortune , but I understand it is between three and five million dollars . You could keep a third of it for your personal needs  --  mine are negligible  --  and with the remainder we can establish a psychological research laboratory with me in charge . On account of your total ignorance of the matter , it is difficult for me to give you an idea of what that would mean . Locating it here in New York , in roomy but inexpensive quarters , we would have an inexhaustible supply of material for experiment  --  men and women , children , babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We would not need to spend more than 5% of our capital for original equipment , which would leave us an ample income for developmentp206and current expenses . I have already prepared in detaila proposed program for three years ' independent researchand experiment , with an estimate of the cost , and the probable results , under my direction , are absolutely staggering . Within ten years , at the most , our laboratory would be recognized as the center of authority , and of hope , by psychologists throughout the world . The ultimateeffect on human society , on the daily lives of men and women , would be incalculable . It would increase their knowledge , their happiness , and their effective functioning as the most highly developed of organisms . And you would have made it possible . You would have furnished the fuel that kept the fire going . Not only that , you may , if you want , take part in it . I have completedan outline for a series of experiments with babies  --  based on an entirely new concept of the relation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ general supervision . I would like to go over it with you , it is fascinating . You could handle the babies perfectly , after you had acquired a sense of the strictness of scientific discipline . That one outline would take you about two years , at ten hours a day . You would have not only constant association with twenty or thirty babies  --  I believe I settled on twenty-five  --  but also the deeply satisfying knowledge of the importance , the vital significance to all mankind , of your work . " Sylvia had been , for minutes , weakly shaking her head . She had , in spite of everything , a point of convictionwithin her , well buried , that some day she would laugh at this scene  --  but that would be after she hadp207pretty well forgotten the piercing intentness of those water-pale eyes . She stammered at them , " But I .. . I must n't let you go on this way . Really . I 'm not at all that kind of girl  --  the serious worth-while kind . I 'm as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you some money to start a laboratory . . . six months from now , when I get it . . . . " Zimmerman shook his head . " That would n't do . You would give only a comparatively small amount ; you would n't turn loose anything like two-thirds of your fortune when it came down to it ; and I would have no assurance that future needs would be taken care of . But the main objection . . . apparently I have n't made myselfclear . The laboratory would be merely one of the advantages of our marriage . I am young , and in any event I shall have a career . But it will be only half a career unless you share it . It will be a monster with brains and nerves and bones , but no hert . That is poetry . A year ago I could n't have said anything as unscientific as that , but when I met you I learned that there is not one truth , but two : a truth that lights the way , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need for warmth before , just as a man born deaf does n't feel the need for music . I mean now , specifically , merely the warmth of your presence near me . I can be frugal  --  though God knows your presence would not be frugality . " He paused . He sighed , and muttered at her , " That'smy proposal . I want to talk you into it , not out of it . " Sylvia thought , the poor guy . The poor , poor guy . He said , " I did poor work last spring . All summer I have been no good . " He sounded all at once , startlingly , ferocious . A ferocity pale like his eyes . " I must clear my mind at any cost . I have work to do . " Sylvia looked at him , and her eyes widened , because she had never had to bother about concealing her feelingsin obedience to any necessity other than that imposedby good manners . So , when the thought came to her and she accepted its plausibility @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Is this what you went to see 1 ' . L. about yesterday morning ? Is this what you talked to him about ? " He looked at her in surprise , but after only an instant'shesitation he shook his head . " No . I did n't mention it . I was n't fool enough to mention it to him . " " Then what did you go there for ? You wo n't tell those men . You wo n't talk about it . What did you men-tion ? " Zimmerman shook his head again . " I ca n't tell you . " He frowned . " You 're changing the subject . I know I 'm making my proposal to you when you 're under the first real stress you 've ever had to bear . I ca n't help it ; it 's my opportunity , and I must seize it . " " But I want to know . Wo n't you tell me ? " " No . " He was emphatic . " Some day , perhaps , if you still want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sylvia shivered involuntarily . Not at , directly and specifically , the idea of Steve Zimmerman for a husband ; it was merely the state of her nerves . She said , " I could n't ever marry you . I told you , I 'm selfish . " " That 's all right . So am I. Even from the selfish standpoint , I 've shown you the advantages  --  "  | " No . Please . " Sylvia got up from the stone . " I do n't like  --  there 's no use . " She moved a step . " Wait a minute . " Zimmerman , still cross-legged on the grass , did not tilt his head to look up as she stood . " I have put all this . . . with restraint . But I can plead with you  --  I can display the most acute suffering for your compassion  --  I can show you the most vital neces-sity  --  " " Do n't ! Please do n't . " She moved again . " Wait , " Zimmerman demanded . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I am engaged to Martin . " " But is it on account of him  --  " The sentence hung in the air , unfinished . Sylvia was gone . ' With no concession at all to good manners , and no compassion for the torment of unrequited love , she simply went . Zimmerman 's back was toward the direction she took , and he did n't turn to watch her go . I ! is head bent forward , his chin on his chest , his lids dropped to give the pale eyes a rest , and the only visible movement was his right index finger slowly poking in and out of a beetle hole as his hand , propping him , nestled in the grass . Sylvia , reaching'the top end of the flagstone steps  --  for the rock garden was at the foot of a declivity  --  looked from right to left indecisively . Would Martin be out of the card room ? Would he be out of the house ? She must know what had happened . Would she tell him of Steve 's incredible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exasperate him . . . but she knew she would tell him . Anyway , for months now she had thought that it did n't do Martin any good , his close association with that mental morbid freak , just because they had been friends before Steve had gone out to his job in the westerncollege . . . . She went past the filbert thicket , around by the rose garden , but it was empty . On all the spreading slope there was no one in sight except a trooper in uniform on the east terrace . To avoid the necessity of ignoring him in passing , she struck off to the right , and at the top of the slope circled the rear of the house . The kitchen girl Ellen , the cook 's helper , was there struggling with a bag of something , and Sylvia saw that her eyes were red from weeping and thought , " She can cry and work at the same time and I ca n't do either one . " Then , crossing the drive to the garage , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tennis court were occupied , and headed for them . It was not Martin ; it was Dol Bonner and Len Chisholm . Sylvia hesitated , then went on to them . Len , who had a drink in his hand and provisions for more in a bottle and pitcher on the table , got up and pulled a chair around . Sylvia shook her head and demanded : " Where 's Martin ? " Dol told her , " I guess in the house . I did n't see him come out after we left the card room . " " What happened ? " " Nothing . They showed him the gloves and Martin said they were his . He put them in the pocket of his jacket when he changed yesterday , and took the jacket to the tennis court , and later brought it over here . The last he remembers seeing the gloves was in his roomzit THE HAND IN THE GLOVE " Steve Zimmerman . " Len spilled some of his drink . Dol gasped . " What ! Ile . . . seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him and me to get marriedand take a couple of million dollars and start a psychological laboratory . He says he is passionate about his work and his career , and I . . . I am esthetically all right . I am to help out by experimenting with babies . You ca n't laugh at it either . Even  --  even if we felt like laughing . " Dol 's eyes were narrowed . She muttered , " Pathological . He 's unbalanced . " Sylvia shook her head . " You would n't think so if you heard him . He covered everything : his friendship with Martin  --  he disposed of that  --  his physical shortcomings , the certainty that he will be a famous man , my maternal instinct  --  the devil . Here comes one of those confounded cops . Now what do they want ? My God , Dol , wo n't this ever end ? " " It will , Sylvia dear . What you ca n't jump you have to straddle . Quit biting your lip in two . " The trooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . " " Me ? " " Yes , sir . " " Tell ' em to write me a letter . " Len reached for the bottle , poured another inch in his glass , and added a dash of water from the pitcher . " Tell ' em returned undelivered , party has moved . " He arose with the glass in his hand and backed off . " Excuse me , ladies , I do n't wantp213to miss the next act , they say it 's the best . " He followed the trooper , in long strides . Dol looked after him , and shrugged . She turned and demanded , not at all as a young lady ready for gossip , " Tell me about it , Sylvia . What did he say ? "  | AT TEN o'clock that Sunday night the small room which served as an inside office at the Station H barracks of the state police , three miles from Birchhaven on Route 19 , was filled with tobacco smoke , tension , conflicting theories , and half a dozen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a cigar in the side of his mouth , was Inspector Cramer of the New York Homicide Bureau ; beside him was Maguire of Bridgeport , looking sleepy but indomitable . A nondescripttrooper leaned against the door jamb . Colonel Brissenden , still miraculously elegant as to uniform and intransigent as to demeanor , sat erect at one side of a small table , and across from him was Sherwood , looking harried and weary but obstinate . The middle-aged man threatening to go bald , slim and saturnine with slanting eyes , was the attorney-general of the state , E. B. Linnekin , who had just driven from a Vermont week-end at sixty miles an hour to fend disaster , share kudos , and retrieve justice . Sherwood was saying , " That 's the picture the way it stands now . The only two for whom we can demonstrate any motive at all are Chisholm and Ranth . Chisholm certainly had opportunity , by his own admission  --  he went there and saw Storrs asleep on the bench , and he could have got the gloves before he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even for a coroner 's charge , letp215alone a jury . And his motive  --  just because he got kicked out of a job ? And he was sore ? Whoever went to the garden house and got that wire and went there and rigged it up and poked it under Storrs ' neck was as cool as a cucumber and as malignant as a snake . And he had an awful good reason for it , of some kind or other . " Linnekin declared , " I say there 's a woman in it . " " Hell , there 's four women in it . One of them is batty , one thinks she 's too hot to handle , one 's rich and sweet and innocent , and one pretends she 's floating around somewhere over your head when you ask her anything . I 've told you . You try it in the morning . " " I shall . " " That suits me , with no reservations . As to motive , the only thing we 've got that 's satisfactory is Ranth . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we are all convinced he did it , we 're in a hole . With the evidence that we have from three people , Mrs. Storrs and the daughter and the butler , that after seeing Storrs Ranth returned to the house before 4:30 , and Chisholm 's testimony that Storrs was alive at 4:40 , we 've got to show that Ranth went there again after 4:40 , or at least make it extremely plausible . In fact , we have to show that he went there after 5:20 or 5:25 , because that was when Foltz put his jacket on the chair in the reception hall , and Ranth could n't have got hold of the gloves before that . The butler says that at five o'clock Ranth was in the card room writing letters . He could have left the house by the sun room , after getting the gloves from the hall , and returned the same way , but no one saw him go or come . Another difficulty is that note on the grass . Isi it likely he would have left it there after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put him in a panic , but he does n't look addicted to panics . Understand , I 'm not trying to read Ranth out of it , I 'm just showing what we 're up against . It looks to me very probable that Ranth did it . What does it look like to you , In-spector ? " Cramer grunted , without removing his cigar . " Nothinglooks like anything . Whoever did it certainly got all the breaks . It 's a bad one . You 've either got to put it on Ranth or uncover some motives somewhere . If it was him , and you try it on a jury with no more than you 've got now , they wo n't bother to leave the courtroom . Did I tell you ? One of my men found Storrs ' secretary down at Long Beach , and she says she did n't hear any of the talk with Zimmerman yesterday morning , and no one else could have . " Sherwood nodded . " I got it on the phone from your office . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brought Zimmerman to the barracks late this afternoon and tried to pry him open . Nothing rough , just tactics . It only closed him up tighter . He 's an educatedmule , the worst kind . " Brissenden growled , " We should have locked him up , the damn insolent little squirt . " " I disagree . Tomorrow will do for that . If he won'ttalk at the inquest , we 'll throw him in . That right , Ed ? " " Certainly , we 'll have to . " The attorney-generallooked somberly judicious . " I think you 've acted withproper discretion , Dan . These people , except possiblyp217Ranth , are n't the kind you can put the screws on . But it 's murder , and they 'll have to talk . I say there 's a woman in it . " He licked his lips . Cramer nodded at the table . " Those gloves . " They were lying there . " You say you tried them on every-body ? " " Yes . They were loose on Zimmerman , and pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Sherwoodsighed . " I tell you , Inspector , as you say , it 's a bad one . I would appreciate it if you would go over the ground thoroughly in the morning . Now here , once more , look at this diagram . . . . " Maguire of Bridgeport closed his eyes . On the grounds of Birchhaven were the peace and stillness of night , but it was a peace under surveillance . At the entrance to the estate a motor cycle leaned against one of the enormous granite pillars , and a trooper stood at the edge of the driveway , moving now and then to keep himself awake . Down by the fish pool , thirty paces from the entrance to the nook under the dogwoods , stood another trooper . He was not stationed there ; he , and a colleague who was at that moment seated on a chair by the tennis court , removing a piece of gravel from his shoe , were on patrol . At the house , Belden had locked the outside doors at ten o'clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main terrace on the latch because there was a trooper there also , now tusslingwith boredom on a straight-backed chair in the reception hall , then going to the terrace for a cigarette ,  | an easement of his muscles , and a look at the night . When in the reception hall he could hear , very faintly if he strained his ear , a murmur of voices from the study . Or more properly , a voice , for chiefly it was George Leo Ranth speaking . After dinner , which had been sociallya replica of lunch , he had , with most admirable and exquisite finesse , maneuvered Mrs. Storrs from the room , around to the side hall where she had had no intention of going , and into the study . It was a stroke both bold and adroit for him to pick the study as the field of the skirmish ; it was the room most privately and exclusively her husband 's of all in the house , where his spirit might be expected to linger if it tarried there at all ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where your husband can challenge me ; I surmounted him in life ; I shall not evade him in death . " Now , at ten o'clock , he had won the first trench ; she was listening to him without either acquiescence or response , but without protest . The light was dim , from the reading lamp in the corner . Mrs. Storrs was seated on the divan by the radio , her hands clasped in her lap , her shoulders sagging , her eyes veiled by drooping lids . Ranth was ten feet away , easily and gracefully erect on a Turidan rug which P. L. Storrs had once brought back from Persia with his personal luggage ; he talked better standing. " . . . but that is beyond the interest of all who fail in comprehension , and to fail in comprehension is the most trivial failure of all . There is no demand from Siva that he be understood ; no rite in ancient or mod/ern Sakti that can be explained grossly to intelligence alone . Three steps : contemplation , acceptance , introgression . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : dispersion , infiltration , homoousia . The second can be reached only through the first ; the third is inaccessible until the first and second have been perfected . Three sacrifices : I , self , I myself . Shreds of identity are the tatters of incompletion . To be whole presupposes and requires infinity . There is no other way to glory . There is no method by which the eternal cycle may be entered save by disscminatibn of the personality into an infinitude of disjecta membra , to follow the unnumbered radii from the quivering center of all flesh . . . " The apostate stirred on the divan , unclasped her hands and clasped them again , and became again immobile. " . . . into the movement that can never cease . The rites of Occidental Sakti command spiritual destruction only as the prelude to humility and the sublime restoration ; they are superior to the grossness of physical destructionand no longer demand the sacrifices of the ancient temples . I , George Leo Ranth , am the priest , the hierophant , and the talapoin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cycle which I have entered . . . . " The trooper in the reception hall could hear the murmuronly if he stood perfectly still and held his breath . Upstairs , in her room at the end of the hall , Janet Storrs sat at her flat-topped desk of Brazilian cedar , with a pad of paper before her and a fountain pen in her hand.  |p220She  had formerly used a lead pencil when composing , on account of the convenience of erasing , but two years ago had changed to a pen , because in the event that the manuscripts ever became valuable , it would be much better to have them in ink . She had not yet dressed for bed , but had kicked off her shoes and got into mules . She sat with her eyes focused on the swaying window curtain , but seeing nothing ; her vision was inward . At length she sighed deeply and looked at the pad of paper : If I should say to you , " My heart is dead , My blood is still , and even pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and dawnWill find me here ; and day will come ; and red Will set the sun again ; A shiver of despair ran over her . She thought , " It 's no use ; I ca n't finish it . It was said that poetry is an emotion remembered in tranquillity .. . but God help me , I am not tranquil . . . no . . . no , I am not tranquil . . . . " She buried her head on her arms , on the desk , and her shoulders shook violently , though there was no sound . Three doors down the hall from Janet 's apartment , on the opposite side , was the room assigned to Steve Zimmerman . It was not the finest that Birchhaven had to offer guests ; it had only a lavatory in a niche instead of a bathroom ; still , it was far more luxurious than the accommodations Steve permitted himself to pay forTHE HAND IN THE GLOVE 22Ip221on 122nd Street in New York . Belden , or the maid , or both , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , since there were no towels on the rack , the ashtray on the bedstand still held cigarette butts and match ends from the night before , and when Steve went to the closet for a coat hanger he found that the door would not open and had to drape his coat on a chair . These annoyances manifestly glanced off of the shell of Zimmerman 's consciousness ; he was obviously preoccupied . Having found the closet door locked or stuck , and hung his coat on the back of a chair , he crossed to a window and opened it wider and poked his head out into the night ; from below and to the left he heard the scrape of a footstep and saw that it was a trooper on the terrace . He pulled himself in , went and sat on the edge of the bed and scratched his elbow , and stared at a row of books , between bookends , back of the light on the bed table . Ten minutes later , still sitting there , the edge of his consciousness noted the sound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the terrace ; he distinguishedno words . Finally he muttered half aloud , " I 'll go on with it . I have to . I 've started it and I 'll see it through . It is not credible that I can be shattered by events . Irony does not go that far . It would be like Einstein getting run over by a truck . " Arising to go on with his undressing , he heard footstepsmuffled on the carpet of the hall passing his door . He got stripped , put on the pajamas which had been brought over from his bag at Foltz 's the evening before ,  | sat on the edge of the bed and scratched his elbow again , and finally twisted around and stuck his legs between the sheets  --  at least the maid had not neglected to turn the bed down . There was one blessing he could count on , no matter how events exploded around him : he could sleep . He always did . He had , even that night in June when he had first admitted romantic terms into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia Raffray . But first , before he put out the light , he would lie there and tidy up a little more in his mind . He lay on his back , his eyes closed , his lips compressed , his wide nostrils expanded . . . . There was a knock at the door , a low discreet trio of taps . Steve opened his eyes , twisted and raised on his elbow , and muttered to himself , " Damn it , not tonight . It must be him . " The taps sounded again , and Steve sat up and said , " Come in . " The knob turned , the door silently swung open and , after the intruder was in , as silently closed again . Steve 's pale eyes betrayed surprise and his voice irritation . " What the devil do you want ? " The impression Wolfram de Roode produced , more by structure than by size , of brute physical power , was even more striking in this bedroom than it was out of doors . And his intelligent face , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , showed the strain of some emotion which he was obviously controlling with difficulty . He spoke low , in a tone of husky menace : " Where is he ? What have you done with him ? " Steve was sitting , his knees drawn up , looking up atp223the face above him . " What do you mean , done with him ? I suppose he 's in bed . " " He is not . I 've looked in his room . Where is he ? " " I do n't know . Maybe downstairs . How do I know ? " " He is not . " De Roode 's hands , at his sides , clenched into fists . " Damn you . You murderer ! Where is he ? " Steve said , with a good imitation of composure , " You 're a fool , de Roode . Say it louder , why do n't you ? Someone else might like to hear it . You call me a murderer ? I tell you , I do n't know where he is . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of you ? We 're not in a jungle .  --  Well , maybe we are . Anyway , he 's around somewhere . Possibly under his bed . I have n't seen him since dinner . Do n't stand there looking as if you ought to have snakes in your hair . . . you look silly . . . . " He would have to talk this neurotic ape out of the room . . . . He went on talking to that end . . . . Thirty yards away , in a room in the other wing , Len Chisholm sat in a chintz-covered chair in the cushion of which a cinder from one of his cigarettes had burned a hole as big as a dime without his taking any interest in the phenomenon . He had not undressed for bed , and betrayed no inclination for that enterprise . Sections of the Sunday Gazette were scattered around the floor ; also on the floor was a tray with a bottle , pitcher and glass . It had originally been deposited on the bureau by Belden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save mileage.  | He kicked feebly at a newspaper section which appeared to be in the way , though he had no present intention of moving , picked up the glass and swallowed a couple of gulps , grimaced indignantly at the tastelessnessof it , and muttered hoarsely because his windpipe was constricted by his posture : " I 'm nuts . Nuts very nuts . That sounds like Gertrude Stein . You ca n't fight it , you ca n't give in to it , you ca n't strangle it , you ca n't even get drunk . I 'm only a pathetic imitation of a drunk . I 'm no more drunk than you are . Drown it in liquor . You ca n't drown anything that wo n't sink . I do n't mean that . I mean I 'm already sunk . I 'm already drowned . So any liquor I swallow is merely tautology . . . . " It was midnight when the trooper went upstairs to knock at the door of Martin Foltz 's room to see if he was there . It might have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wolfram de Roode ; if he had , for instance , on leaving the Birchhaven house at 10:4o , seen fit to communicate his anxiety to the trooper . But it appeared from his actions that he was already convinced that the trooper was not in a position to be of any help to him ; at any rate , he said nothing whatever when he came downstairs , made a detour to the study to speak to Mrs. Storrs , passed through the reception hall , and went out by the main door . The trooper was momentarily minded to halt him , but , knowing the circumstances , saw no point in it , and let him go . The time consumed by de Roode in trotting back to Foltz 's place by the path through the woods was of course a necessary delay , since he had to get his car.  |p225The  first that the men at Station H heard of him was at 11:20 , when there was a call for Maguire , of Bridgeporton the telephone . The conference was still in progress , and Maguire went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the deputy warden on the night shift at the county jail . " Chief ? This is Cummings . There 's a gorilla turned up here that wants to see a guy named Martin Foltz , and by God I 'll say he wants to see him . He says Foltz is here in my hotel , and I say he ai n't . I was getting ready to throw him out on his ear , when it occurred to me that that 's one of the names I saw in the paper about that Birchhaven murder , so I thought I 'd better call you . This bird just stands here and says he knows Foltz is here and he wants to see him . That 's all he says . " " What 's his name ? " " Deerudy or something like that . " " Hold the wire . " Maguire left the receiver dangling and went to the inner room . In a few minutes he came back to the telephone . " Cummings ? Listen . We want that man here at StationH . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He 's got his own car . He wants to know if you 've got Foltz there . " " To hell with what he wants . His own car is all right , but you 'd better send a man with him to make sure that he gets here . " At 11:50 they arrived . The inside office was much denser with smoke than it had been before , and everyonelooked weary and irritated and their eyes werep226bloodshot . They had been about ready to call it off for the night when the call had come from the deputy warden . De Roode walked in with the jail keeper trailinghim , swept the room with a swift glance , and stopped at the table . Sherwood demanded , " Well ? What did you go to the jail and ask for Foltz for ? " De Roode 's mouth worked . He controlled it . Brissenden barked , " You got a tongue ? " De Roode said , " I want to see him . Where is he ? " " In bed asleep . I suppose he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in jail ? What 's the idea ? " De Roode said , " You have him here . I want to see him . " Brissenden stood up . " Damn you , will you answer a question ? " Apparently he would n't . Not , at least , until his own had been answered to his satisfaction . He wanted to know where Foltz was , and Brissenden 's snarls seemed to have no effect on his desire . Finally Sherwood told him in dreary exasperation : " Look here . If you can understand plain English , Foltz is in bed at Birchhaven , as far as we know . We left him there . Maybe we should have locked him up , but we did n't . Where did you get the idea we did ? Who told you ? " " No one told me . " De Roode 's massive chest expandedlike a heavyweight prizefighter 's as he took a deep breath . " I went to Birchhaven at six o'clock to take him some things , and he told me about the gloves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you did this afternoon , about his jacket and gloves in it.  |p227But  you are wrong . " He looked around slowly at the faces . " I say you are all wrong ! Mr. Martin did n't do it ! " " Did n't do what ? " " He did n't kill Mr. Storrs . " " Who the hell said he did ? What did he tell you about the gloves ? " " He said you had found them , and they were his gloves , and they had been used to kill Mr. Storrs . " " Right . What about it ? " " That was all . But I could sec that he was worried , I could see that he expected something . I went home . But at ten o'clock I could n't go to bed without seeing him again . You understand , I have cared for him for many years . I went back to Birchhavcn . The trooper in the hall told me that everyone had gone up , except Mrs. Storrs and Mr. Ranth in the study . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was no answer . 1 went in , and he was not there . I went to Mr. Zimmerman 's room , and he was not there . I went down to the study and asked Mrs. Storrs , and she did not know . So I knew you must have taken him , on account of the gloves . 1 thought you would take him to the jail , and I went there ! ' De Roode straightened his slumping shoulders . " Where is he ? " " For the love of Mike . " Sherwood was disgusted . " He 's human , he was probably in the bathroom . " " No . I looked . " " Well , he was somewhere . You 're a fathead . I thought maybe . . . what does it matter what I thought ? " Sherwood turned to the trooper on a chair by the door . " You might as well call Birchhaven and tell the man there to see about Foltz . See if he 's in his room . Tell him to call back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up and stretched thoroughly , with a cavernous yawn . " You 're coming with me , Inspector ? That 's better than going back to New York ; you would n't get more than three hours ' sleep if you 're going to be out here at eight o'clock . " The others moved and looked for hats . Maguire was muttering to the man from the jail . The attorneygeneralspoke darkly to Brissenden , who nodded a scowlingagreement . Inspector Cramer crossed to the table and helped Sherwood get his papers gathered up and deposited in his brief case . No one paid any attention to de Roode . They talked desultorily , then straggled towards the outer room . The phone rang , and the trooper answered it . He talked a brief minute , then hung up and turned to his superiors . " Hurley says Foltz is in his room , in bed . " " Did he go in ? Did he see him ? " " Yes , sir . He went in , and Foltz was sore because he had waked him up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Sherwood turned and saw de Roode . " Did you hear that ? He 's in bed asleep , where we all ought to be . Except you , you ought to be in jail yourself , anyone as bright as you are . Come on , Inspector . " Sylvia slept . She had not expected to ; she had not slept Saturday night . And now , at ten o'clock Sundayp229evening , the turmoil in her head and breast was surely in worse confusion than it had been twenty-four hours before ; there had been the discovery of the gloves , which she had herself bought ; the grotesque proposal of Steve Zimmerman  --  she could not forget his eyes ; the detached imperturbability of Martin when she told him about Steve , not like Martin at all ; and Dol 's antics which she would not explain . So , though Sylvia went upstairs early because the others did , she dreaded the ' long dark hours of futile resentment at the net of grief and apprehension and suspense that she was tangled in . In fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed to pajamas , performed a minimum of toilet ceremonies , got into bed , and turned out the light . Tired young nerves , which in twenty years had had littleoccasion for the development of detours and blockadesin their canals , demanded respite and got it . By 10:30 she was sound asleep . The trooper named Hurley , in the reception hall , did not have as tiresome a night of it as might have been expected by a man who had been assigned to watch over a sleeping household . There was the interruption by de Roode , coming and going , by Mrs. Storrs and Ranth leaving the study and going upstairs some time after eleven , and , at midnight , the phone call from Station H and his resulting expedition to Foltz 's room . It was half an hour after that that another little diversion offereditself . He had just returned to the hall after a trip to the terrace for a cigarette , when there came faintly from the floor above the sound of knocking . He listened , and after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little whether it was any of his business , finally decided that it might be , since Sergeant Quill had given him a pencil diagram showing which rooms the various guests were occupying , and mounted the stairs . He had turned off the hall light after his visit to Foltz 's room , and now switched it on again . No one was visible in the corridor to the right , and he turned the corner to the other hall . Halfway down its length a man stood , and Hurley saw it was the big guy who the sergeant had told him had been drinking all afternoon , by name Chisholm . Hurley walked down the hall to him , quiet on tiptoe but assured . He had been feeling a little out of his element on night post in a house like this , but a drunk was a drunk anywhere . He spoke in a rough undertone . " Who you looking for ? " Len Chisholm leaned against the jamb of the door he had presumably been knocking on , raised his brows superciliously and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come on , what do you want ? " Len left the jamb in order to get his lips within ten inches of the trooper 's ear , and whispered as one conspiratorto another , " Sit down and I 'll tell you . Let 's both sit down . " Hurley grunted , " You 're pie-eyed . What do you want with Zimmerman at this time of night ? " Len attempted a frown , but it would n't stay in place . He leaned to the jamb again and abandoned the whis/per for a rumble . " Zimmerman ? " He was scornful . " I would n't speak to that runt if you offered it to me on a silver platter . " " What are you knocking on his door for ? " " I 'm not knocking on his door . I intend to visit Miss Bonner . The only job I have ever cared for . " " This is Zimmerman 's room . " " What ! " Len turned and peered intently at the door 's upper left panel , his nose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By God , it is . " He wheeled unsteadily . " I am not in the habit of going into rooms occupied by men in the dead of night . You can take my word for that . My mistake . " He propelled himself forward by placing his back against the door jamb and using it for purchase , abruptly brushed past the trooper , and was off down the hall , tacking some but by no means staggering . Hurley followed him , muttering , " ' Thank ( god he can navigate . I 'd hate to lug that lump of meat . " There proved to be no occasion even for steering it . I , en turned the corner into the main corridor without mishap , proceeded to the door of his own room , opened it , passed through , and shut it with a bang . The trooper grimaced as the door banged , gazed at it a second , and then turned and went back downstairs . The banging of Len 's door a little after 12:30 may or may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was sleeping too soundly ,  --  but it was heard quite distinctly by Dol Bonner , because her room was not far away from Len 's , across the main corridor , and she was not asleep at all . She had not even un- dressed . She sat at the little table between two windows and put things down on paper , or on the window-seat with her knees up and her chin resting on them , or paced the floor in her stocking feet , frowning at a chaos which she could not shape . She did harder thinking between ten and two o'clock that night than she had ever done in her life  --  most of it abortive , some of it painful , and none of it conclusive . Most of the first hour was spent at the table with pencil and paper , setting down individual schedules for Saturday afternoon , theories with pros and cons , probabilitiesbalanced against implausibles . At length she saw that she would never get anywhere that way ; there were too many hypotheses and permutations . She went and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had told . Should she go now to Janet 's room and have it out with her ? She had been tempted , as soon as she learned that Janet had lied , to confront her with it and demand the truth . She still was . But still she held back . She wanted first to have the possibilities well enough arranged in her head so that , if Janet sought refuge in another lie , it would not be gulped down so easily as the first one had been . Also there was the likelihood that Janet would simply stand pat and refuse to elucidate at all , in which case it was better that she should not know that her lie had been detected . And in addition , the Janet business was extremely ticklish anyway and already perhaps bungled beyond repair . The only pressure that could have been applied to her no longer existed , and Dol could have kicked herself for her quixotic impulsivenessp233in wiping the fingerprints from the watermelon . Granted the humanity of her desire to keep Janet out of it , surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for instance , she could have hid that melon somewhere , and cut a hole in another one and substituted it . Sherwood and Brissenden - had been indignantthat she had wiped off the melon because it containedno fingerprints ; if they knew that what she had done was to remove the prints of the person who had actually cached the gloves . . . All of which was particularly pertinent and vital becausethe certainty that Janet had lied , and the most obvious inference to be drawn from it , put a new face on the whole matter and made it seem extremely likely that the destruction of those fingerprints might prove to have been a major mistake . And even if that inference was wrong , any other possible inference from Janet 's lie was equally pregnant with perplexity . Dol felt incompetent , bewildered , exasperated , and determined . She could not go to bed and go to sleep . In the morning those men would be back here . They did n't even know about Janet and her lie , nor about Zimmerman 's strange and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's camouflaged infatuation . But they would be here ; and , for one thing , they might lose patience with Zimmerman 's obduracy and take him away and lock him up . They might do anything . . . . During those four hours from ten till two , sitting at the table , or on the window-seat , or pacing back and forth in her stockings , various noises came to Dol in thep234night-still house . Steps in the upstairs hall , the voice of Ranth saying goodnight , presumably to Mrs. Storrs , faintly the ring of the telephone bell in the card room which was beneath her ; then , later , more footsteps , and after an interval again more , and the loud banging of Len 's door . It was still later by an hour , around 1:30 , that she again heard footsteps , this time on the gravel outdoors , and she went to the open window and leaned out . After a moment she made out a form below on the path , then a round blotch that could only have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice came up , " All right , ma'am , patrol . " Her nerves were ragged . She blurted , " Well , patrol on the grass , " and withdrew herself from the night . She went to the bathroom , having her own , got a drink of water , and came back and sat on the edge of the bed . They would almost certainly take Zimmerman . They might take more than him . She sat with her shoulders drooping , her eyes half closed with weariness , her brow wrinkled in miserable uncertainty . She had tried to pull the thing together in her mind , and it was no good ; or if in fact it was , what in the name of heaven was she to do next ? Should she drop the whole darned thing , empty it out of her mind , confess herself licked ? No . She sat for a while merely hanging on to that no . Her teeth came together and she stood up . This was no earthly use ; her mind was played out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if they did take Zimmerman away in the morning , she would be blocked , and all she could do then would be to go to Sherwood and spill the whole thing to him , including Janet 's story and the liep235in it , and the truth about the prints on the melon . In that case , she must do something now . She looked at her wrist ; it was two o'clock ; they would be here in six hours . It still might be best to have a try at Janet  --  but she tossed her head impatiently , surely she had consideredthat enough  --  if she knew Janet half as well as she thought she did , that would be a mistake . All right , then the only thing left was Zimmerman . She had two levers to use on him , if her main supposition was cor rect , and time itself , and suspense , must have worn him down a little , not to mention the fermentation made manifest by his proposal to Sylvia . Good . Zimmerman . She felt relieved and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could n't possibly look worse , and that therefore dabs at betterment would n't repay the trouble . At the door she turned the knob quietly but firmly , pulled on it , and was in the hall . She left her door standing open to have the light , and went to the widening of the corridor at the head of the stairs , and turned the corner . Here it was much darker , quite dark , and she stood a moment for the adjustment of her eyes . She moved when she could see well enough to distinguish a break in the wall for a door-frame , and at the first one on the left she paused ; that was an empty room behind a locked door , left vacant by the departureof P. L. Storrs ; the next would be Zimmerman 's ; she followed the wall to it , located the doorpanelwith her fingertips , and with her knuckles tapped on it gently , and waited . No sound came . She tapped again , and still there was no response . She had no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the downstairs hall , so she quietly turned the knob , learned that the door was not locked by its give to her tentative pressure , and pushed it open and entered . Her lowvoiced " Steve . Steve ! " got no more response than had the tapping . Thinking , " He certainly can sleep , " she softly shut the door and heard it click , then turned to address the darkness in a louder tone , " Steve ! It 's Dol Bonner . " No reply ; and all at once she knew that the room was much too still , too still even for the peace of sleep ; it was as still as death . The room was empty . Her heart thumped and she turned and groped with her fingers on the wall beside the door , found the switch , and flipped it on . Then she turned to look , and stood transfixed , with no blink in her stare for the sudden flood of light . For seconds she did n't move , and when she did it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door knob , but she could n't find it that way . She turned and grasped it , and the hold on it steadied her . She opened the door gently , and from the hall closed it gently behind her . She stood and caught a tremulous breath that was almost a sob , and that too seemed to help ; then she glided back to the main corridor , passed through the door she had left open into her own room , found her oxfords on the floor by the window-seat , and sat there and put them on with trembling hands impossible to control . She went to the corridor again and descended the stairs to the reception hall . The trooper , there on a chair , arose in surprise at the appearance of this fullyp237dressed young woman at something after two in the morning . Dol said in a shaky voice , " Come upstairs . There 's a man dead up there . "  |p238Thus  it happened that the high command resumed operations on the Birchhaven affair five hours before the time they had appointed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There 's three ways to account for the cord being tied in a double knot like that around his throat . One would be if he did it himself . He might . Another would be if the guy that did it was so powerful that he could pin him down on the bed and hold him down with his knees and do as he damn pleased , only in that case he 'd have to choke him with one hand to keep him from yelling while he tied the knot with the other . The third would be if you got the cord tight around his throat and kept it there until he was unconscious , and then tied the knot to make it good . Offhand , I like that way best . Almost anyone could do that if he wanted to bad enough . " " I do n't know . I do n't see how . " Sherwood , unkempt and bleary-eyed , was glowering down at the body of Steve Zimmerman which , since it would not be moved until Doc Flanner arrived , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head dangling over the edge , and the electric cord from the night lamp taut with a double knot around its throat . " Say he 's lyingthere asleep , how are you going to get the cord around him , and pulled tight , before he has a chance to let out a yell ? You 're not going to poke it under his238p239neck like you might a wire . Do you think he would n't yell ? " " Maybe he would n't have time to . Look . " The inspectorpointed at the wall near the floor , to the right of the head of the bed . " That 's the outlet that cord was plugged into , it 's the only one close enough . Ordinarily , of course , the cord passes from the lamp along the wall behind the bed to reach the outlet . But let 's say you were thoughtful enough to make preparations . You could come in here ahead of time , detach the cord from the outlet , go to the lamp and pull the cord to you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and plug it in again . Then where the cord crosses the bed you tuck it under the edge of the pillows , and if the bed is turned down and ready to get into , who 's going to see it ? Nobody , unless he happens to move the pillows , which is a chance you take . Later , when he 's asleep and you come back , you do n't have to poke it under his neck , it 's already under . All you have to do is quietly remove the cord from the outlet , and ' you 've got him . " " You have if you 're quick enough and strong . enough . " Cramer shook his head . " You do n't have to be a giant . If you once get that cord crossed on his throat , and a good hold on it , and enough grit to hang on for about a minute in spite of hell , he could n't do a damn thing but bounce around on the bed and claw at you , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it 's an instinct when something 's tight around your throat . Then when he quiets down on account of lack of air , you can tie all the knots you want to . " P240Brissenden , standing at the foot of the bed , growled , " Fingerprints on the plug and the outlet . " " Sure , try for ' em . I doubt it . Everybody is **29;4592;TOOLONG . You notice that melon did n't have any  --  at least , let 's hope it did n't . There 's one thing I observed that seems to support my guess as to how it was done . " The inspector stepped closer to the dangling head with the purple face and the protruding tongue , and bent over it . " Look here , Sherwood . See that mark across the side of his neck , half an inch from where the cord is now ? Two things about that . First , it 's another indication against suicide , the others being that it would be a world 's record for a guy to tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he would n't be likely to throw that pillow on the floor and muss up the bed like that . If he did tie his own knot , there would be no reason for another mark like that alongside it . Whereas , if it happened like my guess , the preliminary strangling would make a mark , and then the cord might get shifted when he pulled it tight again with the knot . Of course , that does n't settle it . He may have had a crack on the head first to knock him out . How soon is your doctor coming ? " " Let 's get out of here . " Sherwood , stooping to look at the mark obedient to Cramer 's suggestion , had straightened up with a shudder . " Flanner should be here any minute . There 's nothing more here you want , is there ? " He held his hand to his mouth , swallowed twice , mastered the crisis , and turned . " Quill , you tend to Doc and the men doing the pictures and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall . We 'll be downstairs . All right , Colonel ? " Brissenden grunted assent . " Tell ' em about that plug and outlet . Cover the whole room . " He strode behind Sherwood and Cramer to the door , and out . In the main corridor a trooper who was standing there stopped them . He spoke to Brissenden : " Mrs. Storrs has gone downstairs , sir . What about the rest of them ? " " Everyone is to get dressed . No one is to leave the house . " " Yes , sir . " Below , in the reception hall , was a group , all in uniform with holsters and cartridge belts . Brissenden sent two of them up to join Quill , and another pair to find the men outdoors on patrol , relieve them and send them in . Sergeant Talbot was dispatched to the card room with telephone calls to make . It was learned that Mrs. Storrs was not awaiting them there , but had gone with Belden , who had dressed himself to perfection in four minutes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ command proceeded to the card room . It was lit ; Talbot was on the stool at the telephone stand ; and one of the chairs at the table was occupied . Brissenden , seeing that , scowled . Sherwood motioned Cramer to a chair , sat down himself , and took out a handkerchief and thoroughly wiped his face ; he had been too infuriated to stop to wash when the phone call had got him out of bed . He said , " This is Inspector Cramer of New York . Miss Bonner . " Dol nodded .   " Oh , you 're the one that found the gloves in the watermelon . " Cramer got out a cigar . " Do n't be alarmed , I 'm not going to light it . Neat piece of work . I understand you 're a detective . " " Thank you . I run a licensed agency . " Dol shifted her eyes to Sherwood . " I 'm here because I found Zimmermanwhen I went in his room and I thought you 'd like to ask me about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minute 's silence , gazingat her . Finally he asked , " What did you go to his room for ? " " To ask him something . " Dol touched the black spot on her cheek with the tip of her finger . " Maybe I can save you time and a lot of questions . I was in my room from ten o'clock until two o'clock , without leaving it , and no one else entered it . I did n't undress because I was thinking about this case , and I had an idea 1 might solve it before you did . I did n't know what you might do in the morning , you might even make an arrest , and I knew if I was going to get anywhere I had better not lose any time . I decided that my best bet was to see Zimmerman and try to get out of him what he went to Storrs ' office for Saturday morning , and what happened there . If I waited until morning I might not get a chance at him . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened the door , and when I called his name and there was no answer , I turned on the light and saw him on the bed . Then I went downstairs and told the trooper . " " Why did you think we were going to arrest Zimmer-man ? "   " Because he would n't talk . " " Where did you get the idea you might solve this case before we did ? " " I just got it . I guess finding the gloves had puffed me up . " A windy snort came from Brissenden . Sherwood observeddrily , " You seem to have a knack for finding corpses . When you found Storrs Saturday you kept it to yourself while you went to the tennis court to study humannature . Did you try that tonight ? After you found Zimmerman did you go to your room to get it solved before you let us in on it ? Or somebody else 's room ? " " No . " Dol touched the black spot again . " I do n't see why you bother with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I found him . I went to my room first to put on my shoes , because I was in my stocking feet and I did n't want to go downstairs that way . " There was an ejaculation from Inspector Cramer . Sherwood glanced at him inquiringly , but he shook his head . " Nothing . It just occurred to me what she must save on smelling-salts . " An interruption came from the door ; it opened and Mrs. Storrs entered . In a pink negligee and slippers , with her hair gathered under a contraption at the back of her head and the night grease imperfectly removed from her colorless skin , she was not a joyous sight . She approached the table and told Sherwood : " So you 're back here . You needed more facts , and one has been furnished you . All this in my house . " There was a faint hissing as she breathed in. " 1 came to tell you that I misled you yesterday . I was lost in darkness . And to tell you that Belden will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want it . " " Thank you , Mrs. Storrs . You mean that you no longer believe that Ranth killed your husband ? " " I mean what I say . I misled you . I think you should know that I am no longer in the sphere that holds you . I have nothing to tell you . All . . . all this in my house . " She turned to go . Sherwood stopped her , but got nothing for it . He did manage to elicit a statement that she had left the study with Ranth and gone up to her room a little after eleven o'clock , but he had already learned that from his brief questioning of Hurley upon arrival . As regarded this second item in the cycle of destruction , Mrs. Storrs had heard nothing and seen nothing , and knew nothing . As the door closed behind her departure , Cramer bit deeper in his cigar and muttered to Brissenden , " There seems to be an unusual assortment of women here . " The colonel grunted hearty agreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sent to bring Len Chisholm . A trooper entered and reported that Doc Flanner and the photographer had both arrived and were upstairs , and that the man was back from Foltz 's place with de Roode . Sherwood instructed him to tell Talbot that he would take de Roode first , before Chisholm . Then he informed Dol that he would send for her when he needed her again . Dol said without moving , " Look , Mr. Sherwood . One of three things about me . Either I 'm engaged on the other side and not to be trusted , or I 'm a feeble-mindedP245female freak and just a nuisance , or I really do want this case solved and might possibly have another piece of luck like finding the gloves . Which do you think ? " Sherwood frowned at her . " Which do you ? " " I want the case solved . I have no other interest that might interfere with it . Once yesterday I thought I might have , but now I know I have n't . I have . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the other hand they may , under certain circumstances , prevent a mis-take . " " What ideas ? Do you think you know who killed Zimmerman ? " " No , not so I can say it . Not so it 's any good . I have to find out , for instance , why you sent for de Roodeoh , here he is . I 'll know now . " Sherwood , still frowning at her , finally shrugged and turned to the newcomer , but before he got further than a survey of him there was another interruption  --  Belden arriving with the coffee . The butler filled steaming cups , passed a tray heaped with sandwiches , distributed plates and napkins , and bowed himself out as from a socialtable of bridge . Sherwood said : " Well , de Roode , we 've got you . " The man stood with his head bent as though in weariness , but Dol could see the cord of muscle at the side of his neck and the gleam of his hostile and careful eyes as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what you mean , you 've got me . You sent for me . " " And you know why . Do n't you ? " " No. "  | " You do n't . Down at the barracks you said that you came to Birchhaven around ten o'clock to see Foltz , and you left a little after ten-thirty . Is that right ? " " Yes . " " And when you did n't find Foltz in his room you went to Zimmerman 's room ? " " Yes . " " What did you do in there ? " " I asked Mr. Zimmerman if he knew where Mr. Martin was , and he said he did n't . Then we talked a little , and I came out . " " You must have talked quite a while , and you thinkingFoltz was in jail and wanting to see him so badly . The trooper says you were upstairs between twenty and thirty minutes . What was Zimmerman doing when you left ? " " He was in bed . " " What was he doing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't doing anything . He was sitting up in bed talking . But . . . " " But what ? " " Nothing . I was only going to say , he got out of bed . Because when I left his room I . stood in the hall a minute , deciding what to do , and I heard him locking the door on the inside . " There were grunts from Brissenden and Cramer . Sherwood demanded , " You what ? " He scowled . " You do n't mean that . " " I do mean it . " De Roode remained imperturbable . " I heard him turning the key . " P247Sherwood sighed . " In that case , it looks like the next thing is to arrest you for Zimmerman 's murder . " De Roode 's chin went up . " He  --  " He stopped , his eyes boring into the attorney 's gaze . He said gruffly from his throat , " He has n't been murdered . " " Yes , he has . He 's up there now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way I left him . If I had left him murdered , he could n't have got up and locked the door after I was out of the room . " " Certainly he could n't . And no one else could have got in afterwards to kill him . And the door was unlocked when Miss Bonner went to his room at two o'clock . So you did n't hear him lock it . So you 're lying . Got that straight in your mind ? You might as well come clean with it , de Roode . What did you do it for ? " The man made no reply . Dol could see the swelling of the cord of muscle on his neck , and the slow lift of his powerful shoulders as he took in air long and deep . It seemed minutes before the shoulders began to sink again . When they had reached bottom he said , not as a challenge nor yet as a surrender : " If you think I murdered him , arrest me . " " What did you do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Was that it ? " " Arrest me . " " Why did you say you heard him lock the door ? " " Arrest me . " Sherwood leaned back . Cramer muttered , " Uh-huh , you 've gagged him . That 's the way it goes sometimes . "   But to an explosive suggestion from Brissenden the inspectorobjected , " Not a chance . Look at his mouth , he 'd wear out a squad . " He did wear out Sherwood . He did no more talking . The attorney fired questions at him , tried to browbeat him , reasoned with him , but Cramer was right , de Roode had been gagged . He said " Arrest me , " or said nothing , not even bothering to shake his head . Finally the attorneytold the trooper : " Take him out and have one of the men keep him . De Roode , you 're being held as a material witness . Do n't let anybody talk to him . Send Chisholm in . " Brissenden watched them go and then growled , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be alive now and we would have got it out of him today . I say that Talbot ought to take that bird down to the barracks and work on him . I want it on record that I say that . " " Okay . " Sherwood gulped his cup of coffee , now lukewarm . " I 'm not trying to make a record , I 'm trying to stop this damn massacre . " He poured hot coffee and sipped at that . " He can take him - later if it looks that way . First let 's see what we 've got . What we have n't got is motive , and we ca n't get a line on any . Why in the name of God would de Roode want to murder P. L. Storrs ? Or Foltz ? Or even Chisholm ? We have a motive for Ranth , but where would Zimmerman fit into that ? And if de Roode did hear Zimmerman lock the door , how did Ranth get in the room ? If de Roode did it himself , why did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and why did he kill Zimmerman , and why the devil did he kill Storrs ? And if the two jobsP249were done by different people , who were they and why did they do it ? " Sherwood glared at Dol . " What about it , Miss Bonner ? How are the ideas coming ? You wanted to know why I sent for de Roode . Because he heard Zimmerman lock his door . How do you like that ? " But Dol had no opportunity to tell how she liked it . Len Chisholm came in . From the standpoint of elegance , he was a wreck . Dol , looking at him , thought , " They might at least have brushed some of the cigarette ashes off of him , . " His tie was on one side , his shirt needed tucking in , and his face was either comic or heroic , as it might move you , with a desperate dignity . He ignored the men and squinted at Dol . " Oh . So there . . . there you are . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant it for a friendly question . Dol said nothing . He frowned at her , gave her up , and turned to the men . " My God . Are you fellows still here ? " He pointed an accusing finger , not too steady , at Cramer , who was in the chair Maguire of Bridgeport had occupied twelve hours before . " You 've been monkeying with your nose . It 's not the same nose at all . 1 ) o you know Cyrano de Bergerac ? Let 's hear you say it , Cyrano de Bergerac . " He abruptly shifted to Sherwood . " Mind if I sit down ? " Cramer grunted in disgust . " You might as well ask questions of a weegie board . Is this the one your man found knocking on Zimmerman 's door ? " " Yeah . And the one who saw Storrs asleep on the bench Saturday afternoon . " " Huh . He gets around . " Cramer chewed on his cigar ,   and watched Len 's elaborate performance of lowering himself into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he 's good . If you let him sleep it off he 'll claim he ca n't remember anything . If you duck him he 'll have a fit . " Sherwood stared at Len . " Look here , Chisholm . Do you know what your name is ? " " Certainly . " Len smiled at him indulgently . " Do you ? " " How drunk are you ? " " Well . . . " Len 's brow wrinkled . " I 'll tell you . I 'm too drunk to drive a car . I 've got too much sense . But I 'm not too drunk to know where I am . I know exactly where I am . " " That 's fine . " Sherwood sounded encouraging . " Then you probably know where you 've been , too . For instance , when you went to Zimmerman 's room . What did you do in there ? " Len shook his head emphatically . " You must mean my room . You 're mixed up . You must mean what did I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean Zimmerman 's room . The one around the corner from yours , in the other hall . More than two hours ago you went there in the dark and knocked on the door . Remember ? And the trooper came up and spoke to you , and you told him you thought it was Miss Bonner'sroom ? And before the trooper came , you turned the knob of that door to open it ? That 's why you ought to be able to remember whether the door was locked . Just concentrate on that : was the door locked ? " Len looked cunning and superior . He waved a hand . " I see what you 're doing . You 're trying to get me top . P251compromise Miss Bonner . It 's a fallacy . If Miss Bonner 's door was locked , how would Zimmerman get in ? " He frowned . " That 's not what I mean . I mean how would I get in . And I did n't get in . That 's why I say you must mean my room . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Sure you did . But that door you were knocking on  --  when you tried to open it was it locked ? " Len shook his head . " You do n't understand anything . There would n't be any use trying to open a door if it was locked . It would n't do you any good . " " Okay . " Sherwood sighed . He leaned forward and demanded abruptly , " What did you have against Zimmerman ? Why did you hate him ? " " Hate who ? " " Steve Zimmerman . " " Oh . Him . " Len nodded . " That runt . " " Why did you hate him ? " " I do n't know . I never stop to think why when I hate anybody . Hell , I do n't like you either . " " Did you kill Zimmerman ? Did you strangle him with that cord ? " Len squinted at him . " You do n't mean Zimmerman . It was n't him that was strangled , it was Storrs . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " Len looked disgusted . " Did you ? " Sherwood sighed . He turned : " Do you want to try this a while , Inspector ? " Cramer grunted . " I 'd hate to offend him . I mighttry . " He came around and stood in front of Len 's chair . He had about the same amount of success as the attor- ney . Whether Len 's elusiveness was the sharp cunning of a man defending himself against peril , or merely what it seemed to be , an excess of alcohol causing a cerebral traffic jam , the effect was the same . He slid down the question marks like an ant down a corkscrew . Cramer , after ten minutes of it , was ready to call it off when a trooper entered with the information that the doctor was ready to report . Sherwood nodded at Chisholm . " Take this man and put him in his room and keep him there , and see that there are n't any bottles around . Do n't let him out until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , if he 'll eat . Tell Talbot to send another man down to the entrance , it 'll soon be daylight . As soon as I get through with Flanner I want to see Foltz . " Len said , " There 's a butler in this house that tends to the bottles . " But he got up and went , without protest and without ceremony , more unsteadily than he had entered , not permitting the trooper 's hand on his arm . " That 's the last you 'll get out of him , " Cramer declared . " When he comes to again he 'll be a blank . " Sherwood said in a voice too weary to be savage , " I know I 'd like to roll him on a barrel . Damn it , I 've got to get some sleep . Only four hours last night , and now tonight  --  hello , Doc . What about it ? " Doctor Flanner 's report was brief . To all appearances , death by strangulation , with a remote chance of any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas of pressure , one where the cord was fastenedby the knot and the other evidenced by a mark below that , apparently caused by a previous pressure P253from the same or a similar cord . Both areas well beneath the hyoid bone . No contusions or other external evidence of violence except the strangulation . Been dead from three to five hours . The attorney nodded . " Much obliged . I 'll phone you some time before noon , we may have to postpone the Storrs inquest . " The doctor gone , he turned to Dol Bonner . " I 'd like to ask you something . After you took the trooper upstairs and showed him what you had found , in between that and the time we got here , which was about half an hour later , did you happen to see Chisholm and tell him what had happened ? Was he in his room ? " " I do n't know . I did n't see him . I went to Miss Raffray'sroom to wake her and tell her about it , and stayed there with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . " " You did n't . " Sherwood put up his brows at her . Then , at an intrusion , he turned . It was Martin Foltz . The attorney put sharp eyes on him . " Sit down , please , Mr. Foltz . " Martin was visibly agitated  --  chiefly , it appeared , with anger . His voice trembling , he burst out at Sherwood , " My man de Roode is out there and they wo n't let me speak with him ! They say by your orders ! Outrageousinsolence ! " " Calm down a little . " Sherwood patted the air . " Your man de Roode is under arrest . " " Under arrest for what ? " " We call it , detained as a material witness . Sit down , Foltz . You ought to know better than to start shooting off about insolence . If you insist on it nobody can stop you , but it wo n't get you anywhere . Sit down . "   Martin stood . His mouth twitched . Finally he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I have a right to know what 's going on . Steve Zimmerman was my oldest friend . They would n't let me in to see him . " " Do you know what happened to him ? " " Yes . " Martin 's mouth twitched again . He controlled it . " Miss Raffray told me . I . . . they would n't let me in the room . I have a right to know . . . " " Sure you have , " Sherwood agreed . " I know , you 've had a shock . So have I. If you can pull yourself together enough to be seated in that chair . . . thanks . Probably you already know as much as we do , if Miss Raffray told you what Miss Bonner told her . Zimmerman was strangledwith an electric light cord some time between ten and two o'clock . Murdered . Miss Raffray told you that ? " " Yes . " " Okay . So I 'm trying to find out what different peoplewere doing around here , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and succinct , but no one else . Mrs. Storrs is congenitally obscure . Your man de Roode is either a liar or a murderer or both . Chisholm is either drunk or foxy . I am hoping you 'll take after Miss Bonner . The man that was here tells me that you went upstairs with Miss Raffray around nine-thirty and did n't come down again . Is that right ? " " No . " Martin clipped the word . " I went up with Miss Raffray , but I came down again . " " The devil you did . When ? " " It must have been around ten o'clock , or a little later . I talked with Miss Raff ray a few moments at the doorP255of her room , and then went to my room . I walked up and down and smoked a couple of cigarettes , trying to quiet my nerves . I have n't got the kind of nerves a man ought to have . I never have had . It affects my stomach too , when I 'm upset , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I thought of going down to phone de Roode to bring some over , but if I did that I would have to pass that trooper in the hall again , and I did n't want to . I hated his being there and what it meant , and anything I hate has a bad effect on me . " Martin fluttered a hand . " You would n't understand that , you have n't got my nerves . I had n't slept Saturday night , and I knew I would n't sleep with my stomach like that , and I might not anyway . I went down the back stairs to the kitchen , and got some baking soda and a spoon -- and a glass . I opened the door and went out to smoke a cigarette , because it calms me down to smoke outdoors more than it does with walls around me . I returned to my room and took the soda and went to bed , and I had just managed to get to sleep  --  at least that was how it seemed  --  when that damned trooper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He said you had phoned to ask if I was in my room . I took some more soda , but I could n't go to sleep again , and I was awake when Miss Itaffray came to tell me what Miss Bonner had told her . " Martin stopped , took out a handkerchief and wiped his forehead , and crumpled the handkerchief tight in his hand . He said , " I . . . I hope I made it lucid and succinct . " Sherwood nodded . " Thanks . When you went down to the kitchen did you see anyone ? " " There was no one there . " it " On the stairs or in the hall ? " " No . " " Did you leave your room except for that trip down-stairs ? " " No . " " Did you hear any noises before the trooper knocked on your door ? " " I heard footsteps . It sounded like Mrs. Storrs , she walks on her heels . I heard a door dose , I think two doors . That was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up , a long time after , I heard knocking , very low , and low voices , and then I heard a door bang . " " Any other noises ? Anything at all ? " " No . Nothing . Until later I heard footsteps and voices again . That must have been Miss Bonner and the trooper , because it was soon afterwards that Miss Rafray came to tell me . " " You heard no sounds from Ranth 's room ? It 's next to yours , between yours and Zimmerman 's . " Martin shook his head . " The closets are arranged here to separate the rooms , and Ranth is n't noisy . " Sherwood regarded him in silence . Then abruptly he demanded , " What was de Roode 's grudge against Zim-merman ? " Martin stared . The attorney waked . Martin said , " I do n't pretend to know what it 's about , this business about de Roode . You say you 're detaining him as a material witness and that he 's either a liar or a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the devil would he have a grudge against Steve Zimmerman ? "   " I. do n't know . I 'm asking you . " " All right , I 'm answering . He did n't . I have a right to know why you 're holding him ! " " Maybe , " Sherwood conceded sourly . " I 'm not particularlyexcited about your rights just at present . There 's been two men killed here . Did you know that de Roode came here last night a little after ten o'clock and went to Zimmerman 's room and stayed in there fifteen or twenty minutes ? " " No . Who told you that ? " " He did . Anyway , the man we had there in the hall was n't blind . De Roode says he came to see you and could n't find you , and went to Zimmerman 's room to see if you were there . Zimmerman was there and spoke to him , so de Roode was the last one , to see him alive . He says he left him alive . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't ? " " None at all . But it 's a cinch that someone did n't leave him alive , and besides , there 's another item in de Roode 's statement that does n't fit at all . I 'm saving that item , for the present . And I 'm holding de Roode . I f you want his rights attended to , get a lawyer . Just now I 'm more interested in other rights that have been violated  --  the rights of Storrs and Zimmerman to go on breathing . And the right of the people of the State of Connecticut to know who did the violating . There are a couple more questions I 'd like to ask , Mr. Foltz , and I put them to you as the closest and oldest friend of Steve Zimmerman . Do you know of any grievance that de Roode had against Storrs , or reason to fear him ? "   " No . " " Do you know of any motive that anyone here might have had for killing Zimmerman ? " " No . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was killed , or who did it ? " " No . " Sherwood leaned back . He pulled at the lobe of his ear , sighed , and finally turned an inquiring glance on the colonel and the inspector . Brissenden shrugged , and Cramer shook his head . Sherwood returned to Martin : " I guess that 's all for now , Mr. Foltz . Your man de Roode is under arrest and I do n't want him talking with anyone for the present . You of course are not , but I ask you to keep yourself within these grounds . If you wish to get a lawyer for de Roode , which does n't seem to me an urgent necessity , you may use the telephone or send a message by one of the men . " He shifted to the trooper : " Send Miss Storrs in . " Martin stood up . He looked at Dol as if he would say something , but ended by turning away wordless . He had Sylvia to go to , and Dol watched him go . Then , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permanentif this kept up much longer , she leaned back and dosed her eyes . She was wishing that she dared confront Janet with her lie here in front of these men and let them worry the truth out of her , but she knew she could not . It was too great a chance to take . That truth could not be worried out of Janet , it would have to be forced out . Somehow . . . If the illumination got from the others had beenp259scanty , that received from Janet Storrs and Sylvia Raffraywas considerably less than scanty . Ten minutes for each of them was enough . Janet , self-possessed , fully clothed and toileted , and inscrutable , said she had not left her room after entering it at something before ten o'clock , had gone to bed about midnight and lain awake , and had heard nothing of any significance . Sylvia , not toileted at all but with a steady chin , which Dol saw with relief and inward gratitude to heaven , had heard nothing , had slept almost from contact with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knock on her door . To questions regarding the possibility of a motive for de Roode to kill either Storrs.or Zimmerman , or both , she offered ignorance , reinforced by an obvious disbelief . Awaiting Ranth , Sherwood went to the window and stretched himself comprehensively ; outside was no longer a black opacity but a gray and dingy blur . Brissendenshifted in his chair and sent Dol a brief scowl , the thirtieth , perhaps , of a series . Cramer deposited a horriblymangled cigar in an ashtray and got out another one . George Leo Ranth entered and walked to the table , sat down and crossed his legs and looked patiently and politely receptive . Sherwood crossed from the window and stood frowning down at him with his hands thrust into his trouser pockets and his shoulders hunched up . " Well , Mr. Ranth . I suppose you know what we 're here for now . " Ranth nodded . " Mrs. Storrs told me . I am sorry . Violenceis inherent in all natural processes , but the kind of violence displayed in murder is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deplore this second manifestation of it , though it is an advantage to me as an individual . You had some reason to suppose me involved in the death of Mr. Storrs , but certainly not in that of Mr. Zimmerman , since I scarcely knew him . " " Yeah . Thank you for calling my attention to that . Of course out of all the possibilities we have to consider  --  if you killed Storrs and Zimmerman knew it , you might have had to remove him to protect yourself . That has been known to happen . " Ranth faintly smiled . " Nevertheless , it does complicatethings for you . It probably does in any event , even with all suspicion of me removed ; but on the other hand , it might simplify it for you by presenting fresh considerations . I should think it might . " Brissenden barked , " What does that mean ? What do you know about it ? " " Nothing . I know nothing . But pardon me , I believe there is one thing I do know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Zimmerman was found on his bed , strangledby an electric light cord around his throat ? " Sherwood grunted a yes . " Was that cord tied there against his struggles , or held against his struggles while he died ? Or was he first rendered unconscious by a blow or a narcotic ? " " I do n't know . I think he struggled . The bed looks like it . " " If he did  --  if he struggled  --  I do know one thing that may help , in case time is significant . I know that he was killed before II : 25 . At that time I went to my room , which is next to his . There are closets between the rooms , but my hearing is acute , and I did not go top261sleep . I went to bed and lay relaxed . The sound of two men struggling on that bed would surely have reached me . I heard other sounds plainly  --  for instance , quite late , a knocking that seemed to be on a door not far from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that followed by footsteps and the banging of a door . I also , as you probably know , heard the trooper and Miss Bonner ; at the agitation of their voices and movements I went to the hall to investigate . The trooper would not let me enter Zimmerman 's room . Miss Bonner had gone downstairs to get the men from outdoors . My assistance was not required  --  it appeared , not wanted . I re-entered my room and dressed . " Sherwood sat down . He eyed Ranth with no visible satisfaction or gratitude . Finally he grunted , " So that 's your story . I 'll be damned if you might n't think this is a deaf and dumb asylum . A man gets strangled in bed with the house full of people , and nobody saw anything or heard anything or even dreamed of anything . You put it that the fact that you heard nothing after I I : 25 proves that Zimmerman was killed earlier than that . It does n't at all ; it only proves that if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm not accusing you ; I tell you frankly that I have nothing whatever on which to base such an accusation . I 'd like to ask you this : have you anything to add to what you 've said that might help us ? Anything at all regarding events here , or anything you knew or suspected or that you now suspect ? " Ranth slowly shook his head . " Nothing whatever . " " Okay . That 's all . Please stay on the premises . " When Ranth had gone there was silence . Dol closedher eyes again , Sherwood sat with his chin on his chest ,   Cramer chewed his cigar and stared at the opposite wall . Brissenden stood up . " I 'm going to tell Talbot to take de Roode down to the barracks . " He licked his lips . The attorney nodded wearily . " Go ahead . I 'm not sanctioning anything but questioning of a suspect . Tell your men that . " " You would n't , " the colonel snorted contemptuously , and stalked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of cold coffee and gulped it down , coughed a couple of times , and replaced his cigar . He moved around and stood in front of Sherwood . Dol let her black lashes lift a little to see what he was doing , then dropped them again . " Well , " Cramer said , " you 're up against the same thing as you are with Storrs . Motive . That 's the place to dig , and I do n't see how I can help you any . I doubt if they 'll get anything out of that de Roode , granting that there 's anything to get . I suppose it has occurred to you that he may not be a liar or a murderer either one ; it could have happened , his visit to Zimmerman 's room , just the way he said it did . He might have heard Zimmermanlocking the door , provided that there was someonehid in Zimmerman 's room while de Roode was in there . Then after Zimmerman went to sleep the guy unhid himself , did the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take a rest , of course expecting to have until morning for that . He must have been exasperated when he was got out of bed again so soon afterwards . If it happened that way , it must have been Foltz or Chisholm , it could n't have been Ranth . If it was Ranth ,  |p263either  de Roode is lying or cuckoo about hearing the door locked , or Zimmerman himself unlocked it later ; maybe he went to the bathroom and neglected to lock it again when he went back . If de Roode did it , you 'll certainly have to find out why . " " Yeah . " Sherwood was forlornly sarcastic . " Much obliged . " " Do n't mention it . But there 's one little experiment we might try . We might satisfy our curiosity about that , if we do n't do anything else . Ranth said if there was any struggling on that bed after i t : 25 he would have heard it . I wonder if he would . I al. ; h wonder if it might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even Foltz 's . What do you say we shoo everybody downstairsand make a few tests ? " Sherwood dragged himself to his feet . Dol opened her eyes . Thus it was that the lovely and happy flush of dawn , as its rays reached the second story windows of Birchhaventhat September Monday morning , would surely have danced gaily with laughter if it had been blessed with a sense of humor and ignorant of the significance of the ludicrous antics to be observed there . First in Ranth 's room , then in Foltz 's , then in Dol Bonner 's , a woman and three grown men stood motionless and silent , in attitudes of strained attention , while , in the room from which Zimmerman 's body had been removed on its journey to the dissecting table , a 19o-pound trooper rolled on the bed and bounced up and down , rolled and bounced some more like a boy in exuberant play , while three of his comrades stood there and scowled at him .   Six hours later , at eleven o'clock , Dol Bonner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a cup of ' V hot tea and staring out at the sunny lawn . She had reached the conclusion that there was no safe detour for her , no trail that might be found or blazed to avoid the risk she must take ; she must either leap the crevasse or give it up . There had been a chance ; but when , around ten o'clock , de Roode had been brought back to Birchhaven by a couple of troopers and released from custody , that chance had disappeared . She had seen de Roode clamber out of the car and heard him demand to see Martin ; he had not , apparently , suffered mayhem , and he certainly did not look crushed . Sherwood , having departed at dawn , was now back again , as was Brissenden ; they were in the card room with Len Chisholm , who had informed the trooper stationedoutside his door that he had awakened , by a seriesof deep and lugubrious groans . Inspector Cramer was gone . Dol had not slept . She knew her head was not clear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dream , in appearance fair and cheerful , but with a sinister and threatening quality that could not be defined . And her brain was muddled . She knew it but could n't help it . She could not lie down and sleep . She must first leap that crevasse ; she knew that she must , all the hours that shep265had been shrinking from it . Those hours had begun when she had heard de Roode 's story in the card room ; she had been convinced then of what had before been only incredulous conjecture . With that conviction in her head it was not strange that she could not sleep . For one thing among others , she was tormented by the practical certainty that if she had gone to Zimmerman at ten o'clock , with what she had known then , instead of waitinguntil two , he would be alive now and it would all be over . Now there was no Zimmerman to go to , and that made the situation desperate . She had considered presenting Sherwood with her facts and surmises and leaving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his methods she doubted if he would be equal to the job  --  and now the job must be done . The murderer of Storrs and Zimmerman must be unmasked . She had considered a direct attack on de Roode with whatever weapons she might command , but dismissed that as hopeless . She had considered , again , the possibility of coercing Janet into disclosure , and had dismissed that too . One false step might be ruin , for when she once betrayed her knowledge all the defenses of cunning and despair would be erected against her , unless she demolishedthem in advance . So , finally , she was led to her decision . Her head still was not clear , but her determination was . She would take the jump . There was nothing else for it . She swallowed the last of her cup of tea , got up and went to the mirror and peered at her reflection and mutteredat it , " You look like something left on the **25;4623;TOOLONG neither poet nor imagist . He had merely written , yens he fore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his uncanny flair for the unusual , had ferreted out , dubbed imagistic , and insisted on printing in his anthology . Ile thought , for his part , that Miss Lowell too , on occasion , might easily turn out to be as good an imagist as he was , provided Ezra found it in his heart to say so publicly . Apparently , only one person in the world knew anything at all about imagist poetry , and that was Ezra Pound . He sat down , and a general laugh , in which Amy joined , ran around the table . Apparently Ezra 's allies were not , after all , so firm in his support . I had expected Miss Lowell to speak next , but she called upon Aldington to deliver himself as to imagism , since he had been one of the two cited by Hueffer as pure imagists , and since H. D. was too embarrassed to explain herself . Aldington thereuponarose and complained that he too , for his part , could not take this to be an imagist dinner . To him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Hellenic view of life , the worshipof concrete , sensuous , pagan beauty . He agreed with Mr. Upward that Miss Lowell might be an imagist , but he knew of others there present who were not . For example , Gaudier-Brzeska was no imagist , for he despised the Greeks as being the great introducers of naturalism into art . Would Gaudier explain why he hated the Greeks so much ? Gaudier now arose and stated , in fascinatingly broken English , that as a sculptor he wished to think of his work as primarilyconsisting of the stone block , organized into a form adapted to its own material . The Greeks had , after Phidias , tried to substitute for the stone block , a perfect reproduction of the ideal human body . Neither the Gothic cathedral builders , nor Michelangelo , nor any other great sculptor had ever been able to follow them , for the reason that this was not sculpture , but a superior kind of photography  --  and unsuited to its material to boot ! Aldington now countered with certain objections , and while these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had suddenly and noiselessly slipped out of the room . He had apparently gone out at the back , by the waiters ' entrance . The wrangle betweenGaudier and Aldington went on . Most of us were ceasing to pay attention to it , when there was a sudden scuffle at the back , by the waiters ' entrance , and in marched Ezra , flushed andP151disheveled , bearing upon his head a large till bathtub , of the old-fashioned round-edged variety , to the amazement and consternationof all present . Where he had obtained that bathtub , I do not know . Presumably , it had come down from the old hotel upstairs . Several waiters followed him , crowding to the doors to see what next would happen . Ezra carefully deposited the unwieldy object on the floor , swept back the dank , disheveled locks from his forehead , and addressed the gathering . He wished , he said , to make an important announcement . Since , according to Mr. Hueffer and Mr. Upward , he was an authority on all schools of poetry , he wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ longer called the " imagiste , " but the " nageiste , " school . This bathtub might be taken as their symbol . Miss Lowell had herself inaugurated this new school with her poem " In a Garden , " which had been included in the " Des Imagistes " anthology . Her poem had concludedwith the lines " Night , and the water , and you in your whiteness , bathing . " Hence this symbol was entirely appropriate to the new group . Here everybody again laughed , but I , for my part , felt thatPound had considerably overplayed his own intellectual arrogance . I anxiously eyed Miss Lowell . She did not appear in theleast disturbed . Ezra , she said , must have his little joke , andshe personally was glad of his interruption , as it brought to anend the discussion between Gaudier and Aldington , whichseemed to her to have little to do with poetry . As our hostess , she merely wished to thank us all for coming , and for her part , she was sure that , whether as " imagiste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " the new movement in poetry would go on . Ezra 's squib had fizzled out , after all . Everyone felt , as I did , that we now owed homage to the gallant spirit of this womanwho had brought us together , and who had maintained her position with unruffled dignity under the most difficult circumstances . The tin bathtub was forgotten ; two waiters , shortly after , boreit off into a neutral corner . The evening ended in a generaldisplay of high spirits , a good deal of it at Ezra 's own expense , which he was forced to bear as he best might , his face twitchingat every reference to his own wild West upbringing . As Amy hadalready informed me , Ezra was so spoilt that , on a recent occa- 52 lion , he had refused to go late at night to a London railroad station to greet his own parents , newly arrived from America , until she had shamed him by offering to go in his stead . I thereforehenceforth held him to be irresponsible , and began to shat e  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own career . In the handshake I gave her at the conclusion of this dinner there was already the understanding , warmth , and sympathyof a complete alliance . Although her poetry already owed much to mine , she was , I felt , welcome to whatever she had taken . It is difficult to recall all the crowded events and the emotionsof that particular July . In the first place , Sir Joseph Beecham , father of the brilliant conductor , had that summer leased Drury Lane Theatre , and in deliberate defiance of the Melba and Caruso nights at near-by Covent Garden , invited over from Paris the combined forces of the Russian opera and the Russian ballet . Though the latter organization was now without its chief star in the person of Nijinsky , Sergei Diaghilev had , it was reported , found another brilliant young male dancer in Leonide Massine , who would now star in the new , specially commissioned ballet entitled La Legende de Joseph , which no less a person than Richard Strauss had composed . Moreover , on the opera nights , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le Rossignolbut also Rimski-Korsakov 's Nuit de Mai , the same composer'sIvan le Terrible , and , most important of all , Moussorgsky'sBoris Godunov , in the title role of which Feodor Chaliapin , as yet unknown outside of Russia , would produce  --  it was said  --  a great sensation . Both the ballet and the opera would combine their forces for the unique presentation of Rimski 's Coq d'Orandmost important of all , Stravinsky 's Le Sacre de Printemps would appear in London at last . The season of four or five weeks would unquestionably eclipse anything so far given in England . All London was agog for the event . I attended these performances at least a dozen times , having spent so lavishly on tickets for myself and for Daisy that three times every week at least , during the whole month of July , we were found together in our seats , usually in the first balcony . The season still remains in my own memory , and perhaps in that of some other people , as a culmination of all the possibilities of the modern theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music , and great stagecraft welded together into complete harmony . Where in Covent Garden , near by , the scenerywas tawdry , the costumes cheap , the pieces given were heavy , indigestible Wagner , Verdi 's melodic rant , or Puccini 's and Gounod'scheap sentimentalities , here everything glittered with the fierce sensuousness , the naive barbaric rhythm of semi-Asiatic Russia . Above all , Chaliapin proved the supreme sensation , eclipsing even the ballet  --  Chaliapin and the perfectly drilled , vividly unifiedRussian chorus . When the curtain went down on the great coronation scene of Boris Godunov the audience literally yelled themselves hoarse . And no wonder . None who ever saw this singer in his prime , in this particular part , can have ever forgotten him . Despite the number of times he must have made up for it , each time that he gave it , he somehow conveyed the impression that he was reliving the mind-tortured czar 's existence for the first time . And to do this , on the stage , is genius . On the part of the ballet , the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rimski-Korsakov 's fairy tale opera , Coq d'Or . This was sung by two groups of singers arranged in ranks on both sides of the stage , and dressed uniformly in stiff scarlet garments , like the figures in a Byzantine fresco , while the action of the piece was mimed in the center of the stage by the ballet troupe itself . This entirely successful combination was set off by Goncharova 's amazingly barbaric stage settings , a great sunburst of the most vivid primary colors . The dancing of the lovely Karsavina , who had too long been thought of in the public mind as a mere foil to Nijinsky , was never more suave and seductive than in the part of the Queen of Shemakan ; and Adolph Bolm , chief male dancer , revealed unsuspected gifts as a grotesque comedian in the part of the absurd King Dodon . Rimski-Korsakov 's music , with its caressingly suave melodic flow , like that of a Russian Mozart , and its wide range of atmospheric effects , from the dreamy and sensuous oriental languor of the scene of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhythm of the return to the city at the opening of the last act , seemed an absolute and unquestioned masterpiece . I had read that this particular opera was the composer 's swan song , and that he had died disappointed , because the **25;4650;TOOLONG Russian censorship , suspecting in its fairy tale atmosphere some concealed element of political satire , had sup pressed it . How his ghost would have rejoiced , I thought , if it could have visited London and been present at this amazing and triumphant production ! In view of such a work , Stravinsky 's new opera of Le Rossignolseemed labored , forced , and cold , lacking in freshness and in life . And even Le Sacre de Printemps now failed to move me for the second time as it had the first . It seemed unnecessarily stiff and ungainly , both in its command of musical resources and in its dancing . It was received with none of the frenzied protest or the equally frenzied acclamation that had greeted its first appearance , over a year ago , in Paris . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arouse a sensation , that its primitivism was too intellectually forced . Rimski-Korsakov'spower of melodic utterance , on the other hand , had been exactly matched by his musical skill . His creative instinct had been neatly balanced by his intellectual capacity , and the fairy tale atmosphere of his opera emerged as much from his musical knowledge as from his own sunnily imaginative temperament . In contrast with Coq d'Or , Stravinsky 's music in Rossignol sounded merely bookish , a derivative from Schoenberg 's , as Pound 's poetry had been from the French satirists . I suspected him of being a pedant , as indeed he has later largely turned out to be . But if Stravinsky 's music seemed bookish and pedantic , what was I to say of Richard Strauss , and his new ballet , La Legende de Joseph ? Here were trotted out again , to grace a stage setting and ballet done in the elaborate style of rococo Venice , all the solemn pseudo profundities and the heavy sentimentalities that I had grown long since to despise in Wagner . The work had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the work of the great Russians . It was given in an atmosphere already ringing with those ultimatums between Austria and Serbia which led , two weeks later , to the outbreak of the greatest and most fatally destructive war in history , since the downfall of imperial Rome . Probably not one in a thousand of the packed audience who saw it and greeted it with their applause , from the lovely Lady Diana Manners in her box to the humblest looker-on at the backp155of the top gallery , ! rallied that its art had anything to do with the existing European situation . But for my part I was disgusted that Strauss should have seen fit to tack his music , so lacking in Dionysiac elan , to the vivid ( lancing of the ballet . At the end of the performance , when all the rest of the London audience were applauding , I hissed loudly , whereupon my hisses were taken up by one or two who stood near me . Others turned around , and frankly stared in amazement , as I stood at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Daisy , who stood at my side , was embarrassed . Three weeks later , half the European countries were echoing with those hisses ; but I knew nothing of this at the time . By spending as much money as I could afford on tickets for this brilliant season of Russian opera and ballet , for both Daisy and myself , I strove to forget the situation in which I now found myself . The woman who was my wife in everything but name was about to depart to the country , as if still attached to her husband ; and I was arranging to go to Switzerland immediately , upon the conclusion of this season . What Daisy herself made of this introduction to a world of elaborate and sophisticated art , which I had contrived to give her , I do not know . She had come late in life  --  later , indeed , than I suspected  --  through her own and my flouting of convention , to a point where , like me , she was living a double life . Circumstances , inevitable in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to continue in this way . I can not help drawing the contrast with the situation I then had been drawn into with my situation now . I have now achieved a life perfect in its understanding , its comradeship , and its reciprocal mingling of tenderness and passion , so that nothing stands external to it . May that life continue , and not only serve as contrast to the past , but illuminate the future ! July lengthened out to August . The Russian ballet and opera announced its final performances . All London prepared for its annual exodus to moor and seashore . As the curtain fell for the last time on the excited Drury Lane audience , I already had my bags packed , ready to take train the following day to Paris . The chancelleries of Europe , like frantic and purblind gamesters , were now staking note against note , and matching ultimatum with ultimatum ; but neither I nor any of the thou/sands who stood beside me realized that when that curtain next would rise , long years would have passed , millions would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a complete change iu human circumstances have come about , that mankind in general no longer seemed to stand on the same earth.  | ON Sunday morning , July 26th , 1914 , I left Victoria Station , bound for Paris . Although , in common with everyone else , I had read in the London newspapers the daily accounts of increasing tension betweenAustria and Serbia , ' nothing was further from my mind than the thought of an immediate war between all the countries of Europe . The game of bluff and counter-bluff diplomacy had been played for so long between all the chancelleries , the economicrivalry between Germany and England had so often been publicized by the semisensational press  --  without anyone in the least being disturbed by it , except a few die-hard old Tories  --  that no one now heeded the new danger signals which had been publicly hoisted ever since the assassination of the Austrian archduke . True , there was great tension in the Balkans . But there had been tension in the Balkans every summer for as long as anyone remembered . There had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no western European nation had been drawn into it . Serbia was a long way off from France or Germany or England . The whole thing was Austria 's own affair . That Russia would intervene , that Germany would back up Austria 's impossibledemands , that the German armies would be sent across Belgium to strike at France , occurred to no one . The British public was apathetic ; it thought far less of the European situationthan of the prospect of an imminent revolt in Ulster , over the old subject of Irish Home Rule . It was not till I arrived in Paris , after a smooth and uneventfulChannel crossing , that I observed anything unusual . The Gare du Nord , settling down to a hot and thundery night , was somnolent and deserted . Not so the Gare de Lyon . As the taxi which I had taken to cross Paris deposited me on the steps of the station , I noticed several companies of French infantry , wearing the familiar wide-skirted blue coats and the red baggy trousers which later on marked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curious crowd of onlookers , workmen ,  |p158women  , and children , no doubt drawn in from the neat by streets , stood gaping as they filed past in the strong light of t he arc lamps that beat down upon the platform . The porter who carried my two heavy suitcases in his strap was unable to cross the platform and reach my waiting train , because of the marching ranks of the soldiers . He put down his load . " What are those soldiers here for ? " I asked . I had never before , in Paris , seen anything like this . " They are going off to the summer maneuvers , " he said , and shrugged his shoulders . I decided to buy a paper from the near-by kiosk , while we waited for the troops to pass . The news was far less reassuring than I had been led to suppose by the London papers . There was nothing here about the suffragette outrages , or the Ulster troubles . Instead , the European crisis was blazoned across all the main pages . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or ten minutes , the porter by my side lifted my cases again to his shoulder , and we moved forward to my train . The inspector who examined my ticket at the iron grille which led to the train was smiling and deferentially polite , as befitted a Frenchman . " Ca fait chaud , ce soir , " he remarked , mopping himself as he looked at my ticket . " Pour la Suisse ? Tres bien ! Beaucoup de neige et des montagnes . Magnifique ! Maintenant , it arrive un orage . " I wanted to ask him about the troops , but I somehow thought it foolish to do so , in the face of so much good humor . He was right about the thunderstorm . I could hear it distinctly rumbling away in the distance , as I entered my train compartment . Having arranged my bags to my satisfaction and obtained a pillow from the attendant , I sat down and again unfolded the paper . I had still over half an hour before departure , and I read the news this time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Russia might forbid Austria to proceed against Serbia was unfounded . Had not the czar himself recently gone on a pleasure cruise in the Baltic aboard the yacht of no less a person than Kaiser Wilhelm , Emperor of Germany ? And it was quite true that the French army did hold field maneuvers every summer . The sudden spasm of dread that had gripped me as I stood on the platform and watched the troops file past , a few minutes ago , had been nothing but blind unreasoning panic . I could completep159any journey without further worry . I put the paper down , took off my coat , adjusted the pillow to the back of my seat , shaded the lamp overhead so it would not shine in my eyes , and went to sleep to the tune of the train starting and the thunder advancingfrom the south to meet it . The next afternoon , at about three or four o'clock , I disembarkedat my destination , Coire , a sleepy medieval-looking Swiss village in the valley of the Upper Rhine . Feeling fatigued from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not start my walk till the morrow , I took a room in a hotel and went to bed very early , so as to be thoroughly rested before my start . I do not think I even looked at a newspaper , for I was too weary , and Coire was extremely warm . The next three days were spent in nothing more important than walking , with a knapsack fastened to my shoulders , up the Upper Rhine valley , and across the Oberalp Pass . I had shipped my two suitcases on to Domodossola , where I expected to rejoin them in about a week . The weather was excellent , my shoes fitted me perfectly , and the walking was good . The scenery of the Upper Rhine region was fully up to my expectations , and the inns I stopped at on the way were adequate . I had enjoyed myself in the revivifying Alpine air , which is calculated to banish the fatigue even of the most indifferent pedestrian . I was sunburnt , tired , and happy . On Thursday evening , July @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , lying at the foot of the St. GotthardPass , which I had planned to cross next . At Andermatt , where I had stopped on the way , I had seen a newspaper , my first for three or possibly four days . The news had taken away my appetite . Austria 's ultimatum to Serbia expired tomorrow , Friday , midnight . What did that mean ? Russia had mobilized her army on her frontier . What did that mean ? Kaiser Wilhelm had begged the czar to stop the Russian mobilization before it was too late , but the czar had gone on . What did that mean ? France was also mobilizing , and would back Russia . Nothing but rumors of war ! Would this crisis pass , as so many others had passed ? Or would it end by engulfing the whole of Europe ? I could not answer that question . My baggage lay at Domodossola , far away across the Italian frontier . I had nothing with me but a knap/o sack , some American Express traveler 's checks , and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out-of-date American passport , issued in 1908 , the year I had come for the first time to Europe . I had lived in Europe too long to think of myself any longer as an American . I thought of myself , rather , as a " good European . " But were there any good Europeans ? Did Europe , except as a convenient fiction for writers of history books , really exist ? Or were there only various European countries , all more or less opposed , even in times of peace , and now getting ready to grab at each other 's throats ? Even peaceful Switzerland , buried in the very heart of Europe , lying athwart the great mountain barrier that had barred North from South , Latin from Celt and Teuton , since time immemorial , spoke three languages . If a European war should come , Switzerland too might be drawn in , and fall apart . The landlord of the most picturesque inn at Hospenthal , Die Drei Krone , was unable even to offer me a room , so I judged there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near by to a less pretentious Gasthof , and having there washed off the dust of my day 's walking , changed my shoes and my shirt , I returned to the Drei Krone , and was given supper in a picturesquely medieval dining room with carved wooden paneling along the walls . It was now utterly dark , and the room was half deserted ; it was empty before I had finished . I had already drunk my coffee , had paid the waiter , and was sitting smoking a pipe on the terrace outside , feeling drowsy after a long day 's walk in the open , when I thought I heard a bell ringing and looked up . A priest was descending the narrow street that led on to the church , at the upper end of the village . He was flanked by two acolytes , each bearing candles . One of them was ringing , as he walked , the small hand bell whose tinklings I had heard . The priest carried in his hands something under a silken cloth , presumablythe Sacrament . He descended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , went past the terrace where I was sitting , and kept on into the maze of narrow alleys that constitutedthe lower town . A small group of villagers , men and women , the men with their hats off , followed . I hurriedly pulled out my pocketbook , put a small tip on the table , and started out after the procession . I caught up with them a few doors lower down , just before they turned up a nar- 1 6 row , steep , and unlit alleyway to the left . Ilere was a housewith light so-canting from its open doorway and from two lighted open windows upstairs . The priest went in , and some of the villagersfollowed . Others began to kneel on the stones of the street , and , pulling out rosaries from their pockets , proceeded to tell their beads . After a moment or so , I thought I could detectthe sound of chanting coming from the open lighted windowson the third floor upstairs . There is something so simple , so dignified , and yet so completelyuniversal about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbelievers . Whatever we may say about the dogma of this Church , in her ceremonial and ritual she is equal to any occasion . Here , obviously , the last sacrament was being administered to some simple Swiss villager who lay dying , to comfort and console his spirit in its last moments . And the small group of some nine or ten people who now knelt on the pavement of the cobblestoned alley in the Rembrandt-etched light from the doorway were trying , in their simple , unsophisticatedway , to waft this soul safely to heaven , while the last rites of earth were being administered to it upstairs by the priest . I too , though a heretic Protestant , and a skeptic at heart , longed to join them . I too felt that I would like to kneel and pray , not so much that this simple inhabitant of Hospenthal might survive , as that all Europe itself might not perish that evening . I had taken off my hat when I first saw the procession , out of respect for beliefs I neither inherited nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did not join the small group by the doorway , and kneel with them . Were there others that night who prayed as I did , standing upright , that the heritage of Europeanculture which Christianity  --  and the Catholic Church foremost  --  hadsaved and re-created from the wreckage of the pagan past , might not perish , and that mankind might be spared the horrors of universal warfare ? I do not know , but I suppose there must have been thousands who echoed my prayer . Yet heaven was deaf , and returned another answer to all of us . After standing for a few minutes , I turned , and went back to the hotel ; and after asking the night porter to be sure to rouse me by five-thirty on the following morning , went to my room , where I slept a dreamless sleep . The next morning , a few minutes after six o'clock alreadyp162found me on the St. Gotthard road , bound for Ail ( ) ID. there , I knew I could get to Domodossola by train , and I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Airolo some time before , having walked harder and covered more mileage than on any of my previous days . ' I he people in the hotel were reassuring . War was unthinkable for them ; neither Switzerland nor Italy would ever , under any circumstances , be drawn in . I was safe where I was . So I sat on the terrace of the hotel and watched the swallows circling in the rosy Alpine glow of the great peaks to the north , and thought that I had never seen a more beautiful evening . Tomorrow , the first of August , I could go down to Milan by train , and take another train back to Domodossola . I might , however , have to spend the night in Milan , where the weather was likely to be extremely warm , or else arrive so late at Domodossola as to find the baggageroom at the station closed for the night . By careful study of maps and routes in my guidebook , I discovered there was yet another alternative . I could walk from Airolo up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tosa Falls , a cataract that was listed in the guidebook as being interesting . And from there I could descend directly into the valley that led to Domodossola . The only difficulty with this plan lay in the fact that I could not possibly walk the entire distance in a single day . My forced march to Airolo had wearied me , and the way up to Tosa valley promised a steep climb . About the only stopping place en route lay at the Tosa Falls itself , where there was a second-class Italian inn  --  but this was no more than one-third the way . I should have to rely in any case on my feet , as there was no train or conveyance of any sort up this unfrequented valley . Should I make the attempt , and indulge in two days more of my vacation ? Alone in my hotel room , I decided to risk it . After all , I had come abroad to walk ; and I had not yet walked for a full week . My muscles were getting into shape now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people at Airolo had accepted my AmericanExpress check without a murmur . Two days more of fairly easy walking would bring me to the Italian end of the Simplon Tunnel . If war was coming , after all , it would not disorganize the Paris-Simplon-Milan express service , the most famous train in Europe , in the short space of two days . So I reasoned , knowing 3nothing whatever of modern wars , nor of the fate that overshadowedme , along with the rest of humanity . The next morning I was again early afoot . I had gone about a mile or so along the road that led to where the mule track for the Tosa valley diverged , when I noticed a good-looking young man sitting by the roadside , his knapsack beside him , holding a bloody handkerchief up to his nose . As I knew something of the ways of nosebleed in the Alps , having occasionally suffered from the same complaint myself , I stopped to speak to him , and advise him to lie flat on his back , with a handkerchief dipped in the adjoining @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished the hemorrhage to stop . I spoke to him first in Italian , then in French . He only shook his head . Finally I tried German . He instantly replied , and was grateful to me for my advice . The cold handkerchief soon stopped the flow of blood . It had only come on , he explained , because he had descended too rapidly from one of the near-by peaks that morning . He had been climbing about for the past week . " Where are you going ? " I asked him , half hoping for a companionon my walk . " I am going into Airolo , to catch the St. Gotthard Express this morning . I must get back to Germany . " " Why are you cutting short your holiday ? " I asked . He seemed so frank , so friendly , so easy to talk to , as he sat there . " I must rejoin my regiment , " he replied . It was exactly as if a dark shadow had fallen across the face of the sun . I suppose I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then war is certain ? " I asked . " I am afraid so , " he replied , fatalistically , getting up and puttingon his knapsack . " Thanks very much for helping me . Are you English or American ? " " English , " I replied , scarcely thinking of what I said , and immediately after I had spoken , wondering whether the country to which I now made claim of allegiance would really be dragged into this senseless war , as her own jingoistic press had predicted long before . Fervently I hoped not , as I rose and gripped his hand . " Well , good-by and good luck , " I said . " Or rather , auf Wiedersehen . We may meet somewhere again . " " Auf Wiedersehen , " he said , and smiled for the first time since my eyes had rested on his face . We tinned our separate ways . As I went along , up a road that soon diverged into a track that led sharply upward , paved with large flat stones that had lain undisturbed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lied to him , and called myself an Englishman . I had never supposed , before this , that England meant anything more to me than a refuge from the blatancies and the commercial crudities of my own country . Yet I felt now that England meant more . It had , after all , taught me more than America of life and of poetry . Even if the unthinkable could happen , even if a war should spring up between the country where I had lived for close on to five years , and Germany  --  a war incredibly fantastic in my eyes , since this fine-looking athletic young man and I were at bottom blood relations  --  I still owed an unconscious homage to England . I arrived at the hotel which lay at the summit , close by the Tosa Falls , at about three in the afternoon . The way up the old mule track had been steep and sultry , and I was weary , having had nothing to eat since breakfast but a cake of chocolate , washed down by water from a wayside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to stop , but to go on . In two hours I could descend to a highway where I could catch a bus which would bring me into Domodossola that night . All of his guests had departed a day or so before , and he expected to close the hotel soon and return to Milan . Nevertheless , I knew I was too weary to go on . All duringthat day , and throughout that lonely walk up the valley  --  for except for the young German and a peasant or two , I had not met another soul  --  what the young German had said to me that morning remained fixed in my mind , and blent with the lush green of the Alpine meadows , the dark woods of spruce , the sunburnt rock , and the sparkling snow of the distant peaks . Was I , after all , English or German or American ? My mother , I knew , had been German . My father had come from pure Scotch and English stock . I had been born in America , but had adopted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linked my fate to that of an Englishwoman ; a post card from her announcing her arrival in Cornwall lay now in my pocket . Where did myp165country exist ? What was my country ? I could not answer these questions . Fagged out , I took a room in the hotel , went into it , took off my clothes , and slept for over two hours . When I wakened , the sun was already going down . I had just time enough to walk over to the waterfall , the roar of which could be heard from the hotel itself , to look at it , and to stroll into the empty whitewashedchurch , barren of interest except for a carved , gilt GermanGothic altarpiece . Then I returned to the hotel , for a simple but satisfying meal . The last bus had gone for Domodossolalong ago . I was the sole tourist left . What the morrow would bring forth , I did not know . Before I went to bed I ascertained from the proprietor that if I arose at six I could catch a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The next one would not come along till between one and two in the afternoon . I could only reach the road along which the bus ran by walking for at least two hours . Newspapers and mails and supplies would come up to the hotel by mule transport about eight-thirty in the morning . I fully determined to catch the early bus , but circumstances willed otherwise . About one or two in the morning I was awakenedby the roar of the waterfall , so much louder in the nocturnal silence than it had been by day . Had the armies already started their movements across the map of Europe ? I lay awake , tossinguneasily , till dawn showed in the sky . Then I slept , not to waken till past eight o'clock . Breakfast over , I waited for the muleteer to bring up the mail and newspapers . There was nothing to do but wait . The newspaper , when it came , proved to be the Corriere della Sera of the afternoon before , fresh from its presses in Milan . There could be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with France and Russia . It was reported that German troops had already crossed the Belgian frontier . In England , Parliament had been summoned to meet on Monday . No one knew what Italy would do , but it was hoped she would remain neutral . A little after ten o'clock , being unable to stand my isolation any longer , I left the hotel and descended in the two hours I had allotted to myself into the valley leading on to Domodossola . There I walked for another hour , in increasing heat and sultriness , along a shadeless and dusty road , with traffic flowing con/tinually past me , bound iii the direction of Italy . Finally I took refuge in an inn , by the wayside , ate a hurried luch , and awaited the bus . It duly came , crowded with shirt-sleeved and chattering Italians . At about four o'clock , after a dusty and sweltering ride , I alighted at last at the railroad station which lay at the mouth of the Simplon Tunnel . I obtained my bags , summoned a taxicab , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The lobby was packed with tourists , English , American , German , drifting hither and thither , some with their baggage , some not , all of them unwilling refugees from the War . The babel of their voices was terrific , and the staff of the hotel was being swamped with their demands . I stood irresolute among them , merely another waif of the War , not knowing what to do next . Finally I managed to draw the hall porter , a fine-looking mustached Italian , aside for a moment . He spoke perfect English . Briefly I detailed to him the situation . I wanted to get back to London , via Paris . " There are no trains going through to Paris , " he said , as if repeating the news for the thousandth time . " You might get as far as Geneva tonight , but after that you wo n't go further . The best thing for you to do is to stay here . Here you are safe . " " Safe ? How ? " " Italy has just officially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty minutes ago . But she is closing her frontiers at midnight , and will not reopen them again for three days , as a measure of precaution . If you desire to stay here , you will not be able to move till the sixth . " " Have you any rooms ? " " There is not a room available in the hotel , and we have been trying for hours to get cots from the hospital , to take care of this crowd . You might find things less crowded at Geneva . The frontier closes at seven , and the last train goes at six-thirty . " He glanced at the clock that hung over the cashier 's desk . Its hands pointed to four-thirty . " Could I find a room here just to wash up and change my clothes in ? " " Certainly . " And he led me to his own little cubicle , where I spent the next thirty minutes.  |p167When  I emerged I had removed my walking togs and sweaty shirt , and was dressed in my usual civilian costume , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ washed and brushed , had put on light shoes in the place of my heavy walking boots , and no longer bore traces of the grime and sweat of the morning . The crowd was still jabbering and drifting , or sitting helplessly , everywhereabout the lobby . The hall porter smiled at me , accepted a generous tip , and summoned a taxicab . The station clerk readily sold me a ticket as far as Geneva . The train was due in about an hour . I went out on the train platform , and there received another shock . The platform was heaped high with boxes , bags , bundles of bedding . These were the belongings of the Swiss workmen , engaged in the completion of the Simplon Tunnel . They had been ordered out of Italy and were leaving by the final train . I drifted into the buffet and ate mechanically . At about a quarter to seven , fifteen minutes from the time set for its arrival , the train came in . It was packed and I got aboard , but finding no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ overcrowded corridors , and prepared to stand . The train was jammed with English and Americans , all of whom seemed to regard the War , and everything connected with it , as a huge joke . Gales of laughter swept the corridor as one tourist group after another told of their broken holidays , their last-minute escapes , their misadventures with their baggage . We were like a group of irresponsible school children , playing truant for the day and having nowhere in particular to go . At about nine o'clock the train reached Lausanne , and I , who had been standing for over two hours , finally dropped off . We were now safely within the frontier of Switzerland , and I could complete my trip on the morrow . A near-by hotel offered me a room , and I gratefully accepted . I turned in and slept . The next morning , Monday , August 3 , I went to the AmericanExpress office and to Thomas Cook 's on the way . Both offices were besieged by stranded tourists . Cook 's could sell no tickets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Paris . The American Express refused to cash a traveler 's check , except in the case of an emergency , if called upon to do so by the American consulate . I still had my unused ticket to Geneva , and some funds . I might therefore have gone into the garden of Gibbon 's villa , and meditated with that immortal ghost on the downfall of empires , but I did not . Instead , I took a train to Geneva that afternoon . The next day , August 4 , the only news in Geneva was that England had entered the War . So the inevitable had arrived at last ! The American consulate , after viewing my out-of-date passport , stated that the best thing I could do would be to return to the United States via Italy and the Mediterranean . I pointed out to them that all my belongings were in London , and that I had lived there continuously for the past four or more years . Finally , after long and aggravating delays , they yielded . I was granted a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which would take me to England  --  if I could find a train . It was not until Monday , August 10 , that the train to Paris was put on . It consisted almost entirely of old-fashioned , worn-out , third-class carriages , and those who wished to travel by it had to be in their places early , as a long line of applicants for seats stretched down the Geneva platform . There were no porters , and everyone had to carry his own baggage . I staggeredunder the weight of mine  --  two heavy suitcases and my knapsack . At seven-thirty the train was packed up to the doors , and we waited another half-hour till the engine driver decided to pull out his throttle . Finally we departed . I have only the haziest recollections of the journey . The train took us , at a rate of not more than thirty miles an hour , by a route which penetrated far into the South of France . Where we went , I have no idea ; but I suspect we diverged far into the lower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the most unimportant places , and French peasants kept driftingin and out , mostly eyeing me and my German-made knapsackwith suspicion . The fifteen or twenty English-speaking touristsaboard who had finally risked the journey were scattered about , here and there , amid a horde of Midi villagers , climbing in and getting out , eating their lunches on the seats  --  but offeringme none  --  and jabbering Provencal dialect . Most of the English , no doubt , as I , soon regretted their haste in getting away ; probably , a few days later , better trains were to be had . We traveled all day and night , and on Tuesday afternoon , August i i , arrived finally in Paris . For the last two or threep169hours we kept passing long strings of French freight cars , going up to the front , with the legs and arms of French poilus dangling from their doorways , cheering and laughing , and with the words " a Berlin " exultantly chalked on their sides . I had been so anxious to depart from Geneva that I had neglected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . During the whole of the two-day trip we had stopped some four or five times at stations which boasted of buffets . But here nothing whatever was to be had except bread , cheese , sour red wine , and coffee , at prices which were utterly fantastic . My breakfast on the morning of the eleventh had consisted of a roll without butterand a cup of coffee . I had not lunched when we arrived at Paris . Nevertheless I contrived to drag my baggage  --  there were still no porters  --  along the length of the platform and into a taxi , which bore me to my usual hotel . At the hotel the proprietress and her daughter , the same I had seen in 1911 , in 1912 , and in 1913 , were dressed in black crepe , with heavy black-bordered handkerchiefs in their hands , and looked pale and tearful . I did not question them about their loss . They informed me that I could not stop for the night without a permit from a near-by police station . They hoped only that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retake Alsace ; whence , it appeared , they had originally come to Paris . I reassured them , curtly , that I saw no reason why the French could not retake Alsace , and went out in search of the police station . The police officer was disposed to be inquisitive . He wanted to know whether I could speak German . Truly this was a different world I had fallen into , in the short space of two weeks ! I cut him short and , armed with a permit for twelve hours , went back to the hotel , changed my clothes , and obtained a square meal at last . The next morning I quitted Paris , without seeing any of my old friends there . Where was Cannel , Holley , or Fergusson ? I did not know . The train was packed with English , as was the boat , a rickety old Channel steamer , which , thanks to fine weather , made the voyage between Boulogne and Folkestone uneventfullyin about two hours . The port of Calais was already closed . As we approached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose . I had already seen enough of Paris , withp170its shops closed and mobilization notices posted across the iron shutters , to realize that I was flying from a dead city , a city alreadystricken by the economic paralysis , the hectic rumors and alarms , the emotional hysterias of the War . Shops with German-soundingnames had already been attacked , looted , and burned by the mob . Jaures had been assassinated , and the Socialistshad gone into hiding or into uniform . The newspapers were already full of German atrocity stories and the legends of the heroic defense of Liege . Colmar had fallen  --  a great victory . England was coming . The only thought was of the advancingshadow of the German armies , extended across Europe . On Boulogne pier a solitary British sentry in a new khaki uniform , his rifle to his shoulder , was pacing up and down . Beyond , three or four lean British torpedo-boat destroyers were patrolling the Channel . Aboard the steamer I breathed more easily , and soon settled down to a state of quiescence . The long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had come again to the inviolate peace , the sure refuge of seagirt England.  | LONDON , unlike Paris , looked almost entirely unchanged duringthe first weeks of the War . About the only signs of England'sactive participation were numerous recruiting posters at various points , and signs above several shops , announcing " Businessas Usual . " The streets and hotels were still filled with Americantourists , many of them unwilling refugees from the Continent , now unable to find a ship to take them home . Had I but known it , Miss Lowell was herself in this class . She was still in London , waiting for an opportunity to depart . I only stayed in London for two days , and did not inquire about her . On the fifteenth of August I left for Cornwall , where were Daisy , her husband , and the children . By chance I managed to find a room in the Cornish fishingvillage where they were stopping , near enough to their boardinghouseto enable me to take my meals with them , and there I spent the last week of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was , for a time , not under the same roof with the woman whose life had become so entangled with mine . I was aware that her husband had only come in order to make it appear to the boardinghouseproprietor that he and his wife were still a married couple . They did not share rooms ; she slept with her daughter , and he shared a room with his son . Their relations were merely that of two strangers , outwardly polite , inwardly aloof , sustained by a hypocritical conformity to a legal fiction . But in any case , they did not and could not help me to a solution of my personal problem . For this I needed to be alone now , and to think . The problem was , how long would this war go on ? If it were long sustained I knew well that I could not remain in England . I had obtained a permit to stay for only three months , which would bring me up to the middle of November . After that , what ? What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the struggle with the magnificent machine which Germany had unloosed ? Kitchener was already enrolling his recruits " for three years or duration of the war . " But in the ex- citement. of unexampled feelings , none knew how Car Kitchelmneed be taken seriously . Everyone was still taking holiday : Londonhad been full of pleasure seekers , secure in the invincible might of England . And in the Cornish boardinghouse , all , from Daisy 's husband down to the humblest bootblack , argued that England would win easily in a few months . They all expected that the small Expeditionary Force which the War Office was now dispatchingoverseas would eat their Christmas dinners in the Kaiser 's palace at Potsdam . Day by day brought no news except of the irresistible advanceof the German armies . England was safe from invasion , thanks to the Channel seas , and her own navy . But what about France ? The German armies swept aside the feeble Belgian resistanceas a strong man might break a stick in his two hands . Now they were already on the French frontier  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War Office issued a reassuring dispatch . The German advance was halted . Yet the next day , the British had retired ten , fifteen , twenty miles farther back . It was easy by looking at the map to see which side was advancing and which retreating . But everyone had , by now , heard that Russian troops had been seen passing through London . They had come all the way from St. Petersburg and the Baltic to fight on the soil of France . This was the carefully guarded surprise that Kitchener and the War Office had prepared for the Germans . Even in England they had traveled in trains with blinds drawn , so that news of their coming would not leak out . Yet everyone knew about it : some had even seen them . Day on day passed , and the German advance went on and on . Would anything halt it , short of Paris ? That was the sole question facing the world at the hour . On the ninth of September , with the whole course of the War still hanging in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month of the three I would be permitted to stay had already gone by . I had no light whatsoever on the situation . Daisy 's husband had returned to his work as a photographer , being over age for the army , and was doing well photographing officers who wanted pictures of themselves in fine uniforms to send to their girls . Everybody was writing patriotic poems , and two or three anthologies of them were being hurried through the press . Thep173newspapers were lauding Belgium to the skies . King Albert was already a demigod . London was more full of recruiting posters than ever ; everyone was now doing " his or her bit . " The women were getting into uniform . The theaters had ceased to be taken seriously ; Charlie Chaplin films and undressed revues were all that anyone cared to see . The new song , " Tipperary , " was everywhere . While it was being played the whole audience stood up . There was not the least danger of invasion ; but  --  a new and ominous note  --  in view of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ save gas and electricity , the streets were going to be darkened by official order . The Marne came and went , but the German armies still stood on French soil , with the Allies unable to deliver a strong counterstroke . The autumn rains came , the equinoctial gales raged up and down the Channel , the leaves littered the Londonparks and the streets of my suburb . I had only a month left . It was at this time last year that my resistance had been broken , and that Daisy and I had first come together . Then I still felt young and hopeful about the future . Now I already felt tired , discouraged , and old . To stay was horrible ; to return to America was a desperate expedient , and would throw me back into my old loneliness . What should I do ? A new note was now creeping into my poetry . Try as I would , it was impossible to get away from the pervasive influenceof the War . Kitchener 's recruits were everywhere . Some were billeted even in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led to the nearest railway station . Marching columns were continually passing here and there through London . They soon became so familiar as to rouse , on the part of spectators , not the faintest sign of interest . Along with the ascendancy of Mars , Venus , too , began to rule the world . The arrests and hunger strikes of the suffragettes , which had made so much history in the London press only the preceding spring , were already an ancient tale . The women were now busy at a different and more obviously biological task ; the capture of a male , preferably one in uniform . Young girls of good families were already pinning white feathers to the lapels of their boy friends who were hesitantto join the army . Every evening I witnessed from my subur/ban home servant girls stealing forth to the embraces of stray soldiers . And the parade of harlots up and down shadowy Piccadillyat night redoubled . I felt a new mood of revolt against my own ridiculous situation , and against the ridiculous situation of the world , rising @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what had happened ? Not Germany , nor Russia , nor France , nor England , but only the baseness of human nature . I began writing feverishly on a new poem , which I called with unconscious irony , " Middle-Age . " As a matter of fact , my age was exactly twenty-eight years and nine months . But I probably would be killed in the War anyway ( enormous casualty lists were already appearing in the papers ) , and besides , I felt middle-aged . So I began : Sombre revoltSmoulders in my heart , Breezes crackle in the trees , dry artillery , Burnt leaves are flung , shell fragments , On the hoar withered grass . The sky is one steel spiderweb Of cruel rays . Dry laughter of a vagrant bird Quivers and trills among them Deviously . This free verse opening contrasted with the meter of the second section ( for this poem , too , was a " symphony , " a symphonyof a new sort ) : It is harvest in our village , Now we troop out to the fields @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fruit that the earth yields . Once we harvested gladly ; Now unwillingly we come , For the violins of life resound no longer , The tambourines of youth are hushed and dumb . And there are dark brows over cornstalks , Dull scytheblades that do not shine ; Blight and rust on the harvest , Bitter lees in the wine.  |p175The  whole poem concluded with violent stanzas , expressing the sense of the entire futility of all revolt , and yet the more desperate sense that my own revolt must go on . I laid the poem aside , judging it to be self-pitying and entirely immature . It was not published for twenty-one years , when the hour of middle age had long since truly sounded in my life . Then I let it appear , unchanged , except for title . As an example of the symphonic treatment of themes drawn from real life  --  the " symphonies " themselveswere not devised to touch on real life except accidentally  --  this is one of the earliest , in point of time , of my poems . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war poems , but they were different from the poems of Rupert Brooke and of others who were now vocally thanking God for the War : Under the soft grey windswept sky , Between two rows of yellow trees Soddenly dripping ; The brown backs of an army Go marching . Like an enormous snake with undulatory movement , Past the old church with scarlet creeper hooding its stiff grey walls , Past the drowsy churchyardWhere wet leaves cling to the stones ; Up the hill and past the village , Through the curving lines of hedgerows , Beyond the brow of the hill , lost in brown stubble , The brown backs of an armyGo writhing in the distance . Under the flying clouds that hide the eastern sky , Footfalls , footfalls , repeated clamor of footfalls , One , two , left , right , the road is full of them ; And the noise rises and strives to clingTo the wet windblown branches , It penetrates the empty church and echoes up the aisles . Whirling leaves drift over the endless footfalls , Striving to hush them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prediction which , unconscious of its full import , I had written at the end of the " White Symphony , " was coming true at last :  |p1760  that the white scroll of heaven might be rolled up , And the naked red lightning thrust at the smouldering earth ! In a halfhearted fashion I still tried to keep up my literary contacts , hoping against hope that I would soon waken from this nightmare and find the War suddenly come to an end . Pound , however , was no longer available . Soon after my return to Londonfrom Cornwall I received a letter from Amy , informing me that she had been forced to stay in England till the twentieth of August , and that she was now already busily engaged in getting together material for the new imagist anthology . Pound was out for good and all . The whole thing would be called simply Some Imagist Poets . Aldington would do the introduction . She was going to include D. H. Lawrence , not because he was an imagist , but only to take the place of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the prospects of imagism in America , and wished I could come over and see things for myself . As she and I had already had some differences of opinion about the value of Paul Fort 's poetry , she wanted me to see a new poem she had recently written in this vein . And she included " The Bombardment . " The news about Pound came as no surprise . I had already realized that Ezra was adamant , and would never acknowledge anything to be imagism that he did not run and control personally . His new vorticist group were following up their first Blast with a war number which finally appeared the next year . In this they tried to continue the sensation of their first appearance . It was useless , I knew , to argue further with him , or with them . " The Bombardment , " however , did come as a surprise to me . Up to that summer I had resisted all Miss Lowell 's attempts to get me converted to her employment of the Paul Fort form , with its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her early works written in this form  --  " The Forsaken , " " The Basket , " " In a Castle . " But " The Bombardment " was somehow different . It seemed to me to possess a form immeasurablysuperior , more flexible , and dramatic than anything that Paul Fort had written . And it chimed in with my own mood . It drew the complete contrast between the beauty of serene art and the folly and desolation of destruction the armies had unleashed on the world . I had long since been envious of Amy'sp177ability to write poems of dramatic contrast and narrative climax . ' " The Bombardment " did this in a new and unexpected way , owing nothing to the old , academic models . I was enthusiastic , and realized that I was being outstripped in the race by my competitor . Still doubtful as to what I ought to do in regard to the War situation , which was growing steadily worse , and wishing to find some literary contacts , I looked up Aldington . Flint was no longer available , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important public buildings in London , the Post Office . Aldingtonhad taken over the position vacated by Pound on the Egoist , and was busy with small funds largely obtained , I suspect , from Miss Lowell herself , in keeping the magazine together . He was no longer the gay , insouciant , jaunty , swaggering Aldington I had known . His new post kept him busy at the Egoist office every day . Pound and he no longer spoke to each other , and he was scornful of Ezra 's efforts to whip up interest in this topic of war . The business of the artist , now more than ever , he was convinced , was to conduct a crusade against all this false patriotism and to uphold the cause of beauty at all hazards . Everything in England was simply reeking with the contest . Everybody was writing patriotic poems . He wished that I , or someone else , would show up the whole thing . He was perfectly willing to join up with the army , had let his name be put down on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he was going to feel all steamed up with patriotism over the stupid Germans . The artist had something better to do . He really wished that somebody would let himself go , and make fun of the whole business . He wondered now why I did not go back to America . He wished he could go there , and he would have gone , but for the fact that he was inescapably an Englishman . Neither H. D. nor he had enough money to leave England . His new job of editing the Egoist would keep him busy till he could find something better . If the worst came to the worst , he would quit London , bury himself in the country , and wait till he was drafted . This new phase in Aldington only increased my bewilderment . I knew I must take up some attitude towards it . I was an American , with a literary career of little more than a year to my credit . I was living now in London , had lived in London practically continuously since 1910 . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were fighting in a righteous cause , the cause of small nations , against Germany . The London newspaperswere soon full of atrocity stories , as London itself was full of Belgian refugees , and everybody believed them . I did not know what to believe . President Wilson had already proclaimedAmerica to be neutral . Whether he was right or wrong , I could not say . I only knew that as a neutral I could not stay on in London , even if I could obtain an extension to my passport . I had no business of any outstanding importance to keep me there . My business was to write poetry  --  not patriotic poetry , or antiwar poetry , but poetry . Even in times of peace such a task had often appeared to me as the creation of a pure luxury product . In wartime it was frankly useless . On the other hand , all I could do to show my attachment to the cause of the Allies  --  whom , in common with everyone , including Miss Lowell herself , I favored  --  was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to help fight England 's battles ; in much the same spirit as my father , who was not an advocate of secession , had been among the first to enter the service of the Confederacy . I considered that , if I stayed , I should join the British army ; but when I mentioned this idea to Daisy , she had simply burst into tears . Why could I not remain where I was , and wait till the whole thing was over . The War would be finished by Christmas , at the outside ; England was bound to win in three or four months ; better men than I were already fighting for her , and thousands more were joining daily . There was no reason for me to think I could add anything to the force which England was proposing to employ . Besides , if I got myself killed , where would she and the children be ? They would be paupers , since she now had no claim on her husband that he need respect , and since my own income lapsed entirely at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even express a desire to go . Frankly , I thought her attitude unreasonable . She hated the Germans to such an extent that she declared that certain neighbors of ours , who happened to bear German names , should be interned ; yet she protested bitterly when I offered to go and help England fight her own battles . It was true that my annuity did lapse on my death , and if I were killed she would be left entirely un- 79provided for . That was not , however , my fault . I resolved that , come what might , I would not be swayed by her attitude . Aldington 's attitude seemed , on consideration , far more reasonable , and more worthy of respect . He recognized that the War existed , and that he must himself take up an attitude towardsit . Yet his attitude differed from that of the conscientious objectors  --  already they were being discussed  --  who , brave and sinceremen as they were , simply refused to have anything to do with the War at all . His attitude was that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a figure as that of Leonardo da Vinci , who had entered Cesare Borgia 's service , striven to serve his patron as lie best might , and then when all the Borgia schemes collapsed , wrote calmly in his journal , " The Duke has lost all his lands , and all his projects have come to nothing , " and returned to his work in Milan . He recognized that his task lay not in serving the blood lust of mankind , but in helping them towards a finer perception of beauty . Beauty , to his mind , was a thing of a higher order than the mere sentimental gush over one 's own country . It was universal , and the business of the artist was to find it and to serve it . It seemed to me that his attitude was dignified , and worthy of my regard . Daisy 's was not ; it was merely a sentimentalprejudice common to her class , and selfish to boot . September had slipped away into October , and the news from all the fronts had become more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completely smashed at Tannenberg . The " miracle of the Marne , " as the press hailed it , had temporarilysaved Paris , but the Allies were in no position to deliver a counterstroke . They might save Paris , but they probably would lose Calais . And , after Calais , what ? There was a determination to win the War on the part of the Germans which was greater than Napoleon 's determination had been . He had merely assembledthat flotilla of his at Boulogne , but had not dared to cross , in the face of the prestige and courage of Nelson . But where among the English admirals was a Nelson now to be found ? Perhaps the Germans might even produce a Nelson of their own to match their old hero of Tannenberg , Field Marshal von Hindenburg . The Germans had built up a fleet fully equal to England 's . It lay at the mouth of the Kiel Canal , protected by the invincible defences of Heligoland . German naval officers were already drinking toasts to " The Day . " They were rapturouslyp180singing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have one foe , and one alone : England ! " They were all praying , " Gott strafe England ! " Or so the English press declared . I low soon , then , would " The Day " arrive for them ? My day , at all events , must soon end . In a month at the outside I must either join the British ranks or be branded as a coward  --  or quit England and return to my own country . Meantime , Miss Lowell was writing long , optimistic letters , advising me to return and see for myself how well the " new poetry " which she had sponsored was flourishing . She was bringingout , that October , her Sword Blades and Poppy Seed , which would score , she was sure , an initial success for the cause she was championing , and she would follow this up with the publicationof Some Imagist Poets in the next spring . Ezra 's refusal to go on with her , together with the War , had killed England 's last chance to make anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the project of printing my " Irradiations , " but she wished I could come over and follow this up for myself . America was on the eve of an artistic and poetic renaissance . I had an opportunity , now , to score the success which England had so long denied me . I ought not to let it go by . Such letters still further upset my equilibrium , already disturbed by Aidington'sexpressed wish to quit England . It seemed to me that Amy was right  --  that indeed , in my own interests , I ought to return . At the end of October , almost a year to the day when , after our first yielding to passion , Daisy had gone back to her husband and children , I finally made up my mind . We had a long and serious talk together . I told her that I had definitely decided to go back to my own country . I said that I could not do Englandany service by continuing to remain as I was , and that , as she herself had pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably be killed and leave her and her children in poverty . I would continue to support her , according to the agreementI had already entered into with her husband , but only on condition that I remained in my own country as long as this War lasted . I would return to her only when it was finished , or if I could return as her husband . Personally , I wished now that I had insisted on her obtaining a divorce from the outset . I had only accepted this alternative arrangement because of her serious illness , and in order to spare her further suffering . But I had not ,  |p181at  that time , foreseen the coining of the War . The War had changed everything , and made it impossible for me to continue as I was . I knew that the arrangement I had entered into that spring would no longer work . Therefore I was returning . She listened this time quietly , her cheeks paling . Then she said that she recognized that there was much in what I had just said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since I had resumed the old life with her , I had seemed miserable and distracted , and had held aloof from any demonstrations of affection . She hoped that the War was responsible , and she did not want me to stay if that was the reason for my present state . For her part , she had tried to do everything that was in her power to make me happy ; but she knew that whenever I took an idea into my head that I had to do something , there was no way to persuade me to the contrary . Had I not , last year , gone secretly to her husband and informed him of what was going on , withoutasking her advice ? Now it was the same with this new notionthat I must go back to America . Perhaps , therefore , it would be better for me to go . She only hoped that I would not forget her . A day after this I went into London and bought a steamer ticket . The first ship available would not depart till the sixteenth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but I found , by inquiry at the American consulate , that neither the British nor the Americans would object to this , so long as I signified my immediate intentions of leaving the country which had harboredme for so many years . The rest of the time remaining was spent in packing , in making ready , in last sentimental visits on the part of Daisy and myself to the garden which had witnessed the first full avowal of our emotions . Winter was at hand and the remnants of the first British Expeditionary Force  --  French 's " contemptiblelittle army , " the " mercenaries " of A. E. Housman 's immortalepitaph  --  were dying like flies that Ypres might be held . The battleship Audacious was sunk in the Irish Sea by a daring German submarine , but the Admiralty , fearing the effect of this news on the British people themselves , tried to make it appear as an accident . As I had already written in my " Orange Symphony , " " My time is up  --  I must go . " And to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somewhere beyond the black seas and the November gales of the Atlantic lay a new and undiscoveredp182America : a country I had abandoned long ago , now perhaps awaking for the first time to its destiny as a great power . I was prepared to face it , to make what I could of it . So , and in such a spirit , I confronted the most important decision that had yet come to me in my life . The decision had been arrived at through Aldington 's dear view , through Amy Lowell 's encouragement , through Daisy 's own unreasoning and purely emotional attitude of protest . The fact that , despite my determination to regain my own country , I was leaving behind me a still unclarified situation in respect to a woman and myself , was largely lost sight of , in the hurry of my preparations . I had asserted myself at last and taken the only course left open to me . Not knowing what sort of future beckoned to me , and realizingonly that I must struggle onward to meet it , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the roughest of my entire experience as a sea-traveler , the unladen ship accomplished its task of battling through the November gales , and drew towards the American shore . We dropped anchor in New York Harbor on the Tuesday before Thanksgiving  --  a magnificent day of vivid sunlight , sparkling coldness , and clear horizons . Fresh snow lay sprinkled on the russet-red soil of Staten Island . We waited in the Narrows from twelve o'clock till four , in full view of the city in the distance , while , one after one , thousands of mail sacks were discharged from the sides of the ship into two waitingtugs . I had come home at last , having already projected my emotions during the voyage into the violent storm images of the " Red Symphony . " As we went slowly up the harbor , in the waning glory of a late autumn afternoon , I was given ample opportunity to study again the aspects of the land from which I had sprung , and which I had neglected and ignored for over six years . The Woolworth Building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ManhattanIsland , no other skyscrapers , except the far inferior Singer Building , having as yet been built near to it . It seemed , as its gilt Gothic crockets and finials glittered in the descending light , to represent the spirit of my land in a new and more victorious affirmation . Reims and Louvain and the town hall at Ypres might fall , but their spirit lived on in this cathedral of commerce , minted out of the nickels and dimes of the American people . Alas , I did not see  --  and few then did see  --  how shabby and sordid a reality of greed these same finials and Gothic spires concealed . I spent a dozen days in New York , and then , in the midst of a whirlwind of new thoughts and impressions , moved on to Boston . Amy Lowell had sent me a message of warm welcome to my ship . I dined with her one evening at the St. Regis , and knew that her hospitality and generosity were open to at least one wayfarer . I felt I was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recklessly piercing the clouds in one final effort , as long as I had one such friend . For New York was new to me  --  though at that time not all the landmarks I had known in my youth had been swept away , as they later were , under the furious overbuildingof the boom years . One of the first poems I wrote after my arrival was , in its way , an unconscious tribute to Miss Lowell . The sight of the Woolworth tower rising amid the gaunt steel frames , the travelingcranes , the rat-tat-tat of riveters at work on newer skyscrapers all about it , had caused my impressions to take shape in the new Paul Fort manner , which she had used so successfully in " The Bombardment " : Out of the black granite she is rising , surprising as sunrise over the head of the Sphinx ; glittering towers coated in linked scales that seem as if they might melt away , they are so pale .. . It seemed to me that this new form , a form far more free than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old problem that so long had tortured my mind : the problem of describing the essence of a great modern city in words . It used every resource of the poetic orchestra  --  rhyme , assonance , refrain , rhythm freely resolved and resumed in a single sustained composition of dithyrambic intent and emotional diversity . In its spontaneity , its unexpectedness , this new form was absolutely American : a linking together of Whitmanian energy and of Poesque music . It was the one form needed to release all my pent-up feelings about modern great-city civilization . America and Miss Lowell , each in their own way , had now set it in my hands . Unlike New York , Boston , seen again after an interval of more than six years , seemed to have changed little outwardly . About the only change on the surface was that the old Museum of Fine Arts which had faced the Library and Trinity Church across Copley Square was now gone , and a new museum had been built out on Huntington Avenue . I had never supposed that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I did . The entire wing dedicated to housing the superb collection of Chinese and Japanese art especially held me ; now , for the first time I understood what I  --  with my eyes still deluded by the triumphs of western naturalism  --  had missed before : how the Orient , by re/fusing to proceed along these lines , had achieved an art of such sustained spiritual intensity as the West had but rarely glimpsed in a few such figures as Cimabue , Giotto , Leonardo , Michelangelo , E:l Greco , and William Blake . The hours I spent then in the Oriental Wing , seeing the Sung or Kamakura masterpieces with new eyes , re-educated me in regard to the purposes of a pictorial art close in spirit to my own poetry , and to the functionof the poetic artist in reshaping the world . They rededicated inc to the vital instinct , and to the soul of nature . Not from the materialistic Occident , but from the traditional Orient must spring the new life-giving spirit , old and yet new , conservative and yet free @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new vocabulary , a new form and a new feeling for the interrelationof man and nature . Now more than ever I understood the nature of the task to which I had dedicated myself : to fuse the East and the West , to combine the inner insight of the Chinese sages with the restless , dynamic energy of modern America . It seemed to me that in so far as I might help in accomplishingthis task , I would not only be striving to achieve the greatestand most profound necessity of twentieth-century humanity , but that my work might possibly even lead to some advance of the human spirit that would be greater still , to some religion of the future that would combine the calm , detached self-awareness of Buddhism and the dynamic , passionate , world-awareness of Christianity . How little did I think , in those days , of my own inadequaciesfor such a task , or of the fact that the western world was so little concerned with achieving any spiritual harmony betweenman and his environment as to be ready to accept as gospel any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not less important than my rediscovery of the treasure house of Oriental art at the Boston Museum of Fine Arts were my renewedtalks and meetings with Amy Lowell . I remained , during the week I spent in Boston , a guest in her home . Ere this I had been sometimes a little disconcerted by her attitude of complacentand practical worldliness ; now I saw , clearly and inescapably , the reason why this attitude existed . Here for the first time I was brought into contact with a being who knew of no other life than the life of luxury , had never experienced any other kind of life since her earliest years . That she had at least 86partially escaped from it , had freed herself from it sufficiently to look at the world with the imaginative eyes of a poet , was enormously to her credit ; but it was scarcely enough . Before one can speak for humanity , before one can make laws or produceideas that will rule the humblest as well as the highest , it is necessary to share in imagination the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the essential task of the poet under democracy . He was right , but he had never come into close contact with such a person as Amy Lowell . Born to the superior station and wealth of her family , and so imbued with its importance in the affairs of the world , she was utterly unable to look at life from any other viewpoint . Here was one person who was doing exactly as she pleased , simply because the opportunityhad been given her , and for no other and more profound reason . Surrounded by a dozen devoted servants , with a companion and friend in the warmhearted Ada Russell , who , for her part , was equipped with all the forbearance and tact of one who had lived long in the real world and dealt with real humanity , Amy behaved as an autocrat , simply because that was her real nature and her heritage . I soon saw that I had underestimatedwhat it meant , in her case , to be a Lowell from Boston , and had overestimated her natural and human desire , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . She simply took her wealth and position for granted , and made the most of it . All this did not come to me at once . For the first few days I was charmed and overwhelmed by the beauty of her great house , with its magnificent library , its secluded garden , its air of refinementand splendor , its well-ordered ritual of existence . Comingstraight from a noisy and uncomfortable hotel room in New York , it seemed to me a haven of rest from the world . But I soon noticed that , whatever her house was , she did not live in it . Somewhere on the top floor , in rooms I never visited , she spent her days , never appearing downstairs until after nightfall . For the business of getting through the day , my hotel bedroom in New York might as easily have served the turn . The rest was for display , for a place to entertain others ; and it satisfied her own estimate of herself that she visited it occasionally and realized that she could command its resources . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be rather for appear- 81ance than for use , though all luxury is unnecessary unless it is used and enjoyed . She objected to others handling the books , and she kept the Keats collection locked away in a steel vault , built i --  the library wall . Knowing this , I did not even ask to be shown it . I would gladly have spent hours looking over the elephant folios of the original edition of Audubon 's Birds of America which she possessed , and the possession of which I envied her ; hut I refrained from pulling them out , fearing a reprimand such as befell me during my very first days , when she discovered me in the act of looking at a rare Keats volume , and told me to put it back on the shelf . So instead of enjoying the books , I contentedmyself with admiring only her flowers . A profusion of these , always renewed , was kept blooming on the library tables by her English gardener . Realizing the devotion and care these represented , I told her that I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the least annoyed by the remark ; indeed , she repeatedit to him , and no doubt he was grateful for the compliment . It may have been that my distaste for her worldliness affectedme disagreeably . It may have been that I was simply exhaustedwith being kept up by her at all hours of the night , and having to meet face to face her lack of realization of the demands she made upon others . But I did not leave Boston withoutan outburst of my own peculiar bad temper . She invited me to meet Emile Gebhard and Carl Engel , two of her oldest and most valued friends , and there was a delightful evening of music which they gave at her home . Shortly before I left for Chicago and the West , these two excellent musicians also asked me to cline with them at the Adams House in Boston . Their gesture , I knew , was motivated by nothing but their kindliness , and a desireto recognize in me a fellow artist ; but as the time drew near when I must fulfill my part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ misgivings . I knew nothing of them , nor they of me , I reflected . Miss Lowell had already shown herself to be far differentin many ways from anything I had expected . How would they turn out ? The day duly dawned , and I wakened with a dull headache and a sore throat , the sure signs of an oncoming cold . I should have telephoned Engel , whose party this was , to put him off , but I did not . Instead , I tried to feel better by remaining in bed all the morning . At lunch time I got up , put on my clothes , and joined Ada Russell at the table . She diet not realize what was the matter with me , nor indeed ( lid I fully realize it myself . At that time , and for many years later , whenever my body began to fail to respond to the demands made on it , I invariably tried to revenge myself on it by driving myself far beyond the limits of my own physical strength . It is only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respect . In the afternoon I took a lonely walk  --  and returned , with head burning , to lie down , fully dressed , for over an hour . Then I took the streetcar into Boston . Engel was awaiting me , but Gebhard did not arrive for ten minutes . To Engel I explained that I was feeling ill and exhausted . He suggested a drink , and we had a cocktail . This made my head only worse , in the midst of the noise and heat of the crowded barroom . Finally Gebhard , an older , more staid and grayingGerman with a foreign accent , turned up , and we moved off together to the dining room . With the very first course I discovered that I could not eat anything . This dinner in my honor was certainly turning out differentlyfrom what I had hoped . Engel suggested milk toast , or something light , but I rebelled against being treated as an invalid . I made a show of eating the oysters and the soup . Gebhard , whose culture in the literary sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions about myself , my work , my career . I am afraid that I cut him short , being far too weary to explain . He was soon reduced to talking only about music with Engel . With the fish course , I felt I could not swallow another mouthful . I could not eat , could not talk , could do nothing but sit and wish miserably that I had never come . I suddenly asked to be excused . If I had added that I felt too ill to go on I might perhaps have been forgiven . But I was annoyed at myself for feelingill , and did not want to admit it . So I said merely that I felt I did not want any more company that night . Gebhard , quite naturally , chose to regard this as a personal affront . " You have been acting strangely ever since you came , " he retorted caustically . " Now you want to go . Did you come here only to insult us ? " I flared up . It is always so in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able  --  had said nothing to Amy herself of the  --  demands on my time and patience which had led to this stage of utter exhaustion  --  and now I was losing my temper with someoneelse , for no particular reason , simply because I could not keep it . Poor Engel had looked acutely miserable as I failed to answer the questions with which Gebhard had plied me . No matter . This wits the last straw . Gebhard had said that I was insulting him . Very well . I would show him what a real insult meant . " Since you chose to think that I am tired of your company , you are quite right . I never asked for your company . I do n't want to sit here seeing you making gluttons of yourselves any longer . " I rushed out of the restaurant . One moment later , too late , I realized the full enormity of what I had just said . I had deliberatelycut myself off from two friends whom I might have had , and these friends had been given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her house , already an outcast , a pariah from society . If only I had not gone  --  if only I had not lost my temper ! At half-past eight or a little later I descended wearily from the streetcar and made way again up Heath Street to Miss Lowell 's l ront door . She was sitting quietly in the library , and came to the door at my ring . I must have looked acutely miserable , though the cold air was making me , in fact , feel less ill physically . She lost no time in asking the inevitable question , " What on earth has happened ? " I detailed carefully the circumstances and the causes of my affront . I literally threw myself on her mercy . She was furious , and began berating me as if I were a schoolboy . I suddenly burst into tears  --  I did not want to stand there weeping before her and yet I could not stop myself . " I will go  --  I will go , " I kept on saying , thinking that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I was really suffering , her manner changed to solicitude . She offered to telephone both Gebhard and Engel , and say that she had insisted on my going , and that I had not wanted to go  --  as , in fact , I had not  --  but had merely gone to please her . She even offered to procure me a doctor , which I refused . And she let me go to bed , after I had promised to write Gebhard and apologize in the morning . After all , I had not lost her as a friend , I reflected ; whether Gebhard or Engel liked me or not mattered far less . I inwardly resolved , however , not to let her , under any circumstances , cutp190into my hours of sleep and keep me up long past midnight , as she had done on every night I spent under her roof . I took off my clothes and slept a long sleep of exhaustion for nearly twelve hours . The next day I felt much better , and , on the following evening , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who undoubtedlyknew her habits , since he had been a frequent visitor at her house for years before her first trip to England , and who had persuaded her to read the French poets before our friendshipcame about , remained friendly to me personally , and actually helped me later on financially by persuading me to translatethe French texts for some songs by Gabriel Faure . Gebhard I only saw distantly , as he continued to come and play at her house the following spring . On my way to Chicago I stopped off at Buffalo and took a side trip to Niagara Falls , which I had never before seen . It looked savage and Scandinavian , with its banks beautiful in deep snow , and the leaden sky brewing another blizzard overhead . I recalled how Lowes Dickinson , already then a name among English intelligentsia , had said that Niagara Falls was the true symbol of America , since it displayed power carried to inhuman lengths , energy perpetually going to waste , the dramatic intensity of epic effort running on to the whirlpool rapids of death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whether it were indeed so . Certainly it would be more difficult for me or for anyone to controlthe abysmal energy of America in the future than it was for man to harness the falls , though it was claimed that it had alreadybeen done successfully . I arrived at Chicago , after an all-night train journey , in a temperature some degrees below zero . The sun was shining brilliantlyoverhead , but there was a biting wind from the northwest . The contrast between the overheated train and the intense cold of out-of-doors was so great that , on my way down State Street , I had to pause frequently and seek the shelter of doorways . I had never before stopped overnight in this city , and the contrast to New York and Boston was tremendous . Here was another America , the America of the great plains and the great Northwest , with its fierce scrambling animal energy , its vast stores of iron , copper , nickel , wheat , corn , cattle , hogs  --  a city of naive boastful greed , of childlike exaltation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of millions of ignorant immigrants , a city wherep191the hard old New England idealism had grown soft and sentimental , an excuse alike for evangelic missionaries and for civic corruption , a predatory city , carried along , since the great Expositionof 1893 , by its own naive faith in the superiority of outward mechanical effort over inward harmony . It was so ferociously , intensely young and yet so hard and obstinate . It fascinated me to watch it , and yet it terrified me ; for under the grim black shadows , of its skyscrapers I learned what Niagara Falls had already shown me : that the struggle to establish the supreme imaginative art of poetry in America could be neither a short nor an easy one . Miss Harriet Monroe , just celebrating the second anniversary of her editorship of the magazine which was already making literary history , seemed cold , somewhat dry and unemotional , and aloof . I scarcely realized what a degree of crusading ardor lay beneath her exterior , which was much like that of the schoolteachers I had known in my boyhood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manners , to the young , ardent , and far less emotionally stable Margaret Anderson , to whom Miss Lowell had given me a letter of introduction , and who had already embarked , with no funds , and no prospects except those procured by her own undiscriminating enthusiasm , on her spectacularcareer as editor of the Little Review . Miss Monroe seemed frankly disconcerted and bewildered by the explosions of modernistic literary frankness her magazine was already provoking . Especially she seemed to be in awe of Pound . And I recall that she showed me , either now or on my later visit of a week in February , a poem that Pound had just sent in from London , written , as he said , by a young American who was the most intelligent American he had ever met in London , T. S. Eliot . She did not know what to make of the poem , which was entitled " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock , " and so she asked me for my frank opinion . I read it , and advised her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ultramodern " discovery " about whom she was deeply enthusiastic was Wallace Stevens , a poet concerning whom no one then  --  or since  --  has been able to unearth or discover any particular personal history . It may be that Stevens , with his peculiar romanticism of understatement , appealed to her because of certain affinities he showed with Chinese art , about which she was glowingly enthusiastic . Her sister , Mrs. Calhoun , then living in Chicago with her husband ,  |p192was  the wife of an American minister to China , and through her Miss Monroe had enjoyed the advantage of contact with China itself , which she had actually seen and visited . I suspected that it was her own perception of the Chinese echoes in my " Blue Symphony " which had led to her acceptance of it . For the rest , Miss Monroe 's chief ambition seemed to be the desire , in which all Chicago apparently shared , to uphold Chicago and the Middle West at all hazards . Her account of the founding of her own paper , and the struggles she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , was epic ; and her chief intellectual interest lay now in the discovery of new mid-western poets . Of the three outstanding figures who already answered to that category , I did not meet Vachel Lindsay , who was not in Chicago , but at Springfield . And had I met him , I doubt if we would have agreed on any point , as I had already taken a strong and possibly unreasoning dislike to his " General William Booth Enters Into Heaven , " with its tone of a backwoods revival meeting . Carl Sandburg I did meet for a brief moment , as he sat in her office , his feet on the desk , a derby hat sloped forward over his eyes , and a stogie cocked up between his lips . He was busy correcting some proofs , and did not look up or utter a word of greeting as I entered . The sight of him so disconcerted me that I could not utter a word . The most interesting and generally illuminatingencounter I had with the mid-western group was with Edgar Lee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rejected by Miss Monroe for her magazine , was already appearing in William Marion Reedy 's obscure Mirror and causing a senationwhich grew and increased in volume as each new installment saw the light . There was not much that proclaimed the poet in Masters , or , if there was , it was such a poet as Henrik Ibsen had been before him , in mid-century Norway . There was indeed , I thought , more than a hint of Ibsen himself about Masters 's own physical appearance : the rounded , resolute face , with its fine forehead and keen eyes scrutinizing the world behind their glasses , the firm-set , determined mouth , the slow , deliberate , dignified manner . Here was one whose long and hard experience as a lawyer had given him a unique and devastating insight into the corruptions that followed fast upon the acquiring of great wealth in the Middle West . He had turned aside from the vices and scandals of modernp193Chicago to trace in a typical frontier community , such as that in which he had spent his boyhood , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the frontier significant , and the later great city life possible . The value of his " Spoon River " lay not so much in its poetical power as in the fact that it was a document of firsthand importance as history  --  history as lived and not as written in textbooks ! These epitaphs summed up , in unforgettableprecision , the kind of lives out of which the great westward migration , the American dream of free men in a free continent , the Civil War , the development of industrialism , the shameless scramble for pelf and profit , had sprung . I felt an immediate sympathy with Masters 's poetry , despite all its realism ; but in many respects the man himself baffled me . He seemed to be largely a bundle of contradictions : so much the pushing , ambitious , self-made middle-westerner , so much the aristocratic , disdainful , unaccountable genius . I remember a luncheon meeting at some Chicago club when he pushed across the table a typewritten copy of one of the " Spoon River " epitaphs and asked me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who goes abroad , does not return , and spends his life carving Apollos  --  but is nevertheless a failure , because , about all the Greek gods whom he fashions , there is the remote suggestion of Abraham Lincoln . I wondered , as I read it , whether this was Masters 's deliberate retort to Ezra Pound , to myself , and to all other Americans who had gone abroad and striven to adjust the American literary craft to its appropriate background of world tradition , so that American literary art might cease to be incoherent , such a thing of fits and starts as Poe , Whitman , or even Emerson had made it  --  so that American literary art might take its place in the rightly ordered continuity of the great tradition . I did not , however , fall in the mood to contradict Masters on this occasion , and to say to him that his sculptor , though an expatriate and a failure , had possibly striven for a more valuable kind of success than came to those inhabitants of Spoon River who stayed behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packers , and the jingo imperialists of the SpanishAmericanWar . I merely kept my peace , and handed the epitaph back to him without comment . Besides Miss Monroe and Masters , I had the pleasure on this visit to Chicago of meeting Alice Corbin Henderson , the in- defatigable assistant to Miss Monroe on her magazine and a poet in her own right , as well as the wife of a hard-working artist and the mother of a charming young daughter . She proved to be a southerner , with all the easygoing individualism that is so natural to the southerner , and with none of the angularity which was manifest in such notable middle-westerners as Miss Monroe and Masters . Her chief trait was a wholehearted generosity , which she has never lost . I found her more sympathetic to my poetry and its aim of fusing melody and vision , dream and reality , than I could have even remotely hoped for ; and she was also an ardent convert to imagism . Without her influence Miss Monroe 's paper might have been , I felt , narrower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only two years later , she was obliged to abandon her post as Miss Monroe 's chief assistant and go to Santa Fe in New Mexico to repair her shattered health , the influence she had on the early course of Poetry was decisive . New York , Boston , and now Chicago had alike checked my own drift towards a too narrowly personal and too abstractly aesthetic poetic art in the " symphonies . " I was consumed by a fresh wave of objective curiosity concerning the manifestations of real life in this strange and fascinating country . Whether those manifestations could take shape as the great imaginative myths and legendary sagas which were the substance of poetry , or must seek rather the lesser art of prose fiction , Edgar Lee Masters had himself brought sharply into question . Now I was again thrown back on myself , and on my own personal antecedents . After a stay of only two days in Chicago , I returned to my native town of Little Rock , still wearing most of the aspects which I had known in my boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being transformed by the noiseless and complete revolution in all American habits which had been so successfully engineered by Henry Ford . My elder sister , who had shared in my early education , but who had grown up to a life totally different from mine since the years I had spent at Harvard , was still living , as she has always lived , in the house associated in memory with my own boyhood . She was now married , and had already a family . It seemed strange to me to be called " Uncle John " by the youngest members of the household . There , freed entirely from the distractions of literary society , and left largely to my own devices , I spent hours in read-pt95ing Nutt all 's T'rave'ls Into Arkanaa Territory , published in 1822 , a book which helped inc to the quasi-Indian poems called " Songs of the Arkansas " which continued the vein of my " Cherokee Ballads . " I also spent further hours poking about the old house , absorbed in the rich collection of souvenirs of my boyhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its fascinatingly full attic , still displayed . Now I began to go back to my personal life again . But it was no longer the personal life of my manhood , but that of my remote boyhood ; of a shy , sensitive , possibly spoilt only son , much given to reading and dreaming , whom two adoring parents had given every advantage except that of rough , direct , practical contact with the external world , and who had been turned loose , to become quite different , possibly , from what either of them hoped or expected . Now I already stood at an immense " aesthetic distance " from this , my own past , and , frankly , it haunted me . Had I been a success or a failure in regard to it ? I did not know . Christmas went past , and New Year 's Day  --  the New Year of 1915 . The War , which had already scarred my spirit , as the latest " symphonies " and the war poems I had already written could testify , seemed far away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ links of its pre-Civil War heritage of old southern culture , and becoming rapidly a little more " progressive , " advanced , and middle-western . But now I felt that what I had alreadyseen of the European War at close range had modified my own early attitude to the Civil War . During my boyhood the stories of the Civil War that I had heard from members of my father 's generation , so much older than I , but living still on their memories of the great contest , had seemed to me at best only tedious legends . During my college years , Lincoln and Stephen Douglas , Jefferson Davis and Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson , had all been less real to me as human beings than Whistler , Rossetti , Oscar Wilde , Baudelaire , Swinburne , and William Morris . I had gone abroad because I was already tired of Americanhistory , and wished to learn something of art , which seemed to me both better and more important than history . There are still people who look on religion with precisely this attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The War had already taught me that there was no escape from history . Had the people of France been conquered by the Germans , their culture destroyed , their homes despoiled , they would have looked on their lost heritagep196no differently than the folk of my father 's generation . It would have become , to them , something so uniquely precious that nod ' ing in it needed modification , and they would have lived solely on its memory , without making any further effort . So my father 's generation had largely lived ; but I had been too young , too restless , and too aesthetically sophisticated to realize that fact . Now I saw that the Civil War had actually been fought , and what it had done to my people . The European conflict brought it all back . So , after a January visit to New Orleans to meet my younger sister and her soldier husband , a visit which brought the old South still more vividly into the foreground of my own thoughts , I found myself in the first two weeks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems entitled " The Ghosts of an Old House . " These poems , twenty-four in number , were written on themes supplied me by my own boyhood . They were far more imagistic , in the narrowest and strictest sense  --  the sense of H. D. and Pound  --  than anything I had yet written . Each was a meditation , a flight of fantasy , provoked by some object that had definitely reminded me of the past . Their poignancy resided , not in any rhetorical elaboration of detail nor in the working up of analogy between the object and myself  --  as in the case of the " symphonies "  --  but in bald , stark directness of statement . Thus I may claim for them that they are the only imagistic poems which are also purely southern poems . The later southern school of the Nashville " Fugitives , " appearing on the American literary landscape seven years later , would have treated these themes , no doubt , far differently than I. But at the time when I was writing them no one had so much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern " proletarians , " nor of the still more modern surrealists , about whom we may all be hearing tomorrow . I had to do the best I could with my subject  --  a subject that had suddenly revealed to me its significance , Of minutes dragging slowly And repeatingSome worn out story of broken effort and desire , according to the technical ability that now lay in my grasp . And it is for that reason that I may claim for " The Ghosts of an Old House , " not indeed that they anticipated the later " literaryp197renaissance " of the South , which can now apparently drag almost any novel about the Civil ' Var , written from the southern standpoint , into the lists of the best sellers , but only that they were southern and imagistic , at a time when there were no southerners who were ready to restate the thesis of the South , in any new form , at all . They covered the old ground  --  the ground of a vanished past , of unforgettable losses , of a tradition so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for me , too , poignant torture  --  in an unfamiliar way . And they aroused Amy Lowell to such admiration as nothing in all my work hitherto had yet done . It was soon after hearing me read them , later on in this spring of 1915 , that she wrote her poem " The Mirror " and dedicated it to me . I had held the mirror up to my own past successfully , and had shown her thereby , unconsciously , what she could do with hers . My stay in the South had lasted from December to St. Valentine'sDay . I had obtained out of it my polyphonic prose , " The Old South , " inspired by the aspects of New Orleans , my " Songs of the Arkansas , " and now my " Ghosts of an Old House . " I was content with this literary booty . Had I been able to discover more then , or had I been granted any inkling of the fact that , in ten or twelve years ' time , a real literary revival would take place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ North , I might have stayed on indefinitely . I might also have unlearned thereby some of the lessons of courage , of independence of thought and action , of the need for experiment in new and daring forms of imaginativeexpression , which my exile from the South had already thoroughly taught me . But now I decided not to regret that I had ceased to belong wholly to the South , nor to regret that , at twenty-nine , the South had not , as yet , even heard of my name . There was another spot on the map of America to which I could and should go ; this place was Boston . Amy 's indefatigable persistencehad already persuaded Houghton Mifflin there to take the plunge . They were bringing out , that spring , a " New Poetry . Series " in which my own Irradiations no less than her Some Imagist Poets were to figure prominently . I knew that I must be there , on the spot , to make the most of my opportunity . I must meet and stand and live , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equal terms . She herself had hoped that I would decide to settle in Boston . Her presence there was both a stimulus and a challenge to me  --  and I must meet both . So , with my trunks repacked , and with plenty of new work accomplished , I turned my back anew on Arkansas . I was not to see my native state again for twelve years.  | ON my way back to Boston I dropped off again at Chicago , where I remained for a week . I found that the chief literary topic in Chicago was only the increased sensation which Masters 's " Spoon River " epitaphs were now causing . William Marion Reedy 's obscure magazine had become almost a leading organ of American literary opinion on the strength of this one feature alone . The fierce sincerity , the detailed power of character drawing , the knowledge of American types which Masters increasingly displayed , were stirring all literary circles to their very depths . It may be that this , almost the first outstanding success which the new poetry was having , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been so , in view of what followed . Masters 's Comedic Humaine owed its renown chiefly to his power to draw credible American characters and to ; generalize about life . So far my own poetry had been largely a poetry , not of human beings , but of objects . Things still interested me far more than people  --  things and their relations to me personally , or to each other . My poetry was , as I know now , akin in spirit to the pictorial presentation of natural atmosphere and life rhythm which had been the secret of Chinese and Japanese art . Like that art , the landscape had been more important to me than the human beings . Not only Masters , but Robert Frost , who had but recently returned from England to score a sensational success with his North of Boston , seemed to concentrate their art less on the landscape than on the human figure . I wondered , frankly , whether it would be ever possible for me to do so . As it happened , Chicago 's Art Institute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A great collector of Japanese prints had left his entire collection to the Institute , and these were now being exhibited in the galleries . I had alreadybeen aware of the power of oriental art , in all its phases , to furnish subjects and to govern their treatment , for all my poems , without exception , since my writing of Irradiations.  | Now , as I visited this large collection of beautiful prints , produced by the " ukiyoyc " or " passing-world " school of painters , who were despised by the superior taste of the art aristocracy of their time , because they concentrated their skill on the depiction of daily life and on the human figure , I was stirred to make a new experiment . Why should I not use these prints as a pretext to express my own views of human life and destiny , in the shape of brief , epigrammatic poems , much as Masters had already done ? During the week I spent in Chicago I visited the Art Instituterepeatedly . There , in the galleries facing the actual prints themselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated exclusively on the earlier specimens of this ukiyoye art ; I left out of my survey the later masterpieces of both Hokusai and Hiroshige , who had carried this print-designing triumphantly into yet another field of oriental genius , the field of landscape . As I have said , I wrote fifty of these epigrams during the brief week I spent in Chicago ; I might have written more , had my stay lasted longer . Later on , these were assembled with some sixteen earlier epigrams dating from bygone years , extracted from my notebooks , and were finally published , as late as 1918 , as Japanese Prints . What I intended by Japanese Prints was a brief commentary on life and on manners , a kind of " Spoon River " a la Japonaise , more compressed indeed , and more decorative , but not less valid and direct . I was by no means convinced that Masters 's own brand of meticulous American realism had anything in particularto do with the practice of the poetic art or with his commentary on life which ran side by side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only as an arrangement of emotions , which my own poetry had largely been , but as " a criticism of life , " to employ the phrase of Matthew Arnold , then there was no reason , as far as I could see , why one should not achieve just as valid a criticism of life by generalizing as by particularizing . Poetry of this sort should be concentrated , suggestive , brief , much as the Japanese poetry itself had been . There was no need of all this proliferation of sprawling and prosaic detail . A few lines , a few details sufficed , as in the Japanese prints that stood before me as I wrote . On the other hand , the concentration of the Japanese on the Yoshiwara and on the popular theater was a limitation ; there were whole sides of life they told me nothing about , whole commentariesp201they did not wake . One could not help admiring among them such a solitary and , at bottom , such a shockingly nonoriental figure as Sharaku , who had revolted against conventionalized and expressionless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to me that when I had concluded my week 's task in weariness , and had written fifty epigrams , that I need not  --  despite its faults  --  feel ashamed of Japanese Prints . If any imagist wished to comment on life , this was the way , I felt , the comment should be made . Boston had now become my center , intellectually and physically ; except for the four months between June 25 and October 21 , I did not quit it . The friendship established between Amy Lowell and myself not only persisted , but was now actually stronger than ever . I had myself set this friendship on an equal footing , beyond all cavil as to which one of us was borrowing ideas or technique from the other , by following her into the domain of rhymed prose poems . I had already written three in this form before quitting Little Rock , in my " New York , " " The Building of Chicago , " and " The Old South , " all subsequently published in my Breakers and Granite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ add another in the shape of my " Clipper Ships , " the most genuinely popular of all my achievements in this medium . We had a long discussion , probably inspired by this particularpoem , as to what we should call this new way of writing , which stood midway between verse and prose . Amy now agreed with me that though Paul Fort 's far more metricalized Ballades may have given her the impetus , the result that she had arrived at was so complex in its use of varying rhythm as to be as unlike Fort as possible . The new form was neither , strictly speaking , prose nor verse . I thereupon remarked that its basis was the elaborately rhythmed prose of Sir Thomas Browne , De Quincey , or Melville , with this addition : that all the wealth of English rhyme , assonance , verbal onomatopoeia , was deliberately woven into it exactly as the masters of polyphony , such as Bach , had woven over their simple chorales the most elaborate contrapuntal forms . " Then what ought we to call it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fort 's half-free Alexandrines nor straightforward prose ? " " Suppose we call it polyphonic prose , " I replied , and she was delighted with my reply.  | During this spring , I am happy to think that I may have been of some further assistance to her in the preparation of her lectures on " Six French Poets , " all of which I heard delivered at Miss Putnam 's house . And now , for the first time , I was impressed with her powers , as a reader of poetry , to sway and to stir her audience . Despite the obvious physical handicap of her figure , whenever she read poetry aloud she became a great dramatic interpreter in her own right . I was personally overwhelmedby her vividly dramatic readings of my favorite Verhaeren , as well as by her reading of Paul Fort . America at that time was already ringing with the acclaim that had followed Vachel Lindsay 's first appearances on the reading platform . I did not hear Lindsay then , nor for many years afterwards ; but it is possible to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the only ones he ever read , were perfectly adapted to his manner , ever achieved so much in this line as did Miss Lowell . For one thing , Lindsay , in addition to the possession of a fine tenor voice , had an extremely mobile face , a command of physical gesture and of platform effect that might not have been disdained by his own hero , William Jennings Bryan . Miss Lowell had to depend almost purely on her voice alone . As I recall it , it was a full contralto in its speaking quality , and was reinforced by such a sense of emotional conviction and of dramatic fitness as made her audiences entirely forget the heavy body from which it sprang . Moreover , she was equally impressive , whether as reader of her own poems or of those of other poets . I have heard her read not only the French poets , but Robinson , Frost , Sandburg , H. D. , myself , and others ; and she shone in them all . Truly , the admiration she always felt for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a mere amateur to a great professional . It was the acknowledgment of one who , but for the fact of a physical handicaplaid upon her , might have been a rival . She could , and did , as Foster Damon in his Life observes , hold an audience spellbound , and reduce them to tears . So that I would not interfere either with her habits , nor she with mine , I had engaged from the moment of my arrival in Boston two furnished rooms at 9 Walnut Street , on the third floor of an old-fashioned comfortable house just off Beacon Hill , overlooking the Charles River Basin . It was there that I livedp203and wrote . The Public Library was within easy access across the Common and the Public Gardens . There I did most of my reading , till Miss Lowell furnished me with a ticket to the Athenaeum . Among its shelves I spent many hours , incidentally discovering there some poems by Thomas Holly Chivers  --  among them , his " Railroad Song , " with its curious anticipation of Vachel Lindsay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Public Library , I recall , I looked up several points for at least one of Miss Lowell 's French lectures , and occupied myself with various other matters . I generally saw Amy herself at her house , twice a week , and then always in the evenings . We would meet , read over to each other what we had written , and comment on events in the poetic world as they came up . Our relationship was thus regulated by the respect in which we held each other ; it was warm , frank , and cordial . That Miss Lowell was rapidly becoming a public figure through her campaign on behalf of free verse and imagism did not trouble me in the least . I had few , if any , ambitions to becomesuch a figure . My business was to write poetry , to push to the utmost my own capacity for creation ; and this I did . Whether or not she got the credit for her championship of the new poetry was to me a matter of complete indifference . The files of Poetry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that I granted her full credit for her achievements . She had found me a publisher , at last , for Irradiations , and for this I was more than grateful . Since I no longer now had to pay in order to appear before the Americanpublic , I was content with my position . I realized that a public career of the spectacular sort was almost an essential to her full functioning as a poet , and I was glad that she had undertaken it . I have never seen another person so richly endowed with mental energy and dynamic curiosity about life as she was during the years of which I speak . That she may have made a mistake in backing the imagists , free verse , and the new poetry generally is a question for critics . I can not pretend to anticipate , nor to dispute , their verdict . But that she did back the advance guard , that she flung down the challenge to the academic pontiffs and to the public and to the sensation mongers of that day , is not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me as well as all the other imagists in the group , with every atom of her brains , every ounce of herp204skill . And thereby she made the new poetry so nut ( h a topic for discussion that other poets , not of her group , undoubtedly profited . Not , however , if they openly attacked her . Her independent . position , her unflagging vitality , and , still more , her persistence made of her a formidable fighter . As Foster Damon is at pains to point out , in his biography , she was not of the sort to crumple up under adverse blows . The tales told of her publicly bursting into tears at various critical moments are one and all apocryphal . If they contain any modicum of truth , it must be that they refer to her final years , when , exhausted under the burden of her work on Keats , exhausted with her own prodigal overproductivity , exhaustedwith an incurable illness , she sometimes gave way . I am glad never to have seen her thus . To me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always able to take blows , and to deliver more telling blows in return . I delighted , as far as a spectator watching a supreme display of skill may delight , in the tale , as it unfolded itself , of her various battles and her many victories . Soon after my return to Boston I met , at her home , Robert Frost , whose poetry she had been the first in America to praise publicly . I understood the causes for this praise better in her case than in the case of Ezra Pound , whose admiration for this poet had so much disconcerted me , nearly two years previously , in London . It was because Frost stood in her mind for unfamiliar New England , not the New England of the cultivated and the affluent , among whom she had always lived , but the remote , shy , hermitlike New England of Thoreau and the backwoods farmer , that his work made such an appeal to her . And Frost himself , as I recall him at that first meeting , seemed to me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his type . I was struck by the Celtic dreaminess of his eyes , his quiet unworldliness , his serene detachment of manner . He sat on her sofa and said little , but I realized through and through his genuineness as a human being . Though his life had been carried on through scenes and circumstances as remote from my own as possible , and though his poetry was something from which I could not obtain anything but a clear vision of a world totally unfamiliar , which could never be mine , yet I admiredboth the poet and the man . We have met since then , and always on the same footing of distant equality . If r continued top205admire him , it was entirely because of Amy Lowell 's first generous championing of his wui k . It was still more interesting than my meeting with Frost to hear from Amy herself her own account of the various battles and skirmishes in which she now engaged on behalf of the new poetry . The imagist anthology was to appear in April , and on March 30 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was invited to New York to address the meeting of the Poetry Society of America held there . And she used the five minutes allotted to her  --  tacked on to . the end of an already long program  --  to proclaimthe virtues of imagism and to read her most recent poem in the " polyphonic prose " method , " Spring Day . " The result was a battle of insults and objurgations that went on and on beyond the written rule of the Poetry Society that poems by guests were not to be discussed , and beyond the unwrittenlaws of common decency and courtesy . Far from quelling the object of their attack , this onslaught of the conservatives simply primed Miss Lowell . Her Yankee blood was up , and she gave as good as she got , now and henceforward . She realized , once and for all , that the type of poetry she was championing must make its way , not through paeans of praise nor through sane and balanced discussion , but despite all the attacks directed against it . And her realization of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and to be determined to succeed at all costs  --  even at the cost of turning the fire of the critics against themselves . Which she accordingly did . Some Imagist Poets appeared shortly afterwards , and drew such a torrent of denunciation as has never fallen to the lot of any single volume in my lifetime  --  a denunciation only equaled , I think , in the past by Walt Whitman 's Leaves of Grass . That is not to say that this small , green-covered , innocent-looking volume , nor the two other imagist annuals which succeeded it , was in any sense equal to Whitman . But it is to say that in the midst of the hullabaloo of hundreds , all setting out like dogs to bait Miss Lowell and her present following , there was seldom heard the voice of reason or of sanity . One need only contrast the receptiongiven by the critics to North of Boston or to Spoon River , both of which appeared that spring , with the reception given to Some Imagist Poets to note the difference . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on its merits ; inp206the latter , it was not . It was sufficient that Miss Lowell was championing the imagists to thoroughly damn them . In view of such attacks as emanated from William Ellery Leonard or U. W. Firkins  --  to name but two cases  --  it henceforth devolved on the imagists to fight back , to close their ranks , to stick together . They had to praise and , in fact , even overpraise each other in order to succeed at all . They had to become the very thing which Miss Lowell and myself had tried hard to prevent them from becoming : a cult and a clique . So it happened that the furious onslaught of the critics on imagist poetry in general , and on Amy Lowell in particular as leader of it , had the effect not of killing imagism at all , but rather of intensifying certain of Miss Lowell 's own faults as a writer . The arrogant , autocratic side of her nature was henceforwarddeepened and intensified ; and deepened and intensified also was her own technical virtuosity , often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems became and remained , more and more , " external " attempts to register a certain effect . A great number of them might be listed under the title she gave to one : they might be called " Fireworks , " causing an " Ah ! " of gratified astonishment in the reader upon his first reading , but later on a feeling of wonder why the astonishment had ever existed . So it is now , with the poem in polyphonic prose which had produced the first outburst of indignation at the Poetry Society meeting , the once famous " Spring Day . " Anyone now reading this particular poem dispassionately , and carefully , will find it rather a simple , straightforward , a pleasantly phrased , even a sentimentally pretty affair . Compared to the hobgoblins of Hart Crane and T. S. Eliot , the general nightmarishness of Conrad Aiken or of many of the Fugitive poets , it is thoroughly innocuous . Yet all the fuss and fume was made over it because the critics and the public thought that Amy Lowell , the monstrously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this poem how she took her morning bath . None of them realized that the mature Amy Lowell who wrote this particular poem was an altogether different being and lived an entirely different life from the person described in it , and that if this person existed at all , it must have been in Amy Lowell 's girlhood . None of them could , by comparing the texts , see that this poem derivedp207from my own boyish exultancy as expressed in Irradiations , no less than tram my own more recent stirring up of childhood memories in " Ghosts of an Old House . " Here , as elsewhere , Amy Lowell had merely followed a lead given her by another ; if the lead landed her in a difficult position , that was none of her fault . The violence of the critical outburst over the first anthology of imagist poetry which appeared under her leadership had two very important effects . In the first place , it had the effect of making her the leader of imagism once and for all . Imagism was henceforward her ism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could do with it exactly as she liked  --  as he had once tried to do . The result was not so disastrous as it might have been , but it did have the effect of reducing all the rest of the imagists to minor figures , and made any revival of imagism impossible as long as she lived , and also after her death . The second effect was on Miss Lowell herself . After the scandalous success of Some Imagist Poets she became , of necessity , not only the Bostonian aristocrat of generous impulses which she had always been , but the Bostonian aristocrat promoted to the official leadership of a notoriously eccentric cult . That there was nothing particularly freakish about the members of the cult made no difference . All of the imagists , without exception , were seriously trying to add some new quality to English poetry as written in their time ; but this fact did not affect the estimate of the conservatives . Miss Lowell had to appear freakish , and to go on battling for freakishness , henceforward . And the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did what was expected of her , and behaved freakishly . Such are the reflections that now come to me as I contemplate Amy Lowell 's public life and career . But at the time of which I write I had no such advantage of perspective . On the contrary , I was as ardently engaged as anyone in the fight she was now making to establish imagism and to defend the new poetry . More ardently , in fact ; for I alone of all the imagists enlisted under her banner , enjoyed the advantages of physical proximity . I lived in the same neighborhood as she did ; I was able to study closely her mind at work ; I completely backed her career throughout the publication of the three anthologies , and gave no public indication of any change in my feeling until my Chapbookof May , 1920 , appeared . Therefore I think I am now en- titled to point out that her success , great as it was , was not of ' such a nature as to increase her stature as a writer . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talents , but not essentially a great writer , if one classifies only those writers as great who are able to extract out of the common and universally human themes of birth , love , loss , death , struggle , achievement , and failure , new meanings of universal import and new notes of perpetual poignancy . She was , and is , a writer well worth reading from every point of technical interest ; but it was only towards the very end of her life that she began to use her technique on themes of universally human import . Occasionally , though , even in this early period , she touched on such themes  --  in her " Patterns , " notably , in the very year of which I write ; and that she had the capacity to do so is abundantly proven . She did not care to exert it often ; and this was not so much her own fault as the fault of the public and the critics , who demanded , only too often , from her a showy brilliance of surface at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now had a publisher in the shape of Houghton Mifflin of Boston ; and my Irradiations appeared alongside of Some Imagist Poets , that spring . In this publishing office I discovered a new friend in R. N. Linscott , a tall , broad-faced , handsome , and vigorous son of backwoods New England who combined a humorous and deprecatoryskepticism about life in general with a vivid enthusiasm for all forms of artistic beauty . He became one of the earliest admirers of my own poetry , and sensing in me a feeling for nature not less keen and vivid than his own , we took many long walks and rambles together , through the countryside that lay at the back door of Boston . His special admiration was Thoreau , an admiration I shared despite all Thoreau 's abolitionism and his fanatic defense of John Brown . I could accept the rebel and the nonconformist in Thoreau , as well as the shy , sensitive lover of the wilderness . Had I not myself failed to conform to the standard set by the South ? Linscott now became my chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this day . Through him I came to understand more of the real background of New England than Miss Lowell herself could show me . It was Linscott who introduced me to another poet in ConradAiken , three years younger than myself , and about the same period of time removed from his career as a college student.  |p209Within  a month of nut meeting he removed with his wife and young son from Cambridge to to Walnut Street , Boston  --  in order , as he has since said , to be hear me , in whom he sensed a poet in many ways maturer and more stimulating to the development of his own talent than any he had met , since his companionship with T. S. Eliot at Harvard . Though he lived next door , we both ate our meals under the same roo.f , a fact which led to my seeing a good deal of him . He was , in fact , just then emerging from an early career as facile versifier into poetic independence . His first book , which had appeared the year before , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rhymed verse , and the combined influences of Keats and Masefield . His second , appearing the following spring , went rather in the direction of Masters . It was not till his third , The Jig of Forslin , written directly under my influence , and read by me in manuscript , that Ile began to develop in the direction of his own peculiar bent towards a combination of keen psychological analysis and romanticdisillusion . Something in my own Irradiations and " symphonies " set him traveling in this path , so that he was obliged , by sheer force of circumstances , to retract , or at least largely to modify , much of his own early avowed hostility to . imagism . I remained in Boston from the middle of February to past the middle of July . When I left , the battle over the imagists , provoked by Miss Lowell , was still raging violently in all the papers in America . Miss Lowell was already arranging to go . to her summer home at Dublin , New Hampshire , and I had , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ automobileto this remote village , in order to get her summer home open . It seemed to me now that the time had come for me to get away , to see the world afresh for myself , and to grasp the direction in which I could travel as a poet in the future . My experiments in polyphonic prose had already shown to me that I possessed a special aptitude for poems descriptive of places and natural scenery . Therefore I should travel as widely as possible , in order to develop this special gift . My elder sister had come north from Little Rock to Chicago , and now invited me to join her there for the summer . I decided to go , and , by letting my mind receive the impress of new scenes and environments , develop further towards the more objective kind of writing that I had recently begun to practice . Accordingly , soon after the middle of July , Ip210left . I did not return to Boston till towards the close of October . ' Long before leaving  --  in early March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a final farewell to my series of " symphonies , " in the shape of the " Grey Symphony " : Three lofty pinesAt the corners of my heart Waited apart . They only seeIn the mysteryOf the grey sky , The jaggled clouds that fly Endlessly . I was now about to follow those " jaggled clouds " far to the West , to that part of the country I had not seen since my last years at Harvard . My stay in Chicago with my sister lasted only a few days . At the close of it I went northward to a cottage facing the spruce- and birch-clad shores of northern Lake Michigan , in a country where there were authentic Indians . Here I wrote , as an afterthought and postscript to all my " symphonies , " the two poems later on included in their number , under the titles of " sexual longing and frustrationthat had been the chief motif of the original " Blue Symphony , " the latter an attempt to pierce to the heart of the passions that were now being unleashed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conformity with my original intentions in the " symphonies , " were stated in terms of subjective vision , rather than as items of objective fact . They seemed to me to sum up the chief themes of the entire " symphony " series : the themes of loneliness , of wandering , of aspiration , of conflict , of remote sublimation in mysticism , and of quiescence . With these two final fusions of dream and reality I finally put the entire series of " symphonies " behind me , and entered a fresh phase of development . On August 21 I arrived , after a brief stay of four sweltering days in Chicago , to which I had returned from my retreat in the Michigan woods , at the town of La Salle on the Illinois River , where a steamboat was waiting , ready to take me down the Illinois and down the Mississippi to New Orleans . The trip 1was to take a week , and was a special summer excursion promoted by an enterprising travel agency . I had seen it advertised in the Chicago newspapers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that to go down the Great River in a steamboat had been one of the earliest of my boyhood ambitions , an ambition held , in fact , ever since I first read the inimitable pages of Mark Twain . This ambition was now about to be realized at last . Two days and nights of the sluggish green Illinois brought us to Cairo in the early morning , and going on from there we arrived at St. Louis late in the afternoon , where other steamboats , now , alas , all vanished , were standing at the wharves , and negro dray drivers urged their mules across the brick-paved water front . We passed Memphis in the dead of night , but on the fourth day stopped for two hours at Helena , where I was back in Arkansas . The fifth day we arrived at Vicksburg , where all went ashore and inspected the battlefield where Grant 's reputation was finally established , and the South had sustained a siege that need never have resulted as it did had the southern leaders seen the situation as clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paused at Baton Rouge the next day , and by one o'clock in the morning of the seventh day since we set out were tied to the wharf at New Orleans . On the trip down I had written the series of poems , " Down the Mississippi , " in which I gave my new technique of description derived from natural objects themselves , rather than from my feelings about them , a full chance to show what it could do . And from then on throughout my life I have always felt a special kinship with the Mississippi River itself , a kinship expressed by several of my later poems . New Orleans was too stiflingly sultry to be endurable . After two or three days of it I moved on to San Antonio , which was hot too , but at least drier . It was there that I met an authentic relic of Texas ' heroic past in the shape of an old man reduced to drivinga taxicab , who recalled that as a boy he had helped haul Confederate cotton down past the border into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open range , and the great drive of the longhorn herd all the way to feed the train crews who were building the Union Pacific in far-off Wyoming , and that he had personally shot fifteen buffalo in the Panhandle , as late as 1877.  | Had I stayed in San Antonio for longer than a day I might have made a poem out of Texas life and history , with just sin Ii men as himself as central symbols of it ; but the limited state of my financial resources made departure necessary . As it was , I wrote out a brief character sketch of this incident in prose , which later , as I recall , appeared in some of the obscure little magazinesto which I was then sending many of my contributions . After a long day 's trip from San Antonio we arrived at El Paso about sunset  --  a furiously western sunset of orange and vermilion against which the peaks of that arid and vast land stood out splendid and appalling . And there we changed from the Southern Pacific to the Santa Fe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night into New Mexico . The next day found us going through western New Mexico , en route to Arizona . I was by now so accustomed to the movementand perpetual change of travel as to be able to think , and even to write , in comfort on the train . The result was another series of six poems , intended to counterbalance the seven already written during the trip down the Mississippi , and composed generally of what I saw from the train , and of reminiscences crowding back on me more strongly than ever of the **27;4677;TOOLONG trip of three months I had taken after quitting Harvard . This trip had been ray first introduction to the unsurpassed magnificence and wildness , the strange , semiMexican , semi-Indian life of the Rio Grande region . Its memories had lain absolutely fallow in me for eight years till the magic touch of the selfsame region and landscape caused them to come forth and take shape in words . Mesa-crowned uplands , dotted with yellow arroyos and sprinkled with gray sagebrush , with low , tan-colored , flat-topped Pueblo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flocks of sheep followed by alert Navajos , riders loping far to some great blue-black peak hull down in the distance  --  all this repeated itself inexactly and fragmentarily , but vividly , in the poetic sequence I then wrote on the westward rumbling train . But what was I to call this sequence ? Some of it was written in Arizona and some in New Mexico . Some had been inspired by glimpses of the Mexican life I had obtained at San Antonio  --  the " Mexican Quarter , " so much anthologized later , derives from no other source  --  and some , notably " Rain in the Desert , " " Cliff 3Dwelling " and  --  Flu . Fuel Vender " from memories of the summerspent in the upper Rio Grande region , as long ago as 1907 . I might call it , then , " New Mexican Memories "  --  and no doubt this title would have been better than the one I chose . Or I might call it " From the Seven Cities of Cibola , " using , for my own purposes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the explorer Cabeza de Vaca . I judged my readers would not understand so elaborate and farfetched a title ; therefore I called the entire set simply " ArizonaPoems , " because the train I was on , at the time , was bound for the Grand Canyon in Arizona . This title was inexact , and I have since regretted it . But two of the poems , " Mexican Quarter " and " Rain in the Desert , " proved as successful as any I had written up to that time . The only spot of actual Arizona soil that I was to stand on ( luring this trip , apart from glimpses of it caught through Pullmanwindows , was the South Rim of the Grand Canyon , where I arrived a day or so later , early in September , and spent three unforgettable days . This too was given its memorial in the shape of another poem , a poem owing everything in method and struc-t ure to the lines already laid down in the " symphonies , " and like them perhaps more revelatory of my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so far as I know , has never been successfullytreated in words . I also wrote , during that brief halt , another series of verse visions , inspired by the **30;4706;TOOLONG of just such scenes as I was then witnessing . This at last was called , in defiance of all convention and geography , " The Seven Cities of Cibola . " Judging this series to be unsuccessful , I gave them no place , finally , im my later Breakers and Granite , which was to deal altogether with my American impressions . They still remain buried somewhere in the files of the early Southwestern Review . I judged them to be didactic and nonimagistic , as in fact they were . But it was the fault of imagism never to let its devotees draw clear conclusions about life and to force the poet to state too much and to deduce rather too little  --  to lead its disciples too often into a barren aestheticism which was , and is , empty of content . I was already beginning to realize that fact there by the rim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as such , howeverp214vivid , no longer seemed to me enough ; time had to be added to it the human judgment , the human evaluation . The next stop on my journey was San Francisco , and there I stayed for nearly a week  --  a week entirely unproductive of poetical result . To anyone who like myself had been traveling the entire breadth of a continent , and so vast a continent as North America , it must have seemed strange that the continent had , after all , come to an end . I had seen San Francisco before , on a brief visit of two or three days in the summer of 1905 , a year before the great earthquake and fire had laid the old city in ruins . Now the old city with its picturesqueness , its squalor , its harbor crammed with great sailships , its seething , sweaty , smelly Chinatown , no longer existed . Almost half of it still lay in ruins ; there were vast uninhabited spaces all over the city . The other half was new , smart , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being reborn . I frankly did not know what to make of this phenomenon . Here the past , instead of sinking into lethargic decay as in New England or in the old South , had merely been wiped out at a stroke . A future was in the process of formation ; but what kind of future ? I did not know , lacking , as I did , enough knowledge of the past to pass any judgment . One could only guess that America 's characteristic energy and determination , intensifying with every milestone westward , would here re-create something . But one scarcely knew whether the new city would prove to be real or merely another illusion , to be swept aside some day as the old city had been . The Panama-Pacific Exposition , built on ground facing the Golden Gate and the sun-browned , softlymoldedfoothills of Tamalpais beyond , seemed , in its illusory magnificence , as the colored floodlights awoke and played upon its buildings and towers , to repeat the dream architecture of my own " symphonies " : its magnificence was soul-stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sea fog , rolling in from the Pacific night after night on the Exposition and the city itself , gave to both a still more elusive , intangible quality of remote unreality . San Francisco evaded me completely . All that I could say of it was that here everything stood in sharpest contrast : the fierce , external energy of American effort was completely matched by the somber , fatalistic calm and inertia of wild nature ; thep215tattling bustle of the skyscraper district was matched by the remotesmolder and silence of great redwood groves and lonely shores ; the braggart energy of the Anglo-Saxon stood cheek by jowl with the passionless calm of the Chinese . San Francisco presentedme with a theme and a problem of which I could make nothing . Was man or nature chiefly important ? The answer was given , from a standpoint more Californian than mine , ten years after my visit , in the poetry of Robinson Jeffers . My financial resources were now at an end , so I returned from California to Chicago without making another stop , in the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ largely on my own meager earnings as writer , for nearly a month , till the arrival of fresh funds enabled me to get back to Boston . Looking back on my trip  --  the longest I had undertaken since the summer of 1905 , when I was still only a college undergraduate , and when I had first seen San Francisco and so gone north to Portland , and had been for the first time fired to write verses  --  looking back now on the summer of 1915 , I concluded that it had been greatly worth while , although it had left me temporarilypenniless . I had written the Mississippi River , the Arizona-NewMexico poems , and the " Grand Canyon Symphony . " I had gone through the length and the breadth of this vast land , far more different in its backgrounds of culture and of intellectual and physical climate , than anyone who lived in it suspected , and had given my best talents to setting down what I had seen and felt of it . I had traveled from Boston to Chicago , from Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from New Orleans to western Texas , from Texas to Albuquerque , from Albuquerque to Arizona , from Arizona to San Francisco , and so back to Chicago via Salt Lake City . Recognizingin myself an ability that , so far as I knew , no American poet of that day possessed to the same extent , of being able to record the visible backgrounds of American living , rather than the life patterns of the people who lived in them , I had made a wide exploration of that background , in all its variety , as it stood there , at the middle of the second decade of the twentieth century , in the first year of the European War . I had seen , and had tried to express , both the quality and the aspects of America.  |p216ARRIVED  in Chicago about the middle of September , having I already spent my last penny on the trip eastward . Somewhere along the way , at Salt Lake City or Denver , I had stopped and pawned my watch and chain , and on the money thus obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few days . I had just enough left to put my baggage in the checkroom at the station ; then I walked to Miss Monroe 's office downtown . She was in the office , and she gallantly rallied to my support by agreeing to take the new group of my Arizona poems and to pay me at once for them . I inquired after cheap rooms , and was told by her to look for them about the North Side . By the afternoon of my arrival I was settled again . I stayed there for a month . The room I had chosen in Chicago was hot , noisy , plagued with flies and the smell of the stockyards , and as barren of comfort as Ezra Pound 's had been in London . About the only literary company I discovered were the editors of a new journal , the Dial , which had taken to appearingfortnightly . I also spent some time at the house of Mary Aldis , the wife of a wealthy Chicagoan , who lived in the outskirts . It was then or later that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Aldis was herself a playwright and a poet of the more realistic sort . She was connected with a little theater , but she did not like my play , which was too romantic to please her . All the time I was in Chicago I was hoping to get back to Boston . As soon as I scraped together a little money I set out , feeling little regret at quitting a place which was even less of a home to me than New York , though it contained no less than three magazines to which I contributed ; for , in addition to Poetry and the Little Review , I now began writing for the Dial . I wanted to go back to Boston , and settle down there and write something longer : a narrative , presumably in prose , of my adventuresand impressions during my western trip that summer . In Chicago , as I had discovered , I could neither live nor write in any comfort.  |p217When  I , arrived in Boston on Or taker 20 , 1915 , I discovered to my horror that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in price , and 1 could not now afford them . I had already put myself under obligations to Miss Lowell , by borrowing from her the sum of twenty-five dollars necessary to bring me on to Boston , despite a resolve on my part never to ask her for money . It now took me three or four days to find a suitable room . Finally one was found , a little better than my dreadful slum lodging in Chicago . It was in a part of South Boston that had been built , as I recall , just before the Civil War , and which had long since been abandoned to the Irish and the Italians . ' lucre I lived for a month or more , enduring as I best might the upsetting condition of general poverty and discomfort , and gradually growing more disillusioned with Boston itself , till the advent of fresh funds in December enabled me to move back to my old quarters . One reason for my state of comparative indigence was this . Early in the spring , before quitting Boston , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard to Daisy in England . I had written her finally that she need not expect me to return to her , unless she was prepared to bring a suit for divorce from her husband . Then I would return and marry her . Her husband had agreed to this , on terms entirely favorable to her . He was willing to let her keep the house , the children , and to let it appear that he was solely the guilty party . The case had been set down for the spring term in the English courts ; but the courts adjourned without its being heard , and it was carried over into the fall . Since that summer I had been paying , not only for my travels in America , but for Daisy 's support in England , and had also paid the fees for her lawyer in London . It is for this reason that in Chicago , and still more recently in Boston , I was frequentlyreduced to eating one meal a day . America , through such poets as Frost , Masters , Robinson , Sandburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , surely showing signs of having achieved what the critic Van Wyck Brooks , writing in that very year , had called its " coming of age . " A new imaginativeliterature was being produced , and in this process the poets had led the way . But the opposition , not only of the entrenched academic conservatives , to whom Longfellow and Tennyson spelled the last word in poetry , but still more of the nakedly commercial interests , was a terrific obstacle for anyone to surmount . The overwhelming majority of the American people were indifferent to the claims of imaginative literature . They were far more interested in the exploits of Pollyanna than in imagist poetry , which was just another stunt run by a wealthy woman from Boston , one who smoked black cigars  --  had anyone ever heard of such a thing ? The American people were still , by and large , interested only very remotely in the War , in their own backgrounds , in the tragic and impossible situation daily faced by President Wilson . They were , one and all , interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the neutrality of President Wilson as their pockets would hold . And most Americanpublishers were aware of the fact , and refused to back anything unless it continued to make money . One could only overcome the bovine indifference of the American public either by creating a public scandal , as Masters 's " Spoon River " had adroitly done , or by backing one 's own career with time , patience , and an independent income . Miss Lowell had tried to do both ; I feared I could do neither . In respect to both money and social status , she indeed enjoyed a commanding position . She had used both skillfully to create a sensation , both with her own poems and with the imagist poets . But the credit would , naturally , accrue to her and not to those who had worked with her . Of these , I was the nearest in actual geographical position , and also , possibly , in point of literary ability . But I now was forced to admit that I could not compete in any way with her for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune came my way . The stroke of good fortune did not materialize . My own Irradiations , though appearing alongside of her Imagist Poets , had sold so badly that not half of the small edition of five hundredcopies had been exhausted . I was alone and almost pennilessin Boston  --  almost , if not quite , as helpless a figure in her hands as the young Chicago poet , Maxwell Bodenheim , whom I had recently met there , and who satisfied his restless ambition by coming to Boston to visit her , in the following spring of 1916 , only to have his coat torn off his back by her sheep dogs . Meanwhile there were ominous signs that the general attitude of commercial greed on the part of publishers and public would soon be backed by something more deadly : a savage outburstp219of puritanic traction against the sexual frankness of much modern literatire . In England. , D.H . Lawrence 's The Rainbow had just been publicly destroyed . " There was talk in America that TheodureWeiser would he shut up by the Comstock Society . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blatant , self-determinedignorance of great masses of mankind ? Where could the poet escape ? My mood reflected itself in a new poem , one of the few I wrote during the months of doubt and disillusionment that followed my return to Boston . This poem , which I do not think Miss Lowell ever saw , was called " The Piano-Organ . " It was addressed to one of the various instruments of that species  --  I can still hear this particular one grinding out " La Marseillaise " and " La Brabanconne , " in keeping with a machine with correct Allied principles  --  which now haunted the streets near my second-storybedroom : In the night , At the hour when the breezes waken , And set to blowing down the gutters , And off the benches of the park , Scraps of soiled newspaper , White butterflies aflutter in the dark ; Suddenly my soul is shakenBy a piano-organ at a near-by corner . Its notes , I ) ry , distant , shrill , Quiver , stiff metallic motes ; Like the stars that stud the skyIn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us , Deaf and blind to everything one feels , Yet quivering out of their own unearthly blackness , As out of some high stiff box here set on wheels . And the children dance to it , Tattered , half-fed children dancing . They do not know the irony Of the stars which wink and slylyPocket our faith , our hope and our endeavor . The tune which sets our teeth and makes our raw nerves quiver To them is merely gay : The piano-organ plays away Courage , endurance , achievements base or clever , Bit by bit : But the children dance to it . A suave Italian stands turning , turningAt the little crank in the piano-organ 's side ; His mustaches are black and wide , Like Vittorio EmmanueleHe is a dull , dishonest fellow , He wears a mechanical grin ; But all the while he stares straight on in front of him As if he could not hear a single thing , But the clink of the coin as it strikes the edge of the curb , Flung by some unseen hand from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceases . Doubtless , it has been wheeled away ; But then it starts again to play . The worn out quivering refrainDecreasesWith which the stars salute this planet 's flight . I should like to follow it , day on night , Hearing the same tunes chink and roar , Watching the children dance to it , From house to house , from street to street , Until it paused on earth 's last shore , And at the end of the world turned up to play . And then , I wonder , would it soundIts everlasting tune , Or would the stars repeat to the dead , deaf moon , The self-same notes with which they mocked this earth ? This poem , not printed till years later in England , and still now , in 1936 , twenty-one years after its composition , uncollected among my works , represented an altogether new mood on my part , the mood of disabused romanticism with which post-War poetry later was to make us all so familiar . It seemed to me to be akin , with its mingling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pound 's unknown American discovery , T. S. Eliot , entitled " The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock , " which , months ago , I had read in Harriet Monroe 's office in Chicago . I had recentlyread it again , as it had appeared in Poetry that summer ,  |p221and  had been moved to like it better on the second time than had on the first . When I had first seen it , I had recommended Miss Monroe to print it , on the grounds that , though unlike , anything I was doing , it was very good of its kind . Now I saw , an thought I saw , that its refusal to assume the heroic , in an age when heroism  --  thanks to the industrial revolution in economicsand the democratic revolution in politics  --  had become both cheap and vulgar , was , under the pressure of adverse circumstances , my own . I was surprised to learn from Conrad Aiken , still living next door to my old lodgings in Boston , that he knew quite well the mysterious American expatriate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been classmates at Harvard , and " The Love Song of 1 . Alfred Prufrock " had been written as early as 1911 . This and the fact that Ezra Pound was now befriending Eliot , made me realize that , despite Miss Lowell 's assumption that Ezra had failed in his last chance to arouse the American public , he was , in fact , still very much alive and a force to be reckoned with when it came to the discovery of new talent . The publication , the very next spring , of the oddly named Catholic Anthology , in which he succeeded in bringing together , between the same covers , poets as diverse as Yeats , Hueffer , Williams , Eliot , and himself , soon proved I was not mistaken . I also realized , face to face with Eliot 's extreme fin-de-siecle romanticism , that the story of the actual flowering of the new poetry in America , if it ever came to be written , would be something entirely different from , and far more complex , than what either Miss Lowell or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poets as various as Lindsayand Eliot , Sandburg and Stevens , all derivable from America , .111 ( 1 all practicing their art in the same period of time . More and more now I came to realize , in my meetings and talks with Miss Lowell , that we stood in different worlds . Her battles on behalf of the imagists , as well as the success of the first took she had written under the imagist influence , Sword Blades and Poppy Seed , had accustomed her to be overwhelmingly optimistictowards what she defined as the new poetry . It now frankly seemed to me that , in speaking of this new poetry , she unconsciously confused it with her own poetry . If any opposingtype of new poetry ventured to show itself above the literary horizon , she only too readily brushed the intruder aside , or didp222her best to belittle it ; as in the case of the poetry of I ' hot , Aiken , and the contributors to Alfred Kreymborg 's anthology , Other .. I realized both her energy and her determination , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If imagism had produced her poetry , and her poetry was the new poetry , the question then naturally arose , was this new poetry so new after all ? There was nothing  --  we had already in our talks agreed on that point  --  particularly new about imagism . It was but a more lyrical , a saner and more intelligible , development of the aesthetic theories of the English Pre-Raphaelite poets , the Parnassians and the symbolists in France . To it , the chief object of a poem was to produce a certain aesthetic effect ; that effect was implicit in an image or a series of images , and the business of the poet was to present his images as clearly and concisely as possible . She had been spurred by these ideas into writing a kind of poetry impossible to anyone not born to a large fortune and moving in the most intellectually advanced , cosmopolitan circles of Boston  --  a kind of poetry which did for American poetry what her elder contemporary , Mrs. Jack Gardiner , had already done for Americanart  --  filling a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do this was not to be new , particularly . It was rather to be out-of-date , old-fashioned . The new poetry , if it ever came , might well turn out to be something more brutal and realistic , on the lines of Masters and Sandburg , or something more intensely aesthetic and restrained , on the lines of Eliot and Wallace Stevens . The battles she had already waged to get a hearing , in the face of competition from the conservatives , from the midwestern poets Miss Monroe had discovered in Chicago , from Pound and his following in England , from the extreme experimentalists which Alfred Kreymborg was now printing in his Others had so transformed her that , in continuing to wage her poetic war , she scarcely now realized that the imagists with whom she was associated existed at all . Soon after my return to Boston I was asked by her to intervenein a quarrel between her and Aldington , now come to a head after smoldering since the preceding spring . As I have already pointed out , Aldington had felt , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his business as poet and man of letters not to be swayed by mob sentiment into offering himself as a futilep223and inglorious sacrifice . His only chance of escaping from the trenches lay in coming to America , which he might still accomplishas long as Great Britain did not adopt the conscription act , or if he could persuade the authorities to release him for some work they judged to be of importance abroad . Both possibilities were becoming more and more remote . But as early as the spring of 1915 he had met an American who had fired him with the prospect of becoming editor of a new literary magazine in the United States . He had eagerly grasped at this opportunity ; however , to undertake the task successfully he needed further financial backing . Amy had at first promised him this backing , and then  --  faced with some losses in a theatrical venture of her own in Boston  --  had withdrawn her offer . Now , urged by the desperate appeals of Aldington 's wife , she had seen fit to renew it , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stating that both H. D. and he were preparing to quit England , provided she could use her influence to get him released , by publicizing the fact that he was coming over to edit a magazine of strong pro-Ally sympathies . To this she now raised immediate objections ; but her objections , I felt , sprang less from her own lack of sypmathy with the Allies  --  she had , in fact , more hatred for the Germans than anyone in the whole imagist group  --  than from her fear that Aldingtonmight prove difficult to . handle , and might cause her some further financial loss . She now turned to me , and practically begged me to write to Aldington myself and to tell him that , in my opinion , the time was not favorable for launching so ambitious a venture as a new magazine in America . To say that I was astounded at this request was putting it very mildly . I knew little of Aldington , except that he was an Englishman ; but I knew enough of the English to understand that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spirit of fair play . It seemed to me , frankly , that she was not playing fair with Aldington . Could I say so , being , as I was , the recipient of so many favors from her ? Her request to me to write and finally discourage Aldingtonfrom attempting to come over put me into a complete moral quandary . Either I must rouse all her anger , and so undo the alliance I had myself made with her , or else become the subject of Aldington 's very just resentment . In the end , I capitu- lated , and , as I recall , wrote a letter of which I was heartily ashamed . She saw it , and approved of it before it was sent ; but from then on , I never again referred to the subject  --  and from then on , I realized that we no longer stood together as friends , but rather as potential enemies brought together by mutual necessity in alliance , and now engaged in hostilely watchingeach other . So , speedily and completely , were vanishing all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America ! I had been in my own country now for a full year , and all that I had got out of it was a summer packed full with vivid travel impressions , and the prospect that , whatever I did in the future , I should have to ascribe all the credit to Amy Lowell . Small wonderthat I began to feel discouraged again , as I had at the end of 1913 and 19141 For the third time now in the last three years I had attempted a fresh start , and for the third time it was leading me into a blind alley . Houghton Mifflin were now so skeptical of the success of their " New Poetry Series " that they were doubtful whether they would bring out any further volumes , except Amy 's imagists ( which she paid for ) in the spring . So it seemed altogether likely that my " Symphonies , " which were now ready , and which represented , as I felt , a development of imagism beyond Amy 's powers , would not see the light . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the furore caused in academic circles by the new poetry , was busily engaged in recruiting critics who would defend it . She had already captured William Stanley Braithwaite , chief poetry critic of the Transcript , and she spoke enthusiastically of capturing Louis Untermeyer . Braithwaite I knew to be harmlessand lacking in critical standards . His poverty and , still more , his negro blood had worked so long against him that he was prepared to be anyone 's sworn defender from the moment he was invited to dinner . But the thought of Untermeyer as a potentialally made me more doubtful . I knew nothing of him except that , as a poet , he had been a staunch champion of the Whitmanian , cosmic , " social brotherhood " type of verse . He had defendedthe poets of this type long ago in the columns of Harold Monro 's magazine in England , asserting them to be the most important poets in America . He also was a writer of clever parodies of other poets . I felt that , on all three counts , he wasp225a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him seemed to be an interest in literary politics , rather than in poetry . In my growing distaste for her tactics I now turned more and more to Conrad Aiken , who still lived next door to my old lodging at 9 Walnut Street , and who had spent the summer writing the first of his tone poems , The Jig of Forslin , at that address . Hitherto I had known him chiefly as a shy and remote , sandy-haired figure , blinking behind his glasses , who lived next door , cherished an ambition to write poems combining the sensuous lyricism of Keats with the stark realism of Masters , disliked imagism and all its works , but confessed to a paradoxicaladmiration for my own poetry . Now I decided that the time had come to take him behind the scenes and reveal to him some of the inner history of imagism from the time when Pound had first taken it up to the time that Miss Lowell had begun to use it as a means to gain a growing public . I also spoke to Aiken about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was impressed , as he has since said , both with the mature originality of my own poetic attitude and with the difficultiesI had encountered in getting a hearing for my work . Ile accordingly introduced me to a dark-haired , **27;4738;TOOLONG named Brown , who occupied two floors of an old building near Scollay Square and the courthouse , where he was running , on next to nothing , a publishing firm by the name of the Four Seas Company . If Houghton Mifflin failed to producemy " symphonies " in their " New Poetry Series "  --  in which Aiken , too , was interested  --  Brown might be worth falling back upon , as alternative . Brown proved to be amusing  --  an equal compound of adventurousdaring , Yankee resourcefulness , and complete irresponsibility . Like Aiken , he was younger than myself , and he had sprung early into the game of publicizing the new poetry . His plans for a poetry magazine and publishing house had matured so rapidly  --  thanks to the enthusiastic support of a fellow Bostonian , Edward J. O'Brien , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go to press with his Poetry Journal a month beforeMiss Monroe 's Poetry was scheduled to make its appearance in Chicago , a fact which caused Miss Monroe to advance the date of her own publication , amid much perturbation . As Ip226had neither seen nor heard of the Poetry Journal before meetingBrown in the late fall of 1915 , I was interested to learn t i others besides Miss Monroe and Miss Lowell had been stirred by the possibilities of a revival in American poetry at so early a date as 1912 . I obtained copies of the Poetry Journal , agreed to contribute to it , and asked him to introduce me to Edward O'Brien , who was now living in the country , on Cape Cod . He promised to do so , and there , for the moment , the matter rested . I was considerably more interested , at the moment , with the development of Aiken 's own poetry in his Jig of Forslin than in Brown 's publishing venture . It seemed to me that , in this sustainedtone poem , with its variation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realism to wild romanticism , my next-door neighbor on Beacon Hill had achieved a new kind of American poetry , owing something certainly to Eliot and to myself , but no less modern in its implications than the poetry of either of us , and only likely to suffer because of the facility with which he produced it . He was now , as I learned , already engaged on a second long symphonic narrative , The House of Dust , which moved me even more strongly than did the first . It seemed to me time that Miss Lowell should recognizeAiken 's talent , and should admit that a poet no less remarkablethan herself inhabited Boston , despite the fact that , as she and I both knew , he had opposed the imagist poets publiclyon their appearance . Accordingly , on a night early in December , I deliberately tried to defend him in a conversation we had together at her house , which resulted in an interchange of letters on our part , both of them so amusing and so revealing of our personal attitudes that I give @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Tonight you said a thing Which left me much upset and wondering . You seemed to think that rhyming was so hard , To have the knack made any man a bard . To turn out couplets fast as you could think Was quite a worthy use of printer 's ink . But , pointing to your friend whom I 'll not name , I said his verse would put a child to shame.  |p227To  reach the end within a given time And wind up sharply with a tidy rhyme , Seemed to call forth a terrible commotion , And make his brain whirl like a stormy ocean . Such tricks he used to cause his words to fall Each on its accent ! And that is n't all . Some verbs expanded with that fearful " did , " Others condensed , and nothing neatly hid . Was that a style of which one could be proud ? I asked you , and my horror cried out loud . You shook your head . " He rhymes so easily , " You sadly murmured . " It amazes me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it too . " But he does not repeat his rhymes , " said you . I told you I could rhyme for half a day , You doubted me . And now , behold my way ! Not wishing to admit that I 'm defeated , I 've done the thing , and not a rhyme repeated . I could go on like this till you were dead , But it is late , and I must go to bed . I 've proved my point , and if these lines do n't go well , They took me just ten minutes . AMY LOWELL . P. S. The postscript holds the letter 's kernel , So tell me , did you take the Poetry Journal ? To which I replied promptly , the next morning , DEAR AMY , Many thanks for your effusion . I quite agree that rhyming 's a delusion . Still many a rhymester might turn out a poet , If , with his gift , he knew how to bestow it . As for our friend , whose name I need not speak , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p228Ile  may be fool , he may be merely knave , Destined to fame , or to an early grave . A year ago he said he had an offerTo edit that bad Journal ; he refused the proffer . I 'd rather see him in that job than Brown ; He might have given the rag some pale renown . His rhyme 's not everything ; for aught I know , He really does his best to break their flow . He may be honest , really ! Who can tell ? Besides , I like a thief who pilfers well . Nine tenths of all the poets in this land Ca n't write as well as he : we are a bandSo small ( excuse this running on without a pause ) We ought to overlook his obvious flaws . But if we can not ; urge him to do better ! We are the gainers by it ; he , our debtor . So I conclude : excuse me if I stammer . I hope I 've kept the laws of speech and grammar . If I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but your servantJOHN GOULD FLETCHER . P. S. Two couplets less than yours ; but yet I claim In neither letter are the rhymes the same . Relying on your judgment and inspection I 've left mine here with only one correction . As for the Poetry Journal , which you miss I have n't got it . Heaven knows where ' t is . Amy had already skillfully maneuvered herself into a prominentposition as the first president of the newly organized New England Poetry Club , thus offsetting the opposition of the Poetry Society of America in New York , which had been manifest since the meeting of the preceding spring . Now , the meetings at her home which had once been frank and full discussions of new poetical ideas between her and myself  --  with Mrs. Russell for solep229audience  --  became more and Vlore public affairs , to which I was invited because my presence might add weight to the impressionshe was producing on her audience . I now met at her home , not only Braithwaite , who had become an ardent admirer , but the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grace Hazard Conkling . Of the two , Mrs. Marks struck me from the outset as being the more false . She was a Victorian sentimentalist to the core , having been reigning queen of Boston poetry circles back in the days when Amy herself was a struggling novice ; and her poetry , to my eyes , revealed only an arch-prettiness of phrase akin to the achievements of the well-bred ladies of the eighties who specialized in china painting . She had nonetheless jealously guarded her supremacy as America 's great woman lyricist down to the days of the European War ; but she was now , I could see , a waning star , so consumed by envy at the thought of Amy 's growing public following as to be ready to attack her on any provocation that offered  --  though Amy continued to profess an admiration for her poetry , and also continued to regard her as a friend . I , personally , found Mrs. Marks insupportable , after a few meetings . I was more intrigued , and a shade less doubtful , about Mrs. Conkling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own verse , genuinely interested in Amy 's ideas and in mine . And she had a remarkable daughter , who at the age of twelve was already turning out excellent specimens of imagism . Whether these poems , later published with an enthusiasticpreface by Amy , were actually written by Hilda Conkling , or were skillfully revised by Mrs. Conkling , I did not know . But at any rate , they seemed to me to be good examples of what Amy herself meant when she spoke of imagism . If Mrs. Marks and Mrs. Conkling were remotely understandableas adjuncts , then the Untermeyers , in my eyes , were not . I determined to have as little to do with them as possible , and to resist to the end Amy 's attempt , frankly stated within two months of my return , to include Mrs. Untermeyer in the forthcoming Imagist Poets . Unfortunately , I could not resist Amy 's determination to have me meet them at her home . Early in February of 1916 she rang me up and informed me that she was sending her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car would also contain the Untermeyers . She asked me to be especiallyP230nice to them . I resented this suggestion that my behavior was something that could be turned on and off for the benefit of any new friends of hers , and I determined to be on my guard . At a little before seven , the car duly arrived at my door . I was wearing my usual sack suit and overcoat , having long ago , in Amy 's presence , dispensed with the formality of evening dress ; but not so the Untermeyers . A glance at the male member of the family revealed a young man resplendently handsome iii swallow-tailed coat , white waistcoat , finely starched shirt front decked with a row of diamond studs , white gloves , and tie . Mrs. Untermeyer was attired to correspond . I got into the car with barely more than a gruff handshake . I then sat silent , deciding that it was up to the Untermeyers to do the talking . He opened upon me at once , as the car sped down Beacon Hill past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , Fletcher , because I thought I knew something about poetry until you imagists came along and told me I was mistaken . You write in such extraordinary forms . I thought I knew all the old-fashioned forms of verse  --  odes , ballades , sestinas , sonnets , triolets , quatrains , and the rest . But you have now discovered new oriental forms , Chinese and Japanese forms , in which to write . Tell me something about those orientalforms . " " I suppose you mean hokkus , " I said , irritated at the nature of this attack , with its clever assumption of ignorance . " That 's it , hokkus . Tell me , why do you write in hokkus ? You do write them , do n't you ? " As a matter of fact , I had never written a hokku in my life . My whole concern , ever since writing Irradiations , had been to create a new , rather than to copy any given and fixed , poetic form . I was determined to achieve the utmost freedom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either eastern or western . The rules of Japanese versification mattered to me as little as the rules of English versification . I was about to tell Untermeyer so , when it suddenly occurred to me that this time it would be better to dissemble . As a brief example of what I had meant by imagism , I had written that winter a five-line poem , inspired by a view of skaters moving over the surface of a frozen pond , which had seemed no less interesting to me for the clear image conveyed than for the fact that this image had seemed top211gain power and swiftness from an adroit combination of a and o and oo and long and short i sounds . It went as follows : Black swallows swooping and glidingIn a flurry of entangled loops and curves , The skaters skim over the frozen river . And the grinding click of their skates as they impinge upon the surface , Is like the brushing together of thin wing tips of silver . " Yes , " I replied , " I have written hokkus . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all about ice hockey . Shall I repeat it to you ? " A gasp of astonishment , followed by a gleam of appreciation , came to Untermeyer 's face . I had not surmised how dearly lie loved a pun for its own sake . That I could combine " hockey " and " hokku " in the same sentence made me a person of some importance in his eyes . He immediately asked me to repeat the poem , and declared that it was excellent . During the dinner that followed  --  when I chanced also to meet Stark Young , newly come to Boston to see Miss Lowell  --  he did not attempt to attack either inc or my poetry . The second issue of Some Imagist Poets , scheduled by HoughtonMifflin to come out that spring , was already causing more trouble among the representatives of imagism concerned than had the first . Then the chief difficulty to be got over had been the fact that Pound might possibly attempt to stop the publication of an imagist anthology in which he did not figure . Now there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the first place , I had proposed a fighting preface , attackingopenly and by name all the conservative critics , which Miss Lowell declined . In the second , she had become so completelycaptivated by the Untermeyers as to propose that Mrs. Untermeyer be added to the anthology . This I , in turn , refused to grant . In the third , the three English contributors  --  Aldington , H. D. , and Flint  --  had all disliked one of Amy 's own recently written New England dialect poems , " Off the Turnpike , " and had voted against the inclusion . In the fourth , D. H. Lawrence , who had been added to the imagist ranks through Amy 's own insistence , now sent in a poem so sexy in quality that she herself judged that the printers would be inclined to think it obscene . She thereupon rushed to the telephone , askedP232for Ferris Greenslet , the head of the film , and react the offending poem to him in a loud voice , concluding with , " Now do n't you think that is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assured me , a few days later . These differences were gradually ironed out . Since HoughtonMifflin not only now definitely agreed to bring out Some Imagist Poets but also relented from their earlier attitude and decided to add my " symphonies " to the list of forthcoming volumesin the " New Poetry Series , " I wisely decided to let things take their course . It was altogether likely that I would be leavingagain for England as soon as summer came , so I thought it best not to cause further trouble , but to let Amy go her own gait , still preserving an united front against the world . But I was frankly now becoming weary of her society ; and I longed to get away into a more congenial mental climate , away from all this public lecturing and publicity-seeking in Boston , to face the problemof my own direction afresh . The chief event of March , 1916 , was my meeting with Edwin Arlington Robinson at the home of Lilla Cabot Perry . Although I had heard , long ago , from the lips of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poetry , I do not recallhaving actually read any of it before this spring . I had known only that he was an older poet of the Masters and Frost generation  --  MissLowell , despite her years , belonged rather with the young  --  and that he was a conservative in manner , if not in matter . After appearing since 1896 in a series of obscure volumes , he was now about to publish The Man Against the Sky , which broke a silence of six years and which he himself regarded as his best effort . I had already read the title poem , and had been impressed by its attitude of stoic resignation , and of patient , questioning agnosticism  --  an attitude I was to discover later in Thomas Hardy . Although such an attitude had been foreign to my work , with its more obvious exploration of the primary emotions , I felt that I was now approaching it . And it was for this reason , no less than for the reason that he had slowly built up his own position as a poet through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Robinson . The man himself , with his dark , ascetic face , his tightly pursed mouth , and his shy , sensitive , appealing eyes half-hidden behind glasses , impressed me deeply with an attitude of lonelyp233integrity iii defeat -- an attitude , so far as I could see at that date , utterly alien to most Americans , or to the popular conception of Americans . He intrigued me , but as the occasion was a public one , I was not able to speak to him privately . I was only able to wonder whether , with his strong bent to regular verse forms , he would ever be able to see eye to eye with such a free versifier as myself . I was only able to watch , while with his eyes closed he sat listening to Amy reading aloud his poems , having first declined to do so himself . I admired his attitude , but I realized that he had come into the period when poetry again became a matter of public interest , largely through accident . Under any circumstances , he was and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since I knew that I would shortly return to England , to resume my life there  --  for I had now ceased to envisage any other possibility  --  I devoted the remaining weeks of March and April to an examination of America 's position as the most powerfulneutral not yet engaged in the great European War . After the breakdown of the great Russian offensive in Galicia in the spring of 1916 , the cause of the Allies seemed frankly desperate . And when the seasoned German army in the last weeks of March launched its great attack on the fortress ring of Verdun , everyone expected the Allied line to give away , despite the French boast that " they shall not pass . " On the face of this situation , all signs pointed to a victory for Germany , or to a drawn contest . PresidentWilson had so far steered a wise but increasingly difficult course through the threatening waters of neutrality . Yet though pro-Ally and pro-German sentiment neatly balanced in most of the large cities of the eastern seaboard ( they certainly balanced pretty accurately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible for the American president to retain this attitude much longer . Sooner or later another such incident as the Lusitania sinking would occur , which would inevitably lead to war . President Wilson 's position , I thought , was growing to resemble more and more that which had faced Abraham Lincoln at the outbreak of the Civil War . Sooner or later , however unwillingly , he must come out for one side or the other . As a moderate , he , like Lincoln , had not wished war ; but as president he could not rule over a divided Union . As the successful candidate of the dominant party , he was driven by extremists on both sides , no less thanp234by the provocations already submitted to , into taking extreme measures . It seemed to me now time that I should investigate the life and character of Abraham Lincoln . I had hitherto scarcely been interested in reading any detailed account of his career , having been brought up in the old southern belief that he was kindly but mistaken , able but ineffectual , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the victim of an assassin 's bullet at the end , just at the time when the prostrate South most needed his efforts at conciliation . Now , during the last weeks in March and the first two weeks of April , I read several books on the Civil War , and rounded them off by going through Herndon 's homespun , but honest , biography . I soon saw Lincoln in a new light , as the last of the heroic pioneers who had conquered this continent between the Louisiana Purchase of 1803 and the discovery of gold in California in 1849 . Lincoln 's virtues , the virtuesof the simple , homely , unsophisticated , gangling , crude and shrewd and vigorous prairie backwoodsman he was , shone by contrast , not with the planter or mercantile aristocracy that had preceded him , but with the regime of industrial and financial corruptionthat had made use of him to insure their triumph , and had followed up his assassination with a complete seizure of power . Lincoln , no less than the South , had been defeated by the Civil War @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the spring of 1916 , to be facing the likelihood of a coming defeat in the situation created by the European War . On April 19 , 1916 , the day of the anniversary of the battle of Lexington , I sat down to write my poem on Abraham Lincoln  --  the first truly patriotic poem I had written , patriotic in the same sense that Emerson 's " Concord Hymn " and Whitman 's " Drum-taps " and Moody 's " Ode in the Time of Hesitation " had all been patriotic poems . It was also the first poem I had written in which my mind came to terms with the Anglo-Saxon strength of Biblical phraseology ; the first I had written in which I said plainly that the epoch of America 's pioneer strength and greatnesslay in the past , not in the present ; the first I had written in which the technique of imagism was complemented by stanzas expressive of nothing but plain , unabashed , didactic purpose . Strangely enough , it was also the first important poem I had written since my coming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reader did not happen to be Amy Lowell . On the day after I finished it I chanced to have a caller in the shape of young Edward O'Brien , whose acquaintance I had recently made through Brown . He listened to me while I read it , and was so enthusiastic that he turned up again the next day and demanded that I give him a copy to appear in a new poetry magazine which his friend Braithwaite was preparing to bring out in Boston . I had , by this time , become so impatient of Amy and of her seeming assumptionthat I owed her everything , and that she was making my career no less than her own , that I let O'Brien take away the only available copy . Amy did not see it until it appeared in May . Braithwaite paid me , as I recall , exactly fifteen dollars for it  --  a miserable sum compared with what I knew to be its worth , but I felt glad that I had actually now begun to place poems by myself .   WITHIN a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poem , I was embarked on a Dutch steamer leavingNew York for England . I thus put behind me , not only Amy Lowell and her circle , not only my scarcely begun career as author , but also my own country in favor of a life which offered , as prospect , only another venture into the unknown . All that I actually knew of Daisy , whom I was now sailing to Englandto marry , was that she was some years  --  I did not know exactlyhow many  --  older than myself , that we had come together under strange and unusual circumstances , that we had been through a hard and troubled courtship to be followed by a brief interlude of a few months of happiness , followed by fresh separationand a year and a half of anxious waiting ; and that in now going from my own country to hers I was plunging headlong into the dangerous proximity of the European War . The prospect was an uncertain one at best , but the thought of the love that had sprung up between Daisy and myself made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possessed any of the canny commercial sense that had marked the actions of such an intelligent Yankee as Miss Lowell , I might indeed have hesitated before going abroad again . I might have informed Daisy that , since her divorce was about to be made absolute , I expected her to come over and join me in America ; but I had scarcely envisaged such a possibility . Since a night late in April , when I had been moved to warn Amy that I would shortly be returning , I had become only the more recklessly determined to get back to England . She had asked me why I had come to this decision . I had informed her frankly that it was because I now expected to marry someone who had been still married to another at the time of my departure , whereuponshe remarked that she had already suspected as much , and pressed me for further details . When I began to offer these , and to go over the events which had led to my present situation , she had abruptly cut me short with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of deceiving a woman 's husband . I had involuntarily risen and , trembling from head to foot , started to quit her house , but in the end had checked myself sufficiently to remain . But I repeated emphatically to her that I wished my decision , as well as my , personal affairs , to be respectedand not discussed . Cost what it might , I would and must now go abroad to the woman who had waited for me so long . Before I left I had come to an agreement with Houghton Mifflin to bring out the " Ghosts of an Old House " and the " symphonies " as a new volume in their poetry series , under the title of Goblins and Pagodas . I had also among my papers the half-written contents of a second volume , to consist entirely of my poems and polyphonic prose pieces about America , to which I had only recently added a postscript in the shape of the polyphonicprose " America , 1916 . " To this book I had not as yet given a title . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the love poems I had written during the whole period of my relationship with Daisy , from the fall of 1913 down to the spring of 1916 , divided into five parts . This I had already , provisionally , called Love 's Tragedy . With this much accomplished I sailed , within five months after my thirtieth birthday . Had I not gone , I know now that my life would have been totally different  --  possibly more interesting than it has been , and almost certainly more outwardly successful . Apart altogether from the fact that I never succeeded in my aim of adjusting myselfcompletely to the woman I married , nor she to me , there remains the additional fact that when I did return to America , in the summer of 1920 , four full years had gone by , and anotherliterary generation already held the stage . My opportunity was now lost because I had not seen fit to do more than half realize it . That truth must , in any case , be faced and stated . Still , I am far from regretting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences in 1916 , I might have been less reckless in 1913 and remained an obscure scribbler of conventional verse , instead of the author of Irradiations . It was not for nothing that I had admired Nietzsche and his remark about destiny being the dice table of the gods . I remember little about this voyage across the Atlantic , except that , as the ship was a slow one , it took over nine days . The ship was a neutral , and displayed that fact prominently in electric lamps on her side . There was no particular fear of submarines . A few jokes were made on this subject on the last day of the voyage , but that was all . The passengers were a mixed lot , and openly avoided clubbing with each other . Many of them  --  the ship was crowded full  --  had waved Union Jacks on leaving the docks of New York ; others had as openly displayed Germanflags ; several had stuck to the Star-Spangled Banner . The voyage was monotonous and uneventful , and no news bulletins of any sort were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a perfect , sunny , cloudless day , we dropped anchor finally in Falmouth Roadstead . Those who were going to land in England were orderedinto the smoking room , where we sat from one o'clock till past five , for the examination of our passports and papers . The ordeal that awaited us was one well calculated to impresseach of us with the seriousness of our situation , henceforward , in England . One by one , each of the passengers approached a table set at one end of the room . At the table were three men , one from the Home Office who sat directly facing the passenger , and two others from Scotland Yard , on either side , who looked intently at his face during the inquiry . After an examination of papers the passenger was requested to state his reasons for coming to England , what he proposed to do there , how long he intended to stay , the address to which he was traveling , and the like . I noticed , just as I approached the table , that one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had just arisen and given place to me : " I 've seen that man somewhere before . " The other instantly replied , " We 'll look after him ashore "  --  a remark which caused my own nervousness to increase . Anyway , when I arrived at the table and sat down I found I had scarcely the voice to convey above a whisper the information that I had come to England to marry . At about six o'clock the tender was full of all those who had been granted landing cards , and at six-twenty ( or rather seven-twenty by the new daylight-saving time that prevailed ashore ) we disembarked at last on dry land . It was a singularly perfect day , with swallows skimming over the low green hills , densely wooded , that bordered the Fal Estuary . The charm of " England 's green and pleasant land " was as potently lyrical now as ever . But the flag on the flagstaff at the pier was hanging at half-mast . A London paper , hurriedly bought , informed me thatP239EarlI Kitchener had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the preceding clay . It was already past one o'clock in the morning when the train finally arrived in London , and I took lodging in a hotel near Paddington for the night . The spectacle of Falmouth Harbour , with its groups of idle , three-masted , captured German nitrate ships , its green-bowered hills , its square belfried churches , its serene peace , had lulled my soul to calm ; but in the midst of it there was this strange disquieting news that Earl Kitchener was dead , at the bottom of the North Sea . And the next morning I learned from Daisy herself a still more disquieting fact : that while I had been on the Atlantic Ocean , on May 31 to June i , a great naval battle had been fought off the peninsula of Jutland , which had shattered , once and for all , the myth of absolute naval invincibility established by Nelson , and which had led , not to the destruction of the German High Seas Fleet , but to its only too successful escape in the darkness . Perhaps , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalling losses of the British , this was a foretaste not of England 's victory , but of England 's coming doom . As I sat there , listening to Daisy talk in the sunny drawing room of the suburban home which had seen so much of our love-making , looking at the books and pictures , the furniture and the rugs which I had left behind and had not seen since 1914 , I wondered what my life would be like with the woman who was so soon to become my wife . She was telling me now that everyone despised President Wilson for his apparently supine neutrality , that Americans were much disliked for being " too proud to fight , " that she had a hard time to say a good word for them before her friends . . . . She looked sad and subdued , I thought , as if she really had suffered . I decided to say nothing about the violently anti-Ally sentiments I had noted in Boston , which had flared up again that spring and become more vocal , ever since the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good in mentioning , even , that I was an American , and , as such , bound to strict neutrality . I had come over especially to marry her . She was glad that I had come . I would do my best now to keep any qualms to myself , and not disturb her share of happiness . My business was only to make her feel cheerful . My coming , so long delayed , had been so anxiously awaited thatp240when I finally arrived she was less disposed to laughter than to tears . The children greeted me warmly ; their mother had been worrying herself almost sick about me ever since I sailed . I had only been a night or two in London , established in a suburban hotel within easy walking distance of the house  --  our marriage had to be postponed owing to an unaccountable delay over the granting of the final decree of divorce  --  when one night I experienced the shock of my first zeppelin air raid . Suddenly , all the lights in the hotel were shut off , including the light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reading . People began callingout in excited voices , began feeling their way along darkenedcorridors . By looking out of my window I could see the sky stabbed with repeated searchlights . Soon after there came from far off , and then nearer , the sound of desultory gunfire . A woman began having hysterics in a near-by room , and a man 's voice started to comfort her . I decided to go out , and then thought better of it , as all the stairways and corridors were darkened , and I might easily hurt myself trying to leave the old-fashioned rambling building . After a while there were the metallic screeches and crashes of bombs falling , more gunfire , and the clang of fire engines and ambulances in the distance . The babel of sounds went on for an hour or so , and began dying away at about one in the morning , when I attempted sleep . The next day the newspapers informed me that England hadfinally won an important victory over the aerial invaders . Adaring British officer had gone up , had circled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A second zeppelin had escaped ; butwith the aviator 's feat as an example , England henceforth wouldbe safe . I took a bus into London soon after , and discovered thatat five or six places along the route windows were smashed overwide areas , walls toppled , and there were smoking and gutteringruins  --  about which the papers , busy keeping England in optimisticmood , said nothing . But from then on I realized that the remotepeace of England , still uninvaded behind the bulwarkof the fleet and the barrier of the narrow seas , was largely a sham . I realized it so much that I now began to feel as I had feltnearly two years before , that my real business in life was toenlist in the British army , since I had come again to live in England . I felt this so strongly that I had a further interview with Aldington on the subject . I pointed out to him that I hadP241now lost any belief that I might have once cherished that the Allies were altogether in the right , and that the Germans were ; altogether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Dardanelles , Jutland , and the Russian collapse , that the Allies could win . Nevertheless , here I was in London , engaged to an Englishwoman , and it seemed to me that my duty was to go . Aldington , who was now in khaki  --  he came up to London occasionally from an officers ' training camp in Kent  --  bluntly told me that my duty was nothing of the sort . On the other hand , inasmuch as I had some good work which was not destructive , but creative , to do , I ought to stay out as long as possible . I was impressed by what he said . Nevertheless my conscience smote me sorely . Since I had come over expressly to marry Daisy , and since Daisy expected me to marry her , it seemed to me that I ought , at the least , to make some attempt to leave her provided for in case I did go into the War . Inasmuch as my present income lapsed after my death , I decided to apply for a life insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen to this before leaving America , I might have found it comparatively easy to accomplish ; but the doctors who now examined me pronouncedme small-chested and underweight , and the life insurance company finally quoted me a policy at a premium which was totally prohibitive in my present circumstances . I was obliged , too , to let this effort lapse . Apparently my best chance of doing anything for Daisy would be to do nothing , to follow Aldington 's advice and stay well out of khaki , so long as the War lasted and America remained neutral . But I could not help feeling that I was thereby being forced to act as a coward , against my own inclinations . On July 5 , a month after my arrival , Daisy and I were quietly married at the register office in Croydon . Her final divorce had been granted about ten days after my arrival . After that the chief reason for our delay was to stifle gossip  --  about which she seemed abnormally sensitive  --  and to ascertain whether it would not be in some way possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Daisy was exceedingly anxious to be married in a church ; I tried to humor her , but soon found that it was impossible to discover any clergyman of the Established Church who would remarry divorced persons . True , the Archbishopof Canterbury and the Bishop of London sometimes , in exceptional cases , issued special licenses permitting divorced per sons to remarry . But the fee for this was fifty pounds . Since I knew nothing special about our circumstances , and since I did not have fifty pounds to throw away , I made no further effort towards a special license , and the ceremony accordingly was not performed in any church , or by any minister . The day of our wedding we were forced to stop in London , in a packed and noisy hotel , to obtain special police permits and identity books enabling us to pursue our wedding trip as far as the Cornish coast . The following day found us in Falmouth , where I had landed a month before , and where , but for certain grim reminders of the German submarine campaign strewn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the swirlingcurrents of the War . After two weeks we returned to London , but soon after the first of August took the children to Ramsgate , where we boarded very cheaply in a house kept by an older relative of Daisy , and there stayed till the beginning of September . My chief recollection of Ramsgate , apart from the combinationit afforded of middle-class trippers and boarders and magnificent Channel sunsets , was of the great hotels that stood on the chalk cliffs , now become military hospitals and crowded with the wreckage of war : the legless , armless , faceless , blinded , shattered men who had once been the flower of England . I also recall a zeppelin raid  --  far more violent than the one I had alreadygone through in London  --  during which guns barked unceasingly , the zeppelin itself was plainly visible from our windows , and both Daisy 's relative and the children showed strong signs of panic . When I returned to London the battle of the Somme was raging , and all England was resounding with stories of the exploitsof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had secretly invented , which she had unloosed on the unpreparedGermans , and which had completely taken them by surprise  --  orso the newspapers said . All that I actually saw of the battle of the Somme was that , every day now in London , great trains full of wounded soldiers were being discharged at Charing Cross Station for distribution to various hospitals . As the ambulancesbearing these war wrecks emerged from the station , women would gather by the gates and throw roses into each ambulance as it passed slowly by . I wondered what use these flowers couldP243he , or what they could mean , to the pitiful broken shells of humanity that lay within . The only literary society I now had was that of H. D. and of Aldington . Aldington was not often available , being at his officers ' training camp most of the time , in preparation for going overseas . H. D. was , most of the time , too distraught by the War and by the prospect of losing Aldington to provide good company . She had introduced me , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before as meeting , casually , at the imagist dinner in 1914 . Somehow , after our first conversation , I discovered a bond of sympathy between Cournos and myself . This exRussianJew , four years older than I , with his long , lean , melancholyface , wearing an expression equally compounded of aestheticyearning and of Mephistophelian irony , fascinated me no less with his knowledge of Russian life and literature , which I had been recently absorbing in huge doses , than with his smoldering Hebraic mysticism , his air of perpetual exile , and his queer combinationof active mentality and of fatalistic resignation . I found in Cournos a man of many careers , who had registered a splendidand unworldly failure in them all . He was just now embarkingon the most ambitious of all by becoming , at thirty-four , a novelist . I also found in him a splendid talker and listener . He soon became imbued with my two leading and favorite ideas : the idea that the great creative artist is less the possessor and shaper of his material than himself possessed and shaped by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ War lay less in its being fought than in its being fought with machines rather than with men . For my part , I took from Cournos the idea , derived through Heine , that the " gods " were still waiting in exile , ready to come back to man , together with its corollary that it was only through the great myth that the artist could fully describe human life and so state the salvation of humanity . Both these ideas presented a strange blend of animal paganism and of otherworldly Christianity ; and both were characteristic of Cournos , a man in whose character lay equally blended the pagan satyr and the Hebraic messiah . Cournos afforded a strange contrast to Amy Lowell , who had been my chief friend in Boston . He was as much the unworldly , unsuccessful Jew as Miss Lowell had been the worldly ,  | successful Yankee ; of the two , I began to feel that I preferred Cournos . I saw a great deal of him that sunnier and winter ; but soon after Kerensky 's Revolution of March , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to Petrograd . I did not see him again till a year had gone by  --  a year which brought the collapse of Russia and the Bolshevik Revolution , all of which he witnessed , and which he has spoken of in his autobiography . After his return he introduced me to D. H. Lawrence , who , after a long and bitter struggle with the British authorities , had been forced to quit his seaside cottage in Cornwall , and to come up , with his German wife , to London . Lawrence interested me almost equally with his fierce , feverishintensity of spirit combined with marked physical frailty , and with his bitter and outspoken hatred of his own country . England , he felt and declared , was already doomed and hopeless . He only wanted to go away somewhere , where with a few congenialspirits he could live and work in peace  --  anywhere , so long as he never again saw England . I was moved by the passionate intensity with which Lawrence proclaimed these sentiments , no less than by the grain of appalling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for England , I thought , that had finally led Lawrenceto condemn her : his love for the England of Chaucer and Shakespeare and Milton and Cobbett and Blake , the England that had long ossified into Victorian hypocrisy , imperialistic greed , industrial exploitation , and economic squalor , under Queen Victoria , Gladstone , and Disraeli . England was probably damned and doomed , even as Lawrence had said  --  and though , even yet , the War might be won , it would probably be too late . That was the tragedy not only of England , but also of D. H. Lawrence , I thought , as I saw his figure , spare , gnarled , peasantlike , with its fiery beard and intense vitality , disappearing like a ghost into the night-darkened streets of London , swathed in December fog . I also met , soon after my return to England , the mysterious T. S. Eliot of whom I had already heard through Harriet Monroeand Conrad Aiken . He struck me then , and has often seemed to me since , as a person who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and left them altogether behind . There was nothing in either his speech , his dress , or his demeanor that proclaimed the former middle-westerner . He seemed rather like one of those cloistered students of the Middle Ages who onceP245roved Europe from monastery to monastery , copying old manuscripts , and belonging to no paticular country . In appearance , with his pale ascetic face , his correct manners , his blend of deliberatereserve and intellectual arrogance , he resembled what the youthful Dante must have looked like  --  and his chief bent , I soon discovered , was to be a poet-scholar , an intelligence that was more critical than creative . Ben Jonson he seemed to think equally as great as Shakespeare ; Dryden he frankly preferred to Milton ; and among the moderns , he tended to rate Pound far above Yeats . The fact that Pound and I did not see each other , as well as my own feeling that Eliot had only succeeded in uprootinghimself even more completely than myself , tended to make me avoid his society . In the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more with reading . My mind had by no means arrived at the point where it was incapable of assimilating new influences in literature and in thought ; on the contrary , I had , as I knew , developed more rapidly mentally in the last three years than in the seven previous ones . I had rushed headlong via English romanticism and French symbolism into modernity without weighing the alternatives or counting the steps on the way . The particular kind of aesthetic modernity that I had affected in Irradiations and the " symphonies " had not been without a philosophic background , but the background had been Chinese , rather than European . Behind the " symphonies " lay the quietism , the gospel of inaction and submission of Lao-tse , and also of Buddhism , with its creed hidden in nature even more effectually than the gospel Wordsworth had found there . But , after all , I was not a Chinese but a west European , on both sides of my ancestry . European culture was now facing the deadliest crisis it had ever known , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall with it . Was there something in European culture I had missed ? I set myself the task of finding out . A careful reading of D. H. Lawrence , which I undertook almost immediately after my return , led me to Thomas Hardy . I had previously read only some of Hardy 's prose works , and had regarded him chiefly as a contemporary and rival of Meredith , in the shift from Victorian idealism to modern realism in novel writing . Now I went through Hardy 's poems , beginning with The Dynasts , which I read with increasing amazement and admiration just at the time when the Somme advance began to collapse , in the late fall of 1916 . I began to realize that Hardy 's admirers in England had understated , rather than overstated , his genius . Tolstoy , before him , had used this theme of the Napoleonic Wars ; but Tolstoy had pitted against Napoleon the Russian peasant , had made Napoleon a vain ignoramus and the Russian peasant a man of God . To Hardy 's immense detachment and to Hardy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and miserable . Napoleon , Nelson , the Russian peasant , the leaders of the Spanish uprising , the English people themselves , all were but victims of circumstances . Nothing remained but the spirit of irony and of pity and the awful , impersonal , inhuman immensity of God . This Wessex recluse , this last of the Victorians , had , in his neutraltonedverses , with their homespun Saxon strength of phrase , matched Sophocles , and spoken the doom not of Athens , but of western man . This , it seemed to me as I read him , was the only line of development that now lay open to the European consciousness : a disabused patience , a stoic resignation to circumstances , a pessimism that perpetually faced the alternative that " if a better may be , it demands a full look at the worst , " an insight that could match the puny efforts of man 's individual will with the awful , impersonal will that moved through history . My task , I now felt , was to preserve in my poetry that freedom in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vividly colored background of natural and dramatic description , but gradually to infuse it with a sympathy for human life that would bring it closer to Hardy 's . To describe life through nature became now my aim . The question was , How much must I sacrifice to achieve it ? I saw clearly that , at any rate , I must sacrificethe personal pronoun , which had dominated the writing of Irradiations and of the " symphonies . " No longer could I describe my own private experiences , but only experience in general . And , though I could still use natural objects as symbols to describeexperience , the experience described must be something not peculiar to myself . Some time early in October , exactly three years from the day that Daisy and I had first come together , I took the typescript of the love poems I had written her , completed before leaving the United States , and shipped them off to Houghton Mifflin , underP247the title , first chosen by me in opposition to Dante 's Divina Gonimnedia , of Love 's Tragedy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this manuscript for three years . The first book , The Aster Flower , had been written in the October of 1913 , when I was still the novice of Irradiations and the " Sea Symphony . " The second , Fruits of Flame , had come during the brief interlude of our happiness together the following spring and summer : it was exactly contemporaneous with the " Green , " the " Golden " and the " White Symphonies . " The third , The Empty Days , had been written in Galveston , Texas , and in Little Rock , Arkansas , during the winter of 1914-155 , on my trip south . Dreams in the Night had come to me in Boston the following spring ; and the last , Towards the Darkness , during the winter of 1915-16 , in Boston . I believed that this book , for all its possible abuse of the personal pronoun , all its sometimes hectic overemotionalism , would serve as an excellent introduction and earnest of the kind of poetry to which I now proposed to devote myself . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ analogy of mood and object , the same symphonic development , the same contrast of conflicting mood and aspect , that my " symphonies " had already employed , on a subject of wider human interest and import . I saw no reason why , if the " symphonies " had been published , it could not also be published . Meanwhile , from her summer home in Dublin , Miss Lowell had continued to write me , telling me in each letter how the movement was catching on , how the second imagist anthology was keeping up with the first , and how remarkably well she thought of my newly produced Goblins and Pagodas . She was also insistent that , in view of the situation , I should return to America . I had , however , decided to wait on in England , having long ago concluded that the growth of interest in the movement meant largely , in this case , the growth of interest in Amy Lowell . I did not begrudge her her fame , nor the way in which she was achieving it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my friendly attitude to Alfred Kreymborg , and to his Others group . She was so afraid that they might take sales away from the imagists , as to forbid me even the remotest show of friendliness in their direction . I thought it best to keep the ocean between us , for a time at least , and to go my own way independently .   I saw now not the least reason why Houghton Mifflin , whether I was linked with her or not , should look unfavorably on the new manuscript I was sending them . I had already one ardent admirer of my talent in the firm , in the person of Linscott ; and Ferris Greenslet , the head of it , had spoken publicly in favor of my poetry , in the columns of the Egoist . Nor did I suppose that Miss Lowell would , under any circumstances , interferein the course of my destiny . She was not even published by Houghton Mifflin now , I reflected , but by Macmillan . WhateverI sent them would be judged as an independent work , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manuscript and was still awaiting an answer when , at the close of October , Miss Lowell sent me a copy of her second volume , Men , Women and Ghosts . The book stirred me , in spite of the fact that its author and I had drifted apart , to wildest enthusiasm . Here , set out with supreme narrativeand dramatic skill , were all those gorgeously decorated , psychologically keen narratives of human destiny that I had heard her read as they were written during the past two years : " Patterns , " " A Roxbury Garden , " " The Cross Roads , " " Malmaison , " " The Hammers . " Here was a poetry different altogetherfrom Masters 's frontier realism , Frost 's bucolic humor , Lindsay 's cosmic evangelicism , Sandburg 's blend of American swagger and Scandinavian mysticism . It was a poetry rich , tragic , sumptuous , aristocratic , romantic , vivid and proud . I immediately wrote an enthusiastic letter , saying that the book was a masterpiece , and promising a review for the Egoist  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On November 21 I received a cablegram requesting that the review be sent immediately to Boston . Accordingly , a day or so later , I sent it , only requesting that it should not appear in Braithwaite 's paper  --  for I had heard , before leaving Boston , ugly rumors to the effect that she was now financing Braithwaite ; and I wished anything I wrote , either favorably or unfavorably , about her should appear in some paper independent of her influence . The review did not appear , and the next news I received was of such a startling character as to cause me to regret that it had ever been sent . On the seventh of December I received a letter from Ada Russell , written a day before the cablegram had been sent . In itP249she informed me that Amy had been seriously ill with neuralgia.111 ( 1 indigestion , followed by jaundice and insomnia . She was unable to wt lie , but was very sorry that Greenslet had rejectedthe poems I had scat to Houghton Mifflin . He had been unable to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her and asked her advice . She had said that though she did not like them so well as the others I had already published , she thought they would sell better . She was sorry if she had said anything to lead them to reject these poems . The blow of this letter , coming before Houghton Mifflin had even written , or had sent back the manuscript , was decisive . Up to then I had played about with the idea of returning to America , possibly in the next spring , if the War went on . Daisy would not , I felt , object , as she was now legally an American ; and the children , being under age , would naturally accompany us . I might easily settle in Boston , and resume there my literary career . But now that avenue of escape was cut off , drastically and effectually . What could I do in Boston , or anywhere else , if the only publishing house that had been favorable to my work referredprivately everything I wrote to Amy Lowell ? And what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had gone away and married sway her judgment ? I immediately sat down and wrote Amy a letter of which I give some paragraphs , without comment : You and I have been friends now for over three years . If you will review in your mind that period , you will perhaps find that not many of your friends have done more for you than I. I have not always seen eye to eye with you on some points ; but I have never doubted your ability as a poet , and time after time I have defended you , not only in public , but in private . I have never let an opportunity slip to declare my faith in you and in your future . I say proudly and confidently that I have done my utmost to stand by you ; and , had I the power to do more , more would have been done . Not only is this true , but it is also true that you are indebted to me for certain suggestions and criticisms of poetry which I have given you from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acknowledged . Now let us see what bearing all this has on the manuscript I sent to Greenslet . That manuscript was the product of three years ' hard labor . I had spared no pains to make it perfect . So perfect did I consider it , that I hesitated about letting it go ( it is only with my bestp250works that I feel like this ) . Linscott was aware of its existence , wrote and asked me to let him sec it ; and through him it fell into Greenslet 's hands . Greenslet , being apparently unable to make up his mind , showed it to you ; and it was your opinion that turned the scale . You did not think all of it in my best manner . Even if you do not agree with me , even if you think that collectionthe worst I have written , I must ask you what do you mean by writing me as you did some time ago , and offering to act as my agent in America ; and then publicly disparaging what I consider to be my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or a friend ? Friendship is a question of give-and-take ; and in my friendship with you , I have given what I have taken . If you have not enough confidence in me , as a better poet than  --  or  --  ,  --  if you do not think it better worth Greenslet 's while to publish me than these , then it is time we parted company . I should deeply regret having to lose a friend ; but half-afriendis worse than none . Unless you can defend my work in the same spirit with which you defended Mrs. Untermeyer 's or Sandburg 's or any of your friends , I have no alternative but to withdraw . The manuscript of Love 's Tragedy finally did arrive ; having been posted on November 11 , but delayed by the uncertainty of mails in those wartime days , and by the added delay of having to pass through the British censorship . I spent the month of Decembercontemplating my first rejection at the hands of a publisher since my writing of Irradiations in the spring of 1913 . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Lowell , which , despite the admiration I still felt for her poetry , I could not overcome . Without asking my consent , without thinking of the damage it might do me , her hand had been the first to deal this blow and to destroy the footing I had painfully established in America . Now I no longer had a publisher there , and I must wait and wait till one came my way in England . And to make things worse , Ada Russell 's letter apprising me of Amy 's action , and venturing to excuse it on the grounds of illness , had come just after I received a cable begging me to send her a copy of an extremely laudatory review , which the reception of her Men , Women and Ghosts had already moved me to write . There was only one thing to do , and that was to stifle my feelings and face the situation . Since Houghton Mifflin would no longer publish my work , since Miss Lowell chose to destroy my standing with the publishers whom she had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indefinitely ; butp251somehow I would get Love 's Tragedy published in England . Whether she were right or wrong about this book 's being inferior to the others , I knew I must obtain a publisher for it . But I now definitely decided , despite all promptings to return , to stick out the War in England . I could , and must , stand on my own feet henceforward , and definitely take the responsibility for my own life and writings . I knew now that Amy Lowell and I could never again be friends on the old footing . The rejection of my manuscriptat her hands had been the equivalent of a stab in the back ; I could never overlook that fact . Nevertheless , for the sake of our friendship in the past , I would do my best , henceforward , to forgive her and to bear with her  --  but I resolutely rejected the offer she soon made , after her reception of the letter I have just quoted , to bring out the book at her own expense . While waiting for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems . The theme , however painful , was now inescapable , and I hoped to handle it in a spirit of irony and pity not unakin to that of Thomas Hardy . Meanwhile , I must wait . After all , I was only thirty , and had years before me in which I could work out my destiny . Miss Lowell had been already forty when she began , and Robinson had been forty-six before he obtainedany but the smallest of audiences . If only the War would some day end , if only God would give me strength , I could work and work  --  and wait.  | NINETEEN-SEVENTEEN came and went , but brought no change to my situation . The winter of 1916-17 was an intensely cold and bleak one , and by the end of February , Daisy sickened with the first illness she had known since our marriage , falling victim to the prevailing influenza and remaining in bed for two weeks . Scarcely had she recovered when her daughter fell ill of the same complaint , suffering from an even worse case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the point of quitting us to go into the making of munitions , I judged it best to give my wife a brief holiday . So a little before Easter I sent her and the children off to Brighton , while I myself took a room in a London hotel , and tried to think . It was there that I had the news that America had gone into the War . The news changed little or nothing in my situation . I had long ago decided that it was not my business to rush into uniform to be maimed or killed . I ought to stay out , write poetry , try to help culture and humanity to survive this crisis in their affairs . To this decision I had been helped by Aldington , by my own powers of reflection , even by Daisy 's natural but unreasoned demand that I should stay out , and thus let my money continue to support her and the children . The fact of America 's belated entry could not change my unalterable conviction that the War was senseless madness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although it seemed to me now that America was enteringtoo late to do Europe or the Allies any real good , I realized that Woodrow Wilson had finally been driven into the impossible situation which I had already envisaged for him a year ago when I wrote my poem on Lincoln . I was glad now that America did not give way to sentimental hysteria , but mobilized for war in a practical matter-of-fact spirit . She was not , for example , going to rely on volunteers to help her . Conscription would exist from the moment she declared hostilities . I put down my name at the American consulate in the list of Americans who were holding themselves ready for service atp253any time if ( ailed upon , stated that the only obstacle to my joiningthe American al my was the fact that I had a wife and two stepchildren dependent on my support , and dismissed the future front my mind . If the authorities wanted me they would call upon mc , in due course . 1 had no feelings one way or the other . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I knew the War would not end that year , though several of the English papers were still pathetically predicting Germany 's collapse . Rumania was out , Serbia was out , Russia was flickering . The Allies could do nothing in the west against Hindenburg 's castirondefenses . In England , Asquith was forced from public office ; and Lloyd George , more boastful and braggart than ever , together with his coalition of Liberals and Conservatives , was put in . Nothing could happen before the late spring , now that the Somme had proved itself a failure . And for my part , I suspected that the United States would be both slow and ineffectual in getting under way , having in my mind a vivid memory of the graft , the inefficiency , the sentimental hysteria , and the corrupt administration that had marked and shamed my country during the Spanish-American War . Alone now in London , with Cournos preparing to go to Russia , Aldington already in uniform and ready to be called upon to go overseas at any moment , Flint effectually buried in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first days of the War . Thirty-two months had gone by since then , since those August days of 1914 ; and now America had been drawn in , probably too late . My mind went back to an early summer day of that year 1914 when , in the company of Edward Thomas , I had gone on an excursion out of London to Hampton Court Palace and to . Bushey Park . We had lain together in the grass , under the great horse chestnuts , while I talked of free verse and imagism , and Thomas spoke of his love of the English countryside , and of W. H. Hudson . He had reflectively chewed on a grass-blade , while we sat and looked at the semitame park deer browsing in the distance , and we had both wondered what it felt like to be not a man , but an animal , and whether Walt Whitman was right in saying that the animals were more contentedthan man , because they did not groan or fret over their condition . Now Thomas was already dead ; he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speak to him again . Historyp254had shoveled him into a grave iii France . The beautiful , sensitivepoems he had written in the last months of his life were only now coming out , too late to recall him . I too probably would soon have to submit to the same fate . The machinery of the War was relentlessly crushing out every vestige of humanity , as the British tanks had rolled over the German trenches ; as the U-boats , now reaping their worst harvest , were torpedoing Allies and neutrals , soldiers and civilians alike on the high seas ; as the airplanes were bombing not only the trenches , but civilians . It was useless to invoke , as the conscientiousobjectors were doing , Christianity against the continuance of the struggle . The churches had raised no protest , had even blessed this orgy of destruction . It was useless , too , to follow Henry Ford , and to charter a ship to try and bring peace to ravaged Europe . The dragon 's teeth of battle were already too deeply sown ; newer and newer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ civilization went the way of ancient Rome , and the barbarian , the savage succeeded to the wreckage . The earth was entering a new dark age , and the Renaissance was at an end . What did the individual matter after all ? Soon after Easter , with the news that America had joined the Allies fresh in my mind , I went again to Hampton Court , which I had not revisited since that June day that Edward Thomas and I had been there . I was now alone . The crocuses were already out , in all their fresh bravery of gold , under the chill and leaden April sky , but no one looked much at them . The shrunken crowd of Easter holiday seekers , middle-aged men , middle-class mothers , Canadian or Australian soldiers on leave with their girls , here and there a child , were indifferent to everythingexcept a scouting airplane that kept maneuvering up and down the Thames . I lay still and communed with my thoughts . America had come in . But Europe , the Europe I had known , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as it had been . It seemed to me then that my only release lay in the prospect of joining such men as Edward Thomas and seeking a grave in France . The individual , whatever his philosophy , no longer counted . Nor did Christianity , that unique gift of west-European civilization to the world , count any longer . Only the machine counted , and financial greed , and nationalist hysteria coiningp255profit out of slaughter , and wreckage and destruction . I must accept , as Thomas had accepted , my death : Better to die now with the golden lightOf Europe swiftly fadingFrom the summit of that mountain or this cloud ; Better unconsciously to restIn the dark bosom of the earthFeeling each night the influence of the stars Wheeling through seasons their unchanging path ; Feeling the earth heaped close and hugging me To deeper , denser darkness ; While , day and night , the worldPursues its destiny to which war and peace Are as the smoke that high winds blow away . I felt now as one already dedicated to death , and therefore prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ European culture could not survive the War , there was all the more reason why , in its passing , I should be takenOut of the ring of light that glimmers on human faces , Anxiously watching and praying for me . I set forth free from them , To the infinite stir and the murmur of night on the waters . London , as I now saw , under its new lighting restrictions was at least enormously and fantastically beautiful while the spring days slowly lengthened to summer . Every street lamp had been shaded , so that it cast only a faint cone of light down on the pavement . And the night with all its magic of moonlight , starlight , river mist , sailing or floating cloud , reassumed its dominion , once threatened by electric lights , over this formidable ant heap of humanity . Especially in the darkened City , the oldest part of London , did the night bring forth the ghosts . I recalled them later , after the War , when various British soldiers  --  Robert Graves among them  --  told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had actually seen , or thought they had , soldiers who , they knew , had been killed months before , strolling in the streets of half-ruined towns , or sitting at empty cafe tables . It seemed to me now that Shakespeare and Milton and Samuel Johnson , Blake and Dickens and Browning , all the great splendidp256company of the masters of English speech , revisited the city where they had lived , and spoke again to men living in the midst of England 's crisis , with the German submarines sending a million tons of shipping to the bottom every month , and the national government straining every nerve to produce more munitions . In those eerie , uncanny , deserted streets , under the faint cones of grayish light cast on the pavement and bordered with darkness , I half expected to see figures emerging and passing , dressed in the costume of other days . Had they been seen , I do not think that I would have been astonished . In July , before the middle of the month , came a visitation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when twenty of the new bomb-carrying Gothas flew over in broad sunlight and , finding London 's air defenses utterly unprepared , spread havoc in a wide area from Smithfield Market to London Bridge . I saw the fighting in the distance , took train to London soon after , walked through the streets around Cheapside which lay ankledeepin shattered glass , knew that henceforward London was not safe , and could not be made safe , from such airplane attacks launched unexpectedly . Nor was it , as the sequel proved . The harvest moon of that year  --  come after Daisy and I had prolonged a holiday scheduled to last four weeks into six , because it kept us remote from London  --  willnever be wiped from my memory entirely . Every night for a week the Gothas came over , and every night for a week there was the bang of the maroons warning London to take cover , the roar of the guns , the crash of bombs , machine guns rattling in the air between attackers and defenders , on and on for hours , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As my wife 's mother lay at the time in a London hospital , suffering from an incurable illness , my business carried me in and out of the city a good deal , with the result that I saw the underground stations packed with weary humanity , the streets filled with scurrying people , the railway stations empty and darkened . And on one night at least , I traveled from London to my suburb on a train that progressed in total darkness . For many years , as a consequence , until long after the War , my favorite forms of nightmarewere of being pursued by airplanes , and of being buried alive in a maze of underground tunnels . As the year came to an end I realized , looking back on it ,  |p257that  the only period of it I had really enjoyed had been the six weeks ' holiday I had spent that summer . We had chosen for our holiday , Daisy and I and the children , a spot on the Cornish coast which at that time was within easy access of much wild @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wind-swept rounded headlands of serpentine and granite reaching out into the crash and gurgle of the Atlantic breakers , long moors stretchinginland ablaze with yellow gorse and purple heather , sleepy untroubled villages nestling about their granite churches in the tree-shaded hollows , with crimson fuchsias aflame at the doors of their whitewashed cottages . This land of Lyonesse , of Arthurian fable and brooding mystery , of abandoned tin mines and fishing ports and waste places , seemed not only remote from the War , but indifferent to it . The Cornish people themselves , their smoldering Celticism aflame , cared little for England . One heard everywhere tales of their resistance to the conscription act , of lighthouse keepers who had been discovered helping the German submarines , of uninhabitedislands where refueling bases for these submarines had been discovered , of secret spies and of lights seen on distant headlands . And I myself saw , in water-fashioned caves along the coast , wreckage which had been washed ashore from torpedoed ships and which inhabitants had carefully hidden and salvaged . In one lonely bay there was even a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had been promptly looted of much of its cargo . The spell which the wild scenery and life of Cornwall laid upon me was so powerful that under it I soon conceived of a way whereby I could write poems that had nothing more to do with the War . Here man was still pitted against the elements , sea , earth , air , fire , winning a scant sustenance from each ; here the mechanical age that now openly ruled the great metropolitan areas of London and the Midlands had not yet conquered man 's independence , his smoldering paganism , his integral savagery . I promptly schemed out a new book , to be called , provisionally , Elements , and consisting equally of descriptive and narrative pieces , somewhat on the lines of Miss Lowell 's own volumes , to be divided into four parts : " Sea , " " Earth , " " Air , " " Fire . " The first would deal with man 's restless , adventurous , roving explorationsof the unknown , no less than with the elemental mystery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ habitations were surrounded ; the second with sowing and plowing and reaping , home building and trade , the spring and the harvest ; the third with the ever-repeated and ever-unsatisfied longings and hankeringsafter the divine ; the last with the inner fire of sex and of life , that drove him forward relentlessly . The scheme was to be the most ambitious on which I had yet embarked . It would contain , perhaps , a hundred poems , and though it might not ever be printed , it would be my swan song in case I had to go into the War . I worked on it all that summer and autumn , putting into it all that I had , all my powers of natural description , and all my loneliness and bitterness and frustration as a man . The manuscript of Elements is now lost , and the poems that it once contained have been for so long vanished and scattered that I could not , even if I would , recall them to memory . One version  --  probably incomplete  --  was sent to America as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prize contest which was undoubtedly a fraudulent one . It was only recovered with difficulty from the man who ran the contest . A second version , complete this time , after vainly traveling for years through the hands of various publishers , was given in 1929 to a friend in New York City who had done me some kindness , and he may still have it . Various of the poems that made up this book have appeared since then , in different publications . One of the earliest written , " The Black Rock , " composed in Cornwall in the summer of 1917 and dedicated to Thomas Hardy , appeared later as the title poem of my book published in 1928 . Two others , " Moonlight " and " Dawn , " appeared in the last anthology of the imagists , in 1917 , where they aroused the admiration of Amy Lowell but were ignored by the public in favor of the far more popular " Lincoln . " Still another , entitled " Earth , " has occasionally been reprinted since the Yale Review printed it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As for the rest of those hundred poems , they have all vanished ; and the ca ' ; es and lone shores of Cornwall , the remote coppices and uplands of the Kentish Downs that saw their birth , may , for aught I know , be recalling them still , to other wayfarers . I am content that it should be so , just as I am content that the single faded and tattered typescript that I still possess , and which is all I have to show for the war poems on which I laboredp259for three years , but which I made little effort to have published , should remain unread . As a poet , I realize that I have been , and must remain , for my Iifetime , an anachronism . This age , though it has produced re poets , can not be said to be an age in any way favorable to poetry . The reason is that the reading and enjoyment of poetry can only be carried on by an intelligent and ' a leisured class . It was the intellectuals , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen  --  who appreciated Sophocles and Aeschylus . It was the wits , the scholars , and the courtiers of the Elizabethan age who  --  despite his truckling to the groundlings  --  valued and supported Shakespeare . It was the dandies , the bucks , and the bloods of the Regency who gave to Byron his European reputation . And if any poet is to survive our day it will be because he too appeals finally to a well-bred , wellfed , leisured minority who have the time to read and the taste to enjoy his art . In an age such as this , when the democratic standard of taste admits as literature anything from mystery thrillers to the performances of highly publicized novelists , the poet has no place . That is because the poet is a maker , a creator , a transmitter of raw fact into the different dimension of symbol and metaphor , myth and parable . Poetry has survived ; but those who still read it , who know anything at all about it , who are interested in it still , are a special @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and , like these , their tastes are equally varied and unpredictable . So 1917 merged into 1918 , and I had nothing more to show for another year gone by than this : that towards the close of the year I had gone to a London publisher and had obtained immediateacceptance for Love 's Tragedy , under its new title of The Tree of Life . So the last of the volumes which had marked the full flowering , in all its vividness , of my fresh-blown talent , duly appeared in London in the late summer of 1918 , sometime after the moment when Ludendorff , gambling for a last throw , thrust his armies through Saint-Quentin to Amiens . The book was scarcely reviewed at all , and most of the reviewers treated it sneeringly . It is still in print as I write , but unread . The final epilogue to this period was spoken by the appearance , in the same summer of 1918 , of Japanese Prints , which Brown , in Boston , had now held for two years . For my part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ performances of the past ,  |p26o  and had emerged into another period of development marked by Elements and the war poems : a period which seemed to me to 1x  --  both more heroic , more epical in outline , and more desperately serious in import . Alone and unguided except by my own instinct , I was driving fast and far towards the future . The American authorities , though I frequently saw them , made no move in my direction . I was free to go , without wearinguniform , wherever I liked , without taking up any other work than the writing of poetry . I was striving to round out my career as I best might , for I had now no belief that the War would speedily end , and I felt that sooner or later I must be sucked into it . On the day I should be compelled to put on uniform , I decided to give up all writing . Elements and the war poems , taken together , had finally defined my attitude : a stoic paganism , an acceptance of nature , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and less sentimental than that of Wordsworth , and which was remote alike from the attitude of the organized churches and from that of nineteenth-century laissezfaireliberalism  --  both showing their worst fruits , just then , in the War . The production of Miss Lowell 's Tendencies in Modern American Poetry in the fall of 1917 had in America , at least , markedly improved my own poetic position ; and had I been in my own country I might have profited by it . I was now cut off from the United States by three thousand miles of empty ocean , with no prospect for return . Indeed , the rising cost of living in England , thanks to the War , made my economic position more and more precarious . With a wife and two growing young people to support , I now found it not easy to make both ends meet . For a time , Linscott very generously and self-sacrificingly acted as my literary agent , and was instrumental in getting my work placed in various magazines . The aid he gave was frequently invaluable . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much manuscripton my hands that I decided not , under any circumstances , to write any more poetry . The mood I had created in Irradiations and the " symphonies " was not to be recaptured ; so , having fairly drained myself of new emotions in the war poems and in Elements , and all for no result , I quitted the field . As early as 1913 the idea had come to me that I might supplement my unsatisfactory career as poet by functioning asp261an alt critic . My spasmodic attempts to make a painter of myself , my own cagey interest in all the visual arts , had told me that I ought . to try and make some further use of this faculty rather than transcribe it all into imagistic poetry . Unlike Miss Lowell , I did not feel disposed to embark on the difficult field of literary criticism ; but I thought I knew enough about painters and painting to write fairly well about them . In the spring of 1913 I planned an extensive book on the impressionist and **25;4767;TOOLONG , the first comprehensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pissarro , Cezanne , Gauguin , Van Gogh , Renoir , Degas , Picasso , and the cubists were to be all discussed and evaluated in its pages . The coming of my first important literary contacts , through Pound and his imagists , the development of the " symphonies , " banished , temporarily , all such thoughts from my mind . Now it occurred to me that though I could not be given the time to finish so ambitious and so comprehensivea task , I might at any rate be able , before going into the War , to write a short study of at least one artist of this period . I deliberately chose Paul Gauguin , less discussed as a painter than Cezanne , less important as a man than Van Gogh , because in him I sensed something akin to my own exile , as well as somethingclose to my own smoldering revolt and disgust with **29;4794;TOOLONG civilization . Gauguin had preferred savagery , as Rousseau had and Thoreau had ; and I felt now , facing the reality of tanks and submarines and poison gas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . So I decided , early in that year of 1918 , to write a book on Gauguin  --  only to discover that Michael Sadleir had long entertained the same notion , and had once been on the point of fulfilling it . I proposed therefore a collaboration , but by this time Sadleir had already given up his position at his publishing office for a more important one in England 's newly established Food Ministry , where he was so overworked and harried that he was utterly unable to find time to write anything . I decided to write the book on my own , hoping that Sadleir would be able to go over the manuscript later on and revise it . All that summer of 1918 , accordingly , while the supreme madness of the war fever burnt itself out among all the nations of the earth , I spent my hours in communing with Paul Gauguin amid the tropic solitudes of his distant and peaceable South Seap262Eden of Tahiti  --  a spot of the world 's surface I have never visited , though I envied Gauguin his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to go there . The book which resulted , published in 1921 , presented at best a strongly idealized picture of a man whose life by any standard of judgment was spent in violent oscillation between the rival appeals of decadent European culture and of remote , unspoiltsavagery . I was forced to admit , as I studied Gauguin more closely , that his character was neither integral nor profound . There was about the man something vulgar : the sensation seeker , the careerist , the unabashed egotist were oddly mixed in him with the mystical and fatalistic pagan . He was less an organic whole at bottom than his contemporary , Lafcadio Hearn , who also had fled from the commercial horrors of the West , to a semirealrefuge in remote Japan . But at any rate , I was grateful to Gauguinfor enabling me to state my own problem : either a civilizationalready decadent or a deliberate return to primitivism ; either mankind submitting to the anonymous slavery imposed upon it by modern machine-age technique , or mankind seeking again , where it lay hidden in primitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ age . I was grateful , too , that my study of Paul Gauguin 's career and development took my mind into fields remote from the War . Now , as I went about London or remained in my suburban home , writing and thinking about him , I felt less disposed to complain at my fate than previously , despite the fact that the world was entering the last desperate stage of the great conflict . I felt that it was my business to stay where I was , to regard my American career as closed , and to concentrate my remaining energies upon England and my new life there . I might make something of it , after all , despite my rebellious Americanism , my individualistic anarchism . There was a good chance that the Gauguin book could be published . The Armistice came at last , and Sadleir , judging perhaps that my attitude towards Gauguin was an immature one , or losing whatever interest he once had in the subject , refused finally to collaborate even to the extent of revising the manuscript or suggesting ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning to publishing , help it as it stood to find a market . So I regretfully laid the finished book aside until the time , soon to ( ( init. , when , thanks to Somerset Maugham 's successful novel , the topic of Gauguin 's life became a literary sensation in America . The War was over , and I , who had not expected to survive it , now looked back on two years not rich in material rewards but crowded with many strange experiences of vicarious suffering and endurance . I had passed through the struggle without getting into uniform , without being jailed as a conscientious objector , without making any further progress in my career as one of the most discussed " new poets " in America . There the new poetry still held the stage ; and people like Amy Lowell , Carl Sandburg , and Vachel Lindsay were passing from the status of freaks to that of educational subjects . Young students in colleges and universities were already studying their works , while other young students were already imitating them . Here , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way before the uprush of young war poets , and Sassoon , Graves , Nichols , Blunden , and the tragic Wilfred Owen were having their day . Poetry was still selling , was in fact running into its second phase of interest . The anthology boom was already on its way , and Louis Untermeyer in his " Miscellany " was shortly to revive the imagist anthology notion on a broader basis . I , however , was now out of the current , buried more effectually in England than if I had been , as I once supposed , hidden away in a trench grave in France , and completely preventedfrom taking part in whatever was going on . As regards my own state of mind , I can not do better than quote from a letter I wrote to the devoted Linscott , early in 1919 : I believe that we have now more points in agreement than we ever had before . Certainly , the experience of the last three years has changed me in most ways . I am now getting middle-aged , and conservative . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ return . I still believe that this wretched planet is managed and controlled by some great overwhelming Force  --  what most folk call " God . " But neither you , nor I , nor anyone is able to understand the motives and purposes of that Force , any more than an ant could understand or appreciate a thunderstorm . Our petty minds are too feeble , too limited . We are really only the pawns , the playthings of something beyond our knowledge  --  and yet we like to strut about and think ourselves great , heroic and important . Truly , the irony of life is colossal . I still suspect that there may be such a thing as human progress  --   |p264though  it is so slow , so painful , accomplished at such a price paid by individual for its attainment , that 1 doubt whether it is worth the effort . It is all predestined to happen in any case , if at all . I do not doubt but that the soul is immortal ; but whether this ' applies consciousness or feeling of individuality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The energy we bear in us simply flows back to , ' Source , to be used over and over again . So far as this queer tangle Of hopes and dreams and pains that is life is concerned , I fully expectNirvana .... The complex of energy , of which I made a part , willg0 on working out its destiny . I have written this because you asked me in your letter the ques-t lion whether I feel life to be as rich emotionally now as at 21 ? No , I 0Onot . I was fortunate in keeping young longer than 21 ; but for about three years I have known that my youth is definitely dead . Not only have I lost a good deal of my own intensity of feeling ; but , worse , I have lost much of my faith in mankind . Especially has this been so from the day that America entered the war . Since then , I have seen with increasing clarity and bitterness , that however high our aims , however noble our intentions , something always conspires to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that even though there is progress , the millennium will never arrive , and the last generation of mankind will have just as much evilmin t t0 contend with as we have . Evil is as necessary to our existence , as g  --  0d . Evil is an active principle , creating , destroying , always changingi M. in form . Good is only a conservative principle , unchanging , inactive . Thus it happens that when we will evil , we often accomplish only g  --  0d , and vice versa . Art , then , is the only consolation . Art enables us to express whatw we are ; it states the level to which we attain in every generation . But that art makes us any happier , any better , any more able to attain our desires , is merely an illusion . On the contrary , Art probably only in- Greases our suffering , as you say in your letter . For that reason , artists Ore usually unhappy : and the greater they are , the more unhappy . I PI sure that Dante @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own sufferings are slight . In such a chastened mood , compounded equally of two years of fresh exile and of passive resistance to the great conflict , I bade farewell to the Great War.  | BY the early months of 1919 I had decided to return to America ; but I knew that the return , if it were made , must be made alone . Under my existing circumstances , my resources were inadequate to the task of bringing over both Daisy and her children to my own country . I had discussed the matter with her thoroughly , and had discovered that , while she admitted the force of my argument that the only prospect I had for a future literary career lay in America , she was now adamant in her refusal to leave the children behind . Although her daughter was already sixteen and her son fourteen years of age , she continued to treat them as if they were just emerging from infancy . They , in turn , continued to lavish on her the manifestations of an affection which was barely a stage removed from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their upbringing entirely in her hands , realized that they were now likely , under such control , to become only too docile and inhibited . So I soon saw to it that the girl , who was not clever at ordinary lessons , but who showed a strong disposition to become a painter , should be sent to a small but adequate art school in the neighborhood , while the boy , who was better at general knowledge , went to a preparatory school . As I did this at my own expense , my economic resources were now strained to the vanishing point . Apart from my bad financial position , the only objection I now felt at returning to America was the fact that the United States had celebrated the conclusion of the War by becoming a prohibitionist nation . Not only were the United States now , by the very nature of the case , the richest and most powerful of all nations , but they had set themselves the task of remaining so permanently , by means of a piece of puritanic legislation fosteredby rabidly Protestant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , supposedly , the highest standard of living , paid the highest industrial wages of any nation on earth . The maintenance of this standard  --  mythical as it was  --  weighed more in the minds of her capitalist rulers than the continuance of moral and intellectual liberty . The theory that had made the Prohibition Amendment acceptable was that if prohibition were only put through , all workmen would inevitably save more , work more efficiently , and lead more healthy lives  --  a theory not only false , but cynically ruinous of human dignity and integrity . I was destined , during the next ten years , to hear this theory frequently upheld by Americans , in the intervals between their consumption of shots of bootleg whisky and rankly poisonous gin . It is not my purpose here to discuss in detail the effects of the Prohibition Amendment on the American people . Its effects were already noteworthy and notorious , by the summer of 1920 , in a complete relaxation of the moral fiber , a growing irresponsibility , an increasing selfishness and cynicism among vast numbers of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few years of his life to a detailed study of the subject , and may show how the prohibition issue , skillfully wrapped up in mass propaganda , was successfully put over , only to bring , in its train , such a variety of evils as permanently to weaken the American character . For my part , I only felt , and still feel , that if it is wrong to forbid people by law to read certain books , or to hold radical political views , it is equally wrong to forbid them by law from drinking . All the civilized nations of the world have indulged in alcoholic liquor , in one form or another , for centuries untold . Prohibition in America seemed to me a reversion to barbarism , the choice of a greater evil in preference to a lesser one . If the South , from which I had sprung , could not have been legislated out of the path that had led the southern states to secession and to civil war in 1861 , neither was there , in 1919 , any means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could ever be legislated into temperance , and persuaded to uphold the law at all costs . Meanwhile , it was becoming clear as daylight that Woodrow Wilson was not going to have his own way in Paris . Bit by bit , Clemenceau , backed by Lloyd George , forced him to give way on every issue . Of his original fourteen points which , along with hunger and starvation and continued slaughter , had been chiefly responsible for bringing about the German collapse , nothing now remained . He was finally induced to sign a treaty which dealt with the Germans precisely as the Romans had dealt with the ancient Carthaginians . So the man who had come to Paris to be hailed as a messiah by every war-weary nation on earth , who hadp267hidden through London 's packed and awed streets on a sparkling frosty clay of December sunlight , sitting side by side with the British king  --  so this ratan departed to his own country , already mistrusted by everyone , who , as I , now felt that all of the dead had died in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater mistrust of his own country and to fail there also . On a day late in April , in the midst of a capricious spring that had just brought , overnight , a sudden fall of snow on top of the already budding trees , I suddenly heard that Edward O'Brien was now in London . The news was a surprise to me , to say the least . Some years younger than myself , the spoilt and petted child of his mother , he had seemed to me when I met him in Boston , still largely a boy , a boy who , by his own account , had gone out to various waste places of the earth , such as the Magdalene Islands and Aran , in a Rimbaudlike flight from civilization , but who had kept intact thereby his Irish Celticism , his Catholicism , and his charm . With long , straight black hair , ragged and uncut about his high bullet-shaped forehead , candid blue eyes , and a sensual heavy-lipped mouth below a tiny fluff of straggly mustache , dressed commonly in frayed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ animating his body and brain which had driven him through many more books than I had read , and had kept him alive and alert despite the fact that he had supported his mother by working at the most menial of literary jobs , EdwardO'Brien had seemed to me then to be authentically of the material of which the Irish martyrs are made . I could easily picture him as dying in the Dublin Easter week uprising , along with his favorite heroes , such as Padraic Pearse and Conolly . It seemed to me strange to hear , in the spring of 1919 , that he was again in London , now that the Irish situation was once more flaring up into open civil war between Loyalists and Republicans . I had not suspected him of coming so coolly and so unexpectedly into the very heart of the enemy 's country . I did not , however , question O'Brien as to his motives and plans in coming to England . On the contrary , I welcomed him with delight , and accepted him as a friend . My American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to one , T. S. Eliot , whom I saw very seldom . I was simply pining for some new American society , some breath of the keen , fresh , creative American energy that I had seen playing over the land- scape in 1915 , and which provided such a contrast to the torpor and mental inertia that had again settled over England immediately after the Armistice . O'Brien , with his boyish enthusiasm , his mental curiosity , his roguish lack of respect for the big academic pontiffs of the political and the literary world , seemed to me then an authentic example of my country 's genius . Cournos , whose mind was rapidly moving away from the mystical idealism of The Mask into the grimly ironic Russian realism of his second novel , was  --  as I had discovered  --  too much the dispossessed RussianJew to understand or appreciate the positive side of my country . But O'Brien , despite his medieval Catholicism , was still an authentic product of transatlantic culture . His ambition was to live half as a medieval saint , and half as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for in him the strands of ascetic Christianity and of naive , faunlike paganism never really sorted themselves out . Within a month after his arrival we had planned to go togetherfrom London to a part of the North Wales coast said to be wild and unvisited . Cournos , who had just that spring concluded another affair with one of his numerous London sweethearts , was to accompany us . I have forgotten whether or not I agreed to be financially responsible for Cournos . At any rate , the place we picked on was not only remote but ridiculously cheap . It was at Aber , a tiny village in a wild , romantic valley fed by a celebrated waterfall , beyond Llanfairfechan , close to the celebrated Straits of Bangor and the Isle of Anglesey . Cournos and I journeyed through a late June day to find it ; O'Brien was to follow in two or three days . How comfortable our lodging seemed , and how simple but satisfying our food was , there in that remote Welsh valley , removed alike from London 's unrest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like three schoolboys let loose , from a nightmare which had oppressed our souls for four years  --  and the cost was , as I recall , barely ten dollars a week apiece . My wife , who I had feared might oppose my going , had given less grudging consent to this scheme than to my earlier one of returning to America to live permanently . I had now plenty of work to do , having been fired by my recent reading of Henry Adams 's Education , into a plan of writing my own life , from boyhood up to the end of the War , as a prose narrative of Americaneducation and later expatriation , disguised under fictitiousp269names , and called Jahn Falconer 's Fortune  --  John Falconer being , of course , myself . O'Brien , too , shined with Coln nos and myself our delight in the prospect of finally escaping from London , with its great and ridiculous Allied Victory March ( which should have been called , rather , the Allied March of Humiliation ) scheduled for July . He gleefully looked forward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unspoilt a region as the Aber valley then was . So it happened that the month of July found us all safely esconced there , remote from London and enjoying to the utmost our rambles and walks about the country , excursions to Conway and Beaumaris , and minor adventures in a land already immortalizedby Thomas Love Peacock and George Borrow . Early in August I removed to the near-by sea-bathing village resort of Penmaenmawr , where Daisy and the children came to live with me . O'Brien moved off to Oxford , to find a new home there where he could live with his mother , who was coming over from America that year . I had half finished the story of my own " education , " and had gone from my boyhood up to the close of my college years and my first coming abroad . I had written forty thousand words of prose , and was in better mental and physical condition than I had been for the past three years . And , miracle of miracles , there had now come to me , after all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the past three years , a new series of short lyrics which proved , once for all , that the old symbolist leaven , the vividly pagan and pantheistic delight in nature which had marked Irradiations and the " symphonies , " was still working strongly within me . This new set of lyrics , which came to me without premeditation and spontaneously , as I roved about the uplands and the valleys of that wild Welsh countryside , showed me not only that I had wandered less far from the path which I had marked as my own on the day I set the first " Irradiation " on paper , but also that I was still , despite the sobering effect of the War and the chasteningeffect of my marriage , primarily a romantic pagan , and a lyric and rhapsodic poet to boot . I called these new poems , provisionally , " Gateways , " read them to O'Brien , who was enthusiastic , and dreamed again of becoming the kind of poet I had seemed to be , in my own eyes , at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may still be read by anyone who cares to ex- amine the first section of my book , The Black Rock , published in England and in this country , in 1928 . In the meantime , I had now Edward O'Brien 's warm invitation to come to Oxford and visit him there . As soon as the equinoctial gales , and the opening of the schools , had driven Daisy and myself and the two young people back to London on the twelfth of September , I availed myself gladly of his invitation . Hitherto I had entirely avoided Oxford , as I always avoided , during all the years I spent in England , that pilgrimage shrine of all American tourists , Stratfordon Avon . I regarded the university city less as the idealistic " home of lost causes , " in Matthew Arnold 's famous phrase , than as the spot where John Ruskin had gone to pieces , Newman had retreated from the world into the chill asceticism of the cloister , and Matthew Arnold had himself become transformed from the young Hellenic idealist to the tight-lipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to all these men the magnificent rebels , Shelley and Swinburne and William Morris  --  but they too had gone to Oxford ! I decided , therefore , since O'Brien was so enthusiastic , to visit Oxford at last , and to see the place for myself . Oxford achieved the effect of finally overwhelming me withthe vitality of the medieval tradition . It recalled to mind , in itsperfect harmoniousness of development and singleheartedness ofpurpose , Florence ; but whereas Florence was only a remote survivalof what had been , Oxford was still alive and flourishing . Despite the fact that its manufacturing suburb , Cowley , was alreadybeginning to extend the hideousness of its bungalows aboutthe motorworks put up by a successful British vulgarian , the cityitself and its surroundings had as yet not openly succumbed to thebus traffic , Woolworth shopping , cinema palaces , and other kindredattractions of the mass-production epoch that soon succeededmy visit . Rather was Oxford still a lovely medieval shell , drainedof its vitality during the War years , but now reviving for one lastflare of hectic excitement before reverting to cultivated archaism @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cosmopolitangroup : men whose careers as students had been broken by thesternest of educations in the trenches , American Rhodes scholarsplanning vast projects , colonials rubbing shoulders with the sonsof the British workingmen who had been successful at winningscholarships , and a considerable sprinkling of the **26;4825;TOOLONG of Indian potentates , whom the farseeing British government , realizing the stern struggle in prospect over their hold on India , were now sending at their own expense through these half-deserted halls , in order to familiarize them with the mechanical magic of the West . Throughout this assemblage there were now running strange electric currents of revolt and reaction : neo-Catholicism was flourishing along with bolshevism . Oxford was turning itself into a dozen discussion clubs ( since frowned on or suppressed by the authorities ) , where dangerous new ideas were mooted and intellectual currents ran high . So great was its attraction that I wished I could take twelve years off my age , revert from a married to a single status , and resume here , under happier auspices , the formal education that I had abandoned long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detailed to me by various Rhodes scholars , seemed infinitely superior to the mechanical course taking and credit accountingof the American universities . There the university was paramount , here the individual scholar . There the university existed only to cram the student with facts , here facts were less important than what the student did with them . There learning was divorced from experience , here an eminent don could assure me that it did not matter what the men acquired from their courses so much as what kind of other men they met . Although I had already learned to mistrust the snobbishness and organized hypocrisy of the public schools and the Established Church of England , Oxford unquestionably seemed to me to make the most of the system and to give an unforgettable taste for fine living to those who went through the portals of its colleges . In the midst of this motley society , seething now with all the new currents released by the War , Edward O'Brien was at home . He had established himself to the north of the city , near Headington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removed from Shotover Hill , which had still an old-fashioned , deserted stagecoachroad running across its summit , and which also boasted of the authentic pond where Shelley once sailed his paper boats . I stayed there some two or three weeks , and spent an enchanted time rambling through the colleges , now decked in all their glory of Virginia creeper , or roving about the neighborhood with O'Brien himself . More poems resulted , and also new friendships : with Thomas Earp , friend of Aldous Huxley , and now an art critic of distinction , who just then was planning to firing out London a magazine called Coterie , which duly printed several of my new poems of that year ; with Robert Graves , who had finally taken refuge from the aftermath of the War in a remote rural cottage which he called the World 's End at Islip ; with several American Rhodes scholars . Imbued as I was with all the love of medieval unity and the mistrust of twentieth-century multiplicity that had disengaged itself from Henry Adams 's ironic pages , hater as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottom purposeless " science , " I felt that I could have been at home in Oxford , even more than O'Brien was . Nevertheless , my literary career was making a progress that was barely one degree removed from absolute stagnation . I had given up my half-written attempt at a fictionized autobiography , and neither Elements nor the war poems were publishable in their entirety , as they stood . The only London magazines to which I possessed any chance of entering were Earp 's Coterie , which did not pay , and possibly Middleton Murry 's newly revivedAthenaeum . I had recently taken out of Elements and the war poems those which seemed to me best worth publishing , had combined them in a single volume entitled The Rock in the Storm , and was offering them again around among English publishers . I finally obtained , early in 1920 , an offer that an English firm would publish it if I could obtain an American publisher to market five hundred sheets . And there the matter rested . Meantime , in America , Houghton Mifflin had already @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of print , despite Miss Lowell 's attempt to keep them alive for the students of her book on American poetry . Truly , my return to my own country was now overdue , to say the least . On May 12 , 1920 , I departed from Southampton on the old White Star liner Adriatic , bound for New York . The ship was overcrowded , and as its engines were already in a bad state of repair , the voyage took eight days . Among all its passengers the only one who interested me was a young Englishman named Guy Eglinton , who had been a university student vacationing in Germany at the outbreak of the War , had not escaped in time , and had been interned with a thousand others at Ruhleben , just outside Berlin . There these prisoners , finding themselves free to do as they liked , with the world falling into chaos about them ,  |p273|prom|ptly  organized themselves into an informal university with courses in modern literature , music , drama , and the arts in general . Eglinton had conic back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a London publishing house , and was now on his way to control the New York branch of this firm . He had never seen America , and was genuinely glad to find that I had not only been there , but that I was , by birth , an American . I had met other Ruhleben prisoners in London before meeting him , and I discovered in him the same kind of mentality  --  an enormous hyperaesthetic appetite for culture of all sorts , combined with an intense and shrinking horror of the world and of life in general . The effect of four years of Ruhleben life on its inmates had been not only to give them a singleminded devotion to all the arts which was only comparable to the devotion given to any organized religion , but to make them also feel that this devotion had nothing to do with life in the real world , which they all alike feared and detested . They were , therefore , after the Armistice , like medieval monks wandering over the world after the breakup of their monasteries , half in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of them had already said to me , on the occasion of a concert we both attended in London , the world had always seemed to him so unreal that he half expected any clay to be caught again , and shut up away from it . Such too was very largely Eglinton 's attitude . I made myself responsible for his safety as much as I might , ashore , during the month that I spent in New York , but was unable to see him as often as I wished , owing to the long office hours and hard work he was putting in at the reorganization of his firm . New York affected me almost as strangely as if I too had been an inmate of Ruhleben . I had come from a land and a city where everything still looked old , worn , and shabby , and where most of the inhabitants , including myself , had recently acquired the art of existing on starvation-point war rations , while momentarily expecting the last remnants of their civilization to disappear . In the year and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ barely recovered . Her buildings still looked dingy , her people still wore old clothes , the throwing of millions out of employment after the Armistice had led to the first of her labor troubles , the railway strike of the winter of 1919 , and other labor troubles were already now in the offing.  | An immense army of the unemployed were going to be paid the dole , to keep quiet . Meanwhile the War reparations , wrung from vanquished Germany , were flowing steadily as War debt into America 's coffers . The Americans were now hated as viciously i-i London as they had been adulated during the last days of the War . Since the Senate had thrown out Wilson 's peace treaty and since prohibition , America had become an outlaw nation , unfit for civilized society in English eyes . Between Europe and the American mind stood now a new Chinese wall of misunderstandingand prejudice as great and as insurmountable in its way as the Chinese wall that was being feverishly erected between Europeancivilization on the one hand and the new and untried experimentof Soviet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have said , affected me strangely . After a few days in an outrageously noisy hotel near the Pennsylvania Station I went to more commodious quarters in a quieter region , near Washington Square , where I remained a month . It was the longest stay that I had yet undertaken in the American metropolis ; and it gave me the impression , never entirely lost , that life in New York was somehow unreal , a combination of Arabian Nights fantasy and of clime novel thriller . The city itself , and the countrybehind it , had been totally unaffected by the War , except that there were everywhere signs that prosperity was riding high , unprepared for such a collapse as only came ten years later . In the restaurants , the soda fountains , the quick-lunch places , everyonewore an air of being on the alert to grab his fortune tomorrow  --  millionswere going to be spent and made , and everybody knew it . New cults , Freudian psychoanalysis , fake oriental seers and mystics , Greenwich Village orgies , were already springing up in the wake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Americahad inherited the glittering fragments and was avidly playing with them . The stage was being set for the greatest boom in her history , when everything would be valued only for its power to bring in quick and immediate returns . Wilson , sinking in nerveless collapse , was going , and Harding was coming in . In the meantime , prohibition was already having its effect of increasing the violence of the American temperament . New York , as one of its inhabitants assured me , was becoming a " stick-up " town . Gangsters appeared in open daylight on Forty-second and Broadway . The saloons and drinking places of old had been re/placed by noisy soda fountains and by jazz bands which invaded every restaurant and made night more hideous with intoxicating monotary of din . The cases of drunkenness that were to be openly seen on the streets scented far more raucous and violent than anything I had known in London . The scramble for profit and pleasure , led by a generation only one step removed from the shadow of death , which had attacked London immediately after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reign of sexual license unparalleled since the Restoration of 166o , was sweepingNew York too , despite the revived reaction of the backwoods in favor of such things as Protestant fundamentalism and the Ku Klux Klan . To live in New York was a dizzy but , alas , a costly adventure . During the month that I was there I besieged publishers with my poems , on my own account , only to discover that war poetry and war literature generally were no longer in demand . The revival of interest marked by such prose works as All Quiet on the Western Front was to come only ten years later . I had , however , unexpected success in persuading The Macmillan Company to bring out a volume containing all the American poems I had written during the earlier years of 1914-16 , together with a few others I had managed to write that summer . This book I provisionallycalled Breakers and Granite , and its publication was set for early in 1921 . This done , I departed for Boston , where my younger sister , with her soldier husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not slow in again looking up Miss Lowell . Although I had already gone publicly on record as being critical of her " externality " in my chapbook , brought out in London that May , yet the fact that I had first publicly won my spurs as her foremostdefender in the years 1915 and 1916 still gave to her personality and surroundings the charm of a vivid memory . I was now to see , for the last time , the house where she lived and worked ; but I was not to see the old Miss Lowell , whose work had been so long associated with my own . She had by now becomea great public institution : Doctor of Letters of Baylor University in Texas ( she traveled all the way to Waco in the extremely hot June of my arrival for the degree ) , the Phi Beta Kappa poet at Columbia , and the guide , mentor , and friend of all the young hopefuls at Harvard . Also she had become a sick woman , existing from operation to operation , and straining ; alike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and wider historical perspectives on which to exercise her brilliant and panoramic and , at bottom , fatalistically decorative art . The garden at Sevenels looked lovelier than ever , with its smoke tree in full bloom and covered with large silver drops of rain on the hot afternoon of my arrival . Ada Russell was , as ever , tactful and kind , and took me out for a long walk around the neighborhood , showing me other gardens , each representing a fortune in time and in labor  --  gardens of millionaire families , built up during the seventies  --  shimmering under the intense July sun . They came from the period when New England , victorious industrially over the old South and the adventurous Middle West alike , had begun to expend its intellectual capital on the cosmopolitanluxury of country mansions , elaborate gardens , and art collections , the epoch to which Henry James had already written the epitaph in his Ivory Tower . The other Henry , Henry Adams , had already shown me how this epoch had been , in his eyes , only the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ terms of unlimited greed and unchecked industrial exploitation . These gardens and fine estates were its chief fruits , along with the industrial squalor , the labor unrest , the overwork of the foreign-born proletariat from which their incomes sprang . I decided now that , of the two ladies who alike inhabited Sevenels , Mrs. Russell was the more appreciative and the more sensitive . I was delighted to hear from her lips how , as the daughter of a pioneer English bookseller , she had spent her early life in remote Utah among the Mormons , and how on an early trip to the East with her father the train had been halted for hours while a great herd of buffalo walked across the railroad track . She brought back to mind the distant pattern of an earlier , more heroic , more generous , more charitable , more vividly picturesque America than now existed . Amy was at best only the final and cosmopolitan stage of that kind of existence , making enormous publicity out of her attempt to restate it in the most vivid terms for posterity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circumstanceswhich had made it impossible for her to marry and bear children , a substitute for living . It was now , practically speaking , a religion for itself , though she still scoffed at my attemptsp277to equate art and the religious impulse . Rut it was a religion which required the continuance of the capitalistic system , in all its predatory nakedness , to sustain itself . During the last summerI visited her the emissaries of the I.W.W. were busily fomentingstrikes in the two mill towns named after her family  --  strikes which led directly to the notorious Sacco-Vanzetti case . She expressedpublicly to me her utmost fear and abhorrence of all labor agitators , and even spoke , as I remember , of hiring guards to protect her home . I had not suspected her previously of being so lacking in personal courage . I stayed for three or four days in all at Miss Lowell 's , while my sister prepared to move her household goods down to a more commodious home just outside Newport , Rhode Island , which she had rented for the summer . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new Amy Lowell in all her moods , and to arrive at the sane conclusion that whatever I had missed by failing to make of myself a public figure on her lines , what she had missed by making herself into one was in reality far greater . Our new relationship was now symbolized by this outstandingfact : that though I still listened to her reading of her poems to me as of old , I offered no poems of mine in return . I made no secret , however , of the fact that I regarded myself , compared with her enormous success , to be a failure . On the last night of my stay she read to me , in a voice full of feeling , a poem which she had just composed : " I moved to the sound of gold and brass and heavily-clashed silver . From the towers , the watchers see the flags of my coming : Tall magenta flagsStinging against a pattern of light blue . Trumpets and tubasExult for me before the walls of cities ; And I pass the gates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  you come only as a harebell comes . One day there is nothing ; and the next , your steepled bells are all . The rest is background . You are neither blue , nor violet , nor red , But all these colors blent and faded to a charming weariness of tone ; I glare ; you blossom . Yes , alas , and when they have clanged me to my grave , Wrapped gaudily in pale-blue and magenta ,  | When muted bugles and slacked drums Have brayed a last quietus ; What then , my friend ? " Why , someone coming from the funeral Will see you nodding underneath a hedge , ( Picking or not is nothing ) . Will that person remember bones and shouting do you think ? I fancy he will listen to the music Shaken so lightly from your whispering bells ; And think how very excellent a thingA flower growing in a hedge most surely is . And so , a fig for rotting carcasses ! " Waiter , bring me a bottle of Lachrima Christi , And mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my highly unsuccessful confrere , Rocking your seed-bells while I drift to ashes . The future is the future , therefore  --  Damn you ! "  | At the end of August I departed from America again . Duringthe three months of my stay I had already achieved for myself the object of getting my American poems published , and had also , during the last weeks in New York , disposed of my book on Paul Gauguin to another New York publisher . I had not succeeded in getting the two books which Houghton Mifflin had brought out , and which they had decided to let go out of print , transferred to another publisher ; but I had persuaded Macmillan , who was bringing out Breakers and Granite , to import copies from England of The Tree of Life . As for the poems of the War years , I now definitely abandoned them as unsalable . I was the more pleased with this result , since it had been achieved entirelyon my own account , without direct help from Miss Lowell , and in the face of handicaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York , working on a constitution weakenedby the nervous strain and privation of the later War years , had affected me so much that my digestive system had practically collapsed ; and during the entire time I was on Manhattan Island I was in constant dread of an appendicitis operation . The month of August , spent at Newport in the company of my sisters and their families , had restored me somewhat , but I eventually departedfrom America in almost as poor a state of body and nerves as I had come . I had , however , made new contacts , and had acquired new and valuable friends . One of the most valuable had been the St. Louis poet , Sara Teasdale Filsinger , about whom Miss Lowell had spoken before I left America in 1916 , and whose husband had gone to the trouble of looking me up in London during the spring following the Armistice . I had been overwhelmed by the news he then brought me , that the writing of a single poem , my " Lincoln , " had made me one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my departure , someone to be mentioned in the same breath with Vachel Lindsay and Amy Lowell . Since " Lincoln " had been a poem written to fit a special occasion  --  the occasionp28o being America 's entry in the War , which this poem anticipated by a full year  --  I did not suppose my work would continue to have the popularity this particular work had given it . NeverthelessI was glad to learn through Sara Teasdale 's husband that my poetry , in one respect , at least , was now rousing popular acclaim . In New York I had come to know Mrs. Filsinger also and to value her as a friend . In her I found a refreshing contrast to the enormously busy , enormously successful , dynamic , and dominating personality of Miss Lowell . Markedly fragile in appearance and shrinking from contact with humanity , she recalled H. D. in most respects , except that she had never acquired the cultivated archaism which was so marked a feature of H. D. 's talent , and which sometimes had seemed to me , in H. D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refined her lyricism to a simplicity of statement that was very moving and very human , and that seemed to me  --  although it was obviously rooted in sentimental nostalgia  --  far removed from the elaborate and sophisticated self-exploitationthat was now being practiced by such a figure as Edna St. Vincent Millay . I admired her art , equally compounded of the quietism of Christina Rossetti and the emotional intensity of Emily Dickinson , though she herself declared that she did not value it , finding , she said , her lyricism one-sided , and her own personality somewhat tiresome . Personally , I did not agree with her , for it seemed to me that her work , though limited , was singularly and scrupulously perfect . And in a world where very few American poets had this quality of craftmanship ( though Elinor Wylie was to display it later ) , it seemed to me that Sara Teasdale deserved a niche of her own . She was two years older than I , and therefore belonged less to the modern , ultrasophisticated , post-War generation of American poets than to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gropingly sincere kind . As such I found her company stimulating in a quiet way , whether it was in her telling how she had grown up in St. Louis as a near neighbor to T. S. Eliot , or in anecdotes about Vachel Lindsayand his background , with which she abounded . She had warmly recommended me to try Macmillan as a publisher , and to keep on trying  --  advice that I concluded to take , with results as already set forth . I had long lost any prejudice I may have felt against Lind/say 's poetry . ever since the appearance of " The Congo " and " The Chinese Nightingale  --  " I had realized that this poet deserved the acclaim which American audiences were giving him . He had achieved a fusion of popular American subject matter and vivid rhythmic and dramatic presentation which made him the chief folk artist among the American poets . It seemed to me that he had largely fulfilled the task only half accomplished by such earlier American folk singers as James Whitcomb Riley , Irwin Russell , and Paul Laurence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sentimental and yet not false , popular and yet not cheap , democratic and yet full of heightened imagination . Through Sara Teasdale I heard that he was expected to visit London that year , and when I returned , early in September , I found that he had already arrived . His coming was well heralded . The critics of the London press had already been busy , and the foremost of the academic pontiffs , J. C. Squire , had led off his London Mercury of that month with the " Bryan " poem in its entirety , and had followed this up with critical remarks to the effect that Vachel Lindsay was the only American poet who mattered , inasmuch as he was the only one whose attitude and subjectmatter were totally and exclusively American . I met Lindsay immediately after my return to England , and some days before his big public reading  --  the most elaborate publicreading I have ever seen accorded to an American poet in England  --  at Central Hall , Westminster . What astonished me about him was his extraordinary juvenility of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause , I soon saw , lay in Lindsay himself . He seemed to feel that they represented only one minor phase of his talent , and that his destiny had been rather to be a painter . On an afternoon visit to my home he declared that he had spent the entire morning looking at Turner 's " Ulysses DeridingPolyphemus " in the Tate Gallery . To be able to paint like that was his chief ambition . He had recently , in anticipation of his arrival , sent me a copy of his Village Magazine , and I was enabled , by looking at its pages , to judge how far he actually could carry his pretension to be a visual artist , as well as a poet , into effect . I concluded that these naive and at bottom monotonouslysimilar line drawings of balloons and spiderwebs gave not only clear evidences of complete misuse of talent : they were not even a beginning towards acquiring one . Lindsay was then , as I had been at twenty-six , a talent turned hack on itself , arrested ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not by facing his own obstacles and overcoming them , but by becoming a mixture of backwoods evangelist and playboy ; a picturesquefigure certainly , but not , as Squire had said , the sole American poet , unless America was to be forever synonymous with immaturity . And Lindsay was emotionally immature still at forty . The secret of his arrested development lay less , however , in himself than in the gaunt figure with withered face , white hair , and spectacles who stood at his side and accompanied him everywherearound London  --  his mother , now past seventy years of age . Her existence , I realized , revealed the secret of why Lindsay had never come to terms with himself nor with the world about him , but had escaped into a child 's fairy tale world of circus calliopes , golden whales , Chinese nightingales , voodoo magic , and other bright-colored but largely unreal toys . The type was familiar : the pioneer schoolteacher , who satisfies her secret and shamefaced craving for beauty vicariously through another 's destiny , while forbidding beauty to express itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well as in the inward imagination . In short , Mrs. Lindsay was the eternal and unquenchable Puritan , hating the cavalier side of the South , hating all those who , like myself , did not believe prohibition to be the greatest reform of the ages . Listening to her as she spoke to me in my home in London , I could not help feeling that if Lindsay had been able to escape from her influence , to give himself to life bodily as well as mentally , to achieve happiness through the normal way of marriage , his mental development would not have been so pitifully onesidedas to leave him , in middle age , still pathetically dreaming of how his life might have shaped itself had he become , not a poet , but a painter . How truly Lindsay was his mother 's victim only appeared twelve years after this , in the tragedy of his end . From the moment I discovered the complete hold his mother had on him I began to realize that , though he had , and could maintain , his eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attain to final greatness as a poet because of this handicap unwittinglylaid on his life by his mother 's influence.  |p283Nevettheless  , here he was in London , having momentarily and successfully turned the tables on all the English lecturers  --  many of them obviously second-rate  --  who were now swarming through America . 1 was interested to know what my American friends would make of him . H. D. gave no opinion , being already on her way to America . Cournos , to my surprise , rather naively enjoyed him , as a modern version of the old troubadours . But the most illuminating comments came from T. S. Eliot and Kira Pound . Pound , who was present at the public reading at Central Hall ( I did not see him privately now , and had never clone so since our break in 1916 ) , declared before the large audiencethere assembled that Lindsay 's poems were in reality libretti , needing the charm of Lindsay 's personality and the special qualityof his voice to be transmuted into art . Eliot , who had just met him , curtly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appalledat Lindsay . " Neither of these verdicts seemed to me entirelycorrect ; but of the two , I preferred Pound 's . I had returned to England , despite the definite feeling in my bones that my place as a writer lay less in England than in America , but in the full knowledge that my wife would oppose any permanent removal for herself and the children to the country for whose literature I was now putting forth my best efforts . I decided therefore to wait and to exert my best efforts to modify her position . In the next year my Breakers and Granite and my Gauguin book were going to be published in America , and I anticipated , not only an artistic , but a commercial success from them . Unfortunately , the success , in the latter respect at least , did not altogether meet with my expectations . The Gauguin book , printed from the manuscript I had written back in 1918 , was , I knew , barely more than an introduction to its subject . I had hoped to revise it , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact that its American publisher , whom I had inadvertently trusted , went into bankruptcy the following year prevented me from collecting a penny from him beyond his first meager advance . Breakers and Granite , suffering from bad proofreading during the course of my illness , was not advertised widely by its publishers , and sold but slowly . Nineteen-twenty now merged itself into 1921 . Seven years had gone by since I had scored my first successes , and if my physical constitution had been changed by the renewal of the tissues of my body , still more had my mental outlook and my intellectual status . I was now an independent poet and critic iii my own right , known to a few in England , and had recently made a fresh attempt to recommend myself to the attention of the many in America . I continued to live in England , having now firmly decided not , under any circumstances , to return to America unless I could obtain my wife 's consent to accompany me . I realized , indeed , that my financial condition being what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England than in America . The circle of my acquaintancesthere was slowly widening , thanks to my contacts with Oxford and to a long-delayed friendship that was now slowly springing up between Harold Monro and myself . Now I could , had I but chosen to make the effort , have achieved for myself a small but perhaps increasing reputation in London . But the fact that I had not succeeded in doing so during my early years , added to the fact that my interests were still almost entirely American , made me doubt whether the goal were really worth the effort . I would have preferred to make the effort in America , where a new hard-boiled generation , just emerging from the War , were busily engaged in capturing the center of the literary arena , aided by a flock of new and adventurouspublishing houses . I knew that in London I would either have to accept British standards or stand aloof . And since acceptanceof British standards was , in my case , largely incompatible with the kind of literary functioning I had been most apt at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detached and resigned contemplation . Lindsay had come and gone from London , leaving behind nothing more important than the momentary gasp of astonishment that has followed the career of dozens of other popular entertainersthere . Pound was about to quit London for Paris , declaiming bitterly at the last that England was only a corpse , kept alive by maggots . Eliot was still struggling at Lloyd 's Bank . His health had seemed on the point of giving way ; attempts were being made to provide him with a small fund . Though he had published in 1920 The Sacred Wood to the sound of generalcritical acclamation , his poetry still was known only to a small minority . Cournos was away at Oxford , helping O'Brien with his short-story books . H. D. was retiring , driven by illhealthand unhappiness into obscurity . Looking around the Eng/lish literary scenc. , now that Shaw , Wells , Galsworthy , and Conradwere becoming old men , and Thomas I lardy had celebrated his eightieth birthday , one had the impression of living in a land of pygmies . A generation had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none left to take its place . As for the War itself , that was a dead issue , and the War poets were becoming forgotten in t heir ' turn . The present day being obviously barren , there seemed little for England to do but to foster obvious revivals of the past . Accordingly , late Elizabethan drama , Restoration comedy , and finally Victorianism itself were solemnly taken out of the vaults of the past , dusted off , and again displayed to the public . And the young heroes of that day became either uprooted and disillusionedcynics , on the lines of Aldous Huxley , or adepts in striking unusual attitudes , like the three Sitwells . London was , as Pound had said , effectually dead . One need only look across the Atlantic to find that America , by comparison , was becoming crowded with major figures . I had decided , whether rightly or wrongly , not to return to America unless accompanied by Daisy ; but I soon realized that neither she nor I was in good enough condition to make the trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ powers at my disposal . My own physical condition slowly improved ; Daisy 's did not . Her physical troubles , I soon discovered , came from the fact that she was now undergoing the change of life , a circumstancewhich made me reflect more and more bitterly on our disproportion of ages . Up to that time I had never attempted to find out just how much older than I she really was . She had declaredthat she did not recall the year of her birth , and I had accepted her statement . I had stated the difference , on the police documents and passports of the War years , to be seven years  --  that being my own guess  --  but I now discovered that it was nearer twelve . It was useless , I knew , to reproach her for being what she was . I had taken her for better or for worse ; but I only felt all the more that so much ill luck and disappointment had already accompanied our marriage that the only chance of our happiness and harmony in the future lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my own country . Unfortunately , Daisy 's own character seemed to be now changing under the stress of her physical condition . She had been normally bright and cheerful , a practical housekeeper , de- voted to tier home and children , a good hostess to my friends , with an interest in the arts which , though not deep , was neverthelessgenuine . She now became listless , brooding , moody , and querulous , difficult to arouse from a state of melancholy apathy . Fired by my renewed success in America , I had returned to urge on her an immediate migration ; but she felt , and no doubt the feeling was normal under her present physical state , that in my asking her to abandon all her old life , and to adapt herself to a new set of circumstances , I was accomplishing an act of final betrayal . The winter of 1920-21 was one of the most difficult I had ever lived through . I realized now how hard it was going to be for me to adjust myself henceforward to a marriage that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exile from America that might very likely remain permanent , unless I could induce my wife in some way to feel a renewed interest in living . Early in the spring of 1921 , around Easter , I succeeded in inducing her to leave the house and the two young people in it to the charge of her sister , while the two of us went away for a fortnight 's holiday in the Channel Islands . I would have gone further , to the South of France , but  --  though living conditions had cheapened since the War  --  I did not feel I could afford so long a trip . The change of scene and air seemed genuinely to benefit Daisy . She began to pick up and appear her normal self again , while I , for my part , did not press her to come with me to America . We decided to return to Jersey with the youngsters that summer . On the way back , as the Channel steamer took us along through a sparkling spring day , the thought came to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving America , in fact  --  and that I might very well spend the next summer in writing a long poem . It had seemed to me for some time past that the real test of a poet 's ability , both as artist in words and as spokesman for humanity , lay in his power to achieve a long poem of heroic or epic cast . None of the imagists had faced this test , with the sole exception of Miss Lowell , and her long panoramicpoems did not seem to me to spring from any profoundly held philosophy . During my visit to America in the previous summer I had thought of taking the American Civil War as the possible subject for such a poem . I had again begun to read andp287ponder on the subject , but had been finally dissuaded by a conversation with Edwin Arlington Robinson , during which he pointed out , with logic which had scented largely inescapable , that the issues which led to and precipitated that conflict had been so confused on both sides that it was next to impossible for a poet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jus-t ice io them all . Now it seemed to me that it might yet be possible to salvage the essence of my projected Civil War poem , by transposing it out of the dimension of historic fact into the dimension of myth and fable . After all , the American Civil War had been a conflictbetween two opposing views , two diametrically opposite ways of living : the agrarian , feudal way of the South , and the industrial , mercantile way of the North . Did not this dualism , this divided aim in living , which had led to my country 's greatest crisis , interpose itself in all human affairs ? Was I not already being forced to adjust myself to just such a division in aim between the way of living practiced in England and that I had grown accustomed to in America ? It seemed to me that I was . And could not such a dualism be transferred from the temporary to the universal , could it not even be upheld as the general law of the universe ? It seemed to me , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Southampton , that it not only could , but that in the restatement of such a dualism lay the essential theme of my projected long poem . The house at Sydenham , which I had now decided to have repapered and refurnished  --  using for this purpose the money I had carefully husbanded since my American trip , in the prospect of a possible migration to America  --  was still in the hands of the workmen when I returned . I employed the last weeks in April in a walking excursion with Edward O'Brien through the Cotswold country , while it was being made ready . I now detailed to him my plan . I would write a long poem , dealing with the events narratedin the Bible ; both Old and New Testaments would be included . It would be modeled upon William Blake 's Prophetic Books , which I had studied carefully ever since the last year of the War , and also upon Milton 's Paradise Lost , which I now concluded , despite the dislike for it expressed by Amy Lowell , Ezra Pound , and all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would , however , use another style , and other supernatural machinery ,  | than Milton 's . The characters in my poem would he , first of all , man , represented by Adam , and then by his descendants ; Jehovah , as creator ; and Lucifer . Jehovah would be the power that creates , and strives to do good . He would be symbolized by inactive darkness , the creative darkness which brooded on the abyss at the beginning of things , the darkness in which the seeds of life take life in the womb of the earth , the darkness that eternally encompassesthe light of day-born human knowledge . Lucifer , on the other hand , would be the active light-bringer , the willful , resolute , skeptical , ironic ruler of time and of history . He would be eternally thwarting , and yet unwittingly accomplishing , Jehovah 's vast and formless plans . Thus man would be inevitably swayed by a dualism , alternately accepting Jehovah 's and Lucifer 's point of view . The whole poem would take me , I thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be in all its parts a detailedexposition of Blake 's epigram , " Good is the passive that obeys reason . Evil is the active springing from energy . " It would do , without the abuse of symbolism , what Blake had attempted in his Prophetic Books to do : to state the tragedy of man strugglingthrough time to reach God , by alternate paths of inactive acceptance and of open rebellion . And its conclusion would be the Crucifixion , by which man , passively accepting death , becameJehovah on the Cross , while the entire earth was thereby Lucifer 's , to work his will . Thus I would fulfill my poetic destinyand restate the creed which I had already set forth in my letter to Linscott of 1919 . This was the plan I now laid before Edward O'Brien on our walking excursion through the Cotswolds . He was enthusiastic about it , and urged me to do it . As a matter of fact , I had already begun on my writing . Groups of lines , from ten to twenty , all cast in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that William Blake had first discovered and had employed in his " Vala , " were forming themselves in my mind . These lines came , as much in the " symphonies " had come , spontaneously to me , whenever I reflected on any of the numberless host of charactersthat would people my poem . Thus my notebooks were rapidly crammed with long passages which related to Adam and Eve , to Cain and Noah , to Abraham and Jacob , to Moses , David , Solomon , Job , and Christ . All this before I had organized myp289poem into various sections . I now understood why Blake , who I realized must he my model here even more than Milton , had failed to achieve a coherent narrative out of any of his Prophetic Books , and also why lie had claimed to write solely " according to the Spirit 's dictate . " I let myself run on thus for a month or so , filling my notebookwith disconnected passages , till about the middle of July , when the time came to move with my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to remain till the middle of September . Then , slowly , out of all this welter of material , the first four books began to take shape . The first would deal with the creation of earth and of man . The second , with man 's conquest of the earth , through the discovery of fire , symbolized in the story of Cain and Abel . The third , with the achievement of a city civilization , as opposed to a rural culture , and as expressed in the story of Cain 's descendants . And the last would contain the story of Noah and the flood . These four books would serve as a beginning , as the four Cantos which Ezra Pound published that year were a beginning to his own long poem . I could publish them separately , as an introduction to and earnest of whatever might follow . We  --  my wife and I and the young people  --  left London , as I have said , about the middle of July , and took train to Southampton . After a changeable and treacherous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had not rained since May , and the green fields already looked parched and brown , under the unvaryingblue sky ; even the trees and hedgerows were already scorched and withered . Nor did it rain in Jersey , while we were there , except towards the close of our stay . This long unbroken stretch of dry weather , leading to much agitation concerning a water shortage , was so strange , so uncommon , and at bottom so un-English , that it gave to my poem  --  on which I now worked steadily for two months , writing every day  --  a quality of nervous tension and of increasing excitation that was rather American than English . When I returned the first four books were alreadydrafted . I realized that they were violent and rebellious , yet it seemed to me that this , as it stood , was the most ambitious work I had yet undertaken . I had fused together the vivid orchestralpresentation of my " symphonies " with my later specu- lations on humanity , on life and on its destiny , on the struggle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . Already , by the time of my return , the horizon of the Europeansituation , in which England was still inextricably involved , had darkened appreciably . The " Bolshevik menace , " which the Allies had been unable to crush even by promoting civil war , had , for the moment , spent itself ; the Red armies no longer threatened Warsaw , and Lenin had modified extremism and was moving towards his new economic policy . But nearer at hand were the seeds of future wars . Under the influence of the now thoroughly chauvinistic government , the French were threatening to occupy the Ruhr  --  and did occupy it in defiance of their Allies , in the first months of 1923 . The coalition government of Lloyd George and Bonar Law could find no reply , as they had found none to the unemployed , and to the situation at home . They were now slowly crumbling in consequence , under the attacksof labor . Liberalism was passing from the English stage , as it had already passed in France , as it was about to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up into open civil war . Mussolini had organized his party , and was to embark next year on his dramatic march on Rome . In Germany the weaponless , hopeless government was about to make Germany 's fulfillment of the Treaty of Versailles forever impossible by passing through national bankruptcy . Truly , one hundred years after Napoleon 's death , Europe was about to enter the first act of a tragedy which was infinitely greater and more poignant than the disaster which had come to it because of Napoleon . It seemed as if only some great and messianic religion , as great in its way as primitive Christianity , could free mankind . At this juncture I heard again from O'Brien that he was leaving his home in Oxford , and also leaving his mother and Cournos behind in it . He was about to embark alone for the Continent , on an attempt to achieve what he had spoken of as his " mission " during our meeting in the spring . I had been inclined , for once , to take him seriously . The idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic Church alone , but throughout the entire Christian world , a revival  --  but this time among laymen  --  of the spirit that had animated the early Franciscanbrotherhood . O'Brien himself was to be the founder of these new Franciscans , living according to the dictates of pov/erty , chastily , and obedience , in the world and yet not of it , the new " holy fools , " the landless and propertyless world scorners of Europe as the Treaty of Versailles had it . They would oppose bolshevism and capitalism alike with a new devotion to the Christ image , which O'Brien claimed to have seen in a vision as a child , and had recently seen again . Thousands and then millionsof recruits would join them , as soon as the idea was broached ; great miracles would take place , and the world would be reconvertedto the faith of medieval Christianity . Now I heard from O'Brien himself that the time had come when the new creed which would remake the world would shortly be proclaimed in the market place at Florence at the spot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Renaissance which had killed Savonarola , and the rebirth of the Middle Ages . He was already on his way to Paris and Italy to fulfill his destiny . He would write to me and to Cournos , his two best friends in England , as to the course of the project . He added , as conclusion to his letter , that if he failed , he hoped I would be the first to turn against him , as Judas had turned against Christ . All this sounded sufficiently wild and even insane , but perhaps in a world where the European nations had long since gone mad only some such major insanity could save the world . Rationalisticscience itself , after triumphing in every department of life from the sixteenth to the opening years of the twentieth century , had finally failed to bring about the great dream of the eighteenth century , the era in which man lived in harmony with nature , and in harmony with his own fellow men . Instead , an age of unchecked laissez-faire competition had come to a close in 1914 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had proven , once and for all , that man was not a rational animal , and was not governed by rational considerations . Had Christianity itself not been so unworldly throughout the Middle Ages as to believe in miracles , Europe would never have achieved any lastingculture at all . Even the Renaissance had only existed thanks to the stored-up energy of the Middle Ages , from which it turned into the barren bypaths of mechanical science . Now the Renaissanceitself stood condemned , not only for the slaughter of the War , but for the shame and horror of the peace . Russia had escaped , had restored an unworldly faith , a faith no longer Christian , but combining the extremes of unworldly asceticism , and messianic belief , and fatalistic , militant , Mohammedanlike obedienceto the state . Europe had no reply to Russia , unless she too could restore the faith of the Middle Ages . And if Europe was doomed , America , too , must fall . So I half thought , as letters , exhortations , rhetorical prose poems entitled " Hard Sayings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first from Paris , then from Florence . Here was I , planning to conclude my long and unfinished poem with the Crucifixionof man , while my friend was already embarked on a projectwhich touched not only literature but life itself , and which would conclude not with the Crucifixion , but with the Resurrection . I wished to heaven I could have gone with him , could have taken part in his " mission . " Unfortunately , I could not do so . Although I had not once set foot on the Continent since the Armistice , although I had only once revisited America , stayingin England for the sake of economy , my financial resources were far too meager for me to indulge in any evangelicism such as O'Brien was now attempting to promote . My stepson , now sixteen , was going to college that fall ; my stepdaughter , now eighteen , was still at an art school , and showing strong signs of falling in love with a fellow student as penniless as herself . These , and my wife , had the first claim ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ participation in his project till it matured further . Then I might perhaps come in . Had he not promised me by all his gods that it would succeed , and had he not declared furthermorethat I might be his Judas if it failed ? I would stay where I was , and wait events . Meantime , by every mail , further " Hard Sayings " kept pouringin from him  --  prose poems couched in violent Rimbaudlike rhetoric , exhorting mankind to seek a new vision of Christ . Very well ; I would see what I could do in this vein . I laid aside my unfinished long poem and embarked on a series of short prose poems . These I decided to call Parables.  | Parables , with additions dating from 1923 , was published finally in 1925 . Branches of Adam , the first four books , revisedand shortened , of my yet unfinished long poem , appeared a year later . Both of these publications were confined to England , and though they brought about a certain amount of discussion among the reviewers there , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since both are still largely unknownin the country of my birth , and both are integral to my development as a poet , I shall have to discuss them here together . As I have already indicated , the problem of my own personalsalvation , not only as poet but as man , had affected me powerfully from the very onset of my literary career . I was not one of those who found it easy to come to terms with the world , or with humanity . On the contrary , I felt that it was my destiny to scorn the world as it was , as all the important writers of the nineteenth century had scorned the world , in order that mankind might , through my example , make the world they lived in better . I had felt , as far back as 1913 , that mankind was destined , not for happiness , but for perfection . And perfection was only to be achieved either through a life of physical hardship , remote obscurity , and adventurous daring such as had come to Arthur Rimbaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all family ties as had been the choice of the later Tolstoy . Temporarily , I had resolved this , the first of my moral dilemmas , by accepting the religion of art in its most extreme form , and by believing that beauty , unaided , could save the world . Under the influence of this creed I had written Irradiations and the " symphonies , " Japanese Prints and The Tree of Life . I had thereby not only achieved a literary reputation in America for myself , but had been the means of giving other poets  --  such as Miss Lowell and Conrad Aiken  --  an impetus which carried them into other fields . The War had come , and the horror of its continuance , asp291well as the more than doubtfulness of its result , had made my creed of beauty henceforward untenable . My ideas now took another tack . I knew that from now on a life of adventurous physical activity would be impossible ; I was no longer young enough to undertake it . A life of ascetic rejection of all property and family @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wi fey and two young people dependent on me for their support . I had already won my spurs as a writer , and a writer I must remain to the end . But my first aesthetic phase , in which I expressed my gospel of salvation through nature and through personal and private feeling for nature , was now at an end . Since the coming of the War what had increasingly mattered was not nature , but humanity . As I had written Miss Lowell in 1917 : " Since 1816 , I have wanted with all my heart to do nothing but write about humanity  --  not about landscapes . But I still find I can not say all that I have to say about life . As you say , the War has certainly brought this about in me  --  it has produced a tremendous clash between my imagination and the reality  --  and the results of that clash will change me , have already changed me tremendously . But not enough  --  I feel that I am still groping my way along a very dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , will glimmer upon me bit by bit . " I had begun my new attempt to deal with man and with human life , in 1916-18 , by writing the two abortive books of Elements and of the war poems . From these I had finally turned aside , in the exultation and relief of the peace year , 1919 , to the group of poems entitled " Gateways , " now standing at the forefront of my book , The Black Rock , published in 1928 . These had been largely a return , in a more heightened and religious mood , to the personal-feeling phase of my Tree of Life , or of my " symphonies . " They had led me inevitably to the point of view expressed in Parables and Branches of Adam . What that point of view was , I must now make clear . It had occurred to me that what was , after all , interesting about humanity was less the accidents of any individual life than the tendencies inherent in humanity as a whole . Shortly after America 's entry into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ individual counts for nothing , except as the mouthpiece or interpreterof the elemental forces of his own kind  --  the great simple values of life , love , death , faith , courage , endurance , suf/feting and the rest . " She hail protested that to her the individual was still paramount , that it the individual had to subordinate himself for the sake of the War , that subordination was only temporary , and was akin to combating an attack of illness . Then she had continued : " ' These things are likely to occur in the lives of individuals and of races , and that any philosophic system or religion for the guidance of life can be formed without taking such events into consideration , is inconceivable to me . . . . The great principles you mention  --  life , love , death , faith , courage , endurance , suffering  --  have always been the proper subjects for poetry , but I have always felt that they should be represented through images and dramas , rather than definitely spoken about . I thought we called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eschew it . " To this criticism of my new position I had replied : " To me it still seems that the individual is , after all , only the product of certain great race-tendencies that now and then surge up irresistiblyor subside . " And such , whether cosmic or not , remained my position at the close of the War . I still wished to write about humanity , about individuals . But the individuals I wished to write about were to be used , as the landscapes of my earlier poetry had been used , to symbolize certain eternal tendencies in man . Thereby I thought of making my art , as William Blake had said , " an allegory addressed to the intellectual understanding . " The chief tendency of humanity , throughout human history , had been , it appeared to me , man 's continued and ever-renewed search for God . As St. Augustine had said , " We are lonely and dissatisfied , and our hearts are ever restless till they rest in Thee . " Even Nietzsche , the severest critic of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God was dead " in order , immediately afterward , to procliam a new God , in the shape of the superman . Man 's desire to become God , to fathom the secrets of the divine nature , had taken many forms , but the most dramatic , the most intensely vivid , the one which had changed the entire course of European history , was the form expressed by the figure of Jesus Christ . Although I was not officially a Christian , had never been one since the outbreak of the War and the abandonment of the spirit of Christianity by the churches , it still seemed to me , as it seemed to Dostoevski , that if " the Truth excluded the figure of Christ , I would rather abide with Christ , than with the Truth . " But if the figure of Christ represented man 's highest attempt towards perfection , no less valid as a part of man 's naturewas the figure that Dostoevski had symbolized by his " Parable of the Grand Inquisitor , " the figure of Antichrist : the skeptical , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given man " not perfection , but contentment . " My Parables and my long poem were both illustrations of this point of view  --  a point of view highly heretical , as it left man the prey of a dualism , and stated that the path to " the kingdom of heaven " lay in man himself , and not in the dogmas of the churches . It was also , though I was unaware of it at the time , a highly unpopular point of view to bring forward after the War , because at the root of it lay an uncompromising acceptance not of realism , but of idealism . The collapse of human ideals after the War was not only notoriously manifest in Church and state , but in the individual himself . In the tidal wave of universal cynicism which swept over the world in the wake of that meaninglessand senseless debauch of slaughter , all that seemed left to man was the individual 's private lust , his self-centered greed , his shameless and irresponsible self-seeking . By upholding man 's search for God as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and my Branches of Adam I was committing myself to a final anachronism , greater even than the anachronism I had committedmyself to by becoming primarily a poet . It was not I , but the Irishman , James Joyce , who was the hero of this age and the idol of the post-War generation . He had carried the technique of naturalistic realism one step further than Flaubert and Zola , to the point where man 's unconscious life , expressed in his dreams and his secret desires , had joined with the efforts of his conscious will . And he had shown how both sprang from the same root of greed and lust . Although still inescapablyCatholic  --  O'Brien had assured me that he was , in fact , a spoiled priest  --  he had revolted against his Catholicism to the point of blaspheming all the poetic ornamentation of his faith ; and had agreed with the Jewish pessimist , Sigmund Freud , in thinking that religion was merely an illusion . I could , and did , admire his courage , his honesty , his refusal to compromise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mankind as a race of Yahoos . To him even his hero , himself , Stephen Dedalus , the last impulse of nineteenth-century idealism in him grown self/centered and solipsistic , was nothing but a tragic failure . The triumphant force of life was no longer iii him , but in the horribleLeopold Bloom . Neither heroism , nor faith , nor courage , nor any of the values I had mentioned in my letter to Miss Lowell , mattered now at all . Mankind was henceforth merely animal , groveling in a sty . Or as another ultramodern poet had said : " After such knowledge , what forgiveness ? Think now History has many cunning passages , contrived corridors And issues , deceives with whispering ambitions , Guides us by vanities . Think nowShe gives when our attention is distractedAnd what she gives , gives with such supple confusions That the giving famishes the craving . Gives too late What 's not believed in , or if still believed , In memory only , reconsidered passion . Gives too soon Into weak hands , what 's thought can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear nor courage saves us . Unnatural vices Are fathered by our heroism . VirtuesAre forced upon us by our impudent crimes . " Soon after Edward O'Brien 's vast and messianic mission to redeem humanity had collapsed , in the spring of 1922 , before the more immediate and insistent claims of a female novelist of the " emancipated " sort , I took again the road to Paris , which I had not seen since the spring of 1913 . I decided to go where James Joyce  --  from his obscure retreat in the Latin Quarter  --  now lorded it over the vast hordes of uprooted Americans , Japanese , English , East Europeans , Scandinavians , and Jews , over the seething chaos of homosexuals , Lesbians , neo-Royalists , Communists , dadaists , and hangers-on of every new movement under the sun . I had not seen Joyce except for one casual encounter in London , when I sat studying his dark and somberly flushed face , with its eyes peering half blind behind their thick lenses , in a restaurant for an hour . But by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient . I had written my own Parables and Branches of Adam largely as a counterblast . They still awaited a publisher . I was content to wait till I could find one . In the meantime I would go to Paris and there see what had become of the city where my first major creative outburst had come , in 1913 . The experience was disheartening . Paris was no longer a city , if by a city one means a social and cultural unity , governed by unwritten but accepted standards , and revealing a single set of dominating characteristics . Rather was it megalopolis , a seethingchaos where a dozen to twenty nationalities fought like dogs over the fragments of that culture which had still been in French hands down to 1914 , and which was in French hands no longer . The French themselves were interested now in nothing but politics  --  and as masters in their own eyes of the European political game , as the dominating military and economic power of Europe , they had left culture to the foreigner to carry on . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drinking den and brothel , if one could dignify the nightly spectacle of Montparnasse by applying to it such names . One need actually learn no more French to take part in it than was necessary to order one 's drinks and obtain one 's rooms . Even that meager knowledge was not necessary , for the French , having now devaluedtheir currency , were rapidly learning American-English in order to cope with the mob of barbarians who , in increasing swarms , were invading their capital . The spectacle of the great cafes , the Dome , the Rotonde , with their glittering electric signs resembling Coney Island or Broadway , the drunken fights within , and the feverish and utterly uprooted mobs sitting at the tables absorbing all they wanted of French culture by the quart , was so fascinating to the remaining Parisians that they gathered every evening on the pavements outside to see what was going on within . Under the pressure of this all-pervading invasion , even the traditional French politeness was breaking down . Americans were becoming not only disliked , but despised , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their country . Such was Paris under the influence of what the other great literary figure of the period , the American expatriate Gertrude Stein , had called the " lost generation " : no longer the great center of literature and of art , but the greatest market and rag fair of culture and of international license in the world . I was destined to see it three times during the post-War years : first , ten years after my Irradiations , in the summer of 1923 ; then in the spring of 1925 ; and the last time in the summer of 1930 . Each time , the city which I had once preferred to London , and where I had learned and felt so much about my own art of poetry in my early years , left on me the same impression : an organism stillp299functioning , but 1with the heart gone out of it .  --  ' here now were the French virtues of clarity , of logic , of reason , of intellectual esprit that had formed and maintained this heart ? No one seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a few radical and advancedSocialists , like the editors of the magazine Europe whom I met through Leon Bazalgette , the French translator of Whitman , on my second visit , and for whom I promised to do occasionalpapers on the literary and intellectual life of England . The sole result of the War had been that each nation engaged in it had changed its virtues and its vices with another , as the Irish mystic , AE , long ago prophesied . The French were now like the pre-War Germans ; the Germans were like the pre-War English ; the English were certainly trying to become as French as possible . The Russians had become Americans , and the Americansbecome Russians . Before my first post-War visit to Paris , in the spring of 1923 , I decided again to visit America , and finally persuaded my wife to accompany me . Accordingly , we left together on the sixth of April , arriving in New York on the twelfth , and we sailed again for Europe on the nineteenth of May . Except for a brief visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time was now spent in New York itself , and gave me the effect of having seen only a cruder edition of the French capital . New York had by now grown hard-boiled and completely sophisticated , a spectacularcosmopolitan city of borrowed culture , able , thanks to its financial predominance , to attract all the celebrities and semicelebritiesof Europe into its orbit , and much more inclined to make something of them than of the native American product . It was an island of transplanted Europeans , anchored off the Atlantic coast , and ignoring the backwoods as completely as if that vast hinterland were occupied by none other than Red Indians . One could flourish in it , if one had unlimited impudenceor had acquired a European reputation ; but I had not taken sufficient care of my European reputation to be the kind of public figure New York then enjoyed . Indeed , the fact that I had lived in London and had not come to visit Paris since the Armistice worked as a handicap , as I soon discovered when a bright young intellectual working in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you live in London ? I could never understand how anyone could prefer living in London to living in Paris . It 's just as if someone said they preferred to live in Philadelphia to living in New York . " Personally , I felt , after my brief visit to Washington  --  it was the first time I had ever seen the American capital  --  that I would have preferred to live in Washington rather than in New York , if I could have discovered the remotest signs of any intellectual life there . Apparently , however , New York had drained from the provinces  --  for in those days all the states were only provinces of New York  --  their intellectual life to such an extent that the only alternatives open to the creative artist in America were either to move to Manhattan Island and endure the process of " sophistication , " or to face intellectual starvation in the backwoods . It was during this visit that I again encountered Edgar Lee Masters , who had come from Chicago finally to live in the midst of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across him at The Players , in Gramercy Park , and we had , I recall , a long talk together , during which I detailed to him my hopes of someday returning permanently to the United States . I have not forgotten his reply . He said : " Well , you have a choice of evils . You can either live here , where it is very expensive to live , and have some intellectual society , or you can bury yourself in the backwoods , where it is cheap , but where you will have no one to talk to above the intellectual level of the garage mechanic . " Such , as frankly expressed by Masters , was the creed of the New Yorker of those days . In New York I made certain new contacts , and renewed a few old ones , during the brief five weeks of my stay . I had already become interested in a new literary weekly called the Freeman which had unexpectedly printed , in September , 1922 , a flattering as well as an intelligent review of my life of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the editors , Van Wyck Brooks , a contemporary of mine at Harvard ( where I did not know him ) , whom I vaguely recalled meeting in the summer of 1913 in a restaurant in London . I had been stirred by his two early ventures in social and intellectual criticism , America 's Comingof Age and Letters and Leadership , which , appearing as they did in the War years , had seemed to me to state better and more honestly than any books I knew the actual hopes for maturity , as well as the moral dilemmas now facing America . I now sought him out , finding in him a finely balanced , generous , and sensitivep301son of New England , equally interested in Ike ! ; lime from the aesthetic as from the moral point of view , with a background of reading and study that proclaimed the scholar . I laid before him the proposition that I should become the English correspondent of the Freeman , only to find that though his fellow editors were interested in England , both socially and intellectually , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but wars , finance , and politics  --  had not yet penetrated to their minds . Nevertheless , Brooks took to me and I to him . He promised , since no one in the office of the paper knew much about poetry , and since poetry was still a matter for discussion , to let me review all the poetry books which came in ; and he was as good as his word . My connection with the Freeman lasted only for a year ; in the spring of 1924 the subsidy which had sustained the paper was withdrawn , and the Freeman vanished . But during that time I steadily wrote for the paper , not only on poetry , but occasionallyalso on other topics . And I was grateful to Brooks for the fact that the sums these articles brought enabled me better to make both ends meet , and also gave me a vent for my own critical opinions . The only other vent open to me at that time , or later , was in London , where T. S. Eliot founded his Criterion in this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never felt so free to express my own opinions as in the case of the Freeman . Although I had consistently admired Eliot 's poetry , I could see no direct connection between it and his critical opinions . As a poet he was a disabused romantic , a sophisticated ultramodern . As a critic he was an upholder of classicism and of tradition . It seemed to me that Brooks 's theory of literature ( which Professor Babbitt of Harvard , Eliot 's acknowledged master , would have dubbed sneeringly " romantic humanitarianism " ) agreed better with his practice as a writer than did Eliot 's , which was altogether too dependent on the accidents of his own purely personal and individualtaste . I frankly failed to see the connection between Eliot 's classicism and respect for tradition and the fact that his poetry was neither classical nor traditional , but the last word in modern experimentalism . While I was in New York I also renewed my acquaintance with Louis Untermeyer , now busily editing his American Poetry , A Miscellany , which had become the successor to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well of Miss Lowell , came to New York to look up material in the Morgan Library ) for her Keats book . At the time I did not realize that a Iasi glimpse it was ; in any case , I knew that Miss Lowell and I had traveled so far apart that it was useless for either of us to make any moves towards a renewal of friendship . She had published , in September of the preceding year , her great literary hoax , A Critical Fable . Conrad Aiken , who had by now come to live in England , had shown to me a copy and had spoken of it indignantly , and I was fully disposed to share his indignation . Miss Lowell was now forty-eight years old , the author of five solid books of poetry , each of which had been immediately successful , a successfultranslator of Chinese poetry , and a person in great demand as reader and lecturer . She was the maker of several great poetic reputations and of a host of smaller ones . She dominated her epoch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , poets or the mere public  --  who had the temerity to gainsay her . I had written , on receipt of her Critical Fable , saying that I thought she ought not to have published it , that it was poor sport for her to commit this kind of hoax ; and I had also gone to the trouble of defending Eliot against her aspersions . A Critical Fable had seemed to me totally lacking in either critical or in literary value . Its appearance , and still more the deliberate mystification of the public which had accompanied its bringing out , had shown it up once and for all for what it was  --  a mere advertising device , unworthy of its author 's , or of any author 's , name and reputation . Compared to the success of notoriety which my former friend and coworker in American poetry was achieving , Eliot 's rise in name and reputation in England , achieved at heavy mental and physical cost , was a thing to admire and respect , however much I differed from him . With the publicationof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henceforward , I felt indifferent . Though seeing her in New York , absorbed in her book on Keats , so little changed in appearanceor in style of dress from what she was when I first saw her in London , so much still the active eager student , still learning , still experimenting , so much and forever the practical woman of the world , I felt that Amy Lowell was to be pitied , not blamed , for having made her life what it was . I felt , as we sat together at the dinner table in the Hotel Belmont , that the intensive laborp303she was undertaking to finish her book on Keats would end by killing her ; and so , two years later , it did , under dramatic circumstances . By the end of May I had again returned to London , glad that I had been able to make renewed contacts with my own country in the company of my wife , and still more glad that the long and exhausting trip had been made without serious damage to her health . When I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eliot , who in that spring had brought out his Waste Land , that monumental landmark of post-War and personal disillusionment , which , to a degree greater than even the critics of that day surmised , brought to an effective close the ten years ' furore that had been made concerning the new poetry in America , and paved the way directly to a still newer poetry , which is still being written , discussed , and debated today , emerging this time from both sides of the Atlantic . I recall that Alfred Kreymborg , newly come to London that spring from Rome , after the daring and valuable experiment of his editorship on the magazine Broom  --  one of the first and probably the most important of the English-language journals that flourished on the Continent during those prohibition years  --  I recall that Kreymborg and I , in the presence of a London admirerof Eliot 's talent , sat down and read aloud together The Waste Land , taking alternate sections . Its blend of bitter realism and symbolic myth , of fierce Augustinian puritanism and magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made of it , I realized , not only another example of the new poetry such as had appeared in profusion during the past ten years , but , even more , a mark that other poets might shoot at and strive to emulate . The only objection I could make to it was one later voiced in my hearing by Havelock Ellis , to the effect that it was altogether too much of a pastiche from other poets . Eliot 's vivid keenness of poetic scholarship , his exact memory of what hundreds of other poets had written before him , seemed always on the point of stifling his own ability to originate , to create afresh , to advance into new poetic territory . The Waste Land , besides being much else , was also a battlefield between the claims of tradition and of Eliot 's individual talent , in which neither side decisively won , though possibly tradition was given an unconclusive and doubtful victory.  | Meditating on this poem , so completely akin in feeling to the disillusionment suffered by thousands who , like myself , had believed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequence of the War , and who were now already facing the manifest and dreadful possibility that European ' civilization would inevitably perish , I felt more and more akin to Eliot  --  though I shared little of the squeamish horror of sex which seemed to be manifest in his poem , or the desire to support my own poetry by references and quotations to dead-and-gone poets . I too , as he , had been through the War , had exiled myself , had been attracted alike to the Christian myth , though repelled by organized Christianity , had eventually come not to a land of promise and of fertile achievement , but to a barren waste land of disappointment and futility . Accordingly , early in 1924 , ten years after the outbreak of the War , I sat down and composed my own Waste Land in the shape of a poem , conceived as my " symphonies " had been conceived , in four sections , and entitled " Autobiography . " Into it I poured all my contempt and hatred for the age of speed , jazz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the War in Europe , no less than in America ; my longsustainedand abiding memory of the yet epic and unspoilt magnificence of the Mississippi Valley , as I had seen it , in 1915 ; my desperate waverings back and forth between Europe and my own country ; my feelings that love , in my own case , had slowly and inevitably become transformed to frustration ; my loneliness , followingupon my final abandonment by O'Brien and Cournos , who had been the two chief friends of the years immediately succeedingthe Armistice ; and my final protesting regret at the general course which life for me had taken . Thus this poem marked the end of my third , or religious , phase , as The Tree of Life had marked the end of the second , or aesthetic . ( In the first phase , the phase of the publication of my early volumes , I had been simply groping . ) The conclusion I reached at the close of this poem was unlike Eliot . Where he and his Waste Land had ended in a mass of disconnected fragments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that could finish only in whimpering hysteria and in the confession of complete defeat , my " Autobiography " strove to strike the note of a harder and starker , more stoic and more resolved , Anglo-Saxon paganismp305Maui did the gods make , Nature 's sole master ; Broad-browed and lordly , King of earth 's harvests . Many the gifts they gave to him , Much joy he won therefrom . He whom they abandon , Exile from their glory . Weak , puling , foolish , He strives to remember His kingdoms forgotten . Pitiful , lonelyLast remnant of man ! With him shall the gods not reckon ; Neither length of days , Nor lasting renown , Nor love requitedShall be his ... . Strive then no longer ; Waken or slumber , Labor or suffer , With your small day be content . Yet be at peace within your inner mind ; And you will findFar , far , beyond your loneliness and pain , Grey memories ripening under heavy rain.  |p306WAS  now beginning to feel , increasingly , the difficulties and obstaclesthat had come into my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was not without many friends in England . Indeed , the years between 1923 and 1927 were a period rich in such contacts . During that time I had so many friends there that I felt at home in England rather than anywhere else , and was more frequently in danger of losing all connection with America than at any earlier or later time . Foremost among my English friends I must set the figure of Eliot . Although he had not then taken the final step of becoming a British subject , had not flung down the challenge to his own age and country of proclaiming himself a " Royalist , an AngloCatholic , and a Conservative , " he was already English in appearance , English in the bent of his tastes , and English too largely in his mind . He had turned away from his own early background and upbringing , which  --  though it happened to occur at St. Louis  --  was entirely New England-minded , and had recovered , in England itself , a native East Anglianism of thought which I , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was sufficiently familiar with the English background to find its roots in seventeenth-century metaphysical poetry , and sufficientlydogmatic and uncompromising as well to realize that it would shake the tolerant English out of their post-War lethargy . Tall , pale , and distinguished-looking , Eliot 's slightly stooped figure attracted everyone  --  myself included  --  with its blend of conservativecaution and of calculated daring . I decided that he had the most brilliant mind of anyone I knew ; but it was a mind that in respect to the larger issues of life gave mainly negative results . My own tendency and direction had been far more pragmaticand provisional than his , and I could not , as he had done , " erect my personal impressions into universal laws . " His critical intelligence was more suited to an age of crisis than mine , since I was less the critic , and hoped to be more the creator . He now began to believe , as I did not , that a stern self/discipline of the mind , through adherence to some rigidly fixed tradition , was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To employ a phrase made later by G. K. Chesterton , he held that " the primary object of opening the mind , as of opening the mouth , was to close it again on something solid . " I , on the contrary , held that , in the chaos of modernity , all that the mind coulld do was to rely on itself , and gradually establish a largely personal and individual tradition . He now began to react against the American humanist group , under whose direction he had spent the years of his education , and to feel that the moral disciplinethey upheld as the goal of secular education could not he upheld by education  --  in short , he began to weaken in the direction of dogmatic religion . Thereby he not only set himself apart from Irving Babbitt and all his disciples , under whom he had grown to maturity , but also from the still commanding figure of Matthew Arnold , whose mind , in so many other respects , so much resembled the Gallic clarity of his own . I doubted whether Eliot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it was necessary , in my own case , to give a completeadherence to any established church , in order to continue to feel religious and even mystical . Dostoevski , to cite but one instance , had been not only highly religious , but highly heretical as regards all established religion . Vincent Van Gogh , in whose mind I now became more and more interested , had lived a magnificently religious life , and had remained a complete skeptic , for reasons entirely unconnected with his occasional lapses into insanity . And men like William Blake and Friedrich Nietzsche had followed a similar course . Like these , I preferred to remain a heretic , an outlaw from the churches , feeling that it was necessary for the churches first to revise their dogmas , rather than for me to accept what I could not believe literally . As for Eliot 's remark that in respect to acceptance of dogma , it was a case of " the spirit killeth , but the letter giveth life , " I rejected it altogether . Apart from this widely divergent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I found Eliot 's mind both interesting and stimulating . He displayed an extraordinary acuteness , not , indeed , in his analysis of the general relation of literatureto life , or of culture to religion , or of emotion to its resultant in art , but in his discussion of individual writers ,  |p3o8  individual styles , and individual phases of artistic cleat ion . Thus , he had been practically first among the expatriate Americans of his generation to see and to stress the significance of Donnie , that self-tormented and overwhelmingly cerebral genius in whom the medieval urge to otherworldliness , and the pride of the Renaisancesecular learning , had fought their long duel to the death . I le had been the first to see the connection between the post-War age of abstract mathematical and logical speculation on the one hand , and of revived racial and national hatreds on the other , with just such a period as the seventeenth century of religious wars and of Spinoza , Descartes , Newton , Milton , and the metaphysical poets . He had tried to rebuild an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not see how it could be done , believing that romanticism had already , whether for good or ill , too deeply marked mankind  --  as well as Eliot himself  --  with its restless longings for the impossible and the infinite , for its work to be undone ; but I honored and admired his attempt . He was extremely kind to me , permitting me even to upholdSpengler 's entirely mystical and probably thoroughly unscientificthesis of race consciousness  --  which finally landed Spengler in the Nazi fold  --  against his own friend Wyndham Lewis , and also to take a fling at I. A. Richards 's too dryly scientific concepts of the functions of language , in the columns of his periodical . As an editor , I found him to be practically ideal , willing for opinions to be mooted that ran contrary to his own avowed toryism , so long as those opinions were not merely emotionalprejudices , but were backed up by something resembling intellectual judgment . In a way , this refusal on his part to insist on any general agreement among his contributors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less a coherent body of doctrine , than a number of assembled but divergent minds , each approaching a problem from a limited angle motivated by some intense intellectual attraction or antipathy . Critically speaking , every one of his contributors was brilliant , but , like Eliot himself , they indulged only too frequently in the " criticism of criticism . " This soon made their weekly luncheon discussions which they at first attended , and their own occasional monthly dinner reunions which followed , sufficiently tiresome affairs ; allp309were  --  so eager to disprove each other that few dared say anything at all to the purpose . High among Eliot 's contributors stood the Yorkshireman , Herbert . Read , whose dryly exact cast of mind , pawky sense of humor , and taciturn habits of speech made his opinions much sought after . He had emerged from the War with a high British decoration , and with the instinctive semipagan , semimystical fatalism of the born soldier . Read was , in consequence perhaps of his War experiences , ever careful in those years to conceal the romantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been carefully excised from his poetry , and only occasionally appeared in his prose . But I saw enough of him to realize that he remainedan unbeliever , despite his association with Eliot , in the official dogmas of Christianity , and that he had leanings towards political and economic radicalism . Having discovered further that he considered beauty of equal , if not superior , value to mankind , as either goodness or truth , I was convinced that he was , in fact , a disguised romantic , and in this I was not mistaken . There were also to be seen at the Criterion lunches and dinners , Harold Monro , now graying and aging , as taciturn in his own way as Read , writing poems in which a pathetic sincerity of spirit often scored effects as good as the most elaborate technique ; F. S. Flint , getting even vaguer and more ineffectual with the falling years ; the eager , lyrical , likable Richard Church , who was my special friend ; the tolerant , witty , and friendly Bonamy Dobree , whose special subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all interesting in their own way ; and yet I , hearing them talk , doubted whether some of my earliest friends in London had not talked with more verve and originality . For across them all lay the renewed tensions and rifts of the post-War world  --  Europe , rent to pieces by revivified nationalistic hatreds , and slowly perishing , while the alien lights of America and of Russia , on either side , seemingly rose higher and higher . The " Criterion gang " was not the sole group with whom I had links in London . Through them I became acquainted with two daring young spirits of the War years at Cambridge University , I. A. Richards and C. K. Ogden , who had caused considerable stir by publishing , despite the activities of the censorship , their Cambridge Review , which was as critical of the Allies ' aims as it had been of the Germans ' during the years i g 14-18 , and who had gone thence into the question of aesthetics , the relationship of the human imagination to scientific reality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " These two men provided an instructivecontrast . Richards , lean , dark , saturnine , and reserved , had buried himself in scholarly research , was engaged in the task of proving , by means of strict logical analysis , the validity of great literature and imaginative creation . Ogden , rotund , bespectacled , smiling with the benevolence of a Mr. Pickwick , was swimming happily and pragmatically along the stream of the world , his fingers deep in the pie of a large London publishing house , and was now absorbed in passing out contracts right and left for his popular and amusing series of small booklets , " Today and Tomorrow . " It was through Ogden that my Parables were published , and I shall never forget the day when he appeared before me , in the office of a London literary weekly for which I then occasionally wrote , and with his overcoat pockets bulging deep with books and manuscripts smilingly passed out to me a contract , after an examination of my manuscript that must have been extremely perfunctory . I had never had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment I did not know whether Ogden was merely joking . This happy disciple of Jeremy Benthamand the Utilitarians was , I concluded , a real philanthropist ; and his later invention of " Basic English " has shown to the world that Ogden will always run true to form . My artist acquaintances were now not less important than my literary ones . They comprised the ex-American , McKnight Kauffer , who had come from Chicago to London and become the most discussed and best paid poster artist in London ; another ex-American , Jacob Epstein , whom I had met in the days before the War , long before he became a sculptor of sensational notoriety , and whom I saw only infrequently ; and Leon Underwood , who had emerged from the War to establish an informal but brilliantly creative art school which functioned for a few years at his own studio near Hammersmith , and where everything was practiced in turn from modern white-line woodcuts to sculpture and painting . The only American among my artist friends who was not permanently a resident of London was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deserves a few paragraphs to himself , as providing me , during those years , with one of the chiefp311links that enabled me to keep up my connections with my own country . During my visit to New York in the summer of 1920 , I had been invited by an enterprising bookseller-publisher of Green- Village to an evening party in the rooms above his establishment . When I arrived a numerous collection of people had already gathered . I was introduced by my host to a few of them , and we all sat down and consumed iced drinks and talked , while the heat of the evening drifted in and out of the open windows . I had just begun a conversation with Gaston Lachaise , a sculptor of whom I had only recently heard , when a man , whom Lachaise introduced to me as Rockwell Kent , came over and somewhat brusquely interrupted our conversation . Our talk , which had previously hinged about the relation of realism to abstract form in sculpture , was now diverted by Kent into a narrative of his own exploits as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself and went over to the other side of the room , where a man was sitting alone who , in appearance , I judged , was the handsomest specimen of Homo sapiens present . With a well-rounded oval head , bright blue eyes , and a challenging and yet open expression on his face , he was apparently waiting for someone to approach him . In a moment I had introduced myself to him , and had learned his name in turn ; and so I came to know John J. A. Murphy . Murphy had grown up among the same Catholic Irish in Boston who had produced O'Brien . He had insisted , despite the opposition of his puritanically-minded parents , on going to art classes in that city , and during the years when I myself was makingmy first steps towards establishing myself as a poet , had come to London , where he worked from 1913 to 1916 in Frank Brangwyn'sstudio at Hammersmith , acting there as general assistant to the most popular and successful artist-decorator of the day . He had thus undergone the selfsame apprenticeship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great artists of the Italian Renaissance ; and it had left him with a fund of amusing anecdotes about Brangwyn , his methods of work , his dependence on his pupils , his refusal to think beyond the immediate tasks of his day , and his fringe of hangers-on , apprentices , and frank imitators , which was inexhaustible . In Murphy 's hands Brangwyn became a figure out of one of Vasari 's Lives  --  a strange blend of artist- prince , hermit , and shrewd , nioneygrubbing peasant . Murphy 1i:1 ( 1 escaped from under Brangwyn 's wing in the end , taking withhim an exact and detailed knowledge of woodcutting , etching , and all printing processes , and had gone to Paris , where he had been caught up by the War and by matrimony . He had there begun to emerge as a brilliant white-line woodcutter . He had come back to America after the Armistice and had established himself in New York . But two years after our first meeting there , he returned to London and lived throughout 1922-23 in a studio @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-man show of his woodcuts  --  the first of its kind  --  at the Leicester Galleries early in 1923 . He now introduced me to no less a person than Campbell Dodgson , keeper of the Print Room at the British Museum , and editor of the Print-collector 's Quarterly . Thus it came about that , through Murphy , I resumed my work , interrupted since the appearance of my book on Gauguin , as a writer on art topics , leadingoff with an article about his own woodcuts . I became again , through this contact , an art critic in the special field of the modern white-line woodcut ; but unlike so many critics of that day and hour , I did not concern myself with the abstract development of modern art that had come through cubism , but preferred to confine my discussions of both woodcutters and woodcutsto those who had remained fundamentally representational . Indeed , all these cubists , futurists , dadaists , and surrealists of the post-War years seemed to me  --  and still seem  --  to regard art even more illogically than the confirmed academicians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but still more to advance , is not and can not be made either a direct and photographic imitation of reality , or a mathematical dissection and rearrangementof realty . It is in fact reality selected , heightened , restated in its salient characteristics , adapted to a given material , and made thereby into a new and independent creation . The work of art , by its very nature , partakes of both abstraction and of direct emotional sympathy ; and the artist , in creating it , both makes and contemplates his creation , as the Bible tells us God is able to do . Such an artist as Picasso , for example , with his immense technical resources , his vast intellectual capacity , has never yet faced the complex of intellectual and emotional processes whichp313results in a personal style . Ile has literally never learned how to create anything . Ile has but shifted front manner to manner , from phase to phase , without acquiring a single thing that may he called permanently rooted in common experience , and yet , undoubtedly , his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his precursor Cezanne  --  an artist without style ; for the secret of any style lies in the creative grasp of any given subject matter and material , and not in its visible rearrangement into new aspects . Picasso 's work , literally , is an attempt at creation from the void . It is remarkable from the point of view of its observational knowledge , but from the point of view of its degree of feeling and meaning , its ability to induce that participation mystique , which , according to anthropologists , is the basis of all primitive art and religion , it has nothing to offer . In this it is akin to the literary art of one of Picasso 's earliest discoverers , the exAmericanGertrude Stein . I had met Miss Stein in Paris as early as 1913 , had read some of her work in a magazine then published by Alfred Stieglitz , and I was not ready  --  nor am I ready now  --  to accord to her the epithet of " genius . " Murphy , in his life and work , made an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entirely the calm , self-contained craftsman , catholic only in the sense that all men are catholic , planning each step in life and art well in advance , and constructing his work according to well-laid-out logical formulas ; the other , nervous , dynamic , irritable , contemptuousof all fixed dogmas , forever jumping from one experimentto another , a mine of ideas , good , bad , and ridiculous . It was through two such divergent temperaments as these , both working in the restricted field of the modern white-line woodcut  --  thoughI later came to know of other instances of divergence , such as the artists Paul Nash and Eric Gill  --  that I came to be aware of the fearful chaos and disorder of the twentieth century , just as apparent now in the art world as in the field of literature , economics , politics , and religion . It was at this time that I first heard of Spengler , and obtained the original German text , strugglingthrough most of its two volumes before the English translationappeared . Spengler was ready with an explanation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all-inclusive and devastating than Henry Adams 's . According to his creed , there had been exactly nine great culture periods iii the world : Egyptian , Mesopotamian , East Indian , Chinese , Hellenistic , Roman , Magian , Faustian , and Aztec-Mayan , each being distinct from the other , and each representing different varieties of race consciousness . Each  --  excepting the Aztec-Mayan , which was cut oil just as it stood at the point of its highest possible **25;4853;TOOLONG the successive stages of tribalism , feudalism , nationalism , and fusion of state and religious cult into a single Caesaristic , imperialistic scheme , which gradually petrified into the end term of all culture , which was what we called modern civilization . Then came the breakup and the return to chaos through a revival of otherworldly religion , leading on to a new cycle of culture in areas where the primary urge for race consciousnesshad not yet been exhausted or fully developed . Europe , in Spengler 's view , had already reached the final point where only the Caesaristic state and the petrification of forms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come from the European area , dominated by Faustian man . It must come from such inchoate and as yet " unripened " regions of culture as Russia and the United States of America . As a late European , born three centuries too late to see the highwaterpoint of European culture , Spengler was forced to throw in his lot with the Caesaristic state of the future . But it might be still open to Americans and to Russians to make another choice . My reading of Spengler , together with my own feeling that it was only in America that I could find full freedom for my own creative energy , caused me to regret more and more deeply the circumstances that still kept me tied to England . In the last weeks of January , 1925 , my wife and I left London for a holiday abroad , this time turning our steps towards Italy . Under a new treatment which she was now taking , Daisy 's health was considerably improving ; but she had been so ill every winter of the last four years that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Moreover , I was now intensely curious to see for myself how Italy was faring under Benito Mussolini , the first of the Caesars whose advent on the European stage Spengler had accurately predicted . I must admit that I not only went to Italy in a spirit disposed to be critical of Mussolini and of all the achievements of fascism , but that I came away favorably impressed.  |p315The  first fora weeks of our stay , till newly the close of February , were spent between Portofino and Rapallo , on that lovely Ligurian Riviera lying south of Genoa , which I had never before seen , and which had so inspired Friedrich Nietzsche . ' Whether it was the association with Nietzsche 's memory or the welcome release from London 's dismal fogs , frosts , and damps that requickened me , I do not know ; but the halcyon calm of that enchanted coast , guarded by great snow peaks , with its profusion of ilexes , myrtles , olives , and mimosas crowding down to the blue waters of the lazy Mediterranean , softened the grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the machine age and supernationalism quite bearable . Even Daisy , who had never before been on the Continent , forgot her hypochondriaand enjoyed the cosmopolitan crowd at our hotel , spending her days sketching outdoors with the avidity of a child . At the end of February we went on to Florence , spending two weeks there in the still chilly and bleak upland of Tuscany , and from thence descended to Rome , a place full of happy memories for me , for in it , long ago , in the winter of 1908-09 , I had first grown intimately familiar with Keats , Shelley , Byron , and the English romantics , had spent hours pensively musing on the relics of Rome 's vanished greatness , and had been alternately absorbed and repelled by the pomp and ceremonial , the dogmaticformalism , and the reactionary excesses of Catholicism . Unfortunately , these happy memories were not to be recovered , for on the first day of our arrival a telegram announcing that both of the young people we had left behind in London were ill recalled us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my " Cycle of Liguria " ( later incorporated in The Black Rock ) completed , five poems , two of them in symphonic form , dedicated to Columbus and to Nietzsche , and three others , in which salient features of the Riviera landscape were used as symbols to describe phases of existence and dominating characteristics of the Mediterranean mind . This series , I thought , served as a sublimation of my own maturer ideas concerning life and death , human ambition and pioneering , in action and in thought , as well as the earlier and longer series of the " symphonies " had served to express more aesthetic and less reflective reactions . The poems it **27;4880;TOOLONG Toot toot tootsie , good-by . Celia saw Rudy Valentino in Blood and Sand .

Alvin saw himself as Anatol , the Viennese lover , suave , debonair , sipping love lightly , tasting all varieties of women , sipping their love like a connoisseur in wines . Nobody lied when they said that I cried over you .. . . The American printed a picture of McCormick just after his monkey-gland operation . It was said he was now going to marry an opera singer . Though Mitch Wilner told everybodymonkey glands were a lot of hooey . Just because you 're you , that 's why I love you ... . A fellow was found in a vacant lot on the South Side . He was bleeding , and his glands were gone . , lort Abramson said if a thing like that happened to him he 'd commit suicide .

Alvin Fox took Sylvia Abramson to the opera at Ravinia , trying to impress her , and parking by the roadside said : " Have you any suppressed desires ? " That was his line . But it did n't work with her . The sexy , the wildest generation , the kids who did badthings at country clubs  --  say , what 's a country club ? What is love ? When a girl gives herself to a fella . Would I give myself to him ? That 's how you tell . Oh , there 's just no place for love . No nice girl does it in a car .

Lou Green fumbled with himself , worriedsomebody might catch him at it . The guys said girls did it too . It 's love that makes the world go round . At Kelley 's Stables they scratched their names on the wall , put their gin in ginger ale ( fifty cents a glass ) , threw pennies at the singing waiter , and , dancing on the tiny square of floor , the girls rubbed . bellies with the fellows .

There was a literary conversation between Mort Abramsonand Alvin ( the Duke ) Fox : Motu : Did you read the God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( scornfullv ) : Say , that 's about as modern as Uncle Tom 's Cabin . I bet thev paid the cops to suppress it for a publicity stunt . You want to read something good ? Read Jurgen . Mort ( excitedly ) : Say , I heard of that ! Can you get me a copy ? ALVIN : Well , a friend of mine up at the U had it but I do n't know if I can get in touch with hint . MoRT : It 's pretty hot stuff , I heard . ALVIN : Well , Jurgen is really literature . I ca n't get interested in a book just for its pornographic aspect but when it 's got sonic literary merit that 's different . Cabell is the greatest living author next to Anatole France.  |p203MORT  : I do n't know about that . What about Jacob Wassermann . Did you read World 's Illusion ? That part where the guy gets the girl Ruth , in the basement , and tells her he 's going to rape her ? ALVIN : Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but on the whole I do n't think Wassermann comes up to Cabell . MORT : Say , I heard there was a place downtown where you could buy Frank Harris 's Life and Loves . ALVIN : He wants fifteen bucks for it but I know a guy that rents out a copy . Mohr : Yah ? Have you read it ? ALVIN : I do n't think so much of it from a literary standpointbut in some ways it 's better than Fanny Hill , the classic . MORT : How much does this guy charge ? ALVIN : A dollar a day . MoRT : That 's not such a had business . ALVIN : I was thinking of going into it myself up at the U. You ought to get it and read that part about the Negress .

Say , Mort , did you ever see a copy of Lysistrata , with the Aubrey Beardsley illustrations ? .. . MORT ( to himself ) : A buck a day . I would n't put it past the Duke to be getting a rake-off from this guy , whoever he is . And , about I a.m. , in bed , Mort was reading the part where this young Negro girl , W'ho Wanted to show her gratitude to Frank Harris for a favor , asked her mother what was the best thing a girl could do to give a man pleasure . After her mother told her , this beautiful young Negro girl cane up to Frank Harris 's place , and -- Mort sensed the door opening , tentatively . He just had time to slide the book under his pillow . " I thought maybe you fell asleep with the light on , " said his mother , glancing around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could see there was nothing to read . " I  --  I was thinking , " Mort said crossly . His blood was pounding . For a moment he had been afraid it was Sylvia . Did she have to tuck him in ? Could n't he have any pri-vacy ? " What do you have to think about , in the middle of the night ? " his mother said , lightly . " Ca n't you let me alone ? " he snapped . " What do you think I am , a kid ? " She gave him a quick , hard look , shrugged , and went out . When Sol awoke after sleeping for twenty-two hours , Estelle was by his bedside . His mother shuffled in and out of the room . It was all right for a girl to conic into his bedroom because he was sick . And vet it gave Sol an excited feeling . The whole roost seemed to smell of being in bed , this bed he had wanted her in , and part of hint scented still to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into some infancywhere there was a smell like the warm dew on a woman 's breast all around him , the saute but different scent he had caught upon Estelle 's young breasts , sometimes when they were necking heavy ; and part of hint even scented to be with his mother way back when she used to sing . He wanted to lower himself back into sleep , and Estelle would be here all the time . His mother pulled up the shade , and the alley-light came in and rested on the brass ends of the bed , making pencils of light on each post.  | " You nitwit , you would go and crash when I was n't even around to see it ! " Estelle greeted him . " Say , I could have lasted it but that lousy partner I had --  " " Sure , if you had a good partner you would have placed . " " Do me a favor , will you ? " he mumbled . " Call up NickPisano . " " Say , he better not come near here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Tell him I 'm okay . " Even through his sleep he had felt his mother 's ceaseless grumbling : " Fifty dollars a day ! Fortunes he 's making ! That devil-tongued Italian , may his eves . be torn out of his head ! A hundred dollars for a packing box to sleep in ! And what has he left , my hero ? Doctor bills , and a broken leg ! Fine ! Better he should be a cripple for life than a bicycle rider . ... " " Oh , she do n't mean it , she 's just glad you 're all right , " Estelle said . " Did they bring my bikes home ? " " Pisano is taking care of them . She would have given them to the junk man . " The old lady was out of the room . Estelle gave him a long cool kiss , different from the kisses when they were necking ; at the same time he felt her breasts against him almost as though she were in bed . Oh , this was gon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time . Oh , boy ! " Here , you wan na eat something . " His mother came back , with a tray . " I 'll feed him , " Estelle said . This was the wav you learned Who were your friends , all right , when you were flat on your- back in bed . The two Lous came , stood around , and kidded him , and Runt Plotkincame around and said it was a shame , he could n't even get damages for a thing like that , and I larry Perlin camep206around , and a lot of girls called up , but Estelle was there almost all the time , answering the phone , and could she give them the ice ! On Sunday , Sol awoke with a suddenly fresh , rested feeling . He forgot his ankle . Then he knew why he felt so good The folks were going riding with the old lady 's brother . He and the redhead would have the place to themselves . When Estelle came over , Ben was still around , the dope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ben , " Estelle said sweetly . " I 'll take care of the invalid . " He gave them a look , and said he 'd take in a show . " Alone at last , huh ? " Sol said . Even the little flat in back of the store had a Sunday cleanliness . Estelle sat on the edge of the bed and fed him bits of fudge she had made . All the while they hardly spoke , and their touching of bodies ryas stiff , wary , as though they were strangers sizing each other up . His hand fastened on her arm . " Hey , kid , lie down here for a while beside me . " " What for ? " The shrillness of her own voice brought her back to herself . Why , she was acting like a baby . She knew Sol . Mc was so cute , the way he was angling for her . The way his body was kind of limp and yet she could feel the strength of his arms . " Aw , it 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to make his voice sound innocent . With a quick movement , she stretched on the outside of the covers . He began working his arts under her , and finally , while they were having a long gluey kiss , he pulled the sheet from between them , and let it fall over her , too . Her dress would get wrinkled . She kicked off her slippers . What if she did let it happen ? Laver since she had started going with fellows , she had been curious : what would thep207fellow be like ? Hints , suggestions she had caught . Some men were good at it , and some no good at all . Oh , Sol would be good . But she had never imagined they would do it like this . Not in a back bedroom with the shade raised and you could see the alley . She ought to get up and pull the shade but that would mean she intended to go the whole way . She would n't go the whole way , but just lie there peacefully as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let him do it . She was a nice girl even if she was kind of promiscuous about necking , her mother would go crazy if she did a thing like this . So what ? What had her mother got out of life ? Her dopy mother , the way she had acted up that time she bobbed her hair . What if it was here in the back bedroom , it was kind of honest and sweet , this was the way he lived , and was her own house so swell ? Why make a pretense about everything ? Why not be yourself ? And then , under his clumsily wily , groping hands , feeling the yearning and the torture and at the same time the worshipand tenderness of his hands , and feeling herself knowingthis kid so well , this kid that just wanted to ride a bike , be a great six-day bike rider and be a fine Jewish athlete who saved his dough , like Benny Leonard , make lots of dough and have girls send him mash notes  --  oh , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love sensationsthat swept up and down her body , she thought : maybe she would let him . And then , he had lurched over , and there was a confusion of pain , and neither of them knowing quite how , and just as suddenly he lurched away from her . Was that all ? Had they done it ? And then , coupled with a kind of pity for him , she felt a low , sinking , deathly disappointment in herself : they had muffed it , and for this clumsy tangle she had lost  --  what ? Aw , it 's nothing , I 'm no different ! she thought . And yet , resist it as she would , the idea drove down upon her that now she was different , now she was like something that had been perfect but was scratched ; she seemed to see her mother 's reviling face looking down at her and looking away , looking down at her and looking away .. . Aw , bushwah ! she wanted to yell . Baloney ! It 's all a lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of what the fellows said , a woman is like a car ; a slightly used car that has been broken in by a good driver is better than a new car , any time . Then the other fellow always asked the first fellow : But would you marry a girl that had had it before ? And the first fellow always hesitated . And she wanted to laugh . Now she felt superior . Now she felt as though she could run her life to suit herself . And her mother looking down at her ! Go on , look , what can you see ? Scared ? She had been more scared that time after she gother hair bobbed . Anybody could see bobbed hair ! A Jewish girl ! A Jewish girl does n't do such things ! Oh me oh my ai ai ai ! Poof. fly daughter should do such a thing ! Raised in a good Jewish house , my daughter . . . Estelle sat up in bed , and shook her hair hard , so she could feel the clusters swish against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it would be like this , a brass bed , and bars of sunlight on the rods . So now she was started . It was kind of comical . And Solly was so sleepy , his head lolled heavily over the other way . So now she was a bad girl . Ishkabibble ! He turned , and looked at her with moonish , loving eyes , that nevertheless carried , way down , a spark of belligerency . " You 're not sorry , are you ? " he got out.  |p209Estelle  passed her hand over his face . The poor sweet kid ! Everything Is PerfectThere is all kinds of perfection . Sometimes we speak of a perfect moment , when the surroundings , the company , the things being done , blend into a perfect whole , into something that seems to have a meaning beyond itself , expanding and multiplying until it is the way of life of the whole universe . Like Harry Perlin said , watching the beautiful new Cadillacthat a customer drove into the garage , a new car is perfectuntil the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smashed fender later . To Mort Abramson a girl was something perfect , until she had been had . A way of doing something may be perfect ; all summer AlvinFox raved about Louis Wolheim 's acting in The Hairy Ape ; that was perfect , he said ! Runt Plotkin told of a stunt pulled by Rube Moscowitz . After wrecking an old sewage plant , the city of Chicago had about fifty thousand dollars ' worth of junk for sale . All the junkyards in town were hungry to bid on that stuff . This was one lot Rube Moscowitz was n't going to get away from them , because there was a law that the city had to advertise for bids on any transaction over five hundred dollars . So how did Rube Moscowitz fix it with the politicians ? They divided the fifty thousand dollars ' worth of junk into lots worth a few hundred dollars each , and sold it all , lot by lot , to the Moscowitz junkyard ! No other dealer had a lookin ! " That was perfect ! " said Runt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ running for Congress , that was perfect ! And Henry Ford for President.  |p2I0  Just because you 're you , that 's why I love you ... . Joe Freedman and Sylvia Abramson had perfect hours in the studio Joe had fixed in the basement the Big Ten had used as a clubroom . It was so cool there , and in the late afternoons Sylvia would sit reading poetry while Joe modeledher head . It was modern poetry : Carl Sandburg . If both the Sox and the Cubs won their pennants , and that 's what it looked like to Lou Green , that would be perfect ! It had n't happened since 1909 . Ev Goldberg was going steady with a full-fledged lawyer ! One day the girls felt that their unity was perfect . Their Sunshine Club was having a mall jong party at Celia 's to raise their five-dollar monthly pledge for their Belgian war orphan . Skinny Heller had n't showed up .

" And it was Lil Klein who noticed that now every one of them had a bob ! It gave them a funny , lumpy , perfect feeling of being together . Skinny explained how she had finally got the bob . Just for something to do in summer , she had a filing job with S. W. Straus . And the company had two girls ' baseball teams , long hairs and short hairs . I hey had just played a challenge game . The long hairs lost and had to bob their hair ! Even though Skinny was n't on the team , she had been swept along to the shop , and before she knew it --  " It 's marvelous ! " Aline exulted . " It 's perfect ! " In the study of law you often get cases where a whole chain of whereases fit into each other as perfectly as a set of Chinese boxes and , at other times , there is a logical distinctionthat is beautiful.  |p211Lou  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preiss . Lou asked , what ' is the difference between calling a man a Jew , and calling a man a bugger ? It 's like the difference between larceny and robbery , or between a civil and a criminal offense . You might insult a man by calling him a Jew , but you might injure him by calling him a bugger . Get it ? He liked to tell it , for it was a perfect distinction . It was a perfect summer . Sometimes Mitch took an hour off for a walk in Jackson Park with Joe , listening to Joe go into ecstasies about his favorite piece of architecture , the crumbling old Fine Arts building . He said it lay like a great bird with spread wings upon the ground . Joe was off the Gothic stuff now , only the classical stuff was perfect ; in fact he was leaving the Midway studio and going down to the school of architecture at Urbana . Mitch kind of liked the decay of the crumbling walls , but Joe said it would be a crime if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to Mitch 's room . His life was really efficient this summer , in this cubicle of a dorm room , with the mission study table , the goosenecked lamp , the hard narrow bed , and the bare yellow walls . This was the life . Joe sprawled on Mitch 's cot , . his head cupped in his interlockedfingers . Mitch was raving about a prof of his , that Russian , Vakhtanov , who had escaped from the Bolsheviki . " He was a big man in Russia , " Mitch said . " These dopes here do n't even listen to him , but he 's got sonic wonderful theories . For instance , we do n't know a damn thing about blood . " " Yah ? " Joe did n't raise his head . " Everybody 's looking for germs , " Mitch said scornfully . " Every day they 've got serums for t.b . or they 've discovered the cancer germ . But let Inc tell you , they do n't even know what happens in the blood , and that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot of complicated chemical reactions ... "  |p2I2Joe  half listened . He liked the earnest excited sound of Mitch , lecturing like a full-fledged medico. " ... so look , you cluck , I 'll put it simply . Maybe even you can understand . You 're an architect . So the human body is a city . The veins and the arteries are the streets and alleys , and the bloodstream is the traffic bringing stuff to the cells , taking away waste . " " Ah , Venice ! " said Joe . " All right , Venice . Now in the body you have factories where certain necessary products are made , like the liver and the spleen and the different organs ; then you have warehouseswhere stuff is stored  --  see , all this stuff travels along the arteries from factory to warehouse to consumer . Supposeyour brain tissue needs a little more fat --  " Joe snorted . " It 's like an endless conveyor system , running through the streets , and into the houses , along the hallways , and every cell is a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what he wants off the conveyor , and shuts the door . Only there is n't any man and there is n't any door . The cell has some way of dragging this stuff out of the bloodstream and pulling it right through the cell Wall , yet keeping it inside so it ca n't get back out through that same wall . To make brains , to make bones , to make fingernails , each cell knows what compoundsit needs , and gets them out of the bloodstream , see ? How does it work ? How come all that perfect organization ? Where does the cell get that selectivity ? I low the heck , with the thousands of varieties of molecules floating along in the bloodstream , how does each individual cell , each particle of tissue , how does it know . . ?

Like that time last summer , walkingtogether on the beach , under the country stars . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the feeling thep213city gave him , this same feeling Mitch was trying to express ; sometimes the utterly inapprehensible complication of the city seized upon Joe : the wonder of street after street of houses , of people going in , coming out , carrying packages , of trucks going to stores , dumping goods to be pieced away by people who came to the stores on the street car , El , bus , from Devon Avenue , from Dorchester to Crawford , from Lawndale to Clark Street , who knew just where to buy victrolarecords , sacks of flour , Chinese lanterns ; sometimes it seemed to him that if this maze of people on the way from one place to another and people eating and people pulling levers were suddenly to be stopped , arrested in motion , the whole thing would be seen to be an amazing , perfectly balancedpattern , every movement would be traceable from its source to its destination , and it would be obvious that the whole life of the city was at any one moment a different , but perfectly composed and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet you would n't discover what you were looking for , but you would be choked with wonder at the perfection with which all these interrelated motifs came to balance . And maybe that was what Mitch meant . Joe circled his arm along the bed , sat up , and for an instant stared straight into Mitchell 's earnest brown eyes . They had a feeling of perfect friendship . " What are these mattresses made of ? " Joe said . " Wood ? " Be YourselfThat semester Sam Eisen could n't arrange his courses any other way but that his gym hour cants just heft ire his drill hour . The gym was a mile away front the armory . Once , as he was rushing out of the gym , a puttee carte loose . " Balls ! " He was late for drill already .

And on the next drill day , as Sam was walking toward the armory , gripy and discontented , he remembered that peacefulhour , when he had skipped R.O.T.C. Why go to drill ? Eyes left , eyes right . Hup . Mark time , march . Mark time , march . Mark time . Fix bayonets ! And what was there to this college life , for him , alto-gether ? Rushing to get through a pile of greasy dishes to get some food to shove down his throat and then rush over to a class on the Nineteenth-Century Poets . To sit around with a gang at the Mosi Over , eyes left when a pair of nifty ankles passed , eyes right when a couple of gigglers took the next table .

Once he had been fascinated by all that . A battered hat , a pullover sweater , a pair of tweed knickers ; wished he could make himself over in that image . But latelv he felt like a fool . Eyes left . Mark time . Mark time . Like that- time with the fellows in the Big Ten . But he had busted out , then , given them hell . Maybe he had only made a fool of himself . He remembered the puzzled , vacant stares of Harry Perlin , Mitch Wilncr . Yet , he had felt better , after that . And suddenly , Sam thought : why do anything he did n't want to do ? He would never fight in anv war , so why should he learn to fix bayonets ?  |p215He  turned back to his room . And he had a wonderful feeling , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get along , just being honest with himself ; and he told himself that later , in seriouslife , he must remember this fact every time the crowd started to get him away from himself . The dean of men had a square red face ; he looked like a gentleman farmer . Sam Eisen closed the door behind him , and walked to the desk . This was the dean famous all over the country for the wav he handled fellows who got into scrapes . " ' Mr. Eisen ? " " Yes . " The dean waved Sam to a heavy leather chair . The dean tilted against a windowsill , and took a frank , estimating look at Sam . He tapped a card against his palm . " Well , I suppose you know what it 's about ? " " R.O.T.C. ? " " Lieutenant Russell tells me you received several notices but you failed to show up . " " That 's right , " Sam said . " Mmm hmm .

Well , Mr. Eisen , suppose you tell me just why you have decided to drop your military drill ? " " I do n't believe in compulsory R.O.T.C. , " Sant said promptly . And added : " I do n't believe in war . " " I see . " The dean slowly brought his chair down to the floor . His manner became friendlier than ever ; he etas use one of those fine modern parents ' r ho do n't talk down to their children . " I guess nobody believes in war , " the dean said . " I do n't know how much faith we can put in treaties , but you know they 're working on it in Washington right now . I expect great things from the Disarmament Conference . I think history will regard it as one of the turning points . Have you been following it ? " " Well , just a little in the papers , " Sam said . Maybe he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was just another one of those political bunk parties . " I think the leading statesmen of America and Europe feel just as you feel about war , and are sincere in their attempt to eliminate it , do n't you ? " " That may be very true , " Sam said , beginning to catch on , " but --  " " Was someone in your family in the war ? An older brother ? " " No , " said Sam . " Nobody . " " You arrived at this conviction yourself , then ? " " Yes , " said Sam . While momentarily , into his mind , crowded pictures seen in the paper : ex-soldiers standing in breadlines ; and signs : " Give a Soldier a Job " ; and in a war movie the earth exploding , with arms , legs , helmets arching among the clods of flying dirt ; and the futility , the destructionpictured in that book he had read : Three Soldiers . And it seemed to him that he was here , not because he had accidentallystarted slipping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of revolt against the vile wrongs on earth . " Well , now , I do n't have to tell you the R.O.T.C. was not instituted as a militaristic measure , " the dean said . " We could get into a long argument here about self-defense but that 's really beside the point . The is here by governmentorder , and there 's no alternative . You sec , Eisen , this thing is really not up to me . It 's up to you . We believe when a man gets to the University he 's old enough to think and act for himself . ( Oh , yeah ? ) Now , the R.O.T.C. is a part of the state university . You knew it was here . What it amounts to is a gentleman 's agreement --  " Uhuh . Springing the gentleman stuff.  | " On the one hand , the state gives you an education . On the other hand , you sacrifice a few hours to military drill . It 's healthful , why , most of the fellows enjoy it . " " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea --  " " Well , you could have gone to a school where R.O.T.C. is optional . " " I could n't afford the tuition . " The dean pursed his lips . " Well , Eisen , in that case I should think you 'd be willing to comply with the rules of the school that gives you free tuition . You know , ordinarily you would have been automatically expelled for this . But I thought I 'd talk it over , see if we could straighten you out . I see you 're going to study law . Shucks , you understand the very first idea of law , which makes us obey a lot of rules that might be a bit irksome , privately , but which are designed for the good of the community . You know , sometimes we just work up a resistance to doing what we are told we have to do . " Sam caught the special gleam in the dean 's eye , as if the man knew he had touched on the right spot . Maybe all this was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I say the whole thing is a gentleman 's agreement , which you undertook --  " Watch out ! Sam felt a warning in his very guts . This beaming , broad , red , goyish face , was an enemy face . Here it came : " I 'll tell you , Eisen . There 's one kind of fellow that I would n't hesitate to invite to my home for dinner , I would n't hesitate to introduce him to my daughters "  --  the dean chuckledopenly , as man to understanding man  --  " I 'm sure that 's the kind of fellow you are , at bottom . Rut --  " Sam was blazing . Anyway , he now felt completely free . " Think it over for a day or two , " the dean said . " I ' 11 try and hold up the ax . I do n't like to sec a fellow get started wrong . A thing like this might influence your entire life . And if you want to talk it over some more , come in and see me. "  |p2I8  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a sarcastic remark . He took the hand , and received a firm , fellowysqueeze . In the dean 's mind it was a certain thing that he was " straightened out . " " I do n't think I 'll change my mind , " Sam blurted , as he went out . " Well , we 'll see , " the dean said , with a friendly grin , for all life was a game . As he walked down the steps of the building , Sam felt exactly that same wild inner exhilaration he had felt that night coming out of the Freedman basement , from the meetingwhere he had busted out of the Big Ten . It was a hollow , jerky feeling in his very guts . The same excitement a man might feel on walking out of a job ; maybe he has lost something , yet there is an unquenchable singing in the heart , a feeling of lightness , of victory . He belongs to himself again . Walking down Wright Street , he began to figure out what he would do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was nothing for him here . Just go home like that ? Kicked out . And in a flash it was clear to him : he must he the leader . That was the cause of this excited feeling within him , this almost drunken feeling of something big about to happen to him . All his old passion for leadership , the passion that had driven him on to be the big ratan in high school , was awake . So far , there had been nothing for hint to do , at Illinois . School activities had seemed like kid stuff , he had done all that in high school . The jellybeans and frat boys and sorority girls took care of that stuff , here . But this was something real , something important , for him to do . He 'd wake these college boys up to something serious ! He 'd call a meeting , he 'd give them some talk ! I he 'd knock out the R.O.T.C. !  |p219There  were plenty of returned soldiers on campus , they 'd back him up all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Shappy , chile he gnawed at an end of a wurst Sam had got from home . " Do you think you can buck the whole caboodle ? Why , do you know what you 'll run up against ? The United States Government . " " Yah , " Joe Freedman kidded . " They 'll probably send you to Atlanta . " " Oy veh ! " Shappy rocked his head , imitating Yiddish woe . " But even if we do n't get anywhere , " Sam cried , " at least we can wake up some of these dumbbells . " " Listen , Sam , why be a Bolshevik ? " Shappy said , philosophically . " There 's a lot of things , as you go through life , that you have to submit to . You ca n't have everything just the way you want it . So you go to drill a couple of times a week , so what ? Is it going to kill you ? When you 're through you can tell them to kiss your ass . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The thing is , there are plenty of fellows that feel the way I do ! They 're just afraid to open their mouths , that 's all . If we give them a start , they 'll come out . " " Baloney , " Shappy said , holding up the wurst . Joe Freedman drew the pipe out of his mouth , and stuck out his lower lip . " The way I see it , Sam , " he said , " your idea is that they have no right to tell us what to do . At the same time you want to go out and tell people what not to do --  " " No , no  --  " Sam interposed . Joe continued : " As far as I am concerned , the ideal is letting people decide for themselves , without pushing them one way or the other  --  " " That 's just the point ! " Sane yelled . Ile walked up and down , swinging his arms at them like . a trial lawyer . " Make R.O.T.C. optional . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get canned if you do n't decide the way they want you to ? " " That 's quibbling , " Shappy said . " There are other schools . " " Oh , is that so ? Well , this is the state school , and I 've got as much right here as any other citizen ! " Sam declared . That was what he had forgot to tell the dean , damn it . " Aw , why get so wrought up about it , Sam ? " said Joe , scratching the bowl of his pipe . " R.O.T.C. is just a farce , take it as a joke . If it came to a war , and you wanted to be a pacifist , that would be the time to get excited about it . " " Anyway , if it came to a war you 'd have to fight anyway , " Shappy singsonged . " And at least , with R.O.T.C. , you 'd be an officer , and have it easy . " " Aw , for cry sake . " Sam was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you think the students would stick with you , " Shappy said . " These farmer boys like the horsies , and the bayonet practice makes them remember good old pig-sticking time at home . Say , you raise your voice against the R.O.T.C. and those ags will run you off the campus , on a rail . " " Ali right , let them , let them ! " Sang cried , testily . " I do n't like the idea of military , " Joe said . " Rut at least they taught me how to ride a horse . That 's the trouble with you , Sam . You ought to have signed up for the cavalry . " " Aw , what 's the use of talking to you guys ? " Sam said . " Yeah , we 're just a bunch of rubber stamps ! " Shappy winked . Walking across Wright Street , hitter-minded , absorbed , Sam heard a terrific honk right on top of hint , and barely jumped aside in time to escape a Leaping Lena . A caterwaul of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with arms and legs of fellows and girls.  | " Missed him ! " reported a jellybean perched on the rim of the rear seat , riding backwards . Danger , 5,000,000 Jolts , Sam read , scrawled on the body . And , Excuse my Back . And , Do It Again . The flivver zig zagged along the street , aiming at pedestrians . " There 's one ! " a girl screamed . And the others took up the cry : " Frosh ! Frosh ! " The car skeetered after a dazed freshman . . . Oh , what was the use ? It was Ev Goldberg 's turn to entertain the Sunshine Club .  --  Did you hear , Sam Eisen got canned from Illinois ?  --  No ! What for ?  --  Oh , some sort of trouble.  --  Girls ! do n't tell me that woman-hater has been cuttingup !  --  Naa . It was , he refused to take military training , was n't that it , Aline ?  --  That 's what Joe said. - Well , of all things.  --  What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like that for ?  --  Oh , you know Sam . He 's so stubborn.  --  What 's he going to do now ?  --  How should I know ? Have n't you seen him , Lil ?  --  Me ? What have I got to do with Sam Eisen ?  --  Oh , nothing . I just thought -- - Kindly keep your thoughts to yourself.  --  Well , what 's got into you !  --  You do n't have to make any insinuations !  --  Aw , be yourself ! " Well , anyway , girls ! " said Rose I teller , " I think Sam is to be admired for his idealism . At least he sticks up for what he believes . "  | Dear Sam : I bet you ca n't guess who this is from but by now you have probably peeked at the signature so the surpriseis over . I just had to write to you , Sam , as I never get a chance to sec you any more and tell you I think it was very wonderful of you to stand up for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was wonderful of you to quit the U because they make you take military training . I know you must think I am just a Dumb Dora because of the way I act up all the time but even dumbbells can appreciate a thing like that . I heard about it from the girls , as they were discussingit at a meeting of the Sunshine Club , and I was very proud that I knew the fellow who had done that . Well I used to know him anyway . That is the way with all great men when they get famous , you say I used to know them . Well , so long , Sam . I hope you will not always be a woman-hater . Your friend , Lil . " He 'll never get anywhere pulling that kind of stuff , " was Lou Margolis 's opinion . Before his mother , Sam Eisen felt a little ashamed . He would eat , and rush away from the table . Why did she have to pity hint= I lc had felt ' victorinus , until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As though she was afraid to interfere , but only hoped he would n't make another disastrousmove . So now she could n't yammer to all the other wives in the butcher shop that she had a son in the university . His father annoyed him too . To his father this was only another example of the evil of the world , proving why he , an honest man , could never get beyond a buttonhole maker 's machine . If the old lady bought a pot , and the enamel began to come off , Mr. Eisen glittered with happiness . " See ! Swindlers in America ! Even in the big downtown stores ! " If the boss ofp223the shop told the operators to make single instead of double seams , he was happy , triumphant . " Aha ! I told you ! Honest manufacturing ! " When a strike was called and some of his own friends were caught scabbing : " There you have it ! What can you expect in such a world ! People are crooks , swindlers , thieves , robbers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gold tooth flashing derisively , his eyes glitteringbehind his aristocratic half-moon glasses , Mr. Eisen declaimed : " Aha ! America , a nation ! So a boy wo n't carry a gun , so outside ! Outside ! You think it is different here than by the Tsar ? We are supposed to be dumb . We are supposed we do n't know anything . We ca n't tell them anything , our smart children , but they will find out , they will find out .... " And he looked at Sam as though he were just a young simpleton who had needed this experience to learn what anyonewith a grain of sense already knew . Joe Freedman claimed that his case had nothing to do with Sam 's . It was just a coincidence , he said , that out of all the things he could get into a ruckus about , he too should get mixed up with the military . Joe wrote his celebrated theme on military ticktacks because when the funny idea occurred to him , it was irresistible . So he wrote , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " : " There should be more routine and discipline in the daily life of a soldier . In the future recruits will sleep with radio earphones on their heads . At the sound of reveille the soldier will hear the voice of the sergeant booming : " Left eyelid  --  Imp ! ' At this command , he will open his left eye . The next command will be : " Right eyelid  --  hup ! ' Hot h eves are now open . " Company  --  yawn ! ' commands t he sergeant , and all mouths open as one . The mouths remain open until the cotn- mand : Cease yawning ! ' But it is recommended that a special regulation be provided in case of a fly getting into the mouth of a yawning recruit . He may close his mouth upon the fly . But in order to discourage malingering , he shall be required to produce the fly after so doing . " Joe snickered as he wrote . He could already hear the class roaring at this cleverness . " The soldier now hears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three , hup ! ' " and on and on , through the donning of underpants and pants , to the rolling of the puttees with provisions for swearing : " Compannecee  --  cuss ; God damn ! Sum bitch ! Cease cussing  --  hup ! ' " Then came washing , shaving , and the big finale which had Joe actually laughing out loud as he wrote : " To the latrines , march ! Company , halt ! Hands on flies , hup ! Unbutton , hup ! One , two , three , four ! Snodgrass , this is the third day you have missed the fourth button , report to k.p . All right , men , snap into it . I mean out of it . Now , altogether , boys : Position ! Ready ! Aim ! Fire ! I mean water ! ' " With that , Joe had to stop . It was too much . He would bust laughing . One look at Lieutenant Goddard , and the fellows knew fireworks were coming . Goddard stood rigid beside the desk , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually to be a smell of burning . the scar an his chin was glowing and fading with his pulse . " Private Freedman ! " he snapped . Joe stood up . " This your paper ? " He held it up . Joe took a step forward as if to identify the paper . " Why , I guess so , if my name 's on it . " 1 lc grinned . " Wipe that off ! Smart aleck ! If you think you can get away with this kind of  --  of --  "  | " Why , I just meant it as a joke , " Joe began . " A joke ! So you think the whole R.O.T.C. is just a joke , huh ? Why , you , you lousy little  --  " Lieutenant Goddard checked himself , but with so terrific an effort that his veins bulged . " Get out ! " he shrieked . " Get out before I  --  ! " Joe collected his books and , with an effort at seeming unhurried , unafraid , made his way out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brass button would have no sense of humor . And so Joe Freedman , in his turn , was called to confer with the kind-hearted dean . Joe liked to think that he looked at each new face with a sculptor 's glance that cut into every crevice for detail , and at the same time organized the whole image into a unified design . " A square John Bull face , " he said to himself , " the face of a gentleman farmer . " He shambledtoward the desk , smirking . " I 'm Joe Freedman . " The dean tilted back , and gave him a slanting look . Takingup the folded theme , the dean moved it against the flat of his hand . " Freedman , I have to admit that in its way this is a clever little composition . " The dean pulled one corner of his mouth into a pshaw smile . " I suppose you had a lot of fun writingit . " Joe 's grin grew healthier . " Well , we can write anything we please . But what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look , Freedman , I want you to try to think of this in another light . Lieutenant Goddard is a gentleman of the military profession . He has prepared himself for this profession just as you are preparing for ... " " Architecture . " " Exactly . Now , there is room for a great deal of difference of opinion in this world , but there are some things on which gentlemen agree . They do n't insult one another 's profession . " Joe 's grin slid off his face . Ridiculously , he remembered the first time he had lunched with the group in the Midway studio , and had started to eat before everyone was served , then had seen his error . So he was not a gentleman . Just a kike whose old man ran a flophouse . And the minute he came among gentlefolk , he showed his coarseness. " . . . naturally , in my job I come into contact with a great many instances of the  --  well , the thoughtlessness of youth . I suppose a thing like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing , when controlled . So  --  well , Freedman , I guess I could persuade Lieutenant Goddard to accept your apology . " Yet , an impulse of defiance arose in Joe . So what if he was a boor ? Why not be himself ? The hell with all this pretenseand bowing and scraping , and you . first my dear Gaston . " Suppose I do n't feel I can apologize ? " he heard himself saying in a brave squeak . The dean did n't turn away , but it was as if he had . His voice tiptoed over offal . " I 'll put it quite frankly , Mr. Freedman . If you apologize to Lieutenant Goddard I 'll know you 're the sort of person I could invite to dinner at my home . If you do n't apologize , you 're the other sort of per-son . " Joe tried to pull the grin back onto his face . Ha ha , I 'll apologize and see if I get the invite ; I hear he has two beauteousdaughters . He tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole issue on a personal plane . He wondered if the dean had pulled the saute thing on Sam Eisen . No . That was a simple case for expulsion  --  Sam had no imagination . " Take a few days to think it over , if you like , " said the dean , with a warm smile . " Meanwhile I 'm afraid you 'll have to consider yourself under suspension . "  |p227Every  time Joe decided to apologize he would remember that Sam Eisen let himself be expelled rather than knuckle down to those tin soldiers . Over and over he told himself that his case and Sam 's were entirely different : his case involved the principle of free speech . If he stood up for his principles , and got canned , everybody at home would think he was just a Bolshevik like Sam . If he went home the only idea the folks would have of it would be that he got canned . You could n't explain a thing like this to them . They were proud of you and you had to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their smart son . Sylvia would think he was a failure . He 'd show them ! He 'd send that theme to H. L. Mencken , with cartoons of Lieutenant Goddard and the dean ! He 'd go out in a blaze of glory , making Lieutenant Goddard the laughing stock of the school . " I am still waiting , " he would conclude his article , " for the dean 's invitation to dinner ! " At the board next to Joe worked a laughing kid from Danvilleknown as Blondy . One of those clean-cut , typically American-looking boys , with a right-angled jaw and cool blue eyes . The kind of guy who pulled practical jokes with thumbtacks but always had a buck to lend , cigarettes to pass around , an extra sheet of tracing paper . He acted light-headed all the time , bubbling over his board with dirty songs , limericks . But Blondy could be serious , too . If any of the fellows got in a jam , he would grow calm and cool , like simmering water , when the heat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between Joe and Blondy . What Blondy had , t hat Joe knew he could never have , was this complete acceptance of , and by , his en- vironment . With him , Danville seemed exactly the right place to have come from , his house probably the tightest place in Danville . And now it occurred to Joe that Blondy was exactly the sort of person whom the dean would naturallyask home for dinner ; Joe could picture Blondy taking out the dean 's daughter , and loving her up , in a car . And the dean expecting him to do so . " Hey ! Where y ' going with the T-square ? " Blondy kidded as Joe packed his stuff . " Blondy , I must bid you farewell . " And Joe told him the trouble . " So they want you to crayfish , huh ? " Blondy said , his face still , and serious . Even the expression sounded foreignly American . Smalltownish , goyish . Joe guessed its meaning . " Yah . " " Gon na do it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask : " Would you ? " but the look of intent interest on Blondy 's face prevented him . He knew that Blondy would not have apologized ; but at the same time , refracted through Blondv , his whole scheme for " revenge " by writing up the incident seemed cheap . As he walked around campus , feeling that perhaps he was taking his farewell , Joe worried and struggled to make a decision ; the incident seemed to augment in significance all the time . If he were home , talking it over Nvith Rudy Stone , Rudy would tell him to apologize , and mean it . Mitch  --  well , Mitch would never have got into this kind of a scrape . Alvin would send the article to Mencken ! " Hey ! What 's the order of the day ? " Shappv kidded , passingJoe on the campus . " One , two , three  --  button up ! " laughed I larry Josephs ; the contents of Joe 's theme had got around . " What 'd they do , can you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a court martial . " " Not yet ; suspended . I 'm supposed to apologize . " " Go on , apologize ! What 'll it cost you ? " Shappy grinned , and the gang passed on . In the late afternoon light the white mansion pillars of the Women 's Building glowed like a row of smiling teeth ; the brick of the building had a hearth-red warmth . This was the building partly designed by Stanford White , before his death . A man brought up in a house like this would n't have to be told how a gentleman behaves . And Joe thought , hang it , there was something down here that he had n't met before in his life . It was as though this were inner America . Sure , Chicago was America , but Americamade up of dagos , Irish , Poles , Jews , the bloody nineteenthward , and back o ' the yards , and Maxwell Street and Little Italy . You came down to a place like this , with space between the buildings , and things set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was like a homely living room assembledof odd pieces , but by people who could n't be wrong . Here were these houses with their white-pillared porches , and they were right , and he was wrong . Joe walked away from the campus , into Champaign . This was just an Illinois town , with houses set back from the streets , each on its lawn . And he- suddenly had a complete idea of how he wanted his life to he , to live in some such house as one of these , with gables and cupolas , and a crazy little glass observatory on the roof ; to have a garage fixed over into a studio with a big skvlight ; to walk back into the garage and work at sculpture all dav , to walk up to the house and wash , and Sylvia would he waiting , dinner ready , maybe a kid with a snotty nose . When you thought of the row on row of two-story graystonefronts on Central Park Avenue , Clifton Park Avenue , Lawndale Avenue , Sawyer Avenue , Millard Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to wall on Douglas Boulevard and on Independence Boulevard , you realized that this sometimes ugly heterogeny of the rural town , this styled stylelessness , these old houses built by some skilled carpenter with the missus telling him to stick out a baywindow there , stick on a bit of porch there , this was the thing , this was Blondy , this was America out of which true gentlemen came , gentlemen who knew enough not to insult their fellow-man 's profession , gentlemen who asked each other to dinner . He was about to push open the door of a tobacco shop , when he noticed the wooden Indian that stood by the stoop . Ordinarily you took these things as part of the landscape , like fireplugs . Maybe it was the way the sunlight illuminated one side of the wooden face , as though the Indian stood by a campfire . Life-size , and mounted on a two-foot pedestal , with paint so weatherworn that it seemed an integral part of the wood , with a large split up one of the legs , and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see some small-town carver choppingthis image out of a log , spending days of patient and happy toil with a Whittling knife probably , incising the long rows of markings on the feathers . Why , - this was American art . Why must he always go at things roundabout ? Architecture was okay , hut in his heart he knew it was just an idea of having a profession while he tried to become a sculptor . This w as where he should start from . It would be better to be some small-town wood-carver , gravestone-carver than a fancy garret artist . To be part of a place , have a house to live in ... lie touched the cracked wood . Yah , them days are gone forever . Joeboy Dear : . . . but I must try not to be selfish , because if you do get expelled you 'll coins back to Chicagop231and we will be near each other . . . . But , Joey , ca n't you treat the whole thing as if it were beneath you ? I mean , I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but why should we argue with people who are so narrowminded ? Would it be right for you to let your quarrel with them make you leave school ? After all , architecture is the main thing , so why let those dizzy officers interfere ? .. . Joe , I have been looking at nothing but cigar-store Indians since your thrilling description ... . Oh , and here is some gossip . Sam Eisen , the woman-hater , is falling for Lil Klein since he came back ! Sweetheart , I wish you were here . I hold your hand . And now , a kiss . Your girl , Sylvia . P.S. Could n't you just write a formal note of apology for those nitwits , and everybody would know you did n't mean it , and the laugh would be on them ? Joe smiled , and put the letter in his pocket . Young Rabbi Waller was a recent graduate of the CincinnatiSchool , where rabbis could be as liberal , as reformed , as they pleased . And he had come to the B'nai Brith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the younger generation of Jews while they were still in the colleges . So the B'nai Brith had given him some money to try to establish a Jewish Foundation at a few universities . This Foundation was to be a sort of club , where Jewish boys could gather , play chess , and , the books being left around , maybe they would do a little reading in Jewish fields . The dean , chatting with Rabbi Waller , said : " Lieutenant Goddard really feels quite badly about the whole thing , and I think Freedman ought to be brought around . I do n't like to have to expel him over this , but the way he 's acting , he 's going to force me to do it . " " I have an idea , " said Rabbi Waller . " But I do n't want him to think I 'm trying to influence him . "  | One night when Joe stopped in at Shappy 's place , Waller was there . " Pheh ! " Shappy cried . " What are you burning in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is you pups are so used to smoking molasses and wrapping paper , you do n't know real tobacco when you smell it , " Joe advised him . " That 's Ploughboy , is n't it ? " Waller remarked . Joe nodded . He had n't taken to Waller , because , first , he did n't see why the Jews had to go off in their own corner and have a Jewish Foundation , and secondly , he believed if a man was going to be a rabbi , then let him be a rabbi with a beard and heavy eyebrows . He was against the new breed of rabbis who looked like dentists , with their toothbrush mustachesand slick hair . Waller had pulled out his tobacco pouch . He offered it . Joe sniffed . " Purty good , " he assented . " I mix my own , " Waller said . ' Want to try it ? " " Say , that 's a noble pipe , " Joe remarked , as the rabbi filled the bowl . " Dunhill , " Waller confessed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I low much arc they over there ? " " Well , I paid a pound for this one . It 's worth twice as much here . " Some day , Joe thought , he would go over , and bring back a Dunhill . " Say , what happened with those paskudnyaks , are they going to shoot you at sunrise ? " Shappy asked . " That 's one thing , a Jew can never get along in the army , " Waller laughed . " They tell a story about how a couple of Yidlach missed a chance to win the war for Russia . It seems that there was a squad of real religious Jews on the RussianGermanfront , you know , Litvaks who carried ttillin in their knapsacks . When prayer time came they needed one more top233make up a minyan . Come on , ' says Chayim Traask , I know a place we 'll maybe find a Jew . ' So they crawl over to the enemy lines . There 's a latrine , and there they wait . Well , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he suddenly had to go . Sure enough , the two Yids see the Kaiser come in . They give him time to pull his pants down , but then they take one look , sigh , and beat it . Their pals jumped on them . Where 's our minyan ? Did n't you find anyone ? ' Yah , we caught one , ' they admit , but the devil take him , it turned out to be the Kaiser , and he was n't even a Jew , so we left him sitting there . ' " Joe was beginning to like the rabbi . Waller told another story , about a Russian Jew who was an orderly to a general , who beat and kicked him around . Every week , the little Jew 's wife sent him a package of kosher food ; one Saturday the general sees him eating it , grabs a piece of kishke , and gobbles it down . Fine ! Wonderful cooking ! After that , the poor little Jew is a goner . The general is nuts about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . Then the Jew decides to fix the general . He writes a letter to his wife . Next week , when the food comes as usual , the general gobbles it up , smacks his lips , rubs his belly . But the Jew runs outside and lies down on the ground and laughs till he nearly splits a gut . What are you laughing at , Yankel ? That poyr , he says , that general , he likes kosher kisbkes , he ate up the whole package , and do you know what they were ? This time theywere trei f ! From a pig ! " Shappy screamed with laughter . Waller went on . His store of Yiddish yarns was inexhaustible , and in each t here was that characteristic Jewish twist , that humbled arrogance , that irony of the servant who secret Iv knows himself to be superior to his master . Gradually , as he talked , he threw in more serious touches , and he worked back to earlier wars , to stories of Jews who starved and maimed themselves to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stories ofp234Jews in times of the Inquisition , to stories of Kiddush ha Sheen , when whole cities of Jews were burned by Crusaders , and back further , to stories of the false Messiahs , and of a Jew named Reubeni who sought to gather an army and recapturePalestine .. . . And as Waller , a young fellow from New York , a smoothfacedrabbi who smoked a Dunhill , went on talking , Joe remembered some of the stories told by Sylvia 's uncle Bialystoker , and got a kick out of contributing them to the session . It was pretty late when they went out for coffee . By that time the question of the apology had been settled , somewhere far back in Joe 's mind . The little lieutenant , with his posturing , his honor , was far beneath his contempt . You wrote something with a Yiddish twist . Something that apologized , and yet did not apologize . For instance : " Dear Lieutenant Goddard : I am sorry I turned in that paper making fun of the army . Had I known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it in . " See ? And you thumbed your nose at his behind . When Joe was back at work over his board , Blondy Walsh said , quietly : " So you crayfished , eh ? " " Huh ?  --  " You apologized to the loot . " " Oh , yah . It was n't worth it . Wait 'll I tell you what I wrote . . . " Joe began . But Blondy , humming " The Bastard King of England " over his board , seemed hardly interested . Sam Eisen heard from Shappy about Joe 's case . Sam shrugged , wryly . Kids , was his opinion . Thee do n't know what it 's all about . A Modern MarriageUp to one moment Estelle was goofy about him . Whenp2235he came back from New York in the tin lizzie he had bought with his earnings from the summer outdoor sprints , and on the very first night honked his horn in front of her house , Did you miss me kid , Oh boy I 'll say I did , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did to her , his big goodnaturedface and his curly hair and his warm strong body . She felt like she would fly to him anywhere and do whatever he wanted . It was swell all through the fall . Going out to the dunes with some of the bunch , driving the lizzie , and the two of them getting lost accidentally on purpose on some deep waste hollow of sand , and doing it there . Oh , do it again ! In the long evenings with the kids squatting around a fire , and Sol with his uke singing , " Do It Again , " and none of the kids knew what the song meant to them , to each other . Do it again ! She got to feeling she was going wild with passion , letting herself go like this . The first fumbling time when he had been sick and she had crept into the brass bed they had been so bashful , the both of them so mixed up . But through the Indiansummer Estelle began to feel , oh , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Sol ! She would seize his hair in her hands and pull , harder , harder . Oh , ride me , big boy , ride nee , ride me down ! In her house when her folks were out , with their ears awake for the sound of feet on the stairs ; in the car , on a side road that ran off Ogden Avenue , she was hot , she was unashamed ; she knew everybody was talking about her but she did n't care . Just his coming near her made her want it . It was terrible . None of the girls knew Nv hat it was like . They ! Just kids . Then Estelle got a scare . She was a week overdue . She did n't want to say anything to Sol as yet , but after the first week he began acting kind of funny , as though he guessed something was wrong . Did he keep tab on her time ? That was something mysterious and unclean they never mentioned to each other , but she guessed he knew what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ due , and they were necking , she would feel his big hand moving lower on her back , exploring , to discover whether she was wearing something extra under her clothes . After two weeks , she could stand it no longer . She was jumpy and full of mean cracks , and that night when he took her to the College Inn after seeing Merton of the Movies , he said something about all the dough he was spending lately , and she remarked : " What 's the matter , are n't you getting your money 's worth ? " So he got sore . She waited all day for him to call . Oh , God , it was terrible . Maybe he was calling and the phone was out of order , if only a call came so she would know the phone was all right . Oh , God , it was terrible , in spite of being modern and unconventional , all a girl could do was sit and wait for the man to call . A girl should never call a fellow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she could n't lower herself so much as to call him and give him the idea she was chasing . But in the morning she could n't stand it , and went to the drug store and phoned . Of course his mother had to answer . " Who ? Solly ? Who is it please ? . . . Oh , how are you , Estelle ? So many girls are always calling up S ( 'ify , you know they go crazy for him when they see hint riding the bicycle . So he tells me , do n't even answer them . Wait , I 'll tell him you are calling . " Her voice hung for a moment . Estelle could almostfeel it add : " What do you want hint for ? " When Solly came over , his face was white and his lower lip hung . Estelle had never seen hint loot : like that . Something went out of her.  | " Aw , gee , kid , " he mumbled , his eyes fishing away , " are you sure ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " She could n't help sensing the peevishness in his voice , **27;4936;TOOLONG . " I ca n't tell for sure , " she explained . " But I 've always been so regular . " " Listen . Cantcha do something ? " He did n't say , I 'll stick by you , kid . He did n't say , If anythinggoes wrong , we 'll get hitched . So she could have answered , Aw , do n't worry , Solly . " Ca n't you ask sonic of the girls what to do ? " he blundered . " Ca n't you ask in a drug store ? " He got so shifty-eyed , so yellow-faced , that in her disgust she did n't want to spare him anything . " You 'll have to take care of it . It was n't my fault . " " Huh ! How do I know it was me ? I always used a safe ! " She went hot and cold . Her fingers curled to claws . So that was all she was to him ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , I hope you choke ! " she sputtered , inadequately . " I hope you choke ! " " Say , Plotsy , say , I know a fellow that  --  his girl got caught . " Sol knew his face was a give-away . Anybody could tell it was about himself . But Runt was a good guy . Runt knew his way around . Plotkin told him the name of some pills that cost fifty cents . Sol avoided the drug store where Rudy worked , or any store in the neighborhood . He drove over to Madison and Kedzie . There were Christmas displays in the store windows . Merry Christmas . Yah , Marry Christmas , as the fellows said . The drug-store guy got the stuff without a word , but soaked him a buck . Estelle opened the box and read the ad inside the cover . Safe and reliable . The kind your mother used.  |p238If  that was n't a scream , The kind your mother used ! She laughed so hard you would think that would have done the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the girls ! The day after Christmas was a terribly cold day , with a blizzard swirling in the streets . Estelle lay around all day . The pain ground and ground . A half-dozen times her mother had asked her : " What 's the matter , Estelle , do n't you feel good ? " The old lady could tell . But maybe she thought she was just being late . Well , that bum was lucky . Maybe she ought to call up the punk and relieve his anxiety . But she had no feelings about him , any more . What had it been , love , that had come and gone ? Oh , she was getting to know so much , more than any of the girls . Sol came over . The blizzard had stopped but it was bitter cold , and the wind shot along the streets . When he came in , his nose was red and his eves were watery with cold . He looked so funny that for a moment she got a quiver of the old feeling for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway saving : " Well , how are you , Sony , you are a stranger here lately , " and finally backed out of the room , looking ; at them darkly , suspiciously . Now they were alone , Estelle said : " Well I got a Christmas present for you . It was a false alarm . " " Gee , that 's swell ! " He was all changed . I le was ready to act as though nothing had happened het vv ccn them . He started to tell her how his car had frozen . But she did n't respond , and after a minute there seemed nothing to talk about . " How  --  how about New Year 's , kid ? " he said as he was leaving , sort of dutifully . " We 'll see . Call me tomorrow , " she said , but she was al/ready checking over who might call her up , for a New Year 's date . By , Sol . She did n't feel sad , she did n't feel blue . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how to handle men . Live and learn . " Gee that 's cute ! " Estelle cried as Lil appeared at the edge of the Garfield Park rink , wearing a yellow and blue knitwearset of muffler , beret , and mittens . " Is it new ? " " Mandel 's , " Lil reported . " You 'll never guess how much ! " " I 'll bite . " " Five-fifty . " " Is that all ! " The girls squatted to strap on their skates . " Look , we got an audience , " Lil whispered . A couple of fellows were bending over pretending to fix their skates , trying to get a look up . Estelle snorted . Maybe last year she would have got a kick out of it , like Lil , but now she knew what it was all about . They climbed to their feet and skated right by the fellows , one of whom remarked : " Redheads are hot stuff . " Skating along , Estelle was beginning to feel herself coming to life , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you think a girl ought to give herself to the man she loves ? " Estelle nearly let out a hoot of laughter ; but Lil looked so cute with her wind-reddened cheeks that she wanted to give her a big-sister hug . " Of course everybody says a girl makes herself cheap if she gives herself to a man unless there married , " L.il went on . " They say after that he do n't want her any iure . But I do n't know . Why should n't thev love each other even more ? " " I guess it depends on the fella and the girl , " Estelle said.  | " That 's just what I say ! I think if they really love each other , they ought to go the whole way . I mean , what do you get being a virgin , anyway ? I think it 's dumb to be a virgin . If you really loved a fella , would you do it ? " Lil said . " I guess you do anything when you 're in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't get married , and they may have to wait years and years , what 's the sense of waiting ? " Lil pleaded . " I do n't mean just a cheap affair . I mean real love . " " Kiddo ! Have you got it bad ! " Estelle exclaimed . The two fellows were clowning now , almost skating into the girls , then veering off with a haw haw and pretending to nearly fall . " I hope they flop ! " Lil said so they could hear . Then she could n't help giggling as the taller of the two staggered on his skates , took a comical flop , and then pretended to count stars . But immediately she grew aloof . " The thing is , it must be so different , " she said to Estelle . " That 's what scares me . It 's  --  it 's  --  something you ca n't take back . It must be like being born or something . If only I knew what It was like . " " There 's only one way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you be scared ? I mean  --  her tone became chummier than ever  --  " if you were in love with someone . Like Sol , for instance . Would you do it ? " " I 'm not so crazy about Sol , " Estelle said . " Honest ? I thought you were going steady . " Estelle snorted . It might as well get around that she and Sol had bust up . " I do n't think I 'll sec hint any more , alto-gether . " " Oh , I got kind of tired of him . " Her tone was final , closing the subject . The girls skated . " They say fellas do n't like it the first time with a girl , " Lil resumed . Her voice was high , brittle , flappery again . " Ip241do n't think it 's really worth while , being a virgin , do you , Estelle ? " Estelle replied in the same sophisticated tone : " Yah , think of what you miss ! " Arms around waists , they swooped over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their legs . The two fellas chased them . " My mother and father have gone out , " Lil informed Sam . " Boy , are they swell tonight ! They went to the Del Roi . " Sam had n't yet decided where to go . Of course it was too late now to get tickets for the swell places , like Terrace Gardens or the College Inn . " Shall we call up some of the kids and see what they 're doing ? " she said . " Syl Abramson is having a New Year 's party . " He sat down on the couch . Naturally she sat on his lap and put her mouth ready for a hello kiss . There was no hurry about going any place . They were necking fiercely , yet , in every movement that she made , there was a strangeness , abruptness , jerkiness , and sometimes her eyes stared wide at him with an expanding wonder . " What 's the matter , honey , is something wrong ? " he said , at her long silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She flung her arm around his neck , and gave him a long French kiss . Sam remembered the time over a year ago when he had first had a crush on Lil , and had seen her necking in the car with Mort Abramson ; but this was as if she were truing to erase everything she had ever done , and give herself to hint . As he picked her up , and carried her with fiercely tense muscles , her heart was filled with expanding sworls of fright  --  oh , what if the whole thing should go wrong ?  --  but with a blind clenching little pride at her own recklessness ; and beyondeverything , her heart was filled with oh I love him I do love him oh I love him it 's not wrong if you love . When the bells began to ring and the whistles to blow , Lil could n't help giggling . " That 's for us , Sammy . Our New Year . Oh , are n't you glad we did it this way ? " She slid the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the sight of her naked legs so nice and firmly formed , so young and sweet against the bed . Sam got up and walked to the window . He looked so odd standing there naked , his hand against the brocade drape . Her eyes traveled slowly down his wide back . He was squareset , solid , and strong . It had hurt a little , but she did n't feel any different . " Sam ! " she said , her triumph and happiness bubbling . in her voice . He turned and looked at her , so seriously . " Funny face ! " she said . " I love you , Lil , " he said , awfully serious . She skipped over and stood against him naked , and kissed him . Right there in the window , listening to the pistol shots and the auto horns and the factory whist ICS . After a moment , she experienced a real womanly feeling of protection for his bode against drafts and colds , and sicknessand decay . It swept through her as something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sonlet hing on , you 'll catch cold , dear , " she said , and knew she would make him wear rubbers when it rained . " Was n't this a swell way to have a New Year 's party ? " she giggled , feeling cute and clever again . " Vas it a good party , my lover ? " Tasting the strange word . " Well , one thing about it , it certainly was a surprise , " Aline Freedman said.  | " Those kids arc crazy ! " Rose Heller insisted . " What will they live on ? " " I call it a gyp , " put in Ev Goldberg . " The first one in the bunch to get married , and we do n't even get a wedding . " " If you ask me , " Thelma Rvskind said , " it looks kind of fishy . Lil would n't pass up the chance to have a big wedding , unless there was a reason . " For my part , I do n't think Sammy Eisen was in such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to , " Aline offered . " I would n't put it past Lit . " " She certainly worked fast . Why , when did he come back from Illinois ? " " Oh , that was months ago , " Skinny Heller said . " It must be six months . That 's time enough . " There was a shriek of concerted laughter ; Skinny blushed . Mrs : Heller came from the kitchen and stood grinning with pleasure at the enjoyment of the girls . " Oh , I just noticed , Mrs. Heller , " Celia Moscowitz said . " Is n't this a new rug ? " " Uh-huh , " said Skinny . " Genuine oriental . " The girls all bent to examine the rug , chirping and marveling ; is it real Persian or American Persian ? How much ? But of course the Hellers got their furniture wholesale through their store . No wonder they kept their flat so beau-tiful ! " I like to have a nice home for my children , " Mrs. Heller said , as she retired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing for Lil , she certainly got more out of it than Estelle , " Thelma remarked . " Meow ! " from Rose Heller . " As far as I am concerned , Sam Eisen is no loss . " Ev Goldberg remarked : " Some sheik . " " But why all the secrecy ? Was she afraid we 'd steal him away from her or something ? " " Oh , listen , girls , what 's the idea of all this anyway ! " Syl Abramson started to make a speech . " After all Lil is our friend and so is Sani and anyway I think it 's disgraceful to run them down like this . Maybe it just did n't occur to you that they might happen to have got married because they love each other ! " Her cheeks were burning . " That 's right , " Aline Freedman voted . " We certainly are acting like a bunch of old hens . " " Oh , what does it hurt to dish a little dirt ? " " The trouble is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes us all feel like a bunch of old maids . "  --  Skinny , if you do n't take the cake !  --  Well , Lil was the youngest one of the bunch , was n't she ?  --  That 's right ! Can you beat it !  --  She 's just your age , is n't she , Syl ?  --  Girls , we better get busy !  --  But what 's he going to do ? How are they going to live ?  --  That 's a heck of a way to get married.  --  I would n't get married unless I had an apartment all fixed up and ready to move into.  --  They 'll probably live with her folks for a while.  --  Listen , Sam is n't so dumb , do n't forget old man Klein has plenty.  --  Oh , Thelma , that 's all you think about people .  --  Girls . We ought to send IAI something.  --  I do n't see why . She certainly did n't act as if we were even friends of hers.  --  Have n't you any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Listen , how much have we got in the treasury ?  --  Maybe we could buy her a layette.  --  Thelma ! Will you cut that out ! " Oh , Mrs. Heller ! You should n't have bothered ! " Celia cried , as Mrs. Heller brought in a tray . Mrs. Heller beamed on them . " Well , girls , what do you know about Lil Klein , she fooled you all , ! rah ? She beat youp245to it ! My my my , they are growing up and getting married already ! " She surveyed them all , these lovely girls , so young , so fresh , so sweet , such fine young American girls . We 'll Build a Sweet Little NestHere is how things stood with Sam . Counting commissionshe was pulling down thirty , thirty-five a week on the floor of the C. and J. Haberdashery Shop on State Street . He was good at selling . His intense manner pushed people , and the honesty in his face , due to his idealism , gave men confidence . He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for twenty-three easily . His quick , heavy beard , always showing the shaving swath , gave him maturity . He figured that in no time at all he should become a branch manager in the C. and J. chain . There was no competition . All the guys in the store were either middle-aged deadheads with dandruff dribbling onto their coats , or young pimplyfacedsmart alecks . Sam figured he knew just what he was doing , getting married . He saw how all the rest of the fellows went around sniffing up girls ' legs , went around with always dirty minds , like babies with dirty pants . His own body gave him no rest . When he was near all his guts were molten with lovedesire . He needed her all the time . And what could they do ? Chances like that time New Year 's night were rare . He had no car . He could n't take a girl like Lil to a hotel , and anyway , that cost a lot , and besides , she could n't stay all night . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . The only way was to get married , and then he could have her like he wanted . He resisted his conclusions as long as he could . After all he was so young , he might meet someone else , later . Then what would he do ? Other fellows would n't think of getting married till they were all set . But it gave him a kind of pleasure to feel he could take on the added burden of early marriage , and make good . And sure , he really loved her . When he saw her cute and pert , waiting for him , ready to do whatever he wanted to do , a melting took place inside of him . He was crazy about her from that New t'ear 's night , when she had stripped the sheet from her body and lain bare on the white bed , so brave , and vet so timid , so wise with her smooth sunny head and yet so bashful that she half turned away when his eyes went over her body . He was nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kewpie doll , and in the next moment , before he himself knew he was tired of that line , could change to an intelligent modern girl , discussing serious things , their problems , their life ! When he got near her he just went to pieces with having to have her . So there was a Saturday that was just a little windy , and full of outdoor pep , yet with a warm sun ; Lil met him at noon , she had her father 's Dodge , and all of a sudden he wanted to go out to the country , to the dunes . The dunes were deserted . They climbed , and stood on the highest sandhill and looked at the lake , so wide and clean , and even die Cary steel mills looked fine and clean in the spring air . They passed a bunch of shacks , and , oh , if they could only stay all night , and all tomorrow . But Lil 's mother would have conniption fits . " Tell her we had a whole gang out here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ho , and call them up . " They started to drive back , but going ; through Gary there was an electric sign : Justice of the Peace . Legal Marriages Performed Here . " What does he have to advertise it fors " Lil asked . " Oh , Indiana is where couples from Chicago come , when they elope , " Sam said . So , on the spur of the moment , they did it . And went backp247to the dunes and rented a cottage for the night , and it had a real patchwork quilt . " Some honeymoon , " Sam apologized . " I do n't want a honeymoon , you 're my honeymoon ! " Lil sang , and squeezed him . And she loved to tell the story of how she happened to get married : " We were driving home from the dunes , and there was the sign : Justice of the Peace ; so convenient ! " She loved to tell it like a harum scarum adventurous modern girl who would do anything on the spur of the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew all the time what he was doing . As they got up from the table Sam realized he was a head taller than his father-in-law ; this gave him an odd shock . Why , his father-in-law was just a little Jew . One week when he had had good luck on commissions , and earned more than his own father earned at the shop , Sam had experienced the same queer grown feeling . Mr. Klein was one of those skinny little real estate men with sharp shoulders , a derby , suits with hard edges , and a cigar always in his mouth . Sam had nothing against Mr. Klein , in fact he was anxious to like him , but it was a funny thing that Mr. Klein reminded him of their landlord , and of all the landlords they had ever had : the allrightniks to whom rent had to be paid . Lil was helping her mother clear away the dishes , twittering : sit down , ma , rest , I 'll do it ; for Mrs. Klein was one of those sickly women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was always going to new doctors , tryingchiropractors and electric treatments ; at the table she had asked Sam : " What do you think , this Coney , do you think there is something to it ? " And I . il teasingly told how she had caught her mother reciting : " Every day , in every way , I am growing better and better . "  | " You mean fetter and fetter ! " Mr. Klein had jested , for that was Mrs. Klein 's trouble , she kept putting on weight . " It ai n't flesh , it 's unhealthy , " she insisted . " Well , Sam , smoke ? " said Mr. Klein , offering a cigar . Sam mumbled : " Do n't mind if I do . " " Well , my boy , " Mr. Klein started out , in a bold , salesmanlikevoice , " I guess I do n't know what to say any more than you do ; I only got one daughter , and I never had a son-in-law before . " He cackle-chuckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever had , " Sam said . " So we 're even ! " They both laughed , restrainedly . So far it was fine . " Well , tell me , Sam , " withdrawing his cigar with a sucking noise ; " what is your ambition in life ? " Sam froze . Then he pitied Mr. Klein , all tight and creased like a real estate bond , and trying to talk to his son-in-law . " This is the first chance we have had for a man-to-man talk , " Mr. Klein said . " Sam , I wo n't conceal from you that if you had asked me , I would have said you should both be a little bit older before you  --  ah  --  sign up for a life term . But nowadays we old folks got to take a hack seat . Youth will be youth , and what can we do about it ? " Sam squirmed . " Oh , Sam , I , il did n't mention , what kind of business is your father in ? " " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment he corrected himself : " He is n't in any business , he 's a buttonholemaker . " " Oh , ah . Well , Lil tells me you arc going back to law school . That 's a fine thing , Sam . You look to me like an ambitiousfeller and you know I got quite a bit of law business Di ) self . " He puffed . " I know people , I could help you get a start . How long do you have to go before you finish ? " " Nearly two more years . " " So long ? "  | " I missed out on a couple of semesters . " " Well , what is a year more or less ? " The cigar waved . " Tell me , Sam , what kind of a job have you got ? How much do you make ? Haha , it do n't hurt if I ask you this now , the worst is done already , haha . " Sam told him . " Well that ai n't so bad for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! But listen , Sam , if I can help you out , do n't hesitate to ask me . " Lil was wearing a ribbony negligee and as she came and curled on his lap it still felt shocking to see her combination undies and the gentle dent the garter made around her thigh . She braided his forelock and coaxed : " What 'll it hurt you , honey ? It 's just to make them feel good , it 'll only take a couple of hours and it 'll be all over . You know you owe them something because if it was n't for them there would n't be any me . Or would you be better off without me ? " " Now , Li ! , baby , we agreed we were n't going to have any public wedding and make an exhibition of ourselves . " He had to watch out ; she was going to try to wind him around her little finger . " It 's only for mother 's sake , you know a mother loves to see her daughter 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ break . Honest , Sammy , she 's really a sick woman and I 'd feel so bad if anything happened to her and I knew I had disappointed --  " " Oh , everybody knows we 're married already and why make fools of ourselves ? " " Well , it can be the Jewish wedding . Lots of times there 's a couple of weeks in between . " " What do we want with a churppe and all that junk ? " " It is n't for us , Sam . " She moved subtly on his lap . " Honey , it 's for them . After all we owe them some consideration .... " " Well , I 'm not going to make a public exhibition of my- self . All those kids in the bunch are gabbing about us already and if they think they 're going to come and stare --  " " Oh , but we would n't have any of them ! It 'll be private , just for the two families . We can have it right here in the house . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saving : " But , Lil , you know I do n't believe in weddings , all that stuff is the bunk . . . " when he heard her giggle . " What 's so funny about it ? " " It 's so , " she giggled , " funny "  --  giggle  --  " talking about it  --  wedding  --  when we 're "  --  giggle  --  " in bed like this ! " and with a burst of laughter , she cuddled herself against him . He had to laugh . " Monkey ! " he said . " Bear ! " she cried . " Grrr . " So Lil bought hand-made Italian lingerie in the Stevens shop , and the darlingest wedding dress of white satin , with a sweep , hemline high in front and low in back , suggesting a train , and with a trim of real ermine circling low on her hips . Lil saw in the paper the picture of Gloria Morgan being wed to Reginald Vanderbilt , vv caring her mother 's bridal veil . And vv hat was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ veil out of an old bundle stowed away in the basement . As her mother , with a trembly diffidence , offered her the veil  --  for who knew how an ; American girl would react to old-fashioned customs ?  --  Lil really cried . Why were the old folks so ashamed of themselves ? When her family did things just like the Vanderbilts ! What a chance she had passed up , to have a swell wedding , and show the whole bunch how she had beat them to it ! The house would really be too small , even for their relatives , so why not have the wedding in the ' Temple Judea ? And just ap251small reception afterward , in the basement ballroom . They could get Husk O'Hare 's Orchestra . " ... But , Sammy , what 's the difference ? If we 're going to have a wedding anyway we might as well have some fun out of it ! " " Fun ! If that 's your idea of fun  --  ! " " ... A wedding is the bride 's affair anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have nothing to say about it ! " Her voice had risen to a shrill quavering note . They would he heard . That was the hell of living with her parents ; Sam felt they were being watched , listened to , every moment . Well , that would be over in a few days , thank God , though how in hell he was going to buy a flat full of furniture he could n't figure out . He hated the idea of installment buying . " Listen , Lil , we 've got to get this straight right now . So we 'll understand each other , about things . " He kept his voice calm , while he held her hand . " Now , if you wanted a fancy wedding , you should have asked for it in the first place , instead of trying to coax it out of me by bits . Let 's always be square and open with each other . Now , it was in the back of your mind that you could gradually coax me into it , was n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know all my thoughts ! " Lil capitulated , filled with admiration for her husband , and figuringshe 'd better be more roundabout , after this . In the afternoon , when the girls started coming over , Sam did n't know where to hide . From the bedroom , where Lil was showing her things , he could hear their squeaks and exclamations . And Lil 's constantlyreiterated , " But you know Sam , he just would n't let me have a public wedding , it 's so old-fashioned ... "  |p252Aline  Freedman and Celia Moscowitz , Ev Goldberg and Thelma . He went out for a walk , but Rose Heller met him on the stairs . She took his hand and said : " Oh , I do wish you every happiness , Sam , oh , I do , " and looked straight into his eves . She was n't so had . Mainly , he did n't want to see any of the fellows . He was through with them all , with the whole bunch . He was going off by himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flat was so crowded with people that Sam got kind of excited himself . And I , il looked so sweet in that white dress , with the roll of fur around her girl 's hips circling as she moved , like a hoop floating on lapping water . He felt as though he had never known her naked . Seeing her so pretty , Sam almost wished he had let her show off with a fancy wedding . It was noisy , and everybody was eating tangerines and chocolates . Strangers , who must be relatives on her side , grabbed his arm and stared at him . " So this is hey Good luck , young man ! " And he thought he caught side glances licking over himself and I , il , as if there was something on them that shamed they had been sleeping together before this ceremony . Suddenly Sam found himself in , lr. and Mrs. Klein 's bedroom , with Mr. Klein and his own father . The old man looked strangely stuck together , with his barber-shaven face , and the cleaned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yom Kippur and Passover . I I is yellow-dotted necktiewas pulled into a small tight knot , lost in the arrow of his high collar . Those aristocratic half-moon glasses that he wore on a chain looked borrowed , in an attempt to put on the dog . The three of them stood behind the bed , which was piled high with coats . Mr. Klein hnd secreted a bottle of vishniak ,  |p253the  real stuff . " Well , here is good luck ! " he declared , and they drank the burning cherry brandy , and the two fathers stood and talked to each other like two men whose children are getting married . Sam saw his father holding his head at a cocky , judicious angle ; a mere buttonhole maker might be scared talking to a real-estateiaik , but Mr. Eisen assumed the attitude of an intellectual , a philosopher , who could look around himself on any plane , as an equal , even as a sort of superior mind . " Well , and how is business in your line ? " Mr. Klein finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Right now it is slack season . " " You 're in the clothing business , is n't it ? " " I am a buttonhole maker , " Mr. Eisen asserted , so there should be no false pretense . Just then , in the word and look of his father , Sam realized that to his parents he was marryingabove himself : a rich girl , an heiress ! Lill .. . " I have a brother who is an operator , " Mr. Klein hastened to say , as if to put himself in right with San 's father . " He works for Hart Schaffner . Maybe you know him ? Chayim Klein ? He is here . " Mr. Eisen 's whole attitude softened . He took another little glass of vishniak . " I worked for Hart Schaffner myself , for seven years ... " Rabbi Schor , from the Temple , was a puffily upholstered busybody with plump white hands . Though he was supposed to be a reform rabbi , he wore a yarmalkeb ; it reminded Stmt of a freshman 's skull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the Crowd of uncles , aunts , cousins of the Kleins and of the Fiscus , Sam caught a glimpse of Thelma Rvskind playing the " Wedding March . " Then he saw several of the girls scattered through the crowd ; poor kid , she had n't been able to resist asking them to her wedding.  | A cousin and an uncle , holding his arm , propelled him through the mob toward the wedding canopy that was beingheld up near the front window . " Hat ! His hat ! " Laughter burst among the younger element . " He forgot his hat ! That 's the cat 's nuts ! " and from the older folk , a kind of scandalized murmuring . Sam pushed his way back to the bedroom . Naturally , his hat was buried under the pile of clothes on the bed . Finally he dug it out . The soft crush hat looked like hell with the tux which he had worn only once before : at the Ogden senior prom . But he was keeping Lil waiting at the altar ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid brother , Manny , who looked up at him with a scared , awed face . Rabbi Schor made a little speech about the wise laws of Moses . Lil 's grandmother , a big , toothless woman in a crinkly black silk dress , did n't understand the rabbi 's swift English , and kept saying : " Hah ? bah ? What does he say ? What does he mean ? " Suddenly Lil 's hand clawed his . Sam saw that she had the giggles . Her mouth worked desperately as she tried to keep the laughter from popping out . The rabbi burst into a quick ( mumble of Hebrew , which must be the marriage service itself . Lil 's fingers relaxed ; her palm lay against Sam 's , warm and confiding . Now her face had become grave . She pressed against his side . I lc could feel her whole body vibrating , and as he looked at her he found her eyes speaking out to him , as though she were trying to look all of her love to him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice Nv as rolling and deep now , as a rabbi 's voice should be. .. and I do take this woman for my wife , according to the laws of Moses , and of Israel . "  |p255Bunk  . Moses and the city hall . Sam felt himself prodded . " I do , " he said . He heard Lil pipe : " Yes . I mean , I do . " The rabbi handed him a wine glass . He sipped . Lil touched it with her lips ; but as the rabbi was taking it away , she drew the glass back , and took a gulp of the wine . Then the rabbi put something on the floor . Something wrapped in a napkin . Oh , sure , it was the glass the groom was supposed to break . Sam crushed it under the sole of his new shoe . Mazeltov ! Mazeltov ! Good luck ! the older folks cried , beaming , triumphant . And in the turmoil of red faces , wet mouths , Sam found himself momentarily embracing his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a word caught out of a jumble of sound . He felt her fingers pressing , clutching against his back , while her strained face , on which he seemed to see each separate grain of powder , pressed toward him . In that moment all the strangeness that a fellow felt about his mother : a mother always in the kitchen , or scrubbing the floors with her sloppy skirt tucked around her thick waist , a mother with straggly hair and a voice continually quarreling , complaining , ordering : all the strangeness vanished , and she was just a Jewish mama , tearfuland joyful like the kind Vera Gordon portrayed in the movies , just a Yiddisbe mameb . She was sniveling and at the same time laughing at him , Hib bib , nu , mein zun , nu , Sam , zoll zein mit glick , you should be happy ! she sputtered , and then with a gush of feeling their faces pressed together , and Sam kissed his mother on the mouth , feeling her steamy , flabby lip trembling under his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , too , not knowing just what gesture was right for this moment , put out his hand , to shake hands . " Well , good luck , Sam , good luck ! " It was as if he were going off on some exploit , higher than his old man had ever dared.  | Mr. Eisen 's squinty eyes blinked , and his free arm made a fumbly half-abashed gesture of embracing his son , which he changed to a kind of pat on the back . " Be happy . " Now his kid sister Fanny hung herself around his neck and pulled herself up for a kiss . All of a sudden the whole family felt together , and very dear to each other . Why , this kid sister , Sam felt , he had never known her at all . Fay was growing up husky and chubby , wide-hipped and bigbosomedlike her mother . Her flesh was real pink , and her mouth tasted like fresh butter . Platters of food stood everywhere : the dining room table was loaded , the library table , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corned beef , and laks  --  smoked salmon  --  and sour pickles , and hard salami , and sour tomatoes , and chunks of gefillte fish  --  eat whatever you want ! Take , take ! Laver cakes and cookies and bottles of sweet wine . Mrs. Klein 's idea had been : a little of everything , so everyonecan find what they like ; for how could she serve a regular supper to such a mob in such a small flat ? For half an hour , they stood , a circle around each table , grabbing , cramming meat between slices of bread , Jews eatingcorned beef . Now the two groups of relatives , Sam 's and IA 's , seemed to be stirred together , becoming more and more as one . His father had found her uncle who was an operator at Hart Schatfner 's , and they were gabbing of foremen , piece-rates , stria:es , bosses . Mrs. Eisen was in the kitchen with Mrs. Klein , who was telling her of her bodily ills , and repeating , with a kind of hopeful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get better and better . ' Who knows ? Maybe it helps . " " Do you have to say it in English ? " " 011 my ! maybe . I was always saying it in Yiddish . " Then , out of the jumble of gabbing and gobbling , a voice arose like that of an auctioneer. " 0ne thousand dollars ! " it sang.  |p257There  was a hush , as the crowd pushed toward the frontroom . An uncle stood on a chair , waving a check . " From the bride 's father , for the young couple . " Sam found himself holding the check , while Lil patted his hand . " It 's our wedding present , honeybunch . " He looked at the sum . Sure enough . A thousand bucks . " I  --  I  --  well , thanks , " he said to Mr. Klein , as his father-in-law waved the sum away , with a self-conscious smile . A thousand dollars . For furnishing a flat . And getting a start in life . The uncle on the chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that of Sam 's rich father-in-law . Then he read a series of fake telegrams , with greetings to the bride and groom , and best wishes for early results ; from John D. Rockefeller , and Gloria Swanson . " Lil , you have broken my heart ! " from Rudy ' Valentino . Also a real telegram from Lil 's brother in California , and one signed " The Bunch . " That had been Rudy Stone 's idea . The old lady , Lil 's grandmother , was holding forth in a high voice , in Yiddish : " . . . fleppers they are ? Yenkees they are ? Do n't tell me fairy-tales . It 's the same thing , here and in the old country ! In Kovno the father would find his girl a husband , and send him to the tabmid torah to be a rabbi . And in America he sends him to college to be a lawyer . So what 's the difference ? Ach , do n't  --  bothcr my head with their fleppers and their paint on their faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jewish children , and when it comes to the end it is the same in Tchicagoas in Kovno , they grow up , we marry them , and they have children , may they be healthy ! " The Sunshine Girls sent a beautiful set of electric polychrometorcheres . " I saw the identical thing at Scholle 's , for $12.50 , " Lil declared . " But I bet Rose I Idler 's father got it wholesale for them . "  |p258Harry  Perlin sent a radio , with a double set of headphones . Mort Abramson sent a rolling pin . " I 'm sure this will come in handy ! " he wrote on the card . Lou Margolis sent a rattle . And also a nice bedroom clock . Lil suspected it came from his old man 's pawnshop . Runt Plotkin sent a set of Maupassant , hound in red leather . Lil could n't decide whether to buy a four-room outfit complete , like Revell 's advertised for $425 , or to shop for each ' piece separately . And about the bed . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people were married they had to have a certain amount of independence ; that was the modern point of view . Should the parlor set be mohair or velour tapestry ? " I 'll go crazy trying to decide everything ! " Lil said after the second week of going from Revell 's to Fish 's to Scholle 's . " So will the furniture salesmen ! " Sam kidded , and had to kiss her.  |p261AS  Mort passed the corner of Randolph and Clark , he saw Runt Plotkin standing in front of the cigar store , as usual . Mort parked the car and walked back . Runt was wearing a long , sporty spring overcoat tied by a snappy wide belt . " Wadva know about Sam ! " Runt said . " Well , if a guy ca n't get it any other way , " Mort responded . " He did n't do so bad at that . I bet she 's hot stuff when she gets started . " " I 'll say she is ! " " Yeah ? Talking from experience ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what 's the lowdown ? Is that a fact , was it a shotgun wedding ? " " And if it was ? " Mort said . " She 's a nice piece , and old man Klein has plenty of bucks . " They walked up to where Mort had parked the car , and Runt slipped the bottle out of his overcoat pocket and gave it to Mort . " Do n't mention this , will you , Mort ? " Runt said , as usual . " This driver takes care of me just as a special favor ; they 'd take his hack away from him if they got wise . " Mort took the cap off and sniffed . " That 's good stuff , " Runt said . " I lc gets it from a guy in the Fish Fan 's Club . Ca n't get much . Just takes care of a few friends . " Mort handed over two dollars . " Say , " Mort said , " what are you going to do when Dever starts cleaning up on every-thing ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Rube Moscowitz. , " Mort ad- Looking for a coffee-colored octoroon . They were supposed to be the best . At eleven he was back in his room . Oh , de blacker de berry , de sweeter de juice .. . When he rang , a different boy came up . This fellow had a pimp face . Mort ordered some ginger ale . " Y'all want the fixin 's ? " They really talked Suthun . Mort threw out , as one experienced : " Got any dark meat ? " He must have made a break . The fellow looked funny . " Ai n't no nigger gills let inside this hotel . " But in the next breath he was friendly . " Just lemme call you suthin good . Just trust me and you 'll be satisfied . She ai n't gon na sting you either . " She came in without knocking . The first glance told him it was okay . She was wearing a slimy black dress that stuck to her like a wet bathing suit , her nipples tearing to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of the plucked eyebrows replaced by a thin pencil line , he could n't tell what she was . She might have been anything from Chinese to Irish . " Well , sheik , will I pass ? " she said . " You win the hand-painted bedpan , " he sputtered . When she pulled the dress over her head , he saw the warm yellowish tan of her slain , that the plaster of powder and rouge on her face had disguised . Site raised her arms to take off the chain of big amber beads that hung around her neck . " See that ? " She held out the heads . " 1 bar 's real amber . That ai n't no imitation . You can tell by the heaviness of it . I got that a present from a traveling ratan was here las ' week . He sells them . " Amber beads were all the rage . Mort hefted them , indulgently . " You a traveling man ? " she said . " What you travel in ? " " Hats , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little game.  | " Oh , yas ? " She turned in his arms , her eyes mellow with childish greed . " Gim me see . " " No hurry . " She put the beads carefully on the chair where she had spread her dress . Did they go to a hotel , Sam and Lil , alone in their honeymoonroom ? What more would Sam get than this ? " Say , you 're good ! " he heard the girl say . " Yah . Every day I get better and better , " he cracked . Then the night became something he had never known before . Every thought , every impulse in the world seemed to stand before him , clear , divided into two component and counter-balancing parts . He thought , incongruously , of Runt Plotkin , and even the words Runt Plotkin had said about politics , this afternoon , seemed to have a component meaninghere , so closely , so joyously was everything in the world interrelated ; for a certain amount of good , there was an equal amount of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they cooperated ; for every front door , there was a back door , . and there were girls like Lil and there were girls like this , seesaw , and for black there is white , for in there is out , for up there is down --   --  His mind suddenly seemed to balance on edge , on a razor edge of pleasure , himself on one side , the woman on the other , both alive and awake to this balance , both giving and taking ! Now he knew what it all meant . He knew what a lot of fellows never got to know , what grown men who cut sourly through life never knew , what people ho thought buying it in a hotel was dirty and sad never knew , he knew life was easy , he had the password , life would always be wide open to him , front and back door , both ! I lc laughed out loud.  | Once she said : " Say , you Jewish ? " He laughed at that . " I like Jews , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Late Sunday morning , who should Mort meet in the lobby but Harry Turek , the drumnier for Stein , Lerman . Turek was a chubby bastard , a thirty-third degree Mason who had been on the road all his life . " Well , wipe my tail if it ai n't Mort ! Say ! " His face suddenlyfell , and he fixed watery , tragic eyes on Mort . " I was just gon na send you a telegram of condolences . " " Huh ? " said Mort , cagily , suspecting a hoax . " What ? You ai n't seen the paper ? " Turek wobbled his head from side to side . " Not a one was saved . They all died in the fire . " " Yah ? Who ? " " Why , your wife and six children ! " Turek slapped him on the back ; his laughter seemed hardly able to squeeze through the tunnels of fat , as his whole body shook . " You cockroach ! Has n't got his diapers off and crawls around stealing a man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , I guess you can maybe dispose of two or three dozen to Dorne , Sieffiert . But they 're pretty well stocked up . " " A 1y my my . I guess Edson Keith better close out the business . Abramson and Son is going to clean them out anyway . So they ate together and talked business , Turek , the old father of the road , handing out tips to Mort . " Say , had a good time ? " he finally leered . Mort leered back . " Boy , oh , boy , have they got stuff in this place . " " Yeah ? Something special ? " Turek squeaked . " A No. i , " Mort said . " Ask for Lil  --  I mean Del . " " Say , what 's the matter , you got so many you ca n't even remember their names ? "  | " That 's me ! " said Mort . " The answer to a maiden 's prayer . " It was an ordinary case , trivial , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law business in spite of all the yapping about murder trials that gives the public the idea that 's all that goes on in the courts . And it just happened that Lou Margolis was reviewing in law school at the time the same principle that was involved in this case  --  agency . After he saw what happened in court he knew there were a lot of lawyers who never in their whole lives got onto the law the way he was onto it now . In the beginning a law clerk goes into the city hall on routine jobs , filing appearances , and it 's like a strange poolroom . Always clusters of men talking out of the sides of II their mouths , moving off when someone stops too near them ; always the sour damp warm smell of talk , saliva , tobacco . Nobody looks natural . Or , they all look too natural : too much like cartoon typos of ward-heelers , shysters , smalltimegrafters . The chewed cigars , the spittoons , the derby hats , the air of mystery , everybody with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the know . Among all these people , never anyone that looks untouched by some dishonesty , or crudity , or lust . Then , a fellow like Lou Margolis gets onto the ropes quickly . He gets to know all the bailiffs by name , and they know him by face and who he works for , he can pass the kidding word , he himself may pause near the elevator in a low-voiced conversation with a clerk from Sonnenschein &; Barker , spilling a word of dirt about a certain judge who desertedthe sinking " Thompson ship . Or maybe it is only a dirty joke about what was found when they opened the grave of King Tut . Oh , yes , he can explain now : these onhangcrs arc politicians , lawyers , witnesses ; but how can one penetrate all thep268opaque eyes , the knowingly tightened mouths , all the meaningsof jerked heads , shrugged shoulders ? What happened was , a fellow never asked any more ; he took it all for granted . But this was a simple case . Lou 's boss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who owned the Rosevale Rest Cemetery , against Mr. Cassell , who claimed a thousand dollars for working up some ads . To begin with , Stearns owed the money . Every time the case was called Preiss would pull a toothache face and tell Lou : " Get it put over . Tell ' em  --  tell ' em a material witness is out of town . . . . " Stearns was a big client . But on this piker case he was stubborn . " Sure that sucker made the ads , " Stearns admitted to Preiss . " But I never used them so why should I pay for them ? " " You okayed them . He 's got you cold . " " I do n't care . Listen , this guy Cassell tried to put somethingover . In the first place he said he was a friend of Rube Moscowitz . " Aha ! Now they were getting to it . Rube Moscowitz was a silent partner in the Rosevale Rest Cemetery development . " So naturally I told him to go ahead with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Adam . Pete Grinnell sent him to Rube , so you know how Rube is , he says sure , go ahead , swell ! So for that , I should get stuck for a thousand bucks ! " " Listen , Nate , " Preiss would say . " You ca n't get around it . The ads were all right , were n't they ? " " Yah , but I decided not to advertise altogether . Advertisingonly cheapens the place . Every Mrs. Schmaltz would think she can get into Rosevale Rest ! Why , we got people like Judge Schaeffer got family plots ! " The case was up again . It had already been stalled for overp269a year . " Let 's get it over with , " Preiss yawned . " Fix it for this afternoon . No use wasting a morning on that crap . The corridor was already littered with dumpy NN omen in shabby brownish coats and pot hats , puzzled little men who carried their hats in their hands . These were the early sheep unaccustomed to going to court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet them , that they had come to the wrong building , that they would miss out on some unknown legal stumbling block . The bailiff was studying a full page ad for Piggly Wiggly stock , $55 a share . " If you have any change you wan na grab off some of that , " Vlacek said to Lou , tapping the sheet . " That guy Saunders was smart enough to beat Wall Street and Ford is the only other man ever did that . " " Yah , " Lou said , " but he better watch out or these bulls and bears will get him vet . Say , I got a little case here , can you move it down ? " Vlacek nodded and turned back to his paper . " Around three o'clock , " Lou said . The sheep in the courtroom would wait all morning for their cases to be called . " Did you talk to the judge ? " Stearns gurgled as they hustled across Randolph Street . " Maybe he could use a little lot in Rosevale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Preiss sneered . " Think he wants to be buried with a bunch of Hehes ? " They paused , near the elevators , while Preiss admonished his client . " Listen , chump , your only chance is to play dead . Say you never saw this guy . That dope in your office , Edelman , ordered the ads and Edelman ww as n't even working for you , just rented space in your office . Judge Morris is a good friend of Rube 's and he 'll give us a break if he can . "  |p270Cassell  's lawyer was a peppy kid whom Lou Margolis had seen around law school , must be just out . Probably got the case on contingency . Judge Morris leaned back in his chair , his eves closed . It was all familiar now to Lou , a little mumbling from each lawyer , maybe a witness on the stand , and a judgment . The face of the judge , tired of looking at things day after day , for a moment reminded him of his own father ; maybe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested the three-ball sign of the pawnbroker . Sure , his father behind his counter was like this judge , looking with the same dull eyes as people laid out their packages before him : heirlooms , wedding rings . Never anything new . That was a clever idea . Some time when he was a big lawyer he would pull it . He would n't have to say the pawnbroker was his father . For the peppy young lawyer this was big stuff . He had a thick sheaf of evidence , letters on Rosevale Rest stationery , memos from Nate Stearns 's private secretary , an open-andshutcase . On top of that he hauled out a volume of Corpus Juris , and a couple of volumes of Northwestern Reports , and even a recent Illinois Supreme Court decision . " Volume 272 , page 8o8 .. . " he barked . The young lawyer finished , stood dignified and certain . Judge Morris leaned over and said to Preiss : " As it stands now I ca n't do a thing but award them the judgment . The law is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell you what I 'll do , though . 1 ' 11 withhold entering the order for a few days , and if you can show me a law that applies , I 'll be glad to reconsider . " The young lawyer 's mouth opened , then shut . Lou himself had never seen the fix operate like this , in open court . Back on the benches , in the courtroom , there was no sign that anything had happened .... Just another little legal tangle over some kind of suit for wages . " Lou here can scratch up some kind of law , " Preiss re/assured his client . " He 's a nice guy , Judge Morris , huh ? A high-class judge too . He did n't want to give it to us without we show him the law . ... Now I want you to look up some law , " Preiss told Lou . " Anything will do . " Lou Margolis was , in fact , listening to his instructor . But his mind spun around the instructor 's sentences , as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew fixing went on . But the incident today had created a new kind of balance in his mind . On one side was all this law : Torts , Contracts , Corporations , tomes , libraries , endless files , affidavits , transcripts . A structure elaborate and fine . Once he had been blinded by the perfection , the security of law . But now he saw clearly the meaning of the old saying that there is another side to every question . Even when there was no other side . Even in an open-and-shut case . Now he saw the balance . On one side was the law , on the other side was the lawyer . It was a perfect state of balance . The result was the same as if there were no law and no lawyers , and Nate Stearns could pay his employees or not , just as he wished . Way back , almost in the first day of law school , remember how Sam Eisen had argued about the justification of defendinga client you knew was guilty ? Lou Margolis felt he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law appeared now as even more perfect than in his previous conception . Before , law had seemed a high tower : Justice , founded upon ethics , morality . What he saw now was a two-part structure emblemized in the scales held by blind Justice . There were two weights , either one of which could nullify the other . In life , if he did n't have one in his grasp , he could always have the other . And it seemed to him that humanity had deliberately developedthis balance between law and other-than-law . Every- where in life . People passed Prohibition , and then devised a vast system of bootleg drinking that balanced the law of Prohibition . In some obscure way there was a general , recognizedright on both sides . In the hallway , they ran into Sam Eisen . Lou Green snaked his books from under his arm . Sam , a year behind , was still on Contracts . " How 's the married life ? " Lou Margolis said . " Oh , fine . How 's the law business ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did the advertising guy recover ? " Sam asked . " You 're just taking Agency , " Lou Margolis said . " What 's the rule ? " " Well , he should have , unless this fellow in the office who gave him the order was acting as an independent contractor . " " Aha ! " Lou Margolis said . That was the angle . Judge Morris reached down for Preiss 's brief . " We have cited several cases under the rule of independent contractor , " Preiss began . That was enough . The judge glanced at the brief and handed it back . " Absolutely . That 's right . Independent contractor . I 'll dismiss the case . " " But , judge ! " the opposing voung lawyer- began . " Kleinschmidt vs . Sokol , " the bailiff called . Lou thought he could tell , if needed , the exact reason for the presence of every person there : the oily fellow with the face sharp as a hatchet , the thick Greek with porcupine whiskers , Preiss , himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lou felt that now he could balance the entire equation . I-Ic felt wised up . Smart . He was on . " There ai n't a box in the world that ca n't he cracked , " the vociferous but mysterious stranger announced , and Runtp273thought : this time he was in contact with the real McCoy . This time he was in a regular hangout of heisters . " This stuff is needled , " he offered his opinion , as he called for another glass of beer . The stranger tasted his beer . " Damn right . I can smell the ether . " " What is this , Spike O'Donnell 's stuff ? " Runt said knowinglyto the bartender . " Or is Diamond Joe coming into the Loop ? " The bartender shrugged . " That 's good beer , " he said flatly . " What man can make , man can break , " the stranger continued his discourse . Take a simple combination box , it was no trick at all to hear the tumblers . Well , they fixed that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the manufacturers . He drilled around the lock . They put in drill-proof plates . He made a sandpack and souped the whole door . Now they got these vaults with five-ton doors . To hell with the doors , he says , and chips through the concrete in back of the vault . " They invent a time lock , and think they got him beat , but lemme tell you , there arc a couple of tricks for beating a time lock . . . " The fellow looked around the speakeasy . Runt , too , looked around . Every man there might be a Tommy O'Connor , Runt reminded himself . The fellow decided to keep his professional secrets to himself . " But lemme tell you , " he emphasized his point , balancing one palm upward , and the other palm upward , as though he were hefting a couple of gold watches , " you can trust this principle , you can bank on it . Whatever man can make , man can break . " Runt nodded , solemnly . Pearly laid his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scooting from under the Ford . I Ic rolled over and scrambled to his feet . Sumbitch , his elbow was sore . That lousy bolt must have been put on in the days of King Tut . If he only had a snug-fitting socket . He had been under the car so long his knees were wobbly when he tried to walk . Could n't find the missing socket . Half a dozen sets around the place but that goddam Henry Ford machined his bolts just a trifle out of size so you had to have a special set of tools for his cars , or send the jobs to a Ford agency . That guy never missed an angle ! Harry took a bolt-cutter and a long-handled wrench , and got back under the car . He did n't like to cut off bolts . The idea was to make the nut cone off natural . He swung his body over , with his free hand gripping the front axle for counter-resistance . He tugged until his guts ached . The nut was frozen fast . He hammered around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on again , and hammered the end of the wrench . Twice the wrench slipped off . Grease fell into his eye . He screwed his head around , trying to wipe his eye against the shoulder of his coverall . With one eye closed , he went after it again . He tried a straight hold , bracing his feet and tugging at the end of the wrench until he could feel the strength going out of his knuckles . I here was a squeak . The nut had begun to give . The damp , rainy air gave Mitch a feeling of cool clarity . Nyquist 's lecture beckoned . Even the dopes woke up with a spark in their hearts before the bluff cracks and raw jokes of Nyquist , the traditional grand old man of medicine . Though you approached him through the haze of his reputation with a fear that no one could really be so grand , you found in the end that nothing could do justice to Nyquist , and through it all he was such a human guy ; like only the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a co-ed 's microscope , when she was analyzing her own urine sample , andp275asking in a loud , startled voice how sperm happened to be present . The old man was already in the room , preparing some sort of solution , while his assistant laid out the dog . Mitch went up to the table and looked at the animal . Already drugged , it lay with heaving sides . One leg was shaven for injections . " Observe ! " Nyquist commanded . The class stared at his brick-rough face , then down at his huge red hands , holding a syringe and a test-tube . " We have here a de-pancreatized dog , " he proclaimed . " We take a blood sample . " About his least movement there was a theatricality that might have fitted a stage magician . He injected the needle , and drew back the plunger , rotating it as he pulled steadily and evenly . Mitch could never take his eyes off Nyquist when the prof was working . Even in the smallest things , his superb , controlled technique showed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adding citrate against clotting . Then he strode over to the centrifuge , inserted the tube , clamped down the lid , and returned to the platform . " Today we will discuss the functions uff the pancreas , " he announced . Behind him the centrifuge hummed . After about ten minutes , in which he informed them that " until recently , most uff all that we knew about the pancreas was that we ca n't get along without it , " he marched back to the centrifuge , removed the tube , poured its whitish serum into an ordinary test-tube , and , back at his desk , added a dash of colorless , and a dash of blue Fehling 's solution to the serum . He waved the test-tube through a Bunsen Ilan ie , shakingit a bit as he did so . Then he held it out for them to see . Below the blue mixture was a red precipitate . The class sank back , disappointed . ; After all , they perfectly well knew the test for sugar in the blood . " Aha @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lets you catch him at his trick . " So nobody is fooled ? Perhaps ProfessorNvquist needs another lesson from Houdini . Now , please observe , we make the same test again . " But this time he preceded the test by picking up a prepared syringe and injecting half its contents into the dog . He talked for about fifteen minutes , letting the mysterious stuff work in the dog . Then Nyquist drew a fresh blood sample . With the ascending buzz of the centrifuge , Mitch could feel his very heart beating stronger . What had old Nyquistinjected into the dog , before taking that second blood sample ? It seemed that when the lid would be undamped from the centrifuge , something like the very source of life might be revealed . Then , all at once , Mitch knew . He caught the eye of Nyquist 's assistant and whispered : " Insulin ? " That was the magic word , the amazing new discovery that would change prolonged agony , and death , to normal life for hundreds of thousands of diabetics . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before his eyes only heightened Mitch Wilner 's excitement . How would it work ? What was it ? I-low was it found ? I low was it made ? " One good way to find out what something means to you is to try and get along without it . In this way you can find out the function uff a bankroll , or uff a sweetheart , gentlemen , or uff the pancreas . In 1889 there were sonic experiments by von Mehring and Minkowski , to find out what is the functionuff this mysterious pancreas . So they did not remove it from themselves , but began by removing the pancreas from dogs . The dogs did not die so soon , but they became very thirsty , they became voracious , and at the same time their food did them no good , they wasted away , became feeble , and in the end they passed into a costa and died . Perhapsp277you bright young doctors will recognize these symptoms . Well ... " Sure . Remember Harry Perlin talking about his father ? " He eats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the food does n't do him any good . The doctor says lots of Jews got diabetes . " Now , only a year later , Harry 's father could have been saved ! " . . . and most often , why , we do not know , among the Jewish peoples , " Nycuist was saving , as he walked over to the centrifuge , opened it , and took out the second scrum sample . He repeated the sugar test , and held the tube up before them . There was no precipitate ! Within fifteen minutes , the blood of the de-pancreatized , diabetic dog had changed from a plus to a normal sugar con-tent ! . .. so we have insulin ! And it is not because a few young men went into the lab one fine morning and shook up a few test-tubes . . . . For twenty years we have known that the problem is to isolate this substance , to determine the chemical nature uff the pancreatic hormone . In Berlin , in Chicago , in Boston , in Toronto , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not think any uff their work is lost because someone else has made the final discovery . Each step is used by the following worker ; without the analysis uff Langerhans , the work uff Minkowski does not come , without Minkowski , the work uff Lusk is not begun , without Lusk , without Schafer , this famous discovery tiff Ranting and Best would not be in our hands today ! " 1 lc wiped his face . " But , gentlemen , if you believe research is always going forward as fast as it can go , let me tell you uff what has happened here in this very department . " ' There was a barely perceptible change in Professor Nvyuist 's tone as he went on . The combative vitality seemed to turn upon himself ,  | rather than upon some dread disease , and also there appeared , Mitch thought , a much older man , a man who has weighed the plus against the minus , seen failure as well as brilliant success . " Ten years ago , in this department here , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extract . One day this young man came to me in my office , and he was excited . Dr. Nyquist , ' he said , I believe I have found the stuff ! ' .. . Well , gentlemen , today I confess to you . Ten years ago this student brought me an extract that was pretty close to this insulin which has just been discovered . Ten years ago in this laboratory we conducted a series uff experiments on depancreatizedanimals , and there was a very strong indication that , with refinement and experiment , this material would serve . But , gentlemen , I thought to myself : Here is a material which has to be injected intravenously three , four times a day to be uff use to a patient . How can people make use uff it ? Remember , this was some time ago , our techniques were not so good as now , and I thought that people would not be able to inject themselves so frequently without infection . And for a patient to run three times a day to a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ report , gentlemen , that ten years ago I did not encourage the development uff this material for use in diabetes . " He stopped . There was a heavy silence . " It only goes to show what damn fools we can be , sometimes , any uff us , " he said . Why had he told them this ? Among them there were fellowslike Mitch who felt it would take a long time , and a lot of experience , for them to understand the full implicationof Nyquist 's confession . A warning against themselves ? Against chance ? Against daring too little ? He concluded : " Well , now we have insulin , even little children are able to inject themselves quire safely , and perhapsthe only people who do not like it are the ladies who have to wear naked evening gowns . "  |p279His  joke lacked his usual zest . Mitch vas among several students who were up around the desk , with questions . Nyquist had stepped into his office to get them some material on the method of insulin preparation . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , picked up the syringe Nyquist had used and leaned over the dog . " Let 's give him another shot , " Gans proposed , as he found the vein . " If a kid can inject it , I can . " " Yeah ? I 'm not so sure about that ! " Weintraub exclaimed . " Hey ! What the heck ! " Seabury interposed , too late . Gans had shot the rest of the mixture into the dog . " How 's that for technique ? " he observed , wiping the needle . " Hex ! " Mitch was watching the dog . It began to tremble . Then the whole body of the animal jerked , as if to shake off sleep and death ; the mouth fell open , and the tied legs pulled spasmodically ; the animal heaved with the contraction of every muscle , while a strange , smothered noise came from its throat . The fellows watched , scared . Nyquist had returned . He took in the situation at a glance . " Glucose ! " he howled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepared in case of an overdose of insulin . Almost instantaneously , the convulsions ceased . When the dangerous moment had passed , the professor looked up . His face was clotted with fury . His cold eves looked them over , one after another . " Well , Mr. Gans ? llid you have a good time in kindergarten today ? Did you play with all the toys ? " " I  --  I did n't know  --  " Gans began . " You did n't know ! " Nyquist roared . " You have only to remember that if someone tried to inject more than a minimumdose uff brains into your head it would probably havep280the same fatal effect ! You are supposed to be preparing for the study uff medicine . ... " Mitch was scarcely listening to Nvquist 's blistering reprimandof the unfortunate Gans . More important than Nyquist'soration about accuracy and exactitude and certainty in science was the realization of the strange beauty of this that had happened with the dog . The proposition was becomingclear , in his mind , blazing in hard outline . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ substances as perfectlyand as beautifully as the two pans of a balance react to added weights . Insulin on one side , glucose on the other . If the animal was loaded with sugar , give him a dose of insulin . If there was an overdose of insulin , give him sugar . Back and forth till they balanced . The conditions of hyperglycarmiaand hypoglycemia were regulated as delicately and as accurately as the balancing arms of a tightrope walker . Then Mitch felt his mind soaring beyond and beyond , on the wings of this proposition . The perfect state of nature was the state of equilibrium , when all the forces rested , checked , held one against the other . Here he had seen it in the blood again , in the mysterious stream of a myriad combinationsand instant actions , that stream that was like a vast calculating machine in vv ' Mich innumerable different equationswere being formed and dissolved simultaneously , while their total sum always balanced . Man 's place was to find out , to measure all the forces , physical , chemical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To find the gaps in those equations of which only scattered factors vv ere known . To contain , within his mind , the balance and the harmony of the entire human mechanism ! Should she be a good little wifey and jump out of bed before her hubby and get his brekky ready so that by the time he shaved his scratchy whiskers the toast would go pop out of the automatic electric toaster ( a present from Auntp281Stella ) or should she be a modern woman , not a household slave , and sleep her beauty sleep and let him grab some coffee downtown ? Marriage is a partnership , and how could she stay in bed when poor Sam had to get up and work so hard and go to school nights all for her for them ! He liked raspberry jam . When she had bought strawberry he had n't eaten it at all , strawberries were too sweet and gooey , he said , he liked raspberry , and see , she had a new jar ! She knew this about her Sam . He liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighborwoman go into long discussions . . Well , mine , he do n't like anything comes out of a can .... Well , mine , he eats canned stuff all right but one thing he wo n't stand is a ketchup bottle on the table ... . Mine , he . . . those confabulationswent , always he ; and the other day , when the grocer had started to hand her a jar of strawberry jam , she had said : " Oh , no , he does n't like it ! " and had heard herself , and laughed at herself with private joy . How does it feel to be married ? everybody asked ; and the answer to the girls was : Oh , it 's wonderful , or , with a giggle : Try it and find out ; and the answer to her mother was a shy and slightly angry evasion , and the answer to fellows was a wise and flirting look . But what happened in bed was n't really the important thing . Lil still felt naughty when on getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But really the thing itself was n't what it was cracked up to be . If she had a chum close to her heart , she would tell her that in some ways she really had got more of a kick out of necking . Sam was terribly passionate , and one of them had to have some sense or honest he might hurt himself . And she would lie as though she were alone , and her patient eves would look up at the ceiling , and afters when he was weak that was a good feeling , having let her boy have what he wanted.  | " I bet you ca n't say this , " Lil challenged , giving Sam the part of the paper with the prize-winning daily tonguetwister . " Go on , say it . " " Seething seas sweep sandy shores shifting siny --  " " Eeee ! " she screamed triumphantly . " One hundred berries for that ! " Sam said . " I bet you could make up a better one , easy , " she said . " A minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he 'll use it in his sermon . " " Oh , Sam , I bet you could win a hundred dollars . Why do n't you try ? " He did n't pay any attention . She poured him more coffee . If she were as clever as Sam , so smart with words , she would send in a tongue-twister every day , till she won a hundred dollars ! " Oh , Sammy , " she said , " did you write that letter to Mrs. Lubov about raising the rent ? " " No , " he said . " I do n't think she can afford to pay any more . Her husband works in the Post Office and you know they have a limited income . " " Oh , so she was handing you that line ? She gives me a pain . You 'd better write to the Millers and to that Mr. Whiteheadtoo while you 're at it , their leases are up in October too . " " You know the girl is the only one working since Mr. Miller @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we could get fifty dollars for these flats any day , rents are going up all over the North Side . " " The building is paying your father all right , I do n't see any sense in making a fuss trying to raise the rent , " he insisted . He was such an idealist ! Why , on Parkside there was one place where the rent five years ago was forty dollars and now it was eighty and the landlord was asking a hundred and twenty !  | " I want to show my father he is n't losing a thing by havingus manage the building ; I want him to see what a good business man you are , " she said . " Listen , I did n't want to take this flat in the first place , Lil , I told you we could rent a place of our own . If I have to start raising the rent and being a landlord and kicking people out I wo n't do it ! " She laughed at him . " Oh , Sammy ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family was always so poor ; some tenantsthey must have been ! " Mygod , I 'll be late . " Sam plunked down his cup . " Oh gee , Sam , " she pouted , " you could get a position where you do n't have to punch a clock . " " Yah , where do you get jobs like that ? " " Oh , people who know you . . . " she hinted . As he was grabbing his hat , she thought of reminding him about the phone bill . But it would only make him sore to think of money again . Some time she would work it so he would say : " Here , honey , you take care of the money . " In her mind she had it all figured out . She would say : " Well , you need carfare , that 's fourteen cents a day , and lunch , a quarter is enough for lunch , and .. . " Oh , she would get him systematized , straightened out ! See , marrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law again and was full of ambition . " Do n't forget I 'm meeting you downtown to go to the folks ' tonight , " she said . " Oh , God . Do we have to eat there ? " " Did n't you marry me for my mother 's cooking ? " she kidded . She figured on giving her father and Sam plenty of chances of getting together , on business . Alone , Lil looked through the paper to see if Walt had proposed to Miss Blossom today . Rudy Valentino was coming to the Trianon . She could n't see why so many , girls were crazy about him with his greasy yellow face . She checked up on the furniture ads . There was a bedroom set exactly like hers at Lane 's for eighty-nine dollars , fifteen dollars more than she had paid . She went to the desk and got out the list of tenants , with the dates when their leases were up . All right ! She would write the letters , and raise the rents herself ! Between her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struggle , but they had to find each other out , get to know each other ; certain things had to be made clear : who was going to do what , so that the one who could do certain things best should handle those things for both of them . Together they would be a team , her practical nature balancing his impulsive idealism . Coming home for summer , Joe brought Sylvia one of those amber bead necklaces . Mort took a strange dislike to the thing , insisting that the beads made her look cheap and common , so Sylvia put them on only when she went out with Joe . Joe was waiting on the steps of the Art Institute . " Those beads look nice on you , " he noticed . " The color is nice against your slain , it gives you gypsy look . She decided that Joe was smoother and more sophisticated . He even noticed her hat . " Say , is that an Abramson creation ? " he kidded , and she admitted : " , Mort got this idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ w ear it . I lc has become a regular Babbitt . All he talks about is grosses and sales and how he put over the King Tut ! " There was an exhibition of sculptures by Mrs. Harry Payne Whitney : soldiers going over the top , and soldiers dragging wounded comrades ; Joe got very sarcastically critical , pointingout how unbalanced some of them were . " A man eternallyfalling , " he said . " Is that art ? " And he explained : " Sec the w in ' this figure is arrested in ap285motion in which it could n't be arrested ? You stand here waiting for him to fall . It 's just wrong , it pains your sense of balance . " He became animated , showing her how much he knew about art . " Look at Rodin 's Alan of the Bronze Age , see how he is in a pose of balance , his weight is distributed so that you feel the whole thing is solid , permanent . I mean , that is the basis of art . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off one against the other .. . . That 's what she ca n't get , but what do you expect of a woman , they never can be really great artists , they ca n't grasp the fundamental truths . " And just then Sylvia turned , with a face laughing at hiss prejudice , and he caught her movement , caught the girlscent of her ; a man might spend a lifetime trying to imprison , in stone , the impression of a moment such as this : of her turning to him , mobile . It made a lie of everything he was saying ; or maybe it indicated the deeper truth , that life-motion was at every instant balanced , and to express that liquid equilibrium , an artist would have to dig , dig to the final sources . He thought of this woman , this Vanderbilt woman , workingaway at the job , no matter how shallow her surfaces . There would never be time enough ; why could n't he be at it ! That woman could be in a studio piling up all this sculpture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe had a premonition that there would always be some shadowy frustration upon him , that the world would always be off balance for him ; he would never arrange his life , work , produce a roomful of sculptures , so much better than these . " Dear , " Sylvia reminded him , " the kids will all be waiting for us , to go to the beach . " The big sensation was when Alvin came home for the summer announcing that instead of going back to Madison in the fall he was going to Cincinnati to study to become a rabbi . A modern rabbi , of course . He had got the idea from young Rabbi Waller of Illinois , who had been up to lecture at Madison . - " I thought you were an atheist , " Sylvia twitted him , remindinghim of the time he had made a soap-box speech . " Oh , that ! Why bring up the sins of my adolescence ? " Alvin retorted . " Anyway , religion has nothing to do with it . Some of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the best way to become an atheist . The main idea is that the rabbinate is a high-paying profession , easy work , and they need smart young fellows like me ! " His folks were supposed to be secretly tickled with his new plan , but they did n't dare let on or he 'd drop it . So during the vacation his old man made Alvin put in some time in the chair factory , as if he expected Alvin to carry on the business . The Duke used all his wages to buy clothes and he positivelyslew everybody , those days , with his array of silk shirts , twelve-dollar sport shoes , and imported linen plusfours . Alvin was all set in the front scat of Rudy 's new Ford . blaring in a fancy beach-robe , when Rudy stopped in front of the Freedman house and blew his horn . Mort 's car was already there . " Oh , look , Rudy 's got a new tin lizzie ! " Aline screeched from the sunparlor window , and in a moment the whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wheel with a grin of ownership . " Say Rudv , didja know Ford bought a new factory ? " Lou Margolis remarked . " He ought to , now that he has my five bucks , " Rudy bit , innocently . " Yep ! " said Lou . " The American Can Company sold him their factory ! "  |p287Rose  Heller remembered reading the same joke in the " Line . " " Ja get rich all of a sudden , Rudy ? " demanded Lou Green . " I bet a mysterious stranger has been leaving five hundred dollars on his doorstep , " Aline stiggested , referring to the mysterious stranger who left five hundred dollars for Andy Gump every day ; this morning it was a packing box full of 1,626,642 rubles . As she climbed into the car , her slicker parted , revealing her legs , the thighs faintly downy . Rudy was explaining to Mort that , on Ford 's installment plan , the car practically paid for itself , as it would easily save him five dollars ' worth of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is going to do when he gets elected President ? " Lou Margolis asked . " Give away a flivver with every postage stamp . " " Just because he can make automobiles is no sign he can run a government , " Joe Freedman argued . " What the government needs is efficiency , " Rudy said . " That 's Henry Ford 's middle name ! " " I 'm burning up ! " Rose moaned , shifting her feet on the hot pavement , which she could feel through her bathing slippers . " Let 's get going . " " The way he licked Wall Street , " Mort affirmed . " I 'd bank on Ford any time . " " What ! That Antisemite ! " the Duke cried in kiddingserioustones . " Say , you 're a fine one , Rudy , patronizing a Jew-hater like that , why did n't you buy a Chevvie ? " " Wadyou mean Antisemite , what 's Heny Ford got against the Jews ? " Joe Freedman asked . " Why , everybody knows he hates the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bet it 's a story sonic competitors started to get the Jews to buy other cars . " " I heard Ford wo n't hire any Jews , " Rose contributed . But Lou Green testified that he had a cousin in Detroit who worked for Ford.  | " He 's been printing stuff in a magazine he owns , " Alvin said , from the superior height of a prospective modern rabbi . " The fake Protocols of the Elders of Zion . " " Say , are we going to the beach or not , " Aline demanded , bored . " The what ? " " The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , " Alvin repeated with satisfaction . " It 's some kind of a forged document that 's supposedto prove there 's a bunch of rich Jews that meets secretlysomewhere and runs the world , they started the war and everything . " " Aw for cry sake . Just some dizzy fairy-tale , in a maga-zine . " " Do you have to stand here all day arguing about it ? I 'm roasting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two cars . " Skinny , you sit on Lou 's lap , " Aline ordered . " Maybe that 'll make him stop arguing . " Aline must think she still had that high-school crush on Lou . " Even if Ford is an Antisemite , " Lou kept at Alvin , " what has that got to do with buying his cars ? The car is n't Anti-semitic ! " " A Jew-hater should get my ' monev ! " Sylvia Abramson sneered . The motor spattered into He . " Huh , self-starter and everything ! " Joe admired . " You have to admit that some Jew 's give them plenty of reason , " Lou Margolis said confidentially . " Well , anyway , some of my best friends are Jews , " Rose cracked . " The trouble is "  --  Alvin dropped wise words through glisteningteeth  --  " the Jews have a racial inferiority complex . " The other car drew alongside and there was a brief argumentabout going to the Wilson Avenue beach.  | " All the sblutmpes go up there ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , it wo n't contaminate you ! Come on , we 're blocking the traffic ! " " Leopold and Loeb did n't help it any either , " Alvin said . " They did more harm to the Jews than Ford can ever do . " " It 's a darn good thing they did n't pick on a gentile kid , " Sylvia said . " Yah . They kept it in the family , " Lou Margolis jested . How could he joke about such things ! Rose Heller felt like getting off , away from him , from the contact of his body . All summer , the headlines , the whispered details of Leopold and Loeb murdering that little boy had haunted her . Like when that terrible Fatty Arbuckle murder took place , the sick feeling that her own body had somehow taken part in the horrible scenes described in the papers . ( And now Fatty Arbuckle was at the Marigold Gardens making a comeback . ) " You know what they really intended to do ? " Alvin confided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fourteen , and rape her . At least that young so they 'd be sure she was a virgin . " " Oh , shut up ! " Sylvia cried . " Ca n't you talk about something else ! " In the other car , Aline was telling them that she knew a girl on campus , who had gone out with Dickic just a week before the murder ! Of course her name was being kept out of the papers . " Those South Side Jews , " Mort snorted . " They've-got too much money , that 's what 's the matter with those kids . They had everything in the world , money , and they just did n't know what to do next . " And when they got on the beach , the subject of the Leopold-Loeb case kept popping up among them , like lava forever boiling under their conscious thoughts . To Mort , it was just a sign of the decay of that rich South Side crowd of German Jews . Their crowd was used up , and the West Side Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusivePrima Club , where no son of a Russian Jew might enter ! But Alvin perversely championed the murderers . " The only crime those boys committed was getting caught , " he argued now , digging his big toe into the sand , the while he looked at Sylvia 's girlish breasts , clearly printed against her wet bathing suit . " If Babe Leopold had n't dropped his glasses , then their crime would have been a perfect creativepiece of work . " " You do n't mean you think there is any excuse for them ! " Aline Freedman cried . " According to Nietzsche , " Alvin went on , " whatever a superman does is perfect , and if they had done this thing perfectly , that would have been enough excuse . " " A lot you know about Nietzsche , " Sylvia twitted . " I bet you never even read him . " " Their act was no more wrong than a hunter killing a rabbit . In proportion to their intelligence , that kid was a rabbit , " Alvin said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a prospective rabbi to talk , " Aline snapped . Alvin positively glowed . " Do you believe a person has a right to kill anyone they want to ? " Mort challenged . " I 'm only trying to show you their point of view , " Alvin said . " Everybody has a right to live according to their own point of view . Just like Cellini "  --  he could go on now , to talk of Aretino , of Huysmans 's Ld-Bas , of Dorian Gray , of the beauty of evil , fascinating them with the black luster of his thoughts , amazing them with his brilliance . While Alvin talked , Sam Eisen and Lil appeared . Rose Heller , letting out a little cry , called them over . P291Lil looked very sweet in a yellow bathing suit ; her upper arms were soft and rounded , womanly rather than girlish , and her thighs had an almost puffy appearance . She was apparentlypregnant . The girls made a great screeching and whispering around her ; and Sam , flushing , entered loudly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jury in the world would have hung them ! " he declared , passionately . " Do n't you worry about Darrow . That was the smartest thing he did , waiving jury . " " I do n't believe in capital punishment , " Rudy concluded . " But in this case , I think they deserve it . " Mort Abramson , never taking his eyes off Lil 's pregnancy , said : " After what they did to that kid , it would be a crime against society to let them live . " He hinted about the secret testimony before the judge . Runt Plotkin had got some of it from a newspaperman . There were certain mutilations ... . Rose Heller got up and walked off , sisterly , with Lil Klein . Rose knew she looked terrible in a bathing suit from behind . Someone whistled : " Lank and leany Chile beanie  --  " and she heard Lou actually laugh . This was the end , she felt sadly , of her girlhood crush . " . . . Well , if they 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Aline said . " What 's the difference between insanity and genius ? None ! " Alvin cried . " How do we know our laws are right ? Why ca n't it be that just the opposite is right ? " " Is that what you 're going to preach when you 're a rabbi ? " Sylvia said , mischievously . Alvin looked directly into her eves and smiled . She smiled back . He was fighting them all , Joe and Mort and the whole crowd , fencing with his wits , dancing his intellect before her . " If I want to be a rabbi it 's because there 's good money in it and I can lie as well as any other rabbi , " he declared . And in that instant he saw himself as a rabbi , preaching moralityP292to a swanky congregation , and going around and seducing their wives ; a suave Jekvl1-Hyde personality , in whom those forces that tend toward the poles which for want of better terms we call good and evil , were always tenuously balanced , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magnets . " What good would it possibly do to hang them ? " he said . " What is the sense of destroying such brilliant minds ? " " Think of their families ! " Aline said . " If they 're executed ! " " Really everyone admires Leopold and Loeb , " Alvin maintained . " Everyone wishes they had their nerve , to do exactly what they want to do . " " Oh , you do n't believe any of that junk , " Sylvia said . In her heart , she was thinking of the girl who loved Babe Leopold . What if Joe , in one of his moods , did something wild ! But no , Joe had his work , his art , in which to release his talent , Joe was better balanced than those boys . Oh , it was better to have work to do , to have to struggle ; work was healthy and clean , like the sun-baked sand , and the water . Idly , she had clasped Joe 's fingers , and now they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. " You 're just trying to show off ! " Sylvia said to Alvin . " You just talk like that because it sounds smart . " " How do you know what I believe ? " Alvin challenged . " Well , underneath , I think you have more sense , " she said . " You 're just young . " He glared at her , while icy , supercilious remarks rose to his mind . But her face was vet so guileless , so girlishly pure , so unworried in the sun , with its perfect heart shape , that Alvin began to smile , and then she broke into a friendly , smooth rill of laughter . Somehow the instant seemed to be entirely between the two of them . Joe was out of it , at last . Alvin had an exhilarating sense of touching the truth between good and evil ; she was a part of this discovery , she was the good , justp293the good , the goodness of a girl , the pure-hearted . She was with him now . " Want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled her up , and then they were standing on the faint indentation made by the last wave . Alvin thought of this as the fine balance-line between good and evil ; the good , as man knew it , was the sun-warmed land ; the sea was the evil sphere , with inhabitants of its own , and it was constantly washing up on the land . Man could not remainlong in the sea . He felt clear-brained and capable ; he felt much wiser and healthier than Leopold and Loeb , who had got drowned in the sea . He felt that being a rabbi , guiding other people in their sense of right and wrong  --  in a modern way  --  was exactly the work for which he was fitted . Sylvia screeched as Alvin galloped into the lake , pulling her after him . Mrs. Abramson and Mort had been at the shop all evening , wrestling with the books . The old man walked around the shop , picking up ends of trimmings that the cleaning women might throw away , and sorting them into boxes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What we have , we have , and what we spent , we spent , " was his philosophy . Around ten o'clock , he shuffled back to the office , where those two had the books spread out . " Nu ? Nu ? " " I got it balanced , except for a dollar thirty-five cents , " Mort said . " Too much or too little ? " " Too little . " The old man drew some change from his pocket , counted out the money , and smacked it on the table . " Na . And an end . So it balances ! "   0N the way home from that beach party , Alvin had watched Joe and Sylvia cuddling in the back of the car , and had felt generous , giving them the free full rein of their puppy romance . Each time he took Sylvia out , his destiny seemed larger , brighter to him . He saw himself in a fancy temple , deliveringbrilliant orations , while she sat in the front row , listening . The third time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white flannels and a blue double-breasted jacket with a fancy silk handkerchief in the pocket . He had a new wrist-watch . From the empty lot opposite , he could see their back porch . It was lighted . He approached through the lot . He could identify their voices  --  Mrs. Abramson , firm and loud  --  maybe soon his mother-in-law . And Mort ! They were playing poker . Meanwhile a conversation went on about the Prince of Wales , in Chicago on his tour . " You know who he looks a little like , Mort ? " Mrs. Abramsonwas saving . " Aw , come on , ma , admit you 've got a crush on him ! " " I ! " Mrs. Abramson giggled . " What 's the matter , ma , are you tired of Rudy Valentino ? " " Come , are you playing poker or not ? Mort ! Give two cards ! " the old man snapped . " Three for me , " Sylvia said . For an instant Alvin was disappointed at the way Sylvia fitted into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then she rose , he saw her in something summery , and he knew he would take her with him to things above all this . P295Mort opened the door to him , grinned wisely , and went to call Svl from the back porch . " What 's the idea , giving Joe some competition ? " he heard Mort say . He saw Sylvia smooth herself , for him , and make a face at Mort as she came out . " My , you look like the Prince of Wales ! " she said . " All except the horse , " he bantered , nervously . " Maybe you just fell off the horse ! " " Well , it all depends who I 'm falling for . " He colored , dismayedat his flat persiflage . " You 'll never believe it but I saw him today ! He vas right on campus ! " Sylvia recounted . " No ! Can I touch you ? " He touched her arm , with an extendedfinger . But his movement was jerky , instead of light . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have seen them flocking after him ! " They vent into the frontroom . He was smirking at her , and yet his face was white . " Why , what 's the matter ? " she asked . " Listen , Sylvia , I have to talk seriously to you . " His words came in a sudden , confident rush . He thought he would be eloquent . " I know there is Joe , but listen , this is different . I love you , Sylvia . " Now banal words , not clever at all , flew from his lips , and in the very agony of knowing their commonness , Alvin felt a kind of glow at their truth . He was being just like everybody else , saving the same words everybodysaid , they must be the right words . " I ca n't live without you , Sylvia . Will you marry me ? " His confusion was so obvious that Sylvia felt herself almost drawn to yield by his sincere want . At the same time she thought : I bet he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor goof . And underneath everything was the glowing thought that this was the first time a man had really proposed to her ; with Joe it was just an understanding . He went on , in her silence : " Listen , Sylvia , I know about Joe but I think if you give me a chance you will see this is different . I want you to agree to give me a chance to show you what I really am , that 's all ! " She put out her hand . " You 're all right , Alvin , " she said . Oh , men were so simple ! Just because she had made fun of him he had to decide she understood him , and fall in love with her . " But you really do n't understand about me and Joe , " she said . " It 's more than you think . It 's  --  I do n't like to talk about it , but there ca n't be anything else . I 'm sorry if I 've got to be the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you think you want me that way , Alvin , that you think I could mean so much to you . " But now Alvin seemed actually to go to pieces . His voice shot off pitch , and she was afraid he was going to cry . " Sylvia , I do n't know what 's happened to me ! I 'm crazy about you ! Honest , I  --  I 'm  --  I 'm like a man out of his senses . I go around saving your name over and over . Sylvia , you do n't know what it is . I  --  I 'll never love anyone else . You 've got to give me a chance --  " Actually , he was going to fall on his knees ! Whv , what was the matter wit li him ! " Alvin , you must n't take it that way I never imagined you would act like this . It is n't that I do n't like v-you . I could be your friend , and --  " At that word , a kind of moan burst out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How could he make her understandthe certainty he had felt , and the sense of power it had given him ? He could n't exist , without that certainty . He begged : " Listen , Sylvia , do n't decide now . . Do n't make it final . I just want you to know that I 'm serious . " 1 hat I mean to win you --  " P297She smiled her most womanly smile . She smoothed his hand . He jerked himself erect . " I 'd better go , " he said dramatically . It was as though he saw himself from two sides . He laughed at his own posturing , and he was sorry for himself . " You think this is just a passing fancy . You think I 'm putting it on , " he said . " Oh , no , no , Alvin . Only  --  do n't you understand . . . ? " " All right . " He clamped his lips tight . " I wo n't say anything more about it . " He heard Mort coming toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the back porch ... " and suddenly felt in perfect control of himself . The Sixteenth Street Savings Bank was a cheesy little neighborhood bank where a lot of old Jews , actually old Yids with beards , kept their few dollars ; and when it went bust , of course Droopy Meisel had to have his total savings there . It was only about eighteen dollars in an Xmas Savings Account , but he felt as if the whole thing had been done against him . What was the use of scroining away his lunch and carfare money when the bank lost it for him ? He could just as well lose it for himself . So he was feeling sore , and reckless . He answered the phone . It was a squeaky , tinkly voice that asked the usual question : " Is Solly there ? " " Solly is n't home , " he said . And suddenly added the words he had often imagined himself adding : " Wo n't I do ? " " Huh ? " " How about me ? I 'm Soli @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I 'm Gloria Swanson  --  " Wadya want Solly for ? Wo n't I do ? My name is Ben . How are you , kiddo ? "   And before he knew it he had dated her up . " Sure , I 'll be there with bells on . Wednesday night . By , Grace . " Now Ben was a pretty sloppy-looking fellow , but like a lot of guys who wear the same greasy tic from winter to summer , and never shine their shoes , he had a hankering buried wav behind his ears to be a sheik , too . When a suit was so badly damaged in cleaning that the customer had to be paid off , he got it . Usually the coat fitted him like a burst potato skin , while his wrists dangled out below the cuffs . Now he hardly had nerve enough to go through with this date . What if the girl should tell Sol ? But , gee , the kind of a girl that called fellows up wouldprobably let him go the whole way with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mort , Runt , and his brother Sol , he 'd hint around  --  oh , boy , some sweet mama I 've got , I 'll say she can ! Where does she live ? Uh-uh . What 's her name ? Well  --  Gladys . A good shiksel.3 name . So there was Ben Meisel on Wednesday after school , furtivelyhauling out his good suit , a brown one , uncalled for when nearly new . Approaching the pressing machine , he laid the pants on the board . " Here , wait , let me , " the old man said after a moment of watching him , and pressed his suit for him . He had two dollars in his pocket . Maybe have to take her to a movie . The address was on Buena Terrace . Boy , was n't that the Wilson Avenue district ? Were the broads hot around there ! The hallway was dirty imitation marble . One of the mailboxeshung open , busted . Besides her name , there were three other naives scribbled on a card over that box . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the third-floor landing , a door was being held slightly ajar . " What is it ? " a voice piped , in a tone that could get mad any minute . " Uh . I 'm Ben Meisel , " he said . CONQUERING HEROES COME 299 " Who ? " " Uh , is this where  --  is Gracie  --  Miss Norlander home ? " The door opened halfway . He could see her now ; she wasblond , and she had on a lot of make-up . She was wearing awaist that showed her valley . Plenty there . Mmm-mm ! She certainly gave him the once-over . " Gracie is n't here , " she said . " Huh ? " " Gracie went out . " He stood , blinking at her . " Was she expecting you ? " the girl , woman , broad , whatevershe was , asked coolly . And that was the first moment he got the idea she was laughing at him . " Why , uh , I guess so , uh , did she say when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she went out for the evening , " the woman said , as though she were having a laugh , inside . She put her hand to hair , in a ritzy gesture . " Shall I tell her you called ? " " Why , uh , yes , I mean , do n't bother , it 's all right . . . " All he wanted was the stairs . Down , down . Quick ! Did he hear a titter ? Laughter , following him ? He stopped , and crept back halfway up the stairs , his blood beating . he heard nothing . He went down and into the street . Only then did Ben begin to feel certain that the girl he had been talking to was Gracie . She had looked him over and decidedhe was nothing like Sol . She was all set , but when she took one look at him .. . He passed a movie but it was a Rudy Valentino picture . He bought an American and got on the El and read about the Love Cult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LINDYDuring the first months , Lil had acted as though she would n't admit what was happening to her . She acted as if , in her case , the belly would stay flat under the wide patentleatherbelt she wore with her plaid skirt . Then she compromised by letting out her clothes a little , secretly , as though hiding the fact even from herself . Finally , when the little circles at the base of her nipples came alive , changed from a dried-leaf color to a delicate , transparent purple , when she felt her rising and swelling breasts all the time , she went to Lane Bryant 's and bought some maternity clothes . Before she got really big she was all the time wanting Sam to take her out . She wanted to go to dine-and-dance places , to Kelley 's Stables on Saturday night , to see the Covered Wagon , everywhere , as though she were storing up her last pleasures . Sam had to put in his evenings at law school , and at studying ; besides he got no kick out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one spot , in the dark , to the tune of the " St. Louis Blues , " and then having to pay a dollar for a glass with some ice in it . And he dreaded the chance of meeting people , kids from the bunch in places like the Stables , or the Dill Pickle Club on Sunday nights . Then Lil came to another phase of her pregnancy . She was always standing up and turning around before the girls , or before relatives . " Nell , can you notice it yet ? Aw , you do n't have to kid me . I 'm ashamed to be seen in the streets ! " She was like a two-year-old who has done something nasty in the back yard , and insists on leading everybody to it , and pointingit out . Whenever Sam caught himself thinking in that way of Lil , he would be surprised at himself , and pained , because after all she was being such a good sport about everything . But there were moments , when he was overworked , tired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from job to school to bed to job , when she got on his nerves . It seemed to him then that Lil had abandoned her own selfP30Iand moved into him , and that she would n't Ict him have a thought or a breath to himself . If he so much as got up from his reading , for a glass of water , she would call from the bedroom : " Sam , what arc you doing ? " " Nothing . I went to the kitchen for a glass of water . " When he came home from working in her father 's office , she wanted to know everything that had happened , who was there , what deals were going on , were the floors being laid in those houses her father was building on Congress Street ? Her latest campaign was to get her folks to go to Florida for the winter . " Sam could take care of the business , " she kept saying . " Pa has high blood pressure , and Florida would he the best thing for him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could do was leave his business and go off to Florida . Yet lately Lil was even talking about it as of something settled . " You can leave as soon as Skeezix arrives , " she would say . One night w hen Sam was all in , and had just answered the phone and had to report to Lil that it was a wrong number , he thought : " I did n't want to take this flat from her father , but we took it . I did n't want to work for her father , but I 'm working for him . It was n't my idea to raise the rents , but we raised them . . .. " He stopped himself from analyzing how they happened to get married . And anyway what was wrong about all those things ? They were working out okay . Then , a few months before her time , things were quieter . The prenatal calm that one heard about seemed to have settledover Lil , and she was content to sit for hours with her hands folded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed puny and short , resting on a hassock . In those long evenings there was a restfulness , a sense of order and of the calm unfolding of life , that Sam had never known before . He felt himself to be so much older , more mature , than the1P302fellows around law school who talked of nothing but Dempseybeating Firpo and Zev beating Papyrus and Chicago beatingNorthwestern , and did she have It ? He got a laugh out of good old Illini . Somehow his name seemed to have got on the mailing list of alumni . He kept gettingpep letters asking him to buy a brick in the magnificent new stadium . And now : your Alma Mater calls you ! The . homecoming ! The big game opening the new stadium , Chicagovs . Illini . His Alma Mater ! Even though he had been kicked out ! He saw himself when a middle-aged man , mavbe a judge , leaning back in his chair , telling this joke on the university that kicked him out . On a Harrison Street car , going out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sam met Harry Perlin . " Hello , Harry , what are you doing in this neck of the woods ? " " Oh , I work out here . Say , Sam , I have n't seen you in a dog 's age . What are you doing these days ? " " Oh , I 've got a job , " Sam said , not caring to mention that it was with his father-in-law . " Still going to law school ? " " yell . " " I was going to Armour nights , but I 'm staying out this semester , " Harry informed him . My . mother has gallstones and I 've got to send her to Rochester for an operation , so I took on some extra night work at the garage . " If he was n't the original hard-luck Harry , Sun thought . " Going down for the game ? " Harry asked . " I certainly would like to see that Red Grange , he must be a wonder . That 's going to be some game , one roan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were driving down for the game , Harry had heard . Gee , it would be a great homecoming . The best he could do would he to get it over the radio .   " I 'd like to see that new stadium , " Harry said with wistful humor . " I 've got a brick in there someplace . " Red Grange was the fellow that carried the ball , alone , slippingand dodging through a whole opposition team , and streaking for the goal . That was one kind of player Sam would like to watch . A single player , running the gantlet of the entire opposition , and reaching the point for which he set out ! That Saturday morning while Sam was making coffee for himself and toast for Lil , he noticed that the cover on the milk bottle was damp , and he wondered if this foggy chill day would give Red Grange the added handicap of a muddy field , and if Red Grange could make it , even through mud ! Sam was usually alone at the office on Saturday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office consisted of two cheesy little rooms over Mrs. Kagen 's drug store on St. Louis and Roosevelt . Real Estate , Loans , and Insurance was printed on the pebbly frosted glass , with the words , Notary Public in a lower corner . Mr. Klein had a sort of partner , a fat geezer named Shiffrin , who went out peddling insurance . Klein and Shiffrin , sometimes together , sometimes separately , dealt in second and even in third mortgages . Besides , they were loan sharks . Loans from fifty to a few hundred dollars at interest up to three percent a month , plus commission . Besides general office work , Sam had to collect rents in buildings which they owned in complicated partnerships ; here , and on the Northwest Side , and a " Thirteenth Street slumhere he hated to take money . On the North Side building in which Sam and Lil lived , Klein had raised a second mortgagein order to finance the construction of four buildings way out on Congress Street , as that new Columbus Park districtwas certain to boons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein owned two of the lots , Shiffrin one , they owned the fourth together . They had borrowed some money from the West Side Bank and , Sam thought , had practically borrowed from each other . The contractor was always hounding the office , threatening to quit the job unless he got some cash , and vet always accepting more notes . Klein was a little sensitive about his loan business . Only lately he had cut out the twenty-five dollar loans . Sam rememberedhow as a child he had often heard talk at home of commissions , notes due : once his mother had needed two hundred dollars desperately , in a hurry , to bring over a young brother and save him from military service in the old country . Sam liked to imagine how many times each hundred dollarsof Klein 's had gone back and forth , bringing a Jew to America . Many of the customers would start talking Yiddish , but Mr. Klein would respond in a cold staccato English . Occasionally , when a client really knew no English , Mr. Klein would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words ' would be dropped from his lips as though they had an unclean taste . Sam found , gradually , that part of his job was keeping tabs on Mr. Shiffrin , and on Miss Nathan , who was a relative of Mr. Shiffrin , and was trying to keep tabs on Klein . Each dollar was loaned , borrowed , loaned , till it served a dozen ways ; on every deal that was made there had to be a Takeoff ; if Klein ordered coal , it was : " Yah , I know , but what 's the price for me ? Do n't I get a takeoff ? " and if the contractor showed Klein some bills for lumber , Klein wondered how much the contractor actually paid . Sam had always known a little about this kind of Jewish business ; but now he began to feel the ceaselessness , the relentlessness , of this incessant squirming , gnawing , bickering . And it was a lust with them ! They enjoyed it , lived for it , could n't be otherwise . Occasionally , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large company : " That 's a one-price place . " P305Borrowing on borrowed money and lending that out to be borrowed again . And each time the sum left an increasing part of itself as interest , and vet was whole . Klein , and his friends , and Miss Nathan , and the dentist down the hall  --  everyone trying to guess how much the other fellow was really worth .... " What 's a hundred bucks to a millionaire like you , Klein ? " " Yah , millionaire ! Say , if I had your dough . . . " Well , how much was Klein really worth ? If , at any one instant , the whole involved turning of wheel within wheel could be stopped , what number would be up ? As far as Sam could figure out , his father-in-law , Marcus Klein , was on the way to becoming a millionaire . He must be worth at least fifty thousand dollars in his own right . Klein came in a few moments after Sam . The greeting would go : " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's fine . Say , Sam , did that old kizker Davidson bring in that ten-dollar payment yesterday ? " This morning there was a kind of Sabbath calm about the office , about the whole building . It was as if everybody had actually gone off to synagogues , or football games . Marcus Klein came over and sat near Sam . " Listen Sam , uhh , about 1,11 , when the time comes . . . I believe in taking advantage of all the latest things in civilization . She ought to have a room in a hospital , and they 've got this twilight sleep now , a woman hardly feels the pains of childbirth . You do n't know what it is , Sam , to have to listen to it ! " His father-in-law was only truing to help him . Yet Sam felt as though he were being treated like a kid . " I heard that stuff was n't all it 's cracked up to be , " Sam argued . " Listen , better not take any chances.Let her have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I 'll take care of it ... . " " It 's up to her , " Sang said . " But if my wife needs anything to have her baby , why , whatever it is we 'll want to take care of it ourselves " ; he was unable to keep a note of belligerence out of his voice . " I mean , you 've done a lot for us getting us started but you know a fellow likes to feel , a thing like this , he can take care of it himself . " " You know , Sam , we ca n't take any chances . Girls , these modern girls , they wo n't have it so easy . Their mothers used to scrub floors on their knees and having a kid was nothing for them . But a girl like Lil never raised a finger all her life . You know how it was with us fellows too , we came green to this country , and we had to do the best we could , without any education , without any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ easier . " He fingered his cigar . Sam was silent . " Sam , what 's the difference , if it has to cost something you can pay me back , I 'll make it a loan . " And , with his familiar rigid smile , he joked : " You can even pay me interest if you want . " Half meaning it , Sam thought . Three percent a month . " That 's all right , but I do n't think I 'll need it this time , " Sam said . " Of course I want to do the best for Lil , anything she wants . . . " " In a couple of years you 'll be a lawyer , you 'll be making plenty of bucks , Sam , this little help do n't mean a thing . " " It is n't the money , " Sam said . " l oil know I would n't take any chances with Lil because of money , Mr. Klein . But you know a fellow likes to feel  --  well , independent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Klein began to talk , as though deciding to say something he had had in his mind for a long time . " Listen , Sam , why do you go around with a chip on your shoulder ? You know what I mean , even iii business I noticed it , you talk to people as if they were against you all the time . Believe me , Sam , my boy , this is from my heart . When it comes to being friends , Sam , this is my experience : peopleP307want to be friends with people . " All the while he spoke of friendship , Sam noticed , Marcus Klein 's face wore his usual half-pained expression , that expression of waiting for small change . " You take life too seriously , Sam . Do n't worry , everything will be all right , a young fellow like you ought to enjoy life ! " His tone changed to that of a person relieved of a duty . " Hh , hh . Why , any day you 'll be passing out cigars , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Time to retire , and sit in Florida , with my rheumatism , huh ! Say , what are you going to name him ? " Their eves met , and they both felt embarrassed , estranged , wanting to be intimate and unable . Sam went to the window , and noticed it was drizzling , and thought of Red Grange , and thought maybe the real thing his father-in-law had been gettingat was that he did n't fit so well into this business , he did n't seem to get the hang of kibitzing and finagling , he could n't chortle and slap on the shoulder with the rest of them , oh , maybe he was just too young , had let himself in for things too soon . He wondered about this twilight sleep , and decided , if he saw Rudy Stone , to ask his opinion . Excuse my dust ! was scrawled on the back of the flivver , and So 's your old man ! Illini banners flew from the braces . " Yeah ! Chicago ! " the kids shrieked challengingly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the flivver and an oncoming truck , and zammed down the clear road . A derisive scream arose from the flivver . It was an overflowingkettle of sheepskin boys and raccoon girls , the redblobbedchecks of the girls glistening in the milky drizzle . The driver of the flivver yelled and stepped on the gas . Galloping with limbs all out of joint , the Leaping Lena jumped up alongside the Paige , and kept pace . " Well , I 'll be ! " Mort banged his foot to the floor . " Mort ! Have a heart ! " Aline cried from the back seat .   " Mort ! We 'll skid ! " Sylvia admonished . " Mort , we aim to see this game from the grandstand , not from the morgue , " Mitch Wilner protested . The girls in the flivver were singing : " We 've got string beans and honionsAnd all kinds of fruit --  " The Paige cut in front of them . " But , YES , we have no bananas  --  ! " Mort just missed another truck that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear to ride behind anything . He was Red Grange , and the cars that cluttered the road were the clumsy opponents , blocking his way . " I want to get there before the final whistle , " Mort said . " I want to see that guy walk all over the Maroons ! " And Mitch and Syl , suddenly full of school spirit , argued wildly with him ; they did n't even know the names of the players on their team , except the Thomas brothers , but now in the rising morning , going where everybody was going , beingcarefree and collegiate , they cried : Huh , what is one man against a team , it 'S Teamworks that counts , and they were the center of America , the core of the crowds headlined in thepapers : Corso to the BIG G ameThe sometimes endlessness of still being in school , the sometimes fear of never really meeting life , was wiped out , vanished ; in a time like this they knew that they were inside and the world was outside trying to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mort somewhat hung along , somewhat borrowedfrom their contact ; and prophetically they knew that their entire lives might be a centering back to the certainty of this fine cool rain-splashed morning on the road , when they were real college kids . Joe had been necking a girl on campus but of course she was just a pastime , compared to Sylvia . This , Myra Roth wore soft woolly skirts and wide-sleeved blouses and a real Span/ish comb in her hair . Very exotic . They had met through an argument over Shelley in the Lit course , each addressing the instructor , while in truth they were shouting at each other as if the class did n't exist . The girl had called Shelley a sentimentalromantic , too soft for this world , and Joe had defendedShelley , crying : " Whv , he was even a socialist ! " " Well , if that is n't sentimental romance , I 'd like to know what is ! " the girl retorted , and the whole class roared . So they continued the argument after class ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to start walking her around the cemetery at night . She came from a wealthy family , was sort of a distant cousin to Leopold or Loeb , and she left a vague mystery there , as though she was burying herself down at the State U , hiding from her own crowd . The bunch came running up the stairs , filling the room . Sylvia entered last , and Joe could sense how she stood just within the door to catch the first true feeling of the room , and of him toward her again . " Hail ! So you actually got here in time ! " he greeted them . " The way Mort drove it 's a wonder we did n't get here yesterday ! " Aline said . " Hey , where 's the Theta house ? " and pretty soon Mitch Wilner had shagged off to find his fraternity , and Aline had dragged Mort off ( " Give hon and dearie a break , " they heard Aline say on the stairs ) . For a moment they stood just as they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment Joe funnily remembered the little ring Sylvia had once given him , on that night when they had been to the opening of the Chicago . She was looking at the board where he was doing a joist problem , tiresome stuff . " Gee , I 've missed you , " he said , feeling far away from collegeromances , and permanent with her . Sylvia looked into his eyes , like a woman who takes a man back .   All twisted their necks to see the airplane . " Know what the stadium must look like to him ? " Joe remarked . " Like a horseshoemagnet , and all the people and the cars like iron filings drawn to the magnet . " " Say , that 's just it ! " Mitch said , admiring Joe 's imagination . " This mud is n't going to do Red Grange any good , " Mort observed . " Say , do n't worry about him ! " Joe cried , with a sudden surge of school pride . " You know what happened when they opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The home team always loses when they open a new stadium ! " Emerging out of the stairhatch , they saw the filled stadium . The two legs of the horseshoe stretched far into the mist , two streams of speckled color . Like the dots on a pointillist canvas , Joe saw the picture , innumerable dots of primary colors fitted side by side , until they made a wholeness . The Illini band ! Largest college band in the world ! In perfectranks , marching ! The Chicago band ! Wheeling the biggest drum in the world ! Oh , they could yell for both sides , for everybody , for the whole thing together , for the crowd , and Chicago and Illinois , for the planes zooming and crisscrossing above them , and the giant new stadium beneath them , for everybody and for themselves . The mob on the Illini side had all their wills bent upon that one fellow , that new star , that soph Red Grange : that he might get away , bust loose , run ! The spectators on the Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Chicago there was the desire to see this man thwart their own resistance , thwart the mud , the threatening rain , thwartP311the sky that hung heavy ready to pounce on him ; he must break loose from all , get free , run , win ! He was the sun against all the clouds in the sky ! Sixty thousand wills bent upon him ! Break free ! Run ! Win ! All eves turned following the arc of the kicked ball ; a man waited , shifting under it ; destined , it came into his waiting arms . He slipped , lost the bail . Who recovered ? Chicago 's ball ! On the Illini fifteen-yard line ! Touchdown Chicago ! Touchdown Chicago ! and Syl cried : Pooh pooh , your Red Grange ! But this is only the device of fate , to put man at the furthestpoint from his goal , to crush him under the heaviest odds ; then he must rise , the man alone , against that opposing machine , that smooth eleven-headed hammer all aimed for him ; through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever re-forming before him , tearing and dodging , he must triumph . The Staggmen thrust the ball right through the Illini line . Made it ? Run out with the tape ! Watch . First , the orderly arrangement of the players : two parallel lines , and behind each line , men placed in balanced arrangement . Hike . A new pattern , and one line shifts with the other , as though purely following the laws of design , of symmetry . Then impact , and confusion . What happened ? What 's his number ? I think it was an end run . No , a line buck . All the names they know are end run , forward pass , hit the line . Behind them two expert collegians sit and call the plays : " He 's going to try it through Ferguson , watch " ; " This is a fake " ; " It 's a crisscross . " Joe , Mitch , MOrt , too would foretell , they too would be quarterbacks . Watch ! A forward pass ! Sure enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mass of humanity arose , as if the stadium by one breath had extended itself , and one great throat howled : " He 's away ! " Then Mort , Mitch , Joe , Sylvia , Aline , Art , Butch , Nell , Bella , Ethel , Whitey , saw him streaking . . .. It 's Red Grange , it ca n't be any other , only he could do it ! Can you see his number ? That 's him ! That must be him ! The whole field streaking after . One man cut across , a tangent arrow , aiming straight for the runner . Oh , he 'll get him ! No ! A break in rhythm , a half skip , and the runner slipped wide of the tackler . They could see the tackle 's empty graspinghands as he fell . He 's free ! Oh , a beauty ! A beauty ! But they 'll get him ! Those two , waiting for him . Near the twenty-yard line , two men brought him down . Slowly in a rumbling wave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the screaming , the hysteria , faded . This too had to be as it was . Man , in sight of his goal , halted . He must rise again , and make it . It began to rain now . Darkness , mud ; the final obstacles were being flung around determined man . Now , as they settled to watch the game furthering itself , Joe began to feel , and wanted to communicate , that sense of perfect design that conies fleetingly in football games . Momentarilyone sees the players arranged as in a frieze , here a man fallen to one knee , just above him a runner with straightarmthrust out , a tackler ' half launched through the air . Sometimesan action newspaper camera catches such an instant : the rise and fall of vari-posed figures breaking the spaces of the picture , composing into a single harmonious unit . It is as if one had taken a cross-section of time , a microscopic slice so fine and thin as to halt the fluctuating pattern that is at every moment perfect , but whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought , he must compose a frieze like that , an American sculpture , of college football . Oh , all the things that he had yet to do ! The rain was steady now , an ever-falling curtain , a damp gauze being let down , unceasingly fresh on their faces . They could hear the smack of bodies falling in the mud . And in the third quarter , perfectly in the appointed time , like the rise and climax of a symphony , the moment came . Mini got the ball . All knew the ball would go to Grange . All aimed for him . A sidestep , a circle , a dance , a turn , and through for a gain . Down . Again . And down . And the third time , following the known and inevitable crescendo , the man , the hero , Red Grange , the hero , with the ball tucked close , eluding fate , eluding the rain , shaking the mud off his hoofs , knocking aside all opponents , Red Grange is away ! He 's away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , He 's done it ! he 's done it ! veering in and planting the ball . In that moment , all arisen , all reaching to their fullest heights on their toes , with their arms unflung , with their greatest voice , all are with him , and all are as one . In that moment the crowd , America , is one will of achievement , one shared triumph , in that moment love surges in the throat , for beauty and unconquerability , and the proven way of life ! Love , love for these raccoon- and mink- and squirrel-coated backs , these red , yellow , green , blue felts , these black , brown , yellow curls pecking out over pink ears , these glistening and shining girl faces and young men faces ; there is a gush of love , a sweeping sense of unity , of the goodness of life , the fullness of coming life ! Under his yelling joy , Mort knows that he has witnessed truth , seen man , seen himself conquer , buck the line , dodge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Mitch Wilner secs himself after repulse and rebuff planting his beautifully carriedout work of research square behind the goals of humanP314knowledge : here , I have brought this , torn it away from the first adversary , ignorance , doggedly fought it through the stages of doubt , finally run with it alone clear to the final conclusion . Joe Freedman sees his statue high on some proud white skyscraper ; Aline sees herself the hostess at her door on Sheridan Road ; all , sixty thousand , are lifted in triumph to their various goals . But suddenly a doubt quells them . The referee has the ball tucked in the crook of his elbow . He is stepping back . Always some sneaking trick of fate , to take away what man has rightfully achieved . They say Red Grange stepped out of bounds as he ran . On the seven-yard line . Like that , some force will always try to drag you back after you have won . But never mind . He 'll make it again . There was a false-alarm Armistice but it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fortune with Piggly Wiggly , had it taken away , and made it again . Just so , Red Grange will double-prove his right . The Maroon wall hardens . A player bangs his head against the wall . Give it to Red ! Give it to Red ! It 's his job , it 's his right ! The two teams are in one heap . He squirms , twists , worms the last inch , and he 's over the line . His face in the mud . I he ball parenthesized in his solid palms . Done . All obstacles overcome . Slowly the wild shaken spirits subside . They have seen what they came to sec . Faces in the mud and faces upturned to the rain . Nothing can stop a man . Selecting . his tiniest screwdriver from the neat tool rack , Harry Perlin bent over his workbench . I lc drove the little brass screws of the new condenser into place , and returned the tool to its groove . Eagerly , he tested the sound : ... Chicago tries a desperate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tubes sweet as the purr of a new motor :   " . .. and now the Staggmen are driving down the field , desperate , hungry for the touchdown that will even the score . . . " Some day like Red Grange he would suddenly burst out of the backfield and show them what was what . The gray weepy outdoors heightened his feeling of peacefulsecurity among these basement walls that he himself had whitewashed ; behind him , far back in the basement , was the dry warmth of the furnace he himself had tended , burning the coal his wages paid for . Lately , maybe because of his mother , Harry had begun to feel something different about the Sabbath . As a kid she had commanded him : never ride on a street car on Saturday , never even carry a penny in your pockets , it 's a sin . Of course he had dropped all that silly stuff . Yet even now , merely by changing the tablecloth on Friday night to one of thick white linen , by lighting the brass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole flat , until it glowed with an inner warm glow , like the heart of a candleflame . Now , since his father had died , his old mother had become more religious than ever ; she was always changing butchers and grocers because she suspected what they sold her was not strictly kosher . Another thing , she seemed to have forgotten all the English she had ever known , and now spoke to her boys only in Yiddish , while they answered in English . But on Saturdays , the peaceful Sabbath spell seemed to reach down like a crack of sunlight into the very basement where he worked on his hobbies . " .. . He 's away ! The crowd is on its feet again ! But that mud is treacherous ... " Right now he would have been a junior , sitting in the stands with his own collegiate crowd . The first hundred years are the hardest , and after that first lonely semester he would probably have got to know more people , even fellow s like Red Grange ; things would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the vague wild jumble of jubilant cries sounded in his ears , and something welled in his throat : As Harry passed up the rear stairs to get himself a glass of milk and a hunk of the rich yellow Sabbath cake the old lady always had on the table for him , he heard the garage door banging . A dozen times he had told Victor , next time he left the door open he 'd never get the car again . That kid took things too easy . He 'd graduate from high next semester and Harry was thinking of sending him to Illinois but he 'd have to work part of his way , Harry determined . It was while closing the door that he thought of his milliondollarinvention . All the houses were lit tonight , girls and fellows in gay laughing crowds flitted from frat house to sorority , the fellowswith their crushed felt campus hats perched over their tuxedoes , the girls with shimmering formals wisping out underthe sheepskin jackets they had borrowed from the boys ; from a veranda came a clear snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cross-eyed papa , but he looks straight tome ... And Bradley 's was jammed ; in two far corners rival gangs were trying to outsing each other with Maroon and Illini songs , but someone started " Yes , We I lave No Bananas , " and both gangs chimed in , with a united roar . Myra Roth was there , scintillating in a gang of campus intellectuals . " Oh , hello , " Joe said , and , W it h the knowledge that girls have , Sylvia drew within herself , cold , at the introduction . Later , in the shuffle , there was a moment when Sylvia was dancing with Mitch Wilner , and Joe found himselfnear Myra . " So that 's the little girl you 're going to marry some day ? " Myra said . " Sure , I guess so , " Joe replied . And suddenly the sense of doom , of limitation , came down upon him .   " She 's sweet , " Myra said with a slow parting of her red ribbon lips . " Uh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it seemed as though all adventure were moving ' out of his life ; why , he was an artist , one who should have a life thronged with women , with deeds . " So that 's your . campus crush ? " Sylvia said intimately , squeezing his fingers with womanly knowing , and forgiveness . They went out and drove , and sat in the car . Joe was moody again . " What 's the matter , Joe ? " she said . " I 'm sick of all this . Oh , why do I fool around , wasting my time ? " " You 're not wasting your time ... " " Oh , I 'll chuck all this and come to Chicago , I can get a drafting job , there is so much building going on , and we can get settled , and I can really start to work . " " Why , Joe , is this a proposal ? " she said . " No , honest , I 'm sick of it all . . . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to wait . We do n't want to be like Sang Eisen and Lil ... " Ile agreed , silently , hopelessly ; and yet he thought , what was wrong with Sam and Lil ? At least they were set . No tortured nights . But sure , first thing a kid , and tied down ... . A Child Is BornThe seven wise virgins got together in Ev Goldberg 's ritzy house and proceeded to dish the dirt . " Kiddo , " Aline inquired , " how long have they been mar-ried ? " " Was it March , or was it April ? " asked Rose Heller 's kid sister , Mae , who was so suddenly grown tip this year . " I could have sworn she was five months gone that time  --  Listen , those shkotzim arc after only one thing . " You do n't have to give it to them do you ? " Aline cracked.  --  You can trust a Jewish fellow but you can never trust a sheigetz.  --  But suppose it was a fellow you really liked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry a gentile , would you ?  --  I certainly would if I wanted to.  --  Aline , your mother would die.  --  She 'd get over it.  --  Well , it never works out.  --  I 'd go out with a goy but I would n't marry one . " My cousin married a gentile and they 're perfectly happy ! " Ev Goldberg contributed . " How do they bring up their children ? That 's the problem , " Sylvia said sensibly . " Oh , they have n't got any . " Only yesterday , two doctors conquered scarlet fever . Today , a doctor announced the cure for cancer . Every day medicine was making such terrific strides . So why should women still suffer in childbirth ? To suffer was indecent , it was putting modern woman back in the class of the squaw , Lil thought . Surely there was a clever bobbed-hair way of having a kid without all those ugly old-fashioned pains . Night after night , as Sang sat at the table , studying : " I do n't think it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What ? Oh . No , I guess they would n't give it to peopleif it was dangerous . " " Mrs. Malkin was up here today , she says the natural way is the best , but I think when such marvelous discoveries are made people ought to use them . . .. " Sometimes Sam had a peculiar , annoyed feeling that it was indecent for a woman to talk so much about how she wouldp32Ihave her child . " . . . But Mrs. Barnett told me her first three deliveries she suffered terribly , she 's so small . But the fourth one she had twilight sleep and she hardly felt it . " And she was small , too . Maybe she was a terrible fool to be doing all this , so young . Why had she wanted to be the first ? To show all the girls ? Why should they all benefit by her experience ? In another couple of years doctors would have perfected a way to make it absolutely painless . She just had to he a fool and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the doctor he had seemed absolutely coldhearted . " He did n't even make any more urine tests , " she complained to Sam . She was wondering if it would be dangerous to switch doctors at this last minute . " Sam . . . " she said . .. . Rudy was putting in his free Sunday at Mrs.-Kagen 's , when Sam dropped in to ask about twilight sleep . Old Doc Meyersonwas there , and ; flitch Wither was gassing with Rudv . " Waaal , I 'll taal you , " Rudy drawled , " my idea is , let naturetake its course . " Old Doc Meyerson suddenly burst out : " What pain , what shame ! Listen , my young man , pains they 've got , and pains they will have ! All they know now in the hospitals is twilightsleep and forceps . If the labor takes five and a half minutes , doctor , the forceps ! It 's only a wonder they do n't go in with a pick and shovel ! " They all laughed . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Sam . " Who 's taking care of Lil ? " Rudy asked . " Dr. Kroger ? Well , you can leave it to him . " Professionally : " I ' s a good man . " iWhen the pain came , Lil was lifting a cup of tea ( her mother said tea was good ) . She felt the pain like a fist clenchingwithin her , holding , slowly opening .   So she dropped the cup . It seemed the cup was in her hand just for that purpose . Sam was studying for a quiz . He rushed to the phone and of course there were no nickels in the house . The moment the nurse pulled the tight nunlike white cap on her head , and that long awful moment while the nurse raised her stone-heavy legs and pulled the rumply white stockings up on them , Lil felt a chill despair in the very center of her heart . In a hospital . Operations . Death . And as she lay there awhile alone , Lil felt tragically old , and able @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silly she had been , oh , she did everything wrong , even now , scaringeverybody with a false alarm , and why did she need a privateroom when Sam took it so bad about money , oh , and it would even have been better in a ward , among other women , or at home , but not alone in this little prison room ; and oh , Sam , I have n't been much use to you I even go and have a false alarm just when you have a quiz and need to study ; and suddenly she felt an awe of Sam , and a terrible widening love , something so immense that it would rend her soul apart as this childbirth might rend apart her body . And she thought to herself , now , at the very moment of the end , she knew everything , for the first time she understoodher mother and her father , and how they had torn their needs from the wall of life , shred by shred , to build a safe life for her ; it seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her child spread before her , and because everything was all at once so clear , Lil was sure that her end had come . You could not sec life , know life , and live . It VV as like a dread secret : those who knew it must die . Just then the door opened , and it was her husband , Sam . She reached her hand , small , squashy-fingered , damp , out from under the bedclothes .   " Sam , Sam , " she quavered , " promise me , if anything hap-pens --  " " Why , Lill " he said strongly . " Nothing is going to happen . Do n't be a sill " Oh , how tired he looked . And he had a quiz tomorrow . She saw in a flash Sam taking his quiz , tired , nodding , fallingasleep over a schooldesk , Sam never a lawyer , all on account of her . Her chin was trembling . Oh , how horrible she must look , her face all sweaty and blotchy , with those pimples along her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap betterto show off her horrible face . She clutched his fingers ; he pressed back , lovingly . " Sam , if anything happens , " she heard herself saying , " you 're young . You must forget me . I want you to  --  I want you to marry again . " " Why , Lil , why , darling . . . " " No . Please , Sang , you must promise me . Promise . " " But , Lil , honey . Do n't talk like that . Nothing is going ' to happen . " A strange deep smile of wisdom flicked across her mouth . She wet her lips with her tongue . " Sammy . My Sammy . Oh , I know I 've been a silly little girl . .. " " Lit , darling . Do n't . " His face had become soft and his eyes started with pain from under his thick brows . The lemon-pale electric light struck one side of his face , and she could see the tight muscles and veins from his ears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if at last they two had arrived at the true togetherness , she said : " You 're not sorry , about everything , Sam , are you ? " " Why , why , Lil , dear , of course not . I love you . " She let her hand relax . - " And , and promise , will you ? "   " All right , honey , I promise . " For a moment after these words he was silent as if the chill thought had at last reached his heart . " You sil , " he said . Suddenly her mouth contracted . Her pointed little nails dug into his palm . It passed . She lay deep in the cradle of exhaustion . She felt now she had done all a real woman must do . After her mother had come , Lil began to whimper for the doctor . And the nurse went away and let her suffer . Jealous old maid . Oh , where was Dr. Kroger ? He held her hand while a pain came and went , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She or the child . If it has to be a choice , let my child live . I do n't want to live ! What is there in life ? The pain was coming , she knew it was coming , she opened her mouth and screamed out of sheer impatience , screamed to bring on the pain , let it come , let it kill her  --  there ! " Give me something , oh , doctor , ca n't you give me something ? Make it stop ! Oh , doctor . " He was frowning . He did n't like her . Nobody liked her . Something was wrong . Oh , she would die . The doctor 's pink-fleshed fingers reached for her arm , turned it a little . I he nurse handed the doctor the thing with the needle . Lil closed her eves so as not to see it go in . She would show them she was a modern girl and could bear pain . She would not cry out when it pierced her . There . It did n't help at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lilly , Lilly , darling , push down , push , inside , " her mother kept saying . What did her mother know ! It was different in her time , it was easier for them , they were made different ! " Now be good . Be a good girl . You are n't being good at all ! " the nurse said , with pressed mouth . And then LiI felt the change coming over her . She hadP325been holding on tight , tight with her hands till she felt the knuckles would burst ; now slowly all the strength in her hands seemed to seep away . Her hands felt numb . And graduallythis helplessness invaded her body . Twilight , yes , like twilight , when everything , rocks and trees and houses , seems wrapped in a haze of softness and vet you know they are there , hard .. Everything wrapped in cushions of space so you walk and walk and ca n't get at things , ca n't touch them , and yet you know they are there , hard . The pain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she could no longer do anything . She had lost all control of herself . What was happening to her was happening painfullyand terribly ; she could feel the pain sharp as though she were her own twin and felt every twinge and piercing , but could not touch the hurting spot on her other self . Over her eves was an endless leaden weariness . And distantly Lil knew this was the way it belonged with her . She was the kind who would reach out for things , but in some way , all her life , a twilight sleep would be between her and the real real things that she wanted to touch . It was a protracted and difficult delivery . Dr. Kroger got very nervous before it was over . The twilight sleep did n't help any . " Well , she did n't help any , either , " the nurse said cryptically , in one of their hasty exchanges , in the doorway . Afterwards , Lil said to the nurse : " Was I good ? " " Well , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ... No , no , nobody knows .. . The street car crossed a set of tracks . Bounce bounce bounce and ride . Sang shrunk against the corner of the scat . Through the sores of his shoes he felt the stinging warmth of the heater . whether of cold , or of nerves , a shiver went down hiss spine . The chill was fear . It had begun to conic over him as he looked at the blob of flesh held out toward him by the nurse . Surely he had been too wearv , with the surging of anxiety all night , to feel any joy of recognition at the child . He had only felt : this is it . Afterwards , afterwards 1'l1 love him like a son . He had stared for a whole moment into that blob of face , trying to awaken a response in himself , and had thought he felt it coming , like a word one tries to remember . Then the nurse had marched out . And he looked at Lil . Her face perfectly round , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not known what it was that made the strangeness of her face ; then he had remembered : her bangs : they were hidden under the hospital cap . Her face , pale and clear now , had looked up to him with the strangest look he had ever seen , a look that was an utter invasion of him . It frightened him . " Did you pass your quiz ? " she murmured . And her mother , at the door , looked at him too , brimming . " Aha , Sem , aha . You see , what a woman has to go.tru ? " Her eyes were leaking . She was a sick woman . He felt a gust of anger , and pity at what this woman had done with her life . Now the fear was in him . It was as though he had just been handed the hail : go , see what you can do ! Only , it was a live child , and he had to be very careful how he stepped with it , where he landed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than the other fellows . They were just kids , horsing around , taking girls out on dates , feelingthem-up . He knew what a woman yeas . In flashes , at rare moments , a man understood . His mind reached back to a time when they had been going out . Lil had stood at the door . " Ready ? " he had said . And just then he had seen her , this small womanly figure , a short-legged creature like Schopenhauersaid , but altogether not like Schopenhauer thought , a woman standing there looking over her house to make sure the back door is shut , the gas is off . Just in that moment , in the shape of her coat , widening downward , in the way herP327two short legs were planted , he had seen Lil , and understood womankind . Sam looked up and about him at the people in the car . It had always been his habit to look at faces , to try to imagine what people did for a living , where they were going ; and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workingmen , he sensed a sameness to his life that almost overcamehis fear . Why , just after a man 's wife had a kid , he was supposed to tell his pals , who would slap his back , make wisecracks . Whom would he tell ? Smirking Lou Margolis and snickering Lou Green ? Suppose he were to tap the man in front of him , who would turn an unshaven tired face , and say : " My ' wife just had a boy . . . " Why did he have this wish to talk to people , get nearer to them , and yet find it impossible to do so ? The street car bounced . He picked up a newspaper . Teapot Dome scandal . Now they hinted dead Harding was in it too . The President . Everything was dirty . A boggy muddy world . Oh , kid , what I brought you into . Up there in front with the motorman ( Please Do Not Talk to the Motorman ) a bunch of skinny kids with unshaven downy faces were shoving and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them was trying to sing : " Old-fashioned tomaato , Long Island potaatoBut , YTS --  " while the others shrieked him down , put their hands over his mouth ; triumphantly he glubbed the final words through cracks between their gingers. we have no bananas  --  today ! " What 's in a NameRose Heller got Aline Freedman off into the bedroom , clutched her hand , and gasped : " Oh , kid ! He wants to take me home ! " P328Aline stared into her eyes with a look that said : Kiddo , I know how it begins . " Oh , Rose ! That 's scrumptious ! " she squeaked . " But he came here with Thelma . She 'll have a fit ! " " Well , let her ! Anyway they all came together in a bunch . " Rose could n't give up this chance of getting a fellow tall enough for her . He was at least six feet tall with a long face and slick brilliantined hair . His name was Manny Kassell and he was a dentist . Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was already graduated and practicing . He had a sense of humor too and he was answering everything with the statement : Yes , we have no bananas . When Aline asked him would he like a piece of cake he answered solemnly : Yes , we have no banaan ' , and when Rose asked him if he had seen the Moscow Art Theatre he said : Yes , we have no bananinsky ! That line got to be a scream . There were hardly any Jewish fellows that tall ; and if a girl did n't grab what she could she 'd be out of luck . He took her home on the bus. " 1 see where they gave that prize for naming that new magazine , " he remarked . " Twenty thousand smackers for a name ! " and whistled . " What did they name it ? " " Liberty . A Magazine for Everybody . Imagine ! Twenty thousand berries ! " " They must have got in a million names . " " It was more than a million . I even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What was yours ?

" " Say , that 's cute , " she appreciated . " You know a friend of mine just had a baby . I wonder what they 'll name it ... . Sam Eisen , do you know him ? "  | " Eisen ? Is he a short fellow ? " " Yah . He 's kind of heavy-set . " " Brown hair ? " " Yah , that 's the one . " " Then I do n't know him ! " he guffawed . " An aunt of mine just had a kid and they named him Isidore , " Rose confided . " Is n't that terrible ? Izzy ! Imagine what a kid has to go through with a name like that ! " " Know a name I always liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mygod , the names some people give their kids !

You know what my Jewish name is ? " he confessed . " Manashch . " He snickered . " Ich ! " she squealed . " Bet you 'll never guess mine ? " " Roche ? " Manny Kassell submitted . " Rifka ? " She shook her head . Her eves popped with laughter . " Chayah-Shavnah ! " Rose exploded . " A rose by any other name is just as sweet , " he said . " When I started to school I changed it to Rose . Once I changed it to Rosalind but everybody kept on calling me Rose . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said .

" Alone at home , Sam thought of looking in the Bible to refresh his mind about Jacob , after whom he was naming his son . He found the Bible that he had swiped out of a Y . M.C.A . that time when the crazy old coot who made speeches trying to convert the Jews on Roosevelt Road had got him curious about the New Testament . And as he read the story of Jacob , Sam thought : What a clever rascal , what a crook ! No , not really a crook ! EverythingJacob did was within the law . Sure , he knew people like Jacob . Lou Margolis , and his own father-in-law , Marcus Klein . See , Jacob does n't steal his brother 's birthright , he buys it1 . t.4with a mess of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hairy goatskin ? No , he lets the old woman be responsiblefor the scheme . And later , what of the flocks that he steals from his father-in-law ? Does he paint there with rings and spots ? Oh , no , technically he is innocent . He merelybreeds them that way , and lets nature load the dice forhim. , x  --  A smart Jew , Sam thought , and a physical coward too , P331hiding behind the skirts of his wives when he met the brother he had wronged . And yet , even as he saw the narrow , slippery qualities of this patriarch , Sam could not feel that it would be a shame to name his son after Jacob . For Jacob was only using his cleverness to strike back at fate for making him a second son , at Lathan for giving him cow-eyed Leah instead of the girl he loved , and fhr whom he had slaved seven years . It was as though some cord of Sam 's own body and mind grew way back into those times , reaching Jacob , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a Jew sometimes had to do , against his own best conscience , to make his way in the world . This imperfect creature , this Jacob , now stood to Sam as a kind of archetype of the Jew , embracing all the good and had qualities of the race , and lovable because he was so humanly and truly the father of all the stanch and slippery , lying , idealistic , smart , bragging , cowardly , boot-licking , and swaggering little gleamy-eyed Jews who now inhabited the earth . He could call his son Jacob . That was what Jews came from , and that was what Jews were like . Sitting alone , reading , Sam sensed himself at last an adult who could judge his own elders ; he was a man who had come upon an old family record , for the first time seeing his ancestorsas humans and sometimes rascals , instead of as the mythically perfect beings presruted to him in childhood . He read on , of Joseph , the son of that wily old Jacob , and here he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ends , benefiting whole peoples , Egyprians as well as the Jews ; and in Joseph , S.am recognized the wish of himself . He too must rise from nothing to be a power in the land , showing people how to conserve and divide their wealth ; and was n't America , after all , a kind of Egvpt to the Jews ? Look , he had made his own son into Jacob , and himself into Joseph , the son of his own son.  | Was he afraid to have his son a better man than himself ? Or , was this the way in which the Jewish strain eternally renewed itself , going back and forth from Isaac to Jacob to Joseph , mixing their qualities of loyalty and cunning and subtlety . Sam sat there , smiling with himself . And Sam Eisen did all right for himself . There was this year when the warm wet baby smell continuously filled the flat , and diapers hung on all the chairs , and Lil was a mother , and Sam felt himself driving , driving , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the top . In mock court was where he shone . He had something the other boys did n't have . It was n't oratory , it was n't superior knowledge of the law . He had a powerful sense of conviction . There was something almost hypnotic about Sam when he quoted a case , questioned a witness . He was positive . Where the other fellows mumbled their citations he shot them out like bombs . Lou Margolis stopped in once and listened to Sam . " He 's good , " another kid near the doorway said . Lou shrugged and made a wise face . " He 'll antagonize the judges , " Lou said . LawyersThe two Lous were taking Harrison 's fifty-buck onemonthquiz for the bar exam . Runt Plotkin was in a special $loo course given by John Hines , the quiz-master who was nearly disbarred because he " guaranteed " his students would pass the bar . Runt was - cramming sixteen hours a day . He was so stuffed with agent . contract , corporation , that there were long blank moments when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks were hollow and his eyes were red . Lou Green was scared . All week before the exam he hadP333been off his feed . " It 's a cinch , " Lou Margolis said . " We just have to get forty-nine out of the seventy questions . " " Hell heh , they ca n't run those exams without me . I flunked three times already , " a skinny greenish guy remarked . " Where ancestors a freehold take , the words their heirs ' a limitation make " was all Lou Green could think of . It went on and on , over and over in his head . " Lo , Plotsv , " Lou Margolis said , " where 's your pony ? " " In the stable . " Runt patted his vest pocket . They filed into the large lecture amphitheater of the IllinoisMedical School , borrowed for the law exams . " Smell the stiffs , " Runt whispered , hoarsely . " Where ancestors a freehold take . .. " was all Lou Green could think of . The words rang @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standby had been left out of the questions . He could n't get rid of the rhyme . There was a hollow clunk . All turned . A Portia had passed out . Two monitors were lifting the heavy girl , whose middle sagged ridiculously as they carted her by arms and legs . Lou stared at the unconscious girl . His mouth began to taste funny . He jumped up , and vent for the toilet . Runt Plotkin also went to the can . He settled down in one of the compartments , tool : a couple of cigarettes out of a package , unrolled the flimsy notes he had concealed in the cigarettes . He felt 1:i pd of cheated because actually he could answer most of thos questions without his pony . He took a look just to check , up , flushed his papers down the toilet , and emerged . There he saw Lou Green leaning against the wall , yellow at the gills . " What 's the matter , Lou ? " " I 'm stuck ! " and he began to bawl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known a minute ago . I just threw away my pony . Listen . What are you stumped on ? "   " I 'm stuck . I ca n't answer a one . " Runt dragged Lou behind a toilet door and began to prime him .

You do n't wan na get caught  --  I do n't know if I can make it , but jeez , you saved my life ! " " That 's all right , pal . Meet me here tomorrow and I 'll slip you the next installment . " As Lou preceded him out of the can , Runt gave him a heartening slap on the back . The next day there was a monitor in the Men 's Room . " Well , look who 's here ! " Lou Margolis exclaimed , halting dramatically just inside the office door and staring at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Moon Mullins , as though she had been in the office all her life . " If it is n't Lou Margolis ! " she said with feigned surprise . " Do n't tell me you work in this office ! " " I would n't exactly call it work ! " Lou cracked . " What happened to Rae ? " asked Lou Green . " Oh , she 's gon na get married . Didny ' know ? " " Better watch out , Celia . ' I his is a dangerous job . You 're next !

" Did you see where Walt finally proposed to Miss Blossom ? " she said , handing it to Lou Margolis . Lou Green took the Daily Law Bulletin and retreated to Lou Margolis 's old desk ; since failing the bar exam , he was on Lou 's old job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an office he shared with Preiss 's son , who had passed the bar last year . The Kind of a Girl Men Marry " What makes her so popular ?

He read in the papers of the college boys who had shot themselves , tired of living because life was so futile , and he understood them . " The only reason I do n't do it is because I get a kick out of the idiotic and asinine attitudinizing of the human race , " he wrote to Sylvia . " Puffed up w ith their little egos ... " He also wrote that he had completely got over his momentaryinfatuation for her . " The only thing that was hurt was my ego , " he declared . ' " I w , s used to getting what 1 want . But even that may becomeboresome so I ought to thank you for breaking the monotony . " Just to show how unconventional he was he suggested that Joe accompany him on a cattleboat trip to Europe for the summer vacation .... " Have you seen Emil tannings in The Last Laugh ?

" " Who does he think he is , Frank Harris ? " Mort said when Sylvia read him the last part of the letter , but refused to explain the allusion. 4 ' 1P337No more futzing around being a schoolboy , Joe swore . Look what others were getting away with ! That goofy equestrianstatue of Sherman by a guy named Gutzon Borglum , stuck up at the end of Lincoln Park  --  an acrobatic warrior on a toe-dancing horse ! He 'd go back to the Midway studio and knock out a big figure . He 'd put it in the Art Institute show , cop the fifteen-hundred-dollar first prize , and go to Europe . The work was not going right . Some+ basic knowledge was lacking . He did n't know a damn thing about anatomy . What Joe was trying to make was the figure of a typical State Street bum , sitting on a flophouse chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , dead-eyed and yet alert with that stubborn , accusatory , inward awareness of the bum . This was to be the composite portrait of the drifter , the bum , the hobo , the failure ; since childhood he had seen them sitting their days out in his father 's flophouse , smelled their butts swimming in spittoons ; and who could tell but that he might some day be such a relic of a man ? It was as though , by creating this figure , he would exorcise his own fears . But as he worked , the figure kept - shifting , assuming differentmeanings , seeming never to be exactly what he wanted it to be . At times the bum was a stronger person than himself , a contemptuous and ineradicable fellow , coming out of a canned-heat stupor with a dangerous flicker in his eve ; the man who went west and harvested , the man who was in the Herrin mine riots . Joe wanted to get into that statue a kind of lean , hard , enduringbeauty of flesh , to show the residue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like that time in his odd man 's flophouse when they had found Alike asleep with his shirt off , seen the bitten and wasted form , and vet the remaining powerful muscles of the arm , the wide wrist , and the hand that lay curled as if ready to grasp an implement . In these men who had been through the dregs , in their bodies that hadP338thrown off cold , and sores , the bite of bugs , and the clap , in them was the truth and reassurance he sought ; through their flesh the strange indestructible beauty of the human form still showed ; their faces told the final few truths : warm food and sleep . d hey had the surprising knowledge that they were still alive , after every destructive force in life had had a crack at them . All this Joe wanted to get into his statue : an old bum sitting in his chair , his bony , knotty hands ready for anything . But it seemed he could n't do the simplest things ! When he wanted to shift the position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; then when he dug into the clay and fixed the armature , he found he had shifted the weight of the entire figure ; a shift of the leg meant a shift of the rump , a different balance of the torso ; nothing could be faked ; and he was trying to take short cuts . Sylvia walked in a semicircle , looking at the roughed-out form , not yet speaking . But Joe could feel : she did n't like his work . " Well ? " he said , over-anxious . " Oh , it 's strong , - Joe , but there 's something ' about it that scares me , for von . " She had caught it , then . The meaning that this was himself , this was the end of every man . " Dear , I know I am going to sound like a Babbitt and I do n't mean to lecture you about is n't there enough sadness in life without making statues of it . I mean , oh , Joe , there is something ugly about this . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth . " I mean , Joe  --  I know how you feel about your father 's place and maybe you had to get this out , but , oh , I know you can do something beautiful . . . " Then he had failed . He had n't captured that feeling of beauty ground down , but enduring , or Sylvia would have known . P339He looked at the clay again , and it seemed only a stringy , cadaverous caricature of decay . He wanted to tear it to pieces . He simply did not know enough , yet , to carry out his ideas . It was n't that he knew less , or had less talent than the other fellows in the studio , though that crazy Indiana was a hell of a talented kid ; it was simply that his ideas were greater , deeper , than theirs , and the means that were sufficient to them were not enough for him . He felt a need to crawl into the very interior of the muscles , to make the clay express the laxity or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flesh , the hang of skin over lean cavities , to know the path of each tendon in the hand . Instead of the bum , Joe sent a little bust of Sylvia to the Institute , it job he had attacked . Damn it , he was going to Europe anyway , to get the real stuff . The car shot over the stretch of straight concrete , over the water-patched marshes , before Gary . T'liey breathed the sulphurousair of the steel and oil plants ; the flame-topped smokestacks of the steel mills were like torches to their endingyouth , to their parting . Joe watched her , in her blue bathing suit , running before him up the dune , remembering how last year , on the beach with the kids , talking of Leopold and Loeb , he had noticed the hollows of her girlish thighs . With a sculptor 's knowledgehe had realized how a woman 's thigh-bones are pointed slightly inwards , prepared to balance the added weight of child-bearing . And now , he saw , the forms were fuller , the suggestion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone , the girl had the shape of a woman .   They were settled , with a sandhill all to themselves . Sylvia had a going-away present for Joe . It was a gift edition of Walt Whitman 's Leaves of Grass . " Oh , this is swell . " " Do you really like him ? " " I 'm nuts about him . " They lay belly to the sand , feeling their sides touching , while Joe turned the pages . With the sun flowing down upon their backs , seeming to flow into their blood , one , then the other , read : " The love of the Body of man or woman balks accountthebody itself balks account ; That of the male is perfect , and that of the female is perfect . . . . " It was this , Joe knew , that was lacking in his monument . The dignity , the American vigor ... . The poem seemed , like the sun itself , to enter their blood . They pressed closer , in the sand . Surely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women .. . You are the gates of the body , and you are the gates of the soul . " Sylvia took up the reading , in her clear , open voice : " 0 my Bodv ! .. . Head , neck , hair , ears , drop and tympan of the ears , Eyes , eye-fringes , iris of the eve , eyebrows , and the waking or sleeping of the lids .. . Hips , hip-sockets , hip-strength , inward and outward round , man-balls , man-root ... " She went on , vet with a slight tightening in her voice : " All attitudes , all the shapeliness , all the belongings of myor your body or of any one 's body , male or female .. . The womb , the teats , nipples , breast-milk . . . " He put his mouth to hers , and turned her , until they layP341on their sides , pressed against each other , his fingers begging her to draw her arm out of the suit . " No , no , please , darling , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I know , I know we should . Joe , I 'm afraid . Not now . When you come back . .. " He did not understand , and yet felt he understood , she was still afraid he might just be an artist , a bohemian , who loved them and left them . ODYSSEY OF ALVIN AND JOEThe time was fair all young men of artistic sensibilities to go to Paris . On a cattleboat . Alvin said he was going over just to buy a copy of James Joyce 's Ulysses . He promised to buy one for Mort , too . And yet each fellow had a sort of secret quest . A fellow did n't know exactly what it was that he sought , but he knew it was over there , and he would recognize it when he came upon it . Every instant of the journey , he would have to be awake , alive , watching out that he did n't pass it by . And maybe it was something that could never be brought back to America , the land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , with his find . The cattleboat agency had a mile-long waiting list of collegeboys , and after hanging around for a month trying to get on a boat , Joe and Alvin finally got wise , paid twenty dollars each for the privilege of working their way across , and sailed with the next load of cattle . Alvin knew he was the weak link in the bucket brigade . With each relay , Scotty , a little bastard as rough as a hunk of knotted oak , had to come a couple of steps further into Alvin 's stretch . He 'd smack down the two full pails so that the water sloshed over into the crappy muck underfoot . Then he 'd glance at Alvin , with a disgusted stoicism that was a complete commentary on fancy-pants college boys on cattle crews . With the wire handles cutting into his open-blistered palms , Alvin staggered sidewise along the narrow passageway , the pails bumping his ankles , the water sloshing down his best golf pants . Joe was already waiting , his empties on the floor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faster . Damn it , he was acting like a baby , truing to prove himself " as good a man " as Joe . Joe came up and relieved him of the full buckets . " You should have practiced lugging around tubs of clay , it 's good training for this , " he said lightly . Alvin heard the whoosh of some damned steer sucking up his bucket of water in less time than it took to turn on a faucet . He staggered out for the afternoon trick , barely reached the hatchway , and slumped against the wall . " Sick , " he gasped . And had to spend the rest of the voyage lying in his bunk . Well , anyway , he was no laborer . In the cattle crew was a I larvard guy who was working his way to Russia . He was nuts on the subject of communism and the holiness of labor . Every evening he held forth , until the boys drowned him out singing " Hinkv Dinky ParlezVous . " But Alvin was the only one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crew were bums , and all they could think of was to give Garnett the raspberry , asking him if he would like to have his sister nationalized , like in Russia . " See , there is your intelligent proletariat , " Alvin would crow . And yet , when the fellows came in sweating , dog-tired , P343and somehow victorious from their labor , he always felt kind of ashamed . He noticed that Curtis Garnett never took advantage of those moments , to argue with him . " See you in Moscow , " Garnett laughed , when they left the boat . In future memoirs , perhaps to be called The Confessions of an American in Search of Civilization , Alvin mused , he might out-frank Frank Harris in telling of the appropriate act with which he saluted Paris . He would tell how he had had it for the first time the first night in Paris . After they had dutifully strolled up and down the Boul ' Mich ' eying all the women at the cafe tables , trying to guess whether they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel which had to be on the rue Saint-Jacques , Alvin went out again by himself . He found the cafe des Nogrambules ; a guy with a blond satyr beard told him to drink Pernod , so he gulped Pernod , feeling as though a hand were squeezing his heart , then he listened to a skinny whor brag to an old whore how many times she had gone already tonight , neuf f fois , neuf , ftn doo trwa cat  --  then he was blase and superior to baby Joe asleep in his pure white bed probably frigging the pillow , and the hell with Sylvia , whore , you are Sylvia ; then Alvin told himself he felt the Paris night like cool sequesteredfingers on his brow ; and he was stumbling along the rue Saint-Jacques with that cadaverous c --  ; then he hit the bed , but she pulled and squirmed at him and he knew she was calling him filthy names ; then it happened quickly ; it was nauseating ; then somewhere toward dawn she WAS squatting beside the bed over a chamber pot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ici , hall closet , and she looked at him with a wild contemptuous look ; then in the morning she was n't there and neither was his hundred francs , lucky he had n't cashed another check .   But later Alvin stood in Joe 's doorway , grinning a catgrin , and said : " Nell , the damn bitch cost me a hundred francs but she was worth it . " They sat beside the Dome , and inside the Select , and at the Deus Magots , where the guy at the next table might be James Joyce , at the Closerie , at the Rotonde , and they stared and made little sarcastic comments about the tourists , who stared at them . They picked up pals , who hailed them with a loud Ca va ? from across the cafe . They sometimes were in a bunch around a cafe table , passionately discussing expressionism far into the night . And maybe that was Alan Ray , at the next table , with Kiki . And yet it was like coming to a party that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Joe had to get contrary , and oppose modernism . It was crap , he said . Cocteau was crap . Picasso was crap . Everybody had a little hammer and was taking the machinery apart , leaving the entrails strewn around like a kid with a busted watch . Nobody was truing to put anything together . Alvin carried a sword-cane . He could distinguish at a glance between a Manet and a Monet , he could even tell a Picasso guitar abstraction from a Braque guitar abstraction . Then he bought a sketchbook with spiral binding , a watercoloroutfit , and a pocket full of disks admitting him to the Grande Chaumicre . At first he hid his distorted croquis from Joe , but when a little Russian in the class made a fuss about their primitivism , Alvin wondered if he might not yet beat Joe at his own game . He developed an individual style , which consisted of making a fetish of the sexual parts , drawing breasts as perfect hemispheres , with nipples like the spikes on German helmets . Then he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spear-forms , and in this way , combined with a series of sexual exploits , he felt he was freeing himself from the quaint biologicalP345slavery that had impelled his fixation on a pure girl . His latest , picked up at the Chaumicre , was an American girl , who , he said , completely freed his libido . She was a nice girl , came from a good family , but when she got into bed she was even more shameless than himself , thinking up the wildest experiments . Yet to look at her she might be any one of the girls in the bunch back home , except that she was n't Jewish . " I really was her first , too , " Alvin told Joe . " She used to monkey around with girls , but a psychoanalyst told her that what she needed was a man . So --  " " Did she need a psychoanalyst to tell her ? " Joe could make the proper responses , hand out the Paris line , but all the time he felt Paris must have something more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There must be some secret , hidden core , where the real meaning of art , of life , was known , something beneath this seething oil of I Montparnasse . And Alvin , too , felt he had n't found his goal . There was a world beyond the sophisticate cafes . There was a cabal , which he had to penetrate . Every once in a while one ran into hints , subtle leaders toward this cabal . It was whispered that Jean Cocteau conducted a Black Mass , such as Huysmans described in Li-Bas . A couple of Germans he had met , one a painter , one a dancer , and whom he suspected of being homos , suddenly went off and became monks . And every once in a while the Dadaists would confound you with a quotation from Thomas Aquinas . Sometimes Alvin fancied that nearly the whole human race lived within a world of limited dimensions , while the remaining , secret few were spiritually fourth-dimensional beings . At rare intervals one encountered these people who " seemed to live in another world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a transparent vacancy ; it was as though they lived in and through and all around mere existing humanity . One might live in the same house with them , eat the same food , handle the same money , yet all the while those others possessed some essential secret that made this same life something entirely different , to them . It was at this time that Joe and Alvin went to see Aaron Polanskv ; Rabbi Waller at the University had given Joe a letter to Polanskv and said : " Be sure to look him up . I think he may mean a lot to you . " There was no light in the courtyard or in the hallway where the Polanskys lived , yet even through the dark there came an impression of poverty and obscurity , decaying stairs , peeling walls . Above , a door opened , and a woman 's voice swooped to meet them : " Attendez ! J ' porte la lumicre . " Both had the sense of something symbolic , of an apparition in the blurred form above them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flare of light around the grave face of the woman descending the stairs toward them . As she came nearer , they saw that her black , luxurious hair , parted dead center , fell almost loose behind her shoulders ; only the tip ends were braided . " All , you arc the young men from Chicago , " she murmured , welcoming them . The man , Polanskv , was standing in the doorway of the little apartment . There were two other guests , a man named Hippolvte , birdlike , with glowing eves , and his wife , who  --  like her husband and the Polanskys  --  emanated a peculiar , excited intensity . Joe felt uncomfortable . As though he had walked in on something . Alvin felt stirred , alert . The people seemed to accept them completely as fully known friends ; Rabbi Waller had already written of them , and it was as though this alone made them intimates . P347Joe had known vaguely that Polansky too was an artist . Now the man took him into his workshop , below . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ An assortment of hammers , mallets , chisels , was laid out neatly . Polansky 's medium was hammered copper . Sheets of copper , hammered into bas-relief , stood around the walls , glowed in the lamplight . They were all biblical subjects : Abraham sacrificing Isaac , Samson bursting the pillars , Moses smashing the stone tablets as Jews worshiped a golden calf . But these were not the conventional biblical patriarchs . These were squat , stumpy little men and women , Jews with long , narrow noses , ellipticalfaces ; instead of biblical robes they wore the knee breeches and short coats of old-country talmudists . Alvin and Joe had seen such as these , old bearded Yids with ear-curls , who persisted in wearing their flat fur-rimmed hats and tight black coats even in America ; there were still some moth-eaten old Yids like that around Maxwell Street and Sangamon Street . They were a joke . But here , hammered out of dull reddish copper , they possessed a grave dignity . " This metal is like the Jews , " Polansky explained , " hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rubbing "  --  he smiled  --  " see how it glows ! " He set up before them a plaque showing Jacob , a winsome , slightly dandy little man in a tight suit , asleep , head pillowed on a rock . Above him , ' a ladder , and a flight of fat cherubs playing violins . " Aha ! " Alvin glistened . " Cho/am steel Yaakov , " He spoke the Hebrew words , showing off his rabbinical learning ' . Polansky , pleased , brought out a huge Hebrew Bible . He leafed the pages , showing them the precise passages which he had illustrated. . . . and he took of the stones of thatplace , and put them for his pillows , and lay down in that place to sleep . And hedreamed , and behold a ladder set up onthe earth .. . Aaron Polansky placed his hand on the text . " I believe in this , " he said , candidly . Joe heard the words as a statement strangely out of time , and yet true . While they had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that showed the large , bearded head of an old Jew , whose two hands were raised toward his face in a sacramental gesture . This was evidently a portrait . In sculpture , one sometimes sees a figure cast with a solid rod to its support . So now Joe had a queer sensation as of some linking arm growing from his very spine , reaching into the earth , imbeddedfar back , in time . He remembered how as a child , when strangers came to visit his family , there was always a questioning : Where does a Jew come from ? From Odessa ? Vilna ? Kovno ? Berdichev ? Lodz ? Ah , a landsman ! That question had always seemed ludicrous to him . What matter where they came from ? Their children were American born . Now , as Polansky asked where he came from , Joe knew it was n't Chicago that was meant , but some source in eastern Europe . That was the place of origin . " I think my folks came from Kovno , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Oh , then I would not know them . I come from Bialy-stok . " But the name Bialystok struck some chord in Joe 's mind ; why , Sylvia 's uncle was named Bialystoker . " Is there an Abramson family there ? " he asked . " Looking for Sylvia 's landslait ? " Alvin kidded . " They have a relative named Bialystoker , " Joe prompted . " He travels around , for sonic Jewish charity organization . " " Ah . Meisheh Bialystoker ! Then I know him ! " Polansky glistened . He pointed to the portrait of the old man , whichP349Joe had been studying . " But this is his grandfather , the Bialystoker Rov ! " Just a crazy coincidence , Joe thought . All Jews are cousins . In the conversation that night , between those four people and Alvin , Joe was completely out of his depth . The FrenchmanHippolyte and his wife were devout Catholics , Joe gathered , and the discussion was all about the cabbala , and aprocryphal writings , and branches of mysticism where the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through his rabbinical training , kept up with the conversation . Now the three men were hunched toward each other , and at one moment they all , even slick-faced Alvin , seemed to be figures out of Aaron Polansky 's plaques , dark coppery faces glistening with some inner light , hands arrested in backward . gestures , Jews , intense , disputing over the law , religious ! " Antichrist must appear first ! " Hippolyte was saying . " He must appear in the flesh . After the appearance of Antichrist , your Moshiach , or Messiah , as we call him , will come . " " No ! No ! Messiah and Antichrist must appear at once , together ! " Hippolyte 's wife put in fervently . " It is written , the two will struggle hand to hand , and Messiah wit ( overthrowAntichrist ! This must happen literally , as it is written ! We have been told the signs of their corning . The Jews will return to their land , in great numbers , and when a sufficienthost of them have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! And that will be the time for the appearance of Antichrist . It is known ! It is written ! " " My father , who is a learned man , believes that the Great War was what was meant in Scriptures by the appearance of the Evil One ; and see , the Jews are returning to their land , ever since that time , as though by the work of 1lessiah ! " Madame Polansky said with nave faith . " Ah , what are you speaking of , my dear ? Zionism is onlyP350 a political movement , how can we see it as the answer to prophecy ? " Polansky cried , annoyed . Joe was puzzled . Were religious-minded Jews , like Polansky , opposed to Zionism ? He had always thought Zionists were the most religious of Jews . Hippolyte remarked disparagingly : " The leader of the Zionists , Ilerzl himself , denied that he was Messiah , " and laughed . " But no , " Chaveh Polansky insisted , " as my father puts it , Messiah does not come as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewish people ; in returning to the land and fulfilling the prophecy the people itself is Messiah ! I wish I could explain it to you , as he puts it . He is a scholar . " Hippolyte answered Madame Polansky dogmatically : " Messiah is the name of the Holy Ghost , who , third in the Trinity , has yet to appear to mankind . Antichrist comes beforeMessiah as Simon Magus came before Jesus . " Alvin had a sudden idea . " Ca n't these two legends representthe same being ? " he ventured . " Ca n't Antichrist and Messiah be the spiritual and material aspects of the same idea , and ca n't they be united ? " Almost at random , he added : " As in Russia . " The word made a terrific sensation . Hippolyte 's eyes turned yellow . " Russia ! Yes , there the Antichrist has truly appeared ! Bolshevism ! Ah , nay boy , how can you speak in such great error ? How can the spiritual be united with the material ? " " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " They are slaughtering holy priests in Russia ! " Hippolyte cried . " And as for your Jews , they too have abandoned their religion ! " Alvin started to argue that religion and spirituality were not the same thing . Suddenly , eloquently , he found himself the champion of Russia . Why , Bolshevism itself could be understood only as a religion . And was n't its aim the samep351as that of all religions : to bring people a happier , more joyouslife ? " Oh , no no no ! " Folanskv said painedly . " True joy is the joy of purity , of humility , while the joy of Antichrist is the joy of licentiousness , the joy of the golden calf . These two conflicting impulses have always been in the story of our race ; the Messiah teaches poverty , the Antichrist teaches materialriches , arrogance , lust . That is your Bolshevik joy . And it is for the very reason that we fall into this fallacy that we are given , from time to time , a great teacher who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not been terribly interested in the dispute about Russia , but now , as Polansky went on to another tack , he found himself drawn in , fascinated ; here at last came a hint of a way of life to which he responded . " Not so long ago there was a great teacher among the Jews of Galicia , " Polansky said , " and his followers  --  the Chassidim  --  they alone understand the Jewish way of life , today . Your friend 's grandfather , the Bialystoker Row , was such a one . " He leaned toward Joe as if this incident brought Joe truly into their circle . " He was a follower of the Baal Shem . It was the Baal Shem who taught us again the joy of working with our hands . For , like Hillel , he practiced the behest that every learned man must earn his bread by his handicraft . The Baal Shem was a charcoal burner ; thus his learning was given to God , and not sold as is the learning of modern religious men . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were powerful , the fingers scarred and hardened  --  a metal worker 's hands . " The Baal Shem taught us that the only true way to worshipGod is in being always happy , in celebrating before God the joy that we take in every act of living on his earth , in breathing , in eating , in labor , in talking to one another , in walking on his earth , in singing and in dancing . "   Could it be that the old ear-curled Yids of Maxwell Street had something of this in them ? Later , Aaron Polansky told a Chassidic story showing how human joy was the delight of God . A pious old Jew had a little son who simply could n't learn anything , and was set to tending sheep . On Yom Kippur , the Jew took the boy to the city , to hear the great rabbi . " You know how it is with Jews in the synagogue on the Day of Atonement , they beat their breasts , they heat their heads against the wall ! But at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took his reed out of his pocket and began to fife . The entire congregationturned , as if to annihilate the child . But the Baal Shem reached out his hands and cried : Let the child play ! His song is more welcome to God than all your pious lamentation ! ' " " Ah , the Baal Shem , the Chassidim , " Hippolyte said . " They were such souls as God delights in . But they are few , and look what has happened on earth . Men have banished joy from the earth . People live violently , they hurl food into themselves , they get rich , they run all night after pleasure , they pay fabulous sums to whoever can make them laugh , and there is no joy . " " But whose fault is that ? Their own ! There is still life on earth ! What is there but joy ? In everything ! " Polansky insisted . " I will show you how the Chassidim dance ! " he cried and , rising , he began to hum . ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around itself , rhythmic as the sway of a scholar over the scrolls , and it seemed to Joe that he had heard it somewhere , long ago . In that small space , Polansky began an angular , self-absorbed dance : a suddenly bent knee , an arm flung out , a palm flicked upward and sideward ; head cocked , his eyes small , pointed , ecstatically smiling ; then his body turning around and around with quick sharp steps , and his hands flung one way and another , acutely angled on the wrists , all the while his humming continued , P353self-absorbed , absorbed in God , queerly and intoxicatedly joyous . " What was all this crap about the Messiah and the Land of Israel ? " Joe asked Alvin , as they strolled back , down the rue de Maine . " Are n't these religious Jews in favor of Zion-ism ? " " No , no , " Alvin explained . " Do n't you see ? They do n't want the Jews to go back there unless it 's according to prophecy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them what they cried for , and they said no . " Then if the religious Jews are against it , who are all these Zionists ? " Joe persisted . " Oh , just Jews , " Alvin said . " Oh . " " But you know , there was something in what Madame Polansky said  --  why should n't it be that a whole people is Messiah ? . . . " " Say , are you getting religion or something ? " Joe cracked " It really would be unbecoming in a future rabbi . " Now Alvin had something to juggle . He was all set to start a movement , an intellectual neo-Judaism that would cause more talk than the fancy neo-Catholicism of T. S. Eliot and all the literati . Now over cafe tables , he involved Joe in long , furious argumentsabout everything from Chassidism to Jewish art . Passing co-eds might easily mistake them for a couple of young Ezra Pounds . Joe maintained it was all a lot of bushwah . " " There is n't any Jewish art because there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He too was getting skilled in biblical repartee , and pointed out : ' " It 's right in the ten commandments ! " Thou shalt not make graven images . So how can you have a JewishP354art when to begin with a Jew ca n't be an artist and remain a good Jew ? In fact , I 'm a sinner , and Polansky is a sinner , no matter if he does illustrate the Bible . In fact that damns him completely ! There are no Jewish artists , as Jews . But Alvin said there wqs a Jewish temper , it was in the blood , it had to show in a man 's work . " What about Soutine ? " he yelled . " And Pascin is Jewish . And what about Chagall ? And even Polansky ! " " Aw , that stuff looks Jewish because Jews are in the pictures , that 's all . You ca n't tell me there 's an abstract Jewish quality in art , and that just because a man has Jewish blood he works a certain way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Athens than to Kovno . " Still , Alvin noticed , this was the one argument which Joe was always ready to resume . " My great-grandfather , " Mort mentioned to Jim Wilson , a department store man in Fort Wayne who had turned the conversation on ancestry , " was a celebrated rabbi in the old country . I come from a line of rabbis . " " That so ? " Jim Wilson looked at him respectfully . The order was clinched . " Where in heck is he now ? " Aline pulled the map out of the pocket in back of the Encyclopedia Britannica , and fought with its complication of creases and folds . She spread the map on the floor . " Ulm , " Sylvia referred to her letter . " He went crazy over the cathedral there , he says it 's the best one in Europe . " She squatted near Aline . " Ulm ? " Aline scratched her head with the pencil . Mrs. Freedman came into the frontroom and stood over the two girls . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sylvia as upon one of the family . " He says his health is wonderful , Mrs. Freedman . " Sylvia turned the page , read on .   " Well , what else does he say " Mrs. Freedman asked . " Nothing . " " In all that letter ? " Mrs. Freedman cried naively . Aline hooted . Sylvia blushed sweetly . " One thing , before he ever decides to come back , I 'll be an expert on the map of Europe , " Aline remarked . " Does he say anything about coming back ? " Mrs. Freedmanwanted to know . " First they were only going for the summer , and now it is over half a year already . Is he giving up his university ? Is he at least getting something out of it ? AIN- husband do n't begrudge him to send the money , so long as this is really useful to him , so long as he is getting somethingthat he needs there , but tell me , Sylvia , to you he is more honest than with us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Oh , yes ! " Sylvia said . " It 's very important for him ! " and through her mind flowed the whole content of all Joe 's letters , but how could she explain to his mother the alternate exultation and despondency of his moods , as he tried to swallow at one gulp the entire art tradition of Europe , and how could she explain that other theme of his letters , the sense of a quest for he knew not what , only that his instinct would tell him when he found it ? How pitiful it seemed to Sylvia in that moment , that Joe was already so far away from his simple mother that it was impossible to explain to his parents the complicated motives , /bout art , and tradition , and styles , that were actuating his journey . And at the same momentSylvia felt a compression of fear for herself , for was n't he gradually working himself away from her , too ? Would n't he be another person , a foreigner , when he returned ? " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mother said . And then , intuitively : " I do n't know if it is so good for hint . " And in this last letter , Sylvia read : " . . . All these anonymoussculptors of the cathedrals , they knew what they were doing , they were telling of their gods , and the great Greek artists were telling of their gods , and all that stuff in Italy was church stuff , and maybe that was why I was so sore at Michelangelo , because he swiped my Moses , this sounds like I was getting religion , does n't it ? But I mean even Polansky has that serenity and that purposive quality in his work , and it has made me think : what am I driving at ? And I do n't find anything at all . So you see , I 've got to knock around sonic more , try to find my way . So you see , kid , I 'm not the smart guy you thought I was , and it may be a long time before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , and I feel as though I 'll be kind of wobbly for a long , long time . Sylvia --  " She stopped reading , for fear she would cry , before Mrs. Freedman . " You know , Svlvie , my husband has a funny idea , " Mrs. Freedman offered timorously , " he says if Joe is already goingso far , he wants he should go to Kovno , the place where we come from , my husband still has some relatives there , and say hello . " She laughed uneasily . " I guess my husband wants to show off what a son he has ! . . . I told him it was a crazy idea , " she hastened to add . " What would Joe want to drag himself there to see those crazy old people in the old country , he would n't want to bother . " She waited , ready to belittle the whole thing . " Why , I think that 's a wonderful idea ! " Sylvia said . " Why , Joe said he was thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He goes back from Paris to the old country every year and asked Joe to come there and visit him . That must he near where you came from , too . " " But if he goes there , it will only take longer till he comes home , " Mrs. Freedman said , watching Sylvia . " What will he see there ? Near Kovno , it is only a little village , farms . Ah . Tell me , do n't you want Joe should come home , Sylvie ? " she asked , blushing and grinning herself . The bell rang . " I think that 's for me , " Sylvia said . " RudyP357Stone was going to meet me here , we 're going to a show . " Aline scrambled the map together , and rose . Mrs. Freedman looked at Rudy and Sylvia almost tragically , and went back to the kitchen . " Rudy , did you hear that new song , My Old Pal Stole My Gal ' ? " Aline kidded . " I think I 'll send Joe a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theater , it had to be to the greatestshow ever staged , the Miracle , and he had to have main floor seats , and take her in a cab though she would n't have minded the El ; he was so sweetly dignified , she sometimes wanted to muss his hair . " What do you hear from Joe ? " he said . " Oh , I do n't know if he 'll ever cone home ! After Vienna , he wants to go to Greece . I suppose it would be a wonderful experience for him . " " Is Alvin going with him to Greece , too ? " " No , Alvin has gotten communistic all of a sudden and wants to visit Russia ! The last I heard , his folks wo n't send him any more money except to come home on . " " That 's what he ought to do , " was Rudy ' opinion . " Front what I hear lie 's been running pretty wild aJl over Europe . " " Oh , yes , " said Sylvia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to expectations . " " I thought he had some brains , " Rudy said regretfully . " What he needs is a little will power , something to snap him out of it . You know , a nice girl would be a wonderful influence on a fellow like that . " " Oh , he thought he was in love with me for a while , " Sylvia said , " but I cured him of that . " She felt Rudy draw away , on the cab seat . Poor fellow . She put her hand near his . " It is n't much of a compliment for a fellow like that to be in love with a girl , " Rudy said . " I ca n't believe men really are like that , " Sylvia cried .   " Though with the horrible example my own brother is settingit 's a wonder I do n't get disillusioned like everyone else . " " Men are n't all like that , " said Rudy . He was glad with a high inner gladness that so far he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Joe did n't understand the purity and beauty of a girl like Sylvia , the way he knew it . At moments like that in the theater , when he had thought of Sylvia as the Virgin becoming the nun , the . illuminated purity that flooded his heart was so overwhelmingly beautifulthat he could not imagine anyone else experiencing this emotion . Rudy saw in Sylvia the transfigured being in white , the eternal nun who was nevertheless a mother , a wife ; in her was the finest expression of humanity , a womanly purity that endured and would endure in spite of all the filth in the world and all the unhappiness and injustice , disease and death . Would he ever find anyone like her ? " What 's the matter , Rudy ? " she said . " Nothing . " And then , as though she would know his thoughts if he did n't say something , he mumbled awkwardly : " Do you think Aline really meant that about sending Joe that song ? " Sylvia burst into a peal of laughter . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That would be just her idea of a joke , " Rudy said confusedly . " Do you think she has any cause to . .. ? " Archly . Oh , he was such a serious darling . " Well , " Rudy considered . " Certainly not on your part . " " Oh ? " Her surprised , questioning note trailed down into sympathy . She put her hand on his . If there was only somethingshe could do , something of the purest friendliness , to show a man like Rudy how worthy he was . And in some way she wanted to keep Rudy close to her , and Joe , all their lives .   " You know , Aline is really a lot more sensible than she lets on , she just puts on an act , " Sylvia said . " You know , Rudy , she 's really awfully good-hearted . Whv do n't you take her out more ? " Rudy looked at her solemnly , as though to discern her true meaning . Joe sat by the oven , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the letters which Shmavra had just brought from the railroad twenty miles away . But Chavim the Pest glided down beside him . " Well ? Letters from home ? Did you tell your father  --  remember Chayim ? We used to pee in the same hole together ! " " Chayim ! What do you drill at the boy 's head for ? Let him read his letters ! " Mama Dveira , pushing across the floor , screamed at Chavinl the Pest . She stationed herself over Joe . " Nu , Nu ? Read your letters ! Does he remember me , your father ? I rocked his cradle , and bang him the tsigale mitt vigale . " The pilgrimage was a failure . He had finally pursued his way , on lousy trains and broken-down Ford trucks turned into buses , through sleet and snowdrifts , to this godforsaken village , his source . Here a brother of his grandfather still kept the village inn . The inn was nothing more than an earthen hovel , where the goyim carne and got drunk . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they still cast taunts and insults at the Jew . Out of this muddy wagon-stop in the province of Kovno , Nathan Freedman had gone to Chicago , America ; there too he set up in the hotel business  --  a flophouse on South State Street . Every night since Joe 's arrival , the village cobbler and tailor and baker , and a few raggle-taggles of the Jewish congregation , had gathered in the kitchen to stare at him , mak- ing remarks about him to each other . One by one , every young person in the village had managed to pull him aside , and beg  --  did he know how they could get away ? Get to America ? A few looked at him with silent scorn , as Joe himselfmight look upon some pampered brat in a chauffeured car . One young fellow was a Zionist . He was vaguely related to Joe , being related by marriage to old Lazar the innkeeper , and he alone seemed bearable , talking to Joe neither from above , nor from below , but as an independent fellow-man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to go there for ? To sweat over a sewing machine ? Ah , they do n't fool me with their tales of diamonds in the streets . To Eretz Yisrael , that is different . There I would sweat , but I would know I am in my own land . " The rest of them gave Joe a pain . Mama Dveira was constantlyscreaming at the old man Lazar , threatening to leave him in his old age because he let the peasants cheat him . Joe had no point of contact with them . They would sit staring at him , smiling with their eves , as though , any instant , a flame of true communication would spring between him and them , and finally they would break the silence with a question about some other Jew who had emigrated years ago , and of whom he had never heard . Why had he come this far ? He went and stood in the doorway of their little wooden synagogue , but it was useless to try to imagine a contact there ; religion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent with Polansky in Bialystok had not shown him what he sought . Polansky 's family , too , had embarrassed him with overwhelming hospitality ( why could n't Jews learn to let a fellow alone ! ) though they had been less crude than these villagers . Polansky himself had hovered over him , as though anxious that he find , find , find . With the eagerness of a little boy inducting a member intoP361a secret club , Polansky had steered him into a hack-room hovel of a synagogue to see the real thing , real Chassidim , and he had seen them , a few moth-eaten old ones who looked up at him angrily , a few lean-checked young ones who swayed hack and forth over their Talmuds like the scholars in the Dybbuk , and he had heard the rhythmic hum of their learning . " A pity , " Polansky had said , " you did not see them in Simchas Torah , when they get a little brandy in them , when they dance , ah , that is something to see ! Only wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " That had been better . For a day it had reminded Joe of his childhood , when Sabbath had been a different kind of day even at home in Chicago . Before the folks got ashamed of their greenhorn ways , with their American children . That was home , home , but as unretrievable as childhood itself . All through the day , members of the family came and went , congregating in the huge whitewashed kitchen of the Polanskv home . Married brothers , branch-relatives ; the women gossiping amongst themselves ; there was the sporadic sound of teeth cracking almonds , a little quiet drinking ' of sweet home-made wine . Afterwards Aaron Polansky had slipped out with Joe , to the little synagogue . This time they had found the talmudists in their long shiny black coats . Aaron had brought a little bottle of brandy and soon they had begun to sing , the endless , spinning melodies of Jewry , di di dada dee dee di , and soon a hand clapped and a hop , a cry , a stamped foot , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began a wistful , slightly comic song that children sang : " When Messiah comes , All of us shall feast uponRaisins and almonds . . And when that was done , Aaron called the name of a song , " When the Rabbi Sleeps . " Ah , this , he w whispercd to Joe , was a real hit of Chassidic humor , showing the lightness , the joyP362of their way of life . A skinny , conic-eyed old one got up to lead the song . IIe intoned the first line : " When the rabbi sleeps ... " and snored a great snore . All responded : " Then all his ChassidimAlso sleep ! " and they snored hugely . The leader sang : " When the rabbi sneezesKaachoo ! " And they responded : " Then all his ChassidimAlso sneezeKaachoo ! " The leader sang : " When the rabbi dances .. He shook a leg . " Then all his ChassidimDance with him ! " They leapt up , and began dancing again , flinging their feet , turning their palms , singing as they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past , a show ; on the streets of the town the young Jews wore suits ready-made from America . One thing more Joe had had to do : visit the Bialvstoker Roy . The importance of this synagogue had diminished a great deal since the death of the Great Bialvstoker Roy , and in a way Joe was relieved to learn that the present rabbi was related to the Abramsons only in the complicated , distant way of Jewry . Polansky conducted Joe to the house of the rabbi . It was a large house , filled with people , whispering , haggling : " When will he see us ? " " Did you ask him for the decision in Meyer 's case ? " " They say Meyer has slipped the shamas aP363few zloty . .. " A house with a strange air of intrigue , of kotowing , of fear , and of power . " I must tell You , " Aaron Polansky whispered apologetically , " among the Chassidim too things have changed ; the true , humble Chassidim are very few . As you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept gifts for every piece of advice , for every favor . . . it is not as it was . " Now Joe saw that all this pained Aaron , the apostle of Chassidism . Perhaps he had been living in a memory , and the coming of a guest was forcing him to sec things as they were . Joe felt somewhat guilty , at having brought this disturbance into the artist 's life . Finally , the holy man , attended by several stout Chassidim with glittering , voracious eves , passed into the room where he gave audience . He spied Polansky and leaned patronizinglytoward him : " Ah ? " " A friend , a young man from America , " Polansky presentedJoe . It was an absurd moment ; could it be that he had come all this way for this ? And suddenly Joe knew what this man , what this crowd was like . It was like the crowd around Rube Moscowitz . The rabbi of Bialystok breathed in his face , patted his cheek . " T icy are not so pious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The young folk , especially . " " No . Brit I have a friend who is studying to be a rabbi , " Joe managed . The rabbi waggled his head . " Yes ? Then perhaps America is not yet lost , " he jested , patting Joe 's checks again as he passed on to settle a dispute about the sale of a lace factory . That was where Svl had come from . And here in this squalid , earthen-floored hovel of an inn , was where he had come from , himself . Alvin was in Berlin when his folks cabled : " Mother having operation come home . " He figured it was just a trick to keep him from going to Russia , but still it might be true . His mother was always chasing around to specialists , fearing she had a cancer . The last letter had contained a hysterical warningfrom her , he could just see her dictating it to his father 's secretary , over the phone : Tell him he should n't go to the Bolsheviki , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is a fever there , what is there to see in Russia , we all ran away from there ! And they had sent no more money , only a ticket home . Well , if he had guts he could still go . You did n't need money in Russia . If he went , it would have to be entirely on his own . Alvin puffed at the Dunhill he had bought in Paris . He studied the cable . Maybe his mother really was going to have a critical operation ... . Joe stood on the rim of the hillside . He was utterly alone , with these stones . And here , perhaps , he was home . Surges and surges of elation coursed through his heart . For here was the miracle of complete-harmony , the work of man mated to nature , singing with the tranquillity , the eternity , of time . The coursing of the stones along the hollow hillsidewas sweet to him , and the velvet grass , softening each edge and crevice , was intended so to he , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the slope of the amphitheater , to the pedestal that still stood in the center of the circle . Dionysian  --  the word came to hint  --  godlike ! Oh , these were people ! He thought of the sculptures that adorned and were part of their temples , the tranquil , eternal smile of all their gods and goddesses ! and these were the people who had truly known joy , a constant , harmonized joy , in every act of living : in breathing , walking , eating , and making love . And this was why he had so worshiped that classic building in Jackson Park , in Chicago ; it had been his first hint of this truth that was here . What more could there be than this ?  |p365For  an instant Joe hesitated , with a vague , uneasy feeling that perhaps he was avoiding destiny . Perhaps he should go on : Palestine was just a day , directly across the sea . A Jewish sculptor , in the Jovish land . He walked down a lane of trees . Here had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and here a temple to the god of health , AEsculapius . Joe could almost see the patients in their white garments strolling among the white buildings , breathing this health-giving air . Through the grove they walked to the amphitheater and watched the dancing that was like sculpture . Some sculptures still remained in Epidaurus , and in the excited clarity that had come over his mind , Joe saw , and wondered why he had never realized before , that here in Greece the two things that he had wanted to do were one , sculpture and architecture were a part of each other . As he was standing there , a gray and stubble-headed native came along , perhaps the caretaker of this place . " You American ? " " Yes . " The native 's eves lit up . " You know Chicago ? " " I come from Chicagyh . " " That so ! I was live in Chicago ! Thirty year ! " He stared at Joe with strange , unblinking eyes ; as though a deep communityhad been established . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You know  --  Harrison Street ? " " Yah . " The Greek seemed flooded with happiness . " You know  --  Blue Island Avenue ? " " Sure , " Joe said . " I was born and raised in Chicago . " " Blue Island Avenue , " the Greek repeated tenderly . " I usta have my candy store , nine eighteen Blue Island Avenue , that 's thirty year . " He confided : " I was save a little money ,   so I come back to the old country to see my people ; I am retire . " He peered at Joe . " What place you live ? " " I used to live on Independence Boulevard , that 's near Roosevelt Road . " " Roosavelt Road ? " " It used to be called Twelfth Street . " " Oh , sure , Twelve Street , sure , sure , " nodding and nodding , happily . " Blue Island Avenue , that hit Twelve Street , not far from where I have my store . Blue Island Avenue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " and , as two Americans meeting , he offered his gnarled hand . " Blue Island Avenue , " Joe repeated , smiling , as the old Greek pattered away . He would make American sculptures , to go on modern skyscrapers . Stopping in Athens , Joe thought perhaps after all he 'd go across for a look at Palestine , before leaving for home . But in a hotel in Athens he found an old rotogravure from the Chicago Sunday Tribune , and on the front page was a colorphoto of the co-eds in the U. of C. graduating class . Precisely in the center of the front row , as if placed there by the photographer to light up his picture , stood Sylvia . She wore a yellow dress , and was smiling . A fellow thought he was deeply changed . He had been half around the world . But when he got on the Garfield Park El , there was the same ad for Sloan 's Liniment . He might have just gone downtown on the El this morning and be coming back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stores with the white scrawled prices on their windows , Joe had his first misgiving . What had he brought back after all ? Oh , he had deeper , broader ideas , about Judaism , classicism , but wasn'tp367he like someone who had rushed to a store and bought the wrong things ? How would they help him in this life , in Chicago ? There she was , coming out the door as always , waiting for him at the landing as he ran up the same old flight of stairs . " Miss vier " Uh huh . " They sat in a glowing stupor . Was this all , the end of life , Ulysses conic home from his wandering ? " Look what 1 brought . " He had unwrapped the copper portrait of the Bialystoker Rov , a gift from Aaron Polansky . The folks all came in ; they stood the plaque on the piano , and admired it . Joe felt awkwardly half included in the family . " Did he really look like that ? " Syl kidded her father . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I was born , I never saw him . " " I bet there never was a Bialystoker Rov ! " Syl joked . " Oh , yah ? " said Mort . " Say , he was one of the most famousrabbis in the old country . " " Mv , is Mort getting religious ! You ought to see him , Joe , he goes all over the West Side hunting for real Chassidim , with beards ! " " Yah , I give a quarter a piece for them , " Mort said . " How about growing some pay ess ? " Sylvia suggested , pointing to the orthodox ear-curls on the portrait . Mrs. Abramson brought the brass candlesticks and placedthem near the plaque . " The family shrine , " Mort remarked . The folks left them alone again . Joe caught the sound of Aloft and Mrs.:Abrannon talking in the dining room . There 1 as a vv arv , disturbed note in Mrs. Abramson 's voice . He caught the words : " What 's he going to do now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was make money . Everything hinged on that . Everybody was watching him , expecting something of him . Now they regarded him as all set , graduated , back from a European training . It had been bad enough to have to live on the folks until now , but now it might be years before he could conic through as a sculptor and he would n't let himself be hounded by dependence on them , by the thought of their worrying about their poor artist son . ' What he needed was a way to make a stake that would give him a couple of years of clear independence . He slouched on the sofa , brooding . One of Aline 's flapper dolls , enflounced in an elaborate taffeta dress , sat upon a frilled silk pillow . He flicked his thumb against the face of the doll . Silk and glue . He thought : why not make novelty dolls , with caricature heads of famous people , Charlie Chaplin , Red Grange , Gloria Swanson , Pola Negri , to take the place of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make . Just a couple of long scams and a little cotton stuffing . Why , there must be a fortune in this stuff . Every home had a couple of dolls sitting on the davenport , the piano , the radiators , the beds . All with these vacant , pretty faces , puckered mouths , reminding him somewhatof Aline . A line of dolls with some pep in them ought to cop all the business . He would clean up on the idea ! And then he 'd be able to do whatever he wanted . " What is he making , is he making anything on those dolls ? " Mr. Abramson said uninterestedly , stretching out on the couch . " Maybe he will make a little something . Sylvie said he got an order from Field 's , " Mrs. Abramson said , her tone showingshe hoped more than she believed .   " A couple of dozen , " Mort specified . " He 'll never get anywhere with that stuff . " " They are cute dolls , " Mrs. Abramson said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ah , he do n't know how to go about it , " Mort said . " He makes them too expensive . He 's got some crazy idea he has to make them all himself , by hand . ... " " He even had Sylvia sewing on them , " Mrs. Abramson said , dubiously . " Kindershpiel ! " Mr. Abramson snorted . " What is he goingto do , that boy ? She could have plenty of fine boys , doctors . That Rudy is a fine boy ! " " Well , Joe may be a famous sculptor some day . " Mort was respectful . A great artist in the family . " He is very talented , " Mrs. Abramson agreed . " But who knows . . . ? " Then she added : " They love each other . " Mort remarked : " ' Anyway , people cleaned up on those boudoir dolls , and Joe 's got a new idea on it . " " It 's a fad , it 's finished already , " Mr. Abramson said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the novelty business . He says they can get them twenty-five dollars a gross . " " I told him he ought to hire a couple of sbiksehs for thirty cents an hour , then he 'd have some time to go around and get orders . " Mort made a face . " He do n't understand busi-ness . " " I do n't understand him , " Mrs. Abramson said . " Why did n't he finish architecture ? " Mort made a Jewish shrug : " He has to be a sculptor . " " Is this his sculpture , to make dolls ? " " Well , I guess he wants a business to fall back cm . What do you expect him to do , take over his old man 's flophouse ? " They were silent , thinking of Sylvia 's future . " Wait , wait , " Mort said , " we 'll have Ii iii in the family yet , designing hats . "   " Sylvia do n't say anything , " Mrs. Abramson complained . " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She do n't know herself , " Mort surmised . Sylvia came in . There was a hush . Mrs. Abramson picked up the News . " Look , they 're fainting like flies at Rudy Valentino 's funeral ! Pola Negri fainted ! " " Why should n't she faint ? " Mort said . " It 's good pub-licitv . " " Mort , why do you have to be so cynical ? " Sylvia complained . " Maybe Pola Negri was really in love with him . Some people have feelings , Mort . " There were times like this late November day . Joe was working in the little frame house he had rented on Erie Street . He had dubbed it the Doll 's House . Now he had a fire going in the old-fashioned nickelplatedparlor stove ; the panes in the front of the stove glowed orange . The floor was littered with kapok . Heads of dolls , in all stages of drying and painting , were on the long table , and set around the stove . Sylvia sat by the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dolls . Bits of silver cloth , oilcloth , leatherette , and the various other fabrics which Joe could n't resist buying , on the chance they would make up into modernistic dolls , were scattered around her . Joe caught a sweet , slow breath of home . Maybe it was the glowing stove , touching far back into his childhood , when there had been such a stove in the frontroom . Maybe it was because Sylvia sat in the position so utterly suggestive of home , and peace : a woman sewing . He pried the little mask out of its mold , and sat on a stool , touching up the face with fine sandpaper , sharpening the features with a carving tool . As he sat there working with his hands , earning his living , he understood the happiness Polan-albP371sky got out of having found a medium that was a craft as well as an art ; and though this was scarcely an art , the work gave him a sense of being one with a whole line of people , with a fine and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apiece for the dolls , which the store was selling for two dollars , undressed . He had thought that once he got all the molds set and the work systematized he could turn out maybe fifty a day , just himself and a helper , but what with running to the hardware store for plaster , and downtown for special glue , what with finishing and polishing and wig 's and this and that , he averaged about fifty a week , and out of that went expenses . " Is this the way you want it ? Have I stuffed it too hard ? " Sylvia said , holding the sample toward him . He felt it . " It 's a little too hard , " he said expertly , and then they laughed at each other . He dropped a kiss on her hair . It was too perfect , too sweet to be working like this together , and he thought : I ant really an old-fashioned guy , I am trying to revive a way of life that is gone . Sylvia went to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed her there . They were kissing , leaning against the old tin sink . " Dear , what are we waiting for ? " he begged . Nearly five years they had been sweethearts . " I suppose we 'd better get married , " he said , defeated . " I do n't know , " she said . " How would it change things ? " That was it . This silly Doll 's House , the N ' hole crazy idea of trying to make a living this way . It was nothing to marry on . " Listen , Syl , I could get a drafting job , with an architect , and we could get married . " " I do n't want you to do something you do n't want to do , just to get married . "   But what was he doing now , with these dolls ? Oh , it was just a crazy system , but if he could once get a start , and be financially independent , they 'd be all right . " How much do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling sad , lost . " I do n't know . " She too was sad , perplexed ; not happy the way girls were supposed to be when for the first time they actually discussed the means of marriage with the loved one . " Think we could do it on fifty a week ? " " Why , I guess so , " she said . They both seemed so defeated . It was such an awful place for their love to stop . It would never go beyond this . They were still tender toward each other , brushing against each other , kissing , while she made French pancakes . Sylvia sat across the table , watching Joe cat . She was n't hungry any more . " This is how it would be , " both thought , " married . " ARTS AND SCIENCESA little chain of laboratory incidents , of the sort that sometimes lead to discovery , happened to Mitch Wilner . While injecting his rabbit , in Bacty , he became aware of Beautiful standing behind him , being helpless . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wiry they ever let such Dumb Doras into the medical courses was ' beyond him . Tromping around on their spiked heels , squealing daintily when a rabbit messed their tables , stopping their work to watch the cunning play of a couple of guinea pigs they were supposed to be injecting . " Oh , I do n't see how you ever find those veins so cleverly , " she gurgled as Mitch handed her his syringe . Mitch watched the girl jabbing at the car of her rabbit . Finally , disgusted , he took the syringe . She had practicallyP373ruined the vein , but , going down lower , he found a possible entrance . He had scarcely emptied the syringe when the rabbit 's head began to jerk . Then it made a circular motion , exactly like that of a drunkard . Puzzled , Mitch lifted the animal out of the box . It wobbledon the table . " Tish tish . He 's pie-eyed , " Beautiful remarked . " I bet you had gin in your syringe . " The eyes of the rabbit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steps ; small whistling sounds came as it struggled to breathe . " Say , is this your regular rabbit ? " Mitch demanded of the girl . He looked for the number clip on the ear . There was none . " Oh , I left that off , " Beautiful said . " I do n't think it 's necessary to stick holes in their ears , to identify them . He has a little yellow spot . . . why , say , this is n't Squeaky at all ! It 's another rabbit ! " " Know what 's the matter with him ? " Curly Seabury said , approaching . " Is this anaphylaxis ? " Mitch ventured . " Yeah . Ever see it before ? " " No . " Professor Titus stood behind them , fussing , frowning . " Where did you get that rabbit ? " he snapped . " That rabbitis in use . He was injected last week . Where did you  --  ? " Beautiful had taken him out of the wrong cage ; it was her partner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their animals . The rabbit slowly settled to the tattle . " Awl " moaned Beautiful . " He 's dead . " " Dames ! " Mitch said to Art Weintraub . Professor Titus clicked his tongue , and walked away . Mitch went after him . " Could I open hint up ? " he requested .   The prof gave him an abrupt glance , as if uncertain whether he could even trust his favorite pupil . Then he shrugged . " Go on , do as you please . " After class , Mitch spread the rabbit , and made a long ventral slit , opening the fur . He had not yet got over , and thought he never would lose , the moment of excitement when the inside of a creature was disclosed . There , compactly arrangedwithin the sheet of transparent tissue , lay all the organs , bright and alive as a holiday basket of fruit . Instantly , Mitch saw how the rabbit had died . The lungs were expanded enormously , filling every cranny of the pleural cavity . Evidently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been unable to expel his breath . " So that was the gasping ! " Larry Gans said . " Sure . Anaphylaxis , " Curly repeated . " I do n't understand it , " Mitch murmured . Gans , with the eagerness of a dumbbell for once explainingsomething to a superior student , began : " Well , he had a dose of horse serum last week . So he developed a sensitivity to horse serum . When he gets this second shot of horse serum , he gets an anaphylactic shock . " " Yah ! " cried Mitch impatiently . " And two and two is four . " " Well , what else dya wanta know ? " Ganzy groused . " I do n't understand it , " Mitch repeated to himself . " You do n't understand it ! " Curly Seabury snickered . " Say , even Einstein ca n't tell you why two and two makes four . " But why should the same stuff which an animal readily absorbed one week kill him the following week ? Suppose a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He would become sensitized to horse serum . Suppose , later , he were given tetanus antitoxin , also prepared in horse serum . He would get this shock . And that which man had prepared to cure , might kill !   " It do n't affect humans that way , " Gans said . " Why not ? " " Well , you do n't hear of anybody dying from it . " " Do y ' think they 're going to broadcast it ? " Curly Seabury'sfather was a doctor . For one thing , Mitch reasoned , the principal antitoxins used on humans are prepared in different animals . Sheep 's blood , chickens , cows . And you only got the serum shock if you repeated with blood from the same kind of animal . " There have been a few cases , " Curly said . " Of course it does n't amount to anything , compared to the number of people saved by serums . " Professor Nyquist leaned back in his swivel chair . His face glowed brick-red , angry at man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Wilner . Anaphylaxis is one uff those baffling and apparently contradictory phenomena that man has run into , as a result uff sticking his nose in things . Sometimes I believe that nature is perverse , and every time we think we find something out , she puts one uff these peculiar stumbling blocks in our way , she sticks out her tongue in our face . Just when we think we know how to fool her with immune serums , we have this anaphylactic shock . " " Well , is it a reaction in the blood ? " Mitch asked . " You mean , does the anaphylactic reaction take place in the bloodstream ? " " Yes . " " Suppose you answer this for yourself . " Mitch thought back . The cause of death had been the freezing of the smooth muscles . In the cells of the muscles , then ? In the involuntary nervous system ? " Some very fine work has been done on this point , " said Professor Nyquist . " Look . You take a dog which is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a
