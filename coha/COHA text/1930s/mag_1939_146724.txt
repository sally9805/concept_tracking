SOARING WINGS-George Palmer Putnam-Harcourt , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> Lanky , tousle-mopped Amelia Earhart , whom the Pacific swallowed two years ago , flew the Atlantic twice : in 1928 with a pilot ( she never touched the controls ) ; in 1932 solo . Soaring Wings , a family memoir by her publicity-loving husband , George Palmer Putnam , is full of scrappy , discursive trivia ( Flier Earhart kept bowls of little yellow tomatoes around the house to eat at random , slept three nights in a new flying coat to get it suitably wrinkled ) but does manage to tell how this four-year air change came about . <P> Aviator Earhart was still relatively unskilled in flying when she became famous as an airwoman . Commercial flights and publicity ventures gave her experience , helped pay for the longer hops she took for the fun of it . She never quite broke even , though her extracurricular activities ranged from being a peripatetic faculty member of Purdue , to designing women 's shirts with tails ample enough to let their wearers stand decently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not remember introducing her even once as Mrs. Putnam " ) she was still feminine ( her thought going through a thunderstorm over the Gulf of Mexico : " How pretty my ship must look against such a background-and there is nobody here to see it . " ) . <P> A nonsmoker , Flier Earhart endorsed Lucky Strikes to get the $1,500 she wanted to give the first Byrd Antarctic expedition . She liked meeting fellow celebrities . The Prince of Wales agreed with her that fliers made good dancers , after which they spent an evening together proving it . But when Amelia Earhart 's plane disappeared in the Pacific she was doing the thing she liked best .
