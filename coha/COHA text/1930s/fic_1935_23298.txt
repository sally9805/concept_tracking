VULNERABLE A STORY BY SUSAN ERTZ MHE Pemborough Post Office and I general shop were in a small one-storied cottage adjoining the little two-storied cottage in which Mrs. Lupton and her two nieces , Beryl and Gracie Fuller , lived . The two girls shared a bedroom next to their aunt 's room , and below were a living room and a kitchen . From any part of the cottage the light tinkle of the opening shop door could easily be heard , or the far more frequent shrilling of the telephone , which , with its switchboard , was in the passageway , and readily accessible from dwelling or shop . One or another of the three women could be heard answering it at frequent intervals during the day and often late into the night . " Hell &; Hello ! Colfant 21 ? Hold on , please . You 're through . " " Hello ! Hello ! Telegram for Mrs. Broom ? Righto . I 'll take it down . " " Hello ! Hello ! Bell 's Fruit Salts ? Yes , we 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy will call I 'll have it ready . " Pemborough was on the quiet road between Colfant and Orton . Though the last two were hardly more than villages , Pemborough was smaller than either , and its tiny population was scattered over a fairly wide area . Mrs. Lupton was a cautious , dependable woman with an almost prophetic insight into the require.ments of her neighbors . When she handled the bottles of Marmite , the lung tonic , the sugar candy , the dog biscuits , the cigarettes , and all the hundred and one articles of village trade she thought of them as Beryl 's trousseau , Gracie 's winter coat , the comfortable armchair she had for so long been wanting . She was a widow and , though kindly and capable , was limited in imagination and interests . She had taken her two motherless nieces to live with her when their father , her only brother , went to Tasmania , from which far place he decided never to return . Although she was genuinely fond of them , she made no attempt to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ natures or to modify them in any way . She noticed that Beryl was adventurous like her father  --  though happily with a stronger sense of duty , and that Gracie was timid like her mother ; but so long as they behaved themselves and were " good " girls she did not concern herself further . Beryl was big and fair , with a ready Laugh and an easy , bantering way with admirers . She was on friendlier terms with a man in ten minutes than Gracie would be in as many months . She feared only one thing in the world , and that was spinsterhood , and was now , at twenty-five , engaged to a young electrical engineer in Orton . Gracie was a year and a half older , and resembled her sister in nothing . She was thin , small-boned , dark , excitable , nervous and , above all , excessively feminine in that she had none of the stabilizing , sturdier characteristics usually associated with the male . She brooded over her own physical states . Her body and its workings were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by a single ray of candor or of knowledge . She shrank from Beryl 's occasional outbursts of boisterous frankness , shocked and affronted , so that Beryl learned to keep her jokes and her lively humors for her friends . She looked at men  --  who were inclined to dislike or ignore her  --  with troubled , indirect , apprehensive glances . She never forgot for an instant that they were men , and when they were about , thought of herself as darkly present to their thoughts as they were darkly present to hers . Her eyes were large and brown , the whites not very clear . Though discontented , she clung to the things and the ways she knew , and whatever it was that she secretly desired for herself , had neither the wit nor the courage to obtain it . For the greater part of the time she was as frightened as a bird under a strawberry net , and any approach from a stranger or a male acquaintance caused panic fiutterings . It was Beryl who delivered the letters after dark , tramping down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheerful and unafraid . Such was Gracie 's mistrust of the world that she would only go the rounds in the mornings when people were busy about their work , when delivery vans rattled briskly up and down the lanes , children hurried to school , and housewives beat carpets and hung washing on the line . Even then she approached front doors with reluctance , and her knock , that double rat-tat , had no confidence in it . And under nocircumstances would she be left in the Post Office by herself . Sometimes when Beryl and her aunt were with her , and she felt safe and protected , she would throw a furtively provocative look at a man ; but should he try to follow this up he would at once drive her into one of her panic flutters , her whole being in scared retreat and revolt . She longed for some charm or weapon that would make her as strong as the strongest . She would have liked a lethal booby trap at the shop door , so that if ever a menacing stranger appeared there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would have liked to keep a loaded pistol under the counter and under her pillow , but knew she would be too frightened of the thing herself . She often wished for a great , savage , devoted dog which would be ready at a word from her to spring at the throat of anyone who might try to molest her . Timidity was the main , the central trait in her character , and it dominated all her thoughts and actions . One day in November the road below Pemborough was under repair and closed to all vehicles , the traffic being diverted through Briding to the Colfant-Orton roads beyond . Only the mail carriers on their motor cycles could approach the Post Office and people on bicycles or on foot . The swift crescendo and de-crescendo of passing cars ceased ; no horns sounded ; a silence fell on the place that seemed to Gracie brooding and sinister . Cut off from the stream of busy , everyday life , her fears increased tenfold and gave her no peace . Her own weakness , her own vulnerability seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constitute an invitation to it . At night no friendly headlights wavered briefly across her ceiling , no longer was she comforted by the brusque sound of horns . The owls had the darkness to themselves and never before , it seemed to her , had so many of them gathered spectrally about the house , calling to one another evilly from tree to tree . She envied passionately all those fortunate people who lived in towns where lights persisted in friendly fashion until the day . Evbn Beryl 's regular breathing beside her failed to reassure her or the light , occasional snores of her aunt in the next room . Only those two women between her and all the dangers that threatened her . It was no security at all . " You 'll go balmy if you keep worrying about yourself the whole time , " said Beryl one night , knowing that a faint creak from below was keeping her sister rigid with terror under the bedclothes . There came a Saturday , while the road was still under repair , when Mrs. Lupton went to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as she returned , Beryl was to catch the five o'clock bus and go to Orton to meet her fianeL the electrical engineer . It was a raw and misty evening and dark at four , and though it was not raining , the roof , the hedges , the branches of the trees were all dripping ; not with the honest , steady drip of raindrops , but with the whispering , furtive drip of water slowly condensing . Before the daylight faded the girls could barely see the low fence in front of the shop . When the lights were lit they were reflected blankly back again by the gathering fog . " It 'll take three-quarters of an hour to get to Orton to-night , " said Beryl , unfastening her work-apron . " The bus 'll probably be late too , but I dare n't count on it . I got left that way last time there was a fog . " " Perhaps Aunt Bessie 'll be late too , " said Gracie , frightened . " You ca n't go off and leave me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 4.15 from Colfant it 'll be all right , " said Beryl . " She 'll be back about the time I ought to start . " " Well , you ca n't go and leave me alone , " Grade insisted , her voice shrill with anxiety . " Now , now , do n't begin getting the wind up , silly ! What if you are alone for a few minutes ? Who 's going to eat you ? " " I wo n't stay here ! " cried Gracie . " I wo n't stay . I 'll come with you . I wo n't stay here alone . " " Leave the place empty ? How can you think of such a thing ? " But that was a consideration that meant nothing to Gracie in comparison to her own safety , and she said so with vehemence . Beryl saw , with wonder and an affectionate contempt , her tense , frightened face , her nervous fluttering hands , her scared , open mouth . " Oh , all right , all right , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets back . But if I miss the bus Fred 'll have something to say , I can tell you . " She got ready and kept craning her blond head out of the door to see if Mrs. Lupton were near at hand . There was no knowing which way she would come . She might get off at Three Oaks Corner , in Briding , and walk down the lane , or stay on the bus as far as The Green Man and walk back by the footpath . Beryl preferred going by way of The Green Man and waiting there , where she was almost sure to find someone she knew to chat with . Gracie remonstrated with her for keeping the door open , so she went outside and stood with her back against the glass , while Gracie bent , shivering , over the stove . Suddenly Beryl opened the door and shouted in : " Hooray ! Here she comes . She 's walked down from Three Oaks Corner . Good-by ! I 'm off . " And Gracie heard her call out , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miss my bus if I do n't run . " Much relieved , Gracie was about to open the door for her aunt when the telephone rang . She went to the switchboard . " Yes , Pemborough . Hello . Who is it ? A message from Mrs. Lupton ? But she 's here . She 's coming in at the door now . Wait a second . " She ran back into the shop as the door-bell tinkled and there stood a Mrs. Reed , a small woman about the size and shape of her Aunt Bessie . She was smiling and wiping the moisture from her face . " Beryl mistook me for your aunt , " she said . " It 's the first time anyone ever did that , but it 's terrible dark and foggy out . I called out to her that it was Mrs. Reed but she did n't stop to listen . " With a scared look and without speaking , Gracie hurried back to the telephone . " It was n't Mrs. Lupton , " she said . " What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't another one till six fifteen ! " She hung up the telephone and came back into the shop , her eyes staring and frightened . " I 'm all alone , " she said to Mrs. Reed excitedly . " Beryl and Aunt Bessie are both out . Aunt Bessie wo n't be back for two hours , and I 'll be all alone in the shop . " " Well , I wo n't trouble you much , my dear , " said Mrs. Reed , fumbling for her purse . " I just want to buy some liniment for Benny 's chest . He 's bad to-night and worries me to death with his coughing . " " But I ca n't stay here alone ! " said Gracie . " It is n't right for me to be alone in the shop . Anything might happen . " " I 'd stay with you for a bit , " said Mrs. Reed kindly , " only I ca n't leave Benny . He 's got a temperature andhe 's that restless I do n't know what to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while I was out . Maybe she 'd come and sit with you for a bit . " " You must make her come . You do n't know how frightened I am in the shop alone . Make her come . " She looked so like a hunted , fright . ened hare that Mrs. Reed was sorry for her . " I 'll send her along if she 'll come , " she said . " She 's got old Grandfather Stobart on her hands with his bad legs . He ca n't do a thing for himself , poor old man . " " It is n't right for me to be here alone , " Gracie insisted . " She must come . " Mrs. Reed paid for the liniment . " I ca n't promise anything , " she said , " but I 'll see what I can do . You 've always got the telephone handy , " she reminded her . " What 's the good of the telephone ? By the time someone got here I might be dead . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Mrs. Reed , looking at her with mixed sympathy and curiosity . " Maybe if you was married and had a family you 'd take things a bit easier . Anyway a telephone must be company , I always think . " At that moment it rang again and Gracie went to it and took down a telegram for Doctor Tomlin . While she was telephoning it to its destination , Mrs. Reed slipped out , so that when Grade came back she saw that the thing she had for so long dreaded and feared was at hand . She was alone in the shop . She stood by the stove , staring at the front door . It would take Mrs. Reed nearly ten minutes to walk home , and Mrs. Stobart , if she came at all , another ten to reach the Post Office . She rubbed her cold fingers and listened , and there was nothing to be heard but the humming of the oil stove and , out-side , the faint sound of the moisture dripping sibilantly and secretly from the trees about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Ever since leaving school she had known it was bound to happen to her some day . And nobody cared . Nobody cared if she were murdered or not ; they had n't taken the trouble to see that she was protected in any way . They 'd just callously left her to her fate . She began to shake and tears rushed into her eyes . She prayed as a child prays , " Oh , God , please do n't let anything happen to me . Please do n't let anything happen to me . " Aunt Bessie had often told her that she ought to trust in God , and she 'd tried ; but old Mrs. Treadwell at Silmer had trusted in God and gone regularly to church , and she 'd been murdered by her own nephew for the money in her mattress . And then people said , " The ways of the Lord are past finding out . " That 's what they 'd say if she were found murdered in the Post Office . And that would be the end , before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ experienced the things other , luckier girls experienced . She thought of calling up the Police Station in Orton but was afraid of what P. C. Wardle would say to her if he came on his bicycle and found nothing wrong . Still , she thought , she might say that there was a man , a suspicious-looking character , hanging about the Post Office , and that she was all alone and ought to have some sort of protection . It would give P. C. Wardle something to do . And when he got there she could say that the man had been frightened away and would describe him . " Poor girl , " people would say when they heard of it . " She ought n't to he left all alone like that in the Post Office . It 's a shame . " She went to the telephone and stood irresolutely in front of it . It wasdaring . It would be the most daring thing she had ever done . But , oh , the relief , to know that P. C. Wardle was on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helmet and his masculine voice and all that he stood for ! Before her timidity could paralyze her , before she could be caught , helpless , between two fears , she succumbed to the greater and rang up the Police Station . P. C. Wardle himself answered . Could he come at once on his bicycle , she asked ? There was a suspicious-looking man hanging about the Post Office and peering in . She was all alone there , and she was frightened about the money . The man was a stranger and she did n't like the look of him . P. C. Wardle said that he 'd come at once and meanwhile if she were nervous she 'd better lock the door . Just as she hung up the telephone she heard the door-bell tinkle and footsteps in the shop . Too late to lock it now . Someone was already inside . Praying that it might be a neighbor , she went to look , and her heart leaped with fear when she saw a man she had never seen before , a dark man with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled down over one eye . A red cotton handkerchief was knotted about his neck and his clothes were muddy . Not only had the moment she had dreaded come , but the man as well . She tried to hide her fear and looked at him without speaking . " Nasty foggy evening , Miss , " he said . She ignored this opening . " What do you want ? " she asked . He had the end of a cigarette in his mouth , and before replying he went to the door , opened it a few inches , tossed it out , and closed the door again . If only she could have shut it on him then , she thought ! But he gave her no chance . He moved toward the counter and she slipped behind it . Putting his hand into his pocket , slowly and with deliberation he drew out some change . " What is it you want ? " she asked again , more sharply . ' Easy , Miss , easy . Ninepence , ten-pence ha'penny , one and tenpence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Eh ? " " What do you want ? " she demanded , for the third time . " What 's your hurry , Miss ? " What 's your hurry ? Ca n't a chap stop to think a bit ? " He looked up and eyed her in a puzzled fashion from under his cap . Then he pushed it on one side and scratched his head . Once more he examined the money in his hand . " Sixpence and fivepence makes elevenpence , " he said . " And eleven-pence from one and tenpence ha'penny leaves elevenpence ha'penny . Whereas , sixpence and twopence ha'penny from one and tenpence ha'penny leaves . . . what would you say it leaves , Miss ? Leaves a man hungry , do n't it ? Leaves a man without a bed . " " Will you please say what it is you want ? " she asked in a high , strained voice . " I ca n't stand here all night waiting for you . I 'm in a hurry . " Oh , to get him out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tolerant amiability . " In a hurry , are you , Miss ? Well , that 's where we 're different . Now , I could stay here all night , here by this stove . No offense meant , Miss . Nice warm place , that 's all . See ? That 's how it strikes me on a nasty , cold , wet night . Got a roof over your head and a warm place to sleep in , ai n't you , Miss ? You 're lucky , you are . Well now , let me see . About this purchase I 'm a-going to make . " She could hardly keep from screaming . As he looked about the shop she put a hand over her mouth and her eyes were staring . How to get rid of him ? How to get rid of him ? Suddenly he leaned over the counter , looking at the shelves just behind her . She backed away as far as she could go . " You tell me what you want or I 'll call my aunt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll make you say what you want quick enough . " He booked reproachfully at her out of a pair of dark , troubled eyes which , however , had a spark of amusement in them . " Oh , Miss , you would n't call your aunt , would you ? Oh , Miss , not your aunt ! Well , if that ai n't just my luck ! Just as I was getting a bit warm in here you want to go and call your aunt . Well , if you wo n't let a chap think and warm himself up a bit , you wo n't , I dare say . Lor , you got a heart like a coconut , Miss . You know , got the milk of human kindness inside it all right , but what 's the good if you ca n't get at it ? It 's a terrible thing to have a heart like that , Miss . You take my word it is . " He was crafty . He was thinking out what he had better do . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , as she had said , her aunt was in the next room . " If you do n't want anything , " she said , tense and trembling , " just you get out . Do you hear me ? Just you get out . " " Well , who said I did n't want anything ? Eh ? What 's this money for that I 've got here ? Eh , Miss ? I 'll tell you what I want then as you 're in such a hurry . I 'll have a sixpennyworth of Sailors ' Cut and a bar of nut chocolate for twopence ha'penny . There you are now . What 's wrong with that ? " There was a large box on the counter with different kinds of cigarettes and pipe tobacco in it . She selected a small packet of Sailors ' Cut and handed it to him , receiving his sixpence and taking care not to touch his hand . But the chocolate was behind her on a shelf , and not for anything in the world would she have turned her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was sure . He wanted her to turn round , and then his hands would be at her throat . He would drag her backward over the counter and strangle her . " The chocolate is n't here , " she said , breathing quickly . " It is n't here , I tell you . I 'll show you where to get it . It is n't here . " He saw her rolling , frightened eyes and stared at her with droll surprise . " Lor , Miss . What 's the matter ? Ca n't a chap come into a Post Office and warm himself a bit and ask for a bar of chocolate without a person getting excited about it ? " " I tell you the chocolate is n't here , It 's over there , in that cupboard . I ca n't reach it . You 'll have to get it yourself . You reach up and get it . " " All right , Miss . All right . You 've only got to mention it , like . I 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He moved toward the cupboard and she followed him . " Up there , " she said , pointing . " Right up on the top shelf , as far as you can reach . " " All right , Miss . I 'll get it . " It was a fairly deep cupboard , deep enough and high enough for a tall man to stand upright in . He went inside and reached up , as he was asked to do , and felt about on the top shelf for a packet that was n't there . She slammed the door on him and turned the key . Then with one hand clutched against her side , she leaned , almost ready to faint , against the counter and steadied herself . " Here , here ! " cried the man inside , knocking and banging . " Here , Miss , Miss ! Is this a joke ? Let me out of this . Miss ! Miss ! " Her terror of him , from the first moment he came in , had been extreme , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cupboard it increased ahundredfold . A horror , a kind of frenzy , was added to her fear . It was the same as when big spiders got into her room at night , as they sometimes did in the summer . She did n't know for certain whether they would bite her or not but she feared them and struck at them with her shoe . And if she wounded one and saw it running wildly , maimed , her horror of it increased . Then she would strike and strike again until it bore no resemblance to a living thing and no longer reproached her with its broken body . Now she felt something of this extreme horror toward the man in the cupboard . She had to make herself safe from him , and from his fury at what she had done to him . She had to still that urgent , insistent voice , with its " Miss ! Miss ! What 's the idea ? Let me out ! Miss ! " She looked wildly about her , searching for some idea to seize upon . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metal to keep the heat from the floor . She lifted this up and laid it down close to the door of the cupboard . There was a crack under this door about an inch wide , and she saw how it might help her to make herself safe from him till P. C. Wardle came . She took a candle and lighted it and put it down on the metal sheet . Then she brought from under the counter a box full of paper and old rags . These she lighted , tearing the paper into pieces and twisting them and pushing them just under the door , not far enough for him to be able to stamp on them , but far enough so that the smoke went curling up inside the cupboard . The metal sheet kept the floor from catching fire . She knelt there , like a priestess before an altar , while the banging and shouting of the man inside grew more and more violent . " Miss ! Miss ! What in hell are you doing out there ? What 's the idea ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me out ? Are you crazy ? I 'll suffocate in here . Let me out ! " He began to choke . She went on with her burning , redoubling her efforts . If he should get out now ! He kicked the door , he beat on it ; but there was not room enough for him to throw his weight against it , and his efforts were ineffectual . Presently , after a fit of choking , he tried to be jocular , which added to her horror of him and made her work yet faster . " Miss ! I give in ! I 'll marry you to-morrow . Miss ! Let me out and we 'll get married to-morrow . Miss ! " A fit of choking once more quieted him for a while . Then he began again , " Miss ! I 'll make you a good husband . I swear I will . " He coughed again , and as soon as he could speak began to plead with her in a different way . " Miss , I 've got a young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got . It 's the truth , Miss . I 'm all he 's got in the world . Stop it , Miss . A joke 's a joke . Let me out . " Her horror increased . As his choking grew worse , the faster she worked , the more bits of burning cloth and paper she pushed under the crack . It was as though she were killing a mad dog who yet looked at her from time to time with friendly , pleading eyes . The smoke made her choke too , and she ran to a window and opened it and saw that the draft drew the smoke still more thickly under the crack of the door . He began tearing at the shelves in the cupboard . One came down with a crash and with it medicine bottles , cough mixtures , liniments , and tonics . There was a great crashing and tinkling of glass . Then he pulled down a second shelf , and used it as a weapon for battering down the door . Now that be had more space to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave a little and the lock be-gan to loosen . He was choking and cursing and gasping , and when he could get breath enough , telling her what he would do to her if he got out . She began praying , " Oh , God , let someone come in time . 011 , God , let them come in time ! " Suddenly the banging ceased and she could hear little movements inside the cupboard . He was dipping his handkerchief in some of the fluid that was now beginning to run out under the door , and she guessed that he was tying it over his nose and mouth , for when he coughed again it was with a muffled sound , and his attack on the door strengthened . Her terror was such that she could barely control the trembling of her hands . The paper in the candle-flame shook and wavered . He was going to get out ! In a moment the lock would give , and she would be helpless and defenseless in his hands . At her wits ' end she ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He rammed at the lock again and again ; it gave suddenly and the door burst outward . As the table crashed over she shrieked and ran to the shop door and , flinging it open , rushed out into the fog screaming " Help ! Help ! " her prisoner close behind her . He was a terrible sight , with his red handkerchief over his face , his eyes wild and streaming , and blood from his cut hands smeared on his face and clothing . Fleet though she was , he was fleeter . He caught her just inside the gate , and as she felt his hands upon her she went limp , opening her arms to him and crying out imploring words . She tried to hold him , tried to seize his hands in hers . There was no struggle ; she seemed to have no fight in her . It was as though she were offering herself to him to do with what he would . He struck her once , hard , on her upraised chin , and as she reeled , caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doorway of the shop . For one second he hesitated , then he turned , vaulted the gate , and disappeared into the night . P. C. Wardle reached the Post Office ten minutes later He was much puzzled . In fact the thing was beyond his unravelling , and he telephoned to Colfant for the Inspector . If the assailant had come to rob the Post Office , how had Gracie got hint into the cupboard , and how was it that nothing had been taken ? Even after Doctor Tomlin had been and gone , and Gracie was sitting up by the stove with her aching , suffering head bandaged , waiting for the Inspector to come , her story seemed to P. C. Wardle a funny , muddled business . A murderer and robber would n't be likely , it seemed to him , to go into a cupboard to oblige a lady and hunt for chocolates . Chocolates ! But when they caught him they 'd know a bit more . The police all over the county had been warned , and it was n't likely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ description of him carefully . " A small , fair man with a fair mustache and blue eyes , wearing a light overcoat and a soft hat . The third finger of his right hand missing and a mole or wen on one cheek . " " Lucky thing you had a good look at him , " P. C. Wardle said , snapping the rubber band round his notebook .
