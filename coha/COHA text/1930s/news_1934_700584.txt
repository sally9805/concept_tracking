txt " The Fleet 's In , " a picture representing uniformed sailors on shore liberty and painted by Paul Cadmus , New York CWA artist , was removed from the Navy Department today at the insistence of Secretary Swanson . Colonel Henry L. Roosevelt , Assistant Secretary , sent the painting to his home after Admiral Hugh Rodman , retired , former commander-in-chief of the fleet , complained of it as an " insult to the enlisted men of the American Navy . " In a letter to Secretary Swanson , Admiral Rodman , who commanded the American battleship force in British waters during the World War , declared that the scene depicted originated in the " imagination of some one who has no conception of actual conditions in our service . " " It represents a most disgraceful , sordid , disreputable , drunken brawl , wherein apparently a number of enlisted men are consorting with a party of streetwalkers and denizens of the red-light district , " the admiral wrote . Part of CWA Exhibit . The Cadmus painting had never been publicly displayed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America 's CWA art in a thirty-day exhibition opening at the Corcoran Gallery of Art next Tuesday . The works in the exhibition are supposed to be the best produced by government-hired artists . Each regional director chose from his field what he regarded as the best examples done there and forwarded them . Edward Bruce , secretary of the advisory committee on fine arts in the Treasury Department ; Forbes Watson and Edward Rowan acted as a jury here to select the works for the show . After the Rodman protest was received Secretary Swanson communicated with the Treasury Department and the picture was turned over to him for inspection . He does not . intend to allow its exhibition , but would not say further what the navy intended to do with the painting . He added that the picture showed " all the derelictions of the navy and none of its virtues , " and while " right artistic " was " not true to the navy . " Admiral Rodman 's letter read as follows : Washington , D. C. , April 6 , 1934 . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Washington Evening Star , under the caption " CWA Art to Be Exhibited Here , " there is an illustration purporting to represent a characteristic scene of a liberty party on shore from the fleet by Paul Cadmus , a New York artist . It represents a most disgraceful , sordid , disreputable , drunken brawl , wherein apparently a number of enlisted men are consorting with a party of streetwalkers and denizens of the red-light district . This is an unwarranted insult to the enlisted personnel of ' our navy , is utterly without foundation in fact , and evidently originated in the . sordid , depraved imagination of some one who has kno conception of actual conditions in our service . If I were called upon to produce legal evidence that such a scene could not exist I would state , first , that liberty is not a rarity . it is a matter of routine . Officers and men are encouraged to go ' on shore when off duty . That in all cases , in our own , as well as in foreign ports , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men on patrol duty to preserve law and order and who would prevent such a scene should one be attempted and would immediately put an end to it . Such a picture is utterly misleading and gives the public not only an erroneous idea of the behavior of our men but is in fact diametrically opposed to conditions which actually obtain . Let me give a couple of actual examples . During the war I was in command of the battleship force in British waters where , on account of our station in Scapa Flow and other conditions , it was impracticable to grant general liberty for a period of about three months . Then , finding ourselves in Edinburgh . general liberty was granted to some 5.300 enlisted men . This during the Christmas holidays . They were received most hospitably and cordially and were entertained lavishly by the citizens of Edinburgh . There was no restriction upon the . use of intoxicants other than that of the men 's own self-respect . Out of this number , there were but five delinquencies reported ? namely , three who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so later , and two who were reported to be under the influence of liquor . The whole British press was most enthusiastic in its comment and praise of the conduct and bearing of our men on this occasion . Again , when in command of the flagship of the North Atlantic Station , liberty was granted in one of our sea-coast watering places to some 13,000 men . Of this number , there were reported for disorderly conduct on shore seven men , of whom five were found to be guilty . On the ' police blotter of this city of not over 30,000 inhabitants , there were twenty-seven entries of offenses by the citizens on the same day . Can you imagine 13,000 young college men , say , from Yale , Harvard , Columbia . or other institutions , or any body of business men , or any social organization , being on shore for recreation and having such an excellent record ? To return to the Edinburgh incident . It may not be generally known that the ships of the United States Navy are known throughout every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ships . " It is a custom for the enlisted personnel unaided by the commissioned officers , to go into the highways and by-ways at Christmas time and collect the waifs and strays among the children who otherwise would have no Christmas , bring them on board where they find the ship elaborately decorated and prepared for their reception . Here they are entertained at dinner , at children 's games , with Christmas trees , where toys are distributed and w ' ? ere each boy receives a Scout outfit and the girls a set of cheap furs . Not mowing that we would be abroad at Christmas time when we went to Edinburgh , we had laid in our Christmas supplies on the supposition that we would be in an American port on Christmas . After discussing the situation , the men decided that a child was a child , whether American or Scotch . They asked 125 children to come on board , preferably those who had been orphaned during the war  --  the poorer and more dependent , the better . No Claim That All Are Saints @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , some seven or eight miles , in motor buses . Once aboard , they were entertained . given a good dinner and the usual toys and presents , and in addition each youngster was given two bright silver shillings ? probably the greatest amount of cash any of them had ever possessed at any one time . These examples must be sufficient in themselves to show the spirit that prevails among the men in the American Navy . Let me add that today I know of no finer body of men than our enlisted personnel , both in the navy and Marine Corps . Owing to our policy of enlistment , no one who is not physically , mentally and morally fit would be selected . There are dozens of applications where one is chosen . In this way we get the very best . Our men are self-respecting. self-reliant ; they are trustworthy , well-behaved and , while no one would claim that all are saints . still it is the rare exception to find a man who would stoop to Such a disgraceful orgy as is set forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that out of our enlisted personnel each year 100 of the best qualified are given appointments to the Naval Academy . Others who show special aptitude and fitness are appointed directly into the Marine Corps . I wish to add that while in command of the Pacific Fleet a club was established on shore at San Pedro , Calif. , by the chief petty officers . I was present at its dedication and on several subsequent occasions I and other officers of the fleet in our official capacity attended dances and receptions which were given , at which their wives , mothers and sweethearts were present ; that I never witnessed the slightest unbecoming behavior on the part of any of the men , but on the other hand it was remarked that it was doubtful that at a like social function that might be given in any of our communities would you see better behavior and find as little to criticize . In conclusion , let me add that every enlisted man in the service will justly resent the insult that has been heaped upon them and upon the service @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no foundation in fact and which I trust will not only not be allowed to be hung in the Corcoran Art Gallery or any other , but that it will be immediately destroyed . Sincerely yours , HUGH RODMAN.
