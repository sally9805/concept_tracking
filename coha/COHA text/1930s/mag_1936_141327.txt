Albert Payson Terhune is a big , beefy man who cultivates untidy hair and a vast reputation for knowing and loving dogs . On the subject of Man 's Best Friend , he has written millions of well-paid words . Last week small Editor Morris Fishbein of the American Medical Association 's Journal editorially jumped roundly upon large Mr. Terhune for injudicious talk about rabies . <P> Dogman Terhune had published in the August issue of Reader 's Digest a brief essay entitled " Beware of the Dog " which consisted mainly of advice on how to avoid being bitten . A dog which comes up with high head and loud barks , observed Mr. Terhune , does not intend to bite . If the animal approaches with head down and low growls , it probably means to bite but will frequently be too puzzled to do so if the person stands with feet together and hands on chest . That dogs are inclined to attack people who are afraid of them Author Terhune ascribes to a " fear-smell " arising from increased production of adrenalin in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this odor . <P> With these techniques and theories , Dr. Fishbein had no quarrel . What he did object to was the following advice by Writer Terhune : <P> " If . . . you are bitten by a dog , remember this-not once in many thousand times is the dog rabid . Rabies exists , but it is very rare . Of the almost uncountable bites inflicted during a term of years on attendants in the New York City dog pounds , not one caused a case of rabies . <P> " If the bite is where your lips can reach it , suck it out thoroughly . Then bathe it in lukewarm ( not hot ) water and paint it with iodine . And do n't worry . You are in no danger . If you are afraid the biter had rabies-which he almost never has-use the same treatment but paint the wound with carbolic acid instead of iodine . . . . " <P> Denouncing this attitude as " subversive , " Editor Fishbein declared that dog bites are not matters for self-treatment but for physicians and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rarity of hydrophobia , he gave these data : <P> 1 ) Of 1,922 dogs ' heads sent to Ohio laboratories for examination in two months , 416 revealed rabies infection . <P> 2 ) Of 423 persons bitten by mad dogs in England in one year , 148 contracted rabies and died . Mortality : 35% . <P> " The least that can be done , " said Dr. Fishbein , " is to cauterize the wound and place the biter under observation in the city pound or a dog hospital . If he develops the disease , begin the Pasteur treatment at once if it has not already been started . ... In 99 out of every 100 cases treated , Pasteur treatment protects against a disease that is always fatal once it develops . <P> " The first Pasteur treatment was given almost 50 years ago . . . . The failure of victims to avail themselves of this formidable weapon . . . can be attributed largely to ignorance , carelessness , indifference and the widespread dissemination of such advice as that found in Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
