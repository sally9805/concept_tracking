txt A huge Federal public works and housing plan as part of the contemplated social program to be put before Congress was advocated today by Mayor LaGuardia , who spoke before the advisory council of the Committee on Economic Security . Most American dies , including New York , had " absorbed " as many loans as could be floated , he declared , adding that any such a building program as suggested would have to be Federally financed . The New York Executive declared that private industry had shown " neither courage nor good sense " before 1929 and that it would have to put up with such a public program . now " for a year or a year and a half . " He added that his " drastic and far-reaching " program should be based not upon an assumption that there would be recovery but upon immediate needs . Mayor LaGuardia said such a plan would be sharply fought " by constitutional lawyers , economists and others , " and suggested that President Roosevelt ask all Governors to call special sessions of their Legislatures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1 , for instance , " so that any necessary amendments to their Constitutions could be approved immediately . New " Normal Level " Seen . " I have noted repeated mention of the possibility of a return to prosperity in dealing with the relief problem , " the Mayor said in advocating permanent social legislation to meet present needs . " If we return to what was normal in 1929 , well and good . Nothing we do could harm things then . But as I see it , we must take the position we have reached a new normal level , and provide for it . " After we 've drafted a legislative program we 'll have all the States ' rights advocates , constitutional lawyers and economists'saying that we ca n't execute it . " There will be those who will say , ' Let private industry do it . We begged private industry to do it before 1929 , and it had neither the courage nor the good sense . " We have 12,000,000 jobless to thank these people for . " Additional loans to municipalities will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Works loans now approved for New York . I have $50,000,000 more coining . You ca n't have relief on a 4 per cent interest basis , and that is what we are paying . " We 've given government aid to shipping and to many other Indus*les that you will hear of when final facts are known . " Outlining his program , which he called a practical relief system to take the load off municipalities , the Mayor said : " First , we can have so-called selfliquidating projects . Then we can have a great housing program , the object of which would be to furnish sanitary , safe , low-cost dwellings . We must offset high-land values in our cities and can not possibly do so if we have to pay high interest rates . " There are many other necessary public works that can be undertaken . Street crossings can be improved . Transportation improvements are necessary , power plants can be constructed . All these things will employ a good many of the jobless . " I repeat that the municipalities can not absorb more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't pile up any more debts or the thing will topple over . " Turning again to the difficulties of putting into effect " a drastic social program , " Mayor LaGuardia said by way of warning : " We are going to be met by opposition , legal and otherwise , to any-1 thing we shall do . There are those who want to get labor cheaply on a competitive basis . Wide Drive Is Urged . " There is one appeal I want to make . That is that after a program is agreed on and legislation drafted , we marshal our strength in getting the legislation passed . " I should suggest to President Roosevelt that he ask the Governors of all the States to have their Legislatures in session on a certain date so that any constitutional amendments can be adopted and this whining stopped . " I wish industry would get this straight . It complains about relief that we are handing out . It is relief not only for the recipient but for all business . The money goes out into circulation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returns of industry . " The program I advocate would mean the expenditure of millions and millions of dollars . I say that without blushing . Do n't forget that the remdy for this crisis must be drastic . "
