S. chemists apologized for having laughed at people who predict the weather by feelings in their feet . They awarded the William H. Nichols Medal of the American Chemical Society to Dr. John Arthur Wilson , 40 , consulting chemist of Milwaukee . Wis . Dr. Wilson was judged worthy of the medal ( given for outstanding achievement in colloid chemistry ) for his seven years ' study of leather . He had found that the dimensions of leather are affected by changes in relative humidity , that shoes swell , pinching tender feet , when wet weather approaches . By using special tanning materials , he proved to shoe manufacturers that this foot-squeeze can be reduced two-thirds . He also demonstrated to shoemen that by proper tanning they could make a shoe waterproof from the outside , at the same time allow perspiration to evaporate from the inside 80% as fast as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resilience , porosity , density of leather , he organized Properties &; Uses of Leather , a national committee to study the foot comfort of U.
