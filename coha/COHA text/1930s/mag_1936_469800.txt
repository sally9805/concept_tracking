MHE sky was gray , a yellowish-gray , the I sea turbid , and misty-gray the air . In the distance a dark gray streak on the horizon . Land , Sumatra 's east coast with its vaporous forests . There was a terrible , oppressive heat , although it was still early morning . A quarter to six . And we were perspiring already . My hair was disheveled and sticking to my temples , and little rills of sweat were running down my back . The Prinz Ludwig lay quite still , the gentle little waves splashing and spurting against her huge hull . The passengers were asleep ; only we five who had to land at Sumatra stood at the rail , waiting for the small coasting vessel that was to take us ashore . Large , deep-drawing ocean liners are not able to get close to the east coast of Sumatra which , a thousand odd kilometers long , is a swamp from one end to the other . The terrible tropical rains wash the mud from the mountains , and the ocean , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muddy , shallow mush . On the bridge , the sleepy officer on duty was walking up and down at regular intervals . In the dining room the staff , silent and ill-tempered , was busy with brooms and dusters . There was an unmistakable early-morning atmosphere . Suddenly on the eastern horizon , a large , - orange-yellow disk emerged . Red rays darted into the lilac-gray mist . The mast , the cables , the still smoking funnel , the gray iron rails , the handful of sleepy sailorslolling about the deck , and the officer walking back and forth on the bridge , grew orange-yellow . Blood and orange-tinted was the sea , rosy the mist , dark-lilac the streak on the distant horizon . Hungry sea gulls wheeled screaming around the ship and fell upon the contents of a rinsing-pail which was being emptied into the sea . Life on board began to stir , Here and there a drowsy passenger , an early riser in pajamas , made his appearance and , his towel over his arm , blinked into the golden sunshine . Bronze-colored , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and crackers . From the bathrooms came the sound of splashing from the showers . The ship was awaking . The heat grew more intense . The officer of the watch ceased walking back and forth , raised the long telescope to his eye and stared attentively at the streak on the horizon . Suddenly the ship 's siren blew with a hoarse toot and a deafening howl . In the distance a barely visible black dot was rocking on the water . The ship 's siren tooted again , and the black dot made answer in childish jubilation . The ship was now wide awake . I ran to my cabin and looked round to see whether I had left anything behind . Down there it was stifling hot . All along the passage cabin doors stood open and electric fans were humming . Behind the flapping curtains lay sparsely clad sleepers , perspiring and snoring . The Chief Steward was scolding my cabin neighbor , a planter from Sarawak , because contrary to orders , he had again slept stark naked with his door open . The planter protested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it need jolly well not look in ! " My cabin was empty , my baggage already on deck . I took one more look round : good-by ! Meanwhile the little steamer had come close up , on its bow could be seen the inappropriate name Hercules . Finally it lay alongside , tiny , black , dingy . On the bridge stood a genial-looking , fat , red-faced European in a white suit . The crew was entirely Malay . The man in the white suit waved and yelled to us in Dutch , and the passengers from the big ship answered . Muscular Malay boys with bare backs pulled down our baggage and a few sacks of mail . Dozens of people were shaking hands and tapping one another on the shoulder . " Good-by ... good luck . . . do n't forget the quinine ! . see you again in Europe ! . . . eight years from now . . . . " We jostled one another , clinked glasses , vowed lasting friendships , wrote down addresses , knowing in advance that we should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in this life . The Prinz Ludwig gave a low warning toot , the smutty little Hercules followed it with a nervous shriek . .. . " Passengers for Sumatra disembark ! " came the order from the bridge . Presently Peter and I were aboard the Hercules rocking on the water . The large ship slowly and sluggishly began to move , her propellers beating the water to a foam . Our small Hercules , hellishly hot and smelling of oil , cracking , rattling and puffing turned in a western direction toward the distant streak on the horizon . The large ship was getting farther away , a thick cloud of smoke hung from her funnel arid lay motionless on the air like a dingy black veil . Her siren sounded one last hoarse tooting salutethe waving figures grew blurred ? and suddenly I was overcome by the feeling that my last tie with Europe was now severed . A new life lay before me . A strange , an unknown life . On that old liner there were still white people , the vessel was still Europe . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the smell of oil and dried fish and the muscular , half-naked , brown Malays , this was already the settlement , this was the tropics . II As we drew closer to the coast , we could see nothing but forest and marshland ; nowhere was there a sign of human habitation . Ahead of us in the distance , we saw masts rocking , and the grimy-gray sails of a few fishing boats . From the mainland a terrible stench was wafted over to us , the stench of putrefaction . The bay closed in around us , the banks drew nearer . Behind a bend the harbor lay before us : a few gray hovels of sheet iron , built on piles ; rickety Malay huts made of palm leaves ; a shaky landing-stage , covered with small sea animals , moss and green slime . The mud steamed in the broiling sun , and a gray vapor lay over the desolate region . Slowly we turned in the direction of the landing-stage . A couple of slothful Malays came crawling out from somewhere and flung the cables @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could get off . I took my small trunk and walked a few steps with it . A Dutchman shouted at me in an irritated manner : " Put that trunk down ! " Startled , 1 dropped it and looked at the Dutchman dumbfounded . " What are you thinking of ? You as a European ca n't lug your baggage ! Nothing like that here . Please do n't forget the prestige of the Ihrhites ! " A zealous Malay coolie crept up to us . From afar he had been crawling along with bent back ; now he seized my trunk . With his left hand he held his right wrist as a sign that he asked for forgiveness , and was holding back the right hand with his left in order to prevent its boldly touching the belongings of the tuan . The adat , that is to say , tradition , demanded it . And one must demand the adat from the natives , or one 's prestige is gone . I knew that much already . We white tuans sauntered over the bridge to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there need of them . The coolies placed our trunks in the scorching corrugated iron hut . From a corner , in the semi-darkness , a drowsy half-caste Customs official crawled forward . He said something in Dutch ; the Dutchman answered . Then the Dutchman snarled at the coolie : " A jo , ankat ! " And we passed on . The white man 's word is sacred : if he says that he carries no firearms , then he has none . With shame I thought of our rifles and revolvers , but walked on . Opposite the Custom House was the railway station , a small stone building . There were two railway lines , a little old locomotive with a long funnel , and a few ramshackle open carriages . Beyond the station , forest . Dark , opaque forest , growing out of brackish water , lianas , palm trees , mangrove trees , ferns . The muddy spots showed traces of crocodiles . Presently the wheezing little locomotive carried us panting and puffing into the interior of the island . Here and there an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monkeys was busy in the trees . A large gray monkey with a white stomach was rocking himself on a protruding root , then with a violent swing he shot into the dark-green leaves of the mangrove trees . The troop followed him . They did not run away , for the train did not frighten them . Nowhere a village , or even a house . Not even a coco palm . Only forest and swamp . Presently we saw the first campong . Hidden in the dark shade were huts of palm leaves , a couple of skinny , mangy dogs , naked Malay children with fat bellies . Then again forest , swamp . . . . Suddenly , as if marked out with a ruler , a huge clearing . Ditches dug in a straight line , paths , two-meter high tobacco plants in endless straight rows . As far as the eye could reach , there swayed a light-green sea of leaves , Everything one saw was carefully tended , almost exaggeratedly ordered . Now one plantation succeeded another . One could see regular streets , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all at once we drove into the station of the capital . Everywhere order and cleanliness . Pretty stone building , an iron viaduct , a glass-covered lobby . Native and Chinese coolies carried the baggage , Malay and Chinese travelers poured from the carriages , European railroad officials in white uniforms and red caps strutted up and down like peacocks among hens . In front of the station was a large square . I saw smooth asphalt roads with mighty palms on both sides , pretty bungalows , lovely well-tended little gardens , strange flowers in variegated colors . And at a distance of half an hour from this paradise lay Belawan , the harbor of death , the home of swamp fever and a thousand lurking dangers ; a few minutes from here the impenetrable virgin forest with its slinking beasts of prey , its prowling , treacherous crocodiles , with thousands of giant snakes and millions of malaria mosquitoes ! A few decades ago this place , too , had still been forest . In the station square , neatly in rows one behind the other , stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ row of rickshaws . We entered such a cab drawn by a native . The swift-footed , perspiring brown coolie bore us like the wind to a hotel which lay in the shade of palm trees . III At the front of the hotel was a hall . No , not really a hall , only a roof built on wooden pillars ; the hall had no walls , doors , or windows . To right and left of it were two equally incomplete halls . One was the billiard room , the other the dining room . In the center two semicircular counters , one of them the bar , behind which a Chinaman with the face of a Buddha sat between countless bottles of various colors and sizes , waiting with mute seriousness for orders . Behind the other desk an absolutely identical looking Chinaman was entering the names of the new arrivals in a large book . This group of buildings was connected by a walk covered with zinc plate with two others , long and on level ground . In these buildings were the hotel rooms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each room a bathroom . The one Chinaman entered our names in the large book and then said something to a white-clad Malay waiter . Nor was I surprised that the waiter was barefooted and wore a headdress . He took our trunks and departed with them down the connecting passage . He placed them in one of the rooms and soundlessly withdrew . The furniture in this strange room consisted of a table , a wardrobe , and two curious , somewhat alarming objects : enormous frames , a meter wide and two long , and one and a half meters in height , of thin white netting . " What can that be ? " Cautiously on tiptoe , we approached one of the enigmatic objects . We searched around and felt it , and at last we discovered what it was . Pulling back the flimsy material , we saw a mattress covered with a white sheet , while two hard-stuffed little pillows and a large white sausage were lying inside the frame . " A bed , " Peter declared . " The white covering is mosquito @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " We gazed at it , perplexed , then continued our exploration . A few steps led down to the bathroom . As we opened the door , a swarm of black beetles dispersed : cockroaches . The less agile scorpions retreated more slowly into the damp corners between rotting boards . In a corner of the bathroom was a large cement basin filled to the brim with a yellow , putrid brew . " Swimming-pool , " said Peter , " come and have abath , " but suspiciously he blinked at the moldy corners where the cockroaches and scorpions had disappeared . Shortly afterward we were disporting ourselves , puffing and splashing , in the large basin . It is true the water was tepid , and stank , but in the great heat it was refreshing nevertheless . Suddenly someone knocked at the door . It was the Swiss manager of the hotel , who protested indignantly against our bathing in this fashion . We learned that the pool was not meant for swimming , but represented a water reservoir which one must not enter . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tin pail standing beside it , and then pour it over one 's heated body . That it was dangerous to cool off suddenly ; besides , not so much water could be brought along as to allow the luxury of our taking a full bath three times a day . " Tell me , what is this sausage for ? " Peter asked the Swiss . The sausage turned out to be a guling or , as the English call it , a " Dutch Wife . " When asleep , you were supposed to embrace it and put your legs round it . " Well , we might have thought of that , " said Peter , shaking his head . " Come , let 's go for a walk and have a look at the town , " I proposed . " You ca n't go for a walk in this heat , " Peter objected . " But what about having to work in such heat ? " Peter made a dubious face and stared in front of him . With his handkerchief , which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and neck . " I would n't have thought it could be so hot in this country , " he said , sighing . The streets were swarming with all kinds of motley folk . Along the curbs stood a hundred odd varieties of palm , ramose , mushroom-shaped tulip trees with blood-red blossoms ; in the gardens grew variegated flowers of a type I had never seen , which exhaled a heavy , fragrant scent ; there were black , yellow , and deleted material " Home to Hungary , " he said determinedly . " This is no place for me . I 'm going home . " I was n't yet fully awake , and it took me a while to grasp what Peter meant . I stared at him with open mouth . " You 're crazy , " I declared after a long silence . " Is that what you 've come here for , to swallow quinine for three days and then ignominiously depart ? That was rather a costly joke if it was only a pleasure trip . And all this because your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now I shall be listening to the military band on St. Margaret 's Island , " Peter said gloomily . Nothing that I could say ? though I argued for hours ? would alter Peter 's decision . The Swiss was indignant when he heard the news , and at first wanted to give Peter a hiding . Then he said contemptuously , " Tell that coward for heaven 's sake to get out . We have n't ' any use for such weaklings . To-morrow a little steamer is leaving for the Malacca peninsula , for Penang . There are more boats leaving from there ; he 'll find something to take him on . " The next morning , the sooty little steam engine rattled back with us along the same road we had traveled four days ago . Peter sat there dejectedly , and stared apathetically in front of him . Lord , what was I going to do alone , without a farthing of money ? I did n't know a single person except the rude Swiss in the hotel who treated his guests as if they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stay with him in exchange for their costly money . Peter would be home in a month , It would be summer then . He would speak Hungarian , and sit down in the city park and listen to the military band . And here ? ... My eye wandered over the forest standing in black water ? how would it be possible to get along here ? . . . At home on the Stefanie Avenue swift American trotters would be drawing the little carriages with red wheels , and the music would be playing in the Kiosk Caf ? . I saw my father sitting at the window , smoking his cigar ; if only I had listened to him . When Peter 's boat finally pulled out of the harbor I burst into tears . Leaning against the burning zinc wall of the Custom House , I shook with long-suppressed sobs of grief . The Chinese stood round me at a respectful distance , surprised and curious at the sight of a tuan crying . One of them must have made some joke about the crying tuan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone by the wall of the Custom House and cried as perhaps never European has cried in the harbor of Sumatra . I do not know how long I stood there weeping , but when I turned to see the last of the ship , there was nothing but a black cloud of smoke on the horizon where she had vanished . I stood there with a return ticket to the town and six cents in my pocket , with no one I knew , nobody to whom I could have turned for advice . Fifteen thousand miles from home , I was like a lost sheep . All I had in the hotel was one useless European suit , six shirts , six pairs of drawers , twelve pairs of socks , and in my pocket a silver watch , and an old meerschaum pipe . I thought of ending it all by jumping into the water which was swarming with crocodiles . What matter how one perished ? With six cents how could one continue in a strange land where a white man may not engage in physical labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or a frightened child ? Anyone without courage had no business to be here . The Swiss was right . . . . Hardy youths were needed here , youths who did not immediately get panicky . Not pampered mothers ' darlings . I rattled the six coins in my pocket and , head erect , walked toward the exit . I pushed aside a Chinese coolie who stood in my path , yelling at him and rolling my eyes , just as I had seen the whisky-reeking captain do . He leaped away in terror , joining his companions who were hanging around , and they put their heads together and whispered , pointing at me as one of those strangest of creatures in the world : the whites . Funny , they must have been thinking : he was howling like a kid , and immediately after , for no reason whatever , he thunders and roars like a tiger . For the third time the train was rattling through the country with me . But now I was not despondent ; I sat in the first-class carriage with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , threw out my chest and with haughty condescension flung my ticket at the conductor , who was a native . Only six copper coins rattled in my pocket , but with a dignified nonchalance I held a light to my last cigarette . IV The first thing I learned in Sumatra was that there are two kinds of people in the world : white and colored . The white man is the master , master and ruler in the strictest sense of the word . His very language announces it . He does not ask , he commands . " Boy ! Been " ? and the Javan servant at once runs soundlessly , like a dark specter , to fetch it . The boy from Java stands behind the screen , waiting for your orders , sometimes for hours . And then he will hear a thundering voice : " Boy , beer ! " ? and the Javan , electrified , runs and hands you the cold beer , holding back his forward right hand with his left . Then he disappears again behind the screen , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracks between floor and screen are his bony , brown ankle-bones . Patiently the boy waits , and if you call him , he comes running or creeping up , arching his back . He likes doing it . It is his job . He does not complain , he does not make a face . He serves because that is his destiny . And yet he is not a slave . His humble attitude , his polite movements arc not servile , not the degraded submission , compelled to servitude , of the pariah . No , it is adat , homal ; tradition , a form of politeness inherited from his forebears . He serves because he wants to serve , he serves as the gentleman-in-waiting serves the king . He is polite and observes thecustoms and habits of his forebears as the courtier does his etiquette . If a white man walks into a store , let us say into the store of a Hindoo millionaire ? the millionaire will bow low before the tuan , who may be a runaway sailor or a card-sharper or a swindler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to get into a vehicle , and a colored woman happens to be sitting in it , waiting for her husband who is shopping in a store , she will immediately get out and offer you the carriage . The whites live entirely separate . There are two worlds : the white and the colored . There are separate compartments in the trains for the whites . Not that " Only for white gentlemen " is written on the outside ; there is no written law for it , but everyone knows and observes it . It goes without saying that the hotels , clubs and restaurants of the white man are not open to the colored . Japanese and Chinese , however , do not count as colored . Never should I have thought that just because of my white skin I should some day enjoy so many privileges ! " Boy , beer ! " I yelled so that it could be heard all through the hotel , and a fleet-footed Javan brought the ice-cooled beer and a book of chits , in which I wrote : One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black Tamul tailor came along . Bowing low , he stood on the other side of the railing and repeatedly raised the palms of his hands to his forehead . My suits were ready : a dozen white suits . " Chit ! " I shouted at the contentedly smiling Hindoo . Like lightning he pulled the book of chits from the pocket of his white coat . I put down : For twelve white suits . Signature . Finished . The tailor could go . Then came the Chinese shoemaker . Six pairs of white shoes . All right . " Chit ! " The yellow son of the Celestial Empire gave a jerk , the book appeared : chit for six pairs of shoes . Settled . No one ever paid cash . Everything was done by chits . Known or unknown , millionaire or unemployed applicant for a plantation , it made no difference . If he had money , well and good ; if he had none , neither did it matter . Some day he would have some . And when he had , he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a month , or a year . No one remained in debt . One could buy furniture , a watch , a bicycle , against a chit . One could live for weeks or months in a hotel , and on leaving could write in the chit-book : For three months ' board and lodging . There was never any abuse of this custom . One was a European and kept up the prestige of one 's race . In the hotel lobby the boys ran busily to and fro , the white manager directing and giving orders . A heavy day was ahead ? Hari Besar , the free day of the plantation workers . I was sitting in my capacious cane chair , waiting to see whether something might come along for me , too . The Dutchmen who had arrived with me had found positions long ago , but I was still lounging idly around . I had not succeeded in finding Andor , whose name had been given me by friends at home . I did not know how to set about getting a job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the street which was hazed in the tropical sunlight . The guests were assembling on the large hotel terrace with its laid tables . With a sharp turn , a tiny carriage with gigantic wheels came rolling up . On its single seat , in a white suit , sat a man of huge stature , red-brown complexion , and a grim mustache ; behind him on the step stood a white-clad coachman . With a jerk the animal stopped at the entrance ; like lightning the coachman jumped from the step , stood at the horse 's head , and grasped the bridle . With slow and ponderous steps the tuan walked up to the terrace . " Boy , beerl " rang through the hotel . Presently came others . One buggy after another drove up . The mans from the plantations looked radiant in their crackling , dazzling white suits ; all theirfaces were dark red , and all had shaggy mustaches and close-cropped heads . The hotel boomed . Acquaintances greeted one another with loud cries , there were shouts for the boy , for drinks ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a chaotic buzz ; glasses clinked , corks popped ; somewhere a gramophone was howling : " Dolly , you 're the apple of my eye . . . " and powerful men 's voices tried to make themselves heard above the hoarse instrument . The whole room quivered and buzzed , boys flitted about with alarming quantities of drinks , and the manager agitatedly threaded his way from one table to another . Solitary , I sat at my table , gathering impressions . There were none but men , not a single woman could be seen in the whole room . They were all between twenty and forty . Only now and again did one see an older man . This was the land of the young , the land of the healthy , of those who could work hard . You did not come here to grow old , but to get rich quickly and , after working for fifteen to twenty years , to go back to Europe and live well there . Women , planters ' wives , were stilt rather rare at that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hotel on Hari Besar day . The planters were coarse people , their mirth and their jokes were not intended for women 's ears . The townspeople , too ? the officials and merchants ? preferred to stay at home on such days . To-day the planters could drink and enjoy themselves . I sat at my table and grew sad . How was I to tackle this business ? I had no friend here , not even an acquaintance . All at once a red-haired fellow , as tall as a lamp-post , stopped at my table and made a long speech to me in an unknown language . He gesticulated violently as he spoke , and at intervals he laughed aloud . I sat there looking at him . When he had finished his speech , I told him in my broken German that I had not understood a word of it . " Does n't matter , " he then said in German , " I was merely asking what you were doing here sitting all alone and moping . After all , this is Hari Besar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sitting all alone and drawing such a long face . " He sat down , stretched his long legs , and shouted so that the glasses on the table began to clatter : " Boy ! Beer ! " " I have to sit alone , " I answered , " because 1 do n't know a soul . And I 've certainly every reason to mope . For I 've been here a week already and have n't any work , " I confessed , reddening . " But why not ? " he asked with surprise . " I do n't know . Where should I get work ? " " Where ? ' Well , there , " and he pointed with a broad movement of his hand to the crowded house . " AII these here are planters . They all need hands . To whom have you introduced yourself ? " " To no one , " I confessed in a low voice , " I did n't dare . " " Oh well , of course you ca n't get work that way if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come from anyway ? From what country ? " " I am a Hungarian . " " Oh . Does n't matter , I 'll look after you . Boy ! " The boy swept through the room as if shot from a gun . " Chit ! Kaju Immediately the boy handed him book and pencil . He took them and flung them in front of me . " Write ! " he said curtly . " What shall I write ? " I asked with surprise . " What I dictate , " he answered and began : " ' Dear Sir , 1 should like to speak with you at once , please be so kind as to come to the billiard room for a moment . ' Now , sign your name . " I signed my name , he took the book from my hand , tore out the chit , gave it to the boy who was standing waiting , said something to him in Malay , and the boy hurried off . " Where is he going with that ? " I inquired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " And you would send such a smeary , penciled bit of paper to a director ? " I asked and looked at the man , opening my eyes wide ; and I tried to imagine what the Director-General of a Hungarian company would say to such an application for a job . " Here we do n't make as much fuss as over there in Europe . He can read the chit .. Look , the boy is just giving it to iitn , At the other end of the terrace , in a large party , I saw a corpulent , sun-burned man with a bald head and a large mustache . He read the slip , asked the boy something , and the latter tossed his head in my direction . The fat man looked at me , nodded toward the billiard room , and got up . " Now you go , too , " said my table companion , " talk simply and calmly with him ? and do n't get alarmed if he shouts . That 's a habit with him . He has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " When I reached the billiard room , the corpulent man was already there . " Well , what d' you want ? " said he . " I 'd Iike a job on the plantation , " I started timidly . " Precisely at this moment ? You ca n't come back some other time ? " " Please excuse me if I am disturbing you ... if I had known that you would take it amiss . . . " 1 stuttered and was in the act of leaving again . " Now , wait a moment . Now we 're here , we might as well discuss the matter . How old are you ? " " Twenty . " " How long have you been here ? " " A week . " He surveyed me from head to toe for some minutes . " All right , " be said presently , " this is the sixteenth . Report on the plantation on the twentieth at the head office . Two hundred guilders a month , free lodging , a servant , free doctor and drugs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Chit , kaju The boy came running up , handed him pad and pencil , and the old fellow scribbled something on the slip . " A month 's salary in advance . There you are , " and he pressed the chit into my hand . I looked at the slip of paper . " Where can I cash that ? " I asked in surprise . " Wherever you like . Anywhere . What have I to do with that ? " said the old fellow , somewhat piqued . " Report on the twentieth on the plantation . Good-by . " And already he was off , walking out with large , ponderous , somewhat reeling steps . I stood with the chit in my hand , staring after the old man . Then I looked down at the slip . A chit for two hundred guilders . Under it a scrawl . What did it mean ? Was it a joke ? He did not even ask my name or where I had come from . Slowly I walked back to my new friend whose name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chit . " Well , that went off all right , comrade , " he said . " Now we 're colleagues . That was simpler than you thought it would be , was n't it ? " " Yes , but can I take it seriously ? " I asked , still in doubt . What a strange world , I thought to myself , what strange people . He did n't know my name , nor I his . I drank his beer , grew friendly with him , got a job through him and an advance of two hundred guilders ? everything from a perfectly strange fellow ? and I did n't even know the name of the firm or the plantation at whose head office I was to report on the twentieth . Later I discovered that his name was Dwars ; not that he introduced himself to me , but I heard his friends addressing him by that name . V Gradually quite a party assembled round our table . I did not know a single name , but they all patted me on the shoulder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beer and whisky . The men 's white suits were soon wet with perspiration , and sweat streamed from their shining red faces . The men talked very fast and put away incredible quantities of beer at an incredible pace . For dinner the whole party moved to the dining room . The heat in the overcrowded room was unbearable . White shirts were open to the waist , and as the wearing of underclothing here was a superfluous luxury , one could see plenty of perspiring , reddish-brown , hairy chests . A whole crowd of boys were serving without moving a muscle . Like everything else , the dinner , too , was strange . A dish of rice , a greenish chicken soup prepared with curry and other unfamiliar spices , and countless supplementary dishes . You put the rice in the center of your plate , poured the soup over it , and then the vegetables ? as much of them as there was room for on the plate ? were piled around it . And what you could not put on this plate was placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea crabs baked in oil ; unfamiliar vegetables boiled with strange spices ; goat 's meat sprinkled with grated coconut ; little round cakes of finely crushed sea crabs baked in oil ; ginger gherkins ; paprika siliquae filled with meat ; bananas fried in butter ; small , strongly-peppered fish , done on the grill ; peas that had shoots of from five to six centimeters long ; grated and roasted American hazel-nuts , covered with a horribly smelling liquid ; dried fish , baked in coconut oil ; ground paprika pods mixed with putrid meat : all this served in incredible quantities and on innumerable platters . There were dishes among them that tasted of brilliantine , and some whose putrid fish smell made the eyes of an unsuspecting novice water . But in one respect all these dishes were alike : they were all unbearably peppered . Even I , accustomed as I was to paprika in Hungary , felt my throat burn as if I had drunk vitriol . The tears came to my eyes , and I started to hiccup . Beer was flowing freely , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table next to us a merry planter was dancing a terrible war dance . Plates crashed under his heels , glasses broke with a clatter , those seated around the table joined in the din and beat time with their fists . Dwars seized a half-ripe papaya fruit and stuck it on his neighbor 's head . The green half-globe slid over its victim 's head down to the eyes , orange-yellow pulp squirted out , poured down his white suit and ran into his neck , eyes and mustache . " Hurrah , Jan ! . . . You have got a grand hat , Jan ! .. . " The diners yelled at the successful joke . Jan , the victim , sneezed and shaking himself , flung the remains of the papaya fruit on the floor . But one prank had to be answered by another . Jan did not keep them waiting long : with a jerk he lifted up the large table by one side . With a clatter the glasses flew , the plates fell crashing to the floor , the beer flowed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sauces flowed into the laps of those sitting opposite who , trying to save themselves , had by this sudden movement been flung with their chairs right into the debris , and now lay under the table amid the stinking fish dishes , desperately kicking and screaming . Dwars , too , fell into thebroken glass , blood streaming from a deep cut on his cheek .
