Last week with all the publicity that a U. S. President and two of his Cabinet can drum up , the Treasury launched its drive to distribute government bonds among private investors . In the Oval Room of the White House before floodlights and newsreel cameras Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau and Postmaster General Farley put on a little act which in thousands of cinemansions throughout the land shows President Roosevelt buying the first " baby bonds . " They were the " salesmen " ; the President the " prospect . " <P> Prospect Roosevelt : I wish you would tell me about these United States Savings Bonds which went on sale today . <P> Salesman Morgenthau : The Treasury has decided that every citizen should have a chance to buy sound government securities and become a partner in his government . These bonds are issued in denominations as low as $25 . . . . The $25 bond will cost you $18.75 today . It grows in value every year , and if you hold it for the full ten years you will increase your investment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ want to cash my bond before that ? Suppose I need the money in a hurry ? <P> Salesman Morgenthau : In case of emergency , the Government will redeem your bond at any time after 60 days from the date of issue . <P> Prospect Roosevelt : That sounds like a pretty good proposition to me . I want to buy some right now . Now , Mr. Postmaster General , how do I buy these bonds ? <P> Salesman Farley : It is as simple as buying a money order . Throughout the country these bonds are on sale in about 14,000 post offices . <P> Prospect Roosevelt : Well , I want to buy from you right now six of the $25 denomination , one each for my five grandchildren and one for myself . <P> Digging in his pocket for a roll of bills , the President peeled off $113 . Surprised , Postmaster Farley said something about not having any change , finally fished out 50 , gave it to the President .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
