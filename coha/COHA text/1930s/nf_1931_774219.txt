txt  | If the portrait was a fraud , it was a pious fraud , an excusable one . In perpetrating it , the original blame rests mainly upon Mozart 's first extensive biography , written by Georg Nikolaus von Nissen , the Danish diplomat who in 1809 married Mozart 's widow , thereby legalizing his relations with her , which had probably begun some ten years ' earlier . It is a common thing that people who do not rigorously uphold the conventions behind closed shutters , hang decorum out of the open window . Some are hypocrites , others are not ; they simply lack the energy or the desire to go through the fuss of defying Mrs. Grundy . , If they are " different , " they prefer to be so quietly rather than ostentatiously . Among critical biographers , too , there is the decorous , if not the hypocritical , school ; and there are the fussy , defiant " revelationists . " Neither is apt to get at the truth and nothing but the truth . One paints too rosy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rogues ' gallery are about equidistant from a gallery of master-portraits . If a single biographical master-portrait of Mozart is still lacking , there are scattered all the elements of one throughout the monumental revision of Jahn 's work by Hermann Abert , the painstaking research of Wyzewa and Saint-Foix , and lastly the courageous treatment by Arthur Schurig . But that is comparatively recent history . Nor has all the documentary evidence been produced , more than a century after the case came into court . When Schurig brought out a separate volume on Constance Mozart , he placed the principal blame for this delay upon Johann Evangelist Engl ( 1835-1921 ) , for many years the secretary and archivist of the Mozarteum in Salzburg , " the narrowest head " ? wrote Schurig ? " that I have encountered in my eventful life . He closely kept from every student of Mozart the documents that he was guarding ; and every page that this man has written in his miserable provincial German is full of mistakes or misleading remarks . " On the whole , Constance has fared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been painted too persistently in som-  | bre hues , while on her husband were lavished all the bright tints in the rainbow . Schurig 's is the first contribution toward a fair estimate of Constance Weber . But how fair ? Is it a final judgment ? Does she deserve all the blame that still clings to her ? And if not , is there perchance a modicum of credit due her ? In plumage man and wife differed probably less than is generally accepted . To all intents and purposes of the blessed state called matrimony , they were birds of an identical feather . Lighthearted , both young and somewhat frivolous , of the same caste in a severely caste-divided world , they " fitted , " inwardly and outwardly . What girl of nineteen , what woman of any age , was to have " understood " the composer Mozart ? The man Mozart wanted a wife , he wanted to get away from the Archbishop 's thraldom and from the father 's surveillance . He wanted a home of his own , and he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his married life . Poor Cherubino ! Yet where was Mozart 's choice ? Who were the eligible girls in Salzburg or Vienna pining to marry a jobless and penniless genius ? No one so far has come forward and suggested to whom Mozart should have offered his heart and hand . Did he fail to inspire confidence among the " better families " ? As a matter of fact , those families still regarded a composer , no matter how much they admired his music , as several degrees lower in the social scale . It was not the rule then for a musician to pick a rich bride and sit back in comfort . Gluck married money , but he was the exception ; and his was a love-match consummated only after the bride 's objecting father had died . With Wolfgang and Constance it was the bridegroom 's father who objected , violently , blind with rage , demanding that the bride 's mother , whom he accused of intrigue and connivance , be put in irons and branded as " seducer of youth " ! That there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little resistance ; but allow Wolfgang the modest merit of a facile victory , won without the aid of an indulgent rather than a pandering mother-in-law-to-be . Fate threw Mozart into the arms of the Webers . There was no escape .  | Mozart met Fridolin Weber , Hofmusikus and father of four daughters , at Mannheim in January , 1778 , while on his way to Paris , accompanied by his mother . It was Aloysia , she of the warm , opulent voice , who first turned Wolfgang 's head . But he would have surrendered to any pair of languid eyes and tempting lips . He was twenty-two ; father and mother had kept him too long on the leash . At Augsburg he had found in his little cousin , the " Basle , " first a willing victim to be coaxed into dark corners ; and then he made her the recipient of letters into which drained dark currents of his mind . That was green fruit , and the taste of it unhealthy . But Aloysia , seventeen and a singer of parts ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he wrote to his father ? here was sugared ripeness too sweet to resist . And the poor , worried mother knew it . On February 4 she secretly appended a postscript to one of Wolfgang 's letters to his father , in which she gave vent to her annoyance and her fears . The effect of this news on the father in Salzburg was to be foreseen ; on February 12 he gave his son peremptory orders : " Away with you to Paris ? and soon ! " In Paris , on July 3 , Mozart 's mother died . Wolfgang met Aloysia again about Christmas-time in Munich , where she had been engaged for the opera . But the few intervening months , the change of place and conditions , had made a great difference . Aloysia was blown , flippant , cruel . When she saw Mozart in a red frock-coat and golden buttons , covered with black crape as a sign of his mourning , she ridiculed his " livery . " Mozart retaliated at the piano with an improvised air sung to the classic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retort unknightly . In 1 781 he qualified Aloysia as " a false , evilminded coquette . " The Webers went to Vienna in September , 1779 , because Aloysia , through the influence of her " protector , " Count Hadik , Minister of War , had received a call as prima donna to the court theatre . Fridolin Weber died the following month . Cecilia Weber , the widow , gathered round her the four daughters and ? with an eye to the main chance ? let rooms to " paying guests . " In October , 178o , Aloysia found a husband in Joseph Lange , an estimable  | man and capable actor . He became one of Mozart 's intimate friends . But not until Mozart had written of him almost as disparagingly as he continued to speak of the now definitely lost Aloysia . This was the situation when Mozart arrived in Vienna on March 16 , 1781 . His relations with the Archbishop in Salzburg were near the breaking-point . Cherubino , as afraid of the parental fetters as he was disgusted with the archiepiscopal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Viennese spring , immersed in freedom , drowning in a flood of sensuousness . Events moved swiftly . On May 2 Mozart took up lodgings with the Weber family . On May 9 be handed his resignation to the Archbishop . On June 8 the break was accomplished . Here enters Constance , though for a little while longer she remains in the background . The fulminating epistles which old Leopold Mozart must have sent to his son when he learned of the latter 's new address we can only imagine ? for the letters themselves , all of Leopold 's letters to Wolfgang from January 12 , 1781 to his death , in May , 1787 , have been destroyed ? probably by the one who had the most reason to resent them , who felt least flattered by their damnatory candour . We may be sure that father Leopold fairly bombarded his son with commands to change his quarters . Wolfgang demurred ; on July 13 he still insisted that he could never find a pleasanter , cheaper , or more convenient domicile . What a distant father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . First softly , then with increasing brazenness , they were twittering " things " about the ardent young boarder and one of his landlady 's pretty daughters . The twitter filled the neighbourhood ; somehow it reached Salzburg . In less than two weeks the wind had veered completely , with stormclouds on the horizon : " Mon tres cher Pere ! I say it again , that I have long ? ! intended to take other lodgings , and only because of the gossip of the people ; I am sorry that I am forced to do it because of silly talk , not a word of which is true . Just because I live with them the Webers , I am supposed to marry the daughter ! Nothing is said about being enamoured , they skipped that ;  | instead , I take lodgings in the house , hence I marry ! I never was farther from marrying than I am now . " And more in the same vein . No mention of Constance ; what references he makes to Madame Weber 's daughters and his conduct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playful interest in " the married Mademoiselle . " Aloysia as lightning-rod ! But the bolt is not ready to strike . Instead , a fog descends upon the scene ; for a while we can only dimly follow the action and identify the actors . Is Arthur Schurig right when he maintains that at this point Mozart really had no idea of marrying ? Possibly . Is he right also , when he pretends to distinguish " already " the intriguing hand of Madame Weber ? Did it require intrigue to throw Wolfgang and Constance together ? Cecilia Weber may have " simulated motherly objections , " but it is not necessary to assume that they were calculated to hasten rather than frustrate the union . Wolfgang wrote to his father in the letter of July 25 : " If I were to marry all those with whom I have joked , I might easily have two hundred wives ! " Patently , he was bragging . He was trying to soften the father 's anger and dissipate his suspicions by exaggerating the truth . Still , the " joking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " Basle . " The " joke " was not irreparable in its consequences , except that Wolfgang , far from anticipating Don Giovanni with his mille e tre , or even with a modest two hundred , was captivated and was racked with his desire for the one girl whose intimacy he had been able to enjoy sufficiently to give him a foretaste of what secure , legitimate , and full possession of a wife would be like . Meanwhile the birds continued their annoying twitter . Wolfgang fled them at last ; about September r he took a room " Auf dem Graben . " But he could not flee the birdlime which his own nature had spread for him . On December 15 he sits down and writes to his father , makes a clean breast : " Nature speaks in me as loud as it does in everyone else , and perhaps louder than in some big , strapping fellow . " He pleads his domestic bent , he claims the need of a solicitous housewife . He prepares the father  | as gently as he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chosen one is " eine Weberische " ? dear Constance , " the martyr among them , and therefore perhaps the besthearted , the most competent . " Leopold Mozart 's desperate protests were of no avail . The marriage contract was signed August 3 , 1782 , and on the following day the wedding was celebrated in St. Stephen 's . The irksome period of betrothal had lasted nine months . It did not pass without lovers ' quarrels . Constance was nineteen , seven years younger than Wolfgang . She was a child of her day , almost as light and giddy a day as our own . She committed the modish sin of having permitted a " chapeau " ? a dude ? to measure the calf of her leg with a coloured ribbon , in the sight of other people . Knee-long skirts now make unnecessary such investigation . One hundred and fifty years ago it formed a sort of parlour-game . But poor Cherubino was highly offended at the behaviour of his affianced . He wrote her an indignant letter , upbraided her , and lulled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We have no proof that she was other . The married life of Wolfgang and Constance lasted 112 months ; during 54 of them Constance was with child . The firstborn arrived on June 17 , 1783 , and lived two months ; the last was five months old when Mozart died . Of the six children only two survived their father and mother : Karl ( 1784-1858 ) and Franz Xaver Wolfgang ( 1791-1844 ) . Whatever reflected glory Constance derived in later life from the growing fame of her first husband , while she was his wife her existence was humble , precarious , and none too happy . She gained the reputation of having been a poor housekeeper , extravagant and improvident . That may have been largely reflected odium . During her widowhood and after her second marriage she proved herself the reverse ; she exhibited shrewdness , she reckoned with every kreuzer . In 1808 she wrote to Karl in Milan : " Your last letter did not give me much pleasure , because it contained nothing hearty , and for such a cold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postage . " She avoided using envelopes whenever she  | could , folding the letter sheet after the fashion of the time in order to save on the postal charge . Beginning with 1783 , Mozart seems to have fallen into debts of which he never ridded himself . The letters to his friend and brother-mason Puchberg for small or large loans are pathetic . They were seldom in vain . Yet posterity erects no monuments to mere Puchbergs . Emperors are protected against oblivion , even when they can do no better than appoint a Mozart , after composing a " Don Giovanni , " Ho f kompositeur with eight hundred florins a year . Mozart was then thirty-one ; he had five more years to live . His son Wolfgang at seventeen earned more ; in i8o8 he was engaged as private music-teacher to the children of Count Bavorowski at Podkamien near Lemberg , with a thousand florins a year , lodging , food , firewood , and candles free . And he wrote no " Don Giovanni . " Mozart left his family penniless , burdened with debts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short time . But it was no easy matter . Her first grief stunned her . When Wolfgang succumbed to a " hitziges Frieselfieber , " on December 5 , 1791 , Constance ? inexperienced , impractical , mistaught even ? felt dazed and lost . She is said to have slipped into the bed from which the corpse had been taken to catch the malady that killed her husband . That is probably another one of the many legends . At any rate , she was too ill to follow the bier on December 6 . The story of the funeral , the unmarked grave , remains painful reading . Painful also is the thought of Baron van Swieten , a friend of some means , missing his chance and arranging ? to " protect the widow " ? for the cheapest burial that could be had . It cost eleven florins , twenty-six kreuzer . Constance paid for it . We do not know with whom originated the idea of having Constance submit a petition to Emperor Leopold II five days after the coffin of her husband had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imperial sanction of a benefit concert which took place December 28 ; it netted the widow enough money to satisfy pressing creditors . The inventory of December 19 is a curious document . Among the debts were 282 florins due  | one tailor , 13 florins due another ; 208 florins due the upholsterer ; 179 florins due for medicines . In all , Constance paid 918 florins in debts after Wolfgang 's death ; this did not include any loans , the exact figure of which is not known . Among the assets , estimated at 592 florins , were 6o florins in cash ; a personal wardrobe , including coats of white , bluish , red , brown , black , and mouse-grey cloth , held to be worth 55 florins ; the silverware consisted of three spoons valued at 7 florins the lot ; the two most precious objects among the household goods were a billiard with five balls and twelve cues , put down at 6o florins , and a fortepiano at 8o florins . What would Mozart 's viola , estimated at 4 florins , bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . No one could tell their value . Do we know it now ? Whatever influence Constance had on Mozart , she did not interfere with his work . She may have created a condition to push it . Generally Mozart is credited with having worked harder after his marriage than before . Arthur Schurig , too , speaks of the " enormous " amount of music written by Mozart during those nine years . That becomes easily evident if one consults the Kochel catalogue or the " Nouveau Classement " of Wyzewa and SaintFoix . According to the latter , 381 works fall into the twenty years of composition before the marriage , and 201 works into the last nine years of Mozart 's life . To be sure , many of them are fugitive songs , brief canons , occasional arias , duets , and the like , hastily written for interpolation in other people 's operas , to satisfy importunate singers . There is a perceptible swing in the direction of Mozart 's work , coinciding approximately with the time of his marriage ; and that arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even a casual survey brings out a few facts to which attaches more than a superficial significance . Despite the figures , the " enormous " takes on a qualitative rather than a quantitative meaning , and statistics again would seem to be a dubious guide . After his marriage Mozart composed only 5 of his 46 symphonies , but they were the greatest ; he added no more serenades and divertimenti to the 33 he had written before his marriage . After  | August 4 , 1782 , the date of the wedding , came only 8 of his 23 stage works , but among those were his master-operas ; and " The Abduction from the Seraglio , " of course , was the sweat of the bridegroom-fever that burned his marrow . During his married life Mozart wrote : 11 of his 27 string quartets ( on the last day of 1782 he finished the first of the six quartets dedicated to Haydn ) ; all but one of the piano trios , quartets , and quintets ; only 7 of his 42 piano and violin sonatas ; 25 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for himself ) ; only 4 of his 17 piano sonatas , but all 5 of the piano fantasies ; none of the 17 organ sonatas ; of his more than 40 shorter vocal compositions for the church only the single " Ave verum " ; of his 18 masses only x , besides the final " Requiem . " And that mass was the great unfinished one in C which he had " vowed in his heart " to write for the occasion of his wife 's first visit to his father and sister in Salzburg . The young couple arrived there in July , 1783 . On August 25 the music was performed in the Church of St. Peter , the missing sections being taken from another of the composer 's masses . His vow was kept , his conscience quiet . And to give the event its fullest import , the soprano part was sung by Constance . As a " muse , " or inspiration , Constance would not seem to have been very lucky . For not only this mass , but all the other compositions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unfinished . Not until 18o8 , seventeen years after Mozart 's death , did his widow make any effort to visit his grave ? only to learn then that there was no grave . This has always been considered as conclusive evidence of the indifference with which Constance regarded Mozart . Yet her letters to her sons show that she held Mozart 's memory sacred . On March 5 , 18o6 , she wrote to Karl : " Remember always my earnest admonition , that no son of Mozart 's must be allowed to turn out a mediocrity . " Constance had a musical salon . We know that , in 1807 , Monday was her jour fixe . Musicians from far and near met at her home . Of Seidler , the violinist , she wrote to Karl enthusiastically : " You should hear him play your father 's quartets ! " After Mozart 's death , Constance not only developed orderliness  | and economy ? virtues which were probably latent in her ? but showed musical judgment . Of Asioli , with whom Karl was living and studying in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I know are certainly very empty . " She wanted Karl to study in Vienna with Albrechtsberger , " that dear , skilful man , whom your father so greatly esteemed . " When her son Wolfgang obtained his position as music-teacher in the family of the Polish count , she ascribed it wholly to the fact that he had been a pupil of Albrechtsberger . Her solicitude for her children was as great as her veneration for their father . She displayed sincere emotion when in 1810 she sent to Karl in Milan , with the vetturino Christoforttei , carefully and lovingly packed , " the pianoforte of your father . It is as good as it was , I should say even better than it was ; first , because I have taken great care of it , and second , because Walter , who made it , has been kind enough to overhaul and ref elt it for me . Since then I could have sold it many times ; but I hold it as dear as I do my children , and therefore I shall let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me to take as good care of it as I did and never to part with it . " The instrument is now in the Mozart Museum in Salzburg . When Karl paid no attention to his mother 's wish that he come to Vienna and study with Albrechtsberger , she bluntly put to him the question : " Have you other prospects or are you in love ? " At the thought of marriage she gave him this excellent bit of advice : " Only I beg of you , in case you marry a rich girl , that you will never depend on your wife . You must always try to earn your livelihood and never live on the bounty of a woman . " Family history repeats itself . How like the postscript of Mozart 's mother in Mannheim , with the first " warning " about Aloysia , reads this postscript at the end of a letter from Constance to Karl , dated September 14 , 18o8 : " From Signor Piastrini I learned to-day that you have taken lodgings in the house of a singer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heart forever beating anxiously lest danger overtake her brood ; but a wife 's heart calming down at last in the peace , security , and ease she had not known before . From Copenhagen , on November 13 , 181o , Ma-  | dame von Nissen wrote to her son Karl Mozart : " As far as I am concerned , pray believe that I never was so well off . . . . I have my competence , have a brave , dear husband , who is respected , carries me on his hands , and loves me above all things . " And , loyal to both , she always signed herself after the death of her second husband , in 1826 , " Constance , widow of state-councillor von Nissen , formerly the widow of Mozart . " The Mozart legend is securely closeted within the chambers of countless hearts . Here it rests unassailable , and in each of these tabernacles worship is offered to an idol , smiling under the halo of unquestioned sanctity . How could it be otherwise ? Did ever man breathe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immortal sound ? Yet he stood " at the very junction-lines of the visible and invisible . " Strains of unearthly loftiness mingled with " such a Bacchic reel and rout and revelry of beauty as leaves one staggered and giddy . " There dwelt in his body a double soul , saint and satyr , indissolubly made one . The biographers of Mozart , until the beginning of this century , have blindly followed Otto Jahn in overdrawing the halo and covering up the hornlets . As if the latter could disfigure what can never be anything else but the fairest face in music . Even the lines of anguish , the betraying droop of heavy lids , can not dim the ray of smiling loveliness . Still , on the smile alone were fastened the eyes of all those who have worked upon the legend . In one of her essays , Alice Meynell says that " rather affected objection " is taken every now and then to the publication of certain facts in the lives of poets , although these are all , in the strictest sense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the letters , those of the master himself and those of his prolix father . In some of the letters penned by the young satyr , we catch an unexpected sight of the cherub 's troubled twin : Mozart , composer of the Jupiter Symphony , the familiar of stableboys . Bare of all romantic tinsel , the naked truth only increases the stature of this superchild , until we know not what to marvel at more : the godlike spirit or the human heart torn by passion and woe .  | Let Francis Thompson , better qualified , now have the final word : " The difference between the true poet in his poetry and in his letters or personal intercourse , is just the difference between two states of the one man ; between the metal live from the forge and the metal chill . But , chill or glowing , the metal is equally itself . If difference there be , it is the metal in glow that is the truer to itself . For , cold , it may be overlaid with dirt , obscured with dust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | T a notorious murder trial in Cincinnati , some years ago , a man who had killed his wife entered the usual plea of " not guilty by reason of insanity . " A lunacy commission examined the defendant and found him to be " technically sane . " However , the alienists pronounced him a " dangerous psychopath , " because in their opinion the man was " amoral , lacking a sense of ethics , emotionally unstable , being subject to unrestrained outbreaks of temper and rage , and egocentric to a pathological degree . " The characterization of this murderer fits , word for word , the technically sane musician Richard Wagner . It was eminently sane , and at the same time distinctly amoral , that Wagner appropriated the wife of his friend Hans von Billow , when he found her not only more to his liking than his own , but essential to the completion of his great work . The sense of ethics remained curiously undeveloped in the man who was a master in the art of using and abusing his acquaintances . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we need but look through Wagner 's letters , exultant or hyperbolical at one moment and whimpering or in despair at the next . All his life he suffered from an uncontrollable temper ; his last fit of rage was apparently responsible for the attack of angina pectoris that caused his death . By testimony of friends and foes alike , his colossal egoism knew no bounds . Such was the man Wagner ; a person whom a lunacy commission might have declared a " dangerous psychopath " ? a musician whom the world acclaims as one of the greatest of all times . Destiny , that uncertain agent , is generally held answerable if of two men , afflicted with the same psychopathic shortcomings , one turns out a murderer and the other a genius . The difference be-  | tween the two lies in the different direction and application of the identical proclivities . The criminal is a born law-breaker ; so is genius . The criminal breaks the laws of God and man ; genius breaks the canons of social convention and artistic tradition . The criminal defies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Genius assumes a position apart from and above the rest of humanity ; he is a law unto himself . Haled before the tribunal of human prejudice , he is broken on the wheel of ignorance . Whereas the criminal , as a rule , is bent upon destruction for low personal ends , genius is constructive as well as destructive in the high pursuit of an ideal . The essential attribute of genius is the faculty to create . There is no musical genius that has more lustily demolished and more gloriously built up than Wagner . Although Wagner had the makings of a first-class murderer , destiny ? or inheritance ? gave him constructive faculties wherewith to overbalance his destructive tendencies . By the very nature of his character and his endowments , the man and the artist in Wagner were two separate beings . He himself , undoubtedly , was aware of it . He knew that if his art commanded admiration , his character was not above reproach . He had too much intelligence not to see the conflict . But he wanted others to be blind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends " ( of 1851 ) he announced that he could not consider those his devotees who loved him as an artist only , and withheld their sympathies from the man . And he was right . He could not change ; he had to be taken as he was , even though it meant to put up with the impossible . The one friend willing to take him so was Liszt . In October , 1852 , from Weimar , Liszt wrote to Wagner : " You can not and shall not be other than you are , and so I revere , comprehend , and love you with all my soul . " Liszt , the most loyal and generous of friends , spared no effort in his show of devotion . But eventually he , too , was placed before the grave and hopeless problem of reconciling his feelings for the artist Wagner with those for the man . The problematical in Wagner 's nature , ideas , and work is the reason that more has been written about him than about any  | other musician . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about this extraordinary man , although we have not begun to gain free access to his entire biographical or musical papers . Wagner 's biography , like his autobiography , is incomplete . A prodigious lot of letters is available . But important sections ? those that would help most in rounding out the picture of the man ? are lacking . Perhaps they are lost ; or they may have been destroyed . There is reason to suspect a secret censorship at work in certain quarters . The bulk of the letters which his first wife , Minna , wrote to Wagner have never been published . They may still be at Wahnfried ; and , again , they may not . The rest of the Burrell material , lately come to light , adds much to our knowledge . Wagner 's letters to one of his passing flames , Mathilde Maier , left at her death with the instruction that they should " not be published during Cosima Wagner 's lifetime , " were mildly disappointing . And Cosima , dying at ninety-two , outlived her husband by forty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are seemingly inexhaustible subjects ; partly because a good deal of each has yet to be told or put in the proper light ; partly because the romantic element that so strongly pervades both , his life and his music , is a constant temptation to commentators and rhapsodists . The quarrels , long and bitter , that Wagner 's person and music stirred up in such quantities , are now happily ended . " Der Fall Wagner " ? the case of Wagner , as Nietzsche sarcastically called it ? ? has lost actuality . What anti-Wagnerians we now have in our midst complain , not about the licence , but about the tameness of his music . Such is the speed with which our ears form new allegiances . And yet Wagner 's fantastic story has lost nothing of its romance , and his music is likely always to represent the highest crest of the romantic wave in art . Mozart was fourteen years old when Beethoven was born , in 1770 . Wagner was fourteen years old when Beethoven died , in 1827 . Mozart is the musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the nineteenth century . Beethoven is the towering bridge that connects two epochs , the classic and the  | romantic ? or the predominantly formal and the predominantly emotional . There have always been highly emotional individuals who temperamentally correspond to the type that we call the romantic . It is a psychopathic type . St. John , the writer of the Apocalypse , is an early literary example . Dante is a later one . But after occasional appearances throughout the ages , the conditions that had produced certain " romantic " individuals became general and shaped the mentality of entire generations . The romantic spirit became contagious . Probably the most infectious case was that of Jean-Jacques Rousseau . With him began in earnest the epidemic of morbid introspection , of exaggerated emotionalism , of passionate curiosity about the so-called secrets of nature . Romanticism , in art , was a new order of artistic conceptions due to a psychic disorder in the artist . He lived in a world of dreams . But he found the centre of the universe in himself . Abnormal sensibilities gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to work with black magic . Theoretically , art still dwelt in the empyrean of pure thought . In effect , art caught man where he is weakest , by his sensibility . Wagner described his earliest aim in composition as " a bold glorification of unfettered sensualism . " That was more or less the aim of all romantic art . In its attainment Wagner went farthest . He thought that he was opening a new era . In reality he was the closing apotheosis of a magnificent pathological interlude . Wagner 's supreme position among his romantic predecessors and contemporaries is due not only to his remarkable talents , but to his exceptional chances of unfolding these talents . His mental and physical constitution permitted him to overcome more hardships , and to live a longer physical and artistic life , than was given to any other great musician of his time . Consider what the lives of these romantic composers were : Weber , the first of them , died at the age of 40 ; Schubert died at the age of 31 ; Mendelssohn lived to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell into hopeless insanity at the age of 44 and died two years later , but as a composer he had practically ceased to  | exist at 40 . It was a soft and hapless lot . If Wagner overshadows these men ? some more , some less ? it is principally because he possessed rude health , had tough powers of resistance , and lived out the biblical three-score years and ten . Had he died as young as Schubert , " Tannhauser " would have remained an unfinished opera . Had he lived a creative life only as long as the longest enjoyed by these other composers ? that is , had he died in 1853 , at the age of forty - we should have been without a single note of " Tristan and Isolde , " of the " Meistersinger , " of the " Nibelungen , " and of " Parsifal . " In other words , we should have had not one page of the " greater Wagner . " That Wagner produced those greater works is due to three factors : his phenomenal gifts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ luck . It has become the fashion of late to attack on their human side persons of superhuman achievement . There is no hero who , like Achilles and Siegfried , does not have a vulnerable spot . Saint and sinner may be opposites , though not a few saints reached their blessed state only after they had conquered sin . Genius and sinner are not necessarily opposites ; on the contrary , more often are they identical . We have seen a Wagner afflicted with the psychopathic taints found in a murderer . To spread these taints before the world in an effort to diminish the stature of a giant is contemptible . To dwell on them as a complement often needed in greatness ? mental , not moral greatness ? is legitimate . Only by thus seeing the whole man , down to his lowest depth , can we measure the height to which his mind soared . And were it not for that depth , perhaps the height would never be reached . The complex character of Wagner resolves into a fairly simple and consistent pattern , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " theatrical " type . It is a very common type . There are many excellent actors in this world who never step before the footlights . There are not a few actors to whom the earth offers barely a large enough stage . In a powerful personality , the traits of the " theatrical " type may exert a maleficent or beneficent  | influence , or both . We need think only of Nero , Pope Leo X , or Napoleon I. The chief traits of the " theatrical " type might be summed up as follows : an innate dual or multiple personality ( resulting in duplicity or multiplicity of behaviour ) , an imaginative exuberance , an absorption in unreality , a craving for public show and applause , and a lively dramatic instinct . Wagner possessed all of these qualities . He came by them naturally . He inherited them . They were developed by his early surroundings . His father , Friedrich Wagner , was born in the same year as Beethoven , and died when Richard , the youngest of seven children , was six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was exceedingly fond of the stage and , according to his son Richard , was inclined to take a gallant interest in actresses . When Friedrich 's widow , ten months after her husband 's death , married his friend the actor Ludwig Geyer , the home in which Richard grew up was completely permeated with the theatrical atmosphere . When a boy is seized with the theatrical fever , there is , as a rule , no cure for him . The world of the stage holds irresistible allurements . They emanate not alone from the excitement , the glitter , the crowd , of the evening . In the grey light of the morning after , the wings and the empty pit , shrouded in darkness , have unique and mysterious attractions . Young Wagner surrendered to them completely . While still in school , he wrote dramas . They were of the romantic kind , full of adventures and valorous knighthood . Romanticism had rekindled a lively passion for ancient sagas and tales of mediaeval chivalry . Wagner never outgrew these tales . In Eisleben , where he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the boy ingratiated himself with a soap-boiler 's family on account of the stories he told . His talent for spinning a yarn was precocious . Later in life he was forever reading his dramatic texts to those who woula listen to him . With his strong Saxon dialect he declaimed , and with a profusion of gestures he acted , the involved and interminable narratives of his remodelled Germanic myths . And evidently he carried off the  | illusion so successfully that his hearers forgot that the gods and Valkyries were talking in Leipzig brogue . If we accept Wagner as flesh and spirit of the theatre , the contradictions of his character resolve into harmony . His apparent inconsistencies only accentuate his trueness to type . We understand the ease with which the professed revolutionary and socialist of 1849 , who for thirteen years lived in exile as a " political refugee , " changed to the familiar of kings and princes . We are inclined to forgive the very duplicities of the man to whom life was but a succession of different scenes in which he played different @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had need constantly to defend and save himself for the only business that counted with him ? the act of composing . Creating was a sublime ritual , with the accomplishment of which nothing earthy or profane was allowed to interfere . As a composer , Wagner lived in a state of hallucination and in a world apart . Lack of money , from which he suffered so much , was unbearable to him . Yet it never really hampered his inspiration ; it merely spoiled his joy in life . To escape want , he would curb his pride ; but he never sacrificed an ideal . As Wagner grew older , he became more dependent on external things He demanded not only comfort but luxury ; and his ideas of luxury often showed strange aberrations of taste . To gratify his love for richly decorated rooms and sumptuous garments , he was ready to squander his last penny and run up debts . In the Library of Congress are the garish samples of silk and satin for house-robes , bed-covers , and pillow slips that he ordered from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote to her full of minute directions . The setting and costume for his own person acquired increasing importance . Most often place and action in Wagner 's life suited each other ; be it Paris and poverty , the lake of Lucerne and love , or Bayreuth and beatification . Fortune indulged him by selecting his beloved Venice and a stately palace on the Grand Canal for the final curtain . Wagner 's theatrical instinct led him to dramatize and poetize his entire life . Nor were intrigue and melodramatic complications  | foreign or distasteful to his nature . He could play any part that the circumstances called for . But he was cut out for the spectacular and glamorous leading role . He excelled as a talker , less in dialogue than in monologue . Still , he headed the most brilliant company of players ever assembled . He took pains to surround himself with a cast of friends and admirers who ably supported him in the most marvellous tragicomedy of life . Many of his contemporaries , quite naturally , saw in the protagonist of the tragicomedy only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jester he was too deadly in earnest , for a trickster he was too superb an artist . This impractical hotspur , this rampageous blusterer , was the most methodical and patient craftsman . If a composer 's manuscripts give any indication of his creative methods , compare Beethoven 's feverish scrawls with the cool , collected , neat handwriting of Wagner . Here is evidence of a control which has an almost fatalistic assurance . It is strange to see the musician lay down his pen for a stretch of years , busy himself in the meantime with literary work , and then take up composing again with a fresh vigour and a richer gift of expression . Periods of real idleness Wagner never knew . When he lamented that he needed " rest , " what he meant was leisure to work . His supply of energy was inexhaustible . Tchaikovsky , in a letter from Paris to his brother Modeste , once wrote that he had spent the morning furiously at work in order to earn " the right to do nothing . " Wagner was always clamouring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the right to possess the woman he craved , the right to realize his dreams ; but never did he ask for the right to do nothing . He lived passionately , he loved passionately , he worked passionately ; and he wrote music drenched with all the passion he was capable of . The only frenzy that Wagner never knew was the religious fervour born of implicit religious faith . He was full of passion , but void of compassion . He never experienced the rapture and contrition of Bach or Franck . He believed in himself . His wisdom was the fruit of selfish struggle , not of a man " durch Mitleid wissend . " For a long time he had been an avowed atheist . Christ  | interested him as a dramatic personage . In 1848 Wagner sketched a play with the title " Jesus of Nazareth . " He dropped the plan . Later in life the mysticism of the Christian legends appealed to him . But it was only a superficial and perhaps a superstitious concern . His mystico-symbolical " Parsifal " is first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is theatrical religion ; or the Christian heaven done over by the man who undertook to renovate Valhalla . Nietzsche roundly condemned the text of " Parsifal . " He saw in it , not a profession of faith , but an apostasy . In one of his notes Nietzsche wrote : " Wagner 's Parsifal ' was primarily a concession to the Catholic instincts of his wife , the daughter of Liszt . " Here Nietzsche erred . Cosima 's Catholicism was not very deep-rooted . In the Library of Congress are some unpublished letters of Wagner to the lawyer who handled the divorce of Cosima . In one of these letters Wagner inquired whether Cosima 's conversion to Protestantism should take place at once or later , according to whether such a conversion was needed to facilitate the divorce or her re-marriage . No , " Parsifal " was hardly a concession to the daughter of Liszt . More likely was it dimly and darkly felt or intended as a last challenge to father Liszt himself . Poor , grand old Liszt had been pushed into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Wagner was threatening to monopolize for years to come the opera stage and the concert platform , he took refuge in the music for the church . Then began the period of Liszt 's religious compositions . Here he hoped , perhaps , to find at last a niche for himself that he could keep unmolested . But again Wagner tried to smoke him out with his own fumes of myrrh and frankincense . What Nietzsche objected to , chiefly , in " Parsifal " was the introduction of " the tiresome theme of love " ? as he called it ? into what purported to be the poetic treatment of a spiritual subject . All of Wagner 's stage works are built on Nietzsche 's " tiresome theme of love , " but with variations ; in the minor key of renunciation , and in the major of salvation and redemption . There are tiresome stretches in all of Wagner 's operas , but they  | are not those that deal with love . To him love was the ruling motive in life . It was the core of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the full measure of love came to the man who had written " Tristan and Isolde , " he , too , rose to the stature of his own heroes . From Lucerne , where Cosima von Billow had joined him , he wrote on November 18 , 1867 , to Baron von Diifflipp , the private secretary of King Ludwig , that unless the conditions for the shielding of Cosima 's honour which he , Richard Wagner , laid down in this letter were promptly accepted , he would be compelled to renounce forever the favour and protection of his exalted friend and royal master . This was not a vain threat . Here we have a glimpse of the man at his best and noblest . If he were in the wrong , he would take the consequences . But give up Cosima , never . For above Munich , above the King of Bavaria , above everything , came his need of the one person who had made him feel that under her affectionate and devoted care he would finish his " Nibelungen . " The future proved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that he had been born a Universalgenie ? as the Germans call it ? a universal genius . In the years of Wagner 's adolescence the world had been treated to the sight of two such geniuses with whose fame the earth reverberated : Napoleon and Goethe . The Emperor , at Bautzen , had carried off one of his last spectacular victories on May 21 , 1813 , one day before Richard Wagner was born in near-by Leipzig . In 1832 , the year of Goethe 's death , Wagner ? then nineteen years old ? had tried his hand at some music for Goethe 's " Faust . " When he was twenty-six , he wrote in Paris the orchestral piece known as " A Faust Overture . " Three years before , about the time he had married the actress Minna Planer , at Konigsberg ( so he tells us in his autobiography ) , he was projecting an overture entitled " Napoleon . " He gave up the idea because ( as Wagner writes ) he was unable to decide whether he " should express the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia by a beat of the tam-tam or not . " Tchaikovsky overcame these scruples and in his " 1812 " Overture introduced heavy artillery .  | Napoleon and Goethe appealed to the imagination of young Wagner because they represented the sort of " universal genius " that he was beginning to consider himself . Napoleon was not only the brilliant strategist and irresistible leader of men , the juggler with crowns and thrones , but the daring engineer who provided France with a network of unsurpassed roads , and the wise legislator who gave to his country an exemplary code of laws . Above all , he was the most consummate and resourceful stage director , who never miscalculated an effect , not even in the hour of his bitterest reverses . The dispatch-bearer who brought to Paris the news of the burning of Moscow and the impending retreat from Russia , also brought in his pouch a new constitution for the actors and actresses of the Comedie Francaise which the Emperor had personally drawn up in the smouldering ruins of the Kremlin . France could feel reassured . Goethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , epic , and dramatic poet of his time , was novelist , historian , traveller , geologist , botanist , inventor of a new science of colours , architect , numismatist , collector of antiques and engravings , theatrical manager , and minister of state . In 1825 Goethe told Eckermann that at one time he had hoped to build a German national theatre for the production of his plays ? a hope which Wagner , fifty years later , realized for his musical dramas in the " Festspielhaus " at Bayreuth . Less of a clear thinker than Napoleon , much less of a poet than Goethe , Wagner shared with them a prodigious versatility . At least he did some things extremely well and could not resist dabbling in others that he did not do so well . His mania for writing is a case in point . Wagner was forever scribbling . And to everything that he wrote he attached an importance which he was forever trying to impress upon others . When Wagner , in 1871 , decided to publish a complete edition of his prose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that whoever is master of an art is best qualified to expound that art . This is perfectly true . The trouble is that Wagner was not content to write about the one thing he understood supremely  | well ? music ? but that he pronounced dogmatically on politics , on religion , on philosophy and aesthetics , on criticism , on the peculiarities of the Jewish race , on the drama , on everything that came into his buzzing head and aroused his interest or his ire . The bulk of Wagner 's prose writing is polemic or argumentative . Because he differed from the rest of men , he had need of explaining and of defending himself . He thought that he was setting down eternal axioms , when in reality he played prosecutor or made speeches for the defence , according to which side he was on . In one of his articles he wrote that he was proud , not of his achievements as a musician , but of the convictions he had gained from these achievements , which he was now able to hand down ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were simply those of a man who considers himself always to be in the right , who is driven by motives all of which he deems just , and who resorts to means that he allows no one to question . Wagner was not an original thinker or a true philosopher . He picked up ideas wherever he found suitable ones ? namely , those which lent added strength to his conviction that his behaviour , his actions , his character , his art work , were unimpeachable and unsurpassed . Therefore his artistic theories and his views on life were nothing more than the reflections of his personal development as artist and as man . Artistic theories become unpleasantly loud every time someone shouts from the housetops his artistic contrariness . With theories the artist challenges the world ; he conquers it with master works . When the fight is won , when the truth of a new artistic doctrine has been proved , when the new idea has emerged fully hatched from the egg of theories , then the shell of its early and necessary prison should drop like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must give Wagner credit for having seen this much sooner than his followers did . He knew he had won the battle , long before he had spread his richest banners to the wind of public opinion . In July , 1853 , he wrote from St. Moritz to Liszt : " I do n't care to , I ca n't , and I wo n't theorize any more ;  | and he is not my friend who lures me into this damn business . " Perhaps because Wagner the man had enemies all his life ? hosts of them ? the artist Wagner felt obliged to keep on theorizing to the very end . That Wagner the librettist did not know how to write poetry is now generally conceded . But to say that he was not a poet , that he was insensible to " the poetic atmosphere and aroma of words , " is missing the mark . There are unforgettable lines in Wagner 's plays , there are strains of music which in our memory remain inseparable from the words . There are instances where the dramatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returning Tannhauser 's outburst in the last act : " Schweig mir von Rom ! ( Speak not of Rome ! ) " Here is the real climax of the whole opera ? and it is the words , not the music , that make us conscious of it . In spite of the wonderful symphonic web , there are few passages in Wagner 's operas more tedious than Wotan 's harangue to Briinnhilde in the third act of " The Valkyrie " and Briinnhilde 's defence . Yet Wagner never wrote anything nobler and tenderer than the last words of the sorrowing father when , as a punishment for her disobedience , he takes from his child her divine nature : " Denn so kehrt der Gott sick dir ab , so kiisst er die Gottheit von dir ( For thus turneth from thee the god , thus doth he kiss the godhead from thee ) . " With this cry of the blood ringing in our ears , the marvellous chords of transition ( known as the " sleep-motive " ) well up from the orchestra ; and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wood-winds and the glockenspiel . There is certainly a " poetic aroma " about the words of that simple question which young Siegfried ? who had never known his parents ? asks himself : " Aber wie sah meine Mutter wohl aus ? ( But how was my mother 's face ? ) " Take the soliloquy of Hans Sachs on the morning after the riotous night and his world-wise explanation of the rumpus : Ein Gliihwurm land sein Weibchen night ; Der hat den Schaden angericht . Der Flieder war 's : ? Johannisnacht.  | A glowworm could not find his mate , He did the damage perpetrate . ' T was lilac time ? eve of St. John 's . There are many such instances which show that Wagner could hit on the appropriate verbal phrase , on the felicitous turn of words , or what the French call " le mot juste . " And in such instances the words are appropriate , not only because they fit the dramatic situation , but because they have that poetic quality which unfetters our fancy and makes us read deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They certainly always unfettered Wagner 's fancy and enabled him to write music which helps to make this deeper meaning unmistakable . And yet of any sustained poetic writing Wagner was incapable . All that he needed was now and then ? in the salient moments ? the salient phrase . That sent him headlong into the music and acted like the twist that sets the music-top spinning . Once only did he reverse the process . That was when the emotional climax of his life had inspired him to write the lovely " Siegfried Idyll " for Cosima 's birthday on Christmas-day , 187o . He had put into this music what was best and most lovable in him , his gratitude for the joy over the birth of a son , for the happiness in the shelter of a peaceful home . When he tried to couch these same sentiments in words , he contrived to write two fine lines for the opening , but the rest of the poem is plain doggerel . And in no line did he match the lofty and serene beauty of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the stage , predestined him to become a composer of dramatic music . He did not write suites and fugues like Bach 's and Handel 's , or symphonies like Haydn 's and Mozart 's , nor chamber music like Beethoven 's . These were the masters of a preponderantly formal music . The nearest musical relative of Wagner was , not Weber or Marschner , but Gluck . Wagner wrote dramatic music because he was an absolute slave to emotion . He could not think musically without being stirred emotionally . The most formal piece of music that Wagner ever wrote is that contrapuntal masterpiece ,  | the prelude to the " Meistersinger . " Yet it owed its inception to one of those emotional flare-ups in which Wagner 's musical fecundation produced the finest results . The incident took place on a wild-goose-chase to Venice , in December , 1861 , to revisit his " Tristan " muse , Mathilde Wesendonck , and borrow money from her husband . The story is worth telling in Wagner's.own words : " Wesendonck , who always went about armed with huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once took me with him to see the Academy of Arts , a building which on my former visits to Venice I had only known from the outside . In spite of all my indifference , I must confess that the Assumption of the Virgin , ' by Titian , exercised a most sublime influence on me , so that , as soon as I realized its conception , my old powers revived within me , as though by a sudden flash of inspiration . I determined at once on the composition of the Meistersinger . ' ... I had spent four dreary days in Venice , and now started by train on my dull journey to Vienna , following the roundabout overland route . It was during this journey that the music of the Meistersinger ' first dawned on me . . . with the utmost distinctness I at once composed the principal part of the overture in C major . " This story , no doubt , reveals a thoroughly characteristic and common occurrence in Wagner 's life . An emotional crisis had to start his creative activity . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the truest sense a seer endowed with second sight , who translated into music what he saw and felt . Wagner possessed to a phenomenal degree the gifts of clairvoyance and clairaudience . There is no other way of explaining what he did . If a poetic vision sprang up in his mind , it was accompanied by its musical counterpart . Wagner always heard what he saw , what he felt , what he thought ? and he saw farther , felt deeper , and thought more passionately than any musician had done before him . His faculties of clairvoyance and clairaudience became more and more acute as he grew older ? or the progress continued at least until the completion of the " Nibelungen . " In the music of " Parsifal " there is no really new note . It  | is a musical summing up of the man who had developed his powers to their limit . Yet " Parsifal " furnished the indispensable coping stone to the monument of Wagner 's music . As the monument rose to ever greater height , the builder never ceased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of design . Wagner had no patience with those who were content indefinitely to repeat themselves . In a famous letter that he wrote to Liszt in 1852 he expressed his disappointment in Berlioz because the Frenchman had not developed , had not succeeded in composing something that was different from what he had written before . It sounds as if he were pointing to himself as a model when he writes : " Children , do something new , something new , and again something new ! If you cling to the old , the devil of unproductiveness will get you and you are the sorriest lot of artists . " It is useless to speculate what Wagner 's music would have been like , in the end , had not his first sojourn in Paris , from September , 1839 , until April , 1842 , been a hopeless failure . Had he succeeded in giving " Rienzi " in Paris , and had the production brought him fame and fortune , possibly the world might have lost the revolutionary Wagner for one content to turn out more " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , probability is against it . Wagner , in Paris , did the lowliest hackwork to keep the wolf from the door ; but he never sold his art . To nearly everyone he ever corresponded with , he complained about his lack of funds or openly hinted that a loan or gift would be welcome ; but unlike the letters of Tchaikovsky or those of other prominent musicians , his correspondence is singularly free from complaints that his inspiration was forsaking him . Even while starving in Paris ? starving for food and for recognition ? he went to work on " The Flying Dutchman , " which set the curve for the stupendous arc that his later operas described . Great as the distance between the beginning and the end of this arc may seem , there is no mistaking the connection of the two . The first fruit of Wagner 's and the last do not differ enough in savour to suggest that they grew upon different trees . Nor did the soil that  | nourished them ever cease to drink in the fertilizing influences of predecessors and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music for " Parsifal , " he did not compose better tunes , or melodies of a different cast , than he had at twenty-seven , when he finished " Rienzi . " He never lost his fondness for a certain Weberian sweep of melody and orchestral rush , at times not altogether free from a blustering swagger . In spite of the improved wind instruments that he found pliant to his advancing chromaticism , he never got away from the grandiloquent Beethovenian themes built on the open notes of the valveless brasses . Although in his autobiography ? which swarms with the names of contemporary musicians ? Chopin 's name does not occur a single time , the purling cascades and flowering garlands of sound that Chopin bequeathed to music were a legacy on which Wagner drew heavily until the end . The harmonic opulence and rhythmic nervousness of the Hungarian Liszt passed into Wagner 's music to stay there ; and , admittedly , they gained by the transfer . To certain mannerisms Wagner clung throughout his evolution . The ultra-romantic gruppetto , as an emotional tremor , runs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it still turns up in the most significant place of Kundry 's narrative in the second act of " Parsifal . " In forty-five years Wagner had discovered nothing better . The gruppetto followed by an upward leap of a sixth might almost be called an obsession of Wagner 's . It stands out prominently on the first page of the " Rienzi " overture ; it plays an important part in " Tannhauser " ; Briinnhilde resorts to it in rousing Siegfried to new deeds ; and it contributes notably to Isolde 's final apostrophe . But apart from these tell-tale birthmarks , the music of Wagner in time changed its face so completely as to amount to a transfiguration . On the technical side , the development and originality of Wagner 's music are centred in three points : modulation , variation , and orchestration . Wagner 's increasing mastery of modulatory devices , of thematic changes , of orchestral colouring , constitutes his greatest contribution to music . In these three points he  | showed himself the daring innovator and inventor on whose discoveries all of our subsequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means he could never have originated what he called his " endless melody . " For ? far from being longer than ordinary melodies of four , eight , or sixteen measures ? this " endless melody " is in reality the composite of a limited number of pregnant but short motives , joined one to the other in endless repetition . The marvel , that this repetition escapes being tiresome , is due solely to the infinite art with which Wagner learned to handle the three chief tools of his musical craft . In itself his technical mastery of modulation , variation , and orchestration would have availed him little , had not Wagner learned to produce with these tools results of unparalleled musical characterization , of unfailing psychological effect . Whether it be fire or water he tries to depict , whether it be the dark and clammy caves of Nibelheim or the bright cerulean abode of Lohengrin , his elements are unmistakable , his colours are true . The storm in " The Flying Dutchman , " the " murmurs of the woods " in " Siegfried , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the " Meistersinger , " with the empty , moonlit street of media ' - val Nuremberg returning to its nightly peace ? these are but a few samples of Wagner 's musical brush-work and the vividness of his amazing tonal pictures . He was not only a painter of large canvases , but he excelled as a miniaturist . In a detail , such as the single chord which occurs on the word " blau " ( blue ) when Tristan , in the beginning of the opera , points to the distant shore of Cornwall , we can measure the subtlety with which Wagner 's imagination worked . We may truly say that Wagner had only one sense , his hearing , and that the sharpness of this sense amounted to clairaudience . In a letter to Mathilde Wesendonck that has been often quoted , Wagner confessed that his technique was gradually resolving into a more and more skilful devising of modulatory transitions . No doubt , Wagner was right . And he knew that here he was breaking ground and unearthing virgin gold . But it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ease with  | which he contrived the passage from one unresolved harmony to the next , or from one key to another . The extraordinary part of such mobile scores as " Tristan " and the " Nibelungen " is the remarkable balance and relationship of tonalities that lie at the bottom of these perpetually fluctuating modulations and deceptive cadences . Only within the last three or four years , Alfred Lorenz analysed for the first time in a deeply revealing study the consistent structure of tonalities that forms the hidden framework of these unwieldy scores . Whether Wagner followed herein a consciously developed plan or was guided merely by his unerring intuition , we can not tell ? at least not without knowing more about the sketches of these operas that are being guarded at Wahnfried more jealously than Fafner watched over his treasure . A stout volume might be filled with examples showing the adroitness with which Wagner learned to apply the time-worn device of variation to his melodic material and its harmonic metamorphoses . And it is not " variation " in the older acceptance of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a theme in a display of ingenuity , as we find it in Haydn or Mozart . Nor is it the variation that delights in rhythmic and harmonic modifications of a theme , dear to Beethoven and Brahms . With Wagner a specific motive , to which a specific thought or emotion attaches , is varied or modified according to the slightest change of the thought or emotion . It is psychological variation of a musical theme . A telling example may be seen in the " fire " motive of the " Nibelungen . " From its first appearance in " Rheingold " as the symbol of the fire-god , Loge , until it accompanies the lighting of the funeral pyre in the last act of " The Twilight of the Gods , " it undergoes transformations that are comparable only to the ever-changing flame itself . It is astounding with what psychological understanding Wagner went to work by the time he wrote the score of " Tristan . " There is nothing in all music like the agonizing tension he creates with a motive of four notes the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Isolde 's summons and appears before her . Each faces the other without uttering a word , while in the orchestra those  | four notes , swelling convulsively , are as the spasm that chokes the throat and binds the tongue . And when Isolde and Tristan have regained their voices , that same spasmodic motive rises and falls like the mercury in a barometer , registering the curves of conflicting passions , until the four notes round out , with an ominous storm-warning , the very phrase with which Isolde hails the magic potion that is to seal their doom . Or take what is perhaps the most pathetic moment in the whole tragedy : when faithful Kurwenal , fatally struck , sinks at the feet of Tristan and , clutching his dead master 's hand , apologizes for following him into death . " Tristan ! Master ! Chide him not if thy man would go with thee ! " And as Kurwenal dies , his motive ? and the motive that signifies home , Kareol Castle , peaceful and sunny life ? returns in the orchestra for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make it seem the mere shadow , the spectre of the original theme . It is one measure only in a score inexhaustible in riches . Yet that one measure may well serve as a shining example of what meaning the term " variation " had assumed in music when the sorcerer Wagner put his touch to it . In a broader sense , of course , Wagner 's art of " variation , " in order to achieve its ends , relied on help from the orchestra . In the one measure just mentioned it is the use of the oboes and bassoons pianissimo and of the muted violoncello that gives its unearthly pallor to a musical phrase which had previously appeared clad in the richest orchestral hues . And the colourfulness , the gorgeousness of Wagner 's orchestra was something unknown before him ; he trained our ears to a new volume and a new quality of sound . The horn of Siegfried is no longer that of Oberon . King Marke 's bass-clarinet has nothing in common with the bass-clarinet in the fifth act of Meyerbeer 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prelude and the violins in Louis Spohr 's " Jessonda " are not the same . The mere visual difference between Wagner 's later scores and those of his contemporaries is that which strikes the eye on comparing cotton cloth of a single shade shot through with one or two silken strands of different col-  | ours in a conspicuous pattern , and cloth woven out of a multitude of coloured threads , so harmoniously blended and so deftly arranged that the changing patterns merge one into the other continuously and overspread the entire fabric of brocaded silk and velvet . Wagner 's methods of orchestration are no longer a secret . They have been imitated ; they have never been surpassed . Wagner was the first to raise instrumental polyphony to the pinnacle which vocal polyphony had attained in the age of Palestrina , Lasso , Vittoria , and William Byrd . But whereas these old masters represent the neighbouring peaks in a high range of contemporary talent schooled in the principles of a slowly developed style of composition that originated in the Netherlands , Wagner 's orchestral polyphony mounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sound flowed from its cone in fiery streams of molten lava . Even now it has not cooled entirely ; the glow of it still empurples the sky . If it brought devastation , it also brought unparalleled fertility . Out of Wagner 's volcanic ashes grew harvest after harvest of new music . Since the advent of the newest music ? that is , within the last twenty years or so ? the younger musicians incline to be oblivious of their debt to Wagner . We who have stepped into our fifth decade are the last " perfect Wagnerites . " No person who to-day is less than forty years of age can possibly feel toward Wagner 's music as those of us do who first encountered it not later than at the end of the nineteenth century . Then it was at the height of its glory . It had conquered all opposition . It still retained something of its formidable novelty . The performances of Wagner 's later operas had reached a splendour unknown to Wagner himself . Bayreuth , the Prinzregenten Theater in Munich , were shrines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made annual pilgrimage . And for the faithful not even the beer and sausages in the intermissions of the four- and five-hour orgies could break the spell . Those of us who between 1890 and 1900 heard for the first time " Tristan , " " Die Meistersinger , " and the " Ring , " are the last beings on this earth who will have experienced the impact with the full force of Wagner 's genius .  | If Wagner 's music emanated from a person technically sane but actually neurotic and psychopathic , what are we to think of Debussy , Schonberg , and Stravinsky ? They have taught our ears to hear things which make Wagner seem like a pompous and garrulous but innocent old man . A new age is talking a new musical language . Nothing can stop the course of progress . The seduction that a fresh aspect of beauty exercises upon susceptible natures is very powerful . But while our conceptions of beauty may change according to the eternal law of satiety and variety , the permanency of the master work remains secure . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still looms above his successors as a full-sized master . Wagner 's personality , under the scalpel of the biographer , has suffered the disfigurement of a thorough-going autopsy . The post-mortem of the man 's character reads like the report of a psychiatrist on a criminal or a degenerate . But there are pages ? many pages ? of this man 's music which prove that human frailty was paired in him with superhuman strength of will and boundless creative energy . The combination produced a phenomenon the like of which we have yet to see .  | ( Read before the International Composers ' Guild in New York , January , 1923 ) WHEN WHEN Dr. Burney ? historian of music and father of Fanny ? journeyed to Italy , in July , 1770 , he did so not , like most travellers before him , to see the sights , but to hear the sounds , all the musical sounds of what was musically still the most resounding country in the world . He went about his errand systematically , manfully . Endowed with British thoroughness and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening to operas , oratorios , concerts , masses , private " accademias , " learned lectures ? a record unbroken even by a New York critic in a winter 's season . No piece of music was so humble , no performance so indifferent , that it did not seem to merit a mention in his journal or provide him with food for deep and grave reflection . Thus we are told that at Venice , in August , he heard one night " on the Great Canal " a company of musicians in a barge . The band consisted of violins , flutes , horns , basses , and a kettle-drum , added to which was a singer " with a pretty good tenor voice . " That manifestly was music of the people ? Italian jazz , if you will ? of one hundred and fifty years ago . And when these hired serenaders , duly impassioned , burst into " noise and fury , " as he puts it , our placid Briton made the observation that these , too ? the noise and fury ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that they moved him to ponder " the necessity of discord in the composition of music in parts . " He came to the conclusion " that provided the ear be at length made amends , there are few dissonances too strong for it . " Perhaps it is not inopportune once more to recall this century-  | and-a-half-old opinion , in a day when the art of music , as on earlier and not infrequent occasions , is being accused anew of showing an offensive prodigality in so-called dissonances . Of ancient standing though the charge may be , only recent developments have definitely placed Burney among the major prophets . Unfortunately , we are not in a position to say whether or not the doctor 's ears would have accepted as sufficient the amends that some of our present music makes . It is not unlikely that Burney 's ears , in spite of their owner 's admirable theories , would have completely failed him in a practical test , could he have submitted to it along the Great White Way that represents our " Great Canal " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chilling hall that is the home of our " accademias . " He might have learned , to his confusion , that novel music demands new ears to hear it with . The countless yester-years which sink into the pit of time drag with them innumerable yester-ears . In Europe , Arnold Schonberg 's " Pierrot Lunaire , " when first performed , was vehemently denounced and extravagantly praised . This dissension is typical , not exceptional , where Schonberg 's music is concerned . Repeated ten years later , " Pierrot Lunaire " startled Berlin anew , cleft it into two hostile camps . Far from soothing the savage breast , these strains incited the meek to riot . The lapse of the decade had not softened the current or veered the wind . In the auditorium of the Berlin Hochschule , " Pierrot " brought on a tempest . Not content with hissing , ill-mannered and boisterous members in the audience resorted to antique latch-keys on which to blow more briskly their whistling gale of disapproval . One of the younger critics jumped up on the stage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the noisy objectors a pack of " Lausbuben " ? thus discreetly absolving the gentler and less demonstrative sex ? and told these people that they had no business to come to such a musical event " without the proper spiritual preparation . " Ladies and gentlemen , I should feel an overwhelming sense of responsibility were I to believe for a moment that your good behaviour on the occasion of the first performance of " Pierrot  | Lunaire " in America , depended solely on my persuasive and illuminating talents , or on the success of that " spiritual preparation " which it might seem my privilege to give you . It is fortunate , indeed , that in these climes displeasure at musical performances does not break out in turbulence . So long as in our country it is not made a political issue , we may rest safe that music , be it the worst or the weirdest , will be listened to politely and resignedly . Therefore , your bringing up , your wider acquaintance with ultramodern music , as well as the happy prevalence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such as the public of Berlin doubtless needed . Nevertheless , it is not impossible that even among you there may be some who ? hearing " Pierrot Lunaire " for the first time ? will come upon this music with wonder and uneasiness , if not with a painful start . Now , there is a virtue in being told by the doctor that he is going to hurt us . Prepared for it , we generally find his treatment less brutal than the cautioning made us fear . And sometimes we develop a real passion for our doctor . Therefore some of you might be served by a few words of warning , even though I can not offer you much actual enlightenment . For I may as well confess that , with all my admiration for Schonberg 's originality and mastership , there is in his latest music not a little that I still find somewhat difficult to grasp . This deficiency of understanding implies , for the time being , an occasional absence of profit or enjoyment . And in the things of art , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a usurer and hedonist . As you all know , music , the language of tones , has a peculiar way of assuming , now and then , a new speech . And when it does , the result is more complex than that presented in linguistic evolution . I mean not mere diversity in style such as exists between the Germanism of Brahms or Thomas Carlyle and the Latinism of Debussy or Walter Pater . The music of both composers remains music ; the English of both writers remains English . To be sure there were many who at first could not understand Debussy . Some people are deaf to the magic of Pater 's prose . In Schonberg 's latest manner we are facing something different . It is not only a  | change in style and diction , but an upheaval in syntax and grammar , the bursting flood of a new vocabulary . No wonder that this new language should be a trifle more difficult to make out . What some esteem crude and ugly is evidently the most genuine , the most fitting , expression that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind and heart . Unintelligible though it may still be in spots , the dynamic intensity of it , the eloquence of its inflections , unmistakably prove that this language is fraught with meaning and the sincere desire to convey something deeply felt . We can do no less than pause attentively and wait for fuller comprehension of what unquestionably is masterfully wrought . One of Germany 's keenest critics and most ardent champions of modern music , in speaking of " Pierrot Lunaire , " called it the only problematical music of our day , because it is " the only one of which the laws are still unrecognizable . " The laws of harmony are a shaky structure . Someone is always at it with reinforcements , improvements , and extensions . In the streets of New York , so long as they can not be altered or widened , new traffic regulations must meet the demands of the swelling vehicular commerce . In the network of harmony , so long as it was founded on inalterable mathematical proportions , the rules of counterpoint and modulation were much like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " turn to the right " and " turn to the left " of the police department . And now that the royal road of music has been made dangerous with the congestion of polytonality and the recklessness of atonality , the theorist , or musical police commissioner , will promptly come along with a new set of traffic rules . The number of musical accidents will then decrease , for a time , and a period of relative safety will prevail ? until New York shall have to anchor traffic towers to the clouds , and music adopt measures to prevent the wrecking of skyscrapers by an excess of sympathetic vibrations . If there be aestheticians who have as yet failed to formulate the " laws " that underly Schonberg 's latest music , other composers , either let into the secret by Schonberg himself or through their own ingenuity , have apparently detected his methods . For Schonberg has imitators . Those who are not trying to write music  | in the Schonbergian manner , but strive to listen to it appreciatively , might at a pinch get along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relieve us of the duty to find , if we can , the right approach to Schonberg 's later style , to find the right ears with which to listen to it . The fact that different ears hear different things , or that different beings are variously affected by the same sounds , is at the bottom of all musical progress . It forms part and parcel of what we fondly call " the cultural evolution of the race . " All goes well until we are suddenly confronted with the depressing discovery that evolution has evolved beyond ourselves , that we have reached the point where we can no longer tell music from musical noise . But remember Burney 's prophecy . Dr. Theodore Lessing , a German scientist , has studied the effects of noise in an interesting monograph entitled " Der Larm . " The author claims that the constantly increasing noise which surrounds us has a tendency to sharpen our ear . The louder and merrier the noise , the finer or more complicated the sounds that we are able to absorb with any sort of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown terribly noisy , and at the same time terribly musical . " Thomas Hood said to Schopenhauer : " For a musical people , the Germans are the most noisy people I ever met with . " Of course , the connection escaped him . You will now , I trust , cherish the blessings of greater noise in the happy certainty that America is the musical nation of the future . Whatever we may think of Dr. Lessing 's theories , this much we know : the ear must accustom itself to a sound , or be in a state of preparedness for it , in order to derive pleasure from it . Almost as soon as this has taken place , the novelty , and with it a great deal of the sensuous charm , begins to wane . Because every discord has a tendency to become a concord , when our ear has heard it too often , rarer and subtler sounds , bolder and richer tonecombinations , must be invented . Music must assume a new speech . Where are the days when a diminished seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? In its arpeggiated form this chord survives only in the brilliant improvisations of piano sales-  | men . Where are the augmented triads of Wotan 's Amazons that galloped through so much of post-Wagnerian music ? Even a conservative composer of " blues " discards them now as " too slow . " And for the use of the naughty whole-tone scale every selfrespecting musician , to-day , must apologize . The ear that can thrill to such antiquated stuff suffers from " arrested hearing . " While it may be the lot of any or all of us to find ourselves , some day or other , thus afflicted , there are people born in that state . An ear less fixed and settled , yet not quite ready for the clarinet pieces of Mr. Stravinsky or the violin and piano bits by Mr. Anton von Webern , might be described as possessing " retarded hearing . " The ear that reaches forward , insatiable of new sonorities , is gifted with " advanced hearing . " Every composer of genius has such an " advanced hearing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ genius . In some instances , as that of Scriabin , death comes before the advance has stopped . In others , as that of Debussy , the advance , at first moderate , then strongly pronounced , slackens and comes to a standstill , to be overtaken by other and younger ears . This steeplechase between arrested , retarded , and advanced hearing is known as musical history . In this race , advanced hearing always wins the stakes , backed by the less musical and often totally unmusical amateurs . A musically trained ear , because it probes deeper into the flesh and sinew of sound , because it penetrates farther into the mechanism of the art , has more to feed on . Hence it is less in need of change . That is why so many excellent musicians are Brahmsites or Franckists , and little else . They get all they want in the music of one or two masters , because they get that music whole . Again , the person whose ear listens only skin-deep , or the less musical person , especially the all-round @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ music and is ready to fall into the arms of any other that will bring innovation and relief . Therefore we find a papal chamberlain encouraging the first experiments in opera , at the end of the sixteenth century . Therefore did " der Esel Lobkowitz " get his money 's worth , and more . Therefore , " the Wag-  | nerites , " depicted by Aubrey Beardsley , have become the audience par excellence that has given the greatest aid to all modern music since Wagner . Outside the orchestra of nature , from the roaring thunder to the chirping of a bird , I believe there are only three sounds which from time immemorial , in the Orient and Occident , have retained their unaltered potency ; they are : a mother 's croon , the bell in divine worship , and the bugle that calls to battle . All other manmade sounds have undergone , and are undergoing , constant changes . Noise is becoming louder , more insidious ; our ears are grooving used to music freer and more sublimated . In both these qualities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaves nothing to be desired . It represents a tremendous jump away ? I do not say forward or backward ? I say , a tremendous jump away from music as we have heretofore understood it . Schonberg calls these " three times seven songs " a melodrama . It is the Guild 's most excellent resolve to give only this one work on that occasion , but to play it twice ; once , to enable an attuning , as it were , of our receiving apparatus to Schonberg 's aesthetic wave-length ; and a second time , so that we may get Schonberg 's message , or as much of it as ? well , as the atmospheric conditions will permit . Some day , perhaps in our own lifetime , we shall have returned to the custom of a little " Hausmusik " after supper , and young friends dropping in on a Sunday evening may take our copy of " Pierrot Lunaire " from the shelf and read it off at first sight with ease and comprehension . For the time being , a performance of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Darius Milhaud 's word for it that before these songs could be given in Paris under his direction , in January , 1922 , the singer , or rather " speaker , " of the words , Mme. Marya Freund , a highly intelligent artist , required two rehearsals daily for six weeks , while the instrumentalists met for twenty rehearsals of three hours each , until the ensemble was tolerably perfect . No doubt the knowledge of such colossal difficulties overcome will inspire many a hearer with solemn awe . Again , it is reasonably certain that there will be others ready to feel with  | Dr. Johnson , who upon being reminded by a friend that the feat accomplished by a celebrated violinist to whom they were listening was extremely difficult , replied : " Sir , I wish it were impossible . " But Johnson was deaf to the charms of music . The texts of these twenty-one songs are by Albert Giraud , and were written in French , or more precisely in the French of a Belgian . There is a difference , as M. Milhaud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Erich Hartleben . When Giraud 's " Pierrot Lunaire " was published by Alphonse Lemerre , in 1884 , its author was twenty-four years old . Schonberg was ten . Schonberg wrote his settings in Berlin when he was thirty-eight . The first , " Mondestrunken , " was written on March 30 , 1912 ; the last to be completed was " Kreuze , " on September 9 . The forty rehearsals which were needed before this work could be given its first public hearing , that same autumn , started before the music of all the numbers was finished . The score was published in 1914 . Giraud was a native of Louvain . His real name was Kaeyenberg . He was for a time one of the editors of " La Jeune Belgique . " That was a good many years ago . The men who then unfolded the banner of youth in Brussels caught in it much of the wind that came down from the Parnassian heights of France . V'erlaine 's " Fetes galantes " started a run in moonlight revels , with pale Pierrot as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the night . Giraud 's book entitled " Pierrot Lunaire " ( la , er included in his " Heros et Pierrots " ) contains fifty rondeaux ; each has the prescribed number of thirteen lines , with but two rhymes ; the first couplet of the first quatrain is repeated as second couplet of the second quatrain ; the last line of each poem is a repetition of the first . The pattern soon palls ; the contrivance becomes monotonous and all effect of spontaneity is lost . Hartleben 's translation does not attempt to rhyme , which is one advantage ; it also varies the metre , which is another . But it retains Giraud 's order of lines , without which , obviously , there would be no rondeaux ; it succeeds in doing so only with the aid of copious dots , dashes , and ellipses . Now , if anything could be more wearisome than fifty  | French rondeaux , chiefly mauve and pearl-grey , it is difficult to imagine ? unless it be fifty German translations of French rondeaux , chiefly pearl-grey and mauve . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ song , " Der Dandy , " with Giraud 's " Pierrot Dandy , " in order to see how a very little word omitted here and another added there alter the particular nuance in a colour scheme in which demi-tints predominate and often take the place of high-lights . When we look in the present direction of poetry , we must confess that , had not the composer Schonberg been attracted by these lunary fancies , there would be little temptation to turn back for a discussion of either Giraud 's poems or Hartleben 's adaptations . Schonberg chose twenty-one from among fifty . There was wisdom in his moderation . The selection and arrangement were evidently made with a distinct plan in mind . We can only guess at the intention . The result awakened in Mr. Paul Bekker ( a fervid convert of Schonberg 's ) impressions of a " Romantik im Zerrs piegel " ? romanticism in a distorting mirror ? while a French critic in the " Revue musicale " spoke of a " psychologie romantique tourmentee " ; and lastly Mr. Edwin Evans found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of three different national tastes affected in pretty much the same manner . No doubt this is due primarily to the choice of texts , to the poetic " Vorwurf , " as they would say in German . And perhaps it is not without significance that one of the few phrases in the score which are to be actually sung by the reciter is one of three notes in " Rote Messe , " over the words " sein Herz . " With your permission , I shall now quote a paragraph from one of Schonberg 's essays : " I have written many of my songs to their very end , intoxicated with the initial sound of the first text-words , without bothering in the least about the further course of the poetic happenings ? indeed , without realizing them in the least during the trance of composing ; and only after days did it occur to me to see what really were the poetic contents of my song . It then proved , to my great astonishment , that never did I do fuller justice to the  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with the initial sound , I divined everything which evidently and necessarily had to follow this initial sound . " This very interesting method apparently applies to translations as well as to poems in their original language . The first of the " Pierrot Lunaire " rondeaux which Schonberg set to music was the one which is No. r in the finished work . In the German translation it begins : Den Wein den man mit Augen trinkt , Giesst Nachts der Mond in Wogen nieder . Which is : The Wine we drink in with our eyes , At night the moon pours down in ripples . Such is the initial sound that inspired Schonberg to compose " Pierrot Lunaire . " Such is the keynote ; and everything else " evidently and necessarily " had to follow this initial sound . Which might lead a facetious person to remark that of all inebriating liquors the most dangerous is moonshine . Once we give up the attempt to fathom why Schonberg thought this symbolic , moony salmagundi , this show of sentimental puppets , a fitting carrier for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a music as that which he has written for it , we have but to take that music for what it is , detached and different from any other music we have known before . Then it becomes our duty to acknowledge the particular mastery that is Schonberg 's , the cleverness with which he has subtilized and diversified the sonorities of each song . Instead of a dull monochrome , we have the most amazing expressiveness and the most refreshing variety of tonal colour that could be obtained from a modest group of eight instruments , in the hands of five players . When the poet as in No. 8 , " Nacht , " and No. io , " Rote Messe , " has given the musician an opportunity to use stronger pigments , Schonberg takes advantage of it and achieves a surprising richness of tone . It is these marvels of sheer sound , unheard till now , as  | yet uncatalogued , bewildering and tantalizing , and they alone , that disarm criticism and defy analysis . " L'alphabet m'appartient , " said Casanova . You all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disquiet timid hearts , it certainly did no great violence to the alphabet . The case is a different one when Schonberg seems to say : " The scale is mine , " and proceeds to prove it . Here are the same twelve tones of old , but in horizontal and vertical combinations and permutations of such novelty that the effect is baffling to ear and eye alike . Yet , the first surprise over , one begins to recognize familiar faces in the picture of the score . Rhythmically , above all , things appear much as they have been for some time . Indeed , there is often a rhythmic soberness which , if disappointing to some , must be reassuring to others . While there is infinite elasticity within the musical phrase , and utter freedom in the reciting voice as well as in the accompanying instruments , no unusual or intricate measures are indulged in . We meet even with the rhythmic interdependence born of a canonic pairing or a fugato . In fact , these venerable contrapuntal devices bob up continually . Not only simple @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diminution are drawn upon to lend , here and there , organic firmness to the texture . In the eighteenth number , " Der Mondfleck , " we come upon a veritable piece of medæval cunning . The piccolo runs like a shadow on the heels of the clarinet , or , to be exact , at a distance of two beats , while the violin leads the violoncello , canonically , by a whole measure . Arrived at the middle of the tenth measure , these four instruments retrace their steps , in a merry crab canon , and not without politely reversing the precedence . Meanwhile the piano goes its own unperturbed way in a busy fughetta . Dr. Egon Wellesz , commenting on this tour de force , admits that not in the whole of musical literature , not even in Bach 's " Kunst der Fuge , " is there anything to compare with it ; and he stresses the point that this artifice is not an end in itself , but is justified by the text , which reads : " A white spot of bright @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promenades in the soft evening . "  | This , it must be conceded , is very ingenious . It leads to the question how far , in other instances , the music of Schonberg succeeds in interpreting literally , or by association of ideas , the meaning of the spoken word . Even to broach this question is enough to convict me . For has not Schonberg himself told us that it is nothing but a convenient shift , if the musical critic , unable to grasp the music , solemnly babbles about a composer 's not doing justice to the poet 's words ? But to say that he did , in this instance , would be convicting the composer . Alas , no , the music is better than the words . The composer , prefatorily , warns his players not to create the mood and character of the music out of the sense of the text , but to take their cue merely from the music itself . Where musical illustration was intended , it will be found anyway and does not have to be read into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the harmonic fibre of this music , only the very rash or the superlunar will venture , or be able , to say what it is all about . Fearless Dr. Eaglefield Hull , who is at home in every kind of modern harmony , says that " we are much too close to Schiinberg 's music to be able to assess it at all properly . " Is that meant to be inclusive of himself ? Does that pledge us to silent acceptance , and leave all the pleasant fuss to our grandchildren ? We must remember Schonberg 's own words : that the artist does not create anything because others may deem it beautiful , but because he , the artist , deems it necessary . When Schonberg 's settings of poems by Stefan George were sung for the first time in Vienna ( January , 191o ) , the composer wrote a sort of manifesto for the programme , declaring that he followed only the dictates of an inner voice , not the traditions of an absorbed and superseded training . Nowhere does this become clearer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : disconcerting because of its inexplicable force ; disconcerting by the very lack of amends that Dr. Burney demanded ; disconcerting as a piece of impeccable workmanship ; disconcerting especially because , all reservations and exceptions noted , there remains the impression of one possessed , tragically possessed , if you will , by the demoniacal  | powers of imagination , one who is mingling in his delirious speech the accents of a fiery tongue on which descended the spirit of a new revelation . There are passages in this score that are as a pencil on a child 's slate , as gall in the mouth . There are others that grip and enthrall . Oblivious to aesthetic doctrines refuted , to scholastic rules disproved , we are willingly mastered by the intensity or sublimation of the sonorous phenomenon ? unstable and elusive ? which we still call music . M. Charles Koechlin , after the performance in Paris , could do no less than write : " C'etait de la musique . It is the music of one gifted with the mystic powers of second sight and second hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colombine " ; to the sombre spectre of night , stalking round to the tune of a passacaglia , while giant moths strangle the sun with their black wings . Mark the flute 's anxious fluttering in " Der kranke Mond " which is heard again as a postlude to " Enthauptung . " Look carefully at the instrumentation of that page in " Die Kreuze " which tells of the poets who are slain , and bleed to death upon the holy crosses of their verses . Your sense of irony will help you to catch this or that musical aside . The whimsicality of the " Serenade " can not escape you . And if you are at all sentimentally inclined , the closing number of the work , " 0 alter Duft , " is sure of its appeal . Here again the German translation fails to identify the scent , to suggest the particular " vieux parfum vaporise " that is evocative of les bleus Elysees Oil Watteau s'est eternise . SchSnberg 's setting is desperately nostalgic . We feel the distance of time and space that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a memory . But who will say that it is the land breeze from Cythera we smell , or a drop of Pompeo Vandini 's Bergamot on a piece of old lace , or what ? The musical means with which all this is attempted , and not a little of it accomplished , are at times very complex , and again  | most simple . The technical skill exhibited in the instrumentation is the outstanding achievement . The flageolet chords of the piano we have encountered before , in Schonberg 's " Drei Klavierstiicke . " There are undoubtedly mannerisms in his music , and some of them may prove irritating . Schonberg 's " melodic line " has often a restless way of jumping back and forth from one register to another , in intervals larger than that of an octave . The effect is almost that produced by the changing voice of a pubescent boy . Overdone , the trick becomes exasperating . The atonal nature of this music need not frighten us . What seems unbearable to-day may be mellifluous to-morrow . The amount of pleasure that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be determined , after all , not by the arbitrary count of unamended dissonances , but by the degree to which the triad WatteauPierrot-Schonberg enters his conception of a concordant trinity . Anyone curious to explain the paradox presented in this music , the mixture of aggressive modernity and evident lapse into a blissfully somnolent past , may find a hint for a solution of the problem in that last number , " 0 alter Duft . " There Teutonic , world-wide sentimentality stands revealed in all its blushing nakedness. " 0 alter Duft aus Marchenzeit . . . " a longing for the past that lies destroyed , destroyed by us ; homesickness for the land of fairies , by us deserted . Here is the tragedy , but it is not Pierrot 's . He does not age , he knows not past or future . It is ours , we who are struggling ever onward , ever backward looking . And when we leave the concert hall , astir under the impact with this new " Zukun f tsmusik , " might it not so happen that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonbeams on water , to hear a band of violins , flutes , horns , basses , a kettle-drum , and " a pretty good tenor voice , " while the bells of San Giorgio Maggiore and those of the Salute are exchanging midnight greetings across the Giudecca ? And there , those figures in long capes , slipping under the felze of their gondolas , are they not returning from an " accademia " at the Grimani 's and delightedly discussing the new sonata with which Maestro Galuppi favoured the company ? .. . " 0 alter Duftl "  | L'orgue de Barbarie , clans le crepuscule du souvenir , m'a fait desesperement rever . STEPHANE MALLARML SOME of us who have not yet been privileged to enter into direct communication with the spectral world still find in dreams the strangest of our terrestrial experiences . And of all dreams , those that we are consciously spinning in moments of an intensified wakefulness ? which has of sleep the peculiar quality of rendering us insensible to our immediate surroundings , while it begets a swifter pace of thought than does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most wonderful and most inexplicable . It was not , as in the case of Mallarme , a hand-organ , with its joyously vulgar tunes , with its old-fashioned and banal song of the faubourgs , which made me dream so desperately . Nor did it happen in Mallarme 's favourite season , the dying days of summer . It was on an afternoon in spring , at the side of a crackling fire , for which a wet and chilly relapse into winter formed a more than plausible excuse . And it was a story by Maurice Renard , " La Mort et le Coquillage , " which started all the trouble and sent me on the melancholy and meandering road to music we shall never hear . But the story , of course , is far more musical than any handorgan can ever expect to be ; and I feel that I should here reveal a little about this extraordinary tale , which is the fourth in a book of seven , one weirder than the other , and all by the same author . Nerval , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stroke of apoplexy . He had been at work , for years , on his masterpiece , " Amphitrite . " The prelude , representing Neptune 's  | train , is a gorgeous riot of tones , of strange , unheard-of harmonies , leading to the brutal chords with which the Tritons announce the approach of the Sirens . But at this point the composer 's invention stopped short ? he is incapable , is utterly unable to write the haunting song of the Nereids . It is a large sea-shell which came from the beach of Salerno , picked up one evening from the mantelpiece in Nerval 's room , that suddenly exerts its unsuspected spell over the despairing musician . He casually holds it to his ear , and what he hears is indescribable . He is hypnotized . Like a prehistoric phonograph , the shell has preserved the sound of miraculous voices , and there can be no doubt to whom they belonged . He rushes to the piano and tries to write down " la divine clameur sexuelle " of these women that followed the God of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of paper , covered with vain attempts at a transcription of this incredible chant . At two o'clock in the morning Nerval , exhausted , gives up the quest ; at four he begins to tremble with fever ; at half past five he falls against the marble mantel ? dead . The shell drops to the floor and breaks into a thousand splinters . The narrator ends with the question : " Pourquoi riezvous ? " and I almost believe that you are smiling , too . But that is my fault , due to my imperfect sketch of an astonishing tale . Read it and you will not laugh . More than that , you will understand the reason for this long preamble . Supremely futile as it may appear to speculate on the sweetness of the Sirens ' song , there is no denying that futile occupations have a charm peculiarly their own . I am inalienably attached to them , and I have long since learned that what my sterner friends brand as a " waste of time " are the happiest hours of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever-shifting flame , until my pupils seemed to burst my head , until my ears began to catch long-forgotten sounds , which the relentless tide of time and fleeting fashion had swept into the background of oblivion . I realize that if I want to tell you something of my shadowy escapade , I must be very careful not merely to offer a long list of names and titles , plucked at random from the past . For the  | graveyard of music is a spacious acre , and labyrinthian paths wind through myriad rows of unremembered tombs . Many stones have crumbled ; they bear no longer the slightest trace of deed or date . Too many , alas , of these graves are the tragic , though well-deserved , repositories of still-born effort . Much music lies buried there that never should have seen the light of day , that never held a spark of life . Countless fresh mounts testify to an ever-increasing mortality . On the other hand , there remains not a little music that is enjoying an unnatural longevity .

We may be justly grateful if we never hear it . But that the Sirens ' song should have perished , unrecorded , is certainly regrettable , in spite of its reputed dangerous effects . Malicious tongues have it that the fatal consequences were due to the extreme impurity of intonation indulged in by the ladies ? listeners preferring to commit self-murder rather than stand the torture . This theory presupposes such an unreasonably superior sensitiveness on the part of ancient tars that I am wholly disinclined to give it serious consideration . I deplore the loss of all the music to which Greek mythology makes such frequent and glowing reference . ? And yet was not perhaps Arion overrated ? Would Orpheus in our day still work his magic ? The widowed bard charmed beast and tree ; he dared descend to Hades . Would he have the courage to step before that modern monster , a concert audience composed of critics and connoisseurs ? ? Hellas was not the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hebrews tells of remarkable feats . What did the trumpets blow that felled the walls of Jericho ? Some learned Rosicrucian might possibly tell you that these destructive buglers carefully ascertained the " vibrations " of the city 's mural defences , and then lustily blew a chord which corresponded to their number . Did King David , on his harp , use the little finger as well as the others ? What was it the Children of Israel refused to sing , by the rivers of Babylon , when their captors required of them one of  | the songs of Zion , and a song of mirth above all ? ? The answer is difficult , perhaps impossible . Still , we are here no longer upon entirely uncertain ground . Many of the traditional tunes preserved in the Jewish worship date from a dim and distant day . Some of them are melodies of surpassing beauty and true Oriental line , though hardly the expression of great mirth . They would suffice to make one feel , in looking backward over many centuries of musical development , that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have good cause to be sorry . We have not missed so much , perhaps , in not having heard Nero sing his own odes with a wine-worn voice . He had spared no effort to cultivate the art of singing and had placed himself in the hands of Rome 's ablest vocal instructors . Did he not , upon the advice of one of these worthies , lie flat on his back for hours , supporting the weight of heavy stones on his chest , to strengthen the muscles of his diaphragm ? It appears that the methods of singing teachers have not materially changed throughout the ages . It is difficult to conceive how Italy , how the whole of Europe , could have offered these maestri a large enough field of operation , if their countryman Columbus had not opportunely discovered America for them . ? I will confess that I would give much to have heard Saint Cecilia extemporize upon the organ , if for no other reason than to be able to disprove the contention of those hypercritical historians who argue that the titulary saint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that no CavailleColl or Skinner existed in her day . Be that as it may , she was fortunate in having the most famous artists idealize her in painting and sculpture , which gave her as much posthumous advertising as some of our living and constantly photographed organists attain only by the ruthless dissemination of their innumerable poses . But let us take a short cut to yonder corner of the cemetery , with its long tiers of urns , of table-tombs , of weeping angels , shaded by willow trees and yews . It was not very long ago that these names which now you can hardly distinguish were on everybody 's lips , were praised and worshipped . What are two  | hundred years ? They are enough to wipe out everything except a short , cold , matter-of-fact note in the biographical dictionary . The transitoriness of mundane glory is nowhere demonstrated with more cruel certainty than in the realm of arts and letters . Nature 's law is unalterable . The stately sunflower that proudly raised its head must sooner or later fade and wither , like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secluded nook and was content in pouring out its little soul of nectar . In fact , I am inclined to believe that , of the two , the violet 's fate is , if anything , the less bitter . For though its perfume be but a memory , we are apt to keep it pressed between the leaves of a beloved book . The sunflower knows no such sentimental aftermath . Sparrows come and pick the seeds . Charles VI , of the House of Habsburg , had succeeded his brother Joseph as Roman Emperor of the German Nations . He inherited not only a throne , but wars to wage and arts to cultivate . He neglected neither . The affairs of the Netherlands and of Spain having been settled , the Emperor , nine years after coming into power , decided to take formal possession of one of his most valuable crown-lands , and in 1723 he went to Prague for his coronation as King of Bohemia . To flatter the crowd and to impress the kings , his brothers , he planned to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this sort was complete without music , and it had to be music in its most regal form , the opera . Born at the court of Florence , the opera has always remained a princely offspring , notwithstanding all efforts to breed a species that would more nearly approximate popular taste , and that could be maintained by popular support alone . Charles was very fond of operas and had his private composer supply him with a new one whenever wanted . Johann Joseph Fux was undoubtedly an excellent musician , and Vienna had no other to compare with him . ? In 1714 Fux wrote an opera , " Elisa , " for the birthday of Charles 's aunt , Archduchess Elizabeth Christina , which made a sensation . The Emperor was so pleased with the work that at the third performance ? being himself a dilettante of no mean ability ? he played the clavecin  | in the orchestra , while the composer turned the pages . Fux , to compliment his imperial master , remarked what a pity it was that His Majesty had not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he was perfectly satisfied with his position . ? For the festivities in Prague , Fux , who was then sixtythree years old , had written " Costanza e Fortezza . " The Emperor had spared no costs in engaging the best singers of the day . An orchestra of more than a hundred men had been assembled from all over Europe , under the leadership of Caldara . Among the violinists was Tartini . Quantz had come from Berlin to play the flute . With him journeyed Weiss and Graun . Prague was a beehive of musicians ) . The excitement was great , for rumour had it that Fux was too ill with the gout to leave Vienna . But the Emperor would let no gout interfere with his plans to honour his dear composer , and by his orders Fux was carried in a sedanchair all the way from the Donau to the Moldau capital . At the gala performance , which took place in the open air , it was not the Cardinal-Primate of Prague nor the Elector of Bavaria who sat next to the newly-crowned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his feet bandaged in cotton . Quantz , to whom we owe many sagacious observations on the music and musicians of his time , wrote about this opera : " The composition is more churchly than theatrical , but very splendid . " Quantz did not care very much for Tartini 's playing . He admired the beautiful tone and finished execution , but thought his style dry and lacking in charm . Another violinist in the orchestra was Nicola Matteis , who had written the ballet music interpolated in " Costanza e Fortezza . " Matteis was born in London , of an Italian father . In 1737 , at Shrewsbury , he gave young Burney lessons in French and in music . Burney tells us that he excelled in playing Corelli 's sonatas . We still occasionally hear Corelli 's " Follia . " But of Matteis 's music there remains as little as of the many operas by Footnote  | the great Fux , in spite of the fact that Fux was probably one of the most celebrated men of his age , the author of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's expense , a monumental work for any theorist to have written , long used as a text-book . Mozart and Haydn studied it . I have mentioned Quantz . His long association with Frederick the Great is known . Frederick 's passion for the flute was pathologic , as was his attachment to dogs . His greyhounds accompanied him on campaigns , following the King 's travelling coach in a landau of their own , with two footmen in the back who were strictly enjoined not to address the royal favourites with the too familiar " thou . " His flute was Frederick 's inseparable companion , until he began to lose his teeth . It is half past five in the afternoon . A rich sunset glow is painting fireworks upon the tall French windows of Sans-Souci , which rises serenely above the crest of its little hill . Quantz and Charles Philip Emmanuel Bach ? more famous in his lifetime than his father ? are slowly ascending the vine-covered terraces that lead to the castle . They are lost in conversation . On each new level they stand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trip to Italy , in 1725 , and of his great admiration for old Alessandro Scarlatti , whom he visited in Naples and to whom he was introduced by Hasse . That name irritates Bach . He will have none of Hasse , even though the people go wild over his music , and though Philip V , at the Escurial , suffering from manic depression , can be induced to go to sleep , every night , only after hearing the glorious castrato Farinelli sing an aria from one of Hasse 's operas . These tunes are superficial , too sugary and Italian . They will not live . Musique d la mode is ephemeral stuff . And as to the fabulous sum that Hasse and his wife , Faustina , are drawing at Dresden , it is preposterous . Quantz promptly changes the subject and tells of his love affair at Naples : how his life was threatened by a jealous rival , how he had to flee to Rome . They laugh ? but the proximity of the august presence quickly stifles their merriment . Sentinels are posted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quantz and Bach enter the ante-  | chamber and exchange greetings with the courtiers . It is only petit cercle this evening . A member of the Academy of Berlin , Dutchman by birth ; an English officer , just arrived , the bearer of a diamond-studded snuff-box with the miniature of George II and a letter from His Britannic Majesty ; a general of the Guards , who fears the Austrian fire less than these musicales ; two chamberlains ? and the illustrious Monsieur Voltaire . These form the audience . No women . The subdued chatter in the antechamber continues while the King is heard preluding and practising scales , preparatory to the concert . At the stroke of six the doors of the music-room open . Frederick , flute in hand , graciously receives his bowing guests . The candles in the large glass chandelier sparkle in the hundreds of crystals . A silver candelabra is placed on a little mahogany table next to Frederick 's music-stand of rosewood , inlaid with ivory , a present from his sister , the Margravine of Bayreuth . The walls are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis at Versailles , on a sideboard stands a beautiful vase , the work of the young chinamanufactory of Berlin , in imitation of the Bourbons ' older Sevres . And the French philosopher completes the setting for this imported Kultur . Only the music is German , though that bears strong transalpine traces . The programme consists of three concerti for flute and clavecin . The first and third are by Quantz . The second is by the King ; that is , he has sketched out the flute part , and Agricola , pupil of Johann Sebastian Bach , has provided the accompaniment . This is entrusted to Charles Philip Emmanuel Bach , playing one of the new " fortepianos " made by Gottfried Silbermann . He has a hard task , since the King is somewhat absolutistic in his tempi .. Quantz , unperturbedly , beats time . But that is not his sole charge . The piece ended , he is the only one who is permitted to say " bravo " or express any praise for the royal flutist , it being taken for granted that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he does . ? Friedrich Christian Fasch , who after 1756 alternated with Bach every month in accompanying the King , at his first appearance , unwarned , burst into loud applause , which nearly cost him his posi-  | tion . ? After the third concerto has been finished , a few words are exchanged . The King has a jest for Voltaire , to which the Frenchman answers with an epigram . The English officer is the recipient of a kind word of thanks . Then the doors open again , and in the antechamber wait three couriers with dispatches from Silesia , Poland , and St. Petersburg . They turn with a click of their heels and spurs , and follow the King , who is humming the andante from the last concerto on the programme . And Quantz wrote something like three hundred for him ! Frederick had one great admirer ? not as a flute-player , but as an engineer of battles ? and that was Bonaparte . Napoleon visited the dead King 's Sans-Souci , and the rock crystals on the lustre in the music-room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Frederick 's sacrosanctum . That night Napoleon had his field-bed placed in the late King 's chamber . Did he dream of flutes or flintlocks ? There are other questions relating to Napoleon and music that are still unanswered . Frederic Masson , who investigated everything concerning the great Corsican , his person , family , household , and reign , including the price paid for his socks and razors , has left here a lacuna . It seems fairly well established , though , that Napoleon did not have real understanding or taste for music , but that he admitted its value , and even its necessity , in certain circumstances . He did not care for Cherubini ; in fact , he harboured an unexplained animosity against him . But he affected the keenest admiration for Paer . After a performance of Paer 's " Achilles " at Dresden , in 18o6 , Napoleon , with the right of the conqueror , claimed the composer from the King of Saxony and gave him a brilliant position . Pak had to follow the Emperor to Posen and organize musical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it looked well in the eyes of the awe-struck nations than on account of an unquenchable desire on Napoleon 's part to be soothed by dulcet strains . He very seldom stayed for the whole of any concert given at the Tuileries . But at St. Cloud , among his family , he demanded , if he did not enjoy , " a little music . " He liked to  | hear his stepdaughter and sister-in-law , Hortense , sing him Italian romances , which she accompanied herself . Hortense Beauharnais , wife of Louis Bonaparte , Queen of Holland , is said to have had a very pleasing voice , which she inherited from her mother , whose bad teeth and beautifully modulated speech were the occasion of much contemporary comment . Hortense even composed ; at least , she is reputed to have written the well-known air " Partant pour la Syrie " in collaboration with Louis Drouet , a mere boy when he was made solo flutist to the King of Holland and " musical secretary to the Queen , " later entering the services of Napoleon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borghese . His life was full of adventure ; in 1854 he visited New York . Another sister of Napoleon , Elisa Bacciochi , had at her miniature court in Lucca no less a musical entertainer than Niccolo Paganini . He played three evenings a week . But he had to avoid harmonics . For Paganini 's flageolets made poor , hysterical Elisa swoon . There is one instance , however , where Napoleon showed serious preoccupation with music . It was the eve of his expedition to Egypt , shrouded in impenetrable mystery . With the thoroughness that marked everything he undertook , he wanted historians , scientists , artists , poets , and musicians to accompany him to the Pyramids . Arnault , in his " Souvenirs d'un Sexagenaire , " tells of these elaborate preparations . Bonaparte had declared : " Il nous faut un barde qui chante a la tete des colonnes . " Besides the poet and composer he wanted a singer . All three were to be attached to the First Consul 's own person and were to receive six thousand francs each , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Maul too much work , and Lays , with the star tenor 's characteristic regard for the interests of the public , claimed that a sea voyage might cost him his voice . Maul recommended Henri-Jean Rigel , " habile pro fesseur de piano , " who conducted the opera installed at Cairo and gave there his own " Les Deux Meuniers " in 1799 . The singer chosen was Guillaume Andre Villoteau , who had been choir boy , dragoon , student of medicine , and who achieved fame with his studies of the music  | and musical instruments of Egypt . What an enterprise , and what a stage-manager was Napoleon ! Picture him on board the Orient , a night of Mediterranean splendour , his generals grouped around him , eager expectation in the mind of everybody , and Villoteau calmly singing an air from " Belisaire , " by Philidor , prolific operacomposer and champion chess-player of the world . Maul , whose setting of Andre Chenier 's " Chant du Depart " was one of the grand songs of the Revolution , had obtained his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tunes for the French armies . Did he write any ? What has become of them ? Did Napoleon , on his white horse and in his green chasseur uniform , enter Berlin to the tune of one of them ? When the circumspect Prussians returned the visit , they had provided a " Pariser Einzugsmarsch . " The whims of Bellona are strange . Napoleon , after three days of carnage at Leipzig , in October , 1813 , saw his luck turn . He was beaten by his father-in-law , Emperor Franz of Austria , musical amateur and quartet fiend . Franz entered the city , which the fleeing French were leaving , with the remark that at last he would find leisure to play a little chamber music again . The imperial quartet was always behind the firing line . At the head of it ? if there could be another head than the Emperor himself ? was Franz Krommer . Born in 1759 , he was only three years younger than Mozart and he survived Beethoven by four years . Showing in his early youth great talent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the munificence of rich noblemen , until he obtained a sinecure at the Viennese court , in 1812 , as " doorkeeper of the royal bedchamber . " In 1814 he was named Hof kapellmeister , a title which has covered a multitude of mediocrities . But Krommer was by no means considered such in his lifetime . On the contrary , he enjoyed the greatest popular favour . He was the composer of chamber music par excellence . He is responsible for no less than twenty-two string quintets and more than sixty string quartets . While Beethoven 's quartets were understood and lauded by a few , Krommer 's were played literally wherever four people got together to scrape the catgut , and , in those days ,  | that meant everywhere . Quartet-playing , in the period of transition from clavecin to hammer-klavier , from Silbermann to Erard , had become an epidemic . It was the house music of rich and poor , of cultured and simple folk . Musicians played Mozart , Haydn , and Boccherini . Amateurs had Rosetti , Fesca , the two Rombergs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and seventy works of chamber music , lived from 1763 to 1850 , and dismissed Beethoven , Weber , and Schubert as " chaotic . " They had furthermore Pleyel , Rode , Neubauer , and Onslow ? poor Onslow , the prototype of the highly cultivated and refined composer , the pet of society , admired for his " originality , " called to succeed Cherubini at the Institut de France , and soon forgotten . Musical history is full of Onslows ! We can hardly conceive how difficult it was for Beethoven to break up this cohort of quartettists , and it is not surprising that these difficulties should have made him feel disappointed and embittered . H. W. Riehl vouches for the truth of the story according to which both Krommer and Beethoven were guests , one evening , at Count Lichnowsky 's palace in Vienna . During the opening number of the programme , a quartette by Krommer , Beethoven showed such undisguised contempt for the less gifted but more popular colleague , by talking and sneering , that the host had to take him to task @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the musical firmament of Vienna at the beginning of the nineteenth century , there was none perhaps who with a gentle little twinkle succeeded in producing as dazzling effects as did Sigismund Neukomm . Josef Haydn had been a father to him and taught him all that could be taught . After journeys in Sweden and Russia , Neukomm arrived in Paris about 1812 . Talleyrand , the Machiavellian , who was the only one to see beyond Napoleon , had just lost his private pianist , Johann Ladislaus Dussek . Friends recommended young Neukomm , and he obtained the position . Talleyrand became very fond of him . He took him along to the Congress of Vienna , and there a Requiem for Louis XVI , composed by Neukomm , was sung at St. Stephen 's before an audience of  | kings and princes . Several hundred singers took part in this memorable performance . And to think that for such an occasion no worthier composer could be found ! Neukomm travelled much . He went to Brazil , in 1816 , with the Prince of Luxembourg , Ambassador of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scott met him the year after . He accompanied Talleyrand to London in 183o , and liked England so well that he settled there . He visited Algiers , Constantinople , Greece , and was on the point of embarking for New York when sudden illness overtook him in Manchester . He probably wrote more than one thousand compositions . To this day , the Universal Catalogue of Pazdirek contains three full pages listing works by Neukomm which were evidently published at some time or other . Neukomm wrote songs and choruses to texts in German , French , Latin , Russian , Italian , Bohemian , Portuguese , and English . Have you ever heard anyone sing them ? Fetis , who saw him in London and later , in his travels , at Paris and Munich , unwittingly pronounces judgment over this amiable , generous , tactful man by calling him " un artiste respectable . " In the fight for the fittest the respectable artist has slight chances to survive . Fetis , the incomparable lexicographer , in his arduous researches must have been appalled by the number @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of their music which is hardly remembered by name and of which never a note will sound again . And since he laid down his pen , the amount has grown incessantly . But there are things that Fetis heard which we shall never hear , and which we may well envy him . Should you not like to have been at Lord Saulton 's , in 1829 , the night when Fetis accompanied at the piano Henriette Sontag and Marie Malibran , who sang a duet from Rossini 's " Semiramide " ? I should . And I should have liked to have seen Henriette 's , then Countess Rossi 's , return to Covent Garden in Donizetti 's " Linda di Chamounix , " when the Grand Duchess of Strelitz , Princess of Cambridge , had secretly commanded London society to be in their seats at the opera when the overture began , and to rise to their feet when the star appeared . That night , between the acts , even  | old Wellington , the Iron Duke , hobbled behind the scenes to kiss the tips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a fascinating tale retold on a thousand nights and one . There are lesser lights with whom I should be fully contented , if only they would shine into the dark and dusty recesses where gems are hidden and are persistently overlooked for the sake of obvious and tawdry Brummagem that basks in the sun of popular approval . Shall I ever hear Schumann 's " Im Zwielicht " and " Auf einer alten Burg " ? When will singers realize that the loveliest of Faure 's songs are not among the scant half-dozen which form the sum of their exploring ? Singers would derive greater help from looking into a geographical atlas than from the study of publishers ' announcements . A recent recital programme contained a song by Augusta Holmes , once a sure winner , now but seldom sung . It recalled to mind the role she played in the life of Henri Regnault , the painter with a tenor voice . Regnault had twice unsuccessfully competed for the Prix de Rome . His third attempt , in 1866 , was threatening to be another failure , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Mme. de Sainbris 's the young composer whose strange and lovely physiognomy captivated him . He made two sketches of her that night and in twelve days he completed the painting " Thetis handing the arms to her son Achilles , " and the goddess bore the traits of Augusta Holmes . He won the coveted prize . The letters which he wrote to his father and friends from the Villa Medici contain several passages on musical matters in Rome . Camille Saint-Saens , who used to delight the circle at Regnault 's studio in Paris by playing for hours from the scores of Wagner , had sent to his friend , in April , 1867 , a " Veni Creator , " in manuscript , with the request that Regnault submit it to Abbe Liszt . Regnault describes his visit with a painter 's sensibility . He relates how he rang the bell and felt his heart thump as if he were at the door of the dentist . The grand old man received him with une amabilite charmante , praised the motet , and then played excerpts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Regnault was in the seventh heaven . Who would not have been , in  | his place ? There is an account of an amusing incident in a letter written in January , 1868 , when the painter was very much occupied with his first envoi , " Automedon and the horses of Achilles , " which now hangs in the Boston Museum . Regnault says : " My little director " ? the painter Hebert ? " asked me last Sunday to render him a service which , I confess , cost me a great deal and did not fit in at all with my present state of mind . He had asked the French Ambassador to dinner , together with sundry duchesses , countesses , and the like . He was to entertain them , in the evening , with a concert of chamber music , performed by the best players of Rome . But the musicians were obliged to attend a rehearsal at the Teatro Apollo that night . M.

Although I was in no mood to appear in public , I did my best , so as not to spoil the party . On a ete satisf alt . " That is true modesty , befitting a real artist . What did Regnault sing for his illustrious hearers ? Surely a song by Augusta , most likely one by his friend Camille , and possibly one by Emile Pessard , whose portrait sketch he made in 1868 . Nor was this the only occasion on which he sang publicly . In March of the same year he sang the tenor part in a requiem mass at the church of Saint-Louis des Francais , in Rome , for the unveiling of a monument to the memory of his fellow student Deschamps . All the other singers were professionals . " Les premiers chanteurs et les plus forts instrumentistes de Rome pretaient leur contours et it s'agissait de ne pas faire rougir l'Academie de son tenor . L'eglise etait remplie , et bon nombre d'etrangers avaient gig convies . Tout a bien marche , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is just and pardonable pride in that remark . More glory would have been his had not a Prussian bullet , perhaps the last one fired before the walls of Paris in 1871 , killed the patriot , silenced that " voix si douce et si penetrante , " as Arthur Duparc called it , and robbed the world of an astonishing painter , whose genius had hardly begun to develop . Melancholy as these retrospects may be , the thought is even  | sadder that it will not be possible for us to hear all that the future holds in store . Mingled with this regret there is also something of disquietude . Thomas Alva Edison has delivered us into the hands of posterity . We shall stand utterly revealed , from " That Chicken Pie " to Caruso 's Cite gelida manina . What will music be like in a hundred years , when the phonographic records of our luminaries , kept sealed in the vaults of the Paris Opera , are solemnly turned on ? Ah , if one could hear ahead !  | Le pantalon De @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ celebrated " Pantalon " ) IT WOULD seem fatuous , in one so destitute of Terpsichorean accomplishments as I am , to attempt a discourse on the dance . Far be it from me to feign an authoritative air in speaking of the technical side of dancing as an art . Pleasurably moved or keenly stirred by performers on the " light fantastic toe , " and heartily appreciative of the eccentric or riotously gorgeous spectacles that modern ballets offer us , I must plead ignorance of the completest sort when it comes to " entrechats , " " pirouettes , " and " chassez-dechassez . " I might as well confess that I am no dancer at all , and that I am equally unqualified to pronounce myself on the relative superiority of the " fox-trot " over the " turkey-trot , " particularly as I suspect that the remembered store of my zoological and ornithological studies would be of small consequence in settling so delicate a matter . What I am in quest of are the physiological and psychological principles that underlie the quickened and accentuated movements of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem , offhand , a forbiddingly dry and unimaginative way of approaching a subject that is sheer animation and fancy . Yet , in the last analysis , the value of all so-called historic or scientific investigation depends not alone on the establishing of more or less authenticated facts ; their presentation and interrelation can gain coherence and reality only when they become amalgamated by an added pinch of " such stuff as dreams are  | made of . " Perhaps it may appear , in the end , that I have helped myself rather generously to that precious ingredient . But let it not be forgotten that in curiously probing the past and questioning the future , we resemble the tourist who is climbing a mountain . We ascend the foothills and gaze on the plain ; we rise to the highlands , whence we can see the valleys and trace some of the rivers to their sources . From the loftier peaks we can make out the distant sea ; but alas ! on reaching the summit , eager to set our eyes upon the farther shore , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So shall I ask the reader to follow me , in discussing the dance , from the level of substantiated fact , over the crags of scientific hypothesis , to an altitude of vague and cloudy , though none the less absorbing , speculation . Let us , then , look first for the physiological basis of dancing . The quickened and accentuated movements , to which I have referred , spring from the normal walk or the natural gestures of a human being . However , unlike the ordinary walk or actions , they are not prompted by a utilitarian motive , that seeks the accomplishment of some ulterior purpose , such as the walking toward a definite goal or the handling of a specific implement . In order to constitute a dance these movements must be an end in themselves , and must , above all , be governed by ordered progress , or rhythm . By rhythm we understand a periodicity of movement , noticeable to our senses as recurrence of visible events or patterns , or as repetition of audible or sensible accents and beats . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word derived from the Latin noun pulsus , to which the ancient Romans attached such diverse meanings as to use it in connection with bloodcirculation and breathing ; with the motion of feet and oars ; with incentive to will and imagination ; and finally with such widely but regularly spaced occurrences as the solstice . In order to realize how all-pervading this periodicity of movement is , we need only remember the measured ebb and flow . It is the kernel of all such phenomena as sound , as electric currents of varying frequency ; we follow this  | pulsating or vibratory motion , as it becomes more and more rapid , through the different stages in which it appears to us as heat of increasing intensity , then as light and colour , continuing to about 750,000 billions of rhythmic oscillations per second , which are needed to produce that sombre effluence known as the ultra-violet ray of the solar spectrum . Science has gone beyond this point , although much that lies behind it remains still unexplored . What we know to be a certainty is that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large or infinitesimally small movement in this world ? everywhere we detect some form of ordered progress , or rhythm . Is it , then , to be wondered at that man is built on a similar plan ? His heart-beat , his breathing , his walk , under healthy conditions , are rhythmic . The mainspring of the human organism , like that of a watch , must keep strict time ! We have not , as yet , gained a clear insight into the subtle connections between the law of rhythm and those of gravitation and maintained energy . But it is more than likely that the reasons which make rhythm essential to man hold good for the whole universe , and that nothing can better explain the omnipresence of rhythm than its economic or , if I may term it so , its conservant and labour-saving properties . These beneficent attributes of rhythm are , consciously or subconsciously , guiding every step we take , every move we make . It was a momentous day in the evolution of man when he discovered that by regular ? that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whatever limb he used in his work , eliminating thereby the necessity of mental exertion in the control of muscular effort ( a thing doubly hard for primitive man ) . He learned to save his strength , and found that rhythm made work easier . The manual labour of man , as an individual and especially in a group , is unthinkable without adherence to rhythmic precision . Thus the Malays row to the sound of tam-tams ; the Arabs pound their coffee to the hum of a rhythmic drone ; in China even the whipping of culprits was regulated by the beat of an accommodating drum . In the museum of the Louvre there is a little terra-cotta of very old Greek origin which shows four women  | kneading dough to the accompaniment of a flute-player . And to this day , domestic , agricultural , or industrial labour obeys this rhythmic law . The concentration of group effort can be achieved only by sounds which succeed each other at regular intervals and emphasize a rhythm that is felt individually , by each worker , and is responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sailors ' chanties , the marching-songs of soldiers . These practices date back , undoubtedly , to a dim and distant past , when they were even more needful than they are in our motor-driven age . We find a curious instance in Athenaeus , according to whom the trumpeter Herodorus of Megara , at the siege of Argos , had the power of animating the troops so much , by sounding two trumpets at a time , as to enable the soldiers to move a ballistic machine close to the rampart , which they had in vain attempted to do for several days before , on account of its enormous weight . Now , the playing of one man on two trumpets , contrary to Athenwus 's inference , had no part in the success of this exploit . It was the trumpeter 's signal , or rather his repeated signals , that enabled the men to work in concert at their military engines , for want of which signals their previous efforts had been scattered and ineffective . And here I should like the reader to ponder what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trumpets blew that had such disastrous effect on the walls of Jericho . In an age that knew not the use of steam or electricity , and in which the simplest mechanical devices were comparatively undeveloped , the only method of moving heavy objects , such as battering rams , was by the combined force of a great number of hands , timing their muscular impulse to given signals . And thus the signal probably came to stand for the action ruled by it . Therefore the trumpets circling seven times round the mural defences of Jericho must have meant that the battering rams had to be applied seven times to various parts of the fortifications before the conquering breach was made . This knowledge and rational view of what has long been allowed to pass as a miracle does not  | materially add to the sum of human happiness , but there is a certain solace in what is more than a suspicion ? namely , that the age of wonders probably never existed , or has not yet begun ? which for all practical purposes of the present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power over the movements of the human body lies primarily in the fact that the rhythmic sense is innate in man and that any appeal to this sense is not only general , but contagious . Herewith we turn from the physiological to the psychological properties of rhythm . The infectiousness of rhythm may be observed , with mingled feelings , at orchestral concerts when some misguided enthusiast , seated behind us , is tapping with his foot an obvious measure against our chair . Nor are these " assistant conductors " the most musical members of the audience . On the contrary , the rhythmic pleasure derived from hearing music is the lowest form of satisfaction that this art is able to afford . Savage tribes , as a rule , content themselves , for what we might call " musical entertainment , " with hammering on all sorts of drums , the beats ranging from a simple and stolid repetition to a remarkably involved and furiously aggressive metre . Thus we see that rhythmic motions of the body have their physiological foundation in being natural and helpful to man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ also pleasurable . But pleasure is not the sole nor the first psychological motive for dancing . This pleasure , consciously sought and found , is of a higher order only when the rhythmic motions of the body become eurhythmic ? that is , when they follow some aesthetic ideal and assume the character and responsibilities of an art . Primarily , these dance motions are , as I have said , merely emphasized gestures . And , as such , they are nothing but the bodily reflex of heightened emotions , or affects . As our emotions are directly influencing our heart-action , by quickening or accentuating our pulse , so do they react upon the quickened or accentuated movements of the body . In these bodily gestures which are inseparable from certain affects , I would place the origin of all dances . Awe , fear , anger , joy , lust , are accompanied by movements of the  | body indicative of the particular affect that causes them . Each affect , according to its nature , inevitably throws the body into an attitude of attack or defence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for , an object or person . Granted that dancing is nothing but a deviation from our walk under normal conditions , and takes on more or less the form of skipping and jumping , let us remember that the horse , when frightened , no longer walks , but jumps ; that the dog , in anger or joy , skips about and rises on its hind legs ; that in mating-time the restlessness of certain animals leads them to perform what for want of a better term we can only call a dance . It is to heightened affects , then , that we must trace the psychological roots of dancing . And the next conclusion , supported by the theories of modern psychology , is that ? vice versa ? agitated movements of the body will induce a corresponding state of agitated emotion . Now , the elementary emotions , such as awe , fear , anger , joy , love , must be occasioned in man by his relation to a source or cause outside of himself . I should class these affects or emotions , according @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of : 1 . man to the supernatural , or God ; 2. man to man ; 3. man to woman . This leads to a classification of dancing into its three great groups ; namely : 1 . religious dances ? to worship or placate a deity , or to incite an ecstasy of spirit in the dancers ; 2. war dances ? to intimidate an enemy , or to incite a heightened aggressiveness in the dancers ; 3. profane dances ? to further the relations between the sexes , or to incite a greater passion in the dancers . Everything that has been called " dance " in the history of mankind may be referred to one of these three groups . And in each instance the psychological motive becomes self-apparent by the very character of the dance . There remain , however , two interesting questions not answered by this classification . One is , why the first and third of  | these groups show recurrent tendencies toward degenerating ; the second , why these tendencies should coincide with periods during which the live forces of humanity are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one is tempted to ask whether the dance in its acutest form and ultimate purpose is not really a reflex or stimulus of the strongest and most fundamental desire in man : his hunger for individual projection of life , the instinct of race-preservation in the masses . Is it a secret aim of Nature , in times when our life-blood is ebbing too fast , to repair the waste by arousing this hunger , this instinct , more strongly , more brutally , and , one might say , more shamelessly ? It is certain that whenever the need of new vitality seems greatest , the passions are permitted to hold full sway in a dance that disregards all our acquired notions of propriety , that grows into a manic obsession . Let us inquire into the history of the three groups of dances , with particular regard to these tendencies . Sacred pageants seem to be as old as the first devotional rites of man , dedicated to that mysterious being which ordered life and death , ruled the thunder , sent rain or drought , and bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whatever visible image men gave to this mighty power , they were awed by it into a kneeling posture of humility , their bodies writhed in fear , or , moving round in stately procession , they offered thanks and praise to their master . Before the black bull Apis , symbol of creative productivity and fertility , the priests of Egypt , in their strange attire , performed a cadenced round , as the stars encircle the sun , giver of life , ripener of all fruit . Down to the earliest religious demonstrations we can retrace this interplay of sex instinct and mystic aspirations , seeking expression in rhythmic movements of the body and gradually degenerating into a lascivious dance . And why ? Religion is prompted by dread of unfathomable death ; it always unites with a spiritual promise of happiness or solace the command to fight the forces of destruction by perpetuating life . " Be fruitful and multiply " is the supreme bidding of Nature . And , whenever necessary , all religions  | seem to have adopted ways of heightening that incentive to prolong life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul is supposed to dwell , but in a demand for the material , and to Nature more important , survival in the progeny of the flesh . Take the Hebrews leaving Egypt . Led by the wisdom and counsel of Moses , they succeeded in fording the Red Sea ; and the waves that closed in behind them not only shut them off from their pursuers , but seem to have cut them off from the rest of the world , for all eternity . When this handful of men and women , exhausted from the hardships of their exodus , were giving thanks to the Lord who saved them from slavery , Miriam , the sister of Moses , and all the women joined in a dance that must have fired the blood of those men , must have made them forget the dangers that lay behind them , the uncertainty they were facing , and must have whetted their appetite for life , the everlasting hunger of the race to eternize itself in its children , a hunger that nobody needed more than that isolated lot of Jews @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ related in the Old Testament , though it is the first and by far the most significant . Although we have many pictorial records of dances as practised in the early days of Grecian civilization , on mural friezes , in Tanagra statuettes , and especially on vases , we have no clear idea concerning the famous mysteries of Eleusis . It was a religious ceremonial in honour of Ceres ? goddess of fertility ? lasted for nine days , included various processions and dances , and culminated in an awe-inspiring rite , which undoubtedly aimed to arouse the two dominant desires of man , for the immortality of soul and of body . The festivities and dances held in honour of Bacchus unquestionably turned into orgies . The Feast of Apollo , the Feast of Oxen , the Feast of the Earth , the Triumph of Pallas over Neptune , and countless others were celebrated with dancing . Every family event , every public function of a religious nature , was an occasion for exhibitions of the dance . There were dances which , according to Plato , had that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the expression of the sentiments with which a mortal should be permeated when he invokes the gods .  | There was one dance , the Endymatia , which called for brilliant trappings , was performed in public and in private , and ? we are told ? " sometimes lost its sacred character . " The Hormos , dedicated to Diana , was danced by youths of both sexes , unclothed , but their movements , as became the cult of the chaste huntress , gave no offence to modesty , their attitudes were purely intended to show to their fairest advantage the beautiful lines of perfect human bodies , warmed by the radiant skies of Hellas . These dances were instituted by Lycurgus , the great Spartan legislator . Plutarch tells us that when Lycurgus was reproached for the nudity of the women , he answered : " I wish them to perform the same exercises as men , that they may equal men in strength , health , virtue , and generosity of soul , and that they may learn to despise the opinion of the vulgar . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one quite repress a feeling that behind the wish of Lycurgus there was the will of Nature . Since time immemorial funerals were made occasions for dances . In Greece the body was carried to the pyre , preceded by a dancing priest , accompanied by dancing relatives and friends , mourned by hired wailing women who simulated grief and tears . Not only in antiquity , throughout the Middle Ages we encounter funeral dances , meet with turning pairs in cemeteries , find the mourners carousing at the wake . And here again it seems that the presence of death releases in man subconsciously the impulse for preservation and continuation , which is the very foil of death . A civil engineer belonging to the Suez Canal Commission , who visited the Nile countries in 1855 , described a funeral at Derr , the capital of Nubia : The son of the Cadi had just died . We arrived three hours after his death , at the moment he was about to be buried . The population had assembled , the men on one side , smoking their tshibouks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crouching on the ground , dressed in their best . They began by washing the corpse ; then it was placed in a shroud and covered with a burial cloth , which is of a reddish colour . During this time , the tarabouk re-  | sounded , accompanying dances which were executed by the women . Here , too , by the open grave , that curious appeal to the senses of life ! The Romans had their sacred dances , as had the Greeks . Even to the meagre beginnings of their great epoch we can trace religious ceremonies in which dancing had its part . King Numa Pompilius founded the order of Salian priests , whose duty it was to honour the gods with dances . But in Rome , more quickly than in Greece , these performances lost their pure and modest character , and dancing in general tended to gratify an increasing demand for pleasure and obscenity . The history of Rome offers abundant proof that dancing degenerates whenever the vital forces of a race need replenishing . For corroborative evidence we need not look only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year 364 after its foundation , when the city was ravaged by pestilence , this reaction set in with a desperate abandonment to dancing , approved and recommended by divine oracles . Ancient Rome was not devoid of prudes who condemned dancing as frivolous and wished it confined to professional performers . That was in the days of supremacy and health . When the cancer of Oriental mollification and megalomaniac expansion began to destroy the nerves of the Empire , weakened by the drain of incessant war , the dance took its place at the head of all diversions . Ammianus Marcellinus relates of the imperial days that once , when a famine was raging , all foreign philosophers , orators , and teachers were ordered to leave the city , while three thousand foreign dancing girls 1 were permitted to remain . But not even they could stay 1 The dancing girls from Gades ( Cadiz ) were especially famous , and , according to Martial 's testimony , their peculiar prowess was such that it is easily perceived why no Roman " Midnight Frolic " was complete without them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lascivos docili tremore Jumbos . Lib . V , epigr. lxxix.  | the fall of Roman dominion on earth , nor of the Roman gods above . The Moslem and Hindu religions are unthinkable without their preponderance of dancing . And these dances , especially , are apt to take on a libidinous character . For are we not here in the countries of perpetual floods and famine , in the very lair of the Plague ? The sacred dancers of India , the Ramdjeniy , sway in undulating rhythm over the floor of polished marble ; their arms seem to stretch toward the far-off , invisible god in a gesture of desire . The air is rich with the scent of crushed blossoms ; the weird sound of incantations , accompanied by strange instruments , re-echoes from the dimly lighted temple walls on which the gods are represented in appalling hideousness or monstrosity . Rousselet , in his book " L'Inde des Rajahs , " speaks of the festival of " Holi , " in honour of the goddess of spring , as " feasts of frenzied debauch , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cult . The dancing girls have for these holidays particular dances , in which all decency is disregarded . " Mohammedanism has its dancing Dervishes . The founder of the sect is said to have turned round his axis for forty days without stopping , to the sound of a flute , to be rewarded at the end of the fortieth day , when he dropped unconscious to the ground , by what we are told was divine ecstasy . What an inhuman price to pay for even so rare a pleasure ! In Algeria we find a religious sect the horrible rites of which call to mind the orgiastic furor of the Bacchantes , those dancing priestesses who in Greece and Rome brought licentiousness to a degree that taxes even modern imagination . In an atmosphere saturated with incense , to a music that becomes more and more strident and vertiginous , these Algerians gyrate until they fall senseless to the floor , when they add to the barbarism of their performance by self-torture and self-mutilation . This strange combination of the religious and sex-complex is here taking on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And masuenism is at the bottom of that peculiar religious mania of the " flagellants " who at various times , during  | the Middle Ages , moved in ghastly processions through the countries of Europe . First organized in 1056 , vainly prohibited by the authorities , these large congregations of men , girded with ropes , marched through the streets of one city after another , to the rhythmic cadence of lugubrious chants , and with ecstatic gestures scourged their naked breasts and shoulders , until the blood was dripping in the mire of the road . Italy , Austria , Hungary , and Poland resounded with their agonized psalmody . They existed in southern France , under the name of " blancs battus , " down to the reign of Henry III . That jaded and weary monarch first encountered these processions when on a visit to Avignon . He was so fascinated by what the old chronicler terms " ces comedies indecentes " that he decided to prolong his stay in the city . Finally he became himself a convert to these sanguinary excesses , introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the court , with the Duchess of Montpensier at their head , paraded through the town in scant attire and wielding murderous scourges in their hands , but doing themselves little harm , beyond an unnecessary exposure to the dangers of catching cold . It is a far cry from those ambulatory orgies of religious maniacs to the gay farandoles of the Provencals , yet the echo is clear and unmistakable . They are nocturnal dance-processions , made more mysterious by the flaming torches that leave a trail of heavy smoke to mingle with the dust , stirred up by stamping feet ; and smoke and dust ? before they slowly settle in the distance ? have covered with their double veil the chain of agitated couples , whose whispered pledges and confessions are drowned by the strident galoubet and the relentless tambourin . Long before the Middle Ages the dance had found a place in Christian worship . Tertullian , who embraced Christianity about the year 190 , is our main authority for the fact that the first Christians , persecuted and always in the shadow of martyrdom , danced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was never quite abolished until it had degenerated and had lost its religious character , so that the bishops had to prohibit it .  | Father Menestrier , who in 1682 published a most interesting book on the dances of antiquity and of his day , wrote : I myself have seen the canons take the choir boys by the hand in some churches on Easter day , and dance in the church , singing hymns of thanksgiving , to say nothing of the scandalous customs , introduced by the simplicity of past centuries , but so corrupted by libertinism that not only have severe laws been necessary for their suppression , but much care and zeal on the part of our prelates to banish these dangerous abuses from their dioceses . In the Cathedral of Seville , to this day , the choir boys perform their historic dance , dressed in quaint costumes of the time when their privilege was sanctioned by a Bull of Pope Eugenius IV , in 1439.1 Within the last century the " Holy Rollers " in America , and the " Jumpers " in Australia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chief part of their religious worship ( owing perhaps again to conditions similar to those which the Jews had to face after crossing the Red Sea ) . Nevertheless , there is no dancing in our present churches . Nor does Nature require it of the church . For that edifice has lost the significance it possessed up to the late Middle Ages , when it stood for the great civic centre of the community . Michelet calls the mediaeval church " ce domaine du peuple . " It is no longer so . From the church the dance in its " acutest " form has long since migrated to what later Footnote  | became the true domain of the people ? namely , the theatre and the public dance-hall . But before we turn to these places , let us briefly review the second and least interesting type of dances , those of a warlike character . These exhibitions , which I have ascribed to a desire to intimidate an enemy or incite " une belle fureur " in the dancers , were very popular in ancient times and are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red races . Greek youths , before going into battle , or to commemorate a day of victory , put on their armour and performed a dance which developed into a simulated combat . We find the same thing later on in Rome . Something of this spirit survived in the tournaments and pageantry of knighthood , and , reduced to more prosaic but perhaps as efficacious a practice , we see it in the exercises and drills to which our present generation of strenuous and neurotic business men submit at the gymnasium . It is the prototype of all athletic sport . But what might still be called a " war-dance " was known as recently as in the days of Napoleon I , whose " Grognards " are pictured in a coloured lithograph of the period as hopping round much after the fashion of the Sioux or Chippewas , with an attentive audience of other warriors yelling encouragement to the least graceful of Terpsichorean artists . You may ask why our boys and the " tommies " and poilus did not seem to need that sort of exhilaration before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they needed and received similar exhilaration , but more in the form of relaxation than as an incentive to greater ardour . And that is probably due to the fact that the character of warfare has so much changed . Armies no longer meet on the battlefield by special arrangement and personal invitation of the generals . The note of chivalrous competition has vanished . It is a matter of cunning , of brutality , or surprise and fiendish engines . Yet the horrors of carnage made , on the eve of battle , the call of passion and the dance for pleasure 's sake only the more irresistible . There remains the third and last group of dances , those frankly intended for entertainment only , of purely profane character , a social diversion , and as such reflecting sharply the soale-  | ties of different epochs and climates . The degree of licentiousness exhibited in profane dances , throughout the ages , varies according to the economic situation and the political fortunes of the times . The more desperate the aspect of either , the lower the level of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be the straighter course to single out the periods of greater hardship and mortality , and to show how they affected dancing . I have mentioned the visitation of Rome by the pest , in 364 , and its consequences . There exist striking analogies between these consequences and the conditions that attended the first appearance of Asiatic cholera in the countries of Europe , in 1349 . " The Black Death " ? as the malady was then called ? had begun to sweep westward out of China ; wider and ever wider became its devastation ; no precautions , no remedies seemed to stay its murderous progress . News travelled slowly in those days , and the tales of horror had hardly time to precede the fearful visitant himself . Hygiene was unknown . Superstition reigned everywhere . As village after village , town after town , fell a prey to this pestilence , the people of Europe were seized with terror and religious hysteria . The water of the well , the fruit on the tree , the air itself seemed poisoned . The rich and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Angel . " By the time the epidemic had reached Germany , the populace was dying by the millions . The dead could not be buried fast enough . The horrors beggared description . The " Last Judgment " seemed at hand , and the wrath of God ready to exterminate the human race . In the passiveness of their despair , people gave up all efforts to resist this plague , and thereby naturally augmented the danger . At the point of deepest , direst misery , what is it that suddenly kindles the expiring flame of life , whips the flagging forces of humanity into a ghastly but magnificent assertion of their will to live ? It is the dance , the fury of dancing ! Unbelievable scenes occurred , as recounted by an eyewitness in the famous " Limburg Chronicle . " This is , in part , the story : Anno 1374 , in the middle of summer , there was a strange thing  | to be seen on Earth , particularly in Teuton Lands , along the Rhine and the Moselle , namely that people began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one place for half a day , and danced until they fell to the ground . Thereby they expected to be cured , and went from one town to another , and they collected money . And matters became so bad that in Cologne more than 500 people were found dancing . And it was declared a heresy , as it was done for money , and as many men and women were led by it into immoral intercourse . For in Cologne alone more than a hundred women and girls were found with men not their husbands . All of these women were with child as a result of these dances . And here again , as so often in history , we see the Church foolishly and vainly trying to step into the path of Nature , by combating the very means that Life is forced to adopt in an heroic effort to stem the overwhelming tide of Death . But the religious authorities are not alone in their blindness to the causes and effects of those extraordinary conditions . The historians , too , feel compelled blushingly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his " Histoire de la danse a travers les ages , " apropos of the French guild of " menestriers , " those wandering musicians and dissolute dancers , is typical of this common error : " Ces fetes continuerent malgre les guerres , les pestes et autres calamites . " Note the " malgre , " which should properly be replaced by an " a cause de " ; for the more wars , the more pestilence and calamities on earth ? in other words , the larger the death rate ? the gayer , the more universal and licentious must be the dance ! Nor is it only in the public square , in the village tavern , that in such circumstances all bounds of modesty are broken . Death , the equalizer ? portrayed by Holbein and other medieval artists in a dance with " rich man , poor man , beggar man , thief ; doctor , lawyer , merchant , chief " ? Death enters the moated castle as unceremoniously as the wind-torn hovel . And the reaction remains the same ; for , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of hilarious and unbridled entertainments , ending in " un dernier bal en fin , mais celui-ci masque , pour dispenser de rougir. "  | When the dance became one of the community 's secular concerns , each national temperament found expression in a typical folk-dance , as distinctive as national speech and costume . But whether it be the Spanish or Italian " gagliarda , " called by Praetorius ( in 1668 ) an " invention of Hell , " or the Tyrolian " Schuh-plattler " in which it is the dancer 's aim to swing his partner high into the air so that her petticoat blows up a snowy bell ; whether the fiery " mazurka " of Poland , or the Hungarian gypsies ' " czardas " with its ominous , slow beginning and its cyclonic finale ; the old English " trenchmore " and " cushiondance , " that ingenious excuse for promiscuous osculation , ) or the Bohemian " umrlec " ( death dance ) in which a man or woman " plays dead " and lies on the floor , with eyes closed , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the company , which blithely turns round the " corpse " ? everywhere , in the south , east , north and west of Europe , folk-dances are nothing else than a form of public courting or amorous frolicking ; and the more daring the wooer , the better pleased the damsel . What these popular romps were like during the religious wars of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries , when Death was reaping a bumper crop , can hardly be put in seemly wording . We must read Florian von Fiirstenberg 's denunciation in his " Tanzteufel ( Dance Devil ) , " of 1567 , or Cyriacus Spangenberg 's " Ehespiegel ( Marriage Mirror ) , " of 1570 , in order to grasp the wicked , untrimmed truth . While the mercenaries of the Catholic and Protestant rulers were decimating each other , not for a paltry " thirty years ' war , " but for Footnote  | more than fifteen decades , there was hardly a town in Germany in the annals of which we do not find , for this period , some wellmeaning . finance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regions were known for their particular celebrations , in which dancing predominated . All these occasions seem to fall in , more or less , with the phases of nature , which bear the strongest influence upon the effect that seeks an outlet through , or is stimulated by , such rhythmic leaps and bounds . Almost every race indulged in solstice-dances , at the time when the rhythm of the universe seems to change , as flux and reflux alternate , when a certain mysterious agitation is animating nature , and the seasons make another step in their eternal round . Mezeray , in his contemporary " Histoire de la France , " relates that in the reign of Charles V , on St. John 's day : " people divested themselves of all their garments , placed flower-wreaths on their heads , and , holding each other by the hand , they danced in long processions through the streets and churches , sang and whirled round until they dropped , out of breath . " It is always the same picture , in different colours , throughout the ages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in 1667 . We are left in no doubt about social dances in Italy during the sixteenth century , owing to several exhaustive treatises of the period . There is , in particular , Fabrizio Caroso 's dance-book , " Ballarino , " published in 1581 , and dedicated to the beautiful and notorious Bianca Capello . There are Cesare Negri 's " Nuove inventioni di balli , " printed at Milan in 1604 , and disclosing the fact that , more poetic than our age with its " bunny hug , " " shimmy , " and allied atrocities , dances then had such pretty and significant names as caccia d'amore , cortesia amorosa , amor felice , nobilita d'amore , torneo amoroso ? " amorous tournaments " they verily were , one and all , fought not with " rockets , " but with armes a outrance . The ballet as a sumptuous spectacle , in the modern sense , was an invention of the quattrocento , and came spontaneously into existence . At least , its connection with an art not unknown among Greeks and Romans seems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mythological subject . In every other respect it was an absolutely novel thrill to which the world was being treated . Nor can we find any preliminary steps of development for it , unless we consider as such the singular entertainment devised by Bergonzo di Botta at the nuptials of Duke Galeazzo Sforza of Milan with Isabella of Aragon , in 1489 . Its first appearance set a standard which was seldom equalled in what , ever after , remained the costliest , the most dazzling and often criminally lavish display of riches and splendour . It was in 1581 , at the palace of the Louvre in Paris , that Henry III , King of France , late of Poland , l commanded the musicians and entertainers of his court to devise fitting festivities wherewith to celebrate the marriage of his " favourite minion , " Monsieur le Duc de Joyeuse , with Mlle. de Vaudemont , sister to the Queen , Louise of Lorraine . Seventeen separate functions took place , each host vying with the other in the folly of luxuries ; but the most stupendous remained the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with music by Lambert de Beaulieu and Jacques Salmon . At this wedding feast of royalty the princes and princesses of the houses of Valois and Anjou participated in a choreographic representation of an old Olympian myth , as gods and goddesses , with their attending nymphs and satyrs . Baltazarini says in the preface of the printed work that he had " blended together poetry , music , and dancing in a manner which , if ever done before , must have been in such remote antiquity that no trace of it remains . " And Footnote  | the author emphasizes the novelty of his invention by saying : " I have given the first place to dancing . . . " and he might have added , to the rhythmic evolutions of the human body , clad in a profusion of brocades or simply adorned with nature 's charms . For while some of the costumes cost as much as eighty thousand francs apiece , those participants whose roles provided a justification shone by the mere exquisite whiteness of their skin . And thus was born the ballet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nineteen years later , it remained for a long time the privileged entertainment of the noble and rich , and more particularly of the regal courts . Louis XIV danced in twenty-seven ballets when he was young , and received the cognomen " Le Roi Soleil " from the part he took in one of them . Although lively steps occurred in these ballets or were danced at balls , it is principally the stately measure that prevails in both . Louis was particularly fond of the courante . It must not be forgotten that the costume of the ladies and the swords worn by the cavaliers , precluded any helter-skelter mingling of pairs in an animated round . These conditions remained the same until the outbreak of the French Revolution , with the courante making room for the minuet under Louis XV , and the gavot becoming the " fashionable " dance under Louis XVI . Note that every one of these figure-dances , though capable of all the graces and gallantry imaginable , eighteenthcentury qualities never excelled , remained nevertheless a rather stiff and dignified affair , in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partners , a distance that a smile and a look might easily cross , but that was never abandoned for the sake of closer propinquity . Nor did the gallant century in France have to resort to such expedients . Although society , at last , was dancing on top of a volcano , the reigns of the fourteenth and the fifteenth Louis had been glorious and fairly prosperous . What wars had been waged did not demand too heavy a toll of lives . It was a period of stability ; and from the dream that nothing could disturb this equilibrium the country was awakened only when it found that in this blissful state of somnolent contentment the reins of government in Paris had slipped out of a soft and per-  | fumed hand , to be snapped up by the coarse and brutal fist of the rabble . The balance turned turtle , the change was almost instantaneous . In Vienna , the capital of the Roman Emperor of Teuton nationality , the change was more gradual . Not that his throne was threatened like that of his brother-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been entangled , especially under Maria Theresa , wars with Russia and Turkey , wars with Bavaria , with France and England , and especially the long and obstinate struggle with Frederick the Great of Prussia , had severely taxed the forces of the Empire and drained its sap . It was in Austria , and more particularly in Vienna , that at this point the waltz made its victorious entry into the world . The rigour of antiquated etiquette was broken , and with the more intimate embrace of the dancers , linked more closely by the sway of a bewitching rhythm , the waltz cast its imperious spell over a disintegrating society . Michael Kelly , the Irish tenor , who sang in Vienna from 1782 to 1786 , relates in his entertaining reminiscences : The people of Vienna were in my time dancing mad ; as the Carnival approached , gaiety began to display itself on all sides , and when it really came , nothing could exceed its brilliancy .. . the propensity of the Vienna ladies for dancing and going to carnival masquerades was so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyment of their favourite amusement . And Kelly goes on to state the incredible length to which they went in this pursuit . ? England , too , had succumbed to the dance craze , after a fashion . Dr. Burney tells us in his " History of Music " of conditions in London , which throw an interesting light on the favour in which the ballet was held at the end of the eighteenth century . Burney writes : In the year 1781 Pacchierotti the Caruso of his day had been heard so frequently , that his singing was no impediment to conversation , or even animated narrative and debate , but while the  | elder Vestris the Nijinsky of his day was on the stage , if during a pas seul any of his admirers forgot themselves so much as to applaud him with their hands , there was an instant check put to his rapture by a choral " hu-sh-sh ! " And in 1788 Burney writes : Within the last ten years , Dancing seems to have encroached upon Music , and instead of being a dependent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but tyranny . Remember that the learned and peeved doctor speaks only of the ballet , as danced on the stage . The calm , collected Briton , like the prudish Roman at the summit of his power , standing secure and aloof from the turmoil with which the rest of Europe was contending , could possibly tolerate , perhaps encourage and even rave over the graceful pirouettes of Vestris , " le dieu de la danse , " but for the looseness of custom at continental balls , and particularly in public dancing-halls , he had only a disdainful shrug of the shoulders . ) In i8o2 , when the peace of Amiens left Europe with a foretaste of General Bonaparte 's strategic and diplomatic talents , many Englishmen visited Paris through curiosity , and in search of cheap relics of the " ancien regime . " One of the most distinguished was the London banker and litterateur Sir John Dean Paul , who with his wife and three friends spent two weeks in the French capital , during the month of August , 18oz ; and the sights that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's diary , were those to be seen at the various dancing ' Yet London , in earlier and less glorious days , had known its " Mulberry Gardens " and " World 's End , " notorious places of intrigue and broad hilarity . Sir John Hawkins wrote that " there was an edifice built of timber and divided into sundry rooms with a platform and balustrade at top , which floated on the Thames above London Bridge , and was called the Folly . At first it was resorted to for refreshment by persons of fashion and Queen Mary with some of her courtiers had once the curiosity to visit it . But it sank into a receptacle for companies of loose and disorderly poeple , for the purposes of drinking and promiscuous dancing . " ? Vauxhall originated in the reign of Charles II . Its history , like that of Ranelagh , is redeemed by services to music proper which counterbalance the piquant story of its improprieties.  | places , such as Tivoli , Frascati , and the Pavillon d'Hannovre . Sir John was also something of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couples dancing the waltz at the Tivoli . His picture is probably several shades more modest than what he saw and what he describes as a dance that could never cross the Channel , wherefrom we may infer that the honourable city banker 's financial perspicacity must have surpassed his prophetic gifts as far as concerned the contagiousness of the waltz . But let us return to Paris in the hour of the crisis , and let us see when and why the waltz found there such fanatic devotees . The extravagance , the sublime indifference of court and aristocracy ; a national debt that had reached fabulous figures ; new dogmas proclaiming " the rights of man " and assaulting the timeworn tenets of social justice ; and finally the shot fired by those Massachusetts farmers at Lexington , re-echoing round the world with the sweet promise of independence ? all things combined , resulted in an overthrow of mildewed conceptions , creeds , and customs . After the storming of the Bastille , on July 14th , 1789 , events moved quickly . In a steady , breathless crescendo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis XVI , and the subsequent Reign of Terror . With Robespierre and his accomplices wielding absolute power , the knife of the guillotine had barely a chance to cool off from the blood of the numberless victims that the blind fury of the populace demanded . But the greater the slaughter , the wilder and more licentious the amusements of the people . And with the cast-off manners of aristocratic gallantry and chivalry , the " Fetes Galantes " that Watteau 's and Fragonard 's brush had immortalized became a thing of the past . The new spirit , which required so copious a baptism with the liquor of life , had to find ways and means of replenishing the wasted stock . It was at this juncture that the waltz appeared in Paris . The days of the Terror knew for the business of the night 23 theatres open in Paris , filled with laughing spectators , and 1800 public dancehalls , overflowing with crowds that sought a brief respite in the whirl of the dance , the insinuative lilt of the music , the lights from a hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the feast . Nature left nothing undone to make the lure resistless . Gone , by a stroke of magic , were hoopskirts , furbelows , powdered wigs , and laced corsages . Instead the women modelled their attire after that of Aspasia , with bare arms and breast , sandalled feet , and hair bound in plaits round their heads . Fashionable hairdressers arranged the curls of their customers with casts of classic busts before them . Undergarments were banished and replaced by a knitted silk vest which clung to the figure . In this attire the " belles " of the revolutionary epoch paraded the boulevards and went to the dance . But not only in the public places set apart for such amusements , or in private assemblies , did the populace turn in a surging eddy to the tune of the waltz . Mercier , in describing the conditions he saw , writes : Dancing is universal ; they dance at the Carmelites , between the massacres ; they dance at the Jesuits ' Seminary ; at the Convent of the Carmelites du Marais ; at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; they dance in three ruined churches of my section , and upon the stones of all the tombs which have not been destroyed . But the most amazing part of Mercier 's recital is his account of the " Bal des Victimes , " to which were admitted only the relatives of men and women murdered on the guillotine : Will posterity believe that people whose relations had died on the scaffold inaugurated , not days of solemn general grief , when , assembled in mourning garb , they might bear witness to their sorrow at the cruel losses so recently sustained , but days of dancing , drinking , and feasting . For admission to one of these banquets and dances it is necessary to show a certificate of the loss of a father , mother , husband , wife , brother , or sister under the knife of the guillotine . The death of collaterals does not confer the right of attending the fete . And thus Nature , in her cryptic ways of wisdom , destroys ,  | and immediately proceeds to repair , even in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ France more than ever . What the blood-thirst of the terrorists had left undone , the campaigns of Napoleon accomplished . The dance went on , always giddier , always more licentious . The waltz , once known in France as " la volte , " an inoffensive pastime of peasants , then forgotten and reimported from Vienna , was finally legitimized by its introduction on the stage of the Opera , in r800 , in a ballet by Gardel , famous choreographer in his day , with music by Maul , and very neatly named " La Dansomanie . " What this mania for dancing finally came to can be judged best by the rigour and ingenuity which were required in order to fight it . The Church sent out missions to preach against these abuses . Thirty missionaries who visited the province of Bourgogne during the carnival of 18r9 , having forbidden all dances and profane entertainments , had a chorus of young maidens sing a long chant to the tune of a then famous aria ; two stanzas will suffice to give a taste of this austere sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pudeur , Funeste ecueil de l'innocence , Le Demon seul est ton auteur , Funeste danse . Qu'une danseuse Vous soit un sujet de frayeur ; Craignez son air , sa voix flatteuse . Qui surprend mieux les yeux , le cceur , Qu'une danseusel These observations suggest inevitably a parallel between the Footnote  | dancing-craze of 1819 and that of 1919 . The capitals of Europe , the whole of the United States , after having endured the greatest hardships and anxieties within the memory of man , were dancing , were furiously and indecently dancing . The middle of the nineteenth century enjoyed innocuous lancers , quadrilles , polkas , and expurgated waltzes . In France , where the birth rate was beginning to decline , we meet before the outbreak of the Franco-Prussian War with the " cancan , " the only dance of the period that was pointedly obscene . The interest in social dancing had become perfunctory ; the ballet had turned a barren harlequinade with an abundance of pink tights , white tulle skirts , and fairy tricks destined to gladden the nursery . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intermezzo " with a world that is merrily dancing its heels and heads off , dancing , perhaps , toward the brink of ruin . So danced Babylon , Nineveh , Byzantium , and Rome ? names that stand for vanished civilizations . Must we seek the race that is to rule to-morrow in that one which is still without public dance-halls , " Palais de Danse , " for its fretting children , whom Nature is struggling to preserve against all odds ? It is a most absorbing , a most appalling perspective which opens to the gaze that follows the dance , throughout the centuries , from a distant antiquity down to our days . Emerson wrote in his journal of 1822 : " Owing to the identity of human character in all ages , there is as much instruction in the tale of Troy as in the annals of the French Revolution . " Were Emerson living to-day , the French Revolution might have served him for comparison with existing disturbances . And so we see , reaching backward and projecting forward , a vague outline of recurring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forever a similarity of causes and effects , a periodicity of movement , which , spread over thousands and perhaps millions of years , is nothing but the manifestation of that rhythmic law which the incomprehensible stars obey , as does that equally incomprehensible thing , the heart of man , leaping immemorially , with quickened pulses , to the seductive measures of the dance .  | ( Read before the Music Supervisors ' National Conference in Nashville , Tennessee , March , 1922 ) All is upon us , everywhere . To deny the fact is to assume the classic ostrich pose , head buried in the sand , tailfeathers to the sun . To shout alarm hysterically from the housetops , is to exhibit over-confidence in clamorous indignation as a purifier of morals , if it be not wholly to ignore historic precedent . Let us remember that the worst of our present dances are not beginning to approach in barefaced wickedness the almost unbelievable performances of our forefathers . And let us admit that the best of jazz tunes is something infinitely more original ? perhaps even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that America produced in the " good old days , " that golden age which lives only in the mythology of disappointed sinners . Almost every race and every age have known social conditions which result in an unloosing of instincts that nature wisely has taught us to hold well in check , but which , every now and then , from cryptic reasons , are allowed to break the bounds of civilized restraint . Such excesses have not infrequently attained to tragic madness . The silly , lewd gyrations for which jazz is held responsible by some are the release of tension in a witless , neurotic stratum of society . But such dances were common long before the word " jazz " was coined . Our recent dance craze has known the tango , the " shimmy , " the various zoological trots , to much the same purpose that now cries out for jazz . Whoever wishes to reform the dance must break the grip that  | clutches partner against partner , in shuffling , wriggling ambulation . Abolish the comparative intimacy of that twofold company ; make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd ; devise a dance in which there is general participation , as there was in the quadrille , the figure-dances , the milder forms of country reels , and you not only will improve the tone of public amusements , but possibly may open a way for dance-music to resume a swifter , ampler , and more sweeping gait , instead of the repeated , jogging , stubborn motives which lead to stupid , short , reiterated movements . For the present I am not concerned with dance reform , nor am I interested in jazz as an accompaniment to Terpsichorean atrocities , but rather in the musical side of jazz ? how it originated , what it represents , and what it may lead to . To a great many minds , the word " jazz " implies frivolous or obscene deportment . Let me ask what the word " sarabande " suggests to you ? I have no doubt that to most people it will mean everything that is diametrically opposed to " jazzing . " When you hear mention of a " sarabande , " you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airs ; you think of noble and dignified strains in partitas , sonatas , and operas of the eighteenth century . Yet the sarabande when it was first danced in Spain , about 1588 , was probably far more shocking to behold than is the most shocking jazz to-day . The sarabande seems to have been of Moorish origin . Then , as now , the Oriental , the exotic touch gave dancing an added fillip . When Lady Mary Montagu , writing from Adrianople in 1717 , described the dance that she saw in the seraglio of a rich Mussulman , she made allusions which leave no uncertainty as to the exact nature of these proceedings . Something of that character must have belonged to the earliest sarabandes . They were the proud Hidalgo 's hula-hula . A French author , Pierre de Lancre , wrote in 1613 : " The  | courtesans who mingle with the players have given this dance such a vogue on the stage that there is hardly a young girl in the country who can not copy them to perfection . " How truly the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the stage that starts a novel mode of dancing , the public which is alert to ape it and outstep it . Father Mariana , in his book " De Spectaculis , " published in 1609 , devoted a whole chapter to an attack on the sarabande , accusing it of having done more harm than the bubonic plague which devastated Europe in the Middle Ages . Again , we hear it alleged that the moral corruption worked by jazz is vastly more calamitous than was the material havoc wrought by the World War . And yet , as we know , this once objectionable sarabande finally became a matrix wherein the greatest musical composers cast some of their loftiest and purest inspirations . Dances , popular and no doubt shocking in their day , have furnished the soil for the cyclic growth from which has sprung , by way of the concerto and sonata , the grandest form of absolute music , the orchestral symphony . What the waltz was when first it set Vienna spinning , when it turned Paris into one big whirlpool , has been variously chronicled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more perturbed than the impious poet Lord Byron . Not soft Herodias , when , with winning tread , Her nimble feet danced off another 's head ; Not Cleopatra on her galley 's deck Displayed so much of leg or more of neck , Than thou , ambrosial Waltz . Yet Weber was to vest such bareness in the spacious mantle of his art , and Chopin crown it with the coronet of quality . I have taken the licence of rapidly rehearsing these few historical facts to answer those who might question my saneness in bestowing upon the musical side of jazz so much as a particle of studious thought . Without speculating what the future development of jazz may be , what ultimate contribution to musical styles  | it may make , there is an excuse for believing that long after the dance known as jazz will happily have vanished , investigators in the field of musical history will have occasion to search for the inception of these peculiar tunes , to seek for traces of contemporary opinion on their merit or their faults . I frankly think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if those investigators were to discover no sign of unbiased appraisement , nothing but wholesale ranting against a laxity of morals which was inveterate before the frenzied beaters of pots and kitchen kettles became entitled to full membership in the Musical Union . Let me emphatically state that I in no way sympathize with these perpetrators of infernal din , who are giving a poor imitation of the admirable savage , with his highly perfected and astonishingly diversified art of sounding pulsatile instruments . The savage stands far above the clownish tricks of rubbing sandpaper , blowing shrieky sirens , or hitting at random a battery of gongs . The savage is immeasurably more cultured than the person who belabours a piano with his whole body and , thrumming two or three ill-assorted chords , frantically fumbled together in endless and stale repetition , tries to tell you that he is playing jazz . As a matter of fact , he is doing nothing of the kind . Like any other type of music , jazz can be bad or good . I am not defending bad jazz any more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Beethoven . I have no intention of standing up for the insolent plagiarists who misappropriate and disfigure Rimsky-Korsakov , Puccini , and that superlative master Johann Strauss . I am certain that the apostle of vulgarization who should try to rewrite Shelley 's poems in slang would be broken on the wheel and quartered . And I should be delighted to help set up the punitive machinery if musical barbarians were to be similarly executed . So much , then , to clear the stage , and range into a solid background these protests and restrictions , upon which I shall ask you to fix , from time to time , a reassuring glance , while I step to the proscenium and speak my little piece . The burden of it is this : there exists such a thing as good jazz music , and good jazz  | is a great deal better , and far more harmless , than is a bad ballad or the bad playing of Beethoven . And , if you are open-eyed in surveying our musical tendencies , you can not pass blindly over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Smile " songs ; " Bubble " songs ; " Mother , " " Mither , " and " Mammy " songs ; the sloppy " Sweetheart " drivel ; above all , the unpardonable maltreatment of the classics by the multitude of amateurs ? offences infinitely worse than good jazz . And to the latter I now come . Jazz as a state of mind is symptom , not malady . Jazz in the guise of music is both anodyne and stimulant to the afflicted . To the immune it is an irritant . The term " jazz " as applied to music is rather elastic . It embraces not only the noisy-noisome sort , the jumble-jungle kind , but a type that refines upon and meliorates the racy stuff of wilder species with matter of a distinctly and engagingly musical nature . Good jazz is a composite , the happy union of seemingly incompatible elements . Good jazz is the latest phase of American popular music . It is the upshot of a transformation which started some twenty years ago and culminated in something unique , unmatched in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had progressed to the insipid " Waltz me around again , Willie , " to the coon-song and rag-time factories in the back parlours of the West Twentieth streets of New York . With the period of " Everybody 's doing it , doing it , doing it , " about 1912 , we reached the short insistent motive which was to usurp the prerogatives of songfulness . Then , one fine day , in 1915 ? or fine night , I should rather say ; for , if I remember correctly , it was in the second act of a mildly entertaining operetta ? we were treated to " The Magic Melody . " A young man , gifted with musical talent and unusual courage , had dared to introduce into his tune a modulation which was nothing extraordinary in itself , but which marked a change , a new regime in American popular music . It was just the thing  | that the popular composer in the making had been warned against by the wise ones as a thing too " high-brow " for the public to accept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked it ; they went mad over it . And well they might ; for it was a relief , a liberation . Gradually the courageous young man found imitators more daring than himself . Harmonic richness and variety entered victoriously where stereotyped cadences , barren and threadbare progressions , had reigned ad nauseam . Mind you , I am not setting milestones with the tunes I have named ; I merely wish to suggest to you different stages of a continuous evolution , by songs which were typical of each . I have not given the subject sufficient study to say definitely at what point the course of popular American music took a new turn , but , unless I am very much mistaken , " The Magic Melody , " by Mr. Jerome Kern , was the opening chorus of an epoch . It is not a composition of genius , but it is very ingenious . While it is almost more tuneless than was " Everybody 's doing it , " if that be possible , and largely adheres to the short , insistent phrase , it stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to immortality is that it introduces a modulation which , at the time it was first heard by the masses , seized their ears with the power of magic . And the masses , as usual , showed excellent judgment . Mr. Kern subsequently proved to be one of the most fertile , tasteful , and characteristic composers of light music . When he tries to be purely melodic , he is apt to fall back upon plain sentimentalism , tinged with spurious folk-song colour . But his little harmonic device had a hue all its own ; and popular parlance decided that it was " blue . " A veil of mystery covers the first dark deed that went by the name of " blue . " Forever hidden , perhaps , is the identity of the melancholic culprit who perpetrated it , although stout hearts are ready to cite the man , the place , and the tune . They are not apt , however , to tell you of an ancestral and bona-fide " blue chord , " which Richard Wagner deliberately chose in order  | to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning of Tristan and Isolde , refers to the green , but distant , shore as shimmering still in a blue haze . That is the sublime instance . The ridiculous one is the maudlin glissando on ukulele and steel guitar , the tear-duct of popular music . What stainless ears considered a rather weird turn of the melody , a morbid shifting of harmonies , entered the dictionary of professional jargon as " blue note , " or " blue chord . " I am under the impression that these terms were contemporary with , if they did not precede and foreshadow , the period of our innumerable musical " blues . " What the uninitiated tried to define by that homely appellation was , perhaps , an indistinct association of the minor mode and dyspeptic intonation with poor digestion ; in reality , it is the advent in popular music of something which the text-books call ambiguous chords , altered notes , extraneous modulation , and deceptive cadence . The trick had irresistible charm ; everybody tried it . It was in the preludes and interludes of the popular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order ? that is , in those measures where the voice did not interfere with their freedom . The hackneyed " Till ready " was mercifully dispatched to limbo , and superseded by some dexterous harmonic tricks that not only stood , but demanded and deserved , rehearing . Instead of the traditional sequence of dominant , diminished-seventh , and dominant-seventh harmonies ? which formed the time-worn transition into the refrain and accompanied the chanted announcement : " When he to her did say " ? there sprang up a diversity of the freshest , most unexpected modulations , which fell upon the ear like drops of evening rain upon a parched and sun-baked soil . The various shades of blue in which untutored harmonists indulged ranged all the way from faint cerulean to deep indigo . The last could often be more fittingly compared to mud . Between the earlier " rag " and the " blues , " there was this distinction : the rag had been mainly a thing of rhythm , of syncopation ; the blues were syncopation relished with spicier harmonies .  | In addition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the people ? who in the beginning had known but one thing : melody , fastened upon a primitive and weak harmonic structure of " barber-shop " chords ? the people , I say , who had stepwise advanced from melody and rhythm to harmony , lastly discovered counterpoint . And the result of this last discovery is jazz . In other words , jazz is rag-time , plus " blues , " plus orchestral polyphony ; it is the combination , in the popular music current , of melody , rhythm , harmony , and counterpoint . Each of these four ingredients bears racial features which are unequivocally American . Yet this Americanism is not exclusively a tribal one ; it is not content to borrow from the Negro , to filch from the Indian . What marks of Oriental inflections it shows hail from the Jordan rather than from the Congo River . While the primitive syncopation was taken over from the coloured man , while the Semitic purveyors of Broadway " hits " made us an invaluable gift of their more luxurious harmonic sense , the contrapuntal complexity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ complex , strident present-day American life . Where did you hear , before jazz was invented , such multifarious stirring , heaving , wrestling of independent voices as there are in a jazz orchestra ? The saxophone bleats a turgid song ; the clarinets turn capers of their own ; the violins come forward with an obbligato ; a saucy flute darts up and down the scale , never missing the right note on the right chord ; the trombone lumberingly slides off on a tangent ; the drum and xylophone put rhythmic high-lights into these kaleidoscopic shiftings ; the cornet is suddenly heard above the turmoil , with good-natured brazenness . Chaos in order ? orchestral technic of master craftsmen ? music that is recklessly fantastic , joyously grotesque ? such is good jazz . A superb , incomparable creation , inescapable yet elusive ; something it is almost impossible to put in score upon a page of paper .  | For jazz finds its last and supreme glory in the skill for improvisation exhibited by the performers . The deliberately scored jazz tunes are generally clumsy , pedestrian . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foresee the unexpected , to plan the improbable . Jazz is abandon , is whimsicality in music . A good jazz band should never , and actually never does , play the same piece twice in the same manner . Each player must be a clever musician , an originator as well as an interpreter , a wheel that turns hither and thither on its own axis without disturbing the clockwork . Strange to relate , this orchestral improvisation , which may seem virtually impossible or artistically undesirable , is not an invention of our age . To improvise counterpoint was a talent that the musicians in the orchestras of Peri and Monteverdi , three hundred years ago , were expected to possess , and did possess , to such a high degree that the skeleton scores of those operas which have come down to us give but an imperfect idea of how this music sounded when performed . A semblance of this lost , and rediscovered , art is contained in the music of the Russian and Hungarian gypsies . Just as that music is a riotous improvisation , throbbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so is jazz . Just as the gypsy players are held together by an identical , inexplicable rhythmic spell , following the leader 's fiddle in its harmonic meanderings , each instrument walking in a bypath of its own , so is the ideal jazz band constituted ? that is , the jazz band made up of serious jazz artists . Franz Liszt could give a suggestion of gypsy music on the keyboard . He had a way of playing the piano orchestrally . There are few people who can play jazz on the piano . Jazz , as much as the gypsy dances , depends on the many and contrasting voices of a band , united in a single and spontaneous rhythmic , harmonic , and contrapuntal will . Jazz , fortunately , can be preserved on phonographic records for our descendants . They will form their own estimate of our enormities . If we had such records of what Scarlatti , Couperin ,  | and Rameau did with their figured bases , we should need fewer realizations , restitutions , and renditions by arranger and deranger . Jazz is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern American spirit than all our coon-songs , our pseudo-Indian wails , the regional songs of a hundred years ago , the tenth-rate imitations of stale English ballads , the imperfect echoes of French impressionism . Good jazz is enjoyed by capital musicians , by men who are neither inordinately immoral nor extravagantly uncultured . It has fascinated European composers like Stravinsky , Casella , Satie , as Debussy was fascinated before them by ragtime . " Golliwog 's Cakewalk " and " Minstrels " are works of the purest art , notwithstanding the fact that the essence of their peculiar charm was filtered from the emanations of the music-hall . If jazz music has any of the gypsy music 's fitness for survival , it will leave a trace , unsoiled by memories of indecorum and police raids . Meanwhile the curious and heretical inquirer may be pardoned for dwelling reflectively upon so odd a case as that presented by the gradual accession of melody , rhythm , harmony , and counterpoint to the leading role in the popular music of America , a process covering barely more than five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless we take musical progress as a whole during the last five centuries . Good jazz , once brought into the focus of unclouded criticism , reveals , aside from the grosser features visible to a naked eye in the dark , some finer lineaments , which make it appear justly entitled to the benefit of honest doubt , based ? if on nothing else ? on the examples of the sarabande and the waltz . Of course , someone may interpose that we can not drive jazz , waltz , and sarabande in one and the same harness ; that the musical vehicles of 1922 are as different from those of 1822 , or 1722 , as is a snorting eight-cylinder automobile from a featherweight Tilbury or a pompous state-coach drawn by six .  | Quite true . Yet some argumentative and jazz-loving person may come along and retort that , while the means and speed of locomotion have changed , human nature has remained stationary , or , at least , much as it always was and will be . Said person might add to our embarrassment by averring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Handels , Webers , Chopins . And how shall we prove him wrong ?  | BEETHOVEN 'S MYSTERIOUS MALADY CENTENARY is always an ubiquitous temptation to indulge in rhapsody at the expense of veracity . " Thus writes Mr. Ernest Newman on the first page of his book " The Unconscious Beethoven . " And forthwith he yields to another temptation : he celebrates the event by over-indulging his fantasy in the absence of certainty . But he does it with such apparent belief in his own candour , with so great a show of anxiety about " the truth , " that no one will question the motives that prompted the recounting of the whole unvarnished tale , told with Mr. Newman 's usual dialectic skill . The only thing that might be questioned is whether the centennial air , heavy with rose and laurel , had after all been noticeably cleared by the addition of the doubtful fragrance from Mr. Newman 's bouquet of hints and guesses . Mr. Newman calls his book " an essay in musical psychology . " True to the technique of some of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newman 's procedure , in the main , is that of the little boy who delights in playing with mud . Mr. Newman declaims against " the romantic and sentimental rubbish " which has a way of accumulating about the figures of great men " during the course of a century or so . " In the name of " historical criticism " all dirt of this sort must be removed , even if nothing else will do but to substitute for it dirt of another and possibly more unpleasant kind . It would be indelicate to suggest that anything Mr. Newman writes could be likened to rubbish . He is too frequently original as a thinker , too uniformly brilliant as a writer . If Mr. Newman 's is an illuminating book , it throws more light on the author than on the author 's subject . The book is bare of any facts concerning Beethoven not known before ; it merely spins  | out and twists up certain theories long held as plausible , without adducing a single scrap of new evidence or positive proof wherewith to substantiate or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newman 's object is " to dig out the real Beethoven from the romantic plaster-of-Paris in which he has gradually become encased . " The excavation carries a long way forward what the author began in his study of Wagner , the man and the artist . In both cases he has shown himself particularly interested in the man ; and for reasons . If the man and the artist are far from the same , they are inseparable . However , the man with his failings is always humanly nearer to the rest of us than is the artist in his ivory tower or barbed-wire stockade . The man we can possibly measure by the yardstick of our own troubled existence , whereas the artist remains to most of us an elusive or incomprehensible being we love to theorize about , in a vain endeavour to explain the one through the other . Beethoven , like Wagner , was content to realize in himself the power of genius without aspiring to the condition of saintliness . Genius is an affliction ; or , as Goethe put it , a demon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disregarded everything except the work of creation . That is the mark of the possessed , of the creative artist . And with it is stamped out immediately and necessarily much that in the ordinary man is the behaviour resulting from accepted notions of righteousness or morality . Genius stands not only above the society of men , but outside of it . Here begins the everlasting conflict . Mr. Newman has found it incumbent upon himself to knock off the legend of Saint Ludwig by throwing at it all the adverse testimony ever given against the man Beethoven . The thrower works hard , the sentimental plaster flies to right and left . But it is wasted energy ; for when Mr. Newman is done with his  | job , we discover nothing that we did not already know . Beethoven was fond of flattery , he lacked consideration , he was obstinate , he had rude manners , he could be contemptuous of his lesser colleagues , he was ungrateful , he suffered from colossal arrogance , he was self-sufficient , his natural suspiciousness and distrust were aggravated by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the reins to his meddlesome despotism and vile temper , he used scurrilous language , he even descended to questionable business methods . In short , he was an impossible person . Alas , Mr. Newman undoubtedly knows that geniuses are not easy to live with ; they can not be recommended as household pets ; they must be handled with infinite tact and forbearance . Since very few people can clash against super-man wrapped in the hard shell of his egoism and stand the shock without hurt , the " contemporaries " of geniuses are often willing but biased witnesses for the prosecution . The contempt of the great arouses the jealousy of the small . Misunderstandings beget misrepresentation . And so little as a suspicion of unfairness is needed to start the biographical artist-in-plaster , anxious to build up the defence . In our own day we have begun to hear whispered stories ? not surprising nor unbelievable ? which give accounts of the man Debussy strangely contrasting with the perfection of his music . So soon as the gossip will become louder or get into print , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It will no more improve the beauty of his scores than any subsequent plaster-wreckers can abstract from it . Thayer was by no means the only one who truthfully pointed out Beethoven 's weaknesses . All except the most superficial biographers laid on black paint , or at least a dark grey , where the shadows projected . Fifty years ago , when the prophets of Wagner in England were accused of seizing upon Beethoven as " a link in a chain of musical progress supposed to find its culmination in the latest productions of a special school of musicians , " H. H. Statham in the Fortnightly Review wrote that the best proof of Beethoven 's greatness lay in the fact " that even his admirers have not been able to write him down . . . . Hardly anything  | that has been said of Socrates or of Christ equals the tone of solemnity in which Beethoven 's moral greatness , and the future mission of his music in regenerating mankind , are spoken of by some of these zealous apostles . Beethoven was neither a Socrates nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except in the indirect sense in which all high and intellectual pleasures are moral agents . " And Statham ? an architect ? belonged to the plasterers ' union . It was late in the day , therefore , when Mr. Newman girded up his loins and slew the slain . But he went through the motions of a great battle simply because he was afraid that some small portion of the " romantic rubbish " had been permitted to survive , even by the honest and ruthless Thayer . So he decided to do away with it once for all . No better occasion could have been chosen for the alleged cleaning operation than a centenary , which always gathers so much dust . The one point Thayer deliberately passed over with only parenthetical or veiled allusions is the matter of Beethoven 's obvious strayings from the path of purity and the consequences he " is said " to have suffered . Beethoven never married , though most of the time he was " in love . " It was not his fault that he remained single ; more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home and family . His conceptions of wedded life were strict and lofty . But the right woman , fit to bear the crown and the cross of being the wife of Beethoven , did not exist . Merciful luck preserved him from getting tied to the wrong one . Beethoven 's celibacy does not imply chastity . He was no Joseph , nor Sir Galahad . His exuberant vitality , especially in the prime of his life , was blended with a large dose of sensuality . It forms a natural attribute of the creative vigour and the artistic temperament . Duclos , French moralist and friend of Rousseau 's , travelling through Italy in 1767 , observed that castrates make excellent singers but poor composers ; and he shrewdly inferred that " ce do nt on les prive a de grandes influences sur les facultes de 1'dme . " Beethoven 's soul was as ardent as the sap in his veins , and the ardour overflowed into his music . Yet there are critics who  | deny this . Paul Bekker declares that Beethoven 's art " shows no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realm of sexual impulses . " And Mr. Newman thinks that " Beethoven 's music has probably fewer sex-connotations than that of any other composer except Bach 's . " How the sturdy Kantor , father of twenty children , would smile at that ! The sex-connotation lies in the creative urge itself . And to be erotic , music need not be tinged with the pale , dejected passion of Chopin , the purple frenzy of Liszt , or the flame and gold of Wagner 's paroxysm . Can not a scherzo , without being giddy Dr bizarre , spring from the playful daring of amorous pursuit , and an adagio , without being saturated with chromaticism , reflect the warm glow of content in fulfilment ? The very absence of a loud or unhealthy erotic shade in the colouring of Beethoven 's music must be interpreted as a sign that his " love-life " ? such as it was ? was essentially normal . When in a letter to Ries he bemoaned the fact that probably he would never possess the " one woman " of his desire , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 1 And still , Mr. Newman would have us believe that Beethoven suffered from " a perverse sex-obsession , " that he was plagued by " a morbid sex-complex . " Why ? Because his well-grounded disapproval of the wives of his two brothers expressed itself in violent hatred for these decidedly frail ladies , and because he wished to keep his nephew Carl away from dangerous company , just as he had warned his brother Johann , twenty years earlier , to " beware of the whole tribe of bad women . " In order to justify his deductions , Mr. Newman assumes that Beethoven 's " own life had been radically changed for the worse by a youthful imprudence . " This leads us to the question of the venereal disease , or diseases , from which Beethoven " is said " to have suffered . The whole question might well have been left where it stood , in comparative darkness ; for no matter how it is answered ? if a positive answer should ever be found ? it makes little difference now . Footnote  | What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the critical methods of Mr. Newman , the historian . Of course , Mr. Newman is not the first one openly and fearlessly to discuss these things . He quotes from Grove ( 1879 ) and Frimmel ( 1912 ) , besides freely helping himself from the book of Dr. Schweisheimer ( 1922 ) on " Beethoven 's maladies , their influence upon his life-work , " which is really the source of the only pertinent remarks he contributes on the medical side . If the book by Guglielmo Bilancioni , " La Sordita di Beethoven , considerazioni di un otologo " ( 1921 ) , was known to Mr. Newman , he did not mention it among his references . Beethoven 's maladies have always received a good deal of attention , especially in their relation to his deafness . One of the likely causes that have been advanced for it is syphilis . Frimmel , in his recent " Beethoven Handbuch , " under the head of " Krankheiten , " does not forget " die ominose Lues . " The suggestion was Grove 's that the autopsy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably the result of syphilitic affections at an early period of his life . " Although the form of the statement is a relatively guarded one , Grove himself was apparently convinced that it was actually true . In a foot-note to this passage he said : " This diagnosis , which I owe to the kindness of my friend , Dr. Lauder Brunton , is confirmed by the existence of two prescriptions , of which , since the passage in the text was written , I have been told by Mr. Thayer , who heard of them from Dr. Bertolini . " That is a somewhat roundabout route . But people have been hanged and reputations blasted on flimsier grounds than this . The first objection ? and one we shall have to return to later ? is that the diagnostic findings of **29;1330;TOOLONG did not specify whether it was a case of acquired or congenital syphilis . There is a great difference between the two , as far as the " moral " implications go . Either might have been  | possible , with similar effects upon the hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or even conceivably , the cause of deafness , it is in decidedly exceptional cases that a syphilitic affection damages the aural mechanism ; and it is highly improbable that the damage should be symmetrical . Beethoven 's post-mortem revealed nothing that required the acceptance or supposition of syphilis as a necessary or likely cause of any diseased conditions in the ear or any other part of the body . Doctors have been known to disagree . In medicine , more than in any other science , the scope of verified knowledge is constantly being widened , and much of this knowledge is of surprisingly recent date . The later doctor , then , is apt to know more than did the earlier one . In Grove 's chain of hearsay diagnosticians only the first and the last links were medical men . That does not make them the stronger links now . Time has corroded their prestige . Dr. Lauder Brunton was an eminent physician in his day . But that day is no more . His deductions from Beethoven 's postmortem were made in the light of what knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Grove ; now it must be taken with all reserve . In Brunton 's time the study of venereal diseases had not advanced to the point it has reached to-day . They were still held responsible for various conditions now recognized as resulting from other causes . Therefore , Brunton can not be accepted as an infallible authority on venereal diseases ; nor can Bertolini . In Beethoven 's lifetime the medical world was woefully hazy on such things . As a matter of fact , the definite distinction between gonorrhoea and syphilis dates only from the tests made by Philippe Ricord in 1838 , eleven years after Beethoven 's death . Prior to that time syphilis , chancroid , and gonorrhoea were confused as manifestations of one systemic disorder and were treated in more or less the same manner , especially as regards the administering of mercury . In Beethoven 's time mercury was still a sort of panacea and general tonic or alterative . Because it was found efficacious in some maladies , for which it happened to be a specific , it was used in others for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrote :  | Wonderful little , when all is said , Wonderful little our fathers knew . Half their remedies cured you dead ? Most of their teaching was quite untrue It would be a peculiarly distressing thought to picture a hypochondriac Beethoven taking one useless medicine after the other and going from bad to worse , a victim of those who tried to fasten on him a disease he never had . Likewise the two prescriptions of which Grove was told by Thayer , " who had heard of them from Dr. Bertolini , " give us no promise of a solution until we have actually seen them . The presence of mercury in two prescriptions dating from ca. 1815 would hardly establish in themselves a presumption of syphilis , much less an absolute proof . The only document alleged to be first-hand " evidence " and still in existence is " an as yet unpublished note in Beethoven 's own hand referring to a cure that leaves no doubt as to the specific nature of his malady . " But here again we shall have to verify before we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the private possession of a German scientist . Now more than ever the owner of this note is placed under the moral obligation to publish it and submit it to critical scrutiny . The danger of rhapsodizing is apparently as great on the darker side of Beethoven 's life as it is on the luminous one . Veracity is not identical with the gathering of every bit of unverified scandal ; least of all can the method claim to have anything in common with " historical criticism . " There is one piece of direct testimony that stands in particular need of critical inquiry , as it comes nearest to establishing the fact of Beethoven 's sexual mishaps . In 1852 , Otto Jahn went to Vienna to collect material for the Beethoven biography he intended to write . Bertolini was still alive ; Jahn visited him twice  | and each time took notes . At one of these interviews the physician remarked that " Beethoven hatte gewohnlich eine Flamme , die Guicciardi , Frau von Frank , Bettina Brentano ; daneben miselte ' er auch gewohnlich , wobei er @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the verb miseln belonged to the German " fashion words " of the late eighteenth century . Probably they were imported into polite speech and writing by no less a person than Goethe , who must have learned them during his student days in Strassburg . Misel 1 is the diminutive of the Alsatian mus and means " little mouse " ; it acquired the significance of " maiden " when lovingly applied to one ; thence miseln stands for liebeln , which in English is flirting or philandering.2 By forced analogy the Alsatian verb miseln may be pressed to do service for the German mausen , that incorrigible failing of the little rodent , to furtively steal its food . Thus it may come to signify any lighter form of pilfering ; and by bending it over completely , it may be made to lean toward the German naschen , the meanings of which range all the way from an innocent nibbling of sweets to " illicitly to enjoy . " It was a typical student word , and we can well imagine that the young Goethe in Strassburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it attractive and useful . He kept it in his vocabulary . But where he employs it , as in his letters 3 to Frau von Stein , it suggests no more than a harmless flirt . Footnote  | We must assume that in Jahn 's notes the word is not his , but Bertolini 's . If the Viennese of 1852 used the word in the graver sense just indicated , it would imply that the old physician knew of some of Beethoven 's escapades between 1810 and 1815 from which the composer did not always ( " nicht immer " ) return unscathed . The suggested repetition of these misfortunes strongly points to the probability that they had nothing to do with syphilis , but were re-infections or recrudescences of a different nature , which the medical men of those days had not yet learned to distinguish . In fact , the whole profession had been thrown into complete confusion by John Hunter , the famous English physician , who during the last years of the eighteenth century maintained and thought he had proved by experiments that syphilis , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Although Bertolini lived to see Hunter 's error corrected by Ricord , in 1838 , it is doubtful whether these later discoveries were in his mind when he discussed Beethoven with Jahn in 1852 . Whatever venereal disease Bertolini may have thought he was treating in Beethoven , there is so far no convincing evidence or even good reason to fix upon syphilis as that disease . Without going deeper into medical details , we have settled this much : 1 . Since Beethoven 's incipient deafness had declared itself by 1800 , it is impossible to conceive that a venereal disease contracted ten or fifteen years later , if indeed such was contracted , had anything to do with his deafness ; and of " syphilitic affections at any early period of his life " we have no proof , nor does his medical history lead us to believe that such an affection existed . 2 . Any diagnosis of a venereal disease prior to 1838 must be accepted with the greatest reserve , and not even a prescription or a " cure " involving mercury treatment gives trustworthy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reported , burned in 1831 ( when he believed himself at the point of death ) all the letters which Beethoven had written to him , " because a few were not of a  | nature to be risked in careless hands , " the precaution speaks well for the doctor 's discretion , but offers no positive clue to the nature of these confidences . Should they have been concerned with a malady " that had not merely physical but moral connotation , " the deduction ? unsupported by other proof ? that this malady was syphilis can hardly be called " critical . " For the sake of argument it might be objected that , in view of Beethoven 's constant intestinal troubles and his blunt modes of expression , the letters , without touching upon amorous misadventures at all , may have been sufficiently " Rabelaisian " to make it seem desirable to Bertolini that they be kept out of " careless hands . " Moreover , it would be interesting to know whether in 1831 Bertolini destroyed only Beethoven 's letters or those of some other patients @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death from cholera near ? destroyed the greater part of his medical correspondence . Years later Thayer looks him up and asks to see the letters of the great man to his physician . The physician admits he has them no longer , he burned them . Thayer throws up his hands in horror . What better excuse could the embarrassed physician give than to explain his act of vandalism as an act of pious caution ? In the last analysis , not even Bertolini 's " miseln " need have the " incriminating " meaning suggested above . Mr. Newman himself tells us that in 1848 ( or only four years prior to the Bertolini interview ) the editor of Goethe 's letters to Frau von Stein gave the meaning of misel as schone a belle or a sweetheart and miseln as schonthun act the gallant or flirt . Note that the doctor opposed the term to what he said about Giullietta , Christine , and Bettina . These three were " flames " who burned as much in admiration for the composer as he burned in love for them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have accepted Beethoven 's homages more or less enthusiastically ; but besides these known attachments Beethoven " habitually " ( gewohnlich ) flirted with pretty women , unknown and of lesser station , without always capturing his prize . Indeed , there may have been occasions when his attentions were severely rebuffed  | and the poor love-sick bear must have looked rather sheepish . Ries tells of an instance in Baden when he surprised the composer with an unknown woman who had apparently taken offence at something that Beethoven had said or done ; when Beethoven failed in his attempted mending of the wrong move ( to slow music played by Ries ! ) , the tilt ended checkmate and the lady left . There is nothing to prevent us from interpreting Bertolini 's remark as importing just this , that the flirtatious Beethoven , who had exceptional luck with some women ( see Wegeler 's reference to conquests an Adonis might have found impossible ) , was occasionally snubbed ; or ? to translate Bertolini 's words literally ? Beethoven did " not always come off well " ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The idiom is the same in English as in German . Nothing obliges us to see an injury to Beethoven 's health in what may have been no more than a wound to his vanity . It is less of a strain to put a direct and innocent interpretation upon Bertolini 's expression than an equivocal one . Thayer may have thought it a delicate point , for he quoted the first half of Bertolini 's remark , the one about Beethoven 's " flames , " and kept silent about the " miseln . " That was in a line with Thayer 's " exceptionally judicial habit of mind . " Since the remark was made to Jahn and not to Thayer , the latter could not judge , any better than we can now , what special meaning the speaker 's " inflexion " might have imparted to the phrase . Certainly , in Goethe 's letters to Charlotte von Stein the word " miseln " and its derivatives were used in the sense that is currently applied to the English " flirt " or the slangy " necking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here simply to show how much there is yet to be ascertained before any other construction can be built on a foundation of facts . The time is past when Beethoven needed " shielding . " We make ourselves ridiculous if we attempt to throw the cloak of our  | conventions round the shoulders of a giant . The thought no longer shocks us that the composer of a " Missa Solemnis " had promiscuous sex relations . We must be reconciled to the whims of nature , which dooms the spirit who conceives the music of a " Credo in unum Deum " to pursue indifferently pretty Grabennymphen or unkempt servant wenches , to become flesh in their embrace . The probability is greater of our discovering the truth in what the living Beethoven confessed about himself than of finding it in what Mr. Newman imagined about him one hundred years after his death . We have Beethoven 's own word for it that he was " no woman-hater " ; and at the time he wrote this he had no reason to lie , nor cause for wanting to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were his own . And to judge by what we know of his life , he did not shed his feathers at an early age . It is sophistry to postulate " a youthful imprudence " and a syphilitic affection merely in order to explain Beethoven 's anxiety for the moral welfare of his brothers and nephew . The violent hatred for his dissolute sisters-in-law , his solicitude for the weak brothers and weaker nephew , were all perfectly natural . Any healthy person imbued with the least family pride and family love would have done as much . And we know that Beethoven 's pride was exceeded only by his capacity for love . Complex and extraordinary as his character was , Beethoven showed no trait of mind , no singularity of behaviour , that has been observed exclusively or predominantly among syphilitics . Mr. Newman 's suggestion of a " perverse sex-obsession " and a " morbid sex-complex " based on the presence of syphilis is interesting . But it so happens that Beethoven 's " abnormalities " can all be explained quite simply without resorting to an assumption @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indisputable proof . The first one openly to include syphilis among Beethoven 's half-dozen or more maladies was Sir George Grove in the first edition of his famous " Dictionary " ( 1879 ) .1 The main prop for Footnote  | the syphilis-theory was Beethoven 's deafness . But that prop collapses when we bear upon it with our present-day medical knowledge . Whether Beethoven 's deafness was due to an impairment of the conducting mechanism of the ear , secondary to a disease of Footnote  | the middle ear , or to a chronically progressive affection ( otosclerosis ) of the inner ear , of indeterminate etiology , in neither case would it be necessary or normal to presuppose a syphilitic origin . The autopsy , contrary to Lauder Brunton 's opinion , did not describe any condition which suggested the effects of an acquired or congenital syphilis . Dr. Schweisheimer is categorical on that score . He sees no correlation between the deafness of Beethoven and syphilis . He believes that Beethoven suffered from a disease of the inner ear ( labyrinth ) , not of the nature of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is convinced that it was a case of otosclerosis ( Per me si trattd indubbiamente di una otosclerosi ) and points out that this affection is not limited to the middle ear , as Schweisheimer thinks , but can spread to the inner ear ( E erroneo quanto sostiene it Schweisheimer the nella otosclerosi ii processo si limiti all ' orecchio medio ) . Frimmel adheres to Bilancioni 's diagnosis , first made by Dr. Leo Jacobsohn in 1910 . Whatever we know from Beethoven 's own descriptions about the progress of his deafness ? the pains , the inner noises he heard ( tinnitus ) , and the vanishing perception of higher notes ? is in accordance with the clinical picture of an otosclerosis , particularly that form which involves anatomically the osseous labyrinth ( hyperostosis of the cochlea ) . The autopsy revealed that " the Eustachian tube the canal connecting the middle ear with the naso-pharynx was much thickened , its mucous lining swollen and somewhat contracted about the osseous portion of the tube ; in front of its orifice and toward the tonsils some dimpled scars were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several and severe " colds " from which Beethoven suffered at an early age resulted in a low-grade infection such as might be caused by a streptococcic invasion ; in character the process is analogous to that which affects the joints , or the valves of the heart , or the glandular organs , producing always degenerative and fibrotic changes . The primary disease , which eventually induces these later degenerative changes in the ear , may arise from infections
