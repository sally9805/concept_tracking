At 3 o'clock one afternoon last week citizens of Hankow . China 's temporary capital , heard the ominous roar of approaching airplanes . Within a few seconds they sighted , coming from the northeast in perfect formation , 50 Japanese bombers and pursuit planes . A few minutes later the authoritative echo of exploding bombs reverberated through Hankow 's narrow streets . <P> Not unfamiliar to most of the 1,500,000 inhabitants of Hankow and environs are air raids , but those Orientals and whites who did not run to air-raid shelters soon learned that this one was different . Out of cloud banks north of Hankow began to dart fast pursuit planes unlike those guarding the big Japanese bombers . They dived , attacked the invaders .

Most of the crashing planes seemed to be Japanese . <P> At the end of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " tallied the Japanese casualties at twelve pursuit planes , eight bombers . Later , back in Shanghai , a Japanese communique put the Chinese losses at 51 planes , said only two of the Mikado 's raiding craft had failed to return . Although U.

That the Japanese might have difficulty maintaining their aerial superiority was indicated by the arrival via British-controlled Hong Kong of huge airplane shipments from western Europe , of other flying fortresses from Soviet Russia via Soviet-controlled Outer Mongolia . <P> The principal object of the raid was not China 's provisional capital , but the arsenal across the river at Hanyang . Although the arsenal was undamaged , a crowded circular area facing the Yangtze was destroyed at the cost of hundreds of lives .
