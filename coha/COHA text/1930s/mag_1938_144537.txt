Pet project of Cuba 's Army Strongman , Colonel Fulgencio Batista , is his Three-Year Plan , a 20-point New Deal inaugurated last year . Under it he has thus far distributed to indigent farmers well over 300,000 acres of State lands and lands formerly leased to private individuals and companies , constructed some 700 schools where army noncoms act as teachers , restricted the employment of foreigners and imposed price and minimum wage restrictions on the sugar industry . However , the surface of his mass of social , economic-reforms has not been scratched . So extensive are the proposed reforms that cynical oppositionists have dubbed the program " Batista 's 300-Year Plan . " <P> Last week , dramatically affirming that the Plan still " represents my highest ideals , " Strongman Batista suddenly announced that further legislation on it would be " suspended " until after the Presidential elections early next year . Reason for this unexpected move : squat , peasant-born Batista.has engineered the seating of five men in the Presidential chair and now hankers to fill the position himself . The Plan , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regiment all phases of their national life , is regarded by Boss Batista as too much of a controversial issue to push at the time of an election .
