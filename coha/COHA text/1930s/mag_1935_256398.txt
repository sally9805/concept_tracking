Black-uniformed black-helmeted Schutzstaffel ( Special Guards ) ringed Berlin 's Kroll Opera House last week while a battalion of grey Reichswehr troops stood as a guard of honor before the door . In public squares all over Berlin , all over Germany , other crowds stood gaping at the trumpet horns of loudspeakers . Inside the Opera House the brown-shirted Reichstag had been called to order by paunchy Hermann Wilhelm Gring . It had risen , once to honor the memory of Bavarian Minister of Education Hans Schem , killed in an airplane accident , once to do the same for the late Marshal Pilsudski of Poland . It had welcomed the newly elected delegates from the Saar making their first appearance in the Reichstag since the War , and had thundered applause when Minister of the Interior Frick announced the completion of Germany 's new conscription law ( see col. 1 . ) . Then cried Premier Gring : " Der Fhrer has the floor ! " Adolf Hitler almost jumped from his chair to the rostrum where he unfolded his speech amid a din of clapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter he talked . <P> As has happened many times before , German foreign policy last week had Herr Hitler in an uncomfortable position . Constant sabre-rattling had driven France and Italy together , brought about the Franco-Russian accord and seemed likely to cost Germany all her recent gains with Poland . Private reports from Premier Gring 's secret conversations with France 's Laval in Poland showed that now if ever was the time to curry favor by beating a strategic retreat . That it should seem no retreat at all to Nazi ears , Realmleader Hitler shrewdly decided to beat it in as loud a voice as possible . When he finally stepped from the rostrum last week , Der Fhrer was so hoarse he could scarcely speak . <P> Keynote of the whole speech was in one sentence : " For the next ten or 20 years Germany will be occupied with her domestic program . Germany needs peace and wants peace . " <P> Going further , Adolf Hitler announced at the top of his lungs 13 points of German foreign policy . They were : <P> 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 17 that Germany alone has violated the Versailles Treaty . Germany will never return to the League until full equality of rights has been established . <P> 2 ) Germany has only repudiated the arms provisions of the treaty . She promises to respect all the rest , including territorial provisions , and will seek revision only by peaceful means . <P> 3 ) Germany will observe all treaties now in force , even those signed by previous Socialist German governments . Particularly , she will observe the Locarno Pact ( as long as the other signatories do ) and the prohibitions against fortifying the Rhineland . <P> 4 ) Germany will participate in collective co-operation to secure peace , providing only that the possibility of treaty revision is allowed . <P> 5 ) Germany believes that the reconstruction of Europe can never be brought about by conditions dictated by one side alone . <P> 6 ) Germany will sign non-aggression treaties with all her neighbors except Lithuania ( from whom she is now trying to wrest the city of Memel ) because Germany can not enter into political treaties with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ society . <P> 7 ) Germany will sign an international air pact to supplement the Locarno Treaty .
