George Benjamin Luks of Manhattan , originally of Williamsport , Pa. , was twice in the news last week . In Baltimore , as judge of a Pan-American exhibition of paintings opened with unction by Secretary of State Henry Lewis Stimson as " an outstanding event in the history of Pan-American cultural relations , " he helped to award the $1,000 first prize to Alfredo Guttero of Argentina for a formalized , thick-necked Madonna somewhat reminiscent of the woodcuts of Britain 's Eric Gill . The award moved Baltimore Catholics to indignant frenzy . Thundered the Catholic Review : <P> " It is a repulsive and hideous caricature of the immaculate Mother of God . The Catholic taxpayers of Baltimore . . . must feel indignant that their money has been used to present to the public such an indecent and disgusting picture . " <P> In Manhattan George Benjamin Luks exhibited at the Rehn Galleries 21 carefully chosen pictures of his own , eleven oils , ten water colors . Critics were enthusiastic . Recent subjects ranged from his neighbors in the Berkshires to a self portrait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : <P> " It is obvious that he is representative of no temporary fashion in the art of this country , but of its enduring quality , and when he exhibits such canvases as the most recent of those in the present exhibition he is lifting its standard to a new and higher level . " <P> Added the New York World : " George Luks 's portraits . . . carry the whiff of the hill country where they were painted . " All spoke admiringly that such obvious improvement in power , in sureness , was possible in a painter well past 60 . <P> No other well-meaning compliment would so surely annoy Artist Luks . A beefy , lusty fellow , in excellent health , he realizes as well as any of his critics that he is now doing the best work of his career , takes great delight in defending the accomplishments of middle age over the showy triumphs of youth . <P> " In all the more difficult callings , " says he , " those in which sheer luck and low cunning are of least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 60 . This is as true in the rarefied upper realms of business as anywhere else . The younger man who manages to attain to some showy second or third rank among financiers and businessmen is so remarkable that the cheer leaders of low literature . . . and the sob sisters move down upon his abode in echelon formation . ... In the arts the matter is notorious . There are young geniuses and child prodigies , who are admired like the aardvark and the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus , but all the solid and enduring work is done by men who have lived long enough to have mastered their metier and life itself . " <P> This generalization is obviously true so far as the enduring work of George Luks is concerned . His artistic apprenticeship has been long and tough . When still in his ' teens he worked with his brothers in the highly specialized profession of safe-painting , decorating the strong boxes of merchants with elegant sunsets , landscapes , floral trophies . He varied this by painting band wagons , houses , campaign posters . Artist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fortune by painting his signs on the sides of old-fashioned grocery stores . He saved enough to study painting in Philadelphia , in Paris , Dsseldorf , London .
