Born 59 years ago in Columbia City , Ind. , Dr. Douglas entered the field of fiction by " sheer accident in 1929 , after having written sermons and essays for 25 years . His first three novels , Green Light ( 1934 ) , Forgive Us Our Trespasses ( 1932 ) , Magnificent Obsession ( 1929 ) , sold more than 340,000 copies . Similar to those works in its fine moral tone , its unabashed sentimentality , and the neat working out of a plot which brings all characters to happy conclusions , White Banners also carries a plea for forgiveness and unquestioning self-sacrifice in the face of the multitudinous tribulations of modern life , and dramatizes the message that patience , courage and service to humanity is conducive not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No mere romancer , Dr. Douglas drops Hannah 's story from time to time , lectures on the fundamental beliefs that give her poise and wisdom . <P> Thus when Paul Ward invents a new refrigerator only to have his invention stolen , he plans to sue his swindlers until Hannah dissuades him . When he complains that her advice of nonresistance means hoisting the white flag , she cries " White banners !

Although few readers are likely to accept her counsel unequivocally , it certainly works out well in Paul 's case . He writes a life of Spenser that wins him academic acclaim , later invents a better refrigerator that makes his fortune .
