txt  | America , " the Athabaskan tribes of the Mackenzie River speak languages in which such words i. e. , imsonic words seem to be nearly or entirely absent , while they are used freely enough in languages as sophisticated as English and German . Such an instance shows how little the essential nature of speech is concerned with mere imitation of things . " This attitude owes something of its quality , no doubt , to a reaction against such earlier theorists as the Rev. Frederic W. Farrar . Farrar , in answer to Mailer 's refutation of the **28;230047;TOOLONG theory , wrote in 1865 his Chapters on Language . Farrar 's work seems to me surprisingly modern , for all the seventy-odd years that have passed since it was written ? years of primary importance to the study of languages . I le regarded interjection and echoism as " a steppingstone to true language , by both suggesting the idea of articulate speech and by supplying a large number , if not the entire number of actual roots . " So , too , Whitney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing the selfsame metaphor : " There was doubtless a period in the progress of speech when its whole structure was palpably onomatopoetic ; but not a long one : the onomatopoetic stage was only a stepping-stone to something higher and better . " Surely Farrar 's last statement is difficult of acceptance ; the exaggeration , however , as in the case of the onomatopoetic origin of animal names , should not deafen us to the probability that it advances . Farrar is indeed quite convincing in his discussion of concealed onomatopes ; even Sapir is careful to write that sound-imitative words seem to be nearly or entirely absent . Much of the absence may , indeed , be seeming . There are even abstract terms ? to adduce some of my own examples ? in which the onomatopoetic element is hidden by the incorporation of later linguistic forms . The Greek lalein , ' to speak , ' sounds even now like the exercise of the tongue . La-la is derived from one of the first sounds made by the child playing with , or learning control of , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue-play . Lullaby is another word  | whose l 's testify to an origin in childish lingual experimentation . When we sing a wordless melody we revert naturally to lallation ? to la , la , la , of which such variants as fal , la , la and tra , la , la are a slightly sophisticated development . A lesser-known theory , which attempted to account for the beginnings of language without having recourse to the theory of echoisms , is that of Ludwig Noire ; it is nicknamed the " Yo-he-ho . " Why " Yo-he-ho " ? Because of the rhythmic chant ( at first a breath-expulsion ) of men engaged in a common physical task . One thinks of Stevenson 's " Yo-ho-ho , and a bottle of rum ! " One recalls , too , the same expression in the process of becoming a noun , as in Gilbert 's The Mikado : With a yeo heave ho And a rumbelow .. . Also , there are the Negro chain gangs , and the rhythmic emission of breath after each strong blow of the hammer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conventionally suggested by some such grunting combination as Hanh . Such sounds as these , argued Noire , would give the name to the activity that caused them . The earliest words , then , were associated with communal labor . Just as imitative sounds are but approximative at best , so are these theories at best approximative . It is impossible to imagine ourselves back in the days of man 's first experience with speech . There is reason , for example , to believe that man 's sight was more retentive , so to say , than is ours . The conjectural phenomenon has been called , by its discoverer , Rudolf Jaensch , " eidetic imagery , " a term referring not to the after-image that is familiar to all , but to a faculty of retaining for a long time the retinal impress of an image . The faculty is found , according to Jaensch and his followers , here and there among children and even adults ; it was in early racial life not the exception but the rule . There may be , in language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word idea , in fact , means an image , and is akin to our word idol , from eidolon , Greek for the same thing . It  | is remarkable that idea and the words that cluster about it are associated not only with seeing but with knowing . Idea and wit are cognates , that is , cousin-words , born ultimately of the same linguistic root . ( Sanskrit vid , ' to find ' ; German wissen , ' to know ' ; Greek idein , ' to see , ' and oida , ' I know ' ; Russian vidyet , ' to see . ' ) The connection between seeing and knowing is proverbial ; " seeing is believing . " Knowledge is a mental image , hence the current meaning of idea . Sight , then , may have played a far greater part in primitive life and thought than it does in our own . We still dream chiefly in images ; the imaginal element , when speech was less developed , must have been even greater . Imagination ( the creation of images @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thus linked etymologically as well as in fact . The first alphabets , like so many first " thoughts , " were pictures . Sight , too , may have played a vital role in the development of metaphors ; if the theory of eidetic imagery is based upon truth , sight must have contributed importantly to the mental , and therefore the linguistic process .  | IF MOLLER WERE LECTURING TO-DAY HE WOULD PROBABLY have christened the suggestions of Sir Richard Paget as " the wig-wag theory . " For , to Paget , a physicist interested in the mechanics of speech , the role of bodily movements seems predominant in the early history of language . His conception of gesture is , as it should be , broad . Man , he maintains , was driven to the invention of speech not by the need of transmitting thought so much as by the fact that he required his hands for such fundamental tasks as hunting , planting , and the emergent crafts . " Originally , man expressed his ideas by gesture , but as he gesticulated with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a ridiculous fashion . . . . The consequence was that when , owing to the pressure of other business , the principal actors ( the hands ) retired from the stage . . . their understudies , the tongue , lips and jaw . . . were already proficient in the pantomimic art . " Then the great discovery was made that if while making  | a gesture with the tongue and lips , air was blown through the oral and nasal cavities , the gesture became audible as a whispered sound . If , while pantomiming with tongue , lip and jaw , our ancestors sang , roared or grunted ? in order to draw attention to what they were doing , a still louder and more remarkable effect was produced , namely , what we call voiced speech . " 1 To sounds expressive of gestural equivalents , such as st ! , ps ! , sch ! , brr ! , Heyse gave the name Lautgeberden , or vocal gestures . Similarly , there must have been , in the beginnings , gestures that called upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well be , for example , that gesture was the first grammar . Man had sounds for things long before he had sounds for relationships . To point was much simpler than to invent , for the occasion , a dative or an accusative case , or a genitive ending . Case endings and prepositions are , from this standpoint , vocalized gestures pointing toward or away from the speaker . It was well along in the history of any language that certain words , once full of meaning , were emptied of their original significance and devoted exclusively to indicating syntactical relationship . The Chinese , indeed , call such words " empty . " And it is itself significant , in connection with the gesture theory , that significant means making signs . ' The gesture theory supplements rather than replaces the others that we have been considering . It is very plausible . Primitive speech must have made far greater use of the whole body than do we to-day . Excitable children and adults talk with their entire body . Paget conjectures that in primitive times the tongue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such protrusion , and not only in impudence . We have seen that many persons , in writing and in such employment as the use of the scissors , accompany the manual exercise with mimetic movements of the tongue , lips , and jaw . We still , when released from the dictates of etiquette , " make faces " at each other . To the prominence of the tongue in primitive life ( recall  | what has been said of lallation and lullaby ) it may be possible to attribute so essential a word as love itself . The Aryan root lublz is regarded as a tongue-gesture of sexual significance , to which may go back the offensiveness of the mockingly protruded tongue . Paget assigns a somatic ( i. e. , bodily ) symbolism to certain consonants and vowels ; in this respect he appears to be a scientific continuator of Plato , who does the same thing in his dialogue Kratylos . Thus the English physicist advances the belief that p , b , m , and bh are the essential sound-images of closing , containing , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were holding something between one 's tightened lips . ) The Aryan root swap , meaning sleep , ' is made up , according to this conjecture , of sw ? the human eye ? and p , the closing of the lips that stands for the closing of the eye . Gesture , among other things , is one of the first forms of drawing ; it depicts , so to speak , upon the air . Sound-gesture , such as Paget draws upon in this etymology , is precisely what it is called : a gesture that has become sound , that has pictorial symbolism as well as vocal . In such a view the organs of the mouth and the stream of air issuing through this orifice become analogous to the other openings of the body . Thus , in mi , the i represents a confinement of the breath-stream , the m acting as a boundary . Our ancestors did not share our hyper-estheticism with regard to natural functions . " It is likely , " writes Paget , " that the natural evacuations would be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( It is quite as natural , to other theorists , that the first names should be given , in imitative fashion , to animals . The point is secondary . ) " I shall , therefore , take the Polynesian word mi-mi , used to express the voiding of urine . . . . Suppose , then , in the rudimentary state of things we are considering , someone , imagining that he has found a proper term for the act , calls the attention of another to it , uttering at the same time the two syllables mi mi , ' and that this other individual attempts to reproduce and succeeds in reproducing the sound . Would not the two actions , the one which he was  | performing by means of the organs of speech , the other at which he was looking , have a certain resemblance to each other ? Would they , in effect , have any essential difference , but that in one there was an xrial , in the other a liquid stream ? Is there anything , therefore , impossible in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound mi mi had in it some certain appropriateness to the act of urinating ? . . . That we can call both currents ( air or water ) a stream seems to help Paget 's conjecture . The double syllable mi-mi , in fact , has become the word for urination , not only in Polynesia but in such far-flung nations as those speaking Sanskrit ( mih ) , Greek ( omicho ) and Latin ( mingo ) . I may add that the strengthening of mi into pi is effected by a firmer conjunction of the lips , whence the ( to us ) more familiar syllables for the same evacuation : pee-pee . M is associated the world over with the closing of the lips after feeding at the breast . Polynesian for nipple is u , a labial imitative sound . U thus comes to mean ' milk , ' ' to be damp , ' moisture ' ; ua is ' rain ' ; uma is ' breast ' ; umauma ( two breasts ) signifies ' the chest . ' The word mama , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' is likewise regarded as a labial imitation . Of this , however , more when we consider the importance of the child and the woman to language . Related to what might be called the mammary m is the onomatope yum yum , which is an approximative sound-image of the smacking of the lips that accompanies the enjoyment of a tasteful delicacy . Jespersen mentions the Scotch nyam or nyamnyam , and the English seaman 's term yam , ' to eat , ' as well as the French nanan , in the sense of sweetmeats . " Some linguists , " he adds , in a sentence that makes us think of Paget 's derivation of love , " will have it that the Latin amo , I love , is derived from this am , which expresses pleasurable satisfaction . " The sound of eating , in Paget 's reproductive scheme , becomes mnyum-mnyum , or mnyamnya ? " words which probably would be almost universally understood , and which ac- tually occur as a children 's word for food in Russian as well as in English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sucking liquid in small quantities into the mouth , if blown ' . . . produces the whispered words sip , sup , according to the exact position of the tip of the tongue behind the lower teeth . " 2 The onomatope yum-yum achieved personalized celebrity when Gilbert chose it as the name for his heroine in The Mikado . Other characters in this famous travesty owe their names to a like personification ; Pooh-Bah and Pish-Tush began their lives as interjections . Certainly Yum-Yum was supposed to be sweet enough to eat ; since the first form of loving , in the infant , is eating , the derivation of Latin amo may not be so fanciful as it seems . In the non-human kingdom love and cannibalism sometimes ( as amongst the spiders ) achieve a disconcerting identity . Yet another suggestive theory of linguistic origins comes from Otto Jespersen , one of the leading experts in the contemporary science of language . Jespersen is no academician ; he is , indeed , one of the most humane of philologists . He is mindful , as are an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly an accomplished metaphysician . The chief concerns of that ancestor of ours were food and shelter and , so far as the beginnings of language occur , instinctual and emotional expression rather than so complex a thing as thought . " Language , " according to Jespersen , " originated as play , and the organs of speech were first trained in this singing sport of idle hours . " The genesis of language , then , " is not to be sought in the prosaic but in the poetic side of life ; the source of speech is not gloomy seriousness , but merry play and youthful hilarity . And among the emotions which were most powerful in elicit- ing outbursts of music and of song , love must be placed in the first rank . To the feeling of love , which has left traces of its vast influence on countless points in the evolution of organic nature , are due not only , as Darwin has shown , the magnificent colours of birds and flowers , but also many of the things that fill us with joy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ songs , and through them was instrumental in bringing about human language . In primitive speech I hear the laughing cries of exultation when lads and lasses vied with one another to attract the attention of the other sex , when everybody sang his merriest and danced his bravest to lure a pair of eyes to throw admiring glances in his direction . Language was born in the courting days of mankind ; the first utterances of speech I fancy to myself like something between the nightly love-lyrics of puss upon the tiles and the melodious love-songs of the nightingale . " This is , like other theories , after all but a speculative presentation . It is refreshing , nevertheless , to discover in a philologist a sense of humor as well as of humanity . Language is the product of very imperfect creatures upon whom logic and responsibility to grammar and dictionaries rests not at all . Jespersen , however , disclaims belief in an idyllic prehistory , such as his passage on love and language has suggested to some critics . " I have never believed , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-off golden age , but rather incline to believe in a progressive movement from a very raw and barbarous age to something better , though it must be said that our own age , with its national wars , world wars and class wars , makes one sometimes ashamed to think how little progress our so-called civilization has made . But primitive ages were probably still worse , and the only thing I have felt bold enough to maintain is that in those days there were some moments consecrated to youthful hilarity , and that this gave rise , among other merriment , to vocal play of such a character as closely to resemble what we may infer from the known facts of linguistic history to have been a stage of language earlier than any of those  | accessible to us . There is no romanticism ' ( in a bad sense ) in such a theory . . . . " 3 Jespersen does not , moreover , limit his theory to the expression of love songs ; any powerful emotion might result in singing , which is considered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As for the nature of these songs , they need not even have contained definite words ; how definite , essentially , are the words of many songs to-day ? " Men sang out their feelings long before they were able to speak their thoughts , " says Jespersen . This appears to be a reasonable deduction . Feelings came before thought , as songvoice came before analytic , verbal speech , and as poetry ( the expression of feeling ) came before prose ( the expression of thought ) . The first songs were in all likelihood a noncommunicative , purely expressive , intoned babbling , resembling the unconscious progress of the infant toward speech . It is no derogation of poetry or of song to discover one of their origins in just such intoned babbling . Alverdes , in his Social Life in the Animal World , has written that , " Talking is infectious , and it is impossible to deny that human conversation rests upon the same instinctive basis as the social sounds produced by animals . " The communal croaking of frogs , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alive . It may be regarded as an animal equivalent of what , amongst us , is called " small talk . " Malinowski , for what may be called this talking for talk 's sake , has invented a high-sounding term : " phatic communion . " The chit-chat of his Trobriand islanders is but another evidence of conversation ? the sound of the voices of one 's companions ? as a fundamental element of social and psychological comfort , an emotional reassurance , the vocal evidence or sign of " belonging . " As for the poetic quality of primitive expression , Tylor , in his Primitive Culture , long ago anticipated Jespersen , and ,  | for that matter , the psychoanalytic explanations of creative art . " A poet of our own day , " he wrote , " has still much in common with the minds of uncultured tribes in the mythologic stage of thought . " Primitive language , like all creative process , links up with the dream , which to early man was not the sharply differentiated phenomenon that we know and study @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " is an involuntary art of poetry . " Poetry , we may add ( i. e. , creative literature ) , thus becomes a voluntary art of the dream . This is but another variant of Coleridge 's illuminating phrase , " the voluntary suspension of disbelief . " It is possible , however , that Jespersen 's use of such terms as poetry and song is misleading , just as the use of such terms as magic has proved confusing to lay readers and even to the specialists themselves . What appear to us as poetry and as magic are not necessarily poetry and magic to the primitive . Magic , as the newer ethnologists have pointed out , is the best science available to primitive man . For his imperfect conception of causal relations it provides as acceptable an answer to his practical problems as does science to ours . Magic is the best he has been able to achieve in the control of his universe ; it is sober , serious business to him , not the hocuspocus of a state magician ; it is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with poetry . Figures of speech are far more frequent in the daily speech of primitive languages than they are in ours . To be sure , as we shall see abundantly , our language is replete with metaphors ; but they are no longer felt as such . The metaphor , among primitives , was in more than one sense alive . To us , such speech now appears as poetic ; to the man who first made use of figurative language it was as sober and serious a business as was his magic ; it was the best he could do under the circumstances and at his stage of development . Figures of speech were attempts at clarification ; they were utilities , and clumsy utilities ; not , as with us , in poetry , a conscious departure from prose .  | As the magic of the primitive is , to him , " science , " the poetry of Jespersen 's primitive must have been , to him , " prose . " To the primitive mind , such as we attempt to reconstruct it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between science and magic . These represent later differentiations , which have not become clear even to the larger portion of the civilized world as we know it to-day . As language derives from a distinctly utilitarian source , so , too , do such partially linguistic constructions as myth and rite . The myth , the dance , the rite , are poetry to us , who can stand outside and above their primitive use as instrumentalities . In fact , we find it impossible to stand inside of and on a level with them ; invariably , until we have learned better , we interpret them from the vantage point of our own age and mentality . An aboriginal tribe seemingly abandons itself to an orgy of indiscriminate lust . The very language in which we report the event to ourselves is saturated with our own moral preconceptions . We fail at the very start ; our approach is strewn with linguistic snares . Not only is the primitive in question responding to a code radically different from ours ; his efforts belong to a mode of science that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no orgy at all , any more than the so-called religious prostitution is , in our sense , prostitution . It is a fertility rite . He is invoking the gods to fecundate the soil , even as the men of the tribe are fecundating their women . His passionate belief in the magical potency of imitation is so great that he ascribes to Nature his own response to example . The primitive , however ? and this is the special point ? is not poetizing ; he is seeking to control Nature even when he implores her or exorcises her . The law of linguistic evolution , as of evolution in other spheres , shows a progress from chaos to cosmos , from undifferentiated mass to ordered complexity . To have achieved the distinction between feeling and thought , between magic and science , between poetry and prose , is to have reached a high stage of analytic understanding , which is quite beyond the  | power of the primitive . When it was reached , it was reached not as a result of sitting down and cogitating upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of actual experience . Language is not theory ; it is experience , it is situation , it is a form of practical action long before it becomes a form of thought . It is even more than action ; it is interaction . Related to such a theory as Jespersen 's ? and there is a broader sense in which all these theories are interrelated and even interdependent ? are the various sexual theories of the origin of language . According to one of these theories , the vowel sounds originated in the sex call . Sucking and breathing sounds ( whence such onomatopes as German saugen , to suck ' ; Latin suavis for gentle , ' rooted in the sound-imitation su for the wind ' and akin to susurrus , a whisper ' ; English sip , sup , soup ) share a sexual and an ingestive significance . ' But why only a sexual call for the origin of the vowel ? Why not any call arising from an action necessarily oft-repeatedthe cry of warning or of fear , the cry of hunger  --  each of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cry of sex ? jespersen 's love theory , in association with certain observations of Paget , leads to yet another early aspect of language that has been sadly neglected , especially in the schools . This neglect is responsible for much imperfect understanding of poetry and song , and of words themselves . I refer to the close primitive association of music and language . No great knowledge of music is required to perceive the general nature of this association and its importance to speech . The larynx is a music box ; the sounds we make , even without forming definite words , have a transmissive significance . The development of these sounds into an artistic system of emotional communication has produced the art of music . The  | voice came long before the crudest musical instruments , just as hand-clapping and foot-stamping preceded the elementary drum . Instruments are thus projections of , magnifications of , the human voice and the human limbs . " The vocal cords , " says Paget , " supply the language of the emotions , and just as our facial expression ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affection , and the like , so the lips of our vocal cords change their expression , and consequently produce changes of laryngeal sound as the air from our lungs is forced out between them . It is the rising and falling of the pitch of the speaking voice which carries the emotional message , while the movements of articulation ? remote descendants of the original descriptive pantomime made by primitive man ? carry the intentional message which accompanies it . " 8 Language is thus , quite literally , words set to music . If music has been mistakenly regarded as a " universal " language it is because emotions are more general than words . Music , however , like other languages , undergoes distinct developments . Chinese music is not truly understood by Western ears any more than American jazz music is truly understood by Chinese ears that have not been educated to it . The academic terms denotation and connotation may be better understood if the ineradicable musical element of language is kept in mind . Words not only mean ; they suggest . They have not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meanings . The fundamental meaning is the denotation ; the secondary meanings are grouped in a connotation . Consider such terms as unspeakable , unutterable , and ineffable . They all denote , generally , the same idea . Yet the first connotes baseness ; the second suggests poetic diction ; the third implies exaltation . Such a difference in connotation has nothing to do with the musical element of speech ; it is deeply associated with the history of the respective words . The same word , however , according to the manner in which it is spoken ( i. e. , sounded ) may be made to carry various connotations . The simple imperative " Come ! " may , by the musi- cal differences of the utterance , be made to connote tenderness , impatience , imperiousness , doubt , hope . The power of oratory lies as much in the music of the orator 's voice as in the dictionary meanings of the words that he pronounces . In speaking ironically ? an effect that is so difficult , not to say dangerous , when entrusted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words that one is speaking to a music that manifestly denies them . This so-called setting goes back to the primitive sounds that we have called interjections , and to the rising and falling of pitch that betrays , wordlessly , our emotions . Music , like spoken words , has its sound-imitations , its onomatopoeia . I am not speaking now of the aesthetic values of music , but of its ultimate origins in the human voice and the human body . When the violins tremble ( tremolo ) they are harking hack to just such an onomatope as we suggest by the expression brr ! for the shivering caused by fear or by cold . When the music becomes faster and faster it suggests directly the palpitation of fear , precisely as Eugene O'Neill suggested it by the acceleration of the drum-beat that throbs through the performance of The Emperor Jones . More subtly , when there is a long , slow rise in a melody , or a slow descent , the suggestion is that of a deep sigh . The effect , in the famous " Liebestod @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final aria from Aida CO , terra addio ! " ) is unmistakable . I do not offer these effects as exhibits of good music ; generally , indeed , they make one suspect music of indifferent quality , and are as little associated , necessarily , with good music as alliteration is with good poetry , or with good prose . Alliteration ? the repetition of a consonant or of a consonant group ? is in language a musical effect . So is assonance ? the rhyming of vowels instead of vowels and consonants . The essential difference between " quantity " and " stress accent " ? that bugaboo of all students of the ancient tongues ? is one that can not be really understood without a knowledge of music . Versification , indeed , is as much a musical as a verbal process .  | The very word prosody , ' ' in its two final syllables , - ody , contains the Greek word for song , which has given us our word ode ; it appears not only in such terms as melody , psalmody , hymnody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedy and comedy . Early drama , everywhere , was naturally sung , not merely declaimed . Our pleasure in opera and operetta , regarded as a convention in which words are sung instead of spoken , surely derives in part from precisely the opposite source : this so-called convention goes back to a time when song and speech were organically allied ; it reaches back to an ancient need . In the grip of great emotion we express ourselves rhythmically and with far greater musicality than in ordinary intercourse . One of the important relics of music in our speech goes by the name of intonation , a word that speaks ? or sings ? for itself . Language , far more than we realize , is sung as well as spoken . Such tongues as Chinese , indeed , and , in a lesser degree , Swedish , make of tonal differences an essential element of the language ; a word , in Chinese , changes in meaning with change of pitch . When we learn a new language it is not only our native sound-system ( our phonetics @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ background as well ? the music of our language . To learn properly a foreign tongue we must learn not only words and word-structure , but the characteristic melodic outlines of the new language . The social element of language ? what we have called " small talk " or " talking for talk 's sake , " and what Malinowski has named " phatic communion " ? is almost as much music as verbal meaning . Not for nothing do the Spaniards have , for what we irreverently call " hot air , " the poetical term musica celestial , or heavenly music . ' There must be irony in the adjective ; but certainly far more conversation than we like to  | The theories that have been considered or summarized thus far come under the heading of conjecture . The dawn of language goes so far back into prehistory that unquestionable documentation is lacking . Intelligent guesswork proceeds by arguing from the known to the less known and thence to the problematical unknown . Linguists to-day are still curious as to whether languages evolved from a single source ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ polygenesis ) ; they are not too much concerned with the answer , however , any more than they are too much concerned with the ultimate origin of speech itself . Perhaps they are , as a body , too little concerned , since speculation upon any single aspect may shed light on a number of others . What preoccupies linguists is the manner in which verbal forms and meanings change . I speak of forms rather than of words because language did not begin with what we know as words . Words represent a highly analytical process ; primitive man was not an analyst . To understand the evolution of languages we must have a conception of how meaning itself ? as distinguished from human and prehuman intelligence ? arose and developed ; we must know and feel that words ( or such sound-clusters as , among our primitive ancestors , took the place of words ) are at once sound , form , and sense . The sounds undergo change ; the forms undergo change ; the meanings undergo change . All is change . Nor is this something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on all the time , and will continue as long as man 's breath is shaped into meaning . The study of language primarily from the standpoint of sound is called phonetics ( Greek phone , sound ' ) . The study of language primarily from the standpoint of form is called morphology ( Greek morphe , form ' ) . The study of language primarily from the standpoint of meaning is called semantics ( Greek sema , ' a sign ' ; semantikes ,  | ' significant ' ) . Other names for this branch of linguistics are semasiology ( Greek semasia , ' signification ' ) and signifies . We have reached , at this juncture , a partial understanding of what meaning must originally have been . The problem of meaning , in its entirety , is the newest branch of linguistics , and the one that to-day is undergoing the most intensive cultivation . It will throw needed illumination upon the other branches . Let us summarize ' the necessary conditions of communicative significance : Language , in its primitive function , says Malinowski , 7 is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than as a countersign of thought . " Man 's mind , Wells has said , serves the same purpose as the pig 's snout : it roots for the means of subsistence . Now , as Malinowski insists , " The structure of all this linguistic material is inextricably mixed up with , and dependent upon , the course of the activity in which the utterances are imbedded . . . . Language in its primitive forms ought to be regarded and studied against the background of human activities and as a mode of human behaviour in practical matters . We have to realize that language originally , among primitive , non-civilized peoples was never used as a mere mirror of reflected thought . " Sounds , in fact , do not begin to mean anything until they are found to possess a negotiable utility . How does this come about ? The word signification , in the sense of meaning , provides the central theme for development . To signify is to make a sign . A sign , moreover , to our eye-conscious civilization is something printed or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The spoken word , however , is no less a sign than any of these . A sound is uttered . It is a reflex response to an emotional stimulus .  | That sound is heard by another individual of the same species . This is important , because the hearer must , under similar conditions of heightened emotion , be capable of producing the same , or a similar , sound . It is only thus that the foundation of understanding is laid . The sound must have a distinct utility . It must serve pleasure or profit . It must , as one writer puts it , link A ( the crier ) and B ( the hearer ) in a common purpose . It must be simple and oft-repeated , so that it may form , together with the situations in which it naturally occurs , a lasting association . The precise order of these requirements is secondary in importance . Sound acquires meaning through vital associative reflexes . The dog , in the famous experiments of the Russian Pavlov , was first fed to the ringing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glands naturally began to excrete saliva . Later , when only the bell rang , and no food was forthcoming , his saliva flowed just the same . His reflex , in Pavlovian language , had been " conditioned . " Human intercourse is dense with such conditioning . Much of what we call onomatopoeia and interjection must , together with the imitative , ' imaginative , and social nature of man , have developed such conditioning from the repetitive and essential nature of the reflex . Once such primal meaning was achieved , the human habit of analogy would tend to multiply it a millionfold . The flesh becomes the word . The earliest language is somatic ; as it issues from , so it centers about , the body . It is physical ; it is , in the slow upbuilding of names and ideas , anthropo-centric , ego-centric , even what I call soma-centric . That is , it uses the species , the self , the body , as the central points of reference . Body , naturally , becomes one of our words for person , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body Comin ' through the rye .  | It turns , as naturally , into the pronouns somebody , nobody , anybody , everybody . Even the soul , the opposite of what body denotes , had at first to find bodily personification . Spirit , originally , refers to the air ; spirare is Latin for to blow , ' and is at the core of our words perspire , inspire , expire , respiration . . . . To expire is to breathe out ; to inspire is to breathe in . When we are inspired , a spirit has breathed power into us . When we speak of a poet 's divine afflatus we are speaking of his inspiration ; for afflatus is from Latin ad ( to , toward ) and flatus , from flare , another word meaning to blow . ' The root appears in our inflation , which may mean either to blow up tires or finances . Speaking of tires , the word pneumatic offers a pretty example of what can happen to the most noble of conceptions . The word is derived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' ; it is , therefore , breath or breathing . Like the words for air or wind in many tongues , it easily comes to mean soul or spirit , or even the vital principle . The noun pneumatic is defined as " a spiritual being , or one belonging to the highest of the three classes into which mankind was divided . " It is a term that belongs to Gnosticism . So , too , pneumatology defines not only pneumatics , or " the doctrine of air and other elastic fluids , " but the " Doctrine of the Holy Spirit . " The lungs , in classical Greek , are pneumones ; the relation of the word pneuma is evident . Hence pneumonia . Language is highly emotionalized . It is pragmatic ? intended to produce immediately useful results . It deals with the concrete . It is , par excellence , the socialization of the vocal organs . All these earthy traits of language will tend , under the influence of advancing civilization , to he obscured . Like solid foundations , none the less , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Without them the edifice could not have been built ; remove them , and the vast superstructure crumbles to dust . Without metaphor there could have been meaning . With- out it , however , language could never have developed into the formidable instrument that now enslaves , endangers , and yet exalts and magnifies humanity . The association of ideas is a winged steed that far outdistances Pegasus ; it easily eludes the reins of its rider . To change our mythological figure , metaphor is the true Proteus.  | LONG , INCOMPUTABLY LONG BEFORE METAPHOR WAS A FIGure of speech , it was a process , a habit , of thought . " Thought , " said Aristotle , " is metaphoric and proceeds by comparison , and the metaphors of language derive therefrom . " Metaphor , basically , means a carrying across , a transfer . Meta is Greek for after ' or across , ' and phorein is ' to bear ' ; trans is Latin for ' across , ' and fero , ' I bear . ' The principal parts of fero introduce new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' I bore ' ; latus sum , ' I have borne . ' A translation , then , is a carrying across ( i. e. , from one language to another ) . The German word Uebersetzung ( a setting over ) is constructed upon the same image . Translation , however , need not be restricted to carrying meanings across from one speech to another . We are forever translating the world to ourselves . When the little girl from the city , on her first visit to the country , caught sight of a cow and cried out , " See the horse ! " she was performing one of the fundamental acts of thinking : making a comparison between the known and the unknown . The Greeks provide the name for what we call a hippopotamus , which , literally translated , means a river-horse . ( Hippos , ' horse ' ; potamos , river . ' ) We laugh at the tiny lass who calls a cow a horse ; she quickly learned better . Yet the hippopotamus remains a river-horse . The leopard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' lion , '  | and pardos , tiger ' ) , named by the selfsame process that the little girl naturally employed : describing the unfamiliar in terms of the familiar . So , too , the Greek word for giraffe , was kamelopardalis ( kamelas , camel , ' and pardalis , leopard ' ) . Camelopard is poetic English for giraffe . Our ancestors discover new countries , and at once the countries are christened New England , Nova Scotia ( i. e. , New Scotland ) . Cities of the newly discovered lands are named New York , New Amsterdam . The new is linked to the old by a simple and obvious adjective . Continuity is thus established in a universe otherwise discontinuous . Our vocabulary always lags behind our inventions . The best that we could manage at first for the radio was wireless , because it was a kind of telephony without wires ; in the same way the automobile at first was the horseless buggy . So we have fireless cookers . We link the new with the old , the unfamiliar with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the only link we can discover is the absence of a distinctive element : fireless , horseless , wireless . Metaphorical expression is not only a means of identification and comparison ; it is a remarkable instrument of economy . Consider the word calculus , which is Latin for a pebble . ' Because we once reckoned with pebbles , the word calculus now names one of the most complicated systems of calculation : the differential calculus . The word includes , then , one of the simplest and one of the most intricate methods of reckoning . The process by which the word for a pebble can rise to the importance of a word that means so involved a system as the calculus is not at all simple ; yet it follows a natural metaphorical course in the human mind . There is , first , for our present purpose , the object and its name . There is , second , what is done with the object . There is , third , something that may resemble the object closely enough to be called by its name . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close as the first , yet not too remote . Then there are lesser resemblances , which taper off into associated ideas rather than direct resemblances.  | Observe that we are using the language of imagery . An idea , at first , was an image . When we speak to-day of ideas we are using a metaphor . When we say that a person has a good imagination , we mean that he is gifted with the power of creating and combining images , which represented thought long before language did , and much longer before writing did . The Chinese language , which is still written with a conventionalized form of images , provides interesting testimony to the manner in which the mind thinks by means of metaphors . Our own writing , to be sure , is also a conventionalized form of imagery , but the pictorial substance of the letters has almost thoroughly disappeared ; besides , our alphabet is phonetic ? made up of conventional symbols representing separate sounds , and not , like the Chinese characters , representing entire words . In our writing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the image has given the word . The Chinese for difference of opinion is an image that is read ni tung , wo si , and interpreted as " I east , thou west . " This has its simple , poetic beauty , and also a powerful linguistic effectiveness . One thinks , for a contemporary similarity , of the song , " Loch Lomond " : " Oh , yell tak ' the high road an ' I 'll tak ' the low road . " The imagery is similar in the Chinese locution and the Scotch ballad . Again , the Chinese for conversation is ni wen , we ta : " I asking , thou answering . " This has a direct Socratic appeal . It is almost too straightforward to be a metaphor , except that the Chinese language , especially in its written form , is literally composed of figures of speech ? drawings ( now conventionalized , but formerly quite recognizable ) that stand for talk . In our own language we have an expression that is applied to interchange of speech ( or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an image akin , in spirit , to the Chinese " I asking , thou answering . " The imagery of Egyptian hieroglyphics serves likewise to reveal the nature of metaphor as imagery , and the manner in which that imagery lends itself to change . The word htp means an offering mat . ' It is pictured by a rectangle I sur- mounted by a small circle ? thus : ! ? . The rectangle represents , as simply as may be , a mat , quite as a child would draw it . The circle is a cake , placed on the mat . We are not surprised to learn that this symbol means also conciliation . ' Let us pause , for a moment , upon the word conciliation and notice the different imagery behind the Egyptian and the Roman words . The essential idea behind conciliation is that of a council or concilium , a coming together for discussion , a meeting for planing away differences . When we are reconciled , we come together again after having been divided by differences . When we seek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of trying to win him over . The Latin word describes the action . The Egyptian image is more primitive , we may believe . It seems to say : " Let us be friends . See , here is a cake that I have brought for you ! " A step lower in human relations and we would have a bribe . Is it altogether a coincidence , men and women being what they are , that the word bribe also refers to something edible ? To be sure , it is merely French for a lump of bread , or the leavings of a meal ; but it is a gift to the appetite , and , under modern conditions it has become considerably more than a scrap of food . If you will look back at the crude symbol for offering mat and conciliation , and let your mind play about the suggestiveness of the drawing , you may think up other meanings that could be represented by it . This is precisely what the Egyptians did . One other meaning was " setting of the sun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the circle becomes the descending ball of fire . We have here , then , almost a visible illustration of how the mind , having created a simple image , makes multiple use of it to express the most unrelated concepts . Because Chinese writing still reveals , for all the changes that have come over it , a clear descent from image-drawing , it is especially useful at this point to impress certain facts about metaphors . The early Chinese pictogram ( or pictured repre- sentation ) of the sun was , like that of the Egyptians , a circle with a dot in the center . Now it has become something like . The circle has been squared , and the dot in the center has become a straight line across the box ; the result is called an ideogram , or the representation of an idea . The figure of man was originally such a drawing as a child might make of a human being : a circular head , two arms and two legs . The ideogram for man , as distinguished from the pictogram @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ average Chinese who makes use of these symbols in his daily writing does not know the original sources of his pictograms . A full course in Chinese etymology means not only a knowledge of the sounds of the language , and of the changes that have taken place in pronunciation , but also a knowledge of the changes that have taken place in the pictorialideographic representation of the words . Man is an image-maker . Recently , in a study of Shakespeare 's Imagery and What It Tells Us , Professor Caroline F. E. Spurgeon tried to reveal some of the inner qualities of Shakespeare 's mind by a study of the images in his writings . We may not " betray " ourselves in our imagery ? and surely we all make images , after our own fashion , whether we are poets or not ? but certainly we cast with our spoken or written imagery a certain illumination upon our deeper life , upon those interests that claim most of our vital attention . This is , to be sure , more true in the case of poets and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the street . The man in the street takes his images , like his language , and like too many of his opinions in general , ready-made . Much of his talk , like much of his thought , is merely a higher form of echoism . In  | any case , Professor Spurgeon 's study suggests perhaps a useful pursuit for students of language ? a study of early metaphors and the light that they may throw upon early thought . It is too easy to abuse such an investigation , and , for example , to deduce from the Latin and the Egyptian terms for conciliation a definite difference in the minds of these people . It may not be altogether accidental , on the other hand , that Shakespeare is full of images dealing with sports , with movement , with the body , with nature , with birds and , as the professor puts it , with " underdogs . " It is her preoccupation with metaphor , however , that at the moment concerns me . " For I incline to believe , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? which is the fact underlying the possibility and the reality of metaphor , holds within itself the very secret of the universe . " This , in itself , is a metaphorical way of writing . One may say that the more primitive a people , the more literally it feels its metaphors ; and the more sophisticated a people , the less vitality the metaphors possess as image . Language is a cemetery of dead metaphors , or , as Jespersen calls them , ex-metaphors . But dead metaphors are far from being dead words . The metaphor dies ; the word lives on , unmindful of its ancestry . In discovering identities and similarities , man naturally began with himself . Homo mensura is the Latin equivalent of the famous Greek pronouncement of Protagoras , pan ton chrematon metron anthropos : " man is the measure of all things . " This is yet another formulation of what is known as anthropomorphism . Man is the known , the familiar , by which the unknown and the unfamiliar begin to receive definition . Man 's mind works , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simile . Theoreticians have special terms for the type of comparison made . It is useful to know the 1 Page 8 of the work quoted in the text .  | terms , since they are employed in the teaching of language and in discussions of style . Nor do they , for all the imposing appearance that they present , involve any difficult ideas . They come , as do such words as metaphor , simile and analogy , under the general classification of tropes , which is to say , turns or figures of speech . The word trope is from the Greek , like so many other of our rhetorical terms . The Greeks laid the foundation of our grammatical writing ; it is therefore as natural to find Greek terminology in our discourses upon style as it is to find Italian terminology in our discourses upon music . Rhetoric is from rhetor , a teacher of oratory , ' which included not only skill in delivery but also skill in composition . According to one etymology , the word is derived from a root wer , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinction between grammar and rhetoric is that between mere correctness on the one hand and stylistic excellence on the other . In grammar we are concerned with matters of right or wrong ; in rhetoric we are concerned with the choice between good and better , between better and best . Trope is from the Greek for turn ( tropos ; tropein , ' to turn ' ) . The original word is turned from its proper meaning to a meaning allied in one way or another . Indeed , the precise manner in which the meaning is allied determines the classification of the trope , or figure . The trope called metaphor we have already examined at length . Two others , especially , claim our attention here : metonymy and synecdoche . Metonymy ( metd , suggesting change ' ; dnoma , name ' ) is a figure of speech in which one word takes the place of another by more or less logical suggestion . We say of a man that he is " a great hand " at building a fire ; we refer to a factory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a dear old soul . Synecdoche ( syn , with ' ; ek plus dechesthai , ' to receive ' ; therefore , ' to receive jointly ' ) is a trope or figure by which a part is made to stand for the whole , or the whole for a part .  | In more technical language , the species may thus stand for the genus , or the genus for the species . When we speak of sixteen summers having passed over the head of a maiden , we use summer in the sense of year ; we use a part for a whole . When we say that a person 's years have been embittered by poverty , we use years in the sense of life ? a part for a whole . When we call a miser a pinch-penny , we denote the genus ( miser ) by a specific type ( species ) . It will be seen that the distinction between metonymy and synecdoche is not really important . Every metonymy is a synecdoche ; every synecdoche is a metonymy . Recent practice has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term metonymy . Both , for that matter , represent a metaphorical habit of speech ; for all practical purposes , indeed , apart from the grammarian 's love for classifications , Metaphor may stand as the grand term to cover all examples of trope . To-day , when we suffer less than formerly from the primitive confusion between the real and the imaginary , metaphor and analogy are virtually alike . Whether we say of a strong man that he is an oak ( metaphor ) or that he is like an oak ( simile ; analogy ) we mean to express , and do express , not a sameness but a likeness . Technically speaking , a metaphor suggests identity , whereas a simile , or an analogy , represents a resemblance . Each of these figures of speech , of course , is based upon likeness added to literalness . Identity goes back to the Latin idem , the same . ' Simile is from another Latin word , similis , meaning like ' or similar . ' It is traced to the Sanskrit sama , the Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to English some , whether as an independent word or as the ending - some in such words as handsome . Thus , at bottom , identity and similarity revert to a fundamental significance of sameness . Analogy , from the Greek analogos , suggests proportionateness , according ' to ( and ) a ratio ' ( logos , that Greek word which has a wide and deep variety of meanings and connotations ) . When the poet writes , " Ocean , thou mighty monster ! " , likening the sea to a primitive beast , he creates a metaphor . He establishes , for the purposes of his emotional effect , an  | identity between the sea and the beast . The literal meanings of ocean and monster , respectively , are wide apart . The waters in their fury , however , suggest a resemblance to a monster in his fury ; to the literalness of the meanings , then , is added a perceived likeness . Heine , gazing upon the innocent child of his fancy , wrote : Du bist wie eine Blume Thou'rt like unto @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heine did not call the lass his flower ; he wrote that she resembled a flower ? she was like one . Actually , the terms of the comparison make little difference , except in the matter of style and of emotional effect . The metaphor perhaps reverts to an older type of perception . If you are driving through the country at twilight with a little girl at your side , and she catches sight of the moon in the sky , she cries out , " Oh , look ! The moon is chasing us ! " She does not exclaim , " Oh , look ! Does n't it appear as if the moon were pursuing us ? " She personifies the moon ; it becomes a creature of her own kind . Certainly it looks as if the moon were in pursuit of the automobile ; the child , in her innocence of nature and of language , translates the event into an identity . In much the same way , the primitive , gazing at the stormy ocean , could have regarded the phenomenon as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not like a monster ; it was one . We all know persons who cringe at the sound of a siren . . . . The word siren , as applied to the exceedingly un-siren-like horn of the automobile , or to the blood-curdling mechanism that warns of the approach of a fire-engine , is a metaphor ; it implies , perhaps not without conscious humor , an identity between the modern noise-maker and those sea nymphs against whose melodic allurements Odysseus stuffed the ears of his sailors with wax and had them lash him to the mast of his ship . There are many who , against the modern siren , but for a different reason , would gladly stuff their own ears with wax . The sound of the siren on the fire-engine or the police car  | affects the cringing listener by what might be called a physiopsychological metaphor . It sounds like some primal beast rushing in mad delight upon its prey . It rouses a reverberating train of associations . The intelligence of the listener knows well that the sound is caused by the rotation of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yell from what has been named , by trade euphemism , a siren . The emotions respond , however , as if the listener were the goal of this beast on a rampage . Through such experiences as these , some civilized persons ? perhaps the same uncontrolled temperaments who make a dash for the closet when it thunders ? can understand better than others the origin of metaphors in ancient life , far from the age of literature , from the categories of the instruction book . The metaphoric and analogic process affects nouns and verbs ? things and actions . A thing is , or is like , another thing ; a deed is , or is like , another deed . So deeply is this process embedded in language that , however conscious we may become of its presence , there are always evidences of its deeper penetration . The true meaning of the familiar statement that language is poetry ? that poetry came before prose ? that a more careful use of the tongue for scientific purposes must drain the speech of its emotional content and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflected the mind of primitive man ; it established on every hand living identities and living similarities ; words were the things for which they stood , and things , through resemblance or suggestion , became other things . Language and reality underwent a sort of interfusion . How long such a period may have lasted is both speculative and secondary ; what may be called the metaphorical epoch gave way , eventually , to the analogical . Man began to perceive that likenesses were not identities . The history of medicine shows a peculiar parallel to this transition in the history of thought . The old Latin adage , similia similibus curantur , bespoke the virtues of curing like with like . This principle , in modern medicine , is known as  | homeopathy ( Greek homoios , like , ' and pathos , suffering ' ; hence , the practice of curing by remedies that produce , in the healthy person , symptoms similar to those complained of by the patient ) . The curing of like by like , however , is older far than homeopathy . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slight resemblance to a man ; therefore , in the folk-lore of many nations , it has been regarded as a specific for barrenness in women . In the history of theology , too , we have record of an important battle that was waged over the difference between a metaphor and a simile , and that points behind grammar and verbal distinctions to the nature of the human mind . Homoousia ( pronounced homo-ousia ) and homoiousia ( likewise accented upon the ou of ousia ) have but an i of difference between them : literally an iota of difference . Yet that iota ( Greek for i ) split the world of the fourth century with controversy . Homos is Greek for same ; homoios is Greek for like ; ousia is Greek for substance , being , essence . The homoousian differed from the homoiousian in believing that the Son was of the same essence with the Father ? that he was co-substantial with Him ; the homoiousian believed that the Son was like , but not identical with , the Father . In the dissension we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dramatic afforded by history ? of the essential difference between one figure of speech and another . Man , as the measure of all things , measured himself against creation . That is , whatever he beheld he interpreted to himself in terms of himself . Life , in language as in thought , became an extension of his body . That is why we have so many somatic metaphors . ( Soma , Greek for body . ) This is such a natural process that we never think of it when speaking of the head of a table , the leg of a chair , the foot of a bed , the heart of a problem ( or the core , which is the same thing : Latin , cor , heart ' ) . We refuse to swallow a story ; we can not stomach certain persons or ideas ; we like men of our own kidney . Is there a part of the body that has not provided a word for  | the language ? Not only a word , but an entire vocabulary ? Think , without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head or foot . Many other words that contain such derived meanings will not occur to one untrained in linguistics , but they are there nevertheless . A chief is a head man . ( Latin caput , head , ' through the French , chef . ) A captain is also a head man ; the German word for captain reveals its derivation in terms more clear to the speaker of English : Hauptmann . In the same way , the Latin word for foot ? pes , pedis ? , which is cognate with the Greek pous , podos , appears in such derived meanings as pedestal , pedestrian , pedals , pedicure . From likening things to his own body , man proceeds naturally to the likening of things to other things . The process is an extension of the fundamental principle : to compare the unknown with the known . It is this that we have in mind when we say that without metaphor language could not have been . A may suggest B , B may suggest C , C suggests D , D suggests E @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however , all true resemblance to the original A may have disappeared . It is easy , for example , to see that a head of lettuce suggests a human head . The French word for head , tete , is from an intermediary word in the Latin of the common people , which was not at all like the classical Latin that we learn ? or at least study ? in school . The classical word caput , through such developments as chef , provided , for French , secondary meanings ; the word for head itself ? the portion of ourselves that rests upon our necks ? comes from testa , which meant , of all things , a pot . Evidently , it was at first just such a jocular metaphor as we have in mind when we speak of a man 's bean , or his coco ( short for coconut ) . We speak of the head of a pin ; we speak also of a pin-head , meaning one whose brains are of the size that would be containable in a head the size of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is , our power of making images ? to run riot , there is no telling where it will stop . In fact , it never stops . It is forever at the task of detecting and inventing new associations .  | Language is a veritable deposit of dead metaphors . As coal bears the imprint of the leaves that went , in ages past , to help convert vegetable energy into mineral energy ; as the various strata of the earth yield up , to human delving , evidence of civilizations that long since crumbled to dust ; as a palimpsest surrenders to the eye of the investigator inscriptions that lie concealed beneath other inscriptions , so does a word or a usage often reveal a living significance that died out in order that another , a related significance , might live . Let me offer the first example that comes to mind . The word economy comes from the Greek oikos , ' a house ' ( which is related to Latin vicus , ' a village ' ) , and nemein , ' to manage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that of a housekeeper ; in Greek , too , oikonomos meant ' housekeeper . ' From such a fundamental significance it was logical to extend the meaning so as to include management of any interest , however large . Economics thus comes to signify the study of the production , distribution and consumption of wealth . Such an extension implies an old metaphor ? the conception of the country and its government as a home . We still speak of our homeland . Few people , however , when using any of the words derived from oikonomos know , or need know , that its first element is from a Greek word for home . Nor need they know that such a word as domestic is derived from the Latin word for homedomus . Nor need they feel that in such a phrase as " domestic economy " they are really saying " home home-management . " The feeling of the home idea in domestic is still strong ; the feeling of the home idea in economy is , for all but linguists , atrophied . Words for home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far from home , indeed . Because so much of primal language material becomes atrophied , it is possible to go on speaking without an uncomfortable awareness of the elements that went to make up the  | words we use . Frequently , in fact , the difference between what we call a mixed metaphor and an acceptable form of speech is determined by such awareness or lack of such awareness . By such analogies as we can think of , it would appear that our remote ancestral speech was a distinctly slower process than later enunciation . Thought and mental imagery must have been correspondingly hazy and slow . Since sight is a much more primitive faculty than that of developed speech , we must ? as a species ? have seen long before we really spoke . Certain rude classifications , in fact , especially of shape or color , must have been suggested to the eye ( that is , to the consciousness , through the eye ) far in advance of their recognition by language . It is questionable whether , to the primitive mind in its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consciousness of metaphor than there is in us when we say that " the kettle boils , " or when we speak of a " disaster . " Just as , in our imagined beginnings , we distinguished hazily between dream and reality , so we did not distinguish between reality and that imagery , that picturization , called metaphor . All metaphor implies , as all dreaming implies , imagery . In dreams we not only see ; we say , as well . Just what we say is not here the question . The process , however , has linguistic connotations ; Freud finds that wit and dreams reveal a striking similarity of technique . Metaphor is a kind of spoken picture . A Brazilian poet calls a volume Sounding Canvases . The mixed metaphor is , from its very construction , a late development . It could not occur until the pictorial element in a given phrase or locution had faded into indistinctness . The juxtaposition of two incongruous word-pictures serves to bring back strikingly the faded images and to render the words for the nonce graphic once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the more one sees that language contains thousands of mixed metaphors ; these remain unquestioned only because the images have been forgotten , or have faded beyond restoration .  | I am concerned , for the moment , with the metaphorical , therefore the imaginal , element in what we must consider primitive speech to have been . There are interesting collateral speculations . According to psychoanalysis , and not to this theory alone , dream-imagery is a pictorial language . By means of these seemingly incongruous dream-images the dreamer is making a statement that has to be translated into the spoken language much as the Rosetta Stone had to be deciphered . Dreaming is a complication of metaphors . I am aware that the primitive , especially our imaginary prelingual primitive , must have dreamed different images from those that we dream . My dreams and yours are often determined by our speech-habits ; they exhibit condensations ( like Lewis Carroll 's so-called " portmanteau words " ) and other charade-like processes . What is important at this stage is the ancient nature of imagery in man 's waking and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dreams are riots of mixed metaphors , and must have been even more riotous in the prelingual era . Not for nothing does I see mean I understand . ' Sight , among the senses , easily predominates as a synonym for comprehension . " Seeing is believing . " To step for a moment across the boundaries of our discussion , symptoms of nervous ailments frequently adopt a metaphorical character , in that they point to an organ that is not at the root of the trouble . How much , for example , are the heart and the stomach metaphorically abused by hypochondriacs . This misunderstanding of symptoms early found its way into language . I develop , together with a persistent case of insomnia , a wracking pain in the left instep . It seems so definitely organic that I begin to fear bone-rotting , gangrene , amputation . I point to the spot and say to the physician , " My instep hurts terribly . " The doctor , after X-ray examination , assures me that the bone is not involved . My nerves are deceiving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly feels as if my instep were being crucified . " With that as if , and the new knowledge it connotes ,  | I have progressed from metaphor to simile ? from the establishment of a false identity to the enlightened awareness of a similarity . Life , more than we realize , is no less than language a combination of similes ? Vaihinger 's Philosophie des Als Ob , the philosophy of as if ? and metaphor . We can not hope to grasp ? and even then , imperfectly ? more than that restricted segment of reality which immediately concerns us . Vast areas remain beyond the perception of our senses . We live , as language lives , by vital fictions . In a deep sense , reality is the greatest metaphor that the human mind has ever conceived . And it will be useful to remember that at bottom all that reality means is thingness . The highest flights of language carry us but a very short distance from our body , its material functions and its material surroundings . The everlasting wonder is that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dizzying altitudes . Language can not escape aestheticism and imagery , not even when it congeals into the symbols of mathematics . For those symbols are , as letters of the alphabet , themselves congealed and abstracted images.3 Certainly one of the worst mixed metaphors in any language is to be found quoted by Erdmann in his excellent book Die Bedeutung des Wortes ( The Meaning of the Word ) . " Der Zahn der Zeit , der schon so manche Trane getrocknet  | hat , wird auch fiber diese Wunde Gras wachsen lassen . " I translate it literally : " The tooth of Time , which already has dried so many tears , will also let the grass grow over these wounds . " It is worth while analyzing this small catalogue of catachresis ( catachresis , accented on the marked vowel , is Greek for misuse ' ; it is applied to figures of speech in which words are wrongly used for other words , as in mixed metaphors ) . " The tooth of Time , which has dried so many tears . . . " Time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likened to a huge monster with teeth that eat up existence . Time also dries tears ? that is , with the passing of time , our griefs are softened . In this section of the badly mixed metaphor , Time , without notice , is transformed from a toothed monster to a long period over which tears are wiped away , as by a kindly hand . " To let the grass grow over " anything is to allow time to pass . But teeth ( " the tooth of Time " ) do not let " grass grow " over anything , especially over wounds . Nor does grass grow over wounds in the first place . Time , in the way that it dries tears , also heals wounds . But not by bandaging them with grass . The mixed metaphor is , as the name indicates , really a combination of metaphors in which the amalgamation is noticeably incomplete . Dr. Friederich Polle , in a collection of metaphorical curiosities , 4 quotes a confusion of color . " Wenn die Blaubeeren noch griin sind , sehen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Literally this reads , " When blueberries are still green , they look red ; when they are ripe , they are black . " Green , of course , here stands for unripe . How much different is it when we speak of " the height of the depression , " or hear a child cry out , " The airplane is landing in the water ! " Everyday , on the radio , it is possible to hear such metaphorical melanges as " screen scoops flashed to you from the  | heart of Hollywood . " It is questionable whether one hearer in a thousand feels any greater sense of incongruity here than when he reads that " there has been rioting in the heart of Paris . " It is not only questionable : on the whole it may be fortunate . Almost as bad as the examples from Erdmann and Polle are the examples quoted by Vendryes in a work that should be much better known ( this applies also to students ) than it is.5 " To navigate the car of State over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind . It is hard to believe , too , that anyone could soberly describe a debutante as a " budding star who already sings with a master hand . " Frenchmen say , without the approval of their more exacting countrymen , such things as " embracing a career , " or " enjoying bad health . " But they also say ? and their usage is paralleled by our own ? that they " arrive " at a certain place . Arrive , traced back to its beginnings in Latin , means to reach a river-bank , and if we had remained conscious of that derivation from the earliest days , we should have felt now the incongruity of arriving anywhere else than on the other side of a stream . One of the troubles with purists in language is that they do remain too conscious of such origins . In the seventeenth century , Vendryes reminds us , certain purists of the Academy insisted that you could not fermer ( shut ) a door . They wanted France to say pousser la Porte ; fermer was allowable for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . Such an attitude toward language would , like any other type of purism carried to logical extremes , serve to paralyze speech . For these are catachreses ; he calls them cacologies . ( Greek , kakos , bad , ' and logos , speech ' or expression . ' ) To be too conscious of linguistic origins would be to detect , in every other word , a cacology . Fortunately for humanity , it can forget , and forget not only words .  | How much of a catachresis or cacology is the familiar example taken from Shakespeare 's Hamlet ? " To take arms against a sea of troubles . . . ? " Originally , to arm oneself ' ( Latin armare ) signified to cover the shoulder . The plural , arm a , signifies what we mean by arms ? protective or offensive weapons . In the history of South American independence there is a famous episode in which a band of llaneros , or plainsmen , in the ardor of combat rushed into the ocean on horseback , lances raised , against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of taking arms against a sea of troubles ! Now , according to Aristotle , Strabo , and other writers , the Celts of old had a similar custom . " They throw themselves into the foaming floods with their swords drawn in their hands . " 8 Shakespeare may have known far better than the generality of his commentators . Nevertheless , our ignorance of the sources upon which he drew for his imagery renders us insensitive to the truth of such metaphors as these . Reading the soliloquy of Hamlet to-day , and coming upon this passage , we are rather reminded of the story of King Canute and his foredoomed attempt to sweep back the waves of the ocean . Far more reprehensible than Shakespeare was the college professor who , lately reviewing a book , wrote of it in the heat of enthusiasm that it was " the greatest story of a flood since Genesis . It has all succeeding floods laid by the heels . " Just as language is full of excellent metaphors so well assimilated that we have lost all consciousness of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ metaphors many of which analysis would reveal to be badly mixed . We say , for example , that a fire has been extinguished . Extinguere , in classical Latin , had the meaning of putting out a fire or a flame . When , to-day , we speak of a species as being extinct , we do not think of the species as having been put out like a light . The first meaning of extinguere , however , even  | in Latin , was not to put out a fire . It was to blunt the edge of an arrow . The process of mind that compared the blunting of an arrow to the putting out of a flame may be guessed at , especially when one thinks of the tongues or arrows of flame . There is a sense in which all metaphors are mixed , at first . So , too , the word obliviscor , in Latin , means ' I forget . ' It is akin to our word oblivion . There was an earlier meaning , however : ' to fade , ' ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a book , or the leaves of a tree . Obliviscor , then , compares the mind to a page that , with the passing of time , fades away . Early metaphors could hardly be felt as mixed because the feeling of identity was powerful . The sun was a ball of fire sinking into the flood . The star was a " shooting " star . The perception of a mixed metaphor or of a mixed expression suggests an advanced stage of linguistic awareness , an ability to analyze . Consider this sentence from John Dos Passos ' novel The Big Money : Doris says to George Duquesne , " Charley was one of our star aces . " The contemporary reader appreciates the expression without trouble . He knows that Doris is praising Charley as one of the country 's foremost aviators . That star , from its status as a noun , has become an adjective , need not concern us now . Both star and ace have come to mean , in English , prominent representatives of a profession or activity . A great actor or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brilliance of a star in the heavens . An ace did not always mean the highest representative of a calling . In fact , one of the definitions found in the dictionary is that of " a very small quantity or degree . " Originally ( Latin as , assis ) it stood for unity , a unit of coinage , and the coin so minted . One is a small number ; but to be " number i " in a list is to be the first , and therefore to lead . The ace , in cards , is in many games the card of highest value . So that ace acquires a connotation of leadership , of primacy , of uniqueness . Here , then , we have two words , star and ace , the one associated with the sky and the other with coinage ; only later did  | the second become a name for a card with a single spot upon it . Each acquires a connotation of excellence , of outstanding significance . Each gradually loses some of its original force . In the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word star even loses its noun force , and becomes a mere modifier for aces . It is most likely that Doris , speaking these words to Duquesne , felt not the slightest vestige of the metaphors implied in her words . This is , especially for prose , the normal course of events . Many a person opens his newspaper and reads without any sense of incongruity that a sale of " American Orientals " is being held . The noun oriental has ceased , or half-ceased , to mean a rug woven in the Orient ; it has come to mean a rug of a certain design and coloring . When American manufacturers adopt that design and coloration , the Oriental becomes indeed American . In the same way , not everyone feels a sense of incongruity when he attends what has been advertised as a " midnight matinee . " Matin is French for morning ' ; matinee regularly applies to a performance given in the afternoon ; a midnight matinee , then , if read literally , would mean some such nonsense as " a morning-afternoon performance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a contradiction as midnight matinee acceptable without demur by a theatrical public ? Matinee was at first the opposite of soiree . Soir is French for evening , and a soiree is an evening reception . Matinee , then , readily came to stand for any reception or performance given in the daytime . As such , it became the opposite of evening performance . As such , also , it readily came to mean any performance except that of the regular evening one . A midnight matinee is thus easily understandable , though one questions whether careful usage would sanction it . There is a similar confusion with the musical terms serenade and aubade . The first of these words has become familiar English . Few associate it with the French word soir in its Italian form sera . Technically speaking , a serenade is a musical salutation played in the open , for ladies , at night . The  | Italian form is serenata ; our form comes from the French , as does aubade . A serenade , then , etymologically and historically , is essentially an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or , to be more precise , a dawn-piece . Aube is French for dawn , ' being derived from Latin alba , which in turn derives its meaning of dawn from the characteristic whiteness or brightness of daybreak . The alb of the priest is so named because it is a full-length ecclesiastical vestment usually of white linen . So easily , in the case of such words as aubade , is the etymological and historical meaning of the word forgotten , that Webster 's New International Dictionary , after indicating the character of the aubade as " a piece of music to be performed or sung at dawn , " adds the second definition , " an open-air morning serenade . " Literally interpreted , " morning serenade " would be a " morning evening-piece , " which sounds formidably like a catachresis . It is but a step removed from " midnight matinee , " but that step is an important one . In the case of the midnight matinee many of us are quite conscious of the incongruity ; the expression is still felt to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other hand , are not felt with such opposing force as are matinee and midnight . Gasc 's French Dictionary , for example , likewise defines aubade as a " morning serenade . " The word serenade appears to have all but lost its relationship to evening ; what is left is the idea of a musical salutation . I doubt that it would occur to anyone to define a serenade as an evening aubade . Perhaps that is because the more familiar word established itself earlier ; serenades , in fact as well as in etymology , go better with twilight . As we hear of " musical soirees on Sunday morning , " of " morning serenades " and " midnight matinees , " so we read , even in Ivanhoe , of " morning vespers . " Vespera is Latin for evening , ' and is akin to Greek hesperos and perhaps our word West . Vespers are evening prayers . But even the Church interprets the term freely , since some churches have afternoon vespers.  | In the first issue of a new magazine , in an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I come upon this phrase : " In December , 1936 , after a veritable carnival of disaster . . . " Certainly the writer felt no incongruity in his words , else he would not have set them down . Let us break the words into their original images . A carnival is so named because it is a feast that takes place before Lent ; at that time meat is abstained from . Latin for ' meat ' is caro ; the Italian word is carne . One explanation of the term regards the - vale element as signifying ' good-bye , ' or ' farewell ' ? i. e. to meat . ( Latin , vale , as in the phrase , Ave atque Vale , ' Hail and Farewelll ' ) A less fanciful etymology is that of carnelevale , or the putting away of meat . ( Latin , levare , ' to raise ' or ' take away ' ; for , when we lift an object , we take it away from its position . ) In any case , the word suggests a temporary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then ? Because of the high spirits associated with the observance . Nobody , to-day , thinks of the meaty origin of the word , unless he be a churchman or a philologist . I have heard a radio announcer , advertising a restaurant , inviting his listeners to " a carnival of steaks . " This was almost as incongruous as " a veritable carnival of disaster . " The word disaster we may pass with little comment ; almost everybody interested in words knows that it means an unfavorable star , and that it goes back to the superstition that stars influence destinies . Unfortunately , astrology is still attractive to certain sections of the public . In such phrases as " a carnival of crime " there is a certain justification for the use of the noun carnival . It suggests riotous pleasure , and , by a slight extension , can be applied to malicious or sadistic pleasure ; the connotation of transgressing bounds is already present . A " carnival of disaster , " on the other hand , applies the noun to events that are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one word suggestive of pleasure and another suggestive of grief . Far more  | metaphors than we realize are mixed metaphors ; metaphors such as these , however , emphasize by unfortunate juxtaposition the violence of the mixture . Prose is , and necessarily , saturated with poetry . It is , as has often been said , fossilized poetry . This is another way of saying that it is composed largely of dead metaphors and similes , of dead analogies . What is the most prosaic element in modern life ? It would be hard to give an absolute answer , but most people , perhaps , would answer that it was money and the pursuit of material gain , as distinguished from the more spiritual aspects of the higher living . What , then , could be more prosaic than the language of a stock company , with its annual report , its assets and liabilities , its surpluses and deficits ? Yet , so poetic is the substratum of language that even in this vocabulary of the market-place is to be discovered a deep residuum of figurative language @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this commercial activity revolves . To discover its origin one must turn to a classical dictionary and look up the entry Juno . Offhand , it seems silly that the word for money should come to us from a Greek goddess . Investigation , however , makes the mystery clear . Juno was a goddess with many attributes . Her name , in its earlier form , Jovino , is a feminine form of Jove . She was worshiped in numerous forms , especially in Italy , as the queen of womankind . She was Juno Lucina , that is , the bringer of light ; she was Juno Sospita , the savior ; she was Juno Quiritis , armed with a spear ; she was Cinxia , she who tied and untied the marriage girdle ; she was Pronuba and Iuga , goddess of marriage ; as the wife of Jupiter she was Juno Regina . And , directly to our purpose , she was Juno Moneta , the admonisher , occupying a temple on the Capitol , dedicated to her out of gratitude for her helpful monitions . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mint ,  | and called moneta , in Latin , because it was minted in the temple of Juno Moneta . Thus our word money , derived from moneta , comes from the Latin word for admonishment . The word mint , of course , is one of the forms evolved from moneta , through the Anglo-Saxon mynet . Moneta , from the verb monere , ' to admonish ' or ' warn , ' is akin to English mind , which , in its kinship with Old High German minna , meaning ' memory of love ' ( Minnesinger , ' singer of love songs ' ) , brings in a new train of associations that carries us far indeed from the love of money . So much for that which has been stigmatized , erroneously , as the root of all evil . ' Let us investigate the original meanings of the other commercial words and phrases : annual report , assets and liabilities , company , and see how impregnated they , too , are with the poetry of things . Annual report . Report is relatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in turn , is the prefix re , signifying repetition in time or space , and portare , ' to bring ' or ' bear . ' A porter is one who bears ; a reporter is one who brings back news . Porter is still literal in meaning ; reporter is figurative . The report is what is brought back . Annual is far more poetic . Annus is Latin for ' year ' ; annualis means ' yearly . ' Annus itself , however , meant in Latin ' a ring ' ; in French , the word is anneau , from the Latin anulus or annulus . The year was the ring or round of the seasons . Assets is the French assez , ' enough , ' from the Latin ad satis . Satis is discernible in our satisfaction . Satis is akin to Gothic saths , meaning ' full . ' Liabilities are obligations ; in both these words , the essential idea is that of being bound . Liable is from Latin ligare , ' to bind ' ; so is the second element of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bandage . A ligament is something that binds , especially in the body . Less obvious derivatives of the same Latin root are league , a binding of groups or nations ; they who are thus bound are allies ; allies  | is etymologically linked to league , ligament , ligature , and all words containing the element lig , as obligation . Allies , incidentally , was during the Great War the most frequently mispronounced word in the language ; the accent , whether for verb or noun , is on the final syllable . If we were concerned , at the moment , with pronunciation rather than with etymology , we might make out a case for the mispronunciation . The natural instinct of the speaker is to make an accentual distinction between nouns and verbs that sound alike . We make progress ( noun ) and thus progress ( verb ) . The noun commonly accents the early syllable ; the verb accents the later . In the case of ally the rule does not hold . Ally is derived ultimately from Latin ad and ligare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the 1 of adligare were assimilated to one another ) gives in French allier , whence our word is taken . As to why the g should disappear in the evolution from Latin to French , such changes comprise a study in itself , and we shall know much more about it when we come to the consideration of linguistic change . To have a liability , then , is to be bound to someone . It is not pleasant , but it is a poetic usage . So , for that matter , is the word bond in the phrase stocks and bonds ; it is the same word as band , in the sense of a fastening ; for a bond , too , is an obligation . It binds . As for surplus and deficit , they are less exciting as words than as facts . Deficit is Latin for ' it is wanting ' ; it is the third person singular present indicative of the Latin verb deficere . It is obviously akin to such of our words as defect , deficiency , and so on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and plus more . ' Company , however , brings us back to poetry . Companion , originally , was the one who ate bread with you : Latin cum , with , ' and pan is , bread . ' From such a circumstance the derived meaning of association grows inevitably . It is all but impossible to trace to its origins any word , even the most seemingly prosaic , without realizing how much it has been altered by the figurative habits of the human mind . Inevitably , through words , we effect a metaphorical transfor- mation of reality . Words are a way of turning reality to our private ends , of holding it in suspension , of toying with it , of experimenting with it , of remolding it ? if only in imaginaton nearer to the heart 's desire .

" " For more than forty years I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hardly as important as Columbus ' ; it satirized the delight , and the false sense of power , with which all of us learn a highsounding name for the things we have been doing all our lives . A more important discovery is the fact that all our lives , whether as individuals or as the human race , we have been talking poetry without knowing it .  | THE LIFE OF THE PRIMITIVE WAS SATURATED WITH magic . His magic was a form of mysticism , for it was bound up with everything that occurred . It was bred of ignorance , of insecurity , of the superstition that all things , animate or inanimate , were endowed with potency for evil or for good . The word , to one who did not know writing and experienced it only as utterance , naturally shared in this potency . Evidence of this power is to be found in the history of words themselves . There are few words in the language , even to-day , that ring with more mysterious suggestion than the word Fate . It connotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all that it signifies is " that which has been spoken , " from Latin fari , to speak . ' The simple fact of capitalizing the word seems to  | add to the magical effect . This is part of the symbolism of writing , of course . The plural of fatum , which gives us the word fate , is fata ; it gives us these strange figures , the Fates , named in Greek mythology Clotho ( the spinner ) , Lachesis ( the disposer of lots ) and Atropos ( she who snips the thread that Clotho has spun , and of which Lachesis has determined the length ) . When we are able to perceive the Fates as merely the personification of a Latin neuter plural , we have gone a far journey from the days when magic was magic , and not simply a word derived from another plural . Magic comes from the Persian ; the Greek singular is magos , whence the Latin magus , plural magi . The Magi were priests of ancient Medea and Persia , and later practised sorcery . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , become the " wise men , " who , like the Fates , are three in number . From the conception of Fate and the Fates we derive the conception of the creatures who execute the dictates of Fate . ( Dictates is another word derived from a term for saying : Latin dictatio , ' saying , ' based upon dicere , ' to say . ) A fairy is a minor fate ; the word , like its poetic doublet fay , is one of the Fate-group . Fata Morgana , that renowned figure of the medieval romances , is another . At first the name of Morgan le Fay ( i. e. , Morgan the fairy or sorceress ) , it became naturally the name of a mirage that was caused supposedly by her necromancy . The connection between such terms as fame , fable , and fate ? all of them deriving from the word fari , to speak ' ? is obvious . A fable ( Latin tabula ) is something told often , now , with the intention of deceiving . Fame is common @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two concepts that the average youth can not easily associate with one another , they are glamour and grammar . Yet these are , in origin , the same word . How does it come that so unglamorous a subject as grammar gives us also so ungrammatical a subject as glamour ? First let us note that the word grammar itself is related ultimately to the Greek gramma , which means a letter ' ? a writ- ten character . Graphein , in Greek , means ' to write ' ; it is the central term that provides us with such endings as gram in telegram , or graph in phonograph ? with such words as graphic , graphomania ( a craze for writing ) , and graphite ( a carbon that is useful for writing ) . Glamour is a Scotch corruption of grammar . The interchange of 1 and r is one of the commonplaces of speech in many parts of the world . The Chinese ' melican for American points to a national phonetic trait . There is a tendency , also , for duplicated consonants in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dissimilation ? that is , the making of similar consonants into dissimilar ones . The first r of grammar , then , may have been dissimilated into the 1 of glamour . This would account for the changed pronunciation of the word . We have not yet explained , however , the changed meaning . There is an uncommon English word , gramarye , or gramary , which comes to us from the French grammaire ( grammar ) , in the sense of magic , enchantment , or necromancy ( black art ) . The connection between one and the other is really simple . For , granted that words , whether pronounced or written , have power for evil or good , the term that means the writing down or the ordering of words could easily become a term that means such an inherent power . It is the more understandable , then , why the notions of grammar and of magic should be so closely associated . The French grimoire , which is a cousin-word to our own gramarye , means a conjuring book . ' It means @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art of the law . " Entendre or savoir le grimoire ( that is , to understand ' or know one 's conjuring book ' ) is equivalent to our " being up to snuff , " to understanding the intricacies of the law . This is interesting for its comparison of the law to magic and of both to unintelligible writing and speech . Magical formulas , from the first , were not , and perhaps were not meant to be , any more intelligible than the answers of the Delphian Oracle . And certainly , as the commoner has seen with fine percipiency , the formulary writings  | of the legal profession are not always free of inheritances from the days of magic.2 In the casting of spells , not only the magical power of the words that compose the formula is of importance ; the order of the words must , under severe penalty , be observed . Thus , not only the vocabulary figures , but the syntax , the grammar . The grammar becomes an essential feature of the spell . The precise order of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that accompany them . A misplaced word , like a deed out of turn , invalidates the magic , and may even bring down death upon the clumsy officiant . It is from such formal rigidity as this , indeed , that grammar is supposed to have arisen . The Hindus , for example , were exceedingly careful about the sacred words that they pronounced in reading their sacred writings . They believed , just as did any savage medicine man , that if a word were incorrectly used , or incorrectly pronounced , the object of their religious sacrifices would be frustrated , or even bring about harmful consequences . " This solicitude for the sacred texts , " writes Holger Pedersen , " gave the first impulse to the study of grammar , which was subsequently applied to secular literature . " 8 The noun spell , employed as a designation of a magic formula , affords additional evidence of the power that is concentrated into words . Its original meaning is that of ' a recital ' or ' a tale . ' ( Gothic , spill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter to build such derived meanings as ' idle talk ' or , in another direction , ' sermon . ' ( Latin sermo means simply ' talk ' or ' discussion ' ; our word sermon is a specialized significance . ) The verb spell ( from the Germanic stem spell- ) meant at first to read letter by letter , as one to whom reading  | was unfamiliar would do . It is easy to imagine that when writing was a new invention , reading came to most persons with a certain difficulty , and that it was , as articulate talking itself must have been in prehistoric times , a laborious process . Talking is still , to many , not at all a smooth and simple activity ; reading , to many more , is still a more or less disguised spelling . From meaning ' to read , ' the verb spell naturally took on the meaning ' to charm , ' or ' bewitch ' ? i. e. , ' to act as a spell . ' We speak , in this country , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listeners in a spell . Between oratory ( the genuine type as well as the spurious ) and magic there is a relationship . The orator is as little averse as is the sorcerer to summon up the musical and the magical potency of words . The original meaning of the noun spell is concealed in the term Gospel , which , before it took on the suggestion of God 's spell was probably good spell , which is to say good , or glad , tidings . Since these glad tidings ( a phrase that in our more colloquial moments we translate as ' good news ' ) concerned the coming of Christ and the Kingdom of God , the Gospel came to mean the entire doctrine that comprised these elements . From this it came , by a familiar process of language and of thought , to stand for any doctrine . To-day , we might even speak of the gospel of an atheist without suggesting very strongly an incongruous mixture . One of the numerous definitions of a spell is an enchantment . This word , like its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of song in magic . Charm is from the Latin carmen , which means a ' song ' ; the ch shows that the word comes to us through the French . Doubtless the heroine of Bizet 's best-known opera received her name because of the fatal charm that she exercised . Nomen omen runs the Latin saw : ' the name is an omen . ' This had , however , a deeper significance than appears in translation . Incantation and enchantment are two forms of the same word , each based upon the Latin cantus , a ' song ' or ' chant . ' Incantation , in origin , is Latin ; enchantment comes directly  | from the French . Every chant is a song , but not every song is a chant . Into the word chant has been sung , by generations of spell-weavers , a haunting connotation of magic , mystery , and religion . A cantor is not only a singer ; he is the singer in a church , usually the leader of a church choir . Among the Jews , cantor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ translation is precentor ( Latin prce- , before , ' and canere , to sing ' ) because the precentor is one who leads in the congregational singing . The French feminine form for singer is chanteuse , which is derived from the same Latin words that give us cantor ; but a chanteuse is hardly a female cantor or precentor . Circumstances alter cases ? and words . Song , then , or melody , was one of the inevitable accompaniments of spells . To be enchanted was to be song=bound , just as to be bewitched was to be spell-bound . Die schonste Jungfrau sitzet Dort oben wunderbar , Ihr gold'nes Geschmeide blitzet , Sie kiimmt ihr goldenes Haar . Sie kdmmt es mit goldenem Kamme , Und singt ein Lied dabei , Das hat eine wundersame , Gewaltige Melodei . It is the eternal enchantress , the Lorelei , whose " powerful melody " so fascinates the boatman that he goes to disaster upon the rocks . Und das hat mit ihrem Singen Die Lorelei getan . See , then , how once more the feminine form of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its masculine counterpart . The Lorelei was an enchantress , which is a chanteuse . The song of the cantor rises in devotion to the spirit ; the song of the enchantress is sung in praise of , or to the ruin of , the flesh . At the core of both meanings , however , is the song , the cantus as a source of power , of fascination , of compulsion , of magic . One more etymology may suffice to reveal how closely asso- ciated in the minds of our ancestors was the conception of speech with that of craft in magic . The word rune , which is much the same in Irish , German , Anglo-Saxon , English , and other tongues , anciently meant speech ' or language . ' A more familiar meaning is that of secret , ' especially with reference to the use of secret formulas for magical purposes . If , then , words seem to have the power of materializing that which they stand for ; if to pronounce a name is to summon the bearer of that name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run the danger of exposing oneself to them ; if words have " life , " then it is reasonable to fight words with words . Some such reasoning must have dictated the custom of changing words , just as names had been changed in order to deceive one 's enemies , and one 's chief enemy , the Angel of Death . If the name was an omen ( nomen omen ) , to avoid the name was to avert the omen . Absit nomen , absit omen , as it were . Absit omen was an expression used by the Latins to express the pious wish that no evil omen might attend the use of a word or an expression . It is the equivalent of the equally superstitious expression , " May no evil eye gaze upon our happiness and thus destroy it . " The depreciation of one 's possessions or of oneself , as is ceremonially practised in China , was doubtless begun by primitive souls who intended thus to avert the envious attention of the gods . The form , like so many other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your humble servant , " we feel not a jot of humility or servitude . It is simply ceremonial self-depreciation . In the same way , to call an evil thing good is to invoke the power of words to alter matter and circumstance . To this process has been given the technical name euphemism , from the Greek eu , well , ' and phenai , to speak . ' Euphemizein , in Greek , is to use words of good omen . ' All languages are saturated with euphemisms ; so deeply , in fact , that often we have to be reminded that we employ them . The obvious term for the  | opposite of the euphemism ? that is , for calling good things bad , in an effort to avert the envy of the gods , or otherwise to discredit them ? is cacophemism . ( Greek kakds , bad . ' ) A classic instance of euphemism occurs in the Greek word for left , as distinguished from right . The regular words were laios and skaios , akin , respectively , to Latin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " worse " side , the Greeks deliberately named it the " better " ? that is , aristeros . ( Aristocracy , the rule of the best element . ) After a time , however , even this euphemism wore off , and the left side became euonumos , of which the literal translation is the good name , ' or the good omen . ' Even the left wing of an army was called to euonumon , the side of the good omen or good name . There is nothing indirect or subtle about this euphemism . In so many words it calls the evil thing good , and thus hopes to make it so . Euphemisms abound on every side , so thickly that we forget they are there . When a shop calls itself a shoppe it is employing what might be called orthographical euphemism ; the archaic spelling seems to lend dignity or quaintness , as the case may be . When a firm names its wares " Good Luck " products , it is either trading upon the suggestiveness of the words , or is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When the manufacturer of Pig 's Pancreas was advised to change that name to pepsin gum , he yielded to a very sensible suggestion . Even to ourselves we seem more humane when we liquidate our enemies instead of killing them ; when we place persons in protective custody instead of imprisoning them ; when we tell an untruth , or a falsehood , or a fabrication , instead of a downright lie . A book could be written on the human objection to being called , in plain language , a liar . Yet man habitually lies to others and to himself , and perhaps he is most the liar when , having been called one , he bristles and challenges his accuser to a duel . What he is offering to fight about is not the fact of his truthfulness having been questioned , but the specific word that has been used to describe his aberrancy from the facts . Lie and liar are " fighting words . "  | Perhaps one of the most dubious triumphs of the human mind occurred in 1937 and 1938 , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Spain , when men , women and children were being slaughtered by missiles from ocean , earth and sky , and yet ? no war was going on . For war , in so many words , had not been declared . It is to be doubted that the innocent slain appreciate this delicate diplomatic distinction . The Latin mens ( mind ) gives the verb mentiri , which originally meant ' to use the mind . ' We have the suggestion in the word mentation . It is a commentary upon the uses to which man has put his mind that mentiri came to mean ' to lie . ' We have that suggestion , too , in our word mendacious . When political factions label each other by such names as reds or economic royalists , they are using cacophemism . They are " giving the dog a bad name . " They are employing , deliberately , names with reservoirs of hostile emotional content . The fox who called the inaccessible grapes sour was using a form of the same technique . The mother who fondly pats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employing yet another form of cacophemism , with deliberate humorous intent . As euphemism is motivated by fear , so cacophemism of this sort may be but an inverted expression of love . Between such devices as euphemism and circumlocution there is a psychological relationship . A circumlocution is a round-about way of expressing one 's meaning . ( Latin , circum , ' around , ' and loqui , ' to speak . ' ) It is equivalent , frequently , to what is called " beating about the bush . " A circumlocution is thus also a paraphrase . ( Greek Para , ' beside , ' and phrdzein , ' to speak ' ; that is , to say the same thing in other words . ) Every euphemism is , in a sense , a circumlocution , but not every circumlocution is a euphemism . In order to be a true euphemism a word or phrase must call an evil thing by a good name , in the hope of thus transforming the evil into good . Euphemism is based upon superstition , whereas circumlocu- tion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a desire to escape the commonplace . Nevertheless circumlocution renders almost as much tribute to the magic in words as does euphemism , and often it conceals the superstitions or fears upon which euphemism is founded . A few years ago there was a topical song with a line , " Let 's put out the lights and go to bed . " On the radio the last word was changed to " sleep . " This was a circumlocution , surely , and not a euphemism . Yet behind that simple change lay a deep and complicated social attitude toward sex , symbolized in the word bed . There are many who , even in ordinary conversation , do not use the expression , " go to bed . " They " retire " ; they " withdraw . " To them the word bed has become a sexual symbol , to mention which is to call up a train of unmentionable associations . In the same way the word leg , for long , was replaced by limb ; in German , similarly , Rein ( our word bone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more intimate garments of women , that was out of the question . They were inexpressible and unmentionable . So that , surely enough , they became , in speech , the " inexpressibles " or the " unmentionables . " In German the first of these terms was shortened to die Inex . A great variety of circumlocutions ( frequently containing overtones of euphemism ) clusters about those activities that for one reason or other have been hedged about by taboo . What is it that we most fear ? Death and sexual exposure : the end of life and the process by which it comes into being . The digestive process , too , has been invested with taboo , especially its evacuative aspects . In modern times this has become an aesthetic rather than a protective taboo , but it is powerful enough to create many circumlocutions . A long catalogue of circumlocutions has been built up , then , around the functions of the genito-urinary and the gastro-intestinal tracts . To be sure , we have many seemingly direct phrases and terms for the functions of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , derived from the Greek and the Latin and  | often as little understandable to the man in the street . The common words for common things , in the digestive and the sexual spheres , are most uncommon in our daily speech and , until recently , were most uncommon in print . They have become , indeed , profane and obscene . Profanity and obscenity , however , deserve attention by themselves , and will repay that special consideration . The child is early taught to refer to his needs as " number one " and " number two . " He never defecates or urinates ; he " makes pee-pee , " or , better still , " wee-wee . " He does his " duty . " He makes " attention . " Later he will " move his bowels " or " void his bladder . " He goes to a " lavatory " ( literally , a washroom ) or to the bath-room . Once he went to the water-closet ; that humble place quickly became the W.C. , a term though used abroad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current among grown-ups are equally evasive , and often touched with humor . We are invited to wash our hands , or , if we wear dresses , to powder our noses . We ask for the " johnny , " or , if we are less delicate , for the " can . " It would be beside the point to list , in anything like their entirety , the circumlocutions that have accumulated around the boudoir and the death-bed . Frequently the humor is unintentional , as when pregnancy is described as " an interesting condition . " " Delicate condition , " at least , was a more honest description . " Expectant , " " in the family way , " " well along , " " wearing her apron high , " even suggest the social strata among which the various periphrases originated . " Wearing her apron high " is from a Negro folksong ; " in the high months " is a Yiddish description . The circumlocutions for sexual relations are likewise many . The phrase " sexual intercourse " is the best known @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you come to think of it , is the legal term " criminal ' conversation . " Yet conversation , at first , meant ( Latin conversatio ) " frequent abode in a place . " Talk is but one of its extended meanings . And " criminal conversation " is to be found in Shakespeare .  | Speaking of sexual circumlocutions , I can not forbear to quote from Dean Trench an example not without its special significance . In his Select Glossary he discusses the word gelding , which formerly had the meaning ' eunuch . ' It is " restrained at present , " he writes , " to horses which have ceased to be entire . " ( ! ) It is interesting to observe that in all these cases of circumlocution , the circumlocution represents something that in life , for one reason or another , is concealed . The circumlocution is thus a linguistic form of concealment ; to the concealment or withdrawal of real life it adds the concealment of words . It is quite the same with the many periphrases , in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evasive word , as it were , draws a veil over the reality , just as the shroud covers the corpse or , better still , as the flowers cover the body . The circumlocution establishes a psychological distance between us and the reality . Even the humorous circumlocutions , such as " kick the bucket , " establish this psychological distance ; for laughter is one of the ways in which we deny , or seek to transform , reality . In speaking of death the circumlocution and the euphemism frequently join voices . A cemetery ( Greek , coementerion ) is a sleeping place . ' When we say that the departed has " gone to his reward " ; when we speak of a soul " going to glory " ; when the Indian chants of the " happy hunting-ground " ; when the Jew describes the cemetery as the " good place , " and the after-life as the " true world " ; when the present life is described as a " vale of tears " and the life-to-come as a " paradise " ? what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bend every effort to avoid and to postpone as long as we can ? In a sense , is not every paradise a fool 's paradise ? It is erroneous to believe only that words were once magical . They remain magical , for good as well as for ill . They draw curtains , it is true , against reality ; but also they rend veils , which is to say that they reveal . By building up fantasies , they  | often point the way to achievement . Too frequently they raise a mirage ; but it is through words , after all , that we help to cure the ills of words . Much has been said , and more will and should be said , about the manner in which words , which should be our slaves , have become our masters . The word , we have been cautioned , is not the thing ; to mistake one for the other is to fall into the fallacy of magic . This is just true enough to be important ; it is equally important , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words or about magic . Contemporary writers upon magic and words betray a tendency to emphasize the verbal element at the cost of the psychological . Words , after all , are the tokens of a mentality at work . If , as can so easily be proved , they enslave us , it is because , ultimately , we enslave ourselves . This is true of euphemism and circumlocution . It is just as true of obscenity , profanity , blasphemy , and related verbal interdictions . Wherever we discover a " thou-shalt-not , " we discover a fear ; wherever we discover a circumlocution or a euphemism or a cacophemism , we discover a fear or an evasion . Not all fears are the result of superstition ; certain fears are important to the survival of the human race . We must confront them , nevertheless , and determine whether they belong among the superstitions ? the relics of primitive thinking and expression ? or among the protections . The fable of the Gorgon taught man that if he gazed upon the Gorgon he would turn to stone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to face the Gorgon , it was the Gorgon , not he , who died . Obscenity , profanity , and blasphemy are concepts that have a direct bearing upon linguistic use . Obscenity refers to the sexual and the digestive vocabulary ; profanity and blasphemy refer to the religious vocabulary . All have been vitally affected by the beliefs of the societies in which the concepts  | arose ; the basic attitudes of those societies are frequently to be discovered in the etymologies of the words . The savage , fearing to pronounce a forbidden word , seeks a word that may suggest it ; so , too , the so-called civilized person invents all manner of roundabout phrases for tabooed expressions . He will not say " By God ! " but he will say " By golly ! " He will not say " Hell ! " but he will say " Heck ! " He will not say " For Christ 's sake ! " ? a phrase that contains a deep reservoir of emotional power ? but he will say , " For cryin ' out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with laughter at this particular circumlocution . " For cryin ' out loud ! " represents , like most such circumlocutions , a triumph over taboo . The laughter that greets it is a laughter of contravention ? of fooling the police , so to speak , and " getting away with " something ? " putting one over on the cops , " on the censors , on the lawenforcing element of the community . This is not yet obscenity , which , when successful , is also a defeat of the censors . It is. however , on the borderline . The careless pronunciation of the first four letters in " For cryin ' out loud " ? and , as I have heard it , such a pronunciation is the rule ? sounds suspiciously like the most forbidden word in the language followed by ? or , rather , merged with ? a word that threatens to sound like " Christ . " The phrase is essentially meaningless ; the words " out loud " are employed merely to give the color of meaning to the word " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phrase be forbidden . I do not like the habit of mind that forbids . I do , however , indicate that the phrase is in the cheapest taste imaginable , and that one important reason for the cheapness is that it starts out like a good , hearty oath and ends up as a meaningless expression . It is far worse , in my ears , than saying " For Christ 's sake ! " in loud , unmistakable terms . It has occurred to very few that there is a " class angle " to obscenity . Yet the existence of this " angle " is obvious ; it has become embedded in the history of our words . That long list of four-letter vocables that nobody uses in public , that one 's children are supposed never to learn , and  | that everybody uses in private ? is a list that is derived from Anglo-Saxon . The longer words for the same things , the words that may be used in public , are derived from the Latin and the Greek . Anglo-Saxon was the language of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture , of the upper classes . French , of course , for a long time was the court language of England . The result is that the truly English words for the bodily functions , whether of digestion or of sex , are banished in England , and , naturally , in America , which speaks a dialect of English . On the other hand , there is nothing so disagreeable in the matters of sex or digestion that can not be said in English ? provided you make generous use of Greek and Latin derivatives . It is not only the " class angle , " however , that is to be detected in this state of affairs . A foreign tongue establishes a certain psychological distance between the speaker and the one spoken to ; it adds to the formality of the occasion . It is as a veil thrown over the object that otherwise would suffer exposure . Yet even in this case the class angle is to be detected . You and I , humble persons that we are , walk along the street ; we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promenade along the avenue . One of the numerous words beginning with 1 and defining what the law proclaims to be a reprehensible interest in sex is lewd . Its companions are lubricous , lascivious , lecherous , libidinous , lustful . . . . Roll them off on your tongue and you can easily imagine that you 're sucking a lollipop . Lecherous , in fact , is akin to our word lick , and has reference to a gourmand , or , by extension , one who is always interested in satisfying the carnal appetite . However , it is the little word lewd that is the subject of my immediate interest . For , within its etymology , it contains the essence of a prejudice against the common people . Lewd , described originally the laity , the layman , the nonclerical member of society . From this as the central meaning it came to mean ignorant , vile , vulgar , rude , clumsy , wicked , lawless , evil , wretched , useless and ? the layman being what lie  | is ? libidinous and lustful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since in the olden days education and the clergy were virtually ( and , as we see from the history of lewd , virtuously ) synonymous . The word lewd , then , contains a theological bias . It divides us into churchmen and commoners , with the evil lust on the side of the commoner . The word obscene is added testimony to that bias . Obscene , as nearly as scholars can make out , is derived from two Latin words that mean beholding filth . ' The idea of filth is central , just as it is in the adjective smutty . ( German , Schmutz . ) To associate with filth the process by which we are born , or the pleasurable by-products of that process , is a questionable triumph . We are civilized , to be sure , but we are still victimized by the magical element of words ? the feeling that to name a thing is to materialize it . Consider the history of the word syphilis in this country during the past quarter of a century . The word profanity is another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ temple ' ; profane means outside ' or before the temple , ' and hence , not sacred , ' irreverent . ' Blasphemy is from Greek blasphemein , ' to speak ill , " to slander . ' It is one of the nearer ancestors of our word blame . It is a far cry from blaspheming to blaming . Blasphemy itself is more effectively dealt with in connection with the taboo against names , and with the euphemisms invented to avoid pronouncing a holy name outside of its proper context . When Othello was first played in the United States it was not presented as a play ; such a term , like the word theater itself , dwelt in the shadow of iniquity . Othello was described for its patrons as a moral lecture . So , too , for years , playhouses were described as anything but houses where plays were given . As late as the period of Gilbert and Sullivan the theater was regarded as an annex to the brothel ; Thomas German Reed 's  | theater , where Gilbert first learned the suavities that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the Gallery of Illustration . The audience came , supposedly , not to witness a play with music ; that would have been wicked . They came to see characters " illustrated " by the actors . The scenes were pictures , therefore the auditorium was a gallery . This euphemism lasted well into the twentieth century ; and in the United States the famous old Boston Museum maintained the fiction of an art-gallery to the end ; it had canvases on display . Nevertheless , everybody knew that it was a theater , and that here the play was the thing . Often , then , the rejection of a euphemism indicates the emergence of a new social consciousness , just as the original euphemism indicated the evasion of an unpleasant , but not necessarily an unconquerable , reality . The word syphilis is a striking case in point . Originally it was the name of a shepherd in a Latin poem by Fracastoro ( 1530 ) , and was spelt Syphilus . It is conjectured that the name is derived from Greek sys , ' a hog , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It indicates a serious venereal disease . Perhaps , for the sake of preciseness , I should have said " sexual " disease . For venereal , that is , relating to Venus , is itself euphemistic . As the name of a sexual scourge , syphilis was doubly a candidate for euphemistic treatment . ( The more specifically medical term is lues , which may refer to any pestilential disease . It is associated with the lu element in our word pollute . ) The euphemism for syphilis became , by an effort of gentility , " the social disease . " This has lasted into our own day . A campaign of social education , however , has led to curious results ? to the downfall , in fact , of a euphemism together with the downfall of the taboo that was interfering with the eradication of a scourge . How difficult it is for even the more enlightened members of the community to rid themselves of ancient taboos is well illustrated in a book devoted to A Plea for Monogamy , by Dr. Wilfred Lay . Dr. Lay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before children . " Many chil- dren , " he writes , " never see their parents in puris naturalibus , though there is no logical or psychological reason why they should not , and many psychological reasons why they should have experiences that would prevent them , boys as well as girls , from the shock of some later revelation . " Consider the amusing psychology ? and language ? of that quotation . How are the parents going to put such discretion into practice if the very man who counsels it takes refuge , at the crucial moment of his thesis , in the draperies of Latin ? How are the parents to learn courage from a counselor who , in the very act of advocating bodily nakedness , shows that he fears verbal nakedness ? Are we after the naked truth , or after Truth in puris naturalibus ? The power of taboo is even more strangely and fearfully shown in the autobiography of Frank Harris , wherein he sets down almost every forbidden word in the language . But what are the words that he can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of uncensored living and writing ? Damn and hell ! These he writes , consistently , d ? n and h ? 1 , like any Gilbertian captain on the deck of the good ship H.M.S. Pinafore singing that he has never spoken a " big , big D  --  ! " In one of the most progressive of our states , the terminology of mental affliction has changed in accordance not only with euphemism but with a more enlightened attitude toward insanity . Insanity itself means unsoundness ; it has become specialized to indicate only a certain kind of unsoundness . There is no inherent reason why it should indicate only unsoundness of mind , or why sanity should indicate soundness of mind . Latin sanus refers to health ; a sanitarium is a retreat or a station dedicated to health ; sanitation is the science of hygiene . Originally the committee that watched over the mental health of the state was known as the Board of Lunacy . Lunacy is a word that contains evidence of an outmoded theory of mental illness . Luna is Latin for moon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moonstruck . " To-day , the word lunatic has lost caste ; it is not a part of the scientific or the medical  | vocabulary . In the same way , such a term as Lunatic Asylum seems somehow rustic to a sensitive contemporary . Asylum itself , in this connection , was a euphemism ; it is derived from the Greek asulon , which meant originally inviolable , ' that is , exempt from spoliation or seizure . An aslyum , then , was a sanctuary , to which criminals and debtors might repair and find protection from their persecutors . The present meaning , though easily understood , is the last of its numerous differentiations . From the board that governed a Lunatic Asylum to such a designation as the State Board of Insanity is a step that is more important than it sounds . The conception of insanity , as opposed to lunacy , reveals a widening and deepening of understanding , and , what is quite as significant , human sympathy . It was a mark of progress when we ceased referring to the mentally ill as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another mark of progress when the State Board of Insanity had its name changed to Commission of Mental Diseases . For , since words are not stable in their meanings and connotations , insane soon began to acquire certain overtones that had sounded from lunacy . Mental disease , moreover , has a more scientific ring than has insanity . It carries far less of the unpleasant connotation that adheres to insanity . Observe the name now suggested for the same group : Commission of Mental Health . This is , in certain respects , a euphemism , but it helps to emphasize a valuable consideration : that not all euphemism is a cowardly turning-away from I reality , nor a weak attempt to deceive oneself with wordjugglery . There is nothing to be gained , for example , by naming an institution a Home for Incurables . The psychological effect upon the inmates or the visitors is bad , and it is conceivable that the life of an incurable may be shortened by telling him brutally the truth about his condition . Ibsen , iii his self-satire The Wild Duck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indiscriminate truth-telling . Popular wisdom discriminates between white lies and black , even as the Church distinguishes between white magic and black . Naming a board  | a Commission of Mental Health places the emphasis upon the determination to cure , rather than upon the supine acceptance of the ailment . This is the more significant since insane persons are not the inevitably incurable demons that an uninstructed public once thought them to be . Euphemism , then , is not altogether a sign of failure to make a salutary adjustment to reality , any more than " escape " literature is unmistakably a token of inability to cope with reality . Certainly , in the beginning , euphemism represents a verbal escape , and pays tribute to a primitive belief in the power of words over fact . If , however , it appears that certain words may ? for a time , at least ? designate certain things without arousing an unpleasant train of associations that would be stirred up by another word or expression for the same things , we follow a natural , self-protective instinct in making @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense , it appears that words do possess " magic " after all . They may , when skilfully employed , silence certain associations and summon others . Such a skill is used for evil and for good , as are all things that come to the mind and hand of man . Colored is a euphemism for Negro ; Hebrew is a euphemism for Jew ; Scientist is a euphemism , or a circumlocution with euphemistic overtones , for Christian Scientist . The words for racial coloration are , like all else in language , approximative only . The yellow race is not , strictly speaking , yellow ; nor is the Indian red ; nor is the Caucasian white ; nor is the Negro black , which is what Negro means . The unscientific racial spectrum , however , has little to do with the euphemism inherent in colored as applied to the Negro . The use of colored is ( both as euphemism and as circumlocution ) based upon the desire to avoid the term Negro . The Negro himself often employs euphemisms for the term , just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words Negro and Jew have become , through historical circumstance ,  | freighted with overtones of prejudice and misunderstanding . There are Jews who have become so sensitive that the very sound of the word Jew , as made by a Gentile , rings unjustly in their ears with an unpleasant tone . There are other Jews who ? again resembling , psychologically , the troubled Negro ? try to " pass , " which is the Negro term for being taken as a white . To such Jews , intent upon being accepted virtually as Gentiles , any word indicative of Semitic origin is unwelcome . Between the avowed Jew and the Jew who would conceal his origin is a stratum of Jews who would not think of denying their origin , but who , nevertheless , dislike the word Jew because of its unpleasant associations . To such Jews the adjective and noun Hebrew seem to possess greater dignity than Jew . With the psychological and economic implications of these euphemisms I am concerned only in so far as they explain the linguistic usage . There is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is useful , and at times necessary , to draw between them a sharp distinction . Yiddish refers to the language developed from Middle High German , and to the people who speak it . Hebrew refers to the Semitic tongue of Biblical days , of which a contemporary form is spoken in Palestine to-day . Jewish includes any activity of the Jews . A Jew may speak , as his daily tongue , Yiddish ; he may recite his prayers in Hebrew ; he may have interests that overflow the banks of either speech . Many of his Jewish interests may be carried on in English , or whatever is the tongue of the country in which he dwells . There are Jews who are Hebrews ; there are also Jews who are Hebrews only by courtesy of language . The description Hebrew , then , appears often as a designation intended to soften the impact of the word Jew . I recall a long conversation on music with one of the greatest singers the Negroes have produced ? a gentleman of unassertive nobility to whom his music @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his people . Not once did he use the word Jew or the word Negro ; it was always " your group " and  | " my group . " This , too , was euphemism with overtones of circumlocution . Nigger , of course , is a variant of Negro , just as Yid is slang for Jew , founded probably upon the adjective or the noun Yiddish . Yid has a derogatory implication , more objectionable than Jew . Many Jews who would not object at all to being called Jew would bridle , and perhaps justly , at Yid . To those of Russian origin , especially , with the sound Zhid ringing in their ears and the memory of pogroms in their hearts , it would possess a sinister suggestion . As for the word Scientist used for Christian Scientist , there is a valid objection to it because of the easy confusion with the same word used in an entirely different sense . In writing or printing , where it is a simple matter to capitalize the S , the objection is less valid on these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ context shows generally what is meant . Yet there are other objections , from the purely semantic point of view . There is , for example , a Jewish Science as well as a Christian ; should adherents to this faith take to using Scientist as an abbreviated form for Jewish Scientist , confusion would be worse confounded . The word scientist , as used by itself , has come to have a definite connotation ; that connotation is not a religious connotation . This is not to say that scientists are irreligious ; certain eminent scientists , indeed , arise at once to refute such an interpretation . At the root of the word scientist however , is a reference to a way of looking at the data of existence ; that way is not the way or the mood of religion , and to use the word scientist to refer not to the procedure of the laboratory but rather to the religious attitude is to invert long-established linguistic usage . It is virtually , though not necessarily in conscious manner , to claim for a faith the support of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not good language . It is not either of these things because the term scientist does not , as used in the new manner , point to a clear meaning , whereas in its established sense it is itself scientifically clear .  | One 's name seems peculiarly a part of oneself . It is not strange that names , in the evolution of human thought and action , should have become specially subject to linguistic superstition .  | I N THE SPEECH OF THESEUS THAT OPENS THE FIFTH ACT OF A Midsummer-Night 's Dream , there is a famous passage that has , whether or not Shakespeare intended it to have , a pertinency to the beginnings of language and even of mythology . The poet 's eye , in a fine frenzy rolling , Doth glance from heaven to earth , from earth to heaven ; And as imagination bodies forth The forms of things unknown , the poet 's pen Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing A local habitation and a name . Such tricks hath strong imagination , That , if it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that joy .. The natural ease with which we personify ? that is , express ourselves by impressing ourselves upon our speech-materialappears very strikingly in our constant use of the word Nature . In language , as in other respects , man is at once , in the Spinozan phrases , natura naturans and natura naturata ? nature as the creator , ' and nature as that which is created ' ? the active and the passive principles of life . Etymologically , Nature means birth ; it is thus related to such words as native , nation .  | We are forever ascribing life , and therefore meaning and purpose , to Nature . The bridge between consciously figurative speech and speech in which personifications are resurrected into life is , in colloquial talk , easily spanned . This is true not only of the unscientific layman , but of scientists preeminent in their special fields . See by what subtle gradations a Sir James Jeans may evolve , from a universe seemingly guided by a mathematical principle , a Creator who is a Cosmic Mathematician . Nor was he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the student of evolution , taking the suggestion from Darwin himself , falls into the habit of speaking about natural selection as if Nature watched over her mutations , selecting this one and rejecting that . The Lamarckian modification of Darwinism , indeed , transforms such selection into a conscious , willed alteration on the part of the individual . This , as the reasoning seems to run , is how the phenomenon works out ; therefore somebody ( Nature ) has worked it out . The perfect reductio ad absurdum of this Nature fallacy is reached by the French historian Michelet . Freud quotes him , in Wit and the Unconscious , ) as remarking , in The Woman , " How beautifully everything is arranged by nature . As soon as the child comes into the world it finds a mother who is ready to care for it . " ( ! ) This is as funny as the mot quoted by Guerard about the French entomologist Henri Fabre . The praying mantis devours her mate in the very act of union . " This , " exclaims the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " 2 The fallacy is not merely a linguistic one ; it is , of course , a psychological complication . Substitute , in this connection , the word god or gods for the word Nature , and you get a hint ? a hint only ? of the role that words have played in the origins of mythology and religion . For myth is often ex-post-facto etymology ; so , too , are heroes often eponymous ? that is , invented to explain the word or the name that suggests them .  | We ask , almost instinctively , for names and as instinctively bestow them . One of the first things we are taught is our own name ; long before it becomes a matter of pride or honor , it is a utilitarian label . Names , which to-day are chiefly labels , once had a significance of which both bearer and bestower were deeply conscious . According to the Bible , hardly had the Lord God completed the creation of the universe when He paraded before Adam the hosts of the brute world . These He brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : and whatsoever Adam called every living creature , that was the name thereof . And Adam gave names to all cattle , and to the fowl of the air and to every beast of the field . " It was the first inventory . Later , Adam , awaking from the sleep during which woman had been fashioned from his rib , felt immediately the need of naming her , and did so in full consciousness of his philological role . " This is now bone of my bones , and flesh of my flesh : She shall be called Woman , because she was taken out of Man . " We are not occupied with the correctness of Adam 's linguistics . Philology as a science is relatively new , dating from the first quarter of the last century . Moreover , the English Bible is a translation from the Hebrew , and from a Greek version of the original text . Adam , of course , could not have used English ; nor does woman , whether in English or in Hebrew , mean " taken out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as that author discovered who , having written a book on Jesus that achieved a nationwide circulation , praised in it the choice of short words by the Christ . Jesus , in his parables , spoke a dialect that was rather poor in short words ; those words belonged to the translators of the New Testament into English . What we are interested in now is the need ? and it is felt throughout the Book of Genesis ? for naming man and beast , and often for explaining the choice of the name . Adam itself is Hebrew for ' red , ' and is akin to the Hebrew for ' blood . ' Strangely , we receive no commentary in Genesis upon the name of the first man . When Adam raises his mate  | from the status of anonymous womanhood and names her Eve , it is " because she was the mother of all living .

' In the Italian phrase , alla vostra , the essential word for health is left out ; the complete expression should be alla vostra salute , ' to your health . ' When God changes the name of Abram to Abraham , He explains : " for a father of many nations have I made thee . " Abram means exalted father ' ; Abraham , father of a multitude . ' " As for Sarai thy wife , " adds the Lord , " thou shalt not call her Sarai , but Sarah shall her name be . " The change is not explained in the text ; Sarai means contentious , ' quarrelsome , ' whereas Sarah signifies a princess . ' Sarai , then , was raised in honor even as was Abram . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; now , rendered fertile , she stands beside the father of multitudes . So , too , when the Lord " saw that Leah was hated , he opened her womb . . . . And Leah conceived . " Four sons she bore , and named the first Reuben . " For she said , Surely the Lord hath looked down upon my affliction ; now therefore my husband will love me . ' " Reuben means Behold , a son ! ' Her other sons she named Simeon ( famous ) , Levi ( adhesion ) and Judah ( praise ) . Names may embody destiny . Recall the dramatic moment in the New Testament ( Matthew , xvl , 17 , 18 ) when Jesus addresses Simon : " Blessed art thou , Simon Barjona : for flesh and blood bath not revealed it unto thee , but my Father which is in heaven . " And I say also unto thee , That thou art Peter , and upon this rock I will build my church ; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for Peter is derived  | from the Greek for stone or rock . Simon is a shortened form of Simeon . There was little need for the Hebrews or the Greeks , in their literature , to offer translations of names unless the names bore a special significance . To us , who have all but lost the feeling for the inner meaning of names , and who rarely pause to ask what our own names may mean , such translation sometimes becomes necessary . The Greeks , for example , were , like other more primitive peoples , highly conscious of the meanings of their names . When they bestowed such descriptions as Kleomenes and Thucydides and Megacles , it was because there was a superstitious support in calling a man glorious spirit , ' to the divine glory , ' to great glory , ' which is what , respectively , these three names mean ? and invoke . So Nikephoros means bearer of victory , ' Demosthenes , power of the people , ' Polycrates , to great power , ' and Alexander , protector of men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter for later consideration ; what is important now is that names are words no different from any others . When John Bunyan wrote his vision of The Pilgrim 's Progress , he might easily have named his characters after Hebrew or Greek prototypes . So , for that matter , might the Puritans have used Hebrew names in their Biblical forms , instead of translating them into English , often with an effect that posterity finds unintentionally humorous . Fighting sin and glorifying the Lord are noble occupations , but who , to-day , could persevere with a name such as Kill-Sin Pimple , or Praise-God Barebones ? Bunyan , out of a psychological directness and simplicity that irradiate his prose , named his characters with all the plainness of a morality play . The names and their meanings are one and unmistakable : Christian , Faithful , Evangelist , Obstinate , Pliable , Worldly Wiseman , Facing-Both-Ways , Fair-Speech , TwoTongues . One of the few foreign names in the dream is Apollyon , the monster who bestrides the road before the advancing pilgrim . Apollyon is Greek for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which is also the name of the city that Christian has abandoned for the good life . The name of Bunyan 's places are as direct as are those of his people . They have enriched our language with many a phrase that we take for granted , without being aware of the visionary tinker who gave to these dream-places a local habitation and a name : the House Beautiful , Vanity Fair , the Slough of Despond . To-day such a method of naming people or places would seem obvious ? too much like appending a diagram to a joke . It belongs , least offensively , to travesty ; we think of such characters as Gilbert 's Dick Deadeye , or Shaw 's General Spitsneezeandkoff , or that masterly creation of George S. Kaufman and Morrie Ryskind , Vice-President Alexander Throttlebottorn , from Of Thee I Sing . A rose by any other name would smell as sweet , but might not sound so sweet ; and sound , with names , is sometimes more important than sense . The sound , indeed , through its associations , may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is appears from the to-do about naming children yet unborn . It is as if the name itself may possess some magic power that will follow the child through life . The association between names and magic is ancient . The last three lines of the quotation from the speech of Theseus have been overlooked in favor of what precedes them . To me they have always been as important as the more familiar portion . Imagination not only comprehends " some bringer of that joy . " It names the bringer ; it personalizes the messenger . It is not only the bringer of joy that is personified . We tend , even as civilized beings , to personify ? to create in our own image ? much of our experience . Even a philosopher who has nearly tripped upon a banana peel may turn upon the inanimate object and kick it off the sidewalk with all the anger of a child punishing a kitten that scratches . Of this mental habit were born Mythology and its pale descendant Allegory . Words can actually give shape and sound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? and dangerous ? powers .  | To return to our children ; we name them as much for sound as for sense ; sound , too , has a sense all its own . Names ? whether of people , or of places , or of the days of the week , or of the months of the year ? have by unending repetition lost their original meaning and have become labels . The names by which we know the days of the week , or the months of the year , involve us at once in a number of mythologies that we have but imperfectly abandoned . Sunday relates to the worship of the sun , as Monday relates to the worship of the moon . Tuesday is Tiw 's day , the day named after the Teutonic god of war , as Wednesday is the day of Woden , who corresponds in the Teutonic mythology to Mercury in the Latin . Thursday is the day of Thor , god of thunder ; Friday is the day of Frig , wife of Woden . Saturday is Saturn 's day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naming the days of the week . In Russian , for example , the name for Sunday ( vosskressenye ) is associated with the idea of resurrection . Monday ( ponedyelnik ) means simply the beginning of the week . ' Wednesday ( sreda ) means middle , ' just as the German Mittwoch ( Wednesday ) means mid-week . ' Tuesday , Thursday and Friday are , in Russian , words signifying second , ' fourth ' and fifth day , ' respectively . Saturday is subbota , or Sabbath . ' In Spanish and French , Sunday is dedicated , not to the sun , not to the resurrection , but to the Lord ( Latin , Dominici dies the Lord 's day ' ; domingo and dimanche , respectively ) . Monday is , to be sure , the day of the moon : banes and lundi , respectively , for Spanish and French . Tuesday , too , is devoted to a god of war , but this time the Roman god Mars : martes , mardi . Wednesday is still Mercury 's day : miercoles , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jeudi ? the same Jove who is akin to Tiw , who named our Tuesday . Friday , as in our own tongue , is named after a goddess , but this goddess is Venus : viernes , vendredi . Saturday , as in Russian , is the Sabbath : sdbado , samedi .  | That we should name days after saints and gods and goddesses tells us something , at once , about our beliefs ; that , in English those gods and goddesses should represent both the Teutonic and the Greco-Roman deities tells us , again , something about the strains that have contributed to our civilization , just as the word Sabbath , which may mean either Saturday or Sunday , indicates yet another source , the Hebrew . Indeed , the fact that Sabbath may refer to either Saturday or Sunday indicates an important rift in our civilization . For that matter , to a Mohammedan ? and here another rift is indicated ? Sabbath stands for Friday . The names of the months are imbedded with similar data . What should January have to do with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gate ; Janus was the god of gates and doors , and hence of all beginnings . January , as the month of Janus , might be looked upon as the door to the year . It was not always the first month , however . A door has two sides ; hence Janus is represented with two faces . He was the god of the sun and the year , for between year and sun there is a direct mathematical relation ; the chief definition of year is the time required by the earth to make its revolution around the sun . Mr. Facing-Both-Ways , whom we met in The Pilgrim 's Progress , might thus be a brother to Janus , who , in addition to all his other attributes , quite naturally may become a symbol of hypocrisy . Was it altogether an accident that Shakespeare , in the first act of Othello , made Iago swear by Janus ? What could be more appropriate than for such an arch-hypocrite as Iago to invoke a two-faced god ? Yet it should be remembered that the two faces @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italians , hypocrisy . And has not Emerson written , " A friend is Janus-faced ; he looks to the past and the future " ? Two-faced , in popular usage , easily becomes double-faced . Double-faced easily becomes hypocritical , especially when we remember that hypocrite comes from the Greek for an actor , i. e. , one who plays a role . We began with the first month of the year ; it has taken us through doors , mythologies , double-dealing ? double-dealing  | on the part of words themselves , in fact , which can face two ways , and more than two ! February is associated with expiation , purification , and , more prosaically , cleansing . The februa was a feast of expiation . Mars is the only deity who rejoices in a month of the year as well as a day of the week . March is his month , as Tuesday , in its French , Spanish , and Italian forms ( mardi , martes , martedi ) is his day . April is associated with newness ; it is the month @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ open , ' and Aprilis , the name of the month in Latin , suggests the opening of spring . An " April gentleman " is a newly wed , though he is not necessarily an April fool . May is derived from Maius , and may be akin to Maia , a goddess , daughter of Atlas and mother of Mercury . June pays homage to Junius , the name of a Roman tribe . July pays homage to Caius Julius Cesar . The earlier name of this month was Quintilus , which meant simply the fifth month , ' just as piatnitza , in Russia , means the fifth day , ' which we call Friday . Originally , the Roman year began in March , so that July would be fifth in order . So , too , the earlier name of August was Sextilis , or sixth month . ' The name that we inherit comes from that of Augustus Caesar . The rest of the months lack interest from the verbal standpoint , consisting simply of numeration : September , October , November and December are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and tenth months , reckoned from March as the first month . When the French revolutionists reformed , together with their society , their calendar , they renamed the months according to a most logical system . The republic having begun on September 22 , 1792 , the New Year began on the same date , by decree of the National Convention , in 1793 . It was in effect only twelve years , being abolished in 1805 . The renaming of the months , however , reminds us not only that the calendar  | has been changed more than once , but that there is nothing inherently eternal in even the most sacred words . It gives us a feeling , too , of language being created ? if but abortively in this case ? almost under our eyes , just as , in our own day , it is being created in our very ears . Consider the months of the French revolutionary calendar : There is an appealing nationality to these names that is joined to an equally appealing poetry . Naming the months after their characteristic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the soil during the weather of the respective months , was a tribute at once to the beneficence of nature and to the common toiler in whose interests the Revolution had ostensibly been planned . As a system of names the French revolutionary calendar is superior to the ones that the Western world ? including France ? uses to-day . It is consistent , even beautiful . Beauty and consistency , however , avail little against the inertia of long usage and convenience . ? 3 . PERSONS AND NAMES INTO WORDS Names , originally , were words denoting things , acts , or qualities ; it is not strange , then , that they tend so often to revert to their first condition . Epicurus was a Greek philosopher ; he taught , it is true , that pleasure is the only good , but his conception of the highest happiness was to diminish the number of man 's desires . His name thus became suggestive  | of refined voluptuousness in the matter of food and drink . A person of such fastidiousness , from being called an Epicurus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an Apikeiros ( derived from the same source that gives us epicure ) is a free-thinker . For Epicurus was not only a hedonist ( Greek hedonia , happiness ' ) but a believer in the atomistic theory of Democritus , the " laughing philosopher " who provided the basis of the evolutionary theories of Lucretius . Epicurus was thus the type of disbeliever . The Gentiles made of his name a symbol of the body ; the Jews made of his name a symbol of the spirit , even if but a negative symbol . If elderly rakes are called Lotharios , it is because of a character in Rowe 's drama The Fair Penitent , in which one so named seduces Calista . If the word rarely occurs without the adjective " gay " preceding it , it is because of the line from that play : Is this that haughty , gallant , gay Lothario ? In the same way , another type of rake is called a Don Juan . A disciplinarian is called a martinet because of a drill-system that was devised by a M. Martinet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roland for an Oliver " ? that is , of returning for a blow received a blow of equal strength ? because Roland and Oliver , in the tales that grew up around the story of Charlemagne , were two knights who were evenly matched in heroic combat . A Roland for an Oliver means tit for tat ' ; and tit for tat is merely another way of saying this for that . ' Guides are notoriously talkative ; because Cicero was a great orator , the Italians , at first humorously no doubt , named their guides ciceroni , or Ciceros . Hence the word cicerone , or Cicero , for guide . Epicurus a sign over a restaurant , and Cicero a loquacious barker ! The etymological lot of the great Caesar was happier . For Caesar gave to more than one country in Europe its name for the ruling sovereign : in Russia , Czar ; in Germany , Kaiser . So Charlemagne ( the great Charles ; in Latin , Charles is Carolus ) gave to Russia and other nations their word for king : Karol @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken from the womb by cutting through the walls of the abdomen and the uterus , such an operation to-day is called a Cxsarian section . ( Latin , secare , to cut ' ; sectio , ' cutting . ' The German for section ' is A bschnitt , from abschneiden , to cut off . ' ) The possibilities for the formation of such words are as many , indeed , as the names of persons who acquire fame or notoriety for one reason or another . Such terms as volt and ampere and watt in the vocabulary of electricity pay tribute to men whose gifts advanced the control of this mysterious power . Botany is densely populated with genera that once were men : forsythia , named after William Forsyth , who brought the shrub from China ; fuchsia , named after the German , Leonhard Fuchs ; freesia , commemorating the Swedish botanist , Elias Magnus Fries . Of words that are derived from names alone a large dictionary could be compiled . What is more important than the particular name that provides the etymon for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whatever conies to hand , or eye , or to ear . Once the word has been made , and has passed because of irreplaceable usefulness into the vocabulary , its origin is all but forgotten and its best warrant becomes its utility . Nor is this to be looked upon as a process that belongs to the linguistic past . Words are coined almost daily from the names of persons . A hundred years ago we named a waterproof garment a mackintosh , after its inventor , Charles Mackintosh : after Lord Raglan we named a different type of overcoat . In our own time we have named a style of woman 's hairdress after the coiffeur who introduced it : the Marcel wave . Marcel has become not only an adjective , but a noun ( a marcel ) , and a verb ( to marcel ) . Names have become even interjections : Great Scott ! Holy Moses ! Jumping Jehosophat ! The Dickens ! The word dickens , by the way , although it probably comes from a name , is not the name of Charles Dickens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Shakespeare ; it is to be found in The Beggar 's Opera . It is used as a euphemism for the devil or the deuce.  | We speak of our fountain pens as Watermans or Parkers ; we call our automobiles our Packards or our Fords . From such a conscious etymological association to one that is completely unaware of the source of a word , it is but a historical step . The story of such a word as victrola represents a transitional stage . Victrola is a word coined by the Victor Phonograph Company to designate their special types of talking-machines . Frigidaire is likewise a proprietary word . So popular did these types become that the public took to calling any type of talkingmachine a victrola , and any type of refrigerator a frigidaire . A word that has had even greater fortune is vaseline , which remains to this day a trademark . The manufacturer of the article gives as its origin the German Wasser , water , ' and the Greek elaion , olive oil . ' The word is as smooth as the product @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and few indeed are aware that it is as patently a manufactured product as is the article that it names . Isms and names exhibit a natural associative affinity . The suffix - ism , as is to be seen in the first word of this paragraph , readily became a noun . It is Greek ; it forms nouns that corresponds to verbs in - ize , another suffix that signifies to cause or to make . To idolize , for example , is to make into an idol ' ; to hypnotize is to cause to sleep . ' ( Greek hypnos , sleep . ' ) The suffix - ism , then , would indicate action , process , state , doctrine , or distinguishing characteristic . Darwinism , Marxism , Catholicism , Protestantism , Judaism ? these offer a few examples of terms that are manufactured almost at will . Everything is grist that comes to the mill of language . About the making of a person 's name into an ordinary word there is nothing strange or irregular . It is part of the process followed in all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word-manufacture . That names of persons should become nouns is far less novel than it appears ; for the word name and the word noun are , historically , the same . The first , more directly , comes to us from the Germanic tongues ( Anglo-Saxon nama , German Name ) ; the second , from the French nom , which in turn is derived from the Latin nomen . A name , then , is simply a  | specialized noun . Sometimes we read , or hear it loosely said , that many words come from names . But all names are words , and they are none the less words for being applied to creatures that can move and talk and give names in turn . One philologist maintains , indeed , that the first words were designations of human beings ? that they were not so much what we call names as what we call pronouns . " In our opinion , " writes Breal , 3 " the first word to stand out from all others was the pronoun . I believe that this category is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it requires less inventiveness , because it is more instinctive , and more easily commentated upon by gesture . We should not , therefore , allow ourselves to be deceived by the term pronoun ' ( pro nomine , instead of a noun ' ) which comes to us from the Latins , who , in turn , themselves translated it from the Greek ( antonumia ) . The error has lasted into our own days . Pronouns are , on the contrary , in my belief the most ancient part of language . How could our me ever have lacked for an expression with which to indicate itself ? " Pronouns , says Breal , are the most mobile elements in language ; they are never definitely attached to a single person , but are forever on the go . " There are as many me 's as there are individuals who speak ; there are as many you 's as persons to whom I may speak . There are as many he 's ( better still , it 's ) as there are real or imaginary objects in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that these pronouns contain no descriptive element . Thus a language composed only of pronouns would resemble the babbling of a child or the gesticulation of a deaf mute . The need of another element , out of which were formed the noun , the adjective , and the verb , was therefore evident . But it is none the less true that the pronoun takes its place as the foundation and the origin of languages : it was without doubt with the pronoun . . . that the differentiation into grammatical categories began . " There is a certain logic to this . Man , as the measure of all things , awaking to the world , might naturally be imagined as  | eventually dividing it into self and not-self . It is a question that must be settled , however , by the psychologists . If linguistic research could prove what Breal maintains , it would add weight to such a psychological view . Were the first words pronouns or adjectives ? That is , were they designations of self or crude descriptions of the outside world , out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speech evolved ? In a negative way , studies in the evolution of grammar may come to our assistance . It seems to be a question , however , whether we became ( or , as infants , become ) conscious first of ourselves or of the rest of our environment ? whether the I or the it arrives earlier in the course of our gradual achievement of the feeling that we are distinct from the rest of creation . As thus stated , it looks like a question for the philosophers as well as for the psychologists . In any case , it stands on the outer frontier of linguistic investigation . It may be indicative that , as pronouns are supposed to be made out of nouns , they may almost as easily be made into nouns . There is nothing strange about saying " my ego " or " your ego . " Ego is Greek and Latin for I. ' To be able to say " my I " is not only a triumph of grammar but of understanding . It could not have been done in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain depth of self-understanding , and a certain ability to consider oneself not only subjectively but objectively . As for the phrase " your ego , " the word ego has undergone a transformation through which , from meaning ' I , ' it has come to mean anyone 's I ' ? that is , anyone 's self . Just as anyone 's name may become an ordinary noun , standing for something inanimate , so may the very word for the speaker , as referring only to himself , become a word for the one spoken to . What else is involved in the process by which the name of a person becomes a word standing for that which makes the person prominent in the eyes of others ? Anciently , men looked up to Croesus ( Greek , Kroisos ) , the king of Lydia in the sixth century , B. C. , as a man of immense wealth . Thereupon Croesus became a term for rich man . ' Instead of saying , " A is  | brummagem and cologne and bedlam we have to be reminded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacture for cheap jewelry ; the second , from the French name for the German city of Koln ; and the third from the Hospital of St. Mary of Bethlehem , in London , which has been used , since 1402 , as a hospital for the mentally ill . In Hebrew , Bethlehem signifies the house of food . ' The fact that one of the meanings of bedlam is a house for the insane has nothing whatsoever to do with the original meaning of the name Bethlehem ; the derived meaning comes from the accidental circumstance that a place in London happened to be named after the town in Judea , and happened also to be devoted to the care of " lunatics . " Many changes in words are quite as circumstantial as this , and quite as devoid of formal logic . Associations of ideas have a logic of their own . Monographs upon word-names and place-names are numerous . The classical work upon the subject is by Isaac Taylor , whose book upon the alphabet is yet another pioneer treatise that , if now out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ list of words from the names of people , or from the products or qualities of places and of the people in those places , is but a sample . In each case the word should be consulted in a large dictionary ( small dictionaries are for children , or for grown-ups in too much of a hurry ) and followed to its ultimate origin .  | At the core of the belief in the magic of words lies the feeling that the universe is permeated by a mysterious , all-creative , all-destructive power . For this power , anthropologists generally have adopted the name Mana , which is what the savages of the Pacific call it . The word appears to mean something like power , influence , authority . The thing itself has been compared to the Greek physis , from phyo , to bring forth . ' ( This is at the base of such words of ours as physics . ) It would thus be more or less equivalent to Latin Natura . As we have seen , there are many , indeed , even to-day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to express the otherwise inexpressible concept of that primal power through which the world came into existence and through which it continues . Natura itself is akin to French naitre , to be born , ' and stands for the bringing forth of life or matter . A nation suggests , etymologically , a people of the same birth ; formerly , when peoples were far more homogeneous than they are to-day , blood-relationship was the foundation of social groups . To bear the same name was a token of this relationship ; only later was it permissible for one born out of the group to assume the name of the group . " Mana , " as Mr. Edward Clodd has explained in the opening chapter of his book Magic in Names , " is the stuff through which magic works ; it is not the trick itself , but the power whereby the sorcerer does his trick . " Mana inheres in everything : in blood , in hair , in teeth , in spittle ; in shadows , in personal names , in words . It animates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Since , to the primitive mind , there is no hard and fast distinction between a thing and the name for the thing , to possess the name is fairly to possess , to control , the thing . When we consider how much we are , in our less civilized moments , ruled by superstitions ? fear of the number thirteen , knocking twice on wood to avert reversal of good fortune , carrying " lucky " coins , cultivating " lucky " numbers , " playing  | hunches " ? it is easier to imagine ourselves back in the times when every word and every act might have a determining influence upon events . We are still , more than we care to confess , in the thrall of superstition and taboo . If , in ancient social groups , one 's name was specially guarded against discovery , it was because to know the name was to be able to use it in evil conjuring . The custom lingers in the fairy-tales that are read by our children . They know the fate of Rumpelstiltskin as well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingers , moreover , in certain habits of civilized society : in the naming and renaming of persons ; in the evasion of certain words that have come to be frowned upon by society because of their power in calling up unpleasant ideas or circumstances ; in the notion , still current , that as an evil name may work evil , a good name may achieve good . Among a number of peoples it has been a custom to change the name of a dying person , in a last attempt to cheat the Angel of Death . It is the name that Death has come to claim , not the person . Or , rather , the name is the person . The custom is still so common that I have known it to be practised in recent years . Clodd , in the final chapter of the book mentioned , speculates upon the etymology of the various words for name ' in Irish ( ainm ) , Old Welsh ( anu , enu ) , Old Bulgarian ( ime ) , and many other tongues , and quotes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If one 's name were considered one 's very soul , it is easy to understand the taboos that hedge it about . Is it any wonder , then , that to accompany such superstitions as astrology , there flourish in our midst such atavisms as onomancy and numerology ? Onomancy ( Greek onoma , name , and mdntia , divination ' ) means divination from one 's name . Numerology is a more complicated form of the same superstition . To each letter of one 's name is assigned a numerical value , and the computation from the letters made forms the basis for the divination or prophecy concerning the bearer of the name . Onomancy goes back to the magic of names ; nu- merology goes back to the magic of numbers as applied , with much hocus-pocus , to the letters of one 's name and the astral influences that they contain . It is thus to be seen that any reform in the spelling of one 's name may be fraught with deep consequences , and that therefore an important difference exists between Rosalind and Rosalynd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that is , if you believe in numerology , astrology and onomancy . If , in Santa Cruz , a son-in-law may not pronounce the name of his mother-in-law , it is because of the more deeply rooted taboo that he must not look upon her face for the rest of his life . If , among the Omahas of North America , the parents-inlaw may not mention the name of their son-in-law , it is because of the more deeply rooted taboo that they must not address him . So completely may the name stand for the person that the assumption of the name of one 's parent may symbolize an earlier stage of actual cannibalism . S. Baring-Gould , in Family Names and Their Story , has traced the process by which hereditary nomenclature came about . At first , he says , the members of a tribe , in order to be distinguished as forming parts of the group , underwent bodily mutilation . The custom survives in the tonsuring of priests , for example . Mutilation gave way to distinctive costumes . It was a simpler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to part one 's hair in a certain way , than to thrust a stick through one 's cheek . Tribal names tended to fall away as the exclusiveness of the tribe weakened ; as a consequence , personal names alone remained . In the need for differentiating between man and man , however , the personal name ? so frequently duplicated ? was found to be insufficient . Descriptive names were then introduced to describe the bearer . These were at first limited to the lifetime of the bearer , but later they became hereditary . Heredity , however , was not always so simple as this . The fables of the children who devour their father ( as in the talc of Chronos , the god of time ) have a counterpart in primitive  | life . According to Herodotus there was a people in Scythia among whom it was a custom to devour one 's parents . Such practices among primitive tribes are not merely a macabre sort of gourmandism , nor the madness of famine . They represent a naive notion of the best way in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of course ? the eating of one 's kind ? is to be found among animals . The word is derived , supposedly , from Caribes , the Spanish plural of Carib , signifying a man-eating nation of the West Indies ; the root is more familiar to us as the name of the Caribbean sea . Shakespeare 's Caliban , it may be observed , probably owes his name to the same word , Carib , that gives us cannibalism . Caliban could mean a Cariban ; transpose two of the consonants of his name and you have Canibal , which is the word cannibal . Another variant , current in Shakespeare 's time , was Caribal . The changing of 1 to r or r or 1 we are already familiar with ; Spanish has canibal and caribal , standing alike for the native names of the Caribs or the Caribbees . Columbus used , as descriptive of the inhabitants of Haiti , canibales and caribes . Thus we have another instance of a word deriving from the name of a people and becoming a word that signifies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enemies not only as food , but as a manner of inheriting the heroic qualities of the foe . Just as costume took the place of bodily disfigurement , so in time one assumed a man 's name instead of digesting his remains . Dr. Polle mentions , in the book from which I have already quoted , another benign variation of such cannibalism . Among the South Sea islanders , he says , intimate friends exchange names in the belief that they thus exchange personalities and even establish common ownership of property . " Quand on parle du loud , " says the French proverb , " on en voit la queue . " " If you speak of the wolf , you can see his tail . " Or , as we say , " Speak of the devil , and he appears . " The sayings pay tribute to the evocative magic of speech . In order not to materialize one 's enemy , one does not mention his  | name . One introduces a euphemism or a circumlocution . The Russians must have had reason to fear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with their symbolical description of Russia . The Russian word for bear is medved , or honey-eater . ' We are told that among the Cherokees , when a man is bitten by a snake , he is said to have been " scratched by a briar . " To name the snake would be to hurt his feelings ! ( And therefore to anger him ? ) So the Malays fear to name the tiger , lest he answer to the call . So the Kaffirs will not name the lion when in danger of attack , and flatter the destructive porcupine with epithets such as " little woman " or " young lady . " 4 When the Greeks named the Furies the Eumenides ( that is , the benevolent , ' those of good will ' ) it was not only a euphemism by which the malevolent , those of ill will , were verbally transformed into their opposites ; it was also because , so doing , they would not have to pronounce the original name . So , too , night was called euphrone , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received its name . Originally it was called dxeinos , or inhospitable . ' Euxine means hospitable . ' It is curious to consider that the renaming was the result of a false etymology . The true original name was axsaena , or Black Sea . Axsaena was misinterpreted as axeinos . To-day the sea is named Black , and has thus reverted to its rightful name at last . Sailors may not be notoriously etymological in their habits , but it must have occurred to more than one of them , during a tempest on the Pacific , to wonder why that ocean received that name . It is in the category of oaths that we find a most interesting blend of taboo , euphemism , and circumlocution . Every language , old , new , savage , civilized , swears by its deities , but avoids naming the deities except under the most solemn circumstances . The taboo includes not only the deities but the temporal rulers , the kings . The Jewish conception of blasphemy , it will be remembered , includes the king ? that is , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be cursed or reviled . It was only at a later stage that the conception in- cluded also an interdiction against pronouncing the forbidden name of God . For God , like mortals , had a secret as well as a public name . Secret names were a protection against the use of one 's true name in evil magic . The tetragrammaton ( Greek tetra , ' four , ' and gramma , ' a letter ' ) describes the foul consonants forming the incommunicable name of the Lord . The name Christ is from the Greek christos , meaning ' annointed . ' It is a direct translation of the Hebrew mashiakh . The name Jesus ( Hebrew Yeshua ) is regarded as meaning ' Yahweh ( Jehovah ) is deliverance . ' Among many Christian peoples there is a psychological objection to bearing the name of Jesus , just as there is a psychological objection to bearing the name God . This objection corresponds to what , among primitive tribes , would be called taboo . A name associated so deeply with beings considered superhuman and sacred does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet this taboo is not universal . In Spanish , for example , Jesus is a fairly common name , as are other names with sacred connotations . Among women such names as Asuncion , Concepcion , Dolores , recall religious associations : the Assumption , the Conception , the Mother of Sorrows ( dolores ) . In German , the surname Gott is not unknown . This usage is not to be confused with such a combination as Gottlieb ( love of God ) or its Latin equivalent , Amadeus , common in Germany ; nor is it to be confused with such Spanish names as Juan de Dios ( John of God ) . The word for God , in oaths , is avoided just as the word for the name of a tribal chief is avoided by tribal taboo . When the Frenchman exclaims Morbleu ! or Corbleu ! he is using the sound bleu ( which seems to be the word for blue ) to replace that of Dieu , ' God . ' Morbleu stands for mort de Dieu , or ' death of God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! The possessive s of God 's is retained ; the tabooed clement is dropped . So , too , Zounds ! is a shortened form of God 's wounds ! with the God left off . In German , instead of Gott the sound Potz is employed , as in Potz Welt ( i. e. , ' God 's world ' ) , Potz Stern ( God 's star ) .  | Potz Blitz ( God 's lightning ) . Rather than say Teufel ( Devil ) , many avoid speaking of that spirit , and thus making him appear , by altering the word to Teuxel or Teixel , just as we say deuce or dickens , and as the Frenchman , instead of diable , says diantre . Gee whiz is a circumlocution for Jesus Christ ; by golly is by God ; by heck is either by hell , or by Nick , or an amalgamation of both ; the Dutch Potverdoeme is God verdoeme , or God damn . ' Our darn and dash and ding it are various ways of avoiding the word damn . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE SECOND BOOK OF THE HISTORY OF HERODOTUS OPENS with a famous passage : Now the Egyptians , before the reign of their king Psammetichus , believed themselves to be the most ancient of mankind . Since Psammetichus , however , made an attempt to discover who were actually the primitive race , they had been of the opinion that while they surpass all other nations , the Phrygians surpass them in antiquity . This king , finding it impossible to make out by dint of inquiry what men were the most ancient , contrived the following method of discovery : ? He took two children of the common sort , and gave them over to a herdsman to bring up at his folds , strictly charging him to let no one utter a word in their presence , but to keep them in a sequestered cottage , and from time to time introduce goats to their apartment , see that they got their fill of milk , and in all other respects look after them . His object was to know , after the instinctive babblings of infancy were over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he had anticipated . The herdsmen obeyed his orders for two years , and at the end of that time , on his one day opening the door of their room and going in , the children both ran up to him with outstretched arms , and distinctly said " bekos . " When this first happened the herdsman took no notice ; but afterwards when he observed , on coming often to see them , that the word was con- stantly in their mouths , he informed his lord , and by his command brought the children into his presence . Psammetichus then himself heard them say the word , upon which he proceeded to make inquiry what people called anything " bekos , " and hereupon he learned that " bekos " was the Phrygian name for bread . In consideration of this circumstance the Egyptians yielded their claims , and admitted the greater antiquity of the Phrygians . That these were the real facts I learnt at Memphis from the priests of Vulcan . The Greeks , among other foolish tales , relate that Psammetichus had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut out ; but the priests said their bringing up was such as I have stated above.2 The tale may have a core of truth , although the folklore of the world has many similar accounts of children brought up in the wilds , frequently with animals as their companions and even as their foster-mothers . Herodotus tells us that Cyrus was nursed and suckled by a bitch ; Romulus and Remus , the founders of Rome , were nursed supposedly by a she-wolf . These accounts have been recognized as testimony to the early kinship of man and beast . Frederick II of Sicily and James IV of Scotland are supposed to have performed similar experiments . From the linguistic point of view , however , the story repeated by Herodotus contains more than one instructive fallacy . Only by accident could two children reared apart from the rest of mankind pronounce a word that had a meaning in any language . Language is not inherited . The child of Greek parents who was born among the Eskimos would , unless specially instructed in the tongue of his father and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Eskimo parents who was born in Greece would as naturally grow up to speak Greek unless specially instructed in Eskimo , or withdrawn from Greek life and allowed to hear only Eskimo in his home . There was only one way in which the children of Psammetichus 's experiment could have learned the word bekos , and that was by hearing it spoken . Two children thus thrust  | together would doubtless , in time , have developed a system of communication ; two persons are a world-in-little . That system , however , would be of their own crude invention . Even under the conditions of civilization , children develop so-called secret languages ; the language of the children in the tale of Herodotus would not have come under this heading , for it would have been born of necessity . Nor would its meaning have been evident to King Psammetichus or his herdsman ; to understand the meaning would have required intensive study . How were these children to know what bread was ? Food they would know , but hardly the specific name of a specific food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense : the fact that two children figured in the experiment . Here , at least , is recognition of the social origins of language . Yet , for the results obtained , two were not necessary . Children babble , even without the presence of others . And , since the royal investigator appears to have believed in the hereditability of language , a solitary child might , just as well as two children , have babbled forth the word bekos . The word is not , moreover , such a word as would have developed in the normal intercourse between the children . They did not receive their food from each other ; they received it from the herdsman . Indeed , they received it more directly from the goat , and there is no reason why they should not have spoken rather to the goat than to their humble custodian , since the custodian was forbidden to utter a word in their presence . The goat may well have " spoken " as they drank at his udders ; one theory , indeed , seeking to account for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ echo of the brute 's voice . This is more scientific than belief in the tale as told . Yet that tale has found among some linguists , if not acceptance , a certain credence .  | It is the child who appears , with its infantile babbling , to have provided the fairly universal words for itself and for its parents . Ma and pa are variations of a single vocal activity ? that of forcing breath through the lips , or even of sucking it in . M is pronounced with a closing of the lips , the voice issuing from the nose ; p is formed by tightening the lips and expelling the breath between them . B is a softer , a voiced p . From the earliest sounds made by the infant in its chief activity , that of suckling , come the names pa and ma and their multitudinous variants . Mamma is but a reduplication of ma , as papa is of pa . Reduplication is a common habit among children ; originally it is simply the repetition of a sound that has caught @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various muscles concerned with breathing and talking . To one another we say , " Good-bye " ; to a child we say , in imitation of its own early habits , " We 'll go bye-bye . " To one another we say , " Good night " ; to a child , or to one another in jesting moments , we say , " Nightie-nightie . " Or , if it has been mischievous , " Naughty-naughty . " Once the words for mother and father were established , the extension of meaning to which all words are subject would operate with special fertility upon such central terms . The breasts are called mammary glands . Animals who suckle their young are called mammals . Italian bambino or bimbo stands for baby . ' Babbo is father ' ; poppa is mother 's breast , ' as is the French , poupon . Latin amma is nurse ' ; amita is aunt . ' Papilla is bosom . ' So is mamilla . German Amme is nurse ' ; Spanish and Portuguese ama is housewife ' ; amo is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Latin amo ( I love ) appears . " Out of the mouths of babes . . . . Carnoy believes that the Latin lullaby , ninna nanna , provided the Spanish word nino , infant , ' as well as the Italian nonna , grandmother , ' and the French nonne . In Spanish ,  | one of the phrases for to sleep ' is hacer la nana ( to make nana ) . Nun is a variant of such terms as nonna and nonne . In the matter of words that are attributable to the babble of infancy it is easy , in specific instances , to go astray . We do not , and we can not , know what a primitive baby was like . Moreover , was it the baby ? even the primitive baby ? who learned from the mother , or the mother who was taught by the child ? For linguistic purposes , it is perhaps wise to consider mother and child as a unified pair . This agreed upon , it is nevertheless a reasonable conclusion that much of the baby-mama-papa vocabulary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the syllables ba , ma , pa were associated with the ideas of baby , mother and father , their later development was bound to take courses that would , by association , lead to complicated linguistic results . The child , thus considered , must have been one of the earliest sources of echoism . To call a dog a bow-wow sounds , even to contemporary ears , like a pleasant conspiracy between mother and child . Such words as pigeon , which is a development of the people 's Latin pipio , have been regarded as children 's echoisms ; so , too , the Sanskrit kurkura , meaning dog . ' The fact that the words for mother and father reveal striking similarities in many tongues does not , of itself , argue for their origin in baby 's prattling . Once a word is established , its later fate depends upon the changes caused by usage . Baby 's creative association with it has ended . Thus , whatever the original sound that resulted in such roots as ma and pa , the Greek words mater and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their beginnings in the infant 's mouth . And so do all words for mother and father . The idea of maternity , paternity and offspring is naturally one of the basic notions of humanity , and the associations thus established will as naturally show in the outbranchings of words . An amusing example of such association is afforded by recent race-track history . The off- spring of that phenomenal racer , Man-o ' - War , was named Battleship . The verbal development of mother and father relationships , as of sex relationships , reaches into every department of thought . We have , in poetry , male and female rhymes ; we have , in plumbing , male and female jointures . We have mother-tongues and fatherlands . A patriot is a member of a patria , which is Latin for fatherland . ' ( Latin pater , father , ' is from the Greek word of similar sound , as is Latin mater from the slightly different Greek mater . ) Such terms as paternity and maternity , or , to give them their Teutonic forms , fatherhood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lip-fumbling , just as far as lallation is from the halfhelpless la-la of the baby . A matrix is , at first , a womb ? the mother-mold , as it were . From this primary meaning it is easy to see how it was predestined to mean any type of mold . It is thus not too fanciful to accept the suggestion that the word matter ( Latin materia ) is intimately associated with the word for mother ' ( mater ) . Matter , thus regarded , would be the mother-stuff of the universe . From materia as the motherstuff of the universe it is an easy step to the Spanish and Portuguese words for wood : madera and madeira , respectively . For wood was , and remains , one of the essential substances in the world . It must once have appeared to some men as the substance . Observe now the capricious manner in which matter evolves . Madeira , to us , as English-speaking persons , suggests not wood but wine or lace . How does this come about ? There is , near Morocco @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named because it is well wooded . Because the spelling of the name is Portuguese rather than Spanish , we may suspect that it was the Portuguese who discovered it . On that island is made , among other things , wine . Among those other things made is a type of embroidery ; hence the name Madeira for the wine and for the work done by the nuns of Madeira . There is even a Madeira wood ? the mahogany of the island . Madeira  | wood is much like saying , if one thinks etymologically , wood wood ; the truth of the matter is , however , that we talk with words , not with etymologies . Father-words are as numerous as mother-words , and are subject to the same evolutionary changes . Greek pdppos means grandfather ' ; it means also " the first down on youth 's cheek " ? that is , the first token of manhood . Papparium ( Latin ) signifies pap . ' Papai , in Sardinian , means to eat . ' German pappe is paste , ' or pasteboard , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' The most glorified form of the syllable pa is the capitalized word Pope . In another linguistic direction the same infantile syllable becomes Father , which is what Pope means . In no other way did the word abbot , ' spiritual father ' ( Greek abbas ) , arise . That childish babbling should , in the course of time , provide such exalted notions as these , should be no more surprising than that primitive man should have produced language in the first place . The child is father to the man ; and man is father to language . The child plays with its muscles , and the tongue is a muscle . Once it has learned that vocalism has other possibilities than those of summoning food or assistance , it explores these possibilities . Children are fond of playing with words , of distorting them , of varying them , of making nonsense rhymes and hearing them , of inventing secret languages . Perhaps we have here the origin of some of the delight ? surely not all ? that adults take in alliteration and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ verbal trickery . Perhaps there is some connection , too , between the speech of children and the disturbances of speech that occur in adults . Children and the so-called primitive peoples appear to share a habit of chatter for chatter 's sake ; that habit resembles what is called , by psychiatrists , verbigeration , or an uncontrolled repetition of words or sentences . The attempts of Gertrude  | Stein to make artistic employment of what to many of us looks like an almost phonographic iteration suggests at one end the chatter of children and at the other the verbigeration of an unfortunate adult . Chamberlain quotes a case from the records of Drs . Peterson and Langdon in which a woman , after a phase in which she rhymed all day long , proceeded to verbigerations such as " I want to go home to my children in New York ; wo n't I be glad when I get home to my children in New York ! What good times I 'll have when I get home to my children in New York ! . . . to my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get into the car which takes me to my husband and children in New York . " It reads like the work of a precursor of Gertrude Stein , except that it is slightly more interesting than " a rose is a rose is a rose . " Jespersen reports from his readings a Danish girl of three who had a " curious knack of twisting all words into rimes : bestemor hestemor prestemore , Gudrun sludrun pludrun . " This parallels exactly the case of the woman I have just mentioned , who , in her rhyming or assonantal phase , would repeat such a series as " moccasins , vocassins , doccasins . . . " or " babies , tabies , gabies , sabies. . . . " 3 The so-called secret languages of children are found all over the world . They represent largely a more systematic distortion of words . A simple plan is at the basis , as may readily be deduced from the common practice of the children that we know . Areway ouyay oingway outway ? ( Are you going out ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ word , and adds way ; in case the word begins with a vowel , the way is added directly . When I was a child in Boston , and the era of rag-time was upon us , we spoke a tongue in which What are you doing ? was transmogrified into whagadat agadare yagadou dagadoing ? The trick was to break the vowel by inserting a gad.4  | In French there is the loucherbeme language , so called because its model of transformed words is Boucher . The initial consonant is moved to the end , and em is added ; 1 is prefixed to the resulting word . Then there is the largonji , which is simply jargon , with the initial consonant transposed to final position and i added , while an 1 is prefixed to the resulting word . Mourne is the name of a Savoyard jargon that turns chambre into brachanna , quatre into treca , clocher into chiclo , and so on . In Spanish , Germania practices a similar inversion : pecho gives chepo ; negro gives greno . In Germany there is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our own rag-time speech . Ich habe ein Hut ( I have a hat ) becomes Ipich hapabep eipepen Huput.5 These " secret " languages are not to be confused with what looks like a more genuine type of children 's language , such as develops when children , through one circumstance or another , are left much alone . The " secret " languages are not new creations ; they are founded , for the greater part , upon the language that the children already know , but are more flexible than the children 's tongues . Children 's languages probably contain many onamotopes ; they practise wilful distortion , as in one language of Boston children who turned every adverbial ending ly into losh , so that terribly became terriblosh . But " a certain percentage of words were absolutely independent , or at least of obscure origin . The grammar tended to Chinese or infantine simplicity ; to represented any case of any personal pronoun. " s Twins have been known to develop a sort of lingua franca that their own parents could not understand . Just why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can invent words is difficult to appreciate . Even between tots there may be a sort of crude intercourse out of which evolves a reciprocally understandable sound . This is  | enough to create a word . The evolution of the great languages is in the same tradition . That which segregates groups speaking the same language tends to introduce differences into that language . Any group within the larger group tends , through certain common interests , to evolve a dialect of the language spoken by the larger group . The talk of children is very little different , essentially , from " shop " talk or professional chat ; it represents a specialized interest . Jespersen , a cautious yet very human scientist , is not inclined to accept mystical explanations . He smiles , for example , at Grimm 's elucidation of certain fundamental changes in German pronunciation on the score of the Germans ' love for liberty . He smiles equally upon the heroic character of the Vikings as the explanation of the great linguistic changes that took place in the Scandinavian languages during the Viking age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recondite , just as he does for the difference in the language of the educated Londoner and the London poor : " the men were absent and the women had other things to attend to than their children 's linguistic education . I am also inclined to think , " he continues , " that the unparalleled rapidity with which , during the last hundred years , the vulgar speech of the English cities has been differentiated from the language of the educated classes ( nearly all long vowels being shifted , etc. ) finds its natural explanation in the unexampled misery of child-life among industrial workers in the first half of the last century ? one of the most disgraceful blots on our overpraised civilization . " 7 The slang of grown-ups , especially in its self-conscious phases , reveals a delight in linguistic play that has its relationship to the play of children with speech , and to the specialized tongues of which I have just spoken . There are far more languages than we realize ; in a sense , everyone 's language has its individuality , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The child begins to speak , generally , during its third year ? that is , between two and three years of age . It is , and not only so far as concerns the acquisition of language , at this stage an imitative animal . Its hearing is , even if acute , unskilled . Its breath control and its speech organs are immature . Its teeth will later give way to a second set , which will find a larger mouth ? that is , a larger resonance chamber ? to occupy . Its tongue is without the skill that it is to attain ? perhaps excessively ! ? in its years of maturity . In a few words , the child 's phonetic ( i. e. sound-producing ) system , whether regarded from the psychological or the physiological point of view , is in a transitional state . For this reason , incidentally , it is hardly wise for fond parents or relations to talk " baby " talk to a child . " Baby " talk , strictly speaking is adult talk , not " baby " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to reproduce the sounds that he is hearing from his elders . To have impressed upon his mind , at a time when he is finding it hard enough to reproduce the sounds of his native tongue , another set of sounds that confirm him in his inevitable errors of reproduction , is to do him a disservice . Let the " baby " talk pass , however ; it has its uses for exclusive employment by adolescents , and by lovers in moments of intimacy that should not be overheard . The child , during its early years , when there is being established the phonetic system that is to be his during the rest of his life , is establishing at the same time a series of organic movements . He is establishing also a special ear-training for the sounds of his native speech . That is why it is to be so relatively difficult for him in the years of his adulthood to learn how to hear and how to speak a foreign language . His ear and his speech organs are , to use the newest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sounds and the muscular motions of his own language .  | It will be observed that I mention the hearing as well as the speaking . The man or woman learning a foreign tongue is doing double work , as it were . He is , for the moment , trying to forget his own language , and trying to hear the new one with the unspoiled ears of the child . He hears imperfectly , for the sound-system , the phonetics , of his native language inevitably come between him and the new system . He reproduces imperfectly , not only because he has heard imperfectly , but because his vocal mechanism has been trained to reproduce the special sounds of his native language , not the new set of sounds . This is one reason why some persons who pride themselves upon speaking this or that language without an accent are so easily detected as foreigners by a person habitually using the other language . In the inevitable differences between the manner in which a child hears and reproduces its native tongue and the manner in which its parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ causes of linguistic change . This theory has been discredited . The frequently perceptible differences between one generation and another are to be sought , then , in other , more basic , causes . More important for language may be the child 's habit of reduplicating sounds : pa becomes papa ; ma , mamma ; dad , dada ; the smoking of a cigarette , foo-foo ; food , nyam-n yam . Nicknames and pet names often show the same reduplication ; Gigi for Italian Luigi ; Beppo for Giuseppe ; Lola for Spanish Dolores . What relation , if any , this may have to the reduplicated stems of Greek and Latin verbs I do not know . The child 's duplications appear to occur on the accented syllables . Children shorten many words by dropping the syllables before the accent : bil for automobile , as accented on that syllable ; tina for concertina , and so on . This may be because , as has been said , the child can handle monosyllables or short words ; it may also be because he hears or concentrates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , ' varsity and ' backy ( tobacco ) are not children 's words . We are inclined to smile indulgently at the mistakes made by our children while they are learning to speak . Their trouble with irregular plurals , with irregular verbs , with irrational spellings , with all the irregularities , indeed , that gave us so much bother in our own childhood , arouses fond memories and evokes a tenderly didactic emotion . Is it we , really , who at such moments are teaching our children ? Or is it they , if we but had the discernment to discover it , who are teaching us ? Does their helplessness in the face of these linguistic and orthographic curiosities point to a day when the human race , and not only its children , will demand of language and of spelling a determined correction of the irregularities that have been complacently taken over from less rebellious and less exigent forerunners ? The difficulties of the child with grammar , spelling and other aspects of language are not all inherent in the nature of the subject @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day be remedied . Here , too , a little child may lead us . If there are children 's languages , and if the child has a definite effect upon language as a whole , there are women 's languages , too , with a definite effect of woman upon language as a whole . Consider the effect upon language of such tribal customs as obtain in certain parts of the tropics , where , after the birth of a child , all intimacy between the parents ceases for some three years . The result of such a taboo is that two distinct societies are created within the social group . On the one hand there is the maternal society , consisting of mother and child ; on the other , the paternal society , consisting of the father and , in Melanesia , the younger men who have not yet  | found wives . One of the groups is distinctly feminine ; the other , as distinctly male . The prolonged suckling of the infant , resulting in a close association between mother and child , to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ special language-group in which the father does not figure . So , too , the prolonged association of the males would tend to give to their dialect of the native speech a decidedly male cast . There are other reasons for a distinctly feminine dialect of a primitive tongue : linguistic taboo . As man may not pronounce the name of his Lord , so , in many earlier cultures , woman may not pronounce the name of her man or of his father . A woman who must not pronounce the name of her father-in-law or his brothers must be careful , too , not to pronounce any word that sounds like that name . As a result , a complicated system of circumlocutions will arise , and words will be twisted out of their normal sounds . The evidence of anthropology on this score is overwhelming . Women , among the Amazulus , in order to avoid mention of their husbands ' names , refer to them as " Father of so-and-so " ? that is , of one of their children . Among the Kaffirs , no word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be pronounced by the wife . The rules differ from one savage tribe to another , but the general principle of a male name-taboo enforced against woman persists . Let us suppose that this taboo was part of our own culture . A certain woman 's husband is named Jimmy ; her father-inlaw is named Henry . At once the word jimmy , meaning a short crowbar , would disappear from her vocabulary , as would such a word as hennery and perhaps , in time , henna . She could not indulge in such a harmless oath as By Jiminy , which goes back to the Latin Gemini , or twins ' ( Castor and Pollux ) , who form one of the signs of the Zodiac . She might even fear , in time , to speak of jimson-weeds ( jimson comes from Jamestown ) . When it is remembered that men have many names , it will be seen that the vocabulary of womankind , under such  | Such a habit of mind , furthermore , could not be without its effect upon life in general ; indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all living . There are other , less primitive , types of women 's languages , or of languages affected deeply by the psychology of womankind . Yiddish is a dialect of Middle High German , with a documented history of some five hundred years . One of its names is Weiber-Teutsch , or women 's German . ' Why is this ? For long it was considered a disgrace for a male to have recourse , especially in print , to Yiddish . He was supposed to be intimately conversant with the holy tongue , Hebrew , which is a member of the ancient Semitic family . Women , who were not required to know Hebrew , could read their prayers in the language of the folk , Yiddish . Hence the designation women 's German . For a man to read prayers in Yiddish meant ignorance of Hebrew , which was a major crime against culture . In a similar category of cultural division is the custom , in Sanskrit drama , of having the women and the lower order of men talk Prakrit and the noble males Sanskrit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; Yiddish and Hebrew are two different languages , whereas Prakrit and Sanskrit are , respectively , a later and an earlier phase of the same tongue . A similar example of linguistic division , applied culturally rather than sexually , is the age-old battle between Latin and the vernacular . Latin , as the language of religion and culture , acquired the dignity that goes with church and university . The vernacular was the language of the common people , and the almost faded mark of this subordination appears in the very etymology of the word : vernacular is from verna , a slave born in his master 's house , ' from which the adjective acquired the meaning of native or indigenous . In an important sense all languages have , even to-day , a woman 's language and a man 's , just as they have a children 's language . Between the approach of woman to speech and of man to speech there seems to be an inherent difference based upon sexual psychology .  | The influence of woman upon language , whether in the early days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own day , must be regarded as enormous . I must confess that I can not at all understand how so progressive a spirit as Madvig could have written that woman had no share in the framing of our first languages . She affects , and can not help affecting , such diverse aspects as intonation , formation and choice of words , attitudes . It is possible , in fact , that she affects them too much ; or , to state the same idea differently , that man , in the early file of our children , affects these aspects too little . Woman is the school-teacher of the early grades ; women are the governesses , and otherwise substitute for the mother ; the child in its formative years sees more of women than of men ? indeed , than of its own father . This must have its psychological , as its linguistic , effects . As there are typically childish expressions , so there is a typically feminine imprint upon language . This is all as it should be . The conditions that produce child expressions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exaggerated , produce children 's languages and women 's languages . Such languages are less likely to develop in civilized communities . A suggestion of the forces that lie behind them is to be gleaned from the specifically feminine vocabulary of our own time , or even of our own circle . Much intimate talk among women is addicted to niceties that approach the status of finickiness , or to forms that assume the presence of tender children . Nice is not , to many ears , a masculine word ; neither are cute and cunning , nor any number that the reader may call to mind . Such formations as dydee for diaper , nightie for nightgown , suggest at once a feminine origin or , certainly , feminine adoption . Hankies for handkerchiefs , panties for certain " inexpressibles " or " unmentionables , " booties for infants ' footwear , goodies for candy , goody-goody ! as an expression of gladness , lingerie for underwear , all suggest feminine influence . Itsy-bitsy ( little bit ) , teeny-weeny ( tiny and wee ) or teensy-weensy , are feminine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course . Lingerie , besides being a euphe- mism , suggests also a class distinction . The poor do not wear lingerie . Among the niceties that seem to bear the imprint of feminine origin are such words as abdomen for belly ; in the common mispronunciation that places the accent upon the first syllable instead of upon the o , there seems to be a symbolic evasion of that belly-like vowel . Woman has been regarded as generally more conservative than man , and not only in language . She seems , from childhood , instinctively more histrionic , more eager to please , more inclined toward doing and saying the " right " thing , the pleasant thing . In pronunciation , unless there are special reasons to the contrary , she is more a purist than man , adhering more closely to the " right " sounds and avoiding the introduction of new matter . The addiction of women the world over to the use of emphatic or intensive words is a linguistic phase of a trait that marks the sex ; its written phase is the habit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employ a more ceremonial style than men , and are more given to what might be called the etiquette of language . Expressions such as frightfully interesting , or terribly good , or too too divine or utterly disgusting , suggest original use by women . The word awful , in its primal meaning , stood for full of awe , ' just as terribly suggested , at first , terror , and divine suggested divinity , and frightful suggested fright . Continued use of such words to qualify rather ordinary events or feelings led naturally to their weakening . To-day , if we really mean awful or frightful we have to cast about for other words . All this , certainly , should be no more surprising than that women wear different clothes from those of men . Or , for that matter , that women are more likely to make regular use of diminutives than are men . Or that women 's pitch of voice should be higher than that of men . The instrument ( the vocal organic mechanism ) is slightly different in the case of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the language spoken by a man and woman of the same tongue .  | The use of diminutives is second nature with a mother addressing her child . So it is with the father , except that he does not seem to carry the habit into his other human relationships . The same instinct that leads lovers to converse in baby talk leads them also to make excessive use ( for the outside ear ) of diminutives . Children adopt a like linguistic attitude toward themselves and toward their pets , animate and inanimate . Mantegazza , as quoted by Chamberlain , 8 explains this use of diminutives as part of the " desire to merge oneself in another , to abase oneself , to aggrandize the beloved . " In any case , there is an attempt to make ourselves smaller , as if bending down to , or over , the tiny object . Classical scholars will perhaps call to mind the famous lines of Catullus : Animula vagula blandula in which the diminutives in la have a felicitous ( and perhaps not altogether accidental ) suggestion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon " Woman and Language , " ? looks upon woman as the one who gave to primitive chattering the fixed quality of words . She rebelled , as one too busy , against the constant renewal of meanings , and therefore against novelty . Woman becomes , in this essay that sometimes overflows into poetic mysticism , " language incarnate . " Woman becomes , moreover , the inventor of the " lie , " which is " the very basis of language and its absolute condition . " The use of the word lie in such a connection is unfortunate and misleading . A metaphor is certainly a transposition of reality , but it is not a premeditated falsehood . Even De Gourmont finds it necessary to qualify his word : " Lie , let it be understood , here signifies the expression of an imaginary sensation . It is a matter of psychology , not of morality ? separate domains . " Psychologists recognize " psychopathic lying , " which is an illness rather than an attempt at deception . The kind of " lie " at which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ art than to what we call deception . It is a practice not at all confined to woman . There is " lying " among young children , too , and a much misunderstood habit it is . Youngsters of five , let us say , who have hardly had the time to develop , or to acquire from their elders , an ethical attitude toward the universe , play with ideas just as , in their infant days , they played with sounds . The play instinct does not cease with elementary and exploratory motions of muscles , with rudimentary exercise of the vocal organs . Once ideas appear , they , too , are played with . To grown-ups , nonsense is a temporary release from the inexorable laws that govern the universe . We respond to Walt Disney 's animations on the screen , to Lewis Carroll 's Alice , to the topsy-turvyland of Gilbert and Sullivan , because , for one thing , they carry us back to the irresponsibility of childhood . If the child , in his play with speech and with ideas , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gilbert and Sullivan " lie . " This is a sorry conception of lying . " At first , " writes Dr. B. A. Hinsdale , " the child has no more idea of telling the truth with his tongue than he has of telling it with his eyelids or his toes . " 10 Yet in a number of important respects the opinions of the folk and of the linguistic specialists find agreement : women have the linguistic gift ? that is , they " take " more quickly to words than do men ; they talk more ; they hear more ; they answer more quickly . " A man is slower : he hesitates , he chews the cud to make sure of the taste of words , and thereby comes to discover similarities with and differences from other words , both in sound and sense , thus preparing himself for the appropriate use of the fittest noun or adjective . " 11 This may explain why man , and not woman , has achieved such high distinction in linguistics . Precisely because woman is quicker with words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less likely to develop a scientific attitude toward them . She is interested in concrete matters . Man is more in- clined toward abstraction . Woman may thus be regarded as the talker par excellence , and man as the codifier of talk . Woman is loquacious ; man is linguistic . How such an outlook squares with the practices of contemporary diplomacy , and how the conception of woman as the original " liar " squares with the characteristics of that same diplomacy , it is embarrassing to say . Diploma is from Greek diploos , twofold ' ; duplicity is from Latin duo , two ' and plicare , to fold . ' I do not , however , draw any deductions from this twofold etymology .  | FROM THE MOMENT THAT THE LAYMAN BECOMES CONscious of his voice he is a phonetician of sorts . He does not , to be sure , know the terminology of the science , but terminology ? especially when the reasons for it are understood ? is easy to acquire . He does know , however , much more about the voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valuable kind of knowledge ; it is based upon practical experience . After all , the layman has been talking since he was born . He has also ? let us hope ? been listening . He can distinguish persons by their voices ? soft voices , harsh ones , high-pitched , low-pitched , musical , grating , and so on into a surprisingly long list of classifications . He knows much , too , about the types of sound that go to make up the significant noises called words . He may not be able to define a vowel , but he knows that there are sounds made by simply opening the mouth and forcing breath from the lungs through the vocal cords . That the word vowel is derived from the Latin vox , vocis , meaning voice , ' 1 and more directly from vocalis , meaning vocal , ' he need not know , although such knowledge , by giving a definite name to a phenomenon , helps to clarify the experience and make it easier to talk and reason about .  | The layman knows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? that in making them the lips are frequently closed , with or without the cooperation of the nasal passages . He really does not have to be told that there is a difference between a p and a b ? that the p is made in much the same way as the b , by placing the lips together , but that the b has voice , while the p has none . He has a fairly definite notion that g comes somewhere from the back of his mouth , near the throat , with voice , while k comes from the same region , but without voice . If he is somewhat more observant than his neighbor , or if he has had teeth removed and replaced , he knows that certain other sounds ? t , d , s , th , for example ? require the collaboration of the teeth . If he watches his tongue , he will find that as he speaks it touches now his palate , now his teeth , now his gums . Speaking is easy ? often much too easy . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter ; so is the psychology of speech . It is a mistake to think of the mechanism and the psychology as of separable , distinct elements ; they are different aspects of a complicated organism . It is quite as great an error to separate the organs that take part in speech from the mind that is associated with those organs ? as great an error , indeed , as it is to separate the emotions and the intellect . Such distinctions are useful for study ; but we must not fall into the too common error that because we can separate events or actions into distinct words , therefore the events or the actions themselves are separable . If we did not possess what we call our vocal mechanism , we could not speak , regardless of the mind . If we did not possess a mind , we could not speak , regardless of our vocal mechanism . There is no reason to believe that our voices were made for the purpose of speech . We have , in the course of uncounted ages , adapted our vocal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to technological craft . The study of speech ? how human sounds are produced , how they are modified in the individual and the crowd , how they act upon each other ? has been made to appear highly  | technical and , for the average man and woman , all but forbidding . We may frankly admit that , of all the branches of language , it presents , even outwardly , the most alienating aspect . This is to be regretted , and for more than one reason . Phonetics , in its deeper implications , is not child 's play , surely ; but neither is it an impenetrable mystery . As a specialty in linguistics it demands intense application , scientific detachment , and the ability to concern oneself with seemingly dry details . Yet for the layman it has , without being denatured , its agreeable excitements . Without the development of this science by patient , and even heroic , investigators , we should still be in a fog of loose conjecture about languages and their relationship to one another , unable to appreciate the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize a distinction between phonetics and phonology . According to this distinction , phonology is the more inclusive term , embracing the history and theory of sound changes in general . Phonetics deals with the analysis and classification of the speech-sounds themselves . Speech-sounds are named , by specialists , according to those parts of the speech-mechanism that are employed in making them . The system of nomenclature is really simple , however formidable the names may appear at first . Even the names are simple , once the general reader learns what they mean . It happens , as in many other pursuits than the study of speechsounds , that there is more than one name for the same occurrence . This , to a beginner , may prove confusing . The possibility of confusion disappears , however , as the reasons for the names become evident and as the names themselves become familiar . Phonetics , as the title of a science , has a somewhat forbidding sound . The science itself , however , is far more interesting and far less formidable than its title . Phone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combinations in which it is met . Phonetos is Greek for to be spoken . ' Phonetikos is the same word with the adjectival ending ikos ( our suffix - ic ) . Phonetics is as simple a word as ath- letics . How many persons , unskilled in linguistics , know that an athlete is a contender for a prize ? that his English name derives from the Greek athletes , which in turn is related to athlein , ' to contend for a prize ' ? that athlos is a contest , ' and athlon the ' prize ' awarded in the contest ? For every such person , dozens of average persons know that all words in which phon- is an element have reference to sound : phonograph , telephone , which , respectively , denote sound-writing and transmission of sound across distance ( literally , ' far-sounding ' ) . The phonograph is an instrument that records ( writes down ) sound . More precisely speaking , the phonograph is an instrument for reproducing the sound thus recorded ; the recording is in the wax record . Phonography @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of the same metaphor : the recording of sound . Only that phonography , thus interpreted , is , precisely speaking , not the recording of sound but the symbolic representation of the sound . The wax record actually records ; shorthand represents by symbols that require translation . So , for that matter , does ordinary writing . Stenography , as a term for shorthand , is somewhat better ( because more precise and less confusing ) than phonography . Steno is from a Greek word meaning ' narrow ' ; stenography is thus narrow ( that is , condensed ) writing . One of the new applications of the typewriter is to the typing of stenographic symbols ; this is called stenotypy- the typing ( instead of the writing ) of stenography . Consider what formidable words stenography and stenographer would have been , had not the activity and the agent for which they stand become so common in our everyday commercial life . When one considers how easy it is to look up a word , it is astounding to realize how many otherwise intelligent persons go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phenomenon of sound , it is subject to the general laws of sound production . To this study , in its larger aspects , is given the name acoustics , from Greek akouo , meaning ' I hear . ' So far as concerns phonetics , the student of language need know of acoustics only what , again , he has already  | observed pragmatically . He knows that if he strikes , for example , a thick glass it will give out a sound lower than the one emitted under the same circumstances by a thin glass . He knows that the tighter he stretches a string , the higher the tone it will give forth when plucked ; he knows that a long tube of a certain width will give out a deeper tone than a short tube of the same bore . In other words , he has pragmatic ( that is , experiential ) acquaintance with the relation between the pitch of sound and the tension , thickness and length of the vibrating medium . The greater the tension , the thinner the material , the shorter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps it would be better to think of our two vocal cords as lips or reeds rather than as cords . For these lips , the vibrations of which produce voice , are not simple strings , such as those on a violin . The strings of the violin can not , as the vocal lips can , contract and lengthen at will , become thinner or thicker under the influence of emotion . The violin has to have four strings , of differing thickness ; the strings , moreover , have to be shortened by placing the fingers upon them and thus limiting the portion that vibrates under the bow . Placing the fingers upon the string produces a stop . The unstopped string is called open . Such an instrument as the piano requires , for the same purposes , a multitude of strings , increasing in length and thickness . Each string can give out but a single tone , varying in duration and intensity according to the skill of the player in striking the key and employing the pedals . The vocal lips , on the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adjustments of length and thickness automatically , with a startling dynamic flexibility . Did we not use it daily , without thought of how it works , we should not cease to marvel at it . If the voice were not thus adaptable , it would be unbearably monotonous . Expression , in the sense of finely shaded tone , would be all but unknown . The fundamental qualities of the human voice are the qualities of any other musical instrument . It has variability of pitch , varying intensity of volume , the capability of maintaining itself ( i. e. , duration ) . Change of pitch is a matter of  | vibrations ; the greater the number of vibrations , the higher the tone . Intensity of sound is directly proportional to fulness , or amplitude , of vibration . If the sound of middle C is caused by 221 vibrations per second , the relative loudness of the tone depends , not upon a change in the number of vibrations , but upon their width . Pluck a violin string ? say the thickest of the four . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle C. Pluck it softly and the sound is soft ; pluck it hard , and you can see that , although the pitch is the same , the string is vibrating across a wider space , like a pendulum that swings through a wider arc but takes the same time covering that wider arc that it takes in covering a narrower one . The tone-quality of the voice , as of any other musical instrument , is determined by what are called overtones . The student of phonetics need not know as much about overtones as does the acoustician or even the well-informed musician . A nodding acquaintance , however , will prove useful . Vibrations are never simple . Strings or vocal cords do not vibrate only in their entire length ; neither does a column of air in a tube . Vibrating objects vibrate also in their parts , and these parts give out tones also . The tones are not so strong as the tone of the entire length ; they are called overtones ? tone given forth above or over the basic or fundamental tone . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upper tones resulting from the vibrations of parts , not of wholes . Yet another name is harmonics . The quality of the human voice is complicated by the fact that it is magnified ( much as the sounds of the strings are magnified by the hollow box of the violin ) in the oral chamber , the inside of the mouth . The oral chamber , unlike the inside of a violin box , consists of many different materials : teeth , hard and soft palate , fleshy , moist insides of the cheeks . These materials are of varying degrees of hardness and of moisture , and the resonance ( i. e. , the re-sounding ) therefore is complicated beyond that of the simpler resonance to be encountered in the ordinary musical instrument . We can all sing or speak tones of a certain pitch ; we can all  | make them loud or soft ; we can all make them last long or for a short period . Each of us , however , has a distinctly personal quality of voice , and this depends , among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oral chamber , and the peculiarity of our vocal cords , reeds , or lips . The human voice has been reproduced mechanically . Sometime during the middle of January , 1938 , Sir Richard Paget , whose gesture theory of language was considered in an earlier chapter , broadcast from London to the United States the speech of a mechanical apparatus . As reported in the magazine Time , the apparatus was " largely a metal and fabric tube which has parts corresponding to the larynx , tongue and palate . He gets recognizable syllables by various arrangements of his hands on the mouthpieces . Air is furnished by a bellows which he operates with his foot . " The instrument was made to say such sounds as " Oh , Lila , I love you , " " Hello , London , are you there ? " and " Minnie . . . father . . . upper . . . rather . . . ta-ta ! " These words were pronounced in a " queer , blurred , atonal voice like that of a person who has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to reproduce exactly the physical conditions under which the human organs of speech do their work , the approximation to human speech would have been closer , but it would still have been far from perfect , since no instrument can duplicate the workings of the human mind and the emotions while speech is going on . Thus it must fail to capture the subtle effects of mind upon voice . Linguistic treatises intended for formal study give diagrams of the vocal mechanism , and go into such detail as one expects from a work on human anatomy . In a book of this nature , however , the anatomy of speech organs is less important than the constant awareness that the vocal lips , and the various organs cooperating with them in speech , make certain sounds in a certain way .  | What are these sounds ? How are they made ? And under what circumstances do they change ? The answer to these questions includes much of the history of language . Let me , at this point , urge a certain caution upon the reader . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is of the utmost importance , and much havoc has been wrought in the history of linguistic investigation because even highly capable scholars have overlooked it or kept it imperfectly in mind . Phonetics , as the name indicates , deals with sounds . Not with letters , but with sounds ; not with spelling , but with combinations of sound . Since the invention of writing ? one of the epochal developments of the human intelligence ? we have become increasingly a people of readers rather than talker-listeners ; we have , that is , become script- and print-minded , rather than voice- and speech-minded . We say and write such things as that German pf ( as in Pflug , plow ' ) becomes , in English , p , as in plow . We are so dependent upon writing and printing for the conveying of information that we easily forget an essential fact : written symbols represent sounds . Written symbols are imperfect representations of sounds ; all linguistic symbols are imperfect . A letter is no more a sound than a note , on paper , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of teaching phonetics in print is that we have to employ silent symbols for live sounds . This is as hard as to teach music by the use of the printed page alone , without illustrations on the piano , the phonograph , or the radio . Another difficulty is that phoneticians have not yet agreed upon a clear , unambiguous terminology . How treacherous the written symbol may be to even great linguistic intelligences is shown by Jacob Grimm in the second edition of his Deutsche Grammatik ( German Grammar ) . Here he writes that the German word Schri f t ( writing ' ; our word script ) , contains eight sounds ! How does Grimm obtain eight sounds from this seven-letter word ? The letter f he counts as two , since f ( or a sound resembling it ) is expressed in Greek by ph ( that is , by a symbol , 0 , which we transliterate as ph ) .  | Small wonder that one historian , transcribing such phonetics as this , labels the example an atrocity ! Sch is the German way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represented by sh . As well say that sh consists of two sounds as to say that sch consists of three , because German happens to employ three characters . Or that French ch , which represents practically the same sound , consists of two sounds because it consists of two letters . Portuguese nh , as in the word senhor , is sounded like the Spanish n . In the case of Spanish the tilde over the n indicates palatalization ; in the case of the Portuguese the h after n indicates precisely the same palatalization . Therefore , if we were to fall into Grimm 's simplicity , we should have to say that the same sound consists of two elements in Portuguese and of one in Spanish . Grimm , to be sure , lived in an age that was less enlightened , from the point of view of phonetics , than is our own . Analysis of speech-sounds is much better made on the basis of phonograph records , or from studies of vibrations as registered upon sensitized material by delicate apparatus : the kymograph ( Greek @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sphygmos , pulse ' ) ; X-ray ; artificial palate to chart tongue-position . Here we are enabled to deal either with sound directly or with minute analysis of the vibrations causing specific sounds . Writing and print are , in this case , a necessary evil . Vowels are classed according to the position of the tongue and lips when they are pronounced . Consonants are classed according to the position of the tongue , lips , and other organs involved ( i. e. , teeth , gums , palate . . . ) In English , the vowels are a , e , i , o , u . There are semi-vowels ( that is , sounds partaking of vocalic and consonantal character ) ; these are y , w , 1 and the rolled r . If you listen closely to your vowels , and are conscious of your mouth movements , you will observe that beginning with a , and with the mouth wide open , your mouth gradually closes as you progress through e , i , o and u . For this reason , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of different  | a-sounds ) are called open ; i and u are called close ; the various shades of vowels between them are called half-open or halfclose . The half-open are those nearer to a ( as in ah ) ; the halfclose are those nearer to i ( as in machine ) and u . Vowel sounds are further classified into monophthongs , diphthongs and even triphthongs . The phthong element in these words is from Greek phthoggos , sound ' or voice . ' Monos is Greek for alone , ' i. e. , one ' ; di ( dis ) means twice ' ; tri relates to three . ' A monophthong , then , is a vowel of single , simple sound . A diphthong has two sounds , and a triphthong , three . Thus , our y , in my , though written as a single letter , is really composed of the elements ah and ee . It is a diphthong . The of in boil , the a in mate , are diphthongs . The is in liar is a triphthong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a weak a in succession . A in dale is a diphthong ; ai in wait likewise . Miau contains the triphthong iau . It is the sound , not the spelling , that decides . If you will focus your attention now upon the part of the mouth where the vowels are formed , rather than upon the relative width of the opening , you will observe that some vowels are made at the front of the mouth , some in the middle , and others at the back . Generally speaking , a , e and i are front vowels ; o and u are back . Certain types of i and e are central . This description , of course , is greatly simplified , but it emphasizes the important considerations that vowels are classified according to the width of the mouth opening ( position of the lips ) and the part of the mouth in which they originate ( or , another way of describing the process , the position of the tongue ) . An exceedingly simplified diagram ? the so-called vowel triangle , might represent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consonants are described and classified according to a more complicated system , because more organs are involved in sounding them . The names , however , once they are understood , are essentially simple . Consonants are voiced or unvoiced . That is , they are made with or without the vibration of the vocal membranes . P , t , and k ( which in this case stands also for hard c and q ) are unvoiced . As you pronounce them , place your fingers lightly upon your Adam 's apple , and you will feel no vibrations . B , d , g are voiced ; your fingers , under the conditions of the little experiment just suggested , will feel vibration . Such sounds as p , b , t , d , k , g , are known as stops or occlusives . Occlusive is from Latin occludere , meaning to close ' or shut , ' or ' to stop . ' ( A stopper closes a bottle ; to pronounce a stop or occlusive one must close or stop the mouth . ) Occlusives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voiced or unvoiced . Still another name for this group is explosives , or plosives , because of the airpuffs emitted during their utterance . The opposite of the explosion , in the phonetic sense , is implosion ; there are a few sounds that we make by drawing the breath inward rather than expelling it : the familiar ts ts to express sympathy or commiseration , the indrawn to express pain , the oh ! of unbelieving horror or indignation . Language , however , is predominantly a matter of outbreathing ; this is more comfortable , more transmissive . There are various terms also for voiced and unvoiced in this connection . Voiceless , unvoiced and surd are used to describe the same phonetic process . Another word for voiced is sonant . Surd is from the Latin for silent ' or deaf ' : surdis . It refers to lack of voice or lack of reason . In mathematics a surd is a quantity that can not be expressed by " rational " numbers . Absurdity is contrariness to reason , and probably referred at first to inharmoniousness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ means sounding ' ( Latin sonare ) . There are other consonants , however , than voiced or voiceless stops ; there are the so-called fricatives or spirants . Fricative is from Latin fricare , to rub ' ; it is akin to the word  | friction . Spirant is from Latin spirare , to breathe ' or blow . ' A spirant or fricative is a consonant that , unlike either the voiced or voiceless ones we have considered , may continue in utterance : f , s , th . Once you have pronounced a p , t , or k ( voiceless ) you are , so to speak , through with it ; the same holds true for the voiced consonants ( b , d , g ) . An f , s , or th , however , you can continue to pronounce as long as your breath holds out . This quality the spirants share with the vowels ; for this reason , another name for fricatives and spirants is continuants . The affricate ( Latin afiricatus , past participle of affricare , ' to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a spirant . It is not uncommon in English . It may be heard as an explanation of scorn : Pf ! , or in the borrowed Pfui ! , or in such combinations as cupful . German , in the phonemes pf and z ( pronounced ts ) , has characteristic affricates : Pfund , pound ' ; zehn , ten . ' An aspirate ( Latin aspirates , breathed ' ) is a sound that blends with , is preceded by , or followed by , an h sound . The Greek sound that is named phi and pronounced f is often transliterated as ph ; that is why we have two spellings for such words as fantasy or phantasy ( Greek phaineien , ' to show ' ; a phantom is an apparition , a thing that appears ) . Originally , the p and the h of the ph were sounded separately ; they achieved their f sound by phonetic evolution . Our wh in where and when and white is an aspirated w which is losing the aspiration , now being frequently pronounced as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the part of the mouth in which they occur and the other for the relative width of the mouth in making them , so consonants have two descriptions : one for the nature of the sound or soundlessness , the other for the organs involved . Consonants are made , variously , by the teeth , the gums , the hard and the soft palate , the uvula , the lips . A consonant made by both lips is called bi-labial because bi is Latin for two ' and labium is Latin for lip . ' A consonant made by the lip and teeth is called labio- dental because the Latin for ' tooth ' is dens , dentis ; labium we already know . A consonant is called palato-alveolar because it is made by the palate and the gums . ( Latin palatum , ' roof of the mouth , ' and alveolus , " a small hollow ' ; this term is applied , among other things , to the teeth sockets , or the gum-ridge . ) A consonant is said to be palatalized when it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ y element . In Spanish senor , the n is palatalized ; the sound of this n , in Spanish , is represented by the tilde , or curve over the letter n ; in Portuguese the palatalization is indicated by an h after the n : nh , as in senhor ; in Italian the same palatalization is indicated by gn : signor . The palatalized 1 is indicated in Spanish by ii : Guillermo ; in Italian by gli : Guglielmo ; in Portuguese by lh : Guilherme . Velar consonants are so called from Latin velum , ' the soft palate . ' Velum originally meant an ' awning ' or a ' veil ' ; its application to the soft palate is a metaphor . The difference between the palatum , or ' hard palate , ' and the velum may be felt with your finger , if you will run it along the roof of your mouth from front to rear . The velum is the further from the teeth . Guttural is another word for velar ( Latin guttur , ' throat ' ) , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat . Velar , or even back ( adjective ) , is preferable because it is more scientific . The term cacuminal is met . ( Latin , cacumen , cacuminis , ' top . ' ) It refers to consonants made with the tip or point of the tongue turned up and back . Another name for this is cerebral , from the notion that these were head sounds . Cerebral , however , is as unscientific as guttural . There are no head tones nor chest tones , for that matter . All voice passes through the glottis ? the vocal cords . L and r are classed as liquids , because they are vowel-like in their smoothness , their flowing nature . L is also called a lateral or side sound ( Latin , latus , lateris , ' side ' ) because the breath is emitted on both sides of the tongue when it is sounded , or at least on one side .  | Some classifications include m and n among the liquids ; the more usual grouping for these letters is as nasals , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are characterized by resonance in the nose . The classifications of vowels and consonants that have been given in the preceding paragraphs are suggestive only ; they represent but partially the complicated system that phoneticians have devised for classifying the sounds made by human beings in their respective languages . A single sound , vowel or consonant , may be regarded from so many different points of view ? or , ought I say , points of hearing ? that to classify it fully means the employment of many technical terms . Any large dictionary contains a complete description of the sounds in language , grouping them as to the way in which they are produced , the organs cooperating in producing them , the position of the organs on the one hand and the action of the organs on the other , and so on into as many refinements as the ear and the instruments of phonetic research can detect . My own feeling is that this , for the layman , is perhaps the last of the linguistic branches to consider with any degree of thoroughness . More important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sounds may change ? that they may shift from one class to another ? not by any magical process , but by a simple shift in the precise adjustment of the organs involved . In other words , shifts of sounds originate as shifts in mental and physical adjustment . We have been dealing mainly with English sounds . The sounds that characterize a particular language are referred to , collectively , as the phonetic system of that particular language . Naturally , tables of vowels and consonants vary considerably for each tongue ? far more , indeed , than one would imagine from looking at printed diagrams . The French a is not the English a ; the French d is not the English d , nor is the German d either of the other d 's . Each language has its own subtle way of producing its sounds ? its own phonetic system . We hear this well enough when we listen to a for- eigner speaking his own tongue or attempting to speak ours . A knowledge of phonetics , by describing sounds to us in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , helps us to appreciate more keenly the differences between one phonetic system and another . The more skilful adjustment of our speech organs enables us to imitate better the sounds in one system that are foreign to our own . Why do different peoples speak different tongues ? Why do they have different phonetic systems ? At first sight , or hearing , these questions would not seem to be related at all . The first of the questions we may leave for the nonce . The second is closer to our interests of the moment . For , if we attend sharply to the pronunciation of our own tongue , we discover that even inside of its boundaries there are many different pronunciations of the vowels and consonants . It is impossible to say , this is English , and its sounds are pronounced thus and so ; this is German , and its sounds are pronounced thus and so . The vowels and consonants of American English are not those of London , though the languages are essentially both English . The phonetic system of Parisian French is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Canada , although each language is essentially French . Different vocalic and consonantal versions of one 's own tongue may be heard without walking out of one 's own residential district . Pronunciation , like language , and like truth in the proverb , changes in the mouths of honest men . Why is this so ? Perhaps the differences that begin in our own environment , without rendering our language unintelligible to us as we speak with our neighbors , are but a sample , on a much smaller scale and over a much smaller period , of the differences that finally result in distinct languages . Many an American audience , when first confronted by a group of actors from London , or by a lecturer from Scotland , has had an uncomfortable quarter of an hour adjusting  | its ear to a definite shift in the phonetic system of what , presumably , was the same language . No doubt the Londoners , sitting before a group of American players , find a similar difficulty of adjustment , both as to vocabulary and phonetic system . As to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there have been a number of explanations . We need not go too deeply into them ; first , because they are somewhat hazy , and again , because we are more interested in the fact that they do exist . Certain very important deductions are possible from the differences and how they are related to one another historically and psychologically . In other words , we know that the differences exist ; we have a notion as to how they have evolved . But whether one type of people is supposed to prefer this kind of vowel or consonant , and another type a different set , is not so sure . For example , climate and environment have been named as the determining factors . Islanders , according to one theory , are supposed to prefer dentals , while mountain inhabitants prefer harsh throat-sounds . But how about mountaineers who live on islands ? For there are mountainous islands . . . . Another theory suggests that the mixture of races results in phonetic alteration . A third seeks their source in the change of the speech-organs . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cerebrum ? i.e. , ultimately in psychological adjustments . As with theories concerning the origin of language itself , we approach closer to the truth , perhaps , by a fusion of the various opinions . Certainly climate and environment , which affect other human traits so markedly , must have an influence upon enunciation , upon style and speed of delivery , upon the conditions in which linguistic exchange takes place . Whether it can be proved that islanders actually favor sounds created in the forward part of the mouth , and mountaineers favor sounds created near the throat , is another matter . Certainly , too , racial mixture must result in types of phonetic change ; precisely what the nature of the change may  | be , is again another matter . Racial mixture accounts ? though not alone ? for changes in physical structure and in mental outlook ; how then can it help determining , if only subtly , certain phonetic changes ? Surely , whatever it is that changes organs of the body is bound to have its effect upon what those organs do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; besides , no organ acts of itself , without relation to the rest of the organism . The tendency , of late , has been to assign all changes basically to the mind ? to alterations in the structure of the cerebrum . Criticizing the theory that linguistic change is caused by changes in the organs of speech , Pedersen wittily remarks that " this is quite as absurd as to explain the evolution of the dance as due to changes in the leg muscles . Sound changes . . . are of psychological origin . . . . " 3 To this some might reply that it is a difficult matter to draw a hard and fast line between psychology and physiology . There must be a body for the mind to work upon , and a mind to work upon the body . For the present we must be content with this : there is , there has always been , and there always will be , linguistic change . Ultimately such change , beginning at a specific moment in the history of a language , and with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may lead to the evolution of a language that could not be understood by the speakers of the tongue from which the new language evolved . Such change goes on constantly , not only in the sounds of speech but in the meanings of words , in the functions of grammatical forms , in the number of words . Meanings change ; grammar changes ; the vocabulary changes ; the sounds of the language change . All is change ; nothing in language stands still , until a particular language is no longer spoken . Then it is what we call " dead . " Classical Latin , classical  | Greek , classical Sanskrit , are dead languages . They exist now only in records . They no longer change in sound , vocabulary , grammar , or meaning , because they are no longer in the mouths of living people , used for the purposes of living . There is a true sense , however , in which Latin and Greek and Sanskrit ( and other tongues no longer spoken ) never died . They were , in the course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Rumanian , Provencal , Portuguese , and many lesser dialects are the living continuation of the Latin that was spoken by the common people . If we had no written or engraved records to preserve the tongues from which modern languages are descended , we should not know what a " dead " language was . These records fix the state of a language at a certain epoch in the past , and enable us to compare the old language with the newer tongues that may be traced back to it . Language is always dying ; it is always being reborn . A specific language may " die " ; that is , it may cease to be spoken in a certain definite system of speech-sounds , word-meanings , grammatical forms , and vocabulary . It lives on , however , in the system that has grown out of it . People have never ceased talking it . There comes a time when so many changes have occurred that there is a distinct difference between the old tongue and the newly evolved one . While the essential changes were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being shaped from the old . Such changes are too gradual ; we notice only a symptom here and there . Another way of stating the general proposition is this : Languages die ; language is immortal . If we watch closely the forces that make for change in our own daily speech , we shall obtain a better conception of the changes that lead , ultimately , to the formation of different tongues out of a single parent-tongue . Latin , as we have seen , broke up finally into a number of languages that are not understood reciprocally : the Frenchman does not , without study , understand the Spaniard or the Rumanian ; neither  | do these others understand the Frenchman or each other . English , Dutch , German , Danish and Swedish have , in the dim past , a common ancestor , yet they are independent languages to-day , requiring , if one member is to understand another , special study . Evidences of the relationship abound ; they have evolved too far from one another , however , to remain mutually comprehensible . Since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jointed , distinctly spoken ) they have accented and unaccented parts . Accent , or stress , is in fact a feature of the articulation . Gesture is accented on the first syllable ; gesticuldtion is accented on the fourth ; gesticulative is accented on the second . Return a moment to gestic'ula " tion . Long words have primary and secondary accents . The chief accent of this word is , as we have said , on the fourth syllable ; but there is a lesser accent on the syllable tic . Words , too , like Aristotelian plots , have beginnings , middles , and ends . That is , the vowels and consonants that comprise them have initial , medial , and final position . Accent and position are very important in the history of sound changes . Unaccented syllables , unless there are counteractive influences , tend to weaken or disappear . Accented syllables tend to remain , sometimes undergoing alteration . Final syllables tend , unless accented , to be pronounced weakly and sometimes to vanish even before they have disappeared from spelling . Thus the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( rose ) , puerum ( boy ) had already weakened in classical speech . Since most nouns in Romance languages come from the accusative cases of the people 's Latin , this m does not appear in French rose , Spanish rosa . As for accents , they undergo shifts , even as sounds do . Take such a word as the hitherto unfamiliar quintuplets . The people at once pronounced the word quintuplets , with the accent on the u instead of on the i ; for most , the Dionne sisters will remain quintuplets . The word is somewhat unwieldy , not because it has many syllables : they are only  | three , though it sounds and looks as if there were more . It is manifestly foreign ; the nt and the pl cause a slight hesitation because they threaten to jumble the consonants , especially with the final is in sight . ( Try saying the word rapidly , and see what happens . ) It suggests triplets , where the accent is on the second-last syllable . If it suggests quadruplets , it suggests @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of on the a . The popular accentuation of quintuplets , then , becomes , by analogy with triplets , and through a certain phonetic convenience , changed from the standard . Such a change often persists . If classical Latin cathedra had n't shifted to cathedra , in popular speech , the modern Portuguese would not have the pronunciation cadeira for their word meaning chair . ' Peculiarly , the original Greek kathedra , which gave the word to Latin , was accented on the e . Such words as Spanish libertad and Italian liberty and French liberte are accented on the final syllable . But the Latin libertdtem accusative of libertas ( liberty ) was accented on the second-last syllable . The ending em , containing the weak final m of which we spoke above , considering such words as rosam and puerum , disappeared ; the accent , however , remained where it had always been . There are technical names for words having accented last , second-last , and third-last syllables . The word with accented final syllable is called the oxytone ( Greek Oxus , sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appears in oxygen ; that is , sharp or acid matter ; the gen element is related to the root of gignesthai , ' to be born , ' and is found in eugenics ? good birth . ' The word with accent on the syllable before the last is called paroxytone . ( Greek pard , alongside of . ) The word with the accent on the second syllable from the last is called a proparoxytone . ( Greek pro , before , ' in front of . ' ) Finally , the syllables themselves are named from their position : the ultima is the last ( Latin ultimus , last ' ; an ultimatum is a final warning ) . The second-last is the penultirna ,
