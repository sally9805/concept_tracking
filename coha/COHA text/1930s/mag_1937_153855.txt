Last week the Department announced that from May 1 to September 30 such agencies raised $548,765 in the U. S. , spent $173,584 on administration and publicity , set aside reserves of $117,627 and sent to Spain for relief $301,001 . <P> Nearly two-thirds of the relief actually sent to Spain was transmitted by the North American Committee to Aid Spanish Democracy , frankly Leftist in sympathy , which sent $197,575 .

Ambassador to Spain Ogden Haggerty Hammond , and from which Major General William Nafew Haskell withdrew saying it was not non-partisan but Rightist in his opinion , not only has sent no relief to Spain but spent $30,241 on publicity and administration while taking in only $28,635 . This was attributed by Mr. Hammond chiefly to losses incurred with a Madison Square Garden pageant on May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Brooklyn Tablet .
