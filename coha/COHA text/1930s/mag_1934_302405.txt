The world 's yellow races are breeding five or six times faster than the white races . <P> Of white peoples the Europeans increase most slowly and the most civilized European countries the slowest of all . Fertility champions of Europe are the Jugoslavs with a 35 net increase per 1,000 population per year . Tail-enders are the Swedes with a net increase of 15 per 1,000 . <P> Of the 195,000,000 souls by which world population will grow in the next ten years , Asia will contribute 140,000,000 , the Americas 35,000,000 , Europe 20,000,000 , others little or nothing . <P> Such were the figures published last week in Paris by Professor Charles Richet , president of the French Academy of Sciences . Completing his survey of population growth , Professor Richet found Shanghai leading the world 's great cities with an annual increase rate of 55 per 1,000 . Tokyo and Osaka next with 44 and 33 . New York 's rate is only 19 , but with a long headstart that city remains at the top of Professor Richet 's metropolitan picture for 1944 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Tokyo 1944 : 7,100,000 1934 : 4,970,000 <P> Shanghai 1944 : 5,700,000 1934 : 3,259,000 <P> Berlin 1944 : 4,600,000 1934 : 4,236,000 <P> Moscow 1944 : 4,500,000 1934 : 3,368,000 <P> London 1944 : 4,400,000 1934 : 4,396,000 <P> Chicago 1944 : 4,300,000 1934 : 3,376,000 <P> Osaka 1944 : 3,800,000 1934 : 2,450,000 <P> Leningrad 1944 : 2,900,000 1934 : 2,795,000 <P> Paris 1944 : 2,900,000 1934 : 2,891,000 <P> Buenos Aires 1944 : 2,700,000 1934 : 2,195,000 <P> Because revolutions , cataclysms , famines or epidemics may alter present tendencies , Professor Richet refused to look farther than 1944 . But if present rates continue , Tokyo with 10,536,000 residents 20 years hence will have nosed past New York .
