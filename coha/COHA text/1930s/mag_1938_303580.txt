ARMY &; NAVY <P> One of the last fights fought by the late Royal S. Copeland was for adequate antiaircraft equipment for the army . As Senator from New York , he could well visualize what might happen to the topless towers of Manhattan if enemy bombers ever laid eggs among them . Inland Senators were apathetic , but other coast Senators agreed . He knew that the nine antiaircraft regiments of the regular army have only seven or eight guns apiece ( twelve is par ) , that few of the ten antiaircraft regiments of the National Guard have anything more effective than machine guns . Largely due to Senator Copeland , $13,000,000 went into the army 's 1938 appropriation specifically earmarked for antiaircraft , and the army was authorized to contract for $10,000,000 more in antiaircraft ordnance , for later delivery . Last week the army placed its orders : for 333 weapons and ammunition , range finders , searchlights and other accessories to match . Most of the guns will be made piecemeal by private factories , assembled in army arsenals . The guns , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of modern times , the great French 75 , will be able to fire 50 or 60 shots per minute , to a vertical range of 30,000 ft. , will be highly mobile , mounted on bogies ( two-wheeled trailers ) .
