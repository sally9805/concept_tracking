MAJOR ALSHUSTER A STORY BY KAY BOYLE E ANYONE thinks I saw him only that I once , the time he showed me his mother 's house in June , that is n't true ; for the truth is every time I go out , if I go up the country in the rain or walk on the chalk edge in the evening and watch the swans below  --  only the two of them , moving down the river 's mouth to the edge of salt where the low waves run into the dark fresh water ? I meet Major Alshuster coming through the drenching grass or along the cliff , and he puts out his hand at once and says , " I 'm sorry I did n't let you have my mother 's Dower House . " He looks just as he did in June : he is a young man still , he is not quite forty , and if he is on horseback when I meet him he gets down from his horse and we walk along together , with the gulls overhead crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ evening light . His head is narrow , unlike a military head , and his hair is black like a Spanish girl 's ; his shoulders are broad and his waist thin , and he has a handsome , vain , a slightly bewildered face , and a loud , unhappy laugh . But there is one thing that has altered in him since the first time we met : it is his eyes that have altered and he looks at me with courage as if there were nothing of India left to mar his sight . The first time I heard of him was in June when they told me in the hotel bar , " If you 're looking for a house , there 's a man up at Needlehay with ahouse to let , " and they said to ask for Major Alshuster where he lived at the Manor House with his mother and sister . " His sister , you see , " said the Scotch woman who served behind the hotel bar , " his sister , she never married so as to keep house-like for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nor had Major Alshuster ever married , said the Scotch woman who was still unused to the English . " I do n't know why he never married , " she said , and she looked quickly round the hotel bar to see how near to the sound of her voice the people were sitting . " Unless it 's because every demned one of the English has a heart like that , " she said , and she rapped the wood of the counter . She opened her newspaper out fiat on the bar between us and she said , " I put five pounds up every time there 's a Scotch hearse running , " and a grim smile of love came on her mouth as if there were more kin between herself and any Scotch horse than with the English . " One running to-morrow name of Bonnie Dundee , " she said with the sports ' page spread out . " You can put your faith on a Scotch hearse every time . " There was a paper written about the place at Needlehay , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the house to let . It had boot and knife houses , a tile-floored dairy , and " practically every window , " said MAJOR ALSHUSTER the paper they gave me to read , " was stone-dressed and many had stone mullions with tracery above filling the pointed arched headings . The drainage had recently received attention ; the soil was light top soil , gravel and sand subsoil . " There was a building on the grounds , it said , " erected in keeping with the House , with a livery room and a fireplace , a cobbled wash , and three rooms for the chauffeur . Hidden from the drive by yew hedges , was a heated span Greenhouse , a peach case , a range of pits , and an open barrow shed . The trees not only include forest trees , " said this paper that was signed by Major Alshuster 's name , " but ornamental ones as well . Splashes of color are provided by the variety of flowering shrubs planted in clumps about the grounds . There is an undulating lawn shaded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mown and rough grass with bulb carpets , a rose garden , strawberry and asparagus beds . " There was a photograph of the Dower House standing quiet , looking out to sea , and of this the paper said " there are ribbed stone quoins , mullions , tracery to windows , tappings to gabled ends and parapet walls , carved masks to springing of archings , and parts of its elevation clad in a variety of choice flowering and evergreen creepers . " " If I had any money at all , " I said to the picture at the bar , " this is a place I 'd grow old in and die in its arms , " and on Friday I went in curiosity up to Needlehay in the rain and heat , and I met Major Alshuster at the gate of the Dower House , where he said on the telephone he would be , He was touching his short , black mustaches with his dark , burned hand , and he could scarcely see me getting out of the car for the hand of blindness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was wearing breeches and puttees , and his horse was standing at the gate with its bridle drawn through the iron ring . " We do n't really want , " was the first thing he said , " that is to say , we never let anyone have the house before . We 're not at all keen on having . . " he said , and he looked away over the fields where the men were scything down the hay . A mile or so off the gray wing-tip of the Manor House could be seen , showing above the trees . " My mother , " said Major Alshuster as we went through the gate , and he winced at the sound of the intimate word as if in saying it he had given too much of his own life away , " she 's rather the worse for wear at present , so it 's up to me . " He put the key in the lock of the Dower House , and I saw very close to me the coarsening , thickening side of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might have been clear-skinned wonder in youth to this texture of caution and despair . The color came up into his neck with fear , and he was as delicately made as a girl , with his black hair nipped close at his ears , and his cheekbones standing high . But here was the thicken . ing , toughening side of his face saying " huntin ' , shootin ' , fishin ' " and nothing else besides . This was the first time we met and he did not speak of other things to me . He did not tell me the names of the different grasses growing thick in the fields , although he knew them very well . He did not say that for a horse 's mouth hay should he a year old , smell sweet but not be mowburnt ; but instead , he went quickly through the reception rooms and through the servants ' hall and the kitchen , escaping , as though pursued by the person who had come to see . " This is the study sort of thing , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mount the stairs . He was always ahead , with his back turned on this woman or any other . They were none of them going to get the house as long as he was there . " This is a bedroom and so 's that , " he said , hastening past the doorways . He wanted the place standing empty in its grounds alone , with its Italian garden and its grass tennis court leading almost to the edge of chalk , and below it the sea sucking in and out with a hollow sigh as it left the shore . He did not want strangers asleep in its beds or sitting at ease by its fireplaces . He wanted it empty of life , chambered and clean as an empty nut , with the key of the door in the palm of his own hand to set in the lock when he liked . He did not want strange people in it , speaking what must be a foreign language there . Give him an army man , or his wife , and he knew at once , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an army not the British . But give him British army people and he could tell you at a glance , before they opened their mouths even . But the thing was that his mother was ill ; he had said so as he went through the gate , and now he could use the money that the Dower House might bring . He had made up his mind to let it  --  to let it furnished with all the old things in it , and if he could not decide for himself , then he looked to the fine , old things , to the chests and the solid tables and the strong beds , to speak out , to cry aloud if he had opened the door to people he was going to regret for the rest of his life . He did not speak of horses that day , he did not say that " spirit and ardor are in the temper of a horse what passion is in the mind of man , " but on other days he talked of the horse that was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this horse was bold and generous , quick and active . " He 's bold as brass over rough , blind country , " Major Alshuster said to me as we walked along one night . " Hehas plenty of heart room , and he 's a good doer . " We stopped to listen to the sea below us murmuring in and out , and Major Alshuster spoke suddenly out of the darkness . " Did you ever do any pig-sticking , Mrs. Whatchername ? " he said . But on this day he hastened past the third lavatory door of the Dower House , and then he reached back and opened it in confusion , and closed it quickly again . " That 's just another thingamabob , a thingamajig , " he said in a low voice as he escaped to the second fluor . " You saw the one like it just below . " Mrs. Whatchername came breathless to the landing . " A what ? " she said , looking straight at him up the stairs . She opened the door quite wide and stared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of shame ran up the Major 's neck and ended in his hair . " Daresay your husband 's not an army man ? " said Major Alshuster uneasily in the nursery , and Mrs. Whatchername said : " I have n't any husband . I 'm quite alone . Except , of course , for my children . " " Oh , yes , " said Major Alshuster , staring at the wan . He saw Mrs. Whatchername counting out the beds , and he touched his black mustache in fear . " Where , " he said , clearing his throat , " where would the children be going to school ? " His eyes moved swiftly out the window in escape . She might say the wrong school ; in spite of the strength and wisdom of his race he must wait with the meekness of a beast for the words to be said so that he should know . " School ? " said Mrs. Whatchername , catching sight of herself with pleasure in the glass . " Oh , yes , school . I 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ house I like . " Some thought took hold of the Major 's mouth and twisted it aside . " Oh , I daresay , " he said , and he shut his teeth on his contempt . " Of course , " he said presently , clearing his throat , " here in England we 'd go about it the other way . Cart before the horse sort of thing , I daresay , " he said in mock humility . " In my country , " said Mrs. Whatchername smiling at the Major , " horses know their place . They would n't dream of getting behind a cart . " That was in June , and there were a hundred sheep in the heat on the other side of the garden wall asking for peace of mind all afternoon . We went down the staircase to the hall , and we could hear the hard , high rattle shaking in their mouths , the question shaking unanswered on their pallid tongues . Major Alshuster 's lovely delicate shadow ran down the massive stone of the stairs , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hall below . " What do they want ? " I said . " What are they asking you for ? " But whether they wanted water or care , or a direction in which to follow , Major Alshuster could not be brought to say . He stood near the gate where his horse was moving from the flies , and he held the answer in his mouth . " I daresay my farmer knows what 's up , " he said , and he did not listen to the sound of the sheep asking for what he did not have to give . He saw a rabbit hurrying down the land and it was of that he began speaking . " The rabbits ruin the country , " he said with bitterness as the little white puff of tail went under the hedge at the end , " The rabbits ! " said Mrs. Whatchername looking brightly at him . " Not the dole then ? " " No , not at all , " said the Major shortly . " 1 daresay you 'd scarcely have anyone with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Mrs. Whatchername firmly , " I do n't believe in guns . I would n't let my children have them . I do n't believe in war . " " Oh , " said the Major , clearing his throat . " Of course , whatchacall it , civilization sort of thing , naturally we 're all out to avoid it if we can . " " Have you managed , " said Mrs. Whatchername , " to avoid war ? " " That 's neither here nor there , " said the Major with sudden briskness , stepping ahead as if to speed her on her way . " We 'd need someone here to keep the rabbits in order . Of course , if you could n't keep the rabbits down , there 'd scarcely be any use . . . " " But I want this house , " said Mrs. Whatchername behind him . Out of curiosity she had come this far , out of curiosity saying the things she said . She felt the stones of the gravel through her shoes as she walked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this was the house she wanted . There was no money for the wax on its floors , for keeping the grass-court rolled or the dovecots clean ; there were no pigskin bags to be carried in the door . But her voice went up the Major 's back and round his neck like a woman 's arm . " This is the only house I 've ever wanted , " she said . The gulls were flying inland over the house and garden , their voices crying , their salt-white breasts firm on the wind . The clouds were breaking now , and shaped clear against them , the gulls mewed their sour word over the full-headed trees and the beds of marigold and straight , strong sweet william . For a little while nothing remained of England , with these wild , white birds of the sea crying hunger , hunger , hunger to a land as green as moss . " I 'd just like to see the greenhouse , " said Mrs. Whatchername , and the Major cleared his throat and went over the little step at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once within the greenhouse there arose a languorous , a stifling tide of heat that clasped their limbs in a mute , lingering embrace , and folded close upon their throats ; the smell of geranium stopped their nostrils with crimson corks , and the heart cried out in vain for breath . The sun burned strong and white and pitiless on the glass panes above their heads  --  this sun , coming suddenly after rain , is the fiercest , having waited and gathered vengeance into its pale , swooning light  --  and through this fecund , slowly expanding world they moved , Mrs. Whatchername behind the Major , pressing deeper and deeper into the tropic , suffocating belt of rich , unfolding life . Here in this heart of glass were cactus besought to grow , wooed from the dark earth and rotting wood until they stood , leather-thick and coarse , with their soft yellow or long , silvery beards upon their bellies , rearing upward like snakes poised to strike . But only in one had the promise been fulfilled , and the bright cactus flower had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ginger plants in bloom , and mingling with the others on the air the smell of these frail , spidery , yellow , ginger-flowers ; and on the other , ferns uncurling in yards of narrow , deep green lace , the prongs of fern opening finger by finger from the dark , skeleton hand . " Here , " the glass above their heads was wooing them , " is Spain , Italy , sweet-mouthed islands ; nothing to do with pale ale tepid in the glass , with the Cathedral Close , with Cookery Nooks , or lobster teas upon a stony shore that does not hesitate to cast the first . " Deeper and deeper into the jungle heat of the greenhouse they went , and here were the tomato plants lifting their lean , burdened arms , and here the onions in basket-trays drying in their burnished skins , and their blood ran slow as honey in their veins . " England is outside , " said Mrs. Whatchername , scarcely speaking in the Italian heat , and the Major turned swiftly round , and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The gardener 's broken mirror was hanging to an upright beam , and Mrs. Whatchername walked straight to Major Alshuster , close enough to touch him with her hand , and looked into the glass . She saw the blue hat on her head , and the pieces of smooth , light hair drawn back , and the short , white nose , and the red put on her mouth , and she said : " Do n't look at me , please . It 's not fair to look at any woman over thirty in the sun . " " I am looking at you , " said the Major savagely behind her . " I 've been looking at you for an hour . I do n't want to stop looking at you , " he said . " I do n't want to stop at all . " " Please , " said Mrs. Whatchername lazily into the glass , " look at something else while I fix my lips . And besides , I 'm not here . Not a single bit of me is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sun . " But when Mrs. Whatchername turned round there was nothing left of what the Major had said . He was looking straight at the tomato plants , and it might very well have been someone else who had spoken , for the fire was extinguished in his eyes . He had turned a little from her , and there was nothing left ; there was only the trembling of his hand as he put back his Spanish hair . " Do you think , " said Mrs. Whatchername , " that if devastation came to this place , this island , England , I mean , do you think in the fury of the burning and the flood and the chaos there would be one person , just one person drunk and dancing , making music of some kind to die by ? " " The what ? " said Major Alshuster in a loud , startled voice and he stepped back before her . " I think , " said Mrs. Whatchername , " there would be people standing still all over the country , standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . " The crying of the sheep had grown so strong now that when she stepped out of the greenhouse it was as if a hundred fleshless hands were rattling in desperate supplication before her on the air . They were asking her this , the bare knuckles of their anguish asking it of her , and she had no answer to give them but could only turn her back on the ague of their speech and make as if she had not heard them . The Major 's tethered horse turned his head to look at her as she got into the small old car . If anyone thinks it was because I never saw Major Alshuster again that I remember every word we said , it is not true . For even after the letter he wrote me , even after the matter of letting the house or not letting it was finished with , still that was not the end of it . The day after I visited the Dower House , I had the letter from Major Alshuster . He wrote me : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fear I shall have to forego the pleasure of renting you my mother 's Dower House . Thank you for your inquiry . Yours very truly . " I did not see him at once , but I went up to the Half-Way House one wet afternoon in late July , and I was at peace in my heart for all the colors that came alive as soon as the sun was out of sight , for the fresh little furze flowers , and the red sumac beads , and the power of the thick short grass . That afternoon I met him on the downs and he was on horseback , and when he sprang off , the saddle leather and the leather of his gaiters creaked aloud as sweet as small birds speaking in the bush . He walked along beside me , looking at the ground before his feet , and the reins of his horse were through his fingers and his horse was following docilely behind . He said , " The way it happened was that everything came at once this year : too much rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I knew the hay should be cut was the time they should have been shearing the sheep , and not enough hands for it . A late crop , " said Major Alshuster , " loses half its value because the seeds fall out . We got the wool off the sheep that night  --  they were asking for it the day you looked at the house . " He was saying these things at once to me as if making up for the things he had not said . " We 'd had them closed in a day and a half , thinking we 'd make the time . But we did it by lantern-light , and the cattle went unmilked until half-past three in the morning . They looked as if they 'd been struck with the rickets , the lot of them by then , with their hind legs falling away from under because of the weight of their milk . " The hills lying beyond us and beyond Sidmouth were as blue as pansies , and the heather sprang up fresh and rosy at our feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many things . It was as if he had waited a long time , as if he had waited his life to say them . He talked of his horses , and of this horse that was following now as soft as music over the sod behind us . He was a pig-sticker , he said , with the strong loins and thighs and hocks of a pig-sticker , the hard , sound legs and the good sloping pasterns , and the heart room to spare that a good doer and a good pig-sticker should have . " A man can see a lot of fun fox hunting , " said the Major and , without any warning given or heard , Mrs. Whatchername saw that the Major was beautiful . He was a wonderful thing , with his neck fitting well into his shoulders , and his face lifted to the open embrace of rain . His throat was strong and bare from his coat , and from the sides of it the ears sprang up and lay flat and close to his narrow , perfect skull . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " the Major said , " a man can see a lot of fun . But that is n't true for pig-sticking . If your horse is n't bold and free over rough , blind going , and is too cunning and careful to take you within spearing distance of the pig , then there 's no use wasting time on him . He may be a savage in the stable , " said the Major  --  and the line of his teeth was white as a tusk under his ruddy lip and his black mustache ? " but if he 'll gallop over hairy , blind country and go blindly up to an angry boar and face a charge , then you can forgive him for anything else . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Whatchername , scarcely breathing . " Yes . " She saw how small and strong were the Major 's wrists , and how the lip of his leather glove , turned back , showed the skin burned dark on his hands . " It 's the boar , " said the Major , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass , " that chooses the ground , and that 's the devil of it . When he 's hunted he 'll take good care to select a line where the going 's as rough and the covert as thick as he can find . " " Yes , " said Mrs. Whatchername , " yes . " her words were soft in her mouth , almost without breath , so the Major could scarcely have heard . She was walking beside him in the rain , walking with the sight gone from her eyes , walking with the knowledge in her limbs that the Major was shaped in strong , pure movement beside her , walking in step with him , toward whatever he was going to . " Toward what are we going ? " she said , scarcely aloud , and the Major said : " When he finds he 's being over-hauled he 'll still have lots up his sleeve , the bastard will . He 'll suddenly jink sharp right or left , quick as a hare from a greyhound . " " Yes , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kill your pig with one spear , " said the Major . " Only you must never thrust at him , and that 's always the thing you want to do . You must just drop the point and hold it steady and let the force of the collision do the rest . If you thrust at him you 'll miss him clean , nine times out of ten . Just set your spear and then wait , " said the Major with the wet green bracken slapping at his puttees ; " and if your spear is sharp , " he said , " it will go in like a hot knife into butter . " The rain was falling on the side of his face , down from the brim of his soft brown hat , and falling sad and pale on the land and sea ahead . And suddenly the Major took savagely hold of Mrs. Whatchername 's hand . " The way women go after a man , " he said , speaking quickly , with his fingers biting into her palm , " it 's enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by God , and keeping to it , day after day , for a lifetime , riding him hard , ready for any turn or ruse , into the jungle and out of it , India , home , following him jink by jink until they think they 've got him ! " " They did n't get you , " said Mrs. Whatchername proudly , walking the way he walked to whatever destination he had in mind . " By Gad , they did n't ! " said the Major with a snort of laughter . " Moved right into the country to get me , two of them did . One went as far as Calcutta . And this is what , " he said . " None of them wanted me , d'y'see ? Not a one of the damned bitches . Wanted Needlehay or the name beginning with what it does , or a standing , y ' understand , in South Devon . " " They did n't get it , did they ? " said Mrs. Whatchername softly . She was walking tall and close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ red and her yellow hair pinned back . The Major pulled her roughly against him as they walked . " Look here , " he said . " I like your hair . I like you walking beside me . " The next time I saw him was in a few days , but it was in the evening ; it was quite dark when I went up the red cliff at the end of the town . I had been in the common , leather-benched lounge where the ailing and poor and old came in for their beer , and I had been talking there to an old lady with her grandson beside her and her bonnet tied fast on her head . " He 's only three , " said the old lady taking another glass of beer , " but he can use words as long as your arm . " This was the third we were having together , and her tongue was not quite clear . " Give me somethin ' to drink , com'on now , " snarled the grandson , and the little old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knot of hair . " Just listen to him ! " she gasped with joy , but she gave me a sly look to one side . " Now , swish ! He must have heard somebody asking for a drink one time . " " You give me a drink now , " he said , and he set his nails hard into her arm . I knew I must look the other way while she lifted the glass up quick and put it to his mouth . " He 's as good as good with his granny , " she said when I looked round , " and with his mommy and pop he 's just a terrible boy . They got all kinds of houses and things , " she said with her melting eye , " you never saw . To-day when he was to the beach and see a great big car he went over to turn the crank of it . Only three he is ! He thought as it was his pop 's big ear ! " " My pop ai n't got no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the old lady looked narrowly at him over the brim of her glass . " Just listen to him , will ya ? " she said with her loving smile . " I 'm sure I do n't know where he gets hold of them words as he does . His pop , he 's got the finest car in Devon . " " Give me a drink , " said the little boy , and the old lady reached slyly under the table and pinched his skin . He gave her a kick with his boot , and the old lady lifted her black bag up to hide from the others the sight of him finishing the beer . " He minds me like anything , " she said . " And with his mommy he 's like possessed . " The Scotch lady who served at the hotel bar was passing in the hall , and when she saw me she came in to ask if I 'd found a house . " Did you ever go up to Needlehay that time ? " she said , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Needlehay and looked at the Dower House in June , and now it was August . " It was too large for what I want , " I said , and the Scotch lady said , " What 'll you have this time ? You have a drink with me . " I said I 'd have a gin , and after she had poured it out , she went on speaking to me . " Did you see Major Alshuster ? " she said in a low voice . " Was he still alive when you went there ? " I put down my glass of gin and waited a moment . " Of course he was alive , " I said . I looked right across the bar into her face , and she was shaking her head . " Well , it must have been right after you were there , " she said . " He was killed in June . The end of June . " I knew that there was n't a word of truth in it , but I sat there quiet , listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they were cutting the hay on his place , " she went on , " because the hearse took fright of the mowing machine and reared up , and the Major pulled him over backward . That 's what they told me . The hearse and the Major , the two of them , broke their backs and they were dead in a minute . " I took another gin and then I went out in the dark and along the sea for the length that the walk goes , and up the cliff-path ; and where the land ceased and the water and space began I could not see ; but if I looked to one side the breath came freer , and if I looked to the other it was as if the unseen hand of the land were lifted in silent warning . Major Alshuster was waiting for me where he always waited , leaning on the piece of railing on the perilous edge that in daylight was like a window onto the sea that whispered a mile straight down below . " Listen , Major Alshuster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wooden rail beside him . A beautiful mist , soft as a cat , was moving against my face . " This is the wrong country for me , " I said . " I do n't belong in this country . " I went on talking fast so that I would not cry . " I ca n't bear it , " I said . " I ca n't bear it . I might as well be dead if I have to go on living the way I 'm living . . . . " The Major pulled me suddenly against him and his mouth closed hard and hot upon my mouth . It was dark , and only our breaths and our hands could seek each other out and cling in love together . There were no words left , there was nothing to say , there was only the swooning touch of one taken wildly from the other . " To hell with the country , " said Major Alshuster after a while , and his voice was hoarse , like the voice of a stranger speaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lifted his head to look straight into the darkness which was England stretching invisibly away . " To hell with the country , " he said . We stood close on the edge of it together . " You belong to me , Mrs. Whatchername , " said Major Alshuster . " I do n't believe in death , " he said .
