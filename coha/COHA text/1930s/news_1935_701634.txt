txt The League of Nations Council , after having heard Anthony Eden of Great Britain , Premier Pierre Laval of France and Wolde Mariam of Ethiopia on the Hoare-Laval peace plan , adjourned this evening , ostensibly to await definite replies from the parties before discussing it . Thereafter members of the British delegation conceded unofficially what most other delegations agree on : the plan is now dead . This was their view even before the news of Sir Samuel Hoare 's resignation came to confirm it . Even Mr. Laval , although maintaining an official optimism till Premier Benito Mussolini of Italy has replied , made no effort to push the plan in or outside the Council . He sought only  --  and even this was perhaps making a virtue of a necessity ? to keep the Council from judging the plan today . Eden Indicates Apologies . Mr. Eden , like Mr. Laval , talked in the Council of little more than the expected defeat of the plan . He insisted that Britain did not recommend it and would drop it if any one said an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea that some attempt at conciliation was proper . Both Mr. Eden and Mr. Laval made the most of the necessity for settling the Italo-Ethiopian war by conciliation and they made it clear that this would not be the last attempt in that direction , though they seemed to shift this duty henceforth more to the Couiacil . In the Council , which sat in public session , no one said " no " openly on the plan , or even an indirect word in its favor . No one said a word against it except the Ethiopian delegate , who treated the Italian Army with scorn , denied that Ethiopian warriors " asked or needed any League troops to help them , " and asked only help in getting arms . He said all that one could expect on the subject of asking a victim to reward an aggressor . He laid the foundation for this before the meeting with a scathing , effectively argued declaration from his government holding the plan to be a " complete and flagrant negation " of the League covenant , of the plan of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee of Thirteen in declaring Italy the aggressor . Ethiopia Withholds Reply . The declaration assailed the plan and , by implication , its authors as violating , Article X of the covenant on four counts . It ironically stressed how the plan had been evolved with the participation of the aggressor but not of the victim . In fact , the Ethiopian delegation left little to be said against the plan , but it carefully explained that Ethiopia was not yet replying to it . Before this meeting began Italy made a warning gesture by refusing to attend even the Council meeting in the morning on the Assyrian refugee question , and Mussolini voiced his intransigence in Rome . No one spoke in the Council except Mr. Eden , Mr. Laval and the Ethiopian delegate . The Council adjourned pending definite replies , although - the Ethiopian spokesman had urged it to give its view first . It is doubtful , however , that Ethiopia will insist on this as long as the plan is effectively dropped . Yet despite the Council 's silence the British and other delegates left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that they , expected nobody to make another soon . This was not one of the good days for the theory that Britaip or France , or both together , run the League . Tomorrow morning there will be a secret informal meeting of the Council without the parties concerned " to exchange views on the situation , " though on precisely what basis some members do not know yet . The trend seems to be toward having no public discussion or denunciation of the plan as long as the British and the French virtually abandon it , and to decide that the Council as a body , without the parties concerned in the dispute , will hereafter take charge of all League peace moves . The Council will probably meet to make this ; decision on Friday , though there is a possibility it will convene tomorrow . Committee of 18 to Meet . A meeting of the Committee of Eighteen is announced for Friday , with Sanction 4 ? an embargo on oil , coal , pig iron and steel ? as the only thing the . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not read this so clearly . Mr. Eden has brought with him an oil expert , F. C. Starling , Assistant Secretary of Mines and member of the Board of Trade 's petroleum department . The British are not hiding this light under a bushel . They tell one willingly that Mr , Starling is also their coal and iron expert . One gets from them the impression that the Committee of Eighteen will make some gesture on oil , the minimum being to name committee experts to study the situation and the maximum fixing a date in January for the embargo to begin . The French and a good many others are skeptical of anything serious being done as regards oil , but the French are less positive tonight than they were this morning . British Strategy Fails . The tactics that the Council followed today were a result of a combination of factors . The British Government , there is reason to suspect , wanted the Council , since it was sure to reject the peace plan , to reject it openly today . Then it could tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could also ease its position as regards Mussolini . But some delegations , such as the Spanish , thought this would be making things too easy for the British Government and perhaps too hard on them . They wanted first to know the attitude of the House of Commons and of Mussolini . Other delegations had instructions to tell the Council if the British and the French asked for their opinions on this plan  --  which those two nations were careful not to do today  --  that they believed even discussion of it at the council table would recognize and honor it too much to be safe . Delegations with such instructions are understood to have included the Turkish and the Yugoslay . The Yugoslav delegate , in fact , visited Mr. Eden and Mr. Laval to express the views of the Little and Balkan Ententes . By holding a secret exchange of views tomorrow the small powers will be free to let off steam against the plan in time to influence the House of Commons without , how1 ever , recognizing the scheme or taking a formal position on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
