Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera is about the best in the world . For nearly half a century , however , its financial setup has been nearly as musty as some of its scenery . The Metropolitan Opera Association , which produces the operas , does not own the dirty , mustard-colored building on midtown Broadway , but leases it from the Metropolitan Opera and Real Estate Co . This organization is nothing more nor less than the owners of the Metropolitan 's 35 parterre boxes ( " Diamond Horseshoe " ) . Each box holder owns 300 shares of $100-par stock , and liability for a possible annual assessment up to $15 a share . <P> Manhattan society has let its hair down in recent years , no longer counts an opera box the chief symbol of eminence . Metropolitan box holders have begun to dodge their assessments . Last week the fact-facing news came out that the real-estate company is feeling the pinch , may face liquidation . So said its President Robert S. Brewster in a letter to the Opera Association 's Chairman Cornelius Newton Bliss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lease for next season ) asked for an option on the opera house for $1,500,000 ( one-third cash ) . Should the option contract be approved by the box holders , the Metropolitan would once more publicly pass the tin cup , as it did to keep going in 1933-35 . But this time the Metropolitan might well throw in its lot with The People , get the Diamond Horseshoe out of hock for good . <P> Last week the Detroit Symphony , needing $75,000 to complete a $280,000 budget for the approaching season , faced a problem much like the Metropolitan 's . In its 25 years , the Symphony raised $4,000,000 by passing the hat . Half the donations came from twelve old Detroit families , headed by such men as Senator James Couzens , Motorman Roy Dikeman Chapin , Banker Julius Haass , Milkman Jerome Remick-all dead today . A newer generation of motor manufacturers , which never had much time for music , or which was left out of cultural shindigs in the old days , now sits on its hands . The Symphony 's current drive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from 30 General Motors men , including $250 from President William S. Knudsen . Ford Motors pays $19,500 to the orchestra , which masquerades as the Ford Symphony on the radio . <P> Mrs. Hugh Dillman ( once Mrs. Horace Elgin Dodge ) , vice president of the Detroit Symphony , has given it some $1,000,000 in 20 years , but this year felt obliged to reduce her contribution from $50,000 to $30,000-top donation in the drive . Moreover , the Symphony has sadly missed its late , lionized Conductor Ossip Gabrilowitsch , whose successors , Coconductors Victor Kolar and Franco Ghione , are competent but barely kittenized.
