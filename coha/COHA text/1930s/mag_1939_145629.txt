Winnie Winkle the Breadwinner got on a bus one day last month , and for eight days readers of the Chicago Tribune and 140 other newspapers followed Cartoonist Martin Michael Branner 's heroine through a series of depressing experiences . She was annoyed by a traveling salesman , bored by a Shakespearean ham , sprawled over by a yokel couple . Many a reader guessed that Cartoonist Branner had gone somewhere on a bus and had n't liked it much . <P> Greyhound Lines and one T. R. McCabe , manager of the Cleveland branch of Beaumont &; Hohman , advertising agency which has the Greyhound account , thought the implication more sinister . Mr. McCabe brooded for a spell , then last week wrote the Tribune an angry letter demanding " to know immediately if the cartoonist has been approached by representatives of somebody interested in injuring the bus business . . . . Needless to say . . . " said Mr. McCabe with needless indirection , " it may be quite difficult for us to persuade our clients that any further advertising should be placed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Press " ) McCormick 's news paper only one reply was possible . The Tribune made it in an editorial that bore the imprint of the Colonel 's own choleric style . Snapped the " World 's Greatest Newspaper " : " We 're going to continue to edit the Tribune and Mr. McCabe is going to continue not to edit it . If Mr. McCabe thinks his client is n't getting its money 's worth . . . it is Mr. McCabe 's duty to cancel the contract . It 's all right with us either way , but if we get any more letters from Mr. McCabe like the last one we wo n't leave the decision to him . " Beaumont &; Hohman recanted.
