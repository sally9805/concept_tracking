txt An organizer for John L. Lewis ' Steel Workers ' Organizing committee ooasted last night that pressure from the office of Harr y Hopkins , chief of the Works Progress administration , had forced t h e Chicago Relief administration to give relief to 500 Republic Steel company strikers . Mel Pitzle , the organizer , made the boast before an audience of approximately 100 at a meeting to consider , the relief situation . The meeting , on the thirteenth floor at 203 North Wabash avenue , was dominated by representatives of unions affiliated with Lewis ' Committee for Industrial organization . Refusal to Work Charged . During more than a month of investigation of the Chicago relief situation the charge has often been heard that there are many persons on the rolls of the CRA Chicago Relief administration who do not want to work . It has been recognized that the only way to determine the exact number of such persons would be to offer every reli6fer a job in private industry to see actually whether or not he would work . The meeting last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation . it was presided over by Jerome Sampson , a member of the Social Service Workers ' union , a C. I. 0 . affiliate . Sampson is a case worker for the United Charities , a private relief agency . The C. 0 . Organizer 's Story . " The men on strike at the Republic plant reached the end of their resources and went to the CRA stations for aid , " Pitzle said . " They were bold by the relief people to go back to their jobs  --  that they were n't eligible for relief . In ether words , they were told to be scabs . " We immediately notified C. 0 . headquarters in Washington . John Lewis sent an attorney to see Harry Hopkins and within twenty-four hours Mr. Williams from Hopkins ' office was in Chicago . " Williams , Pitzle declared , offered to set up a special WPA project to take care of the strikers . Williams Is be  --  ieved to be Aubrey Williams , a field man and trouble shooter for Hopkins . His offer was refused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to picket the Republic plant and had no time to work on WPA . Relations Fine Now , He Says . " Mr. Williams arranged a conference with Mr. Lyons , " Pitzle continued . " Since then our relations with the CRA have been excellent . " Leo M. Lyons is commissioner of the CRA . He said Williams visited him last summer while the strike at the Republic plant was at its height . " Mr. Williams raised the question relative to the treatment of strikers by the CRA and asked if we were discriminating against them , " Lyons said . " 1 asked him if he knew of any special cases in which discrimination had been praticed . " He did not then , nor has he since called any such cases to my attention . I told him it was the policy of the CRA to give relief to persons solely on the basis of their need for relief without regard to their affiliation with any organization , labor or otherwise . " Organizer Calls on Lyons . Lyons said that he did not know whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rolls of the CRA . " Mr. Pitzle came to my office about two weeks ago , said that the SWOC had about reached the end of its resources , and asked me to send social workers into the district where the strikers live , " Lyons continued . " This I refused to do . " I repeated to Mr. Pitzle the statement that I had made to Mr. WilHams  --  that relief is given solely on the basis of need and not on the basis of a person 's affiliation with an organization . " Lyons also revealed that Miss Edith Foster , head of the social service department of the Chicago regional office of WPA , accompanied Pitzle to Lyons ' office to see If certification of the strikers for WPA jobs could not be rushed , The CRA sends formal notification to the WPA that reiterant are dot ! ? tute and eligible for WPA . This certification process was stopped last summer but resumed last month . Lyons said ho supposed the strikers , if they were eligible , would bo cartined , as would any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night for information on any special job she may have in mind that would allow the strikers to draw WPA checks while picketing the Republic plant . Clients Kept on Relief . The investigation of the last month has shown that the relief machine is geared to keeping people on relief rather than toward getting them back into private employment . The social workers can not solve the problem of fitting renders into private Industry . They are interested in giving relief and social aid to the reRefers . Getting them employed is not the social workers ' task . The law allows the CRA to spend 8 per cent of its funds on aciministration , Thus , as the money available for relief varies , the amount that can be spent for hiring social workers and clerical help varies too . At the present time there are approximately 1,600 employes on the CRA pay roll , of whom about half are social workers , who visit reliefers , decide how much their budgets are , and listen to their , Woes . Rules Are Laid Down . The standards under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago by a personnel committee functioning Under the Illinois emergency relief commission , made up of professional sociologists , including representatives from Loyola and Northwestern universities , the University of Chicago , and social workers In private and public relief agencies , They decreed that none except those who have certain academic quailfications In social studies could become anything more than an emergency case worker , with a salary limit of $100 a month . The following qualifications are necessary for one who wishes to become a junior case worker at a salary of from $105 to 8115 a month : " Six full courses in an accredited school of social work , including two full courses of supervised field work in a casework field , completed In full or in part while an undergraduate student . " Basle for Promotion . Beyond this point promotion deponds upon either further academic training or practical experience in greater degree . The highest paid jobs In the district offices are those of the district supervisors , who receive $200 a month . Case loads , or the number of cases assigned to each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 220 , The social workers complain ' that this is too great a load for each worker . They would like to have more time to work on individual cases of social maladjustment in their families . In the long run , they say , it will be cheaper if social maladjustments , such as health conditions and discord in the home , are taken care of at once than allowed to drift along .
