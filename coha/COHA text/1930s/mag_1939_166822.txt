" The aim of Italy 's foreign policy , " says Harold Nicolson , British M. P. , essayist , novelist , onetime diplomat , " is to acquire by negotiation an importance greater than can be supplied by her own physical strength . It is thus the antithesis of the German system , since instead of basing diplomacy on power she bases power on diplomacy . It is the antithesis of the French system , since instead of striving to secure permanent allies against a permanent enemy , she regards her allies and her enemies as interchangeable . It is the antithesis of the British system , since it is not durable credit that she seeks for , but immediate advantage . Her conception , moreover , of the Balance of Power is not identical with the British conception ; for whereas in Great Britain that doctrine is interpreted as opposition to any country who may seek to dominate Europe , in Italy it is desired as a balance of such equipoise that her own weight can tilt the scale . " <P> Last week Italy not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way toward changing allies when Il Duce violently shook up the Fascist hierarchy . The side-changing had been hopefully expected by Great Britain and France for some weeks , but few had supposed so many big Government heads would roll in accompaniment . <P> A favorite phrase among Italian Fascisti is " changing of the guard . " It refers to a supposedly fixed policy of rotating the Party 's big men in the State 's big jobs ; actually it is usually used to make crucial political shifts seem casual and routine . Last week , when Italy 's hierarchy was violently shaken up , the phrase was shouted loud on Rome 's seven hills . But no amount of inspired pooh-poohing could make the changes unimportant . <P> Out went : <P> &gt;Lieut . General Achille Starace , Secretary of the Fascist Party , who for eight years has stood close enough behind Benito Mussolini to tickle his shoulder blades with a stiletto . With sense of humor zero and self-confidence unlimited , Fascist Starace earned the nickname " Pantherman " by feats of physique-jumping a horse over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plunging through rings of fire . In his gaudy office , where he is protected by an always-loaded , pearl-handled revolver and by a solid gold Virgin , he has thought up many a mystic fetish , many a fiendish thuggery . He abolished the handshake in Italy . He designed the black Fascist uniform . He is generally supposed to have been one of the inventors of the castor-oil technique of punishing political recalcitrants . And he has been one of the most important nuts keeping Rome tightly screwed to the Axis . <P> &gt;Minister of Public Culture Oboardo Dino Alfieri . One of the founders of Fascism , a friend of Mussolini since World War I , smoothie , trouble shooter , woman-charmer ( Italians say he could make an Englishwoman feel beautiful and an Ethiopian feel important ) , he consistently boosted the Axis in the Italian press-until the war began .
