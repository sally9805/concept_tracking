A KINNY , red- faced young- ster , going three thousand miles away from his New England home and fireside to seek his baseball fortune in a major-league training camp , sat huddled in a Pullman , observed everything , but spoke nary a word , from the city of Chicago to the ? island kingdom of the Wrigleys , Catalina . A newspaperman , as Irish as the lad he had been studying , stood the silence as long as he could , and then blared forth , that all might hear : " There 's the gabbiest guy that ever went on a spring-training trip . " Thus entered into the ranks of the Chicago Cubs , the National League , and eventually , unless a great many baseball folk are wrong , into Baseball 's Hall of Fame , Charles Leo ( Gabby ) Hartnett . That was in 1922 . The same Hartnett , no longer reserved , but bubbling over with energy that at times seems explosive , having established a majorleague catching record for steady service that will likely endure , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the lone exception of the scout who found him , the sole survivor of seventeen frenzied baseball years . In the fall of ' 37 he completed with the Cubs the thirteenth season in which he caught more than 100 games . Only Ray Schalk , of the old Chicago White Sox , had ever done anything like that in major-league baseball . And not even Schalk , or Johnny Kling , Jimmy Archer , or any of the other storied catchers of Chicago baseball history ever came close to Gabby Hartnett in a hold on the paying public . Perhaps this was best illustrated in the sudden appointment of Hartnett as manager of the Cubs last season , succeeding Charlie Grimm . It was a sudden move on the part of the owner , P. K. Wrigley , but it was not unexpected . For years , Hartnett seemed destined one day to manage the club with which his entire major-league playing career had been bound up . Indeed , as things went none too well for Grimm in the last few seasons , there was what amounted to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Grimm became ill , late in the season , the club was turned over to Hartnett . It went into a winning streak at once , and gained , the top of the league . Grimm returned later , and for one reason or another the Cubs folded and the Giants came on to win the pennant . During the winter , Wrigley expressed the opinion that the Cubs probably would have won had Hartnett remained as manager . He was not prepared then to make the managerial change . He decided that in mid-season of last year . " Hartnett was entitled to the job , " Wrigley said , " and he was Grimm 's logical successor . But be was not made manager for those reasons . I wanted to be sure , first , that he was the best man for the job . I studied the situation , myself . I qUestioned hundreds of persons  --  fans , baseball people of every capacity , players , other managers , league executives , club owners and officials , even umpires . Their opinion was unanimously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he has played under six  --  has not hesitated in calling Hartnett the greatest catcher the game has ever known . This manager speaks with some authority , too , for he is Joe McCarthy , of the old school , present manager of the New York Yankees , and the only man who has ever won pennants in both National and American leagues . As a ball player , Gabby is definitely old school . Some players pick their spots . Some like ' em hot , some like ' em cold . Gabby never pinks his spots . But he likes ' om hot . Whore the going is toughest , that 's where Gabby wants to be . He 's the kind of II competitor who delivers in the clutch . The events of the most dramatic baseball aftern ? 011 01 ' last year prove that . Hollywood 's wildest , dream will never approach the dramatic- climax reached on the afternoon of last September twentyeighth in Wrigley Field , Chicago . Gabby was still a debutante manager . His Cubs were half a game behind the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight straight games . The score was tied at five to five in the last half of the ninth . Two out. , nobody on base . Manager Hartnett stepped to the plate . There never was a tighter clutch . Night was blacking out the field . It was clear to all of the 34,465 tense fans in the stands that , after Gabby 's turn at bat , the game would he called on account of darkness . Mace Brown , relief star for the Pirates , tossed a curve . Gabby 's bat did n't leave his shoulder . Strike one . Gabby swung on the next one and missed . It looked as though Gabby , mighty Gabby , might emulate Casey , mighty Casey . Brown uncorked his fast one . Gabby swung again . Everybody in the park heard the crack as bat met ball . The ball rocketed into the night . And it seemed as though everybody in the left-field bleachers was reaching for it the next instant . As Gabby circled the bases , thousands rushed for him . Half of Chicago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darkness . Scores of rooters fought to touch his dirty uniform . The Hit That Won a Pennant T HAT blow sank the Pirates . That blow put the Cubs out in front and catapulted them into the World Series with the Yankees . Catcher Hartnett had delivered for Manager Hartnett in the tightest of clutches . Catcher Hartnett had made Manager Hartnett a miracle man by bringing home the bacon with his own big bat . Gabby 's very presence on the ball field commands attention . His infectious smile , his roaring greeting to friends that he counts by the thousand in every city he visits , his career-long policy of asking no quarter and giving none are reminiscent of what baseball 's graybeards are pleased to term the " good old days . " But Hartnett is essentially modern , goodnatured , and well qualified to know his way around in any company , anywhere . In Chicago , which has not been without its baseball heroes from Pop Anson 's time down , Hartnett is the people 's choice and the returns from outlyingprecincts of the major @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poll . Capitalization on Hartnett 's great personal popularity began with his appointment as manager . It is a matter of record that the first half-dozen games played after his taking charge were witnessed by a crowd total greater than any other half-dozen-game period in all Cub history . It was undoubtedly the suggestion of the old school about Hartnett that attracted him to a Cub scout , or vice versa , while a member of the Worcester club in 1921 . Hartnett had been rescued by Worcester from a county-fair game at Uxbridge , Massachusetts . The scout was gnarled . lack Doyle , one-time flame thrower for the rough-and-ready Baltimore Orioles that had given to baseball John McGraw , Hughey Jennings , Willie Keeler and others of the sort who would willingly have given a lion the first two bites before regarding the contest as even . Doyle , still scouting the canebrakes and the tall uncut for the Cubs , always has fancied big men , and Hartnett was big , if rawboned , in those days . He has acquired some aldermanic proportions since , and there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when his teammates called him " Puffy . " Doyle , unbeknown to Hartnett , rode beside him on a car to the Albany ball park . " He had a strong puss , " says Doyle , who is inordinately proud of having discovered Hartnett . " Puss " is Baltimore Oriole for face , and in order to appreciate how that figured in Doyle 's calculations , we must detour for a moment , A few years ago , Doyle recommended a pitcher to the Cubs . Seemingly , the pitcher had all that was needed in the way of fast ball and curve . He was big and strong . But he had great difficulty in getting anyone out . One day in the Polo Grounds , New York , Hartnett was out . of uniform because of a finger injury . He sat with Doyle and the two watched the pitcher , who was making another try , and failing , against the Giants . " I 've been looking at that guy close , " said Doyle , " and he 's got a weak puss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the minor leagues . That 's the only way to tell whether a guy will battle for you . Look at that Frank Demaree . There 's a strong puss for you . When he sticks that jaw out , he 'd scare anybody . " in the ball game at Albany , Doyle saw Hartnett block a runner at the plate . He was n't spike-shy . He had what it takes . That was enough for Doyle . He likes men who like the hot spots , men who go where the fighting is . That evening Hartnett , like all youngsters in their first year of professional baseball , a bit shy on funds , approached his manager and asked for a couple of dollars " eating money . " " He gave me five , " says Hartnett , " and told me to send it back to him from Chicago next year . That was the first I knew I had been sold to the Cubs . " It would he nice to relate that Hartnett was a tremendous success from taw . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catalina Island were over , Manager Bill Killefer brought the Cubs to Los Angeles to begin an exhibition series . Present at the time were Bill Veerk , the club 's president , John 0 . Seys , then traveling secretary , and Doyle , the scout . Of the three , only Doyle is now alive . Killefer approached them and announced that he was going to send Hartnett away . He was reporting to Veeck , of course , but the voices of Doyle and Seys were raised in protest . But he has n't caught a game , " they said . " Why not give him that chance ? " Killefer agreed , if reluctantly . Hartnett caught that afternoon , well enough to stay the descent of the spring-training as . That was the nearest he has ever been to leaving the Cub pay roll since the day his name went on it . In his early days as a Cub regular , Hartnett , a free swinger , struck out a lot. , and was the target for plenty of jeering from Cub fans , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ However , many of those same scoffers remained to become charter members of the Hartnett Cheering Society , whose entire roster now will not admit that Gabby can do a wrong . There is something of a contradiction in Hartnett 's nature . On the field , effusive , noisy and a magnificent actor of his star part , Gabby 's private life is very much his own . Unlike most ballplayers , be is a resident and taxpayer in the city he represents on the field . And the Hartnett home life is the Hart-netts ' . Married in 1929 to Martha Marshall , Hartnett has two children , Charles Leo , Jr. ? otherwise Buddy  --  and Sheila Ann . Buddy is nine , and Sheila Ann is four . Buddy has n't paid much attention to baseball , as yet . He is too busy in his spare time constructing model airplanes. fl New England Champion " I 'm not worried about him in that regard , " says Gabby . " Why , when I was ten , and living in Nlillville , Massachusetts , my greatest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of New England . I 'm not sure that I was n't , either . I sold as many as sixty quarts I had picked to one Indy . Got fifteen cents a quart too . I had the reputation as a clean berry picker . No greenies or crushed berries . " The Hartnetts do little or no entertaining at home . And Mrs. Hartnett , unlike most wives of ballplayers , and especially star ballplayers , can take her baseball or leave it alone . " If I were driving a truck , " says Hartnett , " I 'd not expect my wife to be riding on the seat beside me to see how I was doing , would I ? Well , baseball 's just as much my business , and the ball park is the place for that . When I 'm home , that 's where I enjoy being with my family . They are not a part of baseball , and that 's the way it 's going to be . " In his off-season stretches , Hartnett likes to play bridge and pinochle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in each . He will play in a friendly pinochle game , or take part in a hand or two of bridge . But not when there is much betting . Horsehide Nlm rods " I do n't believe in that , " he says . " Ballplayers that bet high on cards have too many things on their minds . I always say that if you show me a ballplayer who saves his money , I 'll show you a good ballplayer . " For that reason Hartnett rarely makes a bet on a horse race . Most ballplayers , and especially Cubs since Hornsby 's time , like huge steaks . Rogers Hornsby , while managing the club , advocated steaks as a means to a high batting average . Hartnett does n't go much for steaks . He likes roasts , though . He likes to play golf , and is a fine golfer , but rarely indulges in the game in the regular baseball season . Once a year , in the period between the close of one baseball season and the opening of another , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of quarry . " I like to hunt pheasants and ducks , " he says . " And I like to hunt deer , After the season , I generally go on a trip to shoot elk , moose and bear . I ca n't pi much for that goat shooting at Catalina . Too much like firing at a cow . " Hartnett regards his former clubmate , Pat Malone , as one of baseball 's best rifle shots , Lon Warneke , also a former Cub , is another good shot . " But the boys built him up into a sort of latter-day Deadeye Dick , " says Hartnett . " Lon is n't that good with a rifle . But with a baseball ? " Hartnett broke into the major leagues on the top floor , as it were . When the 1922 season opened at Cincinnati , the youngster was playing his first major-league ball game . More than that , he was seeing his first majorleague ball game , since that was the first time he had ever been in a majorleague park . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I was . I had never seen that many people at a ball game in my life . And I had to catch Alex . Not that there was anything tough about that . You could sit in a rocking chair and catch Old Pete , for there never has been a pitcher that I have seen who could put the ball where he wanted it like Alex could . It will always be a regret to me that when I came up with the Cubs , Alex was beginning to fade . He must have been as great as the greatest when he had it . I 'll always be grateful to him , for , after I had caught him that first time , he went to Killefer , the boss , who had caught him so many times , and said , ' Bill . the kid 's all right . ' I 've had a good many nice things written about me and said about me in fifteen years , but that little speech of Old Pete is the one I remember . I 've still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ended , and treasure it , as I do the glove I used . Alex fanned Babe Pinelli for the last out . That 's how I happened to get the ball . " If Hartnett had his thrill over his first major-league game , he had another one coming . That was the time when he registered his first hit in the big show . " We were playing at St. Louis , " says Hartnett , " and Killefer sent me in to bat in the pinch for Vic Aldridge . I got hold of one and drove it out to right center . I lit out for first , all excited , and was still watching the ball when I rounded the base . My feet caught in the bag and down I went , plowing up a couple of feet of ground with my face . I got up and got as far around as third , at that . " Hub , the Giant Killer These incidents are described by Hartnett as worthy of his remembrance , but if properly cross examined , he will always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ National League 's No. 1 catcher in the first five of these games . With his own manager , Charlie Grimm , directing , and three , other Cubs , Bill Herman , Augie Galan and Frank Demaree , in action , Gabby helped win the 1936 game , the first the National League ever won . He does n't talk much about that , but likes to go back to Carl Hubbell and 1934 . He will go over , pitch by pitch , that memorable two innings of the All-Star game in which Hub fanned , in succession , Babe Ruth , Lou Gehrig , Jimmy Foxx , Al Simmons and Joe Cronin . Does he then rate Hubbell as his alltime greatest ? Not exactly . " I 'll have to take Dizzy Dean , " says Hartnett ; " and that is n't because ho is now one of our pitchers either . I felt that way about him when he was with St. Louis . But I do want to say that , sore arm or no , since he has been with us , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the greatest in his career . He is a great competitor , the greatest of all baseball 's showmen . I might straddle the issue and call Hub the greatest left bander , and Old Diz the greatest right bander . But 1 ' 11 still take Old Diz . Alex , of course , was on the downgrade when I caught him . " Hartnett , incidentally , had more than a little to do with the urging of Owner Wrigley to acquire Dizzy Dean . It was suggested at a conference at the Catalina training camp , last spring , Hartnett voicing the opinion that the club needed another ranking pitcher . It cost Wrigley 8185,000 and three players to get Dean , and there is no available estimate how much more it cost in medical surveys for the time Old Diz remained in idleness , his sore arm sharing the publicity glare with the growing conflagration that was to burn away the managerial portfolio held by Grimm . Dean 's fichilles Toe Old Diz  --  the man of a few thousand words , generally about himself  --  broke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hartnett , in one of the AllStar games . " If I had that guy to pitch to all the time , " said Diz , " I 'd never lose me a game . " The time came , and in the 1937 AllStar game , when Old Diz , along with Hubbell , Mungo , Grissom , and practically all the rest of the National League except President Ford Frick , was so rudely handled by a parcel of New York Yankees and some other fellows in the guise of American League All-Stars . Old Diz explained his misfortune in that game as directly due to his " shaking off " Hartnett on a pitch . He was hit on the toe with a rifle shot from an American League batsman . His own analysis is that all his troubles for the rest of the 1937 season and the early part of 1935 were duo to that , When he joined the Cubs he would have no catcher but Hartnett , and before and after his twelve-week layoff from pitching duty , Old Diz , no longer " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Hartnett 's signals . Given perfect control , in one of hisgames against the Giants  --  whom he allowed but five hits  --  Old Diz threw just 88 balls in the nine innings . It was that game which Hartnett , then Dean 's manager as well as catcher , characterized as one of the greatest exhibitions Dean had ever given . It . began to look then , since that was Dean 's fifth win for the Cubs , without a defeat , as if there was something to his statement of a. few years back that , with Hartnett as his catcher , he would never lose a game . It was Hartnett 's ill luck that the first World Series that he ever attended in the uniform of one of the contestants was the one in which he could n't play . That was in 1929 , when he was out all season with a sore arm that threatened to close his entire career . His few appearances for the Cubs that year were restricted to pinch hitting . He characterizes the seventh inning of the fourth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than all other evils that have befallen him , including the debacle of Manager Hartnett 's Cubs in the dreary World Series of last fall . That was the inning in which the Athletics fell upon the Cubs , and kept on falling until they had wiped out an 8 to 0 lead against them , scored ten runs on ten hits and won the game . Charley Root , still with the Cubs , had held the Athletics to two hits . Al T HEX ' are remarkable because they did one thing which the great majority of men and women never do .

Jimmy Foxx singled . So did Bing Miller , Jimmy Dykes singled , and Foxx scored . Joe Holey singled , and Miller scored . George Burns , a pinch hitter , popped out . " I was sitting beside Joe McCarthy , on the bench , " said Hartnett . " Up to I hen , he was n't worried much . We still had a big lead . But when Max Bishop got a hit , and scored Dykes , making it S to 4 , McCarthy chased Art Neill out to pitch . Mule Haas was the hitter . He hanged a kind of a line fly right out at Hack Wilson , in center . Hack never did see that ball in the sun . When he finally got it back , two more runs were in and Haas was on second . McCarthy ordered Mickey Cochrane pas.sed , and sent Sheriff Blake in to pitch to Simmons , up for the second time . Simmons hit one and scored Haas . Then Foxx hit one and Cochrane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I can still hear McCarthy asking no one in particular , ' What can I do ? ' But I did n't know , either . Pat Malone wont in to pitch . He soaked Miller with a pitch , and the first thing we knew , Dykes unloaded a double , two runs scored , and it did n't matter much that Malone did fan the last two men . I never want to see anything like that again . You can talk all you want about New York Yankee power , but I 'll bet that even McCarthy , who is directing it now , will never forget the Athletics of 1929 . " To McCarthy , Hartnett gives his sincere praise as the greatest all-around manager for whom he has ascr worked , in a list which began with Killefer and ranged through Rabbit hiaranville , George Gibson , McCarthy , Rogers Hornsby and on to firimm , One-Play Gabby " I think McCarthy knew more baseball than any other manager I ever saw in action or worked for , " says Hartnett . But that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handle men . He had understanding , and he was a great disciplinarian , while never losing his standing with all of us as a great guy . If there is. a system to baseball , as there is to football , I 'd say McCarthy 's is best . At all events , I think his record comes close to proving it , does n't it ? " Grimm , whom Hartnett supplanted as manager , went his way singing the praises of his successor . There was always a strong bond of friendship between the two , and even the internal turmoil of a baseball situation that has had few parallels in the major leagues could not snap that bond . To Grimm , as to all the other managers for whom he had played , Hartnett gave everything he had , and all knew that . " Let 's assume that he 's the greatest catcher you or I will ever see , " said Grimm , " and let me tell you about the time he played first base . I was with Pittsburgh then . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was something the matter with the regular first baseman , and who walked EVENING POST out for practice but Hartnett . In fielding practice he looked like Stuffy McInnis grown up . He shifted his feet , fired that ball around Its only Hartnett can . He handled the ball like a right , handed Hal Chase . We were properly ins pressed . " Well , the game began . The first man up for us was Higbee . He dribbled one of those mean , slow , twisting rollers down the line . Hartnett came charging in . The pitcher came charging over . Higbee came tearing down the line . All four ? Hartnett , the pitcher , Higbee and the ball  --  got to the same place at the same time . Everybody piled up . Hartnett 's glove went one way . He went another . They never did find his cap . Finally order was restored , Hartnett announced that he was ready , and play went on . Or started to . But out from the Cubs ' dugout came Killefer , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put into the game . Chicago fans should be grateful that One-Play Hartnett finished his career as a first baseman there and then . I 'll guarantee you he 'd have been killed in action if Killefer had n't taken him out there and then . " But Hartnett does n't list that as his funniest experience . He goes into the Polo Grounds in John McGraw 's time for that . " You know , " he says , " how McCraw used to eat his Giants alive if they let themselves be nailed in double plays ? Well , we 're playing them one day and Heinle Mueller was on first base with two out . He forgot that . All he was thinking about was that even if he got forced at second , ho must prevent the double play . The batter hit one down to Sparky Adams , who was playing second for us . Adams gave it to the shortstop , Cooney , forcing out Mueller and retiring the side . But just from force of habit , Cooney started his throw to first base @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start . He leaped in the air to block it , and was hit squarely in the mouth . Fobruclry 11,19.151 I guess ho was the only man in baseball history who over broke up a double play for McGraw after the side had been retired . " Hartnett regards Joe Medwick , of the St. Louis Cardinals , as the most formidable hitter he has ever attempted to help a pitcher outguess . " Hornsby was the tops , until Medwick really began to hit , " says Hart , nett . " We 've been trying everything on Joe for years , and it does n't seem to do much good . His weakness , as the saying is , is a base on balls . " Poison Pitchers Hartnett 's idea of an ideal ballplayer , smooth working , effortless , but highly efficient , is Charley Gehringer , of the Detroit Tigers . " That guy hits Hubbell like he owns him , " says Hartnett , which is tops in praise for a National Leaguer . Baseball folks generally look on Hartnett as a worthy batsman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him earn every hit he makes . " I do n't think of , offhand , one pitcher I like to hit more than another , " he says . " But I can tell you three that I was glad to see get out of the league . They were l3urleigh Grimes , Art Nehf and Ray Kremer . Oh , yes , do n't forget that Lefty Grove . Remember how he fanned me those couple of times I hatted in the 1929 series , and again in the first All-Star game ? Still , I caught up with him , finally . I got a hit off him in spring training in 1936 and a triple in the All-Star game that year . But Grimes , Nehf and Kremer did n't hold still long enough for me . " The toughest base mailer to corral ? " Never could be anybody else but Pepper Martin , of the Cardinals , " says Hartnett . " Why , if that guy could steal first base , he 'd heat you out of a ball game all by himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detect weakness in opposing hitters is a large part of a catcher 's job , listen to Hartnett on these matters . " When a new player comes along and hits us , we start working different things on him . So do the other clubs , if he is still going good . Word gets around the league that way . Only trouble is , then , getting your pitchers to put the ball in the right spot . Lack of that kind of control has ruined more pitchers than anything else I can think of , except one thing , and that is lack of heart . I 've always said that if it were possible to cut Charley Root 's heart up into twenty-five chunks and transplant them in that many other pitchers , I 'd have twenty-five great pitchers in no time . You can develop curves and fast balls , change of pace , sinkers , screw balls , knucklers , and everything else . But you 're either born with a heart or without one . You do n't acquire one .

MEMai 88 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST rear ... sr. rot ? , .. 4 .17 Ballplayer 's Ballplayer Hartnett himself catches one pitcher about as another . He has expressed himself on the subject of tough pitchers to handle . He thinks Sheriff Blake was the worst . Blake had a tremendous lot of stuff and was wild . That always makes for a rough day for the catcher . Hartnett termed Lon Warneke one of the easiest pitchers to handle , largely because of Warneke 's superb control . There is n't a player on the Cub squad who does n't like Hartnett , and some of the youngsters idolize him . Every one of them looks upon him as the ideal managerial type . Angie Galan , a comparative youngster in the big leagues , tells of the first day Hartnett took over the management of the club in 1937 , when Grimm was stricken and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our meeting before the game , " said Galan , " Hartnett could n't keep from laughing . He wanted to be serious , and he was seri ous . But every once in a while it struck him as funny . Still he ran the ball club , as we all knew he would . He had his own way of doing things . Nobody got bawled out in the dugout. , or even spoken to for doing sometting ' wrong . But the next day at the meeting there was n't a thing Hartnett had missed . He went over all the mistakes and talked about them . In that way we were all pretty much on guard against making that mistake again . " When Hartnett was made manager in the midst of last year 's race , his players actually exceeded their own ability in an effort to show how they felt about Gabby . That went . from the biggest star to the lowliest rookie . But for our purposes , perhaps the expression of Tony Lazzeri , now no longer a Cub , had best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Cubs after the 1937 season , in which he was a WorldSeries hero with the Yankees . Many felt that he was being groomed for the management of the Cubs . All were certain that his presence would lead to complications . All were wrong . From the first , Lazzeri , who sees much and says little , hit it of with Grimm , and hit it off with Hartnett , who had been designated as a coach as well as player , when the 1938 season began . When Hartnett was named manager , there was a big demand of the photographers for posed pictures of Hartnett and Lazzeri , together . Lazzeri was n't very affable about that . " I know what they 've got in mind , " he said . " They want to write under them something about how Gabby and I are going to get along , or are n't going to get along . They do n't say nothing , but I know what they 've got in mind . But all I 've got to say about this is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All I hope is that he 'll find some place for me to get into the games every day so I can show him where I stand . Or maybe I should say , show the public where I stand . Gabby knows . He 's my friend , and he 's going to be a great manager . " Looking back over his major-league career , Hartnett is willing to pick his own All-Star team , with a few ideas on American Leaguers gained from All-Star games , spring-training exhibitions and World-Series play . He lists Gus Mancuso , of the New York Giants , as the best National League catcher he has seen . His first baseman is Bill Terry , manager of the Giants . His second baseman is Frankie Frisch , former manager of the Cardinals . His shortstop is Frank Crosetti , of the Yankees . His third baseman is Pie Traynor , now.manager of the Pittsburgh Pirates . His outfield gave him some thought , but he settled for IvIedwiek , Chick Haley and Ross Young , deceased , once a star of McGraw 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last World Series than I ever want to see against me again , " Hartnett says . " I know now who is the spark of that ball club . I hesitated a bit about naming Frisch over Billy Herman . Frisch , though , was a wonder when he was at his best with the Giants and later with the Cardinals . Not so good as Gehringer , of Detroit , though . I like Lou Gehrig , of the Yankees , too , but I 'll need some argument to put him on my team over Terry . I guess we 'd have to make a place for Babe Ruth on the team , and I know we would for Joe DiMaggio . He 's the best ballplayer in the game today , doing anything . As long as we did n't get , him , I 'm glad my old boss , McCarthy , did . " Dizzy Dean , Hubbell and Van Mungo , at their best , were his pitching selections . Which one was the fastest pitcher " fast " in baseball parlance meaning speed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Hartnett . " There has been only one fast pitcher in the National League in my time , Dazzy Vance . We had a little fellow named Clyde BeA on our club , years ago , when Vance was at tops . When Brooklyn was in town , Beck would come out on the field cautiously and peek around . If he saw Vance taking batting practice , which meant it was his turn to pitch , Beck would pick up his own bat and put it under the bench . " Hack Wilson would come storming out on the field , and start yelling at Vance , telling him what we were going to do to that ' broken-arm ' delivery of his . I do n't think Hack ever got a good foul off Vance , but that did n't stop him from trying , or yelling . " Beck would walk over to Hack and ask him to please be quiet . I can still hear him saying : ' Please , Hack , I got to play today too . ' " Hartnett has a way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be raving and ranting around the home plate , the chief figure in many a heated session . But he seldom gets chased from the games any more . There was a time , though , when he was always getting bounced , especially by Bill Klem . " McCarthy finally got Klem and me straightened around , " says Hartnett . " We get along fine now . " The umpires like Hartnett because he never puts up a squawk unless he thinks there is one coming . Umpires appreciate that . Indeed , there is on record an incident of a few years back , when Dolly Stark , umpiring behind the plate in a Cub-Cardinal game at Chicago , was felled with a foul tip . Hartnett steadied Stark as the umpire reeled around . Stark had to be assisted from the field , eventually , and the first-base umpire prepared to don mask , shin guards , chest protector and what not to go behind the plate . Out of the Cardinal dugout boiled Manager Frisch , the No . I umpire baiter of the league , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Never mind putting another umpire behind there ! Hartnett 's done a swell job of calling ' em so far this afternoon ! " Like umpires ? " They 're my pals , " says Hartnett . " Do you know that when I was sixteen years old I caught a game pitched by Bill Stewart , now a National League umpire ? I had the mumps , and darn near died the next day . I was to get two dollars for catching the game . 1 have n't got it yet . " But that was all , it seems , in this game of baseball that Charles Leo Hartnett has ever missed .
