When on any issue Alf Landon joins Al Smith . William Green joins John Lewis , Georgia Baptists and Tennessee Episcopalians join Manhattan rabbis , cafeteria workers join Chambers of Commerce , sportsmen join clubwomen . President Conant of Harvard joins Presidents Dykstra of Wisconsin and Wilbur of Stanford , something momentous has happened in U. S. public life . Last week such a thing had happened . All these and other signs indicated that the U. S. people were unitedly aroused . <P> U. S. feelings were outraged as U. S. feelings had not been outraged since the sinking of the Lusitania , and once again the outrager was the German Government . Long since had U. S. citizens become a little ashamed of having called Germans " Huns " and " Bodies " during the War , but last week , although the epithets were not revived , Adolf Hitler 's super-pogrom had succeeded in arousing similar feelings of horror and contempt . <P> The danger of war did not loom as it loomed in 1915 , but press , pulpit and meeting house were the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , " I do n't know what our dear Lord Jesus would think if he were to come back to earth today and see what his Christian babies are doing . " And citizens of White Plains , N. Y. called on Charles A. Lindbergh and Henry Ford to return medals they lately accepted from Germany . <P> Last week when his press conference assembled , Franklin Roosevelt brushing aside other subjects , picked up a typewritten sheet and , in cold accents so deliberate that reporters could take it down verbatim , he read : " The news of the past few days from Germany has deeply shocked public opinion in the United States . Such news from any part of the world would inevitably produce a similar profound reaction among American people in every part of the nation . <P> " I myself could scarcely believe that such things could occur in a twentieth century civilization . " He then explained that he had ordered Ambassador Hugh Wilson home from Berlin not by way of formal recall , but to gain " a first-hand picture . " * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the strongest ever directed by a U. S. President at a " friendly " power . Later , White House Secretary Steve Early explained that it was intended to apply to outrages upon Catholics as well as Jews . <P> Three days elapsed before Adolf Hitler &; Co. replied to Franklin Roosevelt . They did so in the same idiom as Ambassador Wilson 's recall . Ambassador Hans Dieckhoff was ordered home from Washington to explain what the official Nazi news agency called the " eigenartig " ( " singular " ) attitude of the U. S. <P> Singular was the U. S. attitude in one respect : on a question of foreign affairs , concerning which it seldom has much feeling , the U. S. public had spontaneously expressed a strong national feeling . President Roosevelt had a mandate from the people which he was bound to translate into foreign policy .
