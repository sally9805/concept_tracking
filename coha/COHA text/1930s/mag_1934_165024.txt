Holding most of Cuba 's guns , little Generalissimo Fulgencio Batista last week went President-making . So unimpressed was this quarter white , quarter black , quarter Chinese , quarter Indian by the politicos ' choice early last week of Carlos Hevia y Reyes Gavilan that he cut off Cabana Fortress ' 21-gun salute to the New President at the count of nine . Gently he began to move his troops into Havana , to police stations , doorways , roofs . His chief opponent , ex-President Grau 's ubiquitous Secretary of War , Navy and Interior Antonio Guiteras , a onetime pharmacist who had somehow got Cuba 's 1,000 sailors in his pocket , fled to a Cuban gunboat in the harbor . A few amiable soldiers and civilians stood guard around President Hevia 's palace . Getting the heavy scent of trouble , the ABC revolutionary society boys handed around a fresh shipment of guns . Two days after he had been sworn in , President Hevia suddenly sent his resignation , not to his father-in-law Supreme Court Justice Edelman who had administered the oath , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shirts into his bags and led his wife , little daughter and brother-in-law out of the Presidential Palace . <P> Again the politicos , young and old , put their heads together . Threatened with a general strike , they gave scant heed to the " revolutionary program " of last September . The big thing now was U. S. recognition . They were still bickering over Batista 's candidate when they were jolted out of their chairs by the sound of Cabana Fortress guns . Boom-Boom-Boom - 21 times . <P> Cuba had a fresh President , that grand old man of the old line politicos , Carlos Mendieta y Montefur . Exhausted by his all-night job , Batista was still sound asleep that noon when President Mendieta pushed through a cheering , laughing mob with 20 potent politico friends to take the oath of office from his predecessor 's well-trained father-in-law . <P> All that day and night Havanans danced in the streets , confident that President Roosevelt would soon recognize Mendieta 's government . Unembarrassed by the general belief that he was responsible for Batista 's making of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a destroyer to meet his boss , Secretary of State Cordell Hull , homing from the Pan-American Conference aboard the cruiser Richmond . He then rushed back on the destroyer to tell President Mendieta " informally " that President Roosevelt plans to recognize his government .
