txt The wave of panic that swept over Premier Koki Hirota and other members of the Japanese Government  --  even over most of the members of the Privy Council  --  has now subsided and they have returned to sanity and a balanced viewpoint , a normal and realistic outlook on the world and on Japan 's position therein . That panic , apparently due to fear that Soviet Russia was about to strike an armed blow at Japan through Chinese channels , has cost the empire dearly . Because of it , the Tokyo government concluded an ideological pact with Fascist Germany aimed at combating communism . Since such an agreement seems scarcely worth the trouble of signing and is so obviously unnecessary to secure the end desired , it aroused suspicions that there must be also ail secret German-Japanese military alliance against Soviet Russia . In addition there developed the corollary suspicion that Japan had en-1 tered the Fascist bloc of nations . Price Japan Must Pay The price that Japan is being called upon to pay from the internal political standpoint is as great or greater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the militarists and setting Japan once more among the normal nations . This latter struggle is now definitely under way , ' , and on its outcome much depends . If Japan is to go Fascist , then a regrouping of the nations of the world must take place . If Japan is to eschew fascism and military dominance , then the bloc of genuinely democratic powers will be materially strengthened . When the Imperial Diet reconvenes late next month the first major struggle between the Fascists and the Liberals will be staged . Leading members of all parties are planning to attack the government because of the gigantic budget , with its disproportionately large military and naval appropriations and the accompanying tax revision and bond issues entailed . They will attack the government beca use of its trend toward State socialism . particularly in the seminationalization of the electric power industry . They plan still other attacks on the German agreement , on the failure of the China and Russia policies and on the , agitation for the reform of the parliamentary system sought by the militarists. which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Japan . But the anti-Fascists are not waiting until January to begin their campaign . It is already well under way . So is the campaign of the Fascists . The Minister of War , Count niseichi Terauchi , was plainly on the defensive during interpellations in the committee charged with considering plans for parliamentary reform . The army was accused of seeking to establish a military dictatorship and to turn Japan into a Fascist camp . This Count Terauchi denied , but it remains a fact that the policies the army is seeking to implement are Fascist in nature . Army for Dictatorial Rule The army would curb the Diet . would make it impossible for a party man to serve as Premier , would place all financial institutions under the dictatorial control of the Minister of Finance , would create a sort of super-government of semi-permanent officials to determine national policies and an economic general staff to control all finance and industry . It looks with favor on the creation of a new political party of the extreme Rightists which would be to it what the Communist party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chancellor Hitler . It is this unmistakable trend toward fascism that has aroused the liberals , the believers in party government and the capitalists . They are already in action , and most of I the government ministers are with them . The resignation of Shigeru Yoshida as director of the Cabinet inquiry bureau has been demanded and accepted . Mr. Yoshida is one of the younger bureaucrats , is an out-and-out Fascist and thinks as one with the more extreme militarists . In the post he has been forced to quit he was a real power , since most of the data appearing before the Cabinet had to pass through his hands first . The Hirota government had scarcely taken office before Mr. Yoshida advanced the scheme of supergovernment to be placed over the regular Cabinet . This is now definitely rejected and is a dead issue unless the Fascists are powerful enough to revive it . Another liberal victory must be chalked up in the decision of the Finance Minister not to advance his scheme for creation of an economic general staff which would virtually control all finance and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protest to this plan that it has frightened the Finance Minister away from it . Fascist Party Is Forming On the other hand , the extreme Rightists are organizing a political party combining all Fascist elements . They are , as always , proclaiming their patriotism from the housetops . They would continue with Japan 's foreign policy as the policy of the mailed fist . The Fascist-Liberal battle now in progress in Japan must be watched with tremendous interest throughout the world . The Hirota Govern-ment , faced with suspicion abroad , faced with a non-cooperation policy on the part of both China and Russia , faced with serious criticism at home because of its blunders and failures , has regained its common sense and has cast in its lot with the Liberals again . The odds are with these Liberals , but in Japan upsets are common and only the events of the next few months will definitely prove whether Japan is to follow the path of the Anglo-Saxon nations or that of Nazi Germany .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
