Five Star Final is this season 's newspaper play . But , unlike its more cynical predecessors , it is an earnest paean of hate directed against tabloid journalism . By the middle of Act II the abuse has become so boundless that it is flogging a dead horse . <P> The New York Evening Gazette , a publication which could not value circulation more loved it not honor less , has decided to run the story of Nancy Voorhees , who was acquitted 20 years prior for murdering a man who tried to abandon her . As managing editor , it is the task of terse , authoritative Arthur Byron ( The Criminal Code ; One , Two , Three ! ) to have Nancy Voorhees sought out , to find what has happened to her . to point an unctuous moral for his readers . It so happens that news of the story breaks on the day that Nancy 's pretty but illegitimate daughter is to be married . Griefstricken , Nancy and the worthy man who has married her despite her shame , commit suicide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three revolving stages , 27 scenes ) Editor Byron joins Playwright Louis Weitzenkorn in excoriating his profession , justifying his actions on the grounds that " idealism wo n't put a patch on your pants . I 'm one newspaperman who 's going to have a comfortable old age . " But when he learns of the tragedy his paper has wrought , he tells his publisher what he thinks of him , stalks out of the office with a bitter laugh at himself . <P> Some of the lines in Five Star Final are unbelievably bad . At one point two colored characters engage in such minstrel show chatter as : " What am a suicide pact ? " And a bogus air enters during the scenes in which disillusioned reporters tell each other their troubles . The play has undeniable vitality , however , and provides a good deal of technical information on the inner workings of a gum-chewer sheetlet . Arthur Byron is masterful , makes completely credible the part of a tough , dogged newsman . <P> <P> Midnight . Last week Theatre Guild subscribers filed reverently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stairs past the bust of George Bernard Shaw and bumped right into a murder melodrama . For Midnight relates the tale of a law-abiding florist ( Frederick Perry ) who , as foreman of a jury , has sent a woman to the electric chair for killing a man . At the execution , Midnight , while newshawks are invading his home on one pretext or another to catch his reaction , the florist 's daughter ( Linda Watkins of June Moon ) staggers in with a revolver and the tale that she has just shot her lover . <P> Thereupon the florist 's ideas undergo a complete metamorphosis on the subject of capital punishment . He does everything he can to save his child . But Miss Watkins would undoubtedly go to the chair were it not for some impudent but sage political advice which Mr. Glenn Anders ( Hotel Universe ) , as a newspaper reporter , breathes into the ear of the district attorney . <P> Had Midnight ' any pretense toward dramatic excellence , it would naturally depend on balancing the two similar crimes . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more clarity than the killing of Miss Watkins ' vague boy friend .
