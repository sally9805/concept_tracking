txt The stock market as gauged by the DowJones industrial and railroad averages is back again in the critical position in which it found itself on March 3.3 . The unfavorable implications in the advance in the industrials to a new bull market high on March 6 , while the rails refused to go along , have been borne out at least to the extent that stock prices on the whole have made no progress whatsoever in the last five or six weeks . However , in view of the nearness of the critical point ( 149.81 in the industrial average it is well to remember that under the Dow thenry. a trend once established is assumed to persist until it in reversed by the action of the averages themselves . Thus far , the averages have done nothing to warrant the assumption that the upswing begun in Msreb , 1935 , has ended . Volume The fact that Thursday 's test of the March 13 lows occurred on turnover of 2.060.000 shares , compared with volume of 2.659.710 on March 13 and 2.916.050 on the even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Peter Hamilton , author of The Stock Mar- ' ket Barometer , wrote in March . 1926 , at a time ' ' the industrial average was not far from its current level : " When the average decline of 20 Industrial stocks in two trading days amounts to over seven points , a condition is earablished which rather accurately tests not merely the strength of the bull account , but the sincerity and conviction of the investment demand . ? ? ?

During this recovery strong interests who supported the market to help out weak holders distribute the stock they were compelled topurchase . The future course of the market turns on its ability to absorb this stock .

It is not true that such breaks mark the end of major movements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may be that the SEC and the new margin requirements have changed all that , and that such similarities as are now observable between current markets and those of the peat are purely accidental . But that , too , remains to be proved . In London A coincidence which may be of some interest if not of any Dow theory significance is that while the London stock market , as measured by the London Financial Times ' industrial and railroad averages , declined with the American market to its low for the last three months on March 13 , since that date the London market has steadily advanced until its rail shares are in new high ground for the recovery dating from 1932 and its industrials are less than 2% below their bull market high of February 12 , last . Advance in the American market since March , 1935 , has , of course , far outrun that in the British market . notwithstanding the past week 's declines here .

At Thursday night 's closing prices , the rails showed a net appreciation of 64% from their March . 1935 , low , compared with 56% for the industrials . Even on the current decline from their last highs of 51.27 for the rails and 161.99 for the industrials , the rails have done little worse than the industrials , the carriers having lost 54.5% of their immediately preceding advance , dating from December 28. 1935 , while the industrials have lost 47.3% of their corresponding move , from December 19. 1935.
