Proudest achievement of the socialist-minded Mexican Government is its school system . In 1910 Mexico had only 600 State-supported schools and 70% of its citizens were illiterate . But the post-revolution constitution of 1917 decreed free , secular education for all . By 1921 President Obregn began to send missionaries into the rural districts to establish secular schools . A constitutional amendment in 1934 gave the Government control of all primary and secondary education , directed that it should be socialistic . Today , despite the bitter opposition of the Roman Catholic Church to the new educational plan , Mexico has some 23,000 secular schools with more than 2,000,000 students getting no religious instruction ; 86% of its primary schools are supported by the Federal or State Governments . All these schools preach " the doctrine of economic interdependence and social service , " various shades of socialism . Children attend them by day , adults by night . There moppets are vaccinated and expectant mothers given medical advice . <P> But in Mexico City remains one Rightist stronghold defiantly independent of the education ministry-the National University . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ students , traditionally conservative , struck again and again until in 1933 they won complete autonomy from the Government , plus a Government endowment of 10,000,000 pesos . The Government regrets every penny of it . When three years ago the university complained its income was inadequate , President Lazaro Cardenas tartly advised it to stop being an enemy of the State . <P> At 2 o'clock one morning last week several hundred young men filed silently into the university buildings , barricaded doors and corridors . By daybreak enraged Rightist students found their university had been taken over by the United Socialist Youth of Mexico . When Rector Chico Goerne arrived in his office , the Socialists marched him out again . The Rightists charged at the doors , clambered up walls , were driven back by revolver shots . The Leftists held the buildings all day . One student lay dead and five injured when Government police finally smashed in , arrested or dispersed the Socialists , recaptured the university for the Government 's foes .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
