Scene : A corner of the living room in the country house of Clifford Vanderstyle , some place on the Hudson . The room is rather heavily handsome . Out-of-date elegance and ornamentation prevail ; but beauty and dignity are also there . See scene design . The present ; five o'clock ; an afternoon in August . At Rise : The room is empty . The LIGHT is that of late afternoon on a dark day . Strong , steady RAIN is heard . After a moment Clifford comes in l. from the hall . Clifford is twenty-six . Tall , thin and fairly good-looking in a priggish way . His voice is oily with satisfied smugness . His clothes are the height of fastidious perfection . He walks importantly toward the windows . Stanley , the magnificent butler , appears from l. in the hall entrance . STANLEY ( In a solemn and correct manner ) Do you wished tea served here , sir ? ( The RAIN is so loud that Clifford does n't hear . Stanley comes further into the room  --  speaking a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? ( Still Clifford does n't hear . Stanley moves closer to Clifford ) I beg pardon , sir ? p. 3 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Turning ) What ? STANLEY ( Still louder ) Do you wish tea here , sir , or in the library ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Here  --  ( Stanley turns Left )  --  and the Van Dusen service . It will be the first time it has been used since my mother 's death , Stanley . STANLEY I understand , sir . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  and see that everyone is told that tea is at five-fifteen . STANLEY Very good , sir . ( Dolores Winthrop comes into the hall entrance from l . Stanley steps aside for her to pass in the hall . Stanley exits l. through the hall . Dolores is twenty-two . Tall , strikingly beautiful , with the young authority of great smartness and distinction . ) WINTHROP I 've been asleep . Is that what everybody else is doing ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Evidently . I have n't seen anybody since luncheon . I 've sent up to ask them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you came down first . I have n't been alone with you a minute since you 've been here , Dolores. p. 4 WINTHROP Have you wanted to be alone with me ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE You know I have . WINTHROP Perfectly easy . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Not so easy when you let Peter hang around you every minute . WINTHROP If Pete can manage it  --  why ca n't you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Lifting his voice as the RAIN is louder ) I beg your pardon . WINTHROP ( Her voice rising in irritation at the noise of the rain ) I say if Pete can  --  why ca n't you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Louder ) I hope you do n't mind the rain . WINTHROP Not a bit  --  only I wish to God it would stop . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Double forte ) You do n't blame me for the rain  --  do you ? WINTHROP ( Going to the window ) No  --  no , Cliffie , but it does get on your nerves . It has n't let up once since we got here last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'm so sorry . I wanted this to be a perfect week end for you . WINTHROP What ? ( RAIN SOFTER . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Going close to her ) I wanted this to be a perfect week end for you . And if the others were n't here  --  WINTHROP Are you sorry you asked them ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Leaning on piano , Right ) Of course not . I asked them for your sake  --  but if they were n't here I do n't think you 'd mind being shut in for one day . You 'd begin to feel as I do about the house . You do like it  --  do n't you , Dolores ? WINTHROP I 'm crazy about it . It 's a marvelous old house  --  of it 's own kind . You 've been so wise , Cliffie , not to try to change it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Change it ? Why should I change it ? WINTHROP Some people would  --  you know . ( Crosses down c. , front of couch . ) CLIFFORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Vanderstyle . Why should I change what it took them four generations to achieve ? The portraits of all the Vanderstyles who have ever lived here are looking down at you  --  Dolores. p. 6 WINTHROP Do they approve of me ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Stepping back two steps ) You belong here . In fact , you look like a Vanderstyle ghost standing there in that gray light . WINTHROP Oh  --  spooky ! Turn on the light  --  please . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Pressing the button which turns on the LIGHTS  --  and looking at Dolores admiringly ) You are an aristocrat , Dolores  --  down to your fingertips . WINTHROP Do n't be stuffy , Cliffie . ( Throwing herself in armchair Right . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE That 's why I ca n't understand why you let Peter think you could  --  ( Crosses down Right to her . ) WINTHROP Cut that out  --  old man  --  if you do n't mind . ( FADE RAIN . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'm not criticizing your friends ,  --  Dolores  --  I would n't presume to do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is your most intimate  --  p. 7 WINTHROP Well , she is . My very most . I adore Betty  --  crazy about her . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But she is n't a bit like you  --  not in any way . WINTHROP That 's why I like her . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I always have a feeling when I 'm with Betty that she 'd cut anybody 's throat to amuse herself  --  if there was n't anything else to do . BETTS ( Coming in l. from hall to back of couch ) Certainly , I would  --  why not ? Do n't let me stop you from ripping me up the back , Cliffie . Keep right on . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Crossing up to back of couch ) I was doing nothing of the kind  --  Betty , I assure you . BETTS And I do n't give a damn whether you were or not , darling . Has n't Billy come yet ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'm sending the car to this next train for him . BETTS How kind of you . Which one are you sending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses Left of Betty ; lighting a cigarette ) Do n't be absurd , Betty . As a matter of fact , I 'm sending the Ford . p. 8 BETTS Why , Cliffie  --  have you got a Ford ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Where are Peter and Tommy  --  are n't they coming down for tea ? BETTS ( Crossing , sitting r. end of couch ) Asleep probably  --  but they 'd wake up for a cocktail . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'm sorry  --  but that 's what I ca n't give you . BETTS Do you mean there actually is nothing in the house ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  yes  --  there 's a cellar full of fine old pre-war stuff  --  and it is n't against the law to use it , of course , but I prefer not to  --  I think it a very vulgar idea . BETTS I ca n't bear it . BREWSTER ( The First Footman , coming into the hall ) A long distance call , sir . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Tell them to hold it . BREWSTER Thank you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANDERSTYLE ( Starts for hall and stops . Turns back to l. of couch ) By the way  --  do n't misunderstand me , Betty , but there are lots of things I wish you would n't say before my sister . This is the first summer I 've let her come home from the convent and while I 'm delighted to have her with you  --  after all , she 's only seventeen and there 's no reason she should be  --  er  --  p. 9 BETTS Contaminated . I 'll try to control myself . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Excuse me just a moment , wo n't you ? ( Exits into hall . ) BETTS ( As he goes out ) Oh , God ! WINTHROP ( Going to sit on couch by Betty ) You 're rotten  --  and you said you would n't be . BETTS But it 's so much worse than I thought it was going to be . I do n't think I can stand it . I think I 'll swim back to town . Has he asked you yet ? WINTHROP No  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . BETTS Are you going to do it ? WINTHROP If it were n't for Peter I 'd marry Cliffie like a shot . BETTS You 're really in love with Petie , are n't you ? WINTHROP Of course . BETTS Tough , is n't it ? The ones we fall in love with never have a dollar  --  and the pills are so apt to have millions . Billy will never have even half a dollar  --  and I am nearer being in love with him than anyone else in my young life . It 's a very difficult thing to do  --  I find , to fall in love . ( Resting head back on cushion. ) p. 10 WINTHROP ( Looking around the room ) I 'm a fool not to grab Clifford quick . It 's real money  --  Bet  --  and what I could do with it ! Think what I could do with this house ! BETTS You could burn it down , for instance . WINTHROP No  --  I 'd like it just for a while in the Autumn . BETTS To watch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slap ) You 're as hard as nails , Betty . You do n't give a hang for anything on earth but just to be amused . BETTS I 'd sell my soul to be amused at the moment . ( Tommy and Peter come in from the hall . ) JONES ( In a whisper as they come in from hall ) How about the liquor  --  what did he say ? ( Dolores gets up quickly and goes to the window . ) BETTS There 's a cellar full  --  but you 're not going to get any . JONES ( Stops l. of couch ) What ? p. 11 BETTS He thinks pre-war stuff is a very vulgar idea . SMEED ( Crossing to l. end of piano ) Oh , I say , Dolores , did n't you get anything out of him ? JONES One of those damned flunkies came and waked me up and invited me down to tea . I thought at least you 'd get a cocktail apiece for us , Dolores . ( Sitting l. end of couch . ) BETTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) WINTHROP ( Going to the piano and playing softly . RAIN starts . ) After all , that 's his own business . SMEED Good business , too  --  saving his booze . JONES No wonder he 's got money . Money  --  money  --  everywhere  --  and not a drop to drink . WINTHROP The next time you 're all stuck in town without the smell of an invitation any place  --  you can just stick there  --  and rot . JONES I 'm not spitting on the party , Dolores  --  but Holy Moses  --  I did n't know it was going to be so wet outside  --  and so dry inside . p. 12 WINTHROP Well , it is . BETTS What 'll we do if it keeps this up tomorrow ? JONES And tomorrow ? SMEED It will . JONES If it does I 'm all set . I 'm going to get a Long Distance that Mother is dying . BETTS I wish I 'd thought of that . WINTHROP ( Stopping the music with a bang . Rises ; crosses to r. end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Pete  --  is what I do not see . SMEED You know damned well why I came . WINTHROP I did n't expect you to for a minute  --  when I asked you . SMEED That 's bunk . Why lie about it ? ( They talk to each other for a moment , their voices rising . ) JONES ( Shouting above them ) You came because you were afraid to leave her alone with Clifford from Friday till Monday  --  did n't you , Petie ? WINTHROP ( In a violent whisper ) Shut up , Tommy . Someone will hear you . p. 13 SMEED ( Lifting his voice ) Not on your life . I would n't be afraid to leave her alone with Cliffe on an island  --  forever . But I am afraid to leave her alone with his plant in action . Cliffie 's priceless possessions , Cliffie 's perfect food  --  and Cliffie 's flawless flunkies . JONES I do n't blame you , Do . I 'm falling , too . WINTHROP Shut up ! JONES Every time I press a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the softness  --  I feel my character slipping . ( Sinking his head in the pillows . RAIN , louder . ) SMEED ( Going to the window ) Gosh  --  look at it ! I ask you ! BETTS When I think of the horse I was going to ride ! JONES When I think of the golf I was going to shoot ! WINTHROP You 're all disgustingly vulgar to be here at all . You only came for what you could get out of it . ( Crosses to back of couch c . ) BETTS ( Crossing around couch r. , throwing herself on couch ) I would n't mind how vulgar I am if there was anything I could get out of it . Anything at all . p. 14 SMEED Nothing we can take home with us . JONES ( With a strong English accent ) Even the English bath soap is heavily marked . BETTS ( Looking about the room ) How would you like one of the little carved treasures from foreign parts in the cabinet over there ? ( Stop RAIN @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to see the little carved things I 've got up in my room ! ( Crosses around front of chair and up to cabinet Upper l. , pushing chair up . ) BETTS Is it Dutch or Spanish or what ? And what period ? SMEED ( Sitting , chair down r . ) It is n't a period  --  it 's a pause  --  a long pause on the Hudson . BETTS My room belongs to the hand-painted fan period . I 'm so afraid I 'll break something I could hardly turn over in bed last night . JONES And speaking further of beds  --  I was on my way to the ancestral couch in my room last night  --  stretching cautiously from one million-dollar prayer-rug to the other  --  ( He takes long , cautious steps to illustrate )  --  holding on to the last drink of my own Scotch  --  ( Holding out a fist )  --  when a bloody rug slipped and I slid and spilled the liquor . I did n't dare take one of the encrusted towels to mop it up  --  so I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They All laugh. ) p. 15 WINTHROP ( Laughing a little with them ) Idiot ! ( l. end of piano . ) BETTS Mr. Bones , if you had money , would you live on the Hudson ? SMEED Answer : No  --  I 'd live on my money  --  and can the Hudson . JONES Exactly how much are Cliffie and Sister Julia supposed to have , anyway , Dolores ? WINTHROP I 'm sure I do not know . SMEED ( Crossing up to window ) You bet your life you know . WINTHROP I do not . SMEED Everybody knows . Seventeen million apiece . JONES Are you there  --  God ? Seventeen million ! Go to it , Dolores ! I could almost marry Sister Julia for that . BETTS I wish there was another member of the family for me . WINTHROP You seem to take it for granted they 'd jump at you . Let me tell you the Vanderstyles are a very  --  ( Crossing down to back of couch. ) p. 16 BETTY , TOMMY AND PETER ( All speaking together quickly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES Their ancestors sailed up the Hudson many years ago . SMEED And Cliffie and Julia are the results . JONES The remains  --  so to speak  --  if you know what I mean . WINTHROP It 's simply foul the way you 're behaving . ( Crossing up back of piano to r . ) BETTS Oh , slush ! You 're just as bored as we are  --  every bit . SMEED She is not . She 's having the time of her life . JONES Walking down the great stairway and everything ! BETTS Every time you make an entrance  --  JONES Every time you sit on a chair  --  BETTS You can see him deciding you are worthy the seventeen . N'est-ce-pas  --  Petie ? WINTHROP You 're disgusting . I hate you . p. 17 SMEED The whole layout is disgusting  --  if you ask me . We have no business to be here at all . BETTS But we are here . What I want to know is  --  how are we going to get through this evening ? I 'd just as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be more people lying around , anyway . WINTHROP You make me sick . This is a marvelous old house  --  of its kind . SMEED So is the morgue ! WINTHROP If Cliffie did n't have such good manners , he 'd turn you all out of the house . ( Going quickly to door Left . ) SMEED He would if he were n't so dumb  --  you mean . WINTHROP I like him  --  you know  --  I like him awfully . If you 're rotten to him you 're rotten to me  --  and if you do n't buck up and behave decently for the rest of the time we 're here  --  if you do one thing to embarrass me  --  I 'll never speak to any of you again as long as I live . I mean it . ( She goes out quickly l . Slams door. ) p. 18 JONES It 's mean to tease her like this . BETTS It 's good for her . She 's lost her sense of humor . The seventeen has killed it . I never dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But she is thinking . SMEED I know damned well she 's going to do it . BETTS ( Rises and crosses to Peter ) Poor old Petie ! If ever a boy was in love with a girl  --  you are with Dolores . And she adores you . SMEED Please . JONES Of course she does , Petie ! BETTS If I were Dolores , I 'd marry Cliffie quick  --  get a few million out of him  --  divorce him and marry you . JONES Good business proposition . A quick turnover . ( Crosses down around ; sits on bench l.c . ) SMEED ( To Betty ) I believe you mean it . BETTS You bet I mean it . Love is a merry little jest and money is n't . SMEED Oh , let up . Everything 's a joke to you , Bet . p. 19 BETTS You 're morbid , darling . You need a drink . JONES You would think of that . BETTS I 'd like several myself . Oh , I 'm so bored ! I 'd rather be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than to spend one more hour with Cliffie . JONES You 're in for forty-eight more with him . BETTS I refuse to let anything on earth bore me as Cliffie does . I 'm going to make him amuse me some way  --  as a reason for his existence . SMEED I defy even you to do that . BETTS Let 's make him explode about something  --  hit the ceiling  --  rip up the whole place  --  anything to bust up that damned oily smugness . JONES I 'm with you  --  but how ? BETTS He cares more about his priceless possessions than anything on earth . Let 's find out what he cares most about in the whole place and hide it . Make him think it 's gone  --  stolen . Make him think one of us stole it  --  really believe it , you know  --  till he accuses somebody . Of course , the divine thing would be to make him suspect Dolores. p. 20 SMEED If you could sell your imagination , you 'd be rich . ( RAIN starts softly . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he considers the most valuable thing in the house  --  and we 'll steal it . JONES You take this stealing act very casually  --  I must say . SMEED In the first place  --  how could we swipe anything ? BETTS Nothing easier . I could pick up anything in this room without even you fellows knowing it , and put it in my pocket and get away with it . JONES Mind you , put it in your own pocket  --  not mine ! BETTS I think it 's a grand idea . Something to do . I 've always wanted to see if I could . If crooks can steal so marvelously with everybody around  --  why ca n't intelligent people do it much more cleverly ? JONES Yes  --  but what if he tells you the  --  ( Looks around the room ; sees large clock in the l . Upper corner )  --  that clock  --  for instance  --  is the most valuable thing in the house ? Whose pocket are you going to put that in ? p. 21 WINTHROP ( Coming in from l @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town tonight . I think I shall ask Cliffie to send you . I simply wo n't stand  --  JONES I would n't leave for anything . I 've got a great idea . I 'm going after Sister Julia . If you take Cliffie , Dolores , why should n't I have Julia ? ( Rises and goes to Dolores . ) BETTS Why should n't Peter have Julia ? That would be much better . JONES Here  --  do n't pass her around like the pickles . How do you advise me to begin , Dolores ? How did you begin with Cliffie ? Something tells me that Sister does not know the facts of life . ( Dolores slaps Tommy 's arm and goes back of the armchair r . ) SMEED I 'm damned sure Cliffie does n't . ( They laugh and stop suddenly as Julia comes in from the hall . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Julia is nineteen and might be pretty if she were not swamped by her clothes , which are hopelessly un-smart . She also has possibilities of charm which are stifled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of these other people with wide-eyed admiration ) Oh  --  it 's still raining , is n't it ? p. 22 SMEED Yes ! I believe it is . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Doing the best she can to be a hostess , sits armchair l . Dolores crosses back of couch to Peter . Betty makes face at Peter ) Brother says he hopes you do n't mind the rain . He says we must do something to have some gay fun this evening . ( Peter chokes ; crosses to window . ) JONES ( After another pause , being the only one who CAN speak ) What did Brother suggest ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE He likes games  --  when it rains . SMEED I knew it ! BETTS Well , cheer up . Billy will be here in a few minutes . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I 'm glad Mr. Tracy 's coming . My brother says he 's very jolly  --  ( They All laugh . ) But he surely is n't any jollier than you are , is he , Mr. Jones ? JONES Would you say I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I ? ( Crossing down , sits on seat l.c. ) p. 23 WINTHROP ( Laughing ) You 're all damn fools ! SMEED I 'll say we are . BETTS ( Rises ; crosses to r. end of piano . Peter up stage . Dolores at window ) All but you , Do . You have a purpose . But why I did it  --  will anybody tell me ? JONES ( To Julia ) They 're discussing a book they 've just read  --  Julia . May I call you Julia ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE I do n't mind  --  but I think Brother would . JONES ( Crossing to l. of couch ) Let 's not ask Brother . And will you call me Tommy ? The intimacy of this shut-in little circle makes one chuck the formalities . Do n't you think ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE I 'm not really formal . JONES What are you ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE Just frightened . JONES Mice and things ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE No  --  people . I 'm not used to them . I never saw any in the convent  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see many now  --  just Clifford . p. 24 JONES I begin to understand why you would be scared to death . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Getting up and going toward Betty , in front of couch ) Tea will be served in fifteen  --  really fourteen minutes . And here . Brother thought it would be cosier to have it here . BETTS Cosier than what ? JONES ( Crossing down , sits on bench l.c . ) Cosier than out under the trees , Betty . Do n't be stupid . BETTS ( Sitting beside Tommy ) Watch your step , young fella . I have been warned not to make my conversation any more sophisticated than I can help . ( Betty and Tommy both talk at once . Julia listens , interested and puzzled . Dolores has gone to the piano again , playing softly . Peter stands by her . Betty and Tommy on bench . Stop RAIN . ) SMEED ( Speaking to Dolores in low tones , but heard above the others ) You are n't going to do it  --  are you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMEED Are you going to marry him ? WINTHROP Do you think I am ? SMEED I never did before . I never thought for a minute you could fall for this  --  but since I 've seen you in it  --  it 's getting you , all right . WINTHROP Oh , snap out of it , Peter . ( Nodding toward the statue ; he takes the statue and spanks it . Clifford comes to hall entrance . Dolores goes on playing . Clifford enters . Julia hears slap Peter gives statue ; turns and sits , scared , c. of couch . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE How beautifully you play  --  Dolores . WINTHROP ( As she stops playing ) Thanks . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE And do n't you think the piano has a rare tone ? JONES As rare as rare can be . ( Peter goes round back of piano to window . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh , Elizabeth , that Long Distance was Billy saying he could n't get here . BETTS What ? I 'll kill him . p. 26 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE He said to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his life that he could n't get here  --  that he knew exactly what it would be like and what he was missing . JONES If you know what he means . ( Tommy and Betty and Peter manage to exchange eloquent glances without being seen by Clifford and Julia . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE Tea is about to come in , Brother . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Yes , I know . Since there is no outside view today  --  ordinarily , on one of our marvelously clear days , we get the sweep of the entire country from here . The Catskills and the Berkshires both stand out . BETTS ( Putting her hand up to her eyes and going toward the window ) And do you also see the Rockies ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE Oh , no . One does n't see the Rockies from here . BETTS Oh , does n't one ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE She 's spoofing you , Julia . Sister is so serious . ( Crossing down to l. of couch c . ) I was going to say , since there is no view today , let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , let us ! Where shall you sit , Dolores ? I think I shall sit here . ( Sits r. end of couch ) Tommy , you go there . Where shall you sit , Petie ? SMEED ( Crossing above piano ) I 'm trying to decide . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Will you sit here , Dolores ? I 'm going to turn the lights on . You 'll get the best effect from here . ( Placing a chair for Dolores . ) WINTHROP ( Terribly bored but trying not to show it ) Thanks . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Just a moment . ( He presses a button which turns on the LIGHT above the tapestry in the hall . ) BETTS Marvelous ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Seventeenth Century ! BETTS No . I mean Dolores . Is n't she wonderful in that chair ? SMEED She makes the chair look so good . JONES Turn your head a little to the left , Dolores . Now does n't she look primitive ? A pale primitive , I mean . p. 28 WINTHROP Oh  --  you go to  --  Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say  --  BETTS How could you , Dolores ? I 'm amazed . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Laughing ) How jolly ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Julia  --  JULIA VANDERSTYLE I like it  --  I like to hear something like that for a change . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Elizabeth  --  I was going to tell you what else Billy said . BETTS Yes  --  what ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE He 's sending someone in his place . BETTS Who  --  why ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Knowing that we were confined to the house by the weather  --  he thought we might like a little indoor diversion . JONES I do n't see why he thought that  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE So he 's sending a young musician  --  composer . JONES And will we have to listen to his compositions ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE He also is a magician. p. 29 BETTS A what ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Does clever tricks  --  an all-'round entertainer . SMEED I 'll bet he tells bedtime stories . ( Stanley enters from hall , followed by Two Footmen , who enter with the tea . It is a stately and important ceremony  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hush as Julia seats herself . The table is placed before her  --  the heavy tray with its silver is put on the table . They all take on Julia 's manner as she serves  --  and treat it as a ritual . The Footmen stand at either side of Julia , ready to serve . ) BETTS ( As Stanley enters , followed by the Footmen ) Oh  --  ( After watching the solemn performance ) I think the hour about the tea-table is the most delightful part of the day . Do n't you , Clifford ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Back of couch ) Yes , I do . I really do . Somehow I always rather look forward to it . JONES ( Seated on bench down l.c . ) Somehow I 'd always rather look backward at it . p. 30 WINTHROP ( Seated in small armchair down r . ) Of course it 's nice . Everybody decent loves tea . SMEED Especially when it 's the end of a perfect day . JONES A perfect rainy day . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I hope it clears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one rainy day in the country is enough , is n't it ? I hope tomorrow is one of our clear days . ( Crossing down to back of couch c . ) JONES Intoxicating ! ( Rises half up ) Do you think there 's any chance of one of those tomorrow ? ( Sits . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I  --  get you , Tommy  --  very good  --  JULIA VANDERSTYLE Miss Winthrop  --  how may I give you your tea ? WINTHROP Awfully strong  --  thanks  --  no sugar and a lot of lemon ! BETTS Do n't ask for too much , Dolores . JULIA VANDERSTYLE There  --  I hope that 's right . ( Having poured tea ) p. 31 WINTHROP Thanks . ( One Footman takes the cup to Dolores  --  the Other follows with plate and napkin , solemnly . The First Man then serves the sandwiches  --  the Other the cake , with overpowering dignity . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE And Miss Betty  --  how may I give you your tea ? BETTS ( With desperate seriousness ) Very , very weak  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  nor cream  --  nor lemon . But I 'm very particular about the color . SMEED Do n't bite the cup , Bet . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE They are rather frail . One of my great great grandmothers brought them over from Holland . JULIA VANDERSTYLE And how may I give you your tea  --  Tommy ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Why , Julia  --  JONES I wo n't have any if you 'll let me off . BETTS Oh , Tommy , it would be experience for you . I bet you do n't know what it tastes like . The reason I 'm so very particular about the color is that if it 's a bit too strong it keeps me awake  --  when I 'm in a gay place  --  and I do dislike lying awake at night . Do n't you , Tommy ? p. 32 JONES It depends entirely on what I 'm lying awake for .  --  Well  --  let it go at that . ( Footman crosses to Tommy with cake dish and then crosses and places it l. , front of couch , and exits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses down round l. of couch ) This reminds me of a very amusing story Sir Donald McDonald told me once when I was shooting with him in Scotland . Sir Donald said  --  BETTS What reminds you ? The rain ? ( Stanley follows Footman off through hall . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Sir Donald said  --  SMEED What were you shooting  --  each other ? JONES ( Clapping hands ) The story , the story ! Let us have the amusing story . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Sir Donald said  --  BETTS But I want to know what reminds him of it . I think it always makes a story so much more spontaneous  --  when we know what reminds somebody . p. 33 WINTHROP Shut up , Betty . Go on  --  Clifford . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Sir Donald said one rainy autumn  --  BETTS Was it raining in Scotland , too ? Well  --  well  --  well  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Sir Donald said  --  " My old golf caddie said  --  " SMEED I thought you were shooting . JONES He was  --  but speaking of golf .

Michael Meer comes into the room from the hall . Michael is also young  --  and not very well dressed  --  a pale , sensitive face , somewhat bitter at times . There is a pause as they stare at him . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh , to be sure . How do you do ? ( Crossing up back to shake hands ) I was waiting for you  --  Billy just telephoned . Let me  --  This is my sister  --  Mr. Meer. p. 34 MEER How do you do ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE I 'm pleased to meet you . SMEED Michael Meer ? ( Michael nods . ) I 've heard Billy speak of you .

( Michael follows Betty across the room at Left , where they stand in front of settee . Tommy comes with sandwiches and cakes . ) Put ' em down , Tommy . Put ' em down and leave us . ( Tommy places cakestand before the settee and goes back to the others , who go on talking in low tones while Betty talks to Michael . Julia goes above sofa , then to piano . Tommy crosses up to Julia . ) This is all you get  --  no real drinks . The food is grand  --  the people are pills . Why did Billy get you here ? Just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No  --  to do me a good turn . BETTS He certainly has put one over on you . MEER Oh , no . You said the food was good . BETTS You mean two days of good food is going to mean something to you ? ( Michael nods . ) Keep on . That 's why we 're all here  --  Mike . MEER Why did you come if you 're so bored ? BETTS I 'm not so bored now . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( To Peter ) I 'm glad you know something about this Meer chap . I hesitated at first  --  when Billy suggested it over the phone  --  taking him in  --  in this intimate way . JONES He 's all right . SMEED Sure he is . Bill knows him well . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Sitting on piano bench ) I 'll make it worth his while  --  coming  --  of course .

They 're in a small room off the library  --  this way . ( Crossing l.c. to library . ) WINTHROP Come on  --  Betty . BETTS Not me . Show me something I 'll appreciate . What 's the most valuable thing there is in the house , Cliffie ? ( Peter touches Tommy to make him listen . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Why do you ask that , Betty ? BETTS I think it 's interesting to know . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE My mother 's pearls , of course . ( Michael starts to play . Clifford coming back into room )  --  which my father collected from all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she 's too young to wear them . p. 37 BETTS Oh  --  let 's see them .

Get them . ( Julia goes out through the hall . ) Does anyone else want to see the First Editions ? JONES I can stand it if I do n't . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Come on , Dolores . ( Clifford follows Dolores out into library l. , closing the door . ) BETTS The pearls  --  the pearls ! It 's perfect ! Let 's steal the pearls . Are n't you crazy about it ? JONES It 's better than talking to Julia  --  anyway . ( Crosses back of couch , then down to sandwiches . ) SMEED Oh  --  come off , Bet  --  we ca n't do it . BETTS Of course we can  --  Anyway , we can try . It 'll be something to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the great pearl robberies that has ever been pearled. p. 38 BETTS Mike , come here . ( Tommy and Betty sit on bench l.c . Tommy l. and Betty r . Michael goes to them ; stands r. and a little up . ) If you do sleight-of-hand stuff  --  you can steal the pearls . MEER Thanks  --  BETTS Well  --  ca n't you ? MEER I suppose I could if I had the nerve . JONES Betty will supply the nerve . BETTS Michael  --  can you pick things off people ? JONES Do n't , Bet . ( Scratching his arm . ) MEER Like this , you mean ? ( Taking beads from Betty 's neck . ) SMEED Gosh  --  That 's fine  --  swell ! BETTS I 'll say you 're good . Now  --  when Julia brings in the pearls I 'll take them first and get Dolores to put them on . It will be funnier if Dolores is the one who has them last . JONES I get you . BETTS And you have to get them off of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 39 MEER ( Holding up the beads ) Like this , you mean ? BETTS ( Putting up hand to throat and finding her pearls are gone ) They 're mine  --  you could n't  --  How could you ? ( Michael places the pearls in her hands . ) You 're marvelous . SMEED ( Crosses down l. of bench ) This is getting good  --  Then what do we do ? BETTS After Mike gets them off of Dolores he gives them to me and I hide ' em . SMEED Where ? BETTS Well  --  where ? JONES In the piano . BETTS They 'd rattle , nit-wit . Under the rug . JONES Get stepped on  --  sap-head . BETTS Think , Pete . SMEED I am thinking  --  but  --  BETTS But what ? SMEED We 'll be monkeying with at least  --  How much would they cost  --  about ? p. 40 JONES Search me . BETTS That 's what Clifford will soon be doing , dearie . SMEED ( Pointing to Betty 's pearls ) How much did yours cost , Bet ? BETTS @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand dollars . JONES ( Falls on Betty 's shoulder ) Ouch ! SMEED Well  --  where are we going to hide them ? BETTS Under this cushion . That 's where I always lose everything . ( Lifting the seat of the armchair l.c . ) Now remember  --  I take them from Julia  --  and give them to Dolores  --  Mike takes them off of her and gives them to me  --  and I slip them under the cushion  --  like that . MEER Are you going through with it ? BETTS Are n't you game ? MEER It 's nothing in my life , but I 'm not so keen about those beads getting out of your hands . SMEED That 's what I say . BETTS But we 'll all be right in the room every minute . p. 41 MEER Do n't take your eyes off that chair after you put the necklace in it . And be sure to  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Opening door Left , coming in Center , front of couch ) Yes  --  very rare . Would you like to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dolores comes in after Clifford , back of bench . ) BETTS Yes  --  by the way  --  where is Julia with the pearls ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE She does n't always remember the combination of her safe . JONES Fancy having a personal safe . I 'd have to put myself in it  --  being my only jewel . BETTS Why do you have one , Clifford  --  the servants ? JONES Or the guests ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE No fear of the servants . Everyone in the house has been here for years and well tested . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Coming back through the hall with jewel case ) I 'm so sorry . I remembered I had n't fed my birds today . Here they are . ( Dolores crosses around front to c . Clifford takes the case and opens it , showing a magnificent string of pearls. ) p. 42 BETTS Oh , my word ! Are they real ? ( Clifford smiles tolerantly and lifts the pearls . ) You 're perfectly safe  --  nobody would ever believe they 're real . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE There 's something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ imitations made and not keep these in the house  --  but I 'm very much opposed to imitations of any kind  --  I think it 's a very vulgar idea . BETTS Let me take them . ( She takes the pearls . When Betty takes the pearls Stanley enters from the hall , crosses slowly to library l. and exits . ) Look  --  Dolores  --  did you ever see anything so marvelous in your life ? The color ! WINTHROP The texture ! JONES The size of ' em ! My eye ! WINTHROP Why do n't you wear them , Julia ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE They 're much too grand for me . You 're the sort who ought to wear them . BETTS Put them on , Dolores . ( Putting the pearls over Dolores ' neck . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  how beautiful she is ! p. 43 WINTHROP I 've got to look . Where 's a mirror ?

Dolores does n't want to play . She 's too busy admiring herself . Come on , Pete  --  you and Tommy  --  and Cliffie and me . ( Peter and Tommy move toward Betty and Clifford at Right . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Going to them ) May I watch ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'll ring for a table . ( Clifford moves away to ring the bell . When his back is turned Betty nods to Michael , who is standing back of Dolores . Michael moves a little nearer to Dolores , but she is fingering the pearls and he ca n't get them. ) p. 44 WINTHROP The texture , the skin  --  MEER Is this your handkerchief , Miss Winthrop ? ( Holding out a handkerchief to Dolores . ) WINTHROP Is it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You 've got a million of mine . ( While Dolores is examining the handkerchief , Michael steps back of her and puts his hands up , ready to unclasp the necklace . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Turning to them quickly ) Oh  --  we ca n't play . ( They All make a decided movement . ) I had no idea it was so late . We 've just about time to dress for dinner . ( As Clifford turned and spoke , Michael took his hands down quickly without getting the pearls . ) WINTHROP ( Going toward Julia and starting to remove the pearls from her neck ) Here they are , Julia . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  you keep them awhile . I love to see you wear them . ( Down Left Michael writes a note . ) WINTHROP I would n't dare . p. 45 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do n't be foolish , Dolores . Wear them this evening . WINTHROP I 'm almost afraid to  --  but they are so marvelous . I wish I had brought my black velvet gown with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let me wear them . ( Walking up l. to hall as if with train ) It really is the most extraordinary sensation . Coming up , Bet ? ( Julia follows her up . RAIN starts softly . ) BETTS Right away . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Hurry , Julia . You 're apt to be late  --  you know . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I usually want to be late . ( Dolores and Julia exit l. in hall . ) ( WARN Curtain . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Going up toward hall ) I 'll show you your room now , Meer  --  if you 'll come along . MEER Thanks  --  very much . ( Michael hesitates , glances at Betty , then he crosses to Clifford . As they go out together Michael puts his hand behind him and tosses a note toward the Others , who are watching him. ) p. 46 BETTS ( In a whisper ) What 's that ? ( Peter dashes and gets the paper ; unfolds it as Betty and Tommy come to him between the couch and bench . ) SMEED ( Reading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after dinner ? " When did he have time to write that ? BETTS Is n't he swell ? JONES He 's too good . He gives me the willies . SMEED Yes  --  but he lost his chance . We ca n't pull it off . You better go and tell Dolores to give those beads back to Julia , quick . BETTS No . It 's going to be much funnier after she 's worn them awhile . I 'm getting just as excited as if we really were going to steal ' em . JONES Well , we are . I 've gone goose-flesh . BETTS When I get up from the table  --  you two come with me . And we 'll decide how we 're to do it . All I know is when I get them  --  I 'll put them under this cushion . ( Stanley enters from library Left , standing in the doorway . Two Footmen enter at same time from hall and cross down back of couch , r. end , to front and start to clear away the tea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be many varieties of wild flowers on the Hudson  --  if you know what I mean ? ( Betty , Peter and Tommy go into the hall . Betty is between the Two Boys , taking an arm of each . They laugh and exit in the hall as the Curtain falls . ) CURTAIN @x Scene : Same as Act I. Two hours later , after dinner . At Rise : It is RAINING softly . The stage is empty . Betty , Peter and Tommy come in from hall . Betty is between the two boys , hanging on to their arms . They are all in evening dress . Betty is laughing . SMEED For Heaven 's sake , pipe down , Bet . If they were n't such dumb-bells , they 'd know something was going on  --  the way you snorted at the table . ( Crosses down r . Peter on the l. , Betty c. and Tommy r. , Peter looking back into hall . ) BETTS I could n't help it . Every time I looked at Dolores  --  high-hatting us in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought he was going to blow up and bust in the soup . SMEED ( Looking off to the hall ) Damned ass . Let 's get some action . Are we going to do it  --  or are we not ? BETTS Certainly we are . SMEED I think your boy friend is boasting . JONES I do n't think anybody can pry the beads off Dolores now . p. 49 BETTS That 's why it 's going to be so funny . See if Mike is coming . ( Peter starts to the entrance as Michael comes in from the hall . She moves down to l. of couch ) What do we do , Mike ? MEER I 'm getting terribly cold feet . BETTS Why ? MEER I 'm afraid I 'll muff it again . It 's not so easy . SMEED You bet it 's not  --  with seven or eight people in the room . BETTS We can try , anyway . What do you want us to do ? ( Sits on couch . Tommy steps to r. of couch . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ close to her . The important thing is for you to attract Clifford 's and his sister 's attention long enough for me to unfasten the clasp . SMEED How long will it take ? MEER One  --  two  --  three  --  four  --  five  --  six . Almost as long as that . Now decide what you 're going to do  --  and all do it at the same time . You 'll have to have a signal of some kind to begin . BETTS I 'll watch you and when you put your hand to your head  --  ( Illustrating )  --  like this , I 'll say , " Oh , it 's still raining , " and we 'll shoot . I 'll make Clifford look at this ring . p. 50 JONES I 'll read a poem to Sister . ( Crosses up to l. of piano ; picks up book . ) SMEED I 'll give Dolores a cigarette and take a long time to light it . MEER Do n't overdo it  --  you know . Be natural . ( He sees the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ raining . ( The door closes . ) BETTS What was it ? MEER ( Still watching the door ) Somebody opened the door . SMEED Who ? MEER I think  --  it was the head guy . He sees things . JONES My God ! I see myself in jail now . BETTS Keep still ! Go on , Mike  --  ( She stops as Julia comes in from hall . ) JONES ( Crosses l. ; meets Julia ) You 're looking very snappy this evening . ( Michael , Betty and Peter cross down r . Ad lib. with " Yes  --  yes , " etc . ) If you know what I mean . p. 51 JULIA VANDERSTYLE I 'm afraid I do . JONES What ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE At least I know you do n't think I 'm snappy . ( Clifford and Dolores come in the hall . ) Brother would n't let me be . I wish I were  --  WINTHROP ( Up l. in hall ) I simply adore them . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Turns and sees Dolores in hall ) Is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you wear them ? ( Betty , Peter , Michael pantomime down r . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE Brother wo n't let me . BETTS Oh  --  is it still raining ? ( Crossing to l . Michael runs his hand over his hair . ) Oh , did you ever see this little old ring  --  Cliffie ? It 's my one possession . JONES Have you read this little poem , Julia ? It reminds me of you . ( Tommy gets the book from the piano and reads ) " Lilies are white , Lilies are pure . But the bluebells Are the sweetest of all . " p. 52 SMEED ( To Dolores ) Want a " Lucky " ? WINTHROP Thanks . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What is it ? BETTS Look inside . SMEED I have to hand it to you . You look great in ' em . ( Michael is moving toward Dolores . Stanley enters from the hall ; looks at Clifford . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Stanley  --  we 'll have coffee in the gallery . ( Stanley goes out . ) WINTHROP ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sake , what 's the matter ? Does n't it work ? SMEED Not very well . It 's the one you gave me . ( Tommy , still pretending to look out the window with Julia , watches Michael , who is back of Dolores , and signals to Peter to keep on bluffing with the lighter . ) WINTHROP Give it to me . ( She takes the lighter , flashes it and lights her cigarette ) Perfectly all right . ( Michael has lifted his hands , about to take the pearls ) Will you play , Michael  --  so we can dance ? p. 53 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Giving the ring back to Betty ) Your ring 's only a copy , Betty . Do play  --  Meer  --  so we can dance . Do n't you think a softer light would be nice ? ( He turns the chandelier LIGHTS OFF . Michael plays . Betty makes Clifford dance with her . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( To Tommy ) Oh ! I did n't know Brother was romantic . WINTHROP ( To Peter as they dance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was nasty this afternoon . SMEED You were n't . I was . I wish we were out of this cussed place  --  alone somewhere . ( He kisses her . ) WINTHROP Careful ! ( RAIN stops . ) SMEED I 'm crazy about you . WINTHROP You 're sweet . SMEED Take those damned things off your neck . WINTHROP Do n't be silly . SMEED You could n't marry him  --  could you ? p. 54 WINTHROP It 's what I ought to do and you know it . If it were n't for you  --  I would . ( He kisses her again . ) BETTS ( To Clifford ) How beautifully you dance  --  Cliffie ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  thank you . I do think I have rhythm . ( Dance down c. , then l. and back . ) BETTS Yes  --  and you have a lot of other things , too . JONES ( To Julia ) You may think I 'm the May pole  --  but this is not a May pole dance . JULIA VANDERSTYLE That is n't what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE I think you 're very jolly . JONES You burn me up . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( To Betty , as she laughs ) I 'm glad to see you in such good spirits , Betty . I was afraid the rain might make it a little dull for you . p. 55 BETTS I like it . It makes you dig up things to amuse yourself . ( Clifford leaves Betty and takes Dolores away from Peter . ) I beg your pardon ! Just like that ! SMEED ( Dancing with Betty , crossing to c . ) I guess it 's me for you . We ca n't pull this thing off , Bet . It would take damned good crooks to get those pearls right under Clifford 's nose . BETTS It 's some nose  --  but I know a grand way to do it  --  as soon as we stop dancing . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( To Dolores as they dance ) You 're more beautiful than ever . WINTHROP It 's the pearls . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE They do bring you out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't mind telling you I like wearing them . Very Ritzie feeling . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'd like to give you some just like them . WINTHROP Oh  --  Cliffie , how marvelous ! ( All ad lib. softly ) p. 56 JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( To Tommy ) Oh , dear ! Do you like to ride ? JONES I 'm good on a camel . BETTS But do n't you think horses are wonderful ? JONES Elephants are nice , too . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I know I 'm not saying the right things  --  but I think when I get my money everything I say will sound better . JONES You sound all right to me  --  now . SMEED ( To Betty ) Can you hear what he 's saying to her ? BETTS No  --  but look at him ! Is n't he the young gazelle ? JONES ( Taking Julia to Peter and Betty ) I do n't want to be selfish . I 'll let you cut in  --  Peter . ( Tommy hands Julia over to Peter and dances with Betty . To Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'm going to keep it . I 've earned the pearls . BETTS Look . I think he 's proposing to her now . ( Tommy and Betty bend back , as Apache dancers. ) p. 57 JONES That 's why he turned off the lights , so he could let himself go  --  with passion . In the meantime , how about the great pearl robbery ? Night is coming on , my girl . Crooks do n't make their living as easily as I thought they did . BETTS I know a grand way to do it . We 'll make Dolores play something . Get her at the piano so Mike can stand back of her . Let 's tell Mike now . ( Betty and Tommy start to the piano as Peter brings Julia back to Tommy . ) SMEED Many thanks . JULIA VANDERSTYLE You think I ca n't dance . But I could . JONES Then why do n't you ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE It 's Brother . He does something to my spine . JONES He seems to have done something to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ piano , where they talk to Michael . Tommy and Julia stand still , talking . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( At Left , still dancing with Dolores ) I have grown to be very fond of you , Dolores  --  and I think you 're fond of me  --  in the right way . p. 58 WINTHROP Yes  --  Clifford  --  but I  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I mean I think the most successful marriages are made of affection  --  rather than passion . I do n't think you would disappoint me . I think you would live up to it all more than any girl I 've ever known . I 'm asking you to marry me , Dolores . WINTHROP Oh  --  Clifford ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do n't thank me . We 'll be alone  --  later . We 're going to look at the pictures now . Julia ! ( Tommy whirls Julia around several times . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( As she laughs ) We 're going to have coffee in the Art Gallery . JONES And where is the Art Gallery ? BETTS Where they keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out l . Betty stops Peter and Tommy at the door . Michael waits at the door . ) Mike , we 'll get in back of them as soon as they have their coffee . I 'll ask you to play " Star Dust . " MEER And I 'll say I do n't know it . p. 59 BETTS Then I 'll say  --  you play it , Dolores . She plays it all the time , you know . And when she sits down  --  MEER I 'll get in back of her  --  JONES Great ! BETTS Do n't you want some coffee , Mike ? MEER No , thanks . ( Betty goes out l. , closing the door . Michael goes to table r. ; takes up box . Stanley enters from l. ; crosses up to hall entrance , watching Michael ; turns on LIGHTS and exits . ) BETTS ( Coming back from library l . ) As soon as they come back here  --  What 's the matter ? MEER Nothing . What were you going to say ? BETTS As soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be funny ? MEER Not as funny as you do . BETTS Anything wrong ? MEER Not a thing  --  only I wish I had n't come . BETTS Thank Heaven you did . I 'm just beginning to have a good time . ( Sits on couch. ) p. 60 MEER I 'm going to be paid for amusing you  --  you know . BETTS ( After a pause ) Well  --  that need n't make you hate us . Does it ? MEER You 've been terribly nice to me . BETTS I have n't been nice . I like you . Money 's terrible  --  is n't it ? I mean not to have it . ( Rises ; gives cup to Michael . ) MEER It 's terrible to be with it . When you have n't got it . I do n't mind when I 'm alone . ( Puts cup on piano . ) BETTS I know . I know . ( Sits on l. of piano bench . ) MEER Oh  --  no , you do n't . BETTS Do you mean it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEER I want to write good music . Money could n't make me do that . BETTS But do n't you want money , too ? MEER Just enough to keep going . It 's an awful bore to have to stop and make enough to go on working . That 's why Bill suggested this . It will be quick money . p. 61 BETTS Julia would be quick money . ( They both giggle ) Now that you 're here , why do n't you get her ? MEER Ca n't be done . BETTS Easy . MEER I mean  --  a girl you 're not in love with . BETTS ( After a pause ) You mean love would be romantic stuff for you ? Have to have one girl  --  in particular ? Nobody else would do ? That sort of stuff . MEER ( Looking at Betty ) Would n't it be  --  that way  --  for you ? BETTS I 'm too hard-boiled to let it happen to me . MEER Oh  --  but you 're not . BETTS Oh , but I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got to be . I know just as well as you do  --  what it means  --  not to have money . MEER ( Gaily ) But you could n't . I pay five dollars a week for my room . p. 62 BETTS Yes  --  but you pay it . ( Both laugh . ) That 's more than Mother and I usually do . Where the next month 's rent is coming from I do n't know . MEER Do you mean it ? BETTS Mean it ? Nobody ever believes it . That 's the joke . We put up such a good bluff . Mother 's clever as the devil  --  only she was clever once too often in the Market last year . We 're both awfully lucky at cards  --  and we play for some terribly high stakes  --  and we do all sorts of things  --  and  --  well  --  we keep going  --  somehow .

If you once lose your nerve  --  ( Her voice breaks . ) MEER I 'm most awfully sorry . ( Crosses to l. of couch . ) BETTS ( Facing l . ) But I 've cared more than I ever have in my life since I 've been in this beastly house . It makes me awfully rebellious , somehow , that these people should have so much and I  --  less than nothing . And you  --  Oh , God  --  why should you have to worry about money when you have something so much more important to do ? p. 63 MEER ( Steps toward Betty ) Do you think it 's more important  --  really ? BETTS Of course it 's more important  --  because it 's more beautiful . MEER I 'm glad you  --  think that . BETTS ( Crosses r. to table ) Does n't this stuff make you sick ? This damn fool little box  --  plastered with jewels  --  and used for cigarettes . ( She picks up the box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two sonatas and a fugue . Could n't you ? ( They laugh . ) How good are you , anyway ? MEER I do n't know . BETTS Do n't be so modest . What do people say about your stuff ? MEER Gershwin says some of it is n't so bad . BETTS Swell ! What was the last thing you played for us to dance ? MEER Like it ? BETTS A lot . MEER ( Sits on the piano bench and plays ) I watched you dance  --  and made it up . p. 64 BETTS ( Sitting on the piano bench ) Did you make up words , too ? MEER I could .

Michael begins to play good jazz . The Others come in l. , going to the piano and beginning to sing . Clifford and Julia come in last . Julia gets into the spirit and shakes to rhythm . Clifford taps her on shoulder . She sits on bench l.c . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Standing in front of Julia as she sits at l . ) It 's quite all right , Julia . That 's the way all young people behave nowadays . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I love it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Why , Julia ! I 've always said there was something quite barbaric in you . ( Looking complacently at the others ) It 's wonderful for them to be here . p. 65 JULIA VANDERSTYLE Do they think so ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I do n't know what you mean . JULIA VANDERSTYLE You do n't know what they mean  --  either  --  do you ? Especially when they say  --  " If you know what I mean . " CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I understand them perfectly . I asked them for Dolores @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speaks my language au fond . I 've asked her to marry me  --  Julia . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Oh ! But she wo n't  --  will she ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE You 're stupid . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Yes , I know I am  --  but  --  at least I know I am  --  if you know what I mean . BETTS Yes  --  it 's still raining . Play " Star Dust , " Michael . MEER Do n't know it . BETTS Oh  --  no , you play it , Dolores . WINTHROP I 've got a nerve playing for you . ( She sits and plays the song . Michael stands back of her . ) BETTS ( Going to Clifford with the cigarette box which she had previously picked up ) Cliffie , what is this little box ? It 's so curious . Where did it come from ? p. 66 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Opening the box ) There 's a long , interesting story attached to this  --  ( He goes on talking . ) SMEED ( Killing a mosquito on his hand ) Gosh ! Mosquitoes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swat one on your back . WINTHROP Do n't you dare . ( There is a little skirmish as Peter slaps her shoulder . Michael gets the pearls , slips them in his pocket , moving as Dolores gets up . ) I 'd rather be bitten than beaten to death . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I may give it to the Metropolitan Museum . WINTHROP What ? ( Going to Clifford . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE This little box . It 's Egyptian and very rare . WINTHROP Let 's see it . ( She goes to Clifford , who gives her the box . ) BETTS ( Going to Michael and Peter , who are l. , near the armchair . Michael slips her the pearls . ) Imagine having a thing lying around loose that may have been Cleopatra 's powder box . ( Sitting in chair and placing pearls under cushion . Peter and Michael stand in front of her from the others . ) Move , you fellas  --  p. 67 SMEED Sorry  --  BETTS ( Still sitting in the chair ) What are we going to do now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let 's play adjectives  --  so we can act . JONES Oh  --  why not drop the handkerchief ? Would n't you like that , Julia ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE I like this better . BETTS You first , Dolores . WINTHROP I wo n't  --  I hate it . BETTS Give her a word to act , Tommy , and we 'll all guess  --  terrified . WINTHROP Oh , you know I ca n't  --  it makes me feel such a fool . SMEED We do n't expect you to be Kit Cornell , you know . BETTS Go on , Dolores  --  Everybody guess the word she acts . WINTHROP I do n't know how . BETTS Act  --  act ! WINTHROP But  --  how ? ( She throws out her arms and then puts her hands to her throat ; thinks of the pearls ; feels for them and gasps ) Where are the pearls ? p. 68 BETTS You 're grand , Dolores . WINTHROP But where are they ? ( RAIN stops . ) JONES You 're great ! WINTHROP I mean it . Where are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What do you mean , Dolores ? WINTHROP The pearls . They 're gone . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE They ca n't be . They slipped down your dress . WINTHROP ( Looking down her dress , shaking her clothes ) But they have n't . They could n't . JONES Are you acting or not ? WINTHROP Of course I 'm not . Where are they ? BETTS She 's stringing us . WINTHROP I 'm not . Look for them  --  everybody . I had them two minutes ago . Did n't I ? Did n't everybody see them ? Look  --  look ! Be careful ! Do n't step on them ! ( They All begin to look frantically , stepping about cautiously , not speaking . Suddenly they All talk at once. ) p. 69 BETTS ( She goes to Dolores ) They must be on you , Dolores . ( Looking inside Dolores ' dress , both front and back . ) WINTHROP But they 're not . I 'd feel them . And the clasp was strong . Was n't it , Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think it was very strong . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE It 's very strange . BETTS Have you had them since you were in there ? WINTHROP Oh  --  maybe they fell off in there . Come and look . Come and look . ( She runs into the room at l . Clifford and Julia follow . ) JONES That 's great . SMEED This is enough now . You ca n't do this to Dolores . ( Turning at the door ) If you do n't tell her as soon as she comes back here  --  I will . BETTS Oh , be a sport , Pete ! It 's grand . JONES Come on , Pete  --  watch Cliffie get suspicious . ( Tommy pulls Peter into the other room. ) p. 70 BETTS It 's even better than I thought it would be . MEER It 's too good . It makes me sort of sick to see her so frightened . ( Michael is near the chair l.c . While Betty 's back is turned to him he runs his left hand under the cushion and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) BETTS I 'll tell her as soon as Clifford does something to really queer himself with her . MEER He 'll suspect me  --  in a minute . I 'm the obvious one . BETTS We 're all suspicious characters to Clifford . MEER Do n't keep it up too long , will you ? WINTHROP ( Hurrying back into the room ) I 'm getting frightened . What shall I do , Betty ? ( The Others come in after her . ) BETTS ( Turning up a rug ) Did you look under all the rugs in there ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE They could n't be under a rug  --  unless someone put them there . JONES Well , if they just fell off  --  where are they ? p. 71 BETTS Are you sure you had them on since dinner , Dolores ? WINTHROP I think I did . I do n't know . Did I have them on at dinner ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE Oh , yes , you did . I remember thinking how much more appropriate they were for you than for me . JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls vibrating . ( Betty laughs . ) WINTHROP Stop laughing  --  Betty ! It 's not funny , you know . What shall I do ? ( She begins to cry . ) BETTS They 've got to be in this room . JONES Sure thing . Pearls do n't walk out . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Growing colder and more suspicious every time he speaks ) It 's very strange . WINTHROP It 's horrible ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE And it 's very serious . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Why is it ? There 's no one in the room but your friends . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE That 's why it is so serious , Julia . You 're so naive , you do n't understand . p. 72 JULIA VANDERSTYLE They 're my pearls  --  and if I do n't mind  --  I do n't see why anyone else should . ( Rises and crosses to l. door . ) JONES That 's very handsome of you , Julia , I must say . WINTHROP Cliffie  --  I do n't know what to do  --  I do n't know what to say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my  --  ( Her voice breaks . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Please do n't take it that way , Dolores . I 'm trying to think  --  what to do . BETTS There 's only one thing to do . JONES What ? BETTS Have us searched . JONES Good idea . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Wait ! You had them on at the piano , Dolores . WINTHROP Yes , I did . ( Peter turns away , angry . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE And Meer was standing back of you . WINTHROP Yes  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Going up to l. of piano ) I have it ! It 's one of your tricks  --  is n't it , Meer ? You took them off to frighten us . Did n't you ? ( Stanley comes into the hall . No One sees him. ) p. 73 WINTHROP Did you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Very clever , Meer . Very clever , indeed . Now show us how you did it . That 's always the best part . WINTHROP How dare you do such a thing to me  --  how dare you ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funny , you know . Give them to me , I say . MEER I have n't got them . WINTHROP You have . MEER I 'm sorry . I have n't . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Careful now  --  Meer . There was some sort of skirmish at the piano . WINTHROP About the mosquito . You took them then . Give them to me . MEER But I have n't  --  ( Sees Stanley in the hall )  --  got them . WINTHROP You 're lying . BETTS Do n't , Dolores . WINTHROP He 's lying , Cliffie . BETTS Stop it . He has n't got them  --  I have . I did it . JONES Me , too . p. 74 SMEED We all did it . BETTS When Mike got them from Dolores  --  he gave them to me and I put them under this cushion like this  --  ( Betty starts toward the chair l.c . ALL THE LIGHTS GO OUT . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Who did that ? Who put out those lights ? Stand still . ( Michael moves l . ) SMEED The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where are you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do n't move till I see if I can turn them on . Wait  --  and be quiet . SMEED Stand still  --  everybody . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Goes into the hall ) Who 's that ? Who 's in this hall ? ( He puts on the LIGHTS ) Somebody turned off the lights . Who did it ? It was n't the storm . ( Crosses down l. of couch . Betty sits . A pause . ) SMEED No one moved . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But I touched someone out there . ( To Michael ) Meer  --  you were n't standing there  --  when the lights went out . p. 75 MEER No , I was n't . I got out there before you did . I thought I saw someone come into the hall a minute ago . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Who ? MEER I could n't tell . I only saw a sort of shadow . I 'm not even sure that it was anybody  --  but I jumped quick to find out . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Why should you do that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw somebody ? Did you knock against anyone in the dark , Mike ? MEER No . SMEED I thought maybe you and Cliff ran into each other . MEER I did n't touch anyone . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I did . MEER Not me ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Very extraordinary ! JULIA VANDERSTYLE I know who it might be . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Who ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE You know , too ,  --  Brother  --  but you wo n't admit it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What do you mean , Julia ? p. 76 JULIA VANDERSTYLE Grandmother Van Dusen . ( Sits ) She always said the house was haunted and she always said she 'd come back herself  --  if anything wrong was going on here . ( They All laugh . ) BETTS No  --  she did n't take the pearls . I did . I put them in this cushion  --  Look  --  ( She lifts the cushion ; stares at the chair ; runs her hands around the seat ) Somebody 's fooling me . Who took them ? ( They All go to the chair , except Michael . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you do it , Tommy ? JONES So help me God , I did n't . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What do you mean , Elizabeth ? Where are the pearls ? BETTS ( Looking at Michael and trying to smile ) Oh  --  you took them out again to frighten me  --  because you thought I ought n't to frighten Dolores . ( A pause . They All stare at Michael . ) MEER No  --  I did n't . I 'm sorry  --  but I have n't got them . p. 77 BETTS But where are they ? JONES Maybe there 's a hole in the chair . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE No , there is not . It 's very strange that the lights went off just then . Just before you were going to show us where they were . SMEED But no one in this room went out there to turn them off . You know that . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Yes  --  but that was n't necessary . There 's a switch  --  ( Betty sits on armchair )  --  right there under the table  --  which controls every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANDERSTYLE That one  --  back of the sofa  --  where Meer was standing . MEER Oh ! You think I turned the  --  WINTHROP No , he does n't . You did n't mean that , Cliffe . Did you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE If you were in my place , Dolores  --  I think you 'd feel just as I do . I 'm trying to find the necklace . You did take it off of Dolores , then  --  did you , Meer ? MEER Yes . p. 78 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( To Tommy ) Tommy , did you see Meer give them to Betty ? JONES A  --  no  --  I did n't exactly see it  --  but  --  ( Crossing down . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Did you , Peter ? SMEED Well  --  I did n't actually see it  --  but I know when he did it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE And Tommy  --  did you see Betty put them in the chair ? JONES ( With sudden dignity ) What do you mean  --  Cliff ? SMEED ( Threateningly ) She told you she put them there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lying ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I 'm trying to help you find the pearls  --  Elizabeth . WINTHROP I hope you think it 's funny now . But what in the name of heaven did you do it for  --  Betty ? BETTS To amuse myself . They 've got to be in this chair . ( She goes at it again ; lifts cushion. ) p. 79 SMEED Wait  --  have any of the other servants been in here since we did it ? BETTS I do n't know . WINTHROP I do n't know . BETTS No  --  but Stanley was here before I hid them . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses r. to armchair ) I wish he had been here all the time . BETTS What ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE If he had been this would n't have happened . SMEED Why ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses front of Right armchair ) You may as well know that Stanley is a confidential man in my employ  --  a very able one . ( Betty crosses to l. end of couch . They All stare at Clifford . ) The house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of thing there is in it  --  we could n't live here without some protection of that sort . I 'll speak to him now . BETTS ( Rises ; crosses to Clifford ) Why ?  --  What for ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE He must know about this . p. 80 BETTS But they 're right here in this room . Let 's find them . JONES Yes  --  why tell him ? Let 's look . We 'll find them . SMEED I know how you feel , Cliffie . It looks damned queer  --  and we were damned fools to do it  --  but they are in this room . That 's exactly the way it was  --  just as we told you . Now , for Heaven 's sake , let 's find them . BETTS Rip up that cushion . WINTHROP Yes  --  do . ( Betty , Dolores and Tommy look in the chair l.c . ) MEER I insist that you search me , Vanderstyle  --  right here  --  now . BETTS Ridiculous ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I would be very sorry to have to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insist . SMEED It 's the thing to do . BETTS No . JONES Certainly it is . Search me . SMEED Search all of us. p. 81 JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses front to bench l.c . ) Oh , no , Brother ! After all , what difference does it make if they are gone ? We 've lost other things . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE You have no sense at all  --  Julia . We 've never lost anything of anything like this value  --  and nothing at all since Stanley 's been here . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Speaking with Clifford ) I do too have sense . We lost that pin that belonged to Grand-mother Van Dusen . SMEED Send for him . This is absurd  --  but it 's serious . Send for him . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Recovering his dignity ) I do n't know what else I can do . I beg you wo n't misunderstand me . As I said , if Stanley had been in the room all the time this would n't have happened . He can help us now . He 'll find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much more fun to find them ourselves . That 's what they did it for  --  to amuse themselves , Brother . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do n't be childish , Julia . It needs someone cleverer than we are to find them . ( He rings the bell. ) p. 82 JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Crosses to couch ; sits l. of it ) I think that 's awful . SMEED ( Crosses down r.c. between piano and couch ) Oh , no . We 'll all be more comfortable  --  after we 've been searched . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Stanley wo n't go at it that way , of course . But he 'll do something . BETTS It 's a cute way to spend a rainy evening . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I think you were awfully clever to think of it . BETTS So do I. I give myself good . JONES ( Crosses down back of bench l.c . ) Yes  --  after all , why not ? It 's a novelty . WINTHROP Yes  --  is n't it ? I do n't remember ever being searched for stealing before . SMEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the most obvious place . Gosh ! THE OTHERS What ? SMEED We did n't move that chair . ( He goes quickly to the armchair l.c. and pulls it aside . They All stare at the carpet . ) No . ( Stanley comes in from the hall and stands in the entrance , waiting. ) p. 83 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( After a pause ) Is  --  a  --  anyone else about  --  in the hall  --  Stanley ? STANLEY ( Looking back ) No one  --  sir . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Have any of the servants been in this room since dinner ? STANLEY No , sir . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Come in . Stanley , the pearl necklace is lost for the moment . ( Stanley comes into the room . ) We were amusing ourselves . Mr. Meer does tricks  --  sleight-of-hand  --  that sort of thing  --  and they thought it would be funny to  --  BETTS I thought of it . ( Crossing up between Stanley and Clifford . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Going on steadily ) They thought it would be funny to take my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winthrop was at the piano and Mr. Meer was standing  --  BETTS Mr. Vanderstyle did n't see . I was making him look at a little  --  JONES ( Speaking with Betty ) And I was making Miss Vanderstyle look out the  --  ( They All begin to talk at once. ) p. 84 STANLEY Just a moment . One at a time . ( He nods to Peter ) You  --  SMEED I pretended to swat a mosquito on Miss Winthrop 's neck  --  MEER I got the necklace off then and went over there . Slipped them to Miss Betts and  --  BETTS Then I sat in this chair and put them under this cushion  --  like that  --  and a few minutes after  --  ( A pause . They All look at Stanley . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE And then in some very mysterious way the lights went out . STANLEY All the lights ? BETTS Then a little while later  --  SMEED Miss Betts found they were n't there . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What do you make of it , Stanley ? STANLEY Are you playing a parlor trick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We ca n't find the pearls and it 's no joke . JONES We 've looked everywhere but on ourselves  --  and we want you to do that . p. 85 STANLEY Am I to search your guests to amuse them , sir ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do something , Stanley . You seem to be amused , too . STANLEY It 's simple enough . You say no one but yourselves has been here . The pearls were put in that chair  --  and they are n't there now . Either someone is still playing a joke  --  or  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Or what ? STANLEY Or the pearls have been stolen . SMEED That 's impossible . ( There is a pause . They All lower their eyes in embarrassment , except Michael , who watches Stanley . ) STANLEY ( Crossing down c . ) Which line do you want me to work on , sir ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I ca n't conceive that anyone of my guests could be contemptible enough to carry this any further as a joke . It was unpleasant enough to begin with . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened . Help us . TOMMY AND PETER You 'll have to search us. p. 86 MEER Begin with me . ( Crosses front of couch , l. to r. of Stanley . ) STANLEY ( Dropping his suave manner and becoming very hard ) Just a moment . Was anyone in this room  --  alone  --  after the pearls were taken from Miss Winthrop ? BETTS No . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But Miss Betts and Mr. Meer were here together  --  alone  --  for about two minutes . BETTS Oh  --  yes , I forgot . STANLEY Did either one of you touch that chair then ? BETTS No  --  neither of us . STANLEY ( To Michael ) What do you say ? MEER I do n't think she did . STANLEY Did you ? MEER No  --  STANLEY ( To Betty ) Did you turn your back to him while you were here  --  alone  --  together ? BETTS A  --  I do n't remember . p. 87 STANLEY You did , then . BETTS But just for a second . STANLEY Where was he standing  --  when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ By the  --  chair . But he could n't  --  MEER Oh , yes , I could . I could have taken them out of the chair as quickly as I took them off of Miss Winthrop . BETTS ( Looking deeply at Michael ) But you did n't  --  did you ? MEER No . ( To Stanley ) Go on  --  search me . STANLEY You do n't think I 'm fool enough to think they 're on you now  --  if you did take them ? This is quite useless  --  Mr. Vanderstyle . Whoever took the pearls could have put them a dozen places by this time . What do you want me to do ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( With a cold anger which he tries to control but which is rising rapidly ) You 'll have to proceed exactly as if we were not  --  ( Crossing back to piano )  --  a  --  ladies and gentlemen . p. 88 WINTHROP ( Dropping her head ) What would you do  --  under ordinary circumstances  --  if you were called in on  --  a  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) I would tell you to lock the door in that room  --  leading into the hall  --  and Miss Vanderstyle to lock the one in this passage leading into the hall  --  and give the keys to me . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Go on , Julia . Do it . ( Julia hesitates and goes into the hall . Clifford goes into the room l . There is a tense pause . Then they look guiltily at each other and start to move away . ) STANLEY Just stand still  --  if you please . I want to question each one of you separately  --  in that room . Sit down  --  all of you  --  on the nearest seat . ( They all sit cautiously . Julia comes back from the hall , giving a key to Stanley , then Clifford . Stanley , taking the key ) I 'll take you first  --  Miss  --  ( Nodding to Betty . ) BETTS Alone ? p. 89 STANLEY If you please . BETTS ( Standing up and starting to l. door ) Ca n't Peter come with me ? SMEED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . ( Peter sits . ) Go in  --  Miss  --  SMEED It 's only a form he has to go through , Betty . BETTS ( Going on toward the door without turning ) But why me  --  first ? ( Suddenly turning to Stanley ) Do you think I took them ? SMEED Or any of us ? ( RAIN starts . Peter , Tommy and Dolores all stand up . ) JONES Do you ? STANLEY Sit down . ( Dolores sits ; then Tommy ; then Peter . To Clifford ) See that they stay exactly where they are while I am out of the room . I 'll leave this with you . ( Putting a small pistol in Clifford 's hand. ) p. 90 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But if anyone moves , do you expect me to shoot ? ( They laugh . ) STANLEY Quiet ! Yes  --  I do !  --  If you want your pearls back . To put it plainly  --  I expect you to treat these people exactly as you would any thief you found in your house . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or whether they 're all in it together . WINTHROP Clifford ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh  --  er  --  Stanley  --  STANLEY I do n't want any juggling of the pearls  --  or slipping them around from place to place . It 's up to you to keep these people exactly where they are  --  till I come back . ( To the others ) I do n't think you know how big a thing you 're monkeying with . That necklace is worth a quarter of a million dollars . ( There is a gasp from all of them . The CHANDELIER LIGHTS go out , leaving only a dim glow in the room . ) WINTHROP Who put the lights out this time ? STANLEY The storm  --  the storm ! ( To Betty ) Go in , Miss . ( Betty starts Left . As she opens the door there is a blinding flash of LIGHT which strikes her full in the face , then goes out . Betty draws back with a gasp. ) p. 91 BETTS There 's someone in that room . STANLEY Oh , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( To Clifford ) Brother  --  it 's a Van Dusen ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh , Julia !  --  how could you  --  the room is empty . JULIA VANDERSTYLE All right  --  you go in and see . ( Clifford grasps his gun firmly and starts for the door Left . As he reaches the door the same flash of LIGHT strikes him . Clifford fires his revolver into the room . The LIGHT goes out . Clifford drops his gun . Stanley goes to him and picks up the gun . ) STANLEY Do n't lose your nerve , Mr. Vanderstyle . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE All right  --  you go in , Stanley . ( As Stanley starts for the door the flash of LIGHT now appears on the window r. , moving up and down the window until the Curtain falls . The Girls all scream as they see the light . ) WINTHROP It 's on the other side now . STANLEY It 's only the flashlight of one of the watchmen . There are two outside all night . p. 92 JONES ( Sinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought Grandma was trying to get in the window . ( Stanley motions to Betty to go into the room Left . As she starts for the door the Curtain falls . ) CURTAIN @x Scene : The same room . About half an hour after Act II . At Rise : They are all sitting in the same chairs as at the Curtain in Act II , with the exception of Tommy , who is out of the room , and Betty is now in his place . They show that they are tired from sitting ; angry and disgusted , but realizing the seriousness of their situation . RAIN is falling . BETTS ( After a pause , seated in armchair r . ) You 're next , Mike . He 's had everybody but you now . MEER ( Seated on piano bench ) I do n't see why he 's kept me for the last . I know he thinks I 'm it . WINTHROP No , he does n't . He went at me just exactly as if he thought I had done it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't see why you have such a man in the house  --  Cliffie . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE He is n't here to be charming  --  you know . He feels the responsibility of taking care of the place as much as if it belonged to him . SMEED He acts as if it belonged to him , too . p. 94 WINTHROP One half hour he 's had us locked up here in these two rooms  --  grilling us  --  as if we were thieves . If he 's so good , Cliffie , why has n't he found out by this time where the pearls are ? SMEED He 's got a tough job ahead of him  --  if you ask me . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh , I think he knows by this time . WINTHROP What ? Then why does n't he put handcuffs on us and be done with it ? SMEED He probably will before the evening 's over . It 's only half-past nine now . BETTS He 's got the hardest look in his eyes I ever saw . He wants it to be one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What do you mean , Julia ? ( RAIN , loud . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE He 's got to catch somebody and who else is there to catch ? ( They laugh a little . ) WINTHROP ( Seated on couch ) I shall simply die if I do n't have a cigarette . Ca n't I even get my bag , Cliffe ? ( RAIN , soft. ) p. 95 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Seated in armchair l. , holding gun ) I 'm sorry . Not to move  --  or touch anything till he comes back  --  his instructions were . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I do n't see why I ca n't give them cigarettes , Brother . I can move . ( Crosses back of couch to piano , getting cigarettes ; serving Tommy first . ) BETTS For Heaven 's sake , do , then . ( RAIN , loud . ) SMEED We 'll hold up our hands while you do it . Stick ' em up , fellas . ( Peter is on bench l. with hands up . All hold their hands up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Where are you aiming , Clifford ? ( Crossing back c. , then down and sits on couch . Stanley comes in after Tommy . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE I 'm just giving them cigarettes , Stanley . It is rather a nervous strain . Could n't they have some coffee , too ? ( Getting the cigarettes and matches . ) ( RAIN , soft. ) p. 96 STANLEY ( Paying no attention to Julia and nodding at Michael ) You now , Mr. Meer ! ( Michael rises . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE Just a second . ( She puts a cigarette in Michael 's mouth and lights it . ) MEER Thanks . ( He goes toward door l . ) JONES ( Whispering ) Mention the coffee again , Julia . JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( To Stanley ) Could n't they have some coffee , Stanley ? ( RAIN stops . ) STANLEY Not now  --  Miss Vanderstyle . SMEED ( To Michael ) Good luck , Mike . JONES Do n't tell him any lies . I tried that . BETTS The truth is just as bad . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Michael goes into the room l . Stanley follows him , closing the door . Julia has given each of the Others a cigarette. ) p. 97 JONES Where do I sit , Cliffie ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Pointing to the couch with the pistol ) There , I suppose . ( Tommy shies at the pistol and sits on the sofa . ) JONES ( As Julia , standing back of him , puts a cigarette in his mouth and lights it ) Thanks  --  I 'm sure . ( Dolores stretches to show how stiff she is from sitting . ) Is Do tired ? WINTHROP Yes . ( Julia drops the box of cigarettes on the floor . Everybody jumps . ) What was that ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Julia ! JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Having picked up the box ) I 'm so sorry . I dropped the cigarette box . JONES I thought I was shot in the back . SMEED Did you think Cliffie shot you ? JONES Either Cliffie or Grandma . WINTHROP So did I. I 'm as jumpy as a  --  good Heavens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ petrified , as the LONG SCREAM of a hoot owl is heard. ) p. 98 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Only a hoot owl . WINTHROP Only ? What could be worse ? JONES It would be worse if it was n't a screech owl . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Do n't be nervous , Dolores . When you know what it is  --  it 's all right . I rather like it . It belongs to this old place , somehow . ( OWL hoots again . ) JULIA VANDERSTYLE It 's even more lonely and shivery than anything we ever have at the convent . JONES I bet the convent is gay compared to ( OWL hoots again . ) WINTHROP How far is the house from the entrance , Cliffie ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Only half a mile . JONES Have you only got two watchmen outside ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Two watchmen and two dogs . JULIA VANDERSTYLE We did have three watchmen , but  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Julia ! JULIA VANDERSTYLE But one of the dogs chewed up one of the watchmen . ( The LIGHTS flicker. ) p. 99 WINTHROP I simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES Which relative is it this time , Julia ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE It 's the storm . This time it is the storm . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Yes , of course it is . Lights are always going out . ( The OWL is heard again  --  nearer . ) JONES Birdie is drawing nearer . JULIA VANDERSTYLE One did get in the attic once and came right down the stairs . WINTHROP Do n't tell us any more , Julia . I shall shriek . ( Tommy accidentally touches her . She jumps ) I 'll kill you , Tommy . JONES Well  --  what do we do now ? SMEED We wait  --  for the great detective in there to detect something . BETTS What did he ask you , Tommy ? JONES Among other delicate questions  --  " Has there ever been a thief in your family ? " WINTHROP He 's too insulting . JONES Oh  --  I do n't know . As a matter of fact , my grandfather was a very successful thief . p. 100 WINTHROP Oh  --  come , Tommy . JONES He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted and then skipped . She always said it was worth it . He was the most delightful man she ever knew . SMEED I 've been thinking  --  since we 've been sitting here . Do decent people ever steal ? They do everything else , of course  --  murder , lie , cut throats in business  --  You can go in for every other kind of vice and immorality on earth and still be a lady or a gentleman  --  but do ladies and gentlemen steal ? JONES ( Hands on knees ) You mean you 're wondering if I stole the pearls . I kind of think myself I did  --  walking in my sleep  --  or something . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Your humor seems to me in slightly bad taste . JONES Humor ? Believe me  --  I 'm not trying to be funny . I 've thought till my brain 's woozy  --  dizzy  --  chasing itself ' round in a circle . WINTHROP So is mine . It 's the impossibility of it that makes it so strange . It just could n't happen . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It could n't happen . p. 101 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But it did . SMEED But it is not humanly possible , Cliff , that anyone who was in this room  --  took them . And it it not humanly possible for the pearls to get out of that chair by themselves . Now , what 's the answer ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE There 's nothing supernatural about it  --  if that 's what you 're trying to imply . JULIA VANDERSTYLE But there could be . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Now , do n't begin that again , Julia . You embarrass me . JULIA VANDERSTYLE You embarrass me , too  --  thinking somebody alive did it . Grandmother said the Vanderstyles and Van Dusens often came back and fought over things in the house . I could almost believe I 've heard them sometimes myself . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Rubbish ! JULIA VANDERSTYLE If it 's rubbish , why do lots of intelligent people believe it  --  English bishops and everything ? One of them wrote a whole book about it . JONES Would n't it be a relief to you , Cliffie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearls now ? You 'd like to keep them in the family , would n't you ? p. 102 SMEED What do you think , Cliff ? How about it ? Do you actually believe that one of us stole them ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE There 's only one possible thing I can think . THE OTHERS What ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Looking at door l . ) After all , we know nothing whatever about this chap Meer . THE OTHERS ( With one protest . Julia rises ) Oh  --  SMEED No . Too obvious , anyway . JONES I 'm sorry as blazes for him . JULIA VANDERSTYLE So am I. BETTS That 's rotten of you , Cliff . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I do n't know Billy 's voice well  --  scarcely at all , in fact . BETTS What of it ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Maybe it was n't Billy who telephoned . Maybe it was this Meer . SMEED What 's the idea ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Maybe a gang held Billy up and sent this one  --  all fixed , you know . p. 103 WINTHROP Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ VANDERSTYLE Certainly I have . They can do anything . SMEED It could be done , all right , so far as that goes . Lots phonier things than that happen every day . JONES Yes  --  but I do n't  --  This fellow 's all right . No  --  Cliff . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE It 's a terrible thing to think  --  and I did n't think it till I was forced to . But we must face facts . There is not anyone but Meer who could have done it . Is there ? You admit that ? Do n't you ? BETTS No one except the most plausible one of us all . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE What ? OMNES Who ? BETTS Stanley , of course . JULIA VANDERSTYLE Maybe it was  --  maybe he did do it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE That 's impossible . He was n't even in the room . BETTS But Michael saw someone in the hall  --  just before the lights went out . And you said yourself you touched someone out there . p. 104 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I did . And I 'm sure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touched him . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Naturally he 'd say that . BETTS You do n't think he 's a liar  --  do you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Well  --  Betty  --  if he took the pearls  --  you must expect him to tell a few lies about it . BETTS Not necessarily . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Nonsense . JONES No  --  could n't he steal the pearls  --  not that he did  --  and otherwise be a very honest person ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Absurd ! SMEED That 's what I mean . Could a  --  I know Mike did n't do it  --  but could an honest person , under some terrific  --  a  --  WINTHROP Temptation  --  SMEED No  --  not temptation exactly  --  but some new , sudden  --  a desperation  --  JONES Up against something terrific , you mean  --  that the stealing would get him out of it . p. 105 SMEED Yes . Can a perfectly honest person suddenly do a thing he could n't believe himself he could do . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE No  --  honesty is honesty  --  there 's nothing  --  WINTHROP Betty  --  be careful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BETTS ( Who has been sitting tensely , having forgotten her cigarette ) Oh  --  I forgot I had it . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Julia brings ash tray to Betty ) Do n't you agree with me , Betty ? BETTS What about ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE About honesty . BETTS I did n't hear what you said . ( She 's shaken with sudden nerves she ca n't control . ) WINTHROP Darling  --  ( She gets up . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE You must sit down , Dolores . WINTHROP ( Sitting ) Do n't go to pieces like that , dear . p. 106 BETTS ( Pulling herself together and going on quickly in a hard , nervous voice ) I 'm not going to pieces , Cliffie  --  I think Stanley was there in the hall  --  and heard me say  --  " I put the pearls under the cushion "  --  turned off the lights  --  sneaked in and got them  --  and slid out again  --  SMEED And brushed by you when you got out there . JONES That 's perfectly reasonable , Cliff . WINTHROP Absolutely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I told you  --  Michael could have turned them off from that table right there . SMEED How could he know that ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Easily . It would be part of his business to find out that sort of thing when he gets into a house . It 's all clear enough  --  the whole thing . BETTS It is n't clear . It 's mixed up and queer  --  just as queer as it can be . Why could n't it be Stanley  --  as well as Mike ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Because I know Stanley . He 's been here for years . He 's a man of high standing in his business . Why has n't he taken them before if he  --  p. 107 BETTS Because he never had this chance before . There was never a big enough fool in the house before to do what I did  --  to give him the chance . JULIA VANDERSTYLE I think he did it , Brother . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Keep still , Julia . How dare you say such a thing ! JULIA VANDERSTYLE I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JULIA VANDERSTYLE I never did . He 's always snooping . He has eyes in the back of his head . SMEED Why should you protect this man  --  and jump on Mike ? BETTS Do you want it to be Mike ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Of course I do n't . SMEED Then have Stanley searched . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I would n't submit him to such an indignity . SMEED Indignity rot ! BETTS It is n't fair to Mike not to do it . We 've got a right to demand that you let us search Stanley . ( Betty stands up and goes toward Clifford . The Others rise , All talking at once. ) p. 108 STANLEY ( Coming back from room l. with Michael ) What 's going on here ? Quiet . What 's going on here ? ( Crosses to c . ) Now , you sit down  --  and stay there . Why have you let them get up , Mr. Vanderstyle ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I could n't help it . STANLEY Where 's your gun ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I have it  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . JONES Not even in Scotland ? STANLEY This is n't a joke , young man . ( To Clifford ) Do n't you know they probably got up like that just to slip the pearls some place else ? OMNES ( Protesting ) Oh  --  WINTHROP You seem to forget entirely that we are Mr. Vanderstyle 's friends . STANLEY That 's what I 've always warned him against  --  getting the pearls out when his friends are here . I warned him against just this kind of a mixup some time . People he wo n't shoot  --  and people he wants me to handle with gloves . ( Looking at Betty. ) p. 109 JULIA VANDERSTYLE I have an idea , Stanley . STANLEY Yes  --  Miss ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE Suppose I go and telephone to Mr. Billy Tracy and ask him if he did send this young man . ( A pause . ) MEER ( Rising ) What ? JULIA VANDERSTYLE ( Rising ) Brother thinks there is a possibility you took the pearls . WINTHROP Oh , no ! CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Be quiet , Julia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see . JULIA VANDERSTYLE We can prove you 're not an imposter  --  by telephoning to Mr. Tracey . Shall I do that , Stanley ? STANLEY Oh  --  well  --  yes . Do it  --  Miss Vanderstyle , and do it now . ( Giving the key to Julia . Julia starts to the hall . ) MEER ( Rising ) It 's no use  --  he 's not at home . p. 110 BETTS Where is he ? MEER I do n't care to tell you . BETTS Why not ? ( Michael shakes his head . ) SMEED Tell us where he is and we 'll get him there on the phone . MEER It ca n't be done . STANLEY Telephone his house , Miss Vanderstyle , and see what you can find out . ( Julia starts . ) And lock the door after you when you go out . ( Julia goes out through the hall . Looking at Betty ) I want to talk to this young lady again , here . ( There is a pause . Tommy looks at Peter . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is wrong . ) JONES Go on  --  Pete  --  do it . STANLEY What 's this ? SMEED ( Suddenly rising ) We think you took the pearls . ( Crosses to c . ) STANLEY Oh  --  yes  --  I thought somebody would pull that old gag , and I suppose you think every servant in the house stole the pearls too . p. 111 SMEED ( Going to Stanley ) We want you searched . We were willing for you to search us  --  why should n't you be willing for us to search you ? STANLEY This amateur searching idea is good , too . You think I 'd have ' em on me  --  do you  --  if I took ' em ? ( Michael and Tommy rise . ) SMEED You might  --  under the circumstances  --  yes . Why not ? ( Steps up to Stanley . ) JONES Go on , Pete  --  do it ! STANLEY Just wait  --  I 'll save you the trouble . As a matter of fact  --  I have got a string of pearls on me right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stanley takes a package from his hip pocket . Betty rises . Stanley unwraps the white tissue paper and holds up a string of pearls exactly like the others . ) CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Appalled ) Stanley ! BETTS I knew it . WINTHROP ( Getting on her knees at end of couch ) They 're yours , Cliffie. p. 112 STANLEY They 're as much like yours as an imitation can be , Mr. Vanderstyle . Examine them . I do n't think even you could tell the difference , right offhand . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Taking the necklace ) What does this mean , Stanley ? STANLEY The last time I took your pearls to town to be restrung  --  I had an expert look at them and make these up . SMEED But how did you happen  --  to have those in your pocket just now ? JONES Yeah ! STANLEY ( To Clifford ) They were just sent up to me . And I consider my pocket the safest place to keep them . ( A pause . ) Yes  --  funny  --  is n't it ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After twenty years in this business  --  I know that the most unbelievable  --  ( Betty moves , scared )  --  things are usually true  --  and the obvious things cut very little ice . It 's usually the one you least suspect  --  ( Betty moves away a little . Stanley looks at her. ) p. 113 SMEED You do n't expect us to believe this fish story  --  I hope . BETTS It 's the most preposterous thing I ever heard in my  --  JONES Nobody on earth could believe it . WINTHROP You do n't  --  Clifford . Do you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I do . I believe Stanley implicitly . PETER AND BETTY Why should you ? STANLEY Why should he ? Because it 's me . That 's why . ( Throwing back his coat and showing his officer 's badge ) Do you see that ? I 'm as proud of that and my reputation as you are of yours and  --  a damned sight more so . I 've got to be honest . I make my living that way . Now , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are who you are  --  and do n't try to monkey with me . If there 's anything I despise it 's an amateur thief  --  who does n't have to steal . Give me somebody who 's got to do it to eat  --  or a good , clean murder  --  with a good provocation , and I might want to see him get off  --  but not this stuff . Now , listen  --  I 've given you every chance in the world to get out of this without a scandal because Mr. Vanderstyle asked me to . I 've had you locked up in here for half an hour telling you how serious this is  --  and you still seem to think you can get away with it . Well  --  you ca n't . See ? ( Taking a card from his pocket ) Telephone the Police Station and tell them you want the two best men they 've got  --  to hop in a car and get up here quick . p. 114 CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE But Stanley , I do n't want those men coming into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You want your pearls back , too  --  do n't you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Yes  --  but  --  STANLEY Do n't argue with me  --  please . If you want me to handle this , do as I say . Use the phone in there  --  and go in with him  --  the rest of you . I want you to hear what he says . ( To Betty ) Not you  --  Miss . You stay here . ( Clifford hesitates and then starts to the l. door . ) Wait  --  I think I 'll do the telephoning myself . You stay here with her  --  Mr. Vanderstyle . Go in there with me  --  all the rest of you . WINTHROP ( Going through l. door as Stanley nods to her ) It 's horrible beyond words . ( Stanley , Peter , Michael and Tommy follow her out l . A pause . Betty and Clifford listen , staring at the open door , then cross down r. , front piano . ) STANLEY ( Heard from the other room ) Hello  --  give me seven-six. p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you let this man treat us like this ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE It 's all in his hands . He represents the Law . He is the Law . I ca n't interfere . BETTS Cliffie  --  you  --  could n't want to hurt anybody  --  could you  --  ruin anybody  --  for life  --  could you ? CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Of course not . BETTS If you do believe that  --  that  --  someone of us  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE Oh , Betty  --  BETTS Well , that Mike did it  --  why do n't you go to him and tell him  --  you want to help him  --  CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE ( Quickly ) Then you do think he did it . BETTS No  --  no  --  no ! I do n't ! But if he did  --  would n't you be sorry for him ? He 's so terribly  --  I think he 's maybe hungry sometimes . You 've got so much , Cliff  --  STANLEY ( Off l . ) Hello  --  Police Station ? Hello  --  this is Stanley  --  Regan Stanley  --  What ? Yes  --  up at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just been pulled up here . Right now  --  no  --  an inside job  --  Yea  --  big . I want the two best men you 've got to get here quick  --  double quick  --  I 'll have somebody for you to take back with you by that time . What ? You bet it 's big . Green knows the house . Yea . I get you . Make it quick . ( A pause ) They 'll be here . p. 116 BETTS ( Desperately ) Do n't let them come  --  Clifford  --  make him stop them . CLIFFORD VANDERSTYLE I have to do my duty . STANLEY ( Coming back into room from l . ) All right . They 'll be here . Go in , please  --  Mr. Vander-style . ( Clifford hesitates and goes out l . Stanley closes the door and crosses and stands before the armchair . ) BETTS Why was it necessary to send for those other men ? STANLEY By the time they get here I 'll know who is going to ride back with them . ( Crossing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to be afraid of Stanley . ) Show me where you were standing when you were alone with him . BETTS ( Going to armchair l . ) Here . STANLEY And how near the chair was he ? BETTS ( Motions ) That way a little more . ( Stanley moves . ) There . p. 117 STANLEY Show me  --  now  --  how long your back was turned to him . ( She turns . Stanley makes a quick movement , running his hand under the cushion of the chair and standing erect as Betty turns back to him . ) Yes  --  he could have done it then . BETTS What of it ? He did n't do it . STANLEY Sit down . ( Stanley indicates bench l . ) They 've all tried to defend this boy  --  but every one of them has said something that makes me know they think he did it . What do you think by this time ? BETTS If I did think he did it  --  why should I keep still now ? Why ? STANLEY You 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course  --  because Clifford thinks  --  STANLEY You never saw him before  --  till three or four hours ago . Did you ? BETTS No  --  but Billy Tracy  --  STANLEY You do n't even know he is who he says he is . But you 're standing up for him  --  fighting for him to beat the band . Do you think that 's intelligent ? p. 118 BETTS Yes  --  I do . You said yourself just now  --  the funny things  --  the obvious things  --  are very seldom  --  STANLEY The best bet  --  yes . BETTS Is n't this too ridiculously obvious ? He would n't walk into this house as a sleight-of-hand entertainer and immediately steal the pearls . Would he ? STANLEY Not unless he was a damn fool . BETTS Then you do n't  --  STANLEY I do n't think he did it  --  no . ( Betty draws back a little . ) I think you did . BETTS ( Trying to call ) Peter ! STANLEY Quiet , now . BETTS You do n't seem to know who I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot about you  --  as I do about everybody who comes into this house . That 's part of my business . This new young man was slipped over on me . You and your mother play backgammon  --  at Bizi 's  --  do n't you ? BETTS ( Startled ) Y  --  es . p. 119 STANLEY You play for pretty stiff stakes , do n't you ? BETTS Yes . What of it ? Lots of people do . STANLEY You and she , between you , cleaned up about two thousand dollars a couple of weeks ago  --  did n't you ? BETTS ( Scarcely able to speak ) Yes . STANLEY And you lost twenty-five hundred last week , did n't you ? And you owe that to Bizi 's , do n't you ? BETTS Yes . How did you  --  STANLEY Oh  --  Bizi 's a friend of mine . Pretty much up against it  --  are n't you ? BETTS That is n't any of your  --  business . STANLEY Oh , yes , it is my business . Very much so . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has everything to do with it . ( Rises and crosses c . ) You 're a very clever girl , Miss Betts . Got more brains than all the rest of that bunch put together  --  and guts enough to do this thing  --  and you did it pretty well . I 've got to hand it to you . p. 120 BETTS ( Rises and crosses to him ) You ca n't treat decent people like this . STANLEY I knew something was going on  --  when I came in here after tea and saw you monkeying with that cushion . BETTS You were spying on us all the time . STANLEY Of course . BETTS Then you ought to know it was all a joke . STANLEY I believe you began it as a joke because you were bored stiff  --  this is not your gait  --  and then when you got into it and saw what a chance you had  --  you had the nerve to go through with it . BETTS It 's horrible . STANLEY I was in the hall  --  just before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . STANLEY Oh  --  no . The storm put the lights out  --  and you grabbed your chance and took the pearls then . BETTS ( Broken and helpless , crosses r. of Stanley ) I did n't . How can you believe such a thing ? p. 121 STANLEY ( Turns to her , and going close to her ) See here , Miss Betts  --  you 're not the first nice girl who 's been tempted in a place like this  --  with valuables lying around thick  --  and lost her head and did something before she knew it  --  and then would give anything  --  if she had n't . I know what it is not to have a dollar in my pocket . I 've served my time at sleeping on a park bench . I know all about it and just what it does to us . Now I 'm giving you a chance . BETTS What ? STANLEY ( Starts l . ) I 'm going to send this boy in here to you . BETTS Why ? STANLEY You 're clever enough to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them  --  no questions will be asked . See ? The others will think he took the pearls and slipped them into something here  --  but he 'll have the benefit of the doubt and  --  I 'll accept the fact that you found them  --  and nobody will ever think of you . See ? BETTS How can I find them ? I do n't know where they are . STANLEY You may . Take a look around every place  --  again . I 'll give you just ten minutes to find the pearls . ( Going to door l . ) Let me tell you I do n't give most people this kind of a chance . ( Exits l. , closing the door after him . Betty , stifling a sob , goes quickly to the table at r. , looks into the white vase which Michael put his hand in when he was standing by the table . She then goes quickly back to the front of the sofa , her back to the l. door , when Michael comes in , closing the door after him. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ MEER Yes . BETTS Come here . ( Michael crosses to Betty quickly ) He thinks I took them . MEER Oh  --  no , he does n't . He 's not such a fool as that . He does n't think you had a thing to do with it . BETTS He does . He said so . MEER That 's his method . He thinks I took them and he sent me in here to get you to get it out of me . Make me confess  --  because he 's accused you  --  do n't you see ? BETTS No  --  he thinks  --  MEER He 's stumped . He 's up against it . He may lose his job . He 's pinned it on me  --  as the obvious thing . BETTS No ; he says he 'll give me ten minutes to find them  --  if I do n't  --  What do they do to people ? MEER Arrest them , of course . BETTS ( Choking back a sob as she sits on the couch . Michael sits l. of her ) But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mike ? What do you think honestly ? How did they get out of that chair ? p. 123 MEER The only thing on earth I can think  --  is that he took them himself  --  the detective . ( Betty and Michael look at each other and away again quickly . ) BETTS I  --  I did think that at first  --  but now I believe he 's honest . I believe he really thinks I did it . MEER No  --  no  --  no ! BETTS I  --  maybe  --  I had better look for them . MEER What do you mean ? BETTS He meant to be kind  --  he seemed  --  to  --  understand . MEER ( Scarcely able to speak ) Understand what ? BETTS I can , too  --  I mean  --  you and I were just saying here a little while ago  --  in this hateful room  --  how  --  much money there is wasted in this silly stuff  --  and what it might mean to  --  MEER ( Carefully ) Me . BETTS Or to me . I do n't think anybody can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been frightened about  --  money  --  do you ? But I can . I could forgive somebody  --  who was just tempted for one dreadful moment  --  I could  --  could n't you , Mike ? Tell me that you could . ( She leans against him with a stifled sob ) p. 124 MEER I could ! Do n't be so frightened , dear . Everything will be all right , Betty  --  we 'll find the pearls  --  now  --  and  --  I took them , see ? It wo n't matter  --  I 'm nobody at all  --  I can prove it sometime  --  somehow  --  I did n't do it  --  and it wo n't hurt me a bit  --  BETTS Oh  --  God !  --  You do  --  you think I took them  --  Then you did n't  --  MEER You thought I  --  BETTS You did n't  --  you did n't  --  you did n't . ( She throws her arms about his neck and sobs with relief . He kisses her , holding her tight in his arms . Betty , kneeling on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Let me look at you . How could I think it ? I 'll never forgive myself  --  never . And you were willing to say you did it for me . ( He catches her in his arms again . Whispering ) I thought life was so ugly  --  and it 's filled with beautiful things . MEER It 's filled with you . ( He kisses her . ) BETTS But  --  where are the pearls ? MEER Never mind the damned pearls . I do n't care who 's got them . ( They laugh. ) p. 125 BETTS But what will we tell this man  --  now ? That we 're both innocent  --  just because we are . ( They laugh . ) MEER He 'll believe that . BETTS We may go to jail together . MEER I do n't care where I go  --  if you go with me . Oh  --  BETTS What ? MEER What about Billy ? BETTS Well , what about him ? MEER Do n't you care where he is ? BETTS Not a hang . MEER Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's holy I would n't . He 's with Milly Rivers . BETTS And he thought I 'd care . She can have him . I 'm tickled pink . But the joke of it is  --  I would have thought I cared  --  if you had n't fallen from the skies . MEER ( Takes out cigarette case ) We  --  it 's sort of funny  --  you know . We 've got a worse fish story to tell him  --  than he and his imitation pearls . p. 126 BETTS Give me one . I 'm all in . MEER ( Looks for a cigarette in his own case and finds it empty . Going to look in the box on the piano ) None here . BETTS ( Who has gone above the couch ) Maybe there 's some here . ( She opens the cigarette box which Julia dropped and stares at it . ) MEER What 's the matter ? BETTS They 're here . MEER What ? BETTS The pearls . I 've found them . MEER Do n't touch them . BETTS Why not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one thing you must n't do . Put that box down . BETTS But we have to tell Stanley . MEER You ca n't ! He told you if you found them he 'd let you off .

( They go to the table down r. and get a cigarette , lighting it nervously. ) p. 127 BETTS But how  --  how did they get in that box ? MEER He must have put them there himself  --  for you to find  --  as his own way out . I ca n't see anything else . BETTS Then you think he did have the real pearls ? MEER It 's the only thing I can think now . ( They look at each other for a second , laugh , and embrace . Michael kisses her .
