txt Throughout six hours of speeches to which the World Economic Conference was devoted today , it was not the address of Neville Chamberlain , British Chancellor of the Exchequer , presenting the first really concrete proposals for curing the world 's economic ills that stirred the delegates most . Nor was it Secretary of State Hull 's discourse in general terms on the evils of economic nationalism with the promise of " concrete suggestions " later . Neither of these greatly stirred the assemblage , although they were the principal utterances of the day . What really thrilled the conference most was a passage in an afternoon speech by Maxim Litvinoff , head of the Russian delegation , because it mentioned real money and envisaged for the delegates the prospect of getting some . Litvinoff Stresses Imports . M. Litvinoff uttered the usual encomium upon Sovietism and made the usual assertion of the growing prosperity and the lack of crisis phenomena under it that one expects from a Russian delegate on such an occasion . Then he mentioned casually that his delegation thought it would be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressing world markets , thus enabling industries to increase their production and capacities . He wickedly suggested it would be nice to hear from the other delegates what prospects of revival of economic life and expansion of imports  --  not exports  --  their countries could offer . Then he went on : " The Soviet Government as a rule draws up its import plans in strict accordance with its export possibilities and credit facilities But the Soviet delegation could conceive of conditions , such as lengthened credits and normal conditions for Soviet exports and other favorable factors , which might induce 1 its government to extend these plans to a degree which would have no small influence in alleviating this crisis . According to the calculations of our delegation , the Soviet government , given such conditions , might agree to place orders abroad in the near future to the sum of about $1,000,000,000 . " British Delegates Shudder . The delegates stirred uneasily . A market waiting for $1,000,000,000 worth of goods ! It was almost too much . This was Russia and there I were conditions  --  lengthened credits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Soviet products . Nevertheless , the British delegation  --  perhaps with a keen remembrance of the recent severance of Russo-British trade relations  --  visibly shivered . One delegate bent toward a neighbor and whispered a single word . It could n't be distinctly heard , but it sounded like " Adamzad "  --  and he looked like a reader of Kipling . In the Kipling poem " The Truce of the Bear , " Adamzad is " the bear that walks like a man " and is not to be trusted . The bear is the totem of Russia and the poem is considered to have political significance . Meantime , the harsh , strident voice , with its remarkable accent that is like no other , went relentlessly on . " To be still more definite , " M. Litvinoff said , " the Soviet Union could in the near future absorb about $200,000,000 worth of ferrous metals ; $100,000,000 worth of materials for the textile , leather and rubber industries ; $400,000,000 worth of machinery , including railway equipment to the value of // mentioning the United States once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the restoration of a satisfactory international standard , and what is better than the gold standard ? Central banks must cooperate closely and permanently . Exchange restrictions and customs quotas must go , but Mr. Chamberlain also suggested how to end them . I He mentioned the war debts as a factor of the economic disturbance that must be eliminated . But this had been almost expected . Mention of them will not get the debts on the conference agenda  --  it is too late . Altogether this was the most substantial contribution yet made to the work of the conference  --  a practical statement of the British view on all these subjects which the conference may adopt or not as it pleases , but which , nevertheless , gives it a definite substance hitherto lacking on which to work . Hull 's Speech Is General . By contrast the speech of Secretary Hull suffered somewhat because it was so general in its scope and so hesitant at this stage to suggest a concrete solution for any problem or take a position upon any question except tariffs . On this last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now need world trade ; high tariffs , quota reEduard Benes , Czechoslovakian Foreign Minister ; Paul Hymans , Belgian Foreign Minister , and the delegates of Argentia , Hungary and and Holl2tBd The principal countries have now been heard from , but there are many more speeches ahead tomorrow when the conference will also name the great economic and monetary commissions which had been expected to be chosen today . SOVIET HOLDS OUT BAIT TO PARLEY By FREDERICK T. BIRCHALL. // $100,000,000 ; $85,000,000 worth of agricultural goods , including breed stock ; $50,000,000 worth of consumers ' goods , such as tea , cocoa , coffee and herrings , and $50,000,000 worth of new ships , chiefly for industrial purposes , such as fishing , seal hunting , dredging and so on . Tells Significance of Figures . The interest of the close-ranged benches became more intense with each additional million . " The significance of these figures will be more evident , " continued M. Litvinoff , " if it is realized that they amount to from 25 to 66 per cent of existing world stocks in respect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead ; to 100 per cent in the case of some of the consumers ' goods I have mentioned ; to a third of the annual world export of machinery and 100 per cent of last year 's total shipbuilding output . Such figures qwq drawn up by the Soviet-Gov ; ernment and do not apply to goods urgently required by it and to , e i ordered under present conditions . 1We merely wish-to set this conference along the path which , in our opinion , is most likely to lead to effective results in alleviating the crisis . " It only remains for me to add that the vast majority of countries here represented might be supposed to be interested in the export of the commodities I have enumerated . " He paused and looked around . The delegates , who instinctively had bent toward the platform as M. Litvinoff 's voice rolled out the figures , shook themselves and awoke again . For one moment the pearly gates of economic heaven had opened and shown the golden streets within , but it had been only a dream . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference ** were attached those well-known strings . And this was an economic conference dealing with- basic principles , although momentarily the sideshow had usurped interest . British Plan Is Detailed . The conference actually is getting down to cases . What brought it nearer realities today than anything else was the evidently carefully prepared and detailed citation by Mr. Chamberlain of practical suggestions from the Bi point of view reg " rding the lines on which it may proceed to do some real good . About these suggestions there was little theory and much that was concrete . Prices must be raised ; how to raise them . Tariffs must be lowered by all-round equal sacrifices . Unfair State subsidies  --  and here the Chancellor of the Exchequer slipped in a typical British fling at shipping subsidies without per that trade . By mutual agreement they must cease , he said . " Has not the time come for governments to cease erecting trade barriers with their excesses and rank discriminations ? " asked Mr. Hull . " Honest intelligence now compels the admission that nations are substantially interrelated and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cooperation today is a fundamental necessity . The opposing policy of self-containment has demonstrated its inability either to avoid , arrest or cure the most destructive depression in all the annals of business . " He called upon the delegates to proclaim economic nationalism as it had been imposed upon nations a " discredited policy " from which the conference must turn aside . He called for the supplementing . of efficient home markets with capacious foreign markets , and he asked for " the will and determination among nations " to provide a key in the success of the conference to widesprei-d business recovery . To that end he promised practical , suggestions from our delegation later . c Reaction Not Enthusiastic . The conference reaction to the American position thus expressed was not enthusiastic . Apptause was fairly general but far from over-1 whelming . Perhaps the prevalent criticism was voiced by a Frenchman who , after deploring the lack of definiteness in the speech , re-marked : " It was the best criticism of American economic policy I have ever heard . " Cthers who spoke today were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proclaiming the stability of the Austrian currency against- great odds ( for which he received a warm compliment from Mr. Chamberlain in the latter 's opening remarks ) ;
