When her submarine-shy crew last week refused to sail the Greek freighter Thermoni home from Seattle , Wash. , its captain received an odd request . Fifteen Polish , German and British seamen , stranded in Seattle since the outbreak of World War II , and spoiling to get home to join their armies , had agreed on a working armistice , wanted to man the Thermoni and head her for Europe . British Seaman Charles Home , whose father died fighting in World War I , hopefully suggested that , once in Liverpool , his German mates might be permitted to proceed unmolested . <P> Failing that , they could anchor the Thermoni in neutral waters . Awaiting the decision of 1 ) the Thermoni 's nonplussed captain , 2 ) the U. S. Labor Department , all 15 hung around Seattle 's wharves , friendly as puppies.
