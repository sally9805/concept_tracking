txt A mass search for records of personal funds that might throw light on the operations of a racket in the electrical industry has been undertaken by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey 's office , it was learned yesterday . On July 14 the extraordinary grand jury which has been investigating the subject for many months caused the issuance of a subpoena : containing more than seventy names , and had it served on all the brokerage houses in the city . This subpoena demanded the production by these houses at the office of Mr. Dewey of all records in their files concerning those named in it . Specifically it called for " certified transcripts of all accounts , whether in the names of individuals listed below or of joint accounts or in the names of another person or over which the persons named below have full or partial control ; originals of all margin agreements ; duplicates of purchase and sales slips ; duplicates of receipts for securities received ; originals of charges and payments by cash or check ; credit memos for dividends and for checks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the persons named below ; all correspondence and telegrams or radiograms , etc . " Utility Officials ' Named The names included officials of large utility concerns , officials of civic organizations , the heads of electrical contracting firms , politicians and racketeers . Although the complete list contained eighty-six names of individuals and firms , there were many repetitions . Where , for example , persons named Henry were also known as Harry , both forms were listed . Also , the grand jury required the presentation of accounts in firm names as well as in the names of individual officers of those firms . The name of James J. Hines Jr. , an official of the electrical contracting concern of Emerson &; Hines of 370 Lexington Avenue , was not on the list , but the names of four women members of the Hines family were . Mr. Hines is the son of Tammany Leader James J. Hines , already under indictment as a member of the Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer mob in the policy racket , and his accounts have already been scrutinized at length @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the List One striking name on the list was that of Joie Rao , a gangster whose last prominent appearance in the newspapers was back in 1934 , when a raid on the prison on Welfare Island revealed him  --  serving a short term there  --  as living the life of a lord of the place . The name of Hines was mentioned at that time as having been used to bring about the conditions which Rao was enjoying . Such a sweeping search for personal financial records was indicative of the length to which the electrical racket , if it is ever put together in the whole , may . extend , it was said . Mr. Dewey has been digging at it for about a year , as special prosecutor and now as District Attorney , and a number of minor actions have been involved . As yet , however , the complex structure of the racket has not been bared . It has been described as perhaps the most ramified and . far reaching existing in the city . The electrical racket has been described as one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on at the same time that the industry is policed by a trade union to see that all agreements are carried out . There are , also , aspects of it in which union men refuse to work with materials other than those of certain specific manufacturers . All of these segments , it war said , tie into a somewhat unified whole . The grand jury subpoena was regarded as an effort to unravel the complicated tangle through tracing money belonging to victims who might have paid and those who might have profited . The special grand jury , originally impaneled as one of those to aid the Dewey racket hunt while he was still a special prosecutor , has examined hundreds of witnesses in connection with the case . Income and corporate franchise tax actions have been brought against several heads of electrical firms who have been , in the opinion of the investigators , unable to explain satisfactorily items of expenditures found in their books . More lately Murray I. Gurfein , Assistant District Attorney in charge of the Rackets Bureau and now heading this investigation , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the business men he believes hold the key to the situation . Horace W. Watts , a member of the contracting firm of , Watts &; Tankard , 420 Lexington Avenue , was sentenced to thirty days in jail for contempt in making evasive answers to the grand jury by Justice Pecora last week . His sentence was stayed pending an appeal . In this case Mr. Watts was questioned about checks that had been drawn in favor of a list of unsuccessful bidders after the firm of which Mr. Watts was a member had received a contract for work in John Wanamaker 's department store in 1935 . ' The amount of the contract was ' $179,250 . Less . than a week before the sentencing of Mr. Watts , John Griswold Livingston , club member and socially prominent and the president and . treasurer of J. Livingston &; Co. , one of the largest electrical contracting firms in the country , had been arrested on a seldom-used statute making it a misdemeanor to fail to enter substantial items on the books of a corporation . Also arrested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firm and an important stockholder . In this case it was charged that . the Livingston firm was the successful low bidder on a $150,000 contract with the department store of Lord . &; Taylor , and that . following this , $5,350 was paid into the firm without a bookkeeping entry , the money being credited to petty cash . Also , in the same period , there were withdrawals amounting to $7,000 likewise not entered . The subpoena was dated the same day that Mr. Livingston and Mr. Cooper were arrested , July 14 . It called for the production of all records between that date and Jan. 1 , 1929.
