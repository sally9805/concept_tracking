Who But Hoover ? HERBERT HOOVER , who , as you may recall , was billed for one of the greatest acts in the history of the White House , would be less than human if he did not ache to make excuses for himself on as many features of his historic failure as possible . In national political circles it is generally accepted that he is now a candidate for reelection and , of course , vindication . Mr. Hoover 's first nomination , as is well known , was a triumph of publicity . The same high-powered mechanisms are now at work to give him the leadership of the Republican Party in 1936 . And as a prelude to that he is busy picking up the parts of the shattered Hoover ? the great engineer ? of 1928 and reassembling them . In the last few months he has staged three major public appearances with this objective . He has made two speeches . But most important , one of his former secretaries , Mr. Walter H. Newton , has presented through The Saturday Evening Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finale ? the banking collapse of 1933 ? with which the curtain was rung down on Mr. Hoover 's gloomy four years . The former President must somehow dodge the deep damnation of that vast banking crisis . An administration which had begun with the implied boast that it was about to end poverty in America ended with every bank in America closed or tottering to its fall . Such a denouement must be explained . It will not do to have this ghost rising to haunt the candidate as he trudges the road to rehabilitation . I have examined the pretentious historical account of the banking failure written by Mr. Newton , who , of course , is merely the stalking horse for Mr. Hoover . It is so full of almost incredible distortions of fact , so many twistings of very recent and very well known history intertwined with unsupported assumptions and rationalizations , that it ought to be taken apart in detail . This I propose to do here . It will be remembered that Mr. Roosevelt , on the day after his inauguration , was forced to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the banks in the nation to protect them from further runs . This was the climax of twelve years of administration under Messrs . Harding , Coolidge and Hoover . It would be unfair to Mr. Hoover to assess against him the whole responsibility for this ghastly crisis . He had inherited the banking system . If he is to be more heavily charged with guilt than his predecessors it is because during three years of depression and in the face of the accumulating pressure of bank failures , lie did nothing to check the inevitable debicle . But as you read the apologia of Mr. Newton you gather slowly the impression that almost everybody in the world was responsible for the depression and the bank climax but Mr. Hoover . The real villains in the piece , apparently , were the inflationists ; the Austrian Creditanstalt , which failed ; the Germans , who ruined their country ; the English , who went off the gold standard ; the Democrats , of course ; those who forced publicity of the R.F.C. loans ; and , above all , Franklin D. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary to stay the storm when it broke in its final fury just before the inauguration . In this singular diagnosis you will not find the remotest suggestion that Mr. Hoover in any way shared in the responsibility for this disaster . He admits no mistakes . His policy was brilliant , masterful , flawless . It recalls those campaign speeches lie made in 1932 , when he went about the country describing the era as a titanic struggle between himself and the Depression , with the Depression losing all along the line . Briefly the Hoover thesis may be set down in a few sentences . 1 . The depression here was the fault of a world depression . 2 . Mr. Hoover had it whipped in the summer of 1931 , when the Austrian Creditanstalt bank failed , causing a repercussive panic in Germany , spreading to England , which was forced off the gold standard , thus shaking the world , including the banking system of America . 3 . Hoover went to work again on the depression and once again had it in flight in the summer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . It continued throughout the world , but was halted in America . 4 . It was halted here by ( a ) agitation for money tinkering and inflation , led by Roosevelt 's inflationist supporters ? Rogers , Warren , Wallace , Wheeler , Thomas ; ( b ) Roosevelt 's refusal to disavow his inflationist advisers ; ( c ) his refusal to adopt a program that Hoover had kindly worked out for him ; ( d ) the publication of the R.F.C. loans . All this started and quickened the flow of gold from the banks , which ultimately wrecked them . It was not a banking crisis at all . It was a flight of gold from threatened government raids . And in the last desperate moments Roosevelt refused to cooperate with Hoover to avert the collapse . Perhaps it is impossible to end an argument like this . It will rage endlessly between partisans . Facts mean nothing . They mean less than nothing to the desperate and humiliated politician torturing history to set himself straight with an unbelieving world . But there arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dispute . Of course no fair man will blame Mr. Hoover for trying to rescue his once great reputation . That is a very human motive . There is something pathetic in his grotesque explanations ; something that might well excite our sympathy were it not for his arrogant disclaimer of all responsibility and his ungracious flinging about of blame upon the wide world , far-away Europe , his political foes and even his old associates . Let us stretch the skin of Mr. Hoover 's strange defense against the background of authenticated history . Let us begin with the proposition that the depression had run its course in this country in 1931 and that then recovery was arrested by England 's abandonment of the gold standard . This was a world-shaking event . Its wide-circling waves struck our shores and , as Mr. Ogden Mills has frequently put It , banks in Iowa and Kansas and our West closed their doors because England , three thousand miles away , went off the gold standard . This preposterous argument is quickly disposed of . 1 . Why did not England @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some of her own banks nearer home ; some of Canada 's banks ? Why was the fury of that blow effective only against our curious banking system ? 2 . We did indeed have a slight , ever so slight , lift in business in the spring of 1931 . It was just a momentary pause in the swift descent of the business curve . It began about January and ended about March . Then the downward curve of the depression took a precipitate and terrifying nose dive , Which continued to the end of the year . The Austrian bank did not close until early summer , months after our brief and feeble flutter of recovery ended . And England did not go off the gold standard until September . The next proposition is that by the summer of 1932 , just about the time the conventions were meeting , Mr. Hoover once again got the depression on its back . World revival began . Revival throughout the world continued . But it was halted here in January after the election . What halted it we shall examine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had he been continued in power , this rise would never have been halted . Indeed , he says the " depression was over " In the summer of 1932 . Of course what would have happened in any period of history if events had moved differently may be a subject of incessant and fruitless argument . What would have been the course of history if Caesar had never been assassinated , if Woodrow Wilson had been defeated by Hughes , and so on ? In this case we have some guide posts . The depression is outlined on a chart by the descending business curve . But if you look at it you will see that this line did not move down equally and without interruption . It was checked at many points by brief pauses and even spurts upward ? in December , 1929 ; March , 1930 ; January , 1931 , etc . Each time the sinking curve Paused or fluttered upward a bit , Mr. Hoover promptly proclaimed to the nation that the depresNon was over and that recovery was here . Of course each @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The last upward flutter before he disappeared from the scene was in August , 1932 . Trade moved feebly up until November , paused until the Christmas trade , made the usual ascent , but quite lamely , and then dropped again , as it always does , when the Christmas trade ended . This , Hoover insists , was the end of the depression . That this was only one more weak pause like all the others as the economic situation moved to the inevitable collapse does not seem to occur to him . Now we are ready to scrutinize Mr. Hoover 's argument delivered through Secretary Newton to prove that it was Roosevelt and his minions who halted the rise . To do this we have to examine several preliminary propositions . First of all we are informed that " for three years in various messages , conferences and interviews the President unceasingly had been urging reform in our whole banking system . " This had been delayed by the difficulty of the task , by opposition of the banks and the Democratic House of Representatives . Then follows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have ever read . " Senator Glass , as the author of the bill finally worked out for this purpose , had given conscientious and patient service to it . President Hoover resolved to drive it through the last session of Congress . " Then follows an enumeration of the various provisions of the Glass bill . I submit that any reader would conclude from this that Hoover had been carrying on a vigorous campaign for banking reform and that Glass had been chosen to prepare and introduce the bill embodying these reforms . I followed that legislation carefully from beginning to end . And this is the first I ever heard of Hoover 's lifting a finger for it . Professor H. Parker Willis , of Columbia , acted as technical adviser to the Banking Committee in preparing that bill . He knows its history as well as any man . He has embodied it in a book ? " The Banking Situation , " published in 1934 by Columbia University . Professor Willis says what everyone at the time knew to be true , that not only did Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retarded it and prevented its passage , " to use Professor Willis ' words . Hoover several times said he was for statewide branch banking . But branch banking was no remedy for the evils of our rotten Kanking system , in which branch banks were actually accounting for the worst failures . In the closing moments of the administration , as the storm gathered over his unhappy head , and after four years of complete inaction about the banks , he did support the passage of another Glass bill , but that was an entirely different measure with certain emergency instrumentalities in it . Hoover 's chief contribution to banking was the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . In January , 1932 , bank failures became so general that the whole system was threatened with collapse . He then , instead of dealing with it to correct its shameful evils and weaknesses , set up the R.F.C. to lend money secretly to all sorts of bankrupt banks . It loaned money not only to banks , but to bankrupt railroads , bankrupt mortgage , fire-insurance and casualty companies . By June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that thereafter the depression was definitely ended and recovery began . By January , he insists , the banks were stronger than at any time in 1932 . And his inspired apologist makes this extraordinary claim ? that there were no serious hoardings or runs on banks between July and December , 1932 . Gold had flowed into the country , deposits increased , credit was resumed and a sounder situation was built up . All these facts arc susceptible of confirmation . Let us examine them . No serious runs on banks between July and December , 1932 . This is about as cold-blooded a falsification of still fresh statistical history as I have ever encountered . It was in this period that the first banking holiday was declared in Nevada . It was in this time that the run started on the Union Trust Company of Baltimore . I have made up a tabulation of the number of bank failures by weeks from June to December . Here it is : The total number of failures for the entire year 1932 was 1,456 , involving deposits of $715,626 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 657 . There were , therefore , almost as many failures after July , during Mr. Hoover 's " recovery " period , as before July . And there was not much difference in the amount of money involved . Moreover , the banks that were closing now were those that had been strong enough to weather three full years of depression which had closed thousands of others . But , in addition to the closings , the R.F.C. was pouring out millions into other banks ? many of them as shaky as those that closed ? which were kept open with R.F.C. loans . Bank deposits increased . This statement is made as if it were a phenomenon that flowed naturally from increased business . Between February , 1932 , and December , 1932 , government securities issued to the Reserve banks rose from $743,000,000 to $1,854,000,000 . This was enough all by itself to account for an increase in deposits of nearly a billion dollars . The loan of funds by the R.F.C. alone would have been sufficient to increase deposits by several hundred millions more . The fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , deposits decreased about $320,000,000 from June to December , indicates the desperate condition of the banks , the fall in normal deposits and the extent to which the heavy resorts to government borrowing and R.F.C. lending , plus Federal Reserve operations , failed to plug the gap . Credit was resumed . Credit not only was not resumed in the period between June and December , it declined by $1,771,000,000 , as shown in Hie record of bank loans in the Federal Reserve Bulletin , for July , 1933 . Mr. I louver 's whole assumption that recovery had set in is utterly rcfuted by the facts . His conclusion that it was Roosevelt and his own foes who halted that recovery necessarily falls to the ground along with it . Now for the last chapters . We are asked to believe that final difficulties were started by the inflationists . There was no bank crisis at all , is the theory , amazing as it may seem . People did not take their money out of the banks because the banks were unsound . They took it out because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would decline in value through inflation . The most casual examination of this statement will reveal its folly . But first let us see how the tragedy moved to its climax . It began around December 17 , with fears of inflation . But as you examine the record as made up by Mr. Hoover 's Mr. Newton , you realize that these fears were largely whipped up by Mr. Hoover himself and his friends . " Hoover and the Republican leaders repeatedly charged the incoming administration with intent to tinker with the currency . " As you go through the newspapers of the period you see less talk of the inflationists than there had been earlier . But you run into continual statements by bankers and Republican politicians that inflation is imminent . Senator Thomas made some statements , but I can find nothing from Warren or Rogers , as Hoover charges . On the contrary , Roosevelt himself had made the most conservative money speeches during his campaign . He had repeatedly assured us that he was for sound money . He had offered the Treasury portfolio to Senator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , and when Glass declined Roosevelt tendered the job to Mr. Woodin , who was also a sound-money man . What was in process from December to March is perfectly plain ? deflation . Deflation on the most extravagant and feverish scale . The whole business situation was falling apart . Hoover 's contention that all that had happened was the result of this inflationary talk and that the scandals among the banks , the forced liquidation by the banks , the complete bewilderment of business men everywhere , the bankruptcy of large business concerns , the demoralization of the wage scale ? all these things are to be ignored , is too fantastic to be accepted by any reasonable mind . The " enormous " withdrawals of gold amounting to only about $271,000,000 in January and February give evidence of the fact that people were thinking of getting their money out of unsafe banks and not trying to convert their holdings into gold . However , the situation became so had by February 17 that Mr. Hoover wrote a letter to Mr. Roosevelt . This letter is made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argument . That letter is one of the most amaxing documents in the history of presidential correspondence . Banks were closing everywhere . Several states had already declared bank holidays . The Detroit scandals had broken . The National City Bank scandals had been aired and Charles Mitchell had resigned from the bank . The Insult crash , the Krcuger crash , innumerable failures of vast promotional enterprises had shocked the country . Men were being discharged by hundreds of thousands . The sweat-shop was devouring the trade of more decent competitors . At this point Mr. Hoover had a plan to deal with the crisis . Only Mr. Roosevelt could carry it out . lie himself had been ousted by a vote of humiliating proportions . Yet he wrote to the President-elect , who was to take his scat in about two weeks , a letter of which , I am convinced , no other man in Public life in America could have been guilty . In the midst of this chaos , he began by asserting that the major difficulty was the state of the public mind . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the new President ? a reassuring statement . In the four major crises since 1929 i Hoover had met every situation in that fashion and with eminent success . He then launched into a long , boastful account of the manner in which he had attacked the depression and how he now had the nation on the road to recovery . All that was needed was a statement , which would produce " a resumption of the march of recovery . " As you read this letter you get the notion that you are reading an account of some past depression and how it was ended some time back . There is no hint that the nation was in the throes of that very present depression . Then he tells the President-elect that he should issue a statement giving assurance ( 1 ) that there will be no tampering with the currency ; ( 2 ) that the budget will he balanced ; ( 3 ) that government credit will not be exhausted by issuing further obligations to the banks . Also publication of R.F.C. loans should be stopped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this stubborn roan could believe that the people of the United States at that time cared about whether the government continued selling its obligations to the banks . It has since sold them some ten billions more and few are disturbed about it . The notion that a frightened citizen , on the way to a bank to withdraw his life 's savings , would be staved by an assurance that government borrowing would stop , that the currency would not be tinkered with and that the budget would be balanced , belongs in the domain of comedy . The budget has since been unbalanced more severely than ever , yet there is no banking panic . Moreover , you would get the notion that Hoover himself had balanced his budgets and that the people were afraid Roosevelt would not . Hoover made up four budgets . All of them were unbalanced save one . Roosevelt had denounced him for that . Roosevelt did not answer that letter until March 1 , giving some lame excuse . He probably did not know how to answer it . When he did he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be dealt with by mere statements . But on February 28 , Hoover wrote Roosevelt again . This time he asked that Roosevelt call an extra session . Also he said he still believed that the tide might by stemmed by issuing the statement he had originally urged . At that moment the crisis was in full career . hoover was debating whether he would close the banks , guarantee their deposits or let things drift . But the banks were closing all around him . Tennessee and Kentucky had proclaimed holidays . Michigan , Nevada , Mississippi , Ohio , Vest Virginia , Maryland , Arkansas , Alabama , Oklahoma , Minnesota , Louisiana and other states had either declared holidays or authorized banks to restrict payments to depositors . The end had come . Yet Hoover still thought a statement to the people that the budget would be balanced and that the government would stop borrowing and that the currency would not be touched , would end the crisis . Roosevelt , of course , wisely declined the proffered salvation and took his own course . There is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to close the banks , but wanted to keep them open until his successor took office . On the other hand , it is said by some that he called Roosevelt on the telephone and urged Roosevelt to join him in a proclamation closing the banks . Hoover denies this . Roosevelt 's friends assert it is true . Here is a point of veracity that ought to he settled . But the evidence is strongly against Mr. Hoover .
