OCCASIONALLY a trivial sentence in a newspaper gets hold of us and we stew over it for days , to the exclusion of great matters . Take the recent story about John Masefield , the poet . It was merely a routine dispatch from Oxford , England , quoting him as saying , apropos of nothing at all : " One of the things I most enjoy doing is pruning trees , although I do n't know a great deal about it . " This stopped us dead , for it seemed to shed tiny particles of light on the meaning of poetry and the poetic temperament . Does Mr. Masefield enjoy pruning trees all the more for not knowing much about it ; or does he prune resolutely on through the dark places of his own ignorance ? To know that would he to know a lot more about the genesis of poesy . Poets are seldom good scientists : their science is sketchy , and they depend for literary consummation on the music of intuition . We earnestly beg Mr. Masefield to tell us whether pruning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his ground , and were every snip hacked up by a lifetime of experience . Meantime , we shall write a poem . W hat size hat Fits a technocrat ? Who formed the habit Of killing the rabbit That gave the pelt That produced the felt That made the hat of a technocrat ? This poem represents a state of mind . It has all the overtones of undercon sumption , and all the undertones of overproduction . It has intimations of ergs , and the fear of joules . It means that the price system has been smashed , probably by a little boy in a cowboy suit . It means that though hats come from rabbits , rabbits are drawn from hats . A vicious circle . It assumes that Rockefeller Center will be paid for in scrip , and that one thing leads to three others . We are sorry now that we wrote it , and even sorrier that we tried to explain it , as it does n't seem to make anything any clearer . But what does ?

ARCHITECTS are an ingenious , if an impoverished , lot . Some of them are now earning money as guides . By calling Caledonia 5-8400 , anyone may arrange a personal rubberneck tour to a point of interest , under the guidance of an architect . It costs something like a dollar a head , and even includes trips to the Zoo , for children ? if there are any tots who are interested in the more architectural aspects of the city 's imprisoned fauna . We understand that the Morgan Library is also on the architects ' list of places to visit ; and we feel privileged to point out that this is a unique chance to get into the Morgan Library ? which ordinarily adheres to rather elaborate entrance requirements . What days these are ! No new buildings going up , and architects earning their salt by showing tourists through buildings that already are up . " Look , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ actually up , " L. ROTHAFEL started on Broad-kJ way some years ago , and has been working his way steadily east . It seems strange to find him now , in the fourth winter of his country 's discontent , on Sixth Avenue amid the shooting galleries , delicatessens , cheap jewelry shops , and employment lines ; but there he is . In one sense , his Music Hall is a triumph : it is the greatest vehicle for the redistribution of wealth in town . The Rockefeller millions are now the Roxyettes ' carfare . Whether the place can succeed is anybody 's guess ( somebody tells us , for instance , that the cost of running it is so great that a 75-cent seat does n't even pay its own overhead ) ; but already the project has taken a large chunk of one man 's personal fortune and distributed it to thousands of performers and members of the staff . The staff , incidentally , is large . It even includes an employee whose title is Supervisor of Hospitals . Apparently somebody is sick over there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new . I. Music Hall is via the Sixth Avenue " L. " Get off at the 50th Street station , now called Radio City 50th Street . Do not dress . Evening scats are 99c , $1.50 , $2.00 , and $2.50 . There are two shows a day , and all scats are reserved . There is little to choose between seats , as the acoustics are so good that you can hear no mar-ter where you sit , and even if you heard nothing , you would be that much ahead . The seats are comfortable and are equipped with program lights . The ushers are formally dressed and are polite not only to patrons but to each other . This gives you a sense of security . On the opening night , we heard one usher say to another usher , " Pardon me , sir , but can you direct me to the extra programs ?

" Mr. Rockefeller looked in good health but nervous , and was well groomed except for his hair , which had a tendency to stand on end . The theatre is impressive , not at all fussy in decoration , and satisfies the longings of Mr. S. L. Rothafel , whose notion of the perfect entertainment is to place everything as far away as possible and then throw a mist of steam in front of it . The first number was called " The Symphony of the Curtains . " It consisted of the curtain going up and down , to prove to the audience that it would . This established the keynote of the entertainment , and the remainder was in tune . In the main , the theatre effectively defeats itself . The Wallendas did their aerial trick without bringing sweat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too remote to he exciting . The Tuskegee Choir was brought North only to be bathed in steam .

Diamond . Teeth IT 'S the ladies who tell us most of A these anecdotes about taxi-drivers . This one is about a cabman with diamonds in his teeth . His name , says the young woman who hailed him the other day , is Bernard J. Rahoniwitz . As they drove along he asked his fare , over his shoulder , if she had ever " seen a guy wit diamonds in his teeth . " She said no , she had n't .

" Dey squeal and tink it 's cute . " Bernard then started his cab and briefly told the story of his life . Used to be in the liquor business in Detroit and Chicago .

He is n't prosperous at the moment but he wo n't part with his diamonds . " Ca n't get nothin ' for diamonds today anyhow , " explains Bernard . And then , of course de dames think it 's cute . Tea MR.T.S . Enrol- , this year 's occu- pant of the Norton poetry chair at Harvard , has been carrying a notice in the Crimson that he is at home to members of the university on Wednesday afternoons at five . One recent Wednesday he was surprised by the arrival of fifteen freshmen en masse , obviously curious to see what a poet looked like . After he had got them all seated , he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened rather weakly by apologizing for not having tea . One eager freshman took this cue and started gaily off on the general subject of tea . At the end of five minutes , he was describing how the leaves are pulled hack on the stalk ; at the end of ten , how they are dried . He then took up rather thoroughly the blending and breeding of various brands , explaining how some of them got their names . At the end of about twenty minutes , everybody was nervous and jumpy , including Mr. Eliot , who took to snapping the joints of his fingers . Some of those behind the speaker were making faces and signs . Eventually the self-expressing youngster had to pause to swallow . A determined voice came out of the shadows in the back of the room . " Mr. Eliot , apropos of tea , do you not consider Katherine Mansfield the most sensuous of modern writers ?

" Experts ARARE  --  BOOK collector told us this one on the Anderson Galleries and others . A few months ago the Galleries were called upon to sell a large collection of early-nineteenth-century books . One of the items was an anonymous pamphlet called " Death of an Actor , " dated 1836 . The style was de &; likely that of Dickens and 1836 is the date of the first Dickens publication , but the Anderson people could find no record of it in any Dickens bibliography . They did n't let this overcome their judgment , however , and in the catalogue of the sale listed the pamphlet as " Unknown Dickens Item , hitherto unrecorded , " or words to that effect . The catalogue had scarcely been issued when the president of the Dickensian Society was in to see about the item . He examined it minutely . " Not Dickens , " said he . " Not Dickens . " Next day in came Mr. Richard Gimbel of Philadelphia , noted Dickens collector . " Not Dickens , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the office of Gabriel Wells , the book dealer . " Dickens , " he said . From beneath his arm he took a copy of " Pickwick Papers . " The baffling pamphlet was merely a chapter from the book , which , as you probably know , was originally issued serially . Torn-Toms LUts GRUENBERG , who wrote both libretto and music for the opera " The Emperor Jones , " is the oldest of four sons and four daughters ; he was born in Russia , the other seven in America . He 's about fifty now . When he was thirty , he made his debut in Berlin as a pianist , but although it was a success , he did n't give any more concerts . He went in for composing , and after six years won prominence and a ten-thousand-dollar prize with a symphonic poem called " The Hill of Dreams . " He has done four operas , two of which were never produced . One of these was based on Anatole France 's " The Man Who Married a Dumb Wife . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after he had written it , and then the executors of France would n't consent . He has made three trips to Paris to argue with them , but without avail . Once every six months he writes rather wistfully for permission , hoping against hope . Gruenberg met O'Neill in Paris two years ago to discuss " The Emperor Jones . " They met at midnight and talked for four hours , or rather Gruen-berg did  --  he wanted to make certain changes in the play . For instance , he fixed it so that Jones shoots himself with a silver bullet , instead of being shot by his pursuers . O'Neill said , " It sounds excellent . I have no suggestions . " The playwright then went to bed worn out , but Gruenberg was wide-awake , full of plans . He came to America , rented a house at Old Orchard , and spent fourteen months doing the opera . The libretto is in English and German . ( Serafin , who will conduct it , wrote out a translation in Italian for his own use . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whistles " ' Way Down Upon the Swance River " and , in a moment of high terror , sings the spiritual " It 's a-me , it 's a-me , it 's a-me , 0 Lord , standin ' in de need ob prayer . " Gruen-berg studied more than six hundred Negro spirituals before he decided on that one as the best for his purpose . The composer of course spent a lot of time working out the tom-tom effects for the opera . In the play , they beat continuously , but in the opera he uses them only at intervals . " But in such a way , " he says , " that they will seem to the audience to have been beaten continuously . " The tom-toms will be Neaten backstage by assistant conductors of the orchestra . One tom-tom , several feet across , was obtained in Hollywood , where it had been imported from Africa for a certain talkie . The others are smaller , run-of-the-mill tom-toms , such as can be got around New York . The tympani section of the orchestra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ originally , planned to send some tom-tom beaters out to the rear of the audience as the pursuers of Jones got nearer and nearer  --  this to give the audience the feeling that it , as well as Jones , was being hemmed in by savages . He did n't put this into effect , however , which is probably just as well for the modern susceptible operagoer . The last we heard , he was thinking of using amplifiers on the tom-tuns as the climax approaches . The climax , no matter what happens , will be something , for at the end the four groups of pursuing Negroes , who have been hidden choruses up to that point , will emerge onto the stage , each of the groups yelling ( not singing ) in a key and rhythm utterly different from the others . This , Gruenherg says , will sound to many people like meaningless and unnecessary cacophony , but hack of it are fifteen years of study of native African music . The scene has been very hard to rehearse , on account of the various @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hard to sing something when three other people in the same room are each singing something else ? that is , unless one has had a great many glasses of cordial . Gruenberg 's only hobby is chess . He used to play a lot with the late Noguchi , the Japanese scientist , who was one of his intimate friends . The composer has been to Europe and back twenty-five times . New Mexico is really where he wants to go , however . He thinks he could write a " really magnificent opera " there . Jingle Bells THE merry music of automobile bells can he heard in Westchester in these times . It was all started by a middle-aged gentleman of melancholy humor . When the snow fell and the ice came , he was driven to distraction by the clack clack of tire chains slapping rhythmically against the rear mudguards of his car . The idea came to him to get some sleighbells and put them on his car , to drown out the racket of the chains . He found a few strings of bells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first they did n't work : he hung them on his front bumper , but what with modern spring suspension and shock-absorbers , you ca n't get enough jolt out of cars to jingle a single bell . He finally hit on the scheme of attaching them to the sides of the wheels , like the spreaders that hold tire chains snug . They jingled fine . Pedestrians hearing his sleighbells gazed fondly up and down the street , hoping to see a cutter , little children peered into the sky looking for reindeer . Eventually the news that you could put jingle bells on automobiles spread around . They say that dozens of cars in Westchester have them now , and although most of them go clack-jingle clack-jingle jingle jingle clack on account of the chains , it is far nicer than just plain clack clack . Only trouble : it is hard to find sleighbells . But , like ping-pong tables , they 'll probably he stocked by enterprising stores if much snow falls soon . The man who told us this says that the idea has spread to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car dealer he knows expressed the fond hope that auto bells will be standard equipment by next winter . The Spirit of Service RECENT news items that the Soviet government has thought up penalties for malin-gering Russian workmen has reminded an engineer ( who writes us ) of a letter he received not so long ago from a col-league in Russia . This colleague , also an engineer , wished to con-vey the news to his friend in America that work on the construction of the Dnieprostroy power station had been seriously handicapped through the lack of coOperation on the part of Mongol tribesmen . To get this bald statement of affairs in Russia past the Soviet censorship was impossible , be-cause everything is cooperation over there . The engineer managed , how-ever , to get his idea across . He wrote his friend thus : " I have found no evidence whatever of forced labor . On the contrary , the natives have been willing to cooperate on the project with the same spirit in which the American Indian aided in the colonization of the West .

Randall , Jr. , may mean nothing to you , but the chances are you have encountered one or more persons he has stirred into action , and you had better know more about him because he may radically affect your whole life  --  all our whole lives . He is the genius of the Prosperity Sales Corporation , which is the concern behind the numerous amateur fountain-pen salesmen seen and heard all over the city in the past few weeks . He has put forward real way to bring prosperity . " We have heard his plan discussed at length at several gatherings , but always without a complete understanding and usually with such difference of opinion as to its possibilities that we resolved to report more fully upon it , which we hereby do . Assume , then , that you want to be prosperous . The first thing you do is wait for a Mr. X to appear and sell you a Prosperity Fountain Pen at three dollars . You then find a Mr. A , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ D , to each of whom you sell a fountain pen . Mr. D is the lever which lifts your load of debt and poverty . You get $1.50 commission on him . ( You do n't collect on Messrs . A , B , and C. Mr. X collects on them . ) Mr. D then sells pens to Messrs . E , ' F , G , and H. You collect $1.50 each on the first three gentlemen . ( Mr. D gets the $ L50 on Mr. H , becoming a capitalist along with you and Mr. X. ) This is called the second stage . It 's all marked out on a chart , like Mendel 's law or the feudal system . Mr. Randall pays you $1.50 on the first three sales by Mr. E. Likewise the first three by Mr. F and G. That 's the third stage . From here on you go ahead rapidly as the salesmen multiply . Your takings triple at each stage . In the tenth stage , you have 6,561 salesmen working for you , selling 19,683 pens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stage alone nets you $29,524.50 ( what it nets Mr. Randall would surprise you ) . You are a total of $44,286 ahead . This used to be looked forward to as a gloomy stage in the process , for there was a rule limiting an individual to $50,000 profit . As you have doubtless computed , Stage 11 nets , when completed , $88,573.50 , and it would he necessary to quit at Stage 10.7144 + if a $50,000 rule were enforced . But now the lid has been taken off by Mr. Randall and there 's no limit . In Stage 15 , you make $7,174,453.50 . It may be noted that at this point , which you will reach by April 15 , presuming you started the first of the year and accomplished , through your serf-salesmen , a new stage each week , you may run into difficulties . At the end of your fourteenth week , you will have disposed of 1.73 pens per capita for the United States and Outlying Possessions . Stage 15 calls for the sale of 1,073,741,824 more pens , and to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asiatic market , which has a potential buying public of , say , a billion . The rest you might reserve for South America , where they would come in handy in writing off bonds . We ca n't help you with Stage 16 , which runs the total of pens up to near six billion . The fountain pen has no natural enemies , being unlike the codfish , which , as Mr. Arthur Brisbane once pointed out , would occupy the entire universe in quite a short time if not checked . Perhaps we may expect that next summer the earth will he covered several feet deep with fountain pens , as well as billfolds , pocket light-ers , and flashlights , which the chain people are also selling . The whole will probably form a geological stratum , busying both the depression and this harried civilization many feet deep , together with any readers who may find errors in the foregoing computations .

" FirmONE of the theatrical pro- ducers started last week to select the cast for is new show , and for one of the lesser parts sent for an old-time actor , a fellow Who in two-score years or more behind the footlights has never had much of a part but has been known as good for character bits of a certain kind . The producer thought he would make the old man pretty happy with his offer , knowing that recent years had been especially lean , but lie did n't . The actor was sorry but the part was too small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that once he might have been available for such a bit but that he had gone an to more important things ; he had , in fact , just closed a rather lengthy appearance in a role of considerable importance , and a lesser one now was out of the question .

He had been Santa Claus in a department store .
