Since women are barred from fighting bulls professionally in Spain , they can break into this lucrative industry only by dire expedients . In Madrid last week beauteous blonde Maruja Fernandez , who was a beauteous brunette two years ago when she broke into the bull ring for charity performances , declared : " I believe the Spanish fighting bull is nobler than man . Man is not like the fighting bull which will follow your cape if you are skillful . Man is always seeking advantages and trying to keep woman at a disadvantage . A fighting bull thrills me more than any man I have ever met . " <P> Commented Spain 's matador from Brooklyn , famed Sidney Franklin : " Maruja Fernandez never fights anything bigger than a two-year-old calf , and Heaven help her if she ever does ! "
