THE DOOMSDAY MEN-J . B. Priestley - Harper ( $2.50 ) . <P> In Midnight on the Desert , an account of his stay in Arizona in 1936 , Author Priestley presented one of the most excited and semi-mystical rhapsodies on that section that has appeared since English writers , with strange literary consequences , started wintering in the U. S. Southwest . Even the boldest guess could not have anticipated the strange desert influence that breathes from The Doomsday Men- a lively mixture of adventure , mystery and improbabilities , free of literary significance but heavily weighted with a moral regarding the curse of social pessimism . <P> At a tennis tournament on the French Riviera , a fresh-minded young English architect falls in love with his partner , a beautiful , pessimistic and wholly mysterious American girl under an alias , discovers only by accident , when she has vanished , that she is the daughter of an eccentric U. S. billionaire who lives somewhere in the Southwest . <P> In London , a brilliant young U. S. scientist is searching for a vanished physicist , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ professor denies his identity , frames his onetime protege to get him out of the way . Chief of the shady facts about the professor is that his real name is MacMichael , that he lives in a Mojave Desert hideout called Barstow . <P> In Los Angeles , a nervy adventurer is investigating the mysterious murder of his brother , a reporter . Clues lead dangerously to the Brotherhood of the Judgment , a fanatical sect headed by sinister Father John , whose real name is MacMichael . Sect headquarters are in Barstow . There arrive the architect , the scientist and the adventurer . During the next 187 pages , at the MacMichael desert palace , the three young men are shot at , kidnapped , finally escape an awful doom , not very much to a reader 's relief .
