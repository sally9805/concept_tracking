At Hornell , N. Y. last week two seagulls flopped helplessly to earth in the business district , their wings so coated with ice they could not fly . Thawed out by a game warden , they were soon sent on their way . Also last week , the misadventure which overtook two of Nature 's best flying mechanisms overtook one of Man 's best flying mechanisms 200 miles as the gull flies southwest of Hornell . Just outside of Pittsburgh , a twin-motored Douglas DC2 crippled by ice flopped helplessly to earth killing 13 people in 1937 's third major air disaster . <P> The plane was a Transcontinental &; Western airliner which had taken off from Camden , N. J. in perfect mechanical condition with ten passengers , two pilots and a hostess , bound for Pittsburgh 's Allegheny Airport . At the wheel was 32-year-old Captain Frederick Lawrence Bohnet , a TWA veteran . The sky was overcast but the weather relatively smooth . Flying above the clouds Capt . Bohnet brought his big ship to Pittsburgh without trouble . At 6:33 p. m. he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ft. out of sight of ground . He was ordered to circle once while another plane came in . " Okay , " he replied . For four minutes , as required , he flew west , gradually mushing down through the clouds . The ceiling was about 800 ft. and he broke through it in a slow wheeling turn over the little town of Clifton about three minutes after telling the field he was " okay . " <P> At that point he was spotted by another TWA pilot , Capt . A. M. Wilkins , flying in from the west at 700 ft. ready to land as soon as Bohnet was down . Wilkins saw the silvery monoplane about three miles ahead and 200 ft. lower in level flight . To his surprise he overtook it fast . When only a mile behind , Wilkins cut his speed in order not to pass Bohnet . Simultaneously he noticed that Bohnet was having trouble . Though the air was clear , with no turbulence whatever , the plane ahead was wallowing . A wing would go down five degrees , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wallow grew worse . While Wilkins and his co-pilot watched in stricken silence , Capt . Bohnet 's plane rolled over on one side as if about to bank , went completely out of control and dived 500 ft. straight down . Wilkins , an old friend of Bohnet , looked away at the last instant , but his co-pilot saw the ship smash into the ground , break into a twisted wreck like a disemboweled fish .
