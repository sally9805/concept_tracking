One is Ithaca , the legendary home of long-suffering Odysseus , and the other is Corfu , the early home of the Phaeacians , whose king , Alcinous , was the father of Nausicaa , one of the loveliest of all women in ancient literature . To-day the island ( one of the Ionian islands , occupied first by Venice , later by the French , then by the English until ceded by them to Greece in 1864 ) is chiefly famous as the place of retreat for the defeated Serbian armies in the year 1916 and as a target for some very loose and useless shooting on the part of the Fascist navy only a few years ago . It may have a great future as a winter resort , but is undoubtedly situated on one of the great European earthquake belts .

Explain this who may . I proceed from the Epirus further towards the south , and behold , Boeotia ! I mention this region , which lies like a vast , empty soup-plate between the hills of Attica towards the south and Thessaly and the mountains of the Epirus towards the north , most particularly because it is a classical example of that influence of Nature upon Man which I mentioned in the beginning of this book . To the average Greek of the good classical days , a Boeotian , although he came from the land of Mount Parnassus , the home of the Muses , on the slopes of which the Delphic Oracle had established its shrine , was a clodhopper , a heavy-witted rustic , a clown , an oaf , a lout , a gawk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap-stick humour of the early stage . And yet , the Boeotians by nature were no less intelligent than the rest of the Greeks . Epaminondas , the strategist , and Plutarch , the biographer , were Boeotians but they had left their native  | haunts at an early age . Those who remained behind suffered from the poisonous vapours that arose from the swamp-ridden borders of Lake Copais . In plain , modern medical terms , they probably were victims of malaria , a disease which does not tend to make people brilliant-minded . The French Crusaders , who set up as rulers of Athens during the entire thirteenth century , began to drain these quagmires , and conditions among the Boeotians improved . The Turks , of course , allowed the mosquitoes to breed to their hearts ' content and the Boeotians grew worse . Finally under the new kingdom , a French and afterwards an English company let the muddy waters of Lake Copais flow into the Euboic Sea and turned the bottom of ' this inland sea into fertile pasture-land .

The marshes are gone , the vapours are gone , the malaria mosluitocs are gone . And an entire countryside that had been crided for centuries as Exhibit A of rustic numskullery and noble imbecility was restored to normal behaviour by the raining of a few miasmatic swamps . And then we come to Attica , most interesting of the Greek lands . Nowadays we take the train that goes from Larissa to 1Athens and that connects with the trunk-lines of Europe . But the olden days those who wanted to get from Thessaly in the rth to Attica in the south had only one route at their disposal , route of the famous pass of Thermopylae . It was not really a  | pass in the modern sense of the word ? a narrow gap between two high mountains . It was a narrow track , about 45 feet wide , between the rocks of Mount Oeta and the Gulf of Halae , which was part of the Euboic Sea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacrificed themselves to the last man to save Europe from Asia , when they tried to halt the advancing hordes of Xerxes in the year 48o B.C.

To-day the pass is no longer visible . The sea has retreated almost three miles from the mainland , and all that remains is a fifth-rate bathing establishment where people afflicted with rheumatism and sciatica try to find relief in those hot springs ( thermos ' is Greek for hot , ' as you will know from thermometer ' and thermos flask ' ) which gave their name to a battlefield which shall be remembered as long as mankind continues to honour those who die in defending lost causes . As for Attica , it is a small triangle ? a rocky promontory bordered by the blue waters of the Aegean Sea . Between its many hills lie numerous small valleys , all having direct access to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in from the shore . The ancient Athenians declared that their sharpness of wit and clearness of vision were due to the delightful air they breathed . They may have been right . There were no stagnant Boeotian pools to encourage the thrifty malaria mosquito . As a result , the Athenians were healthy and kept healthy . They were the first people to recognize that man is not divided into two equal parts , body and soul , but that body and soul are one , that a healthy body is necessary to encourage a healthy soul , that a healthy soul is an indispensable part of a healthy body . In that air it was possible to look all the way from the Acropolis to the Pentelican Mountains that dominated the plain of Marathon and provided the city with marble . But it was not only the climate that made the Athenians what they were , and for that matter are to this very day .  | There was the sea that gave the people of Attica direct access to every part of the inhabited and uninhabited world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had dumped a steep but flat-topped miniature mountain , a sort of mesa more than 500 feet high , 87o feet long , and 435 feet wide , right in the heart of the plain surrounded by Mt Hymettus ( home of the best Athenian honey ) , by Mt Pentelicus and by that Aegaleus from the slopes of which the unhappy fugitives from Athens watched the annihilation of the Persian fleet in the straits of Salamis a few days after the troops of Xerxes had set their city on fire . This flat-topped , steeply-sloped hill had first of all attracted the immigrants from the north , for there they found what we all need ? food and safety . It is a curious fact that both Athens and Rome ( like modern London or Amsterdam ) , the most important settlements of ancient Europe , were situated not immediately on the sea but several miles away from it . The example of Cnossus , the Cretan centre of the Mediterranean world hundreds of years before either of them had been founded , may have acted as a warning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever exposed to a surprise attack by pirates . Athens , however , was more conveniently near to the sea than Rome . A short time after he had landed in the Piraeus , then as now the harbour of Athens , the Greek sailor could be with his family . The Roman merchant needed three days for the trip . That was a little too long . He lost the habit of going back to his home city , settled down in the port at the mouth of the Tiber , and Rome gradually lost that intimate touch with the high seas which is of such tremendous benefit to all nations aspiring to world domination . But gradually these mesa people , these inhabitants of the topmost city ' ( for that is- what acro-polis meant ) , moved into the plain , built houses round the foot of their hill , surrounded them with walls , finally connected these fortifications and those of the Piraeus and settled down to a glorious life of trade and robbery which ere long made their impregnable fortress the richest metropolis of the entire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a place of abode and became a shrine ? a  | shrine which lifted its white marble temples proudly against the violet-tinted sky of Attica ? a shrine which even to-day , when an explosion in a Turkish powder-magazine has destroyed some of its more important buildings ( during the siege of Athens in 1645 ) , remains unique and sublime among those show-places where the genius of man is revealed in its highest forms of perfection . When Greece regained her liberty in 1829 Athens had dwindled to a mere village of 2000 inhabitants . In 187o it had a population of 45,000 . To-day it has 453,000 . If the Greeks had not gambled with fate immediately after the Great War , and had not foolishly thrown away all those immensely valuable possessions they had acquired in Asia Minor , Athens to-day would be the centre of a mighty Aegean power . But all that may still happen in the near future . The mills of the gods grind slowly but they continue day and night . And the city , called after the shrewdest and wisest daughter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has shown tremendous power of recuperation . This brings us to the last and most distant part of the great Greek peninsula and there , alas , our confident and prophetic words of hope are of no further avail . The curse that rested upon Pelops on account of his father 's great wickedness has never been lifted from the land upon which that unfortunate prince bestowed his name . Here , hidden from the sea by mighty mountain-ranges , lay the idyllic land of Arcadia , praised by all poets as the home of simple but honest and lovable shepherds and shepherdesses . Poets are apt to wax most enthusiastic about that of which they know least . For the Arcadians were not more honest than the rest of the Greeks . If they did not practise the shabby tricks of their more sophisticated fellow-Hellenes , it was not because they disapproved of them . It was simply because they had never heard of them . It is true they did not steal , but there was nothing worth the taking in a country of dates and goats . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that everybody knew everything about everybody anyway . And if they kept away from the refined and decadent luxuries of those  | gods worshipped in Eleusis and other Athenian centres of mysteries , they had a deity of their own , the great god Pan , who easily out-distanced the other Olympians when it came to coarse jokes and the low wit of country yokels . It is true , then as now , that the Arcadians could fight , but it did them little good , for like most peasants they loathed discipline and could never agree upon who should be their commander-in-chief Southward of mountainous Arcadia stretched the plain of Laconia , a fertile plain , infinitely more fertile than the valleys of Attica , but sterile as to independence of thought and barren of all ideas that stretched beyond the mere necessities of life . In this plain the most curious city of antiquity was situated . Its name was Sparta , and it stood for everything the northern Greeks held in abhorrence . Athens said " yea " unto life and Sparta said " nay . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficiency and service . Athens proudly preached the divine right of her exceptional individuals . Sparta reduced all men to the dreary monotony of the mediocre . Athens opened its doors wide to foreigners . Sparta kept them out of the country or murdered them . The Athenians were born traders , but no Spartan was allowed to soil his hands with business . If we are to judge by the final success of these two policies , the town of Sparta did not do so well . The spirit of Athens has penetrated the whole world . The spirit of Sparta has gone the way of the city that gave it birth ? it has disappeared . You will find a place called Sparta on the modern maps of Greece . It is a village composed of small farmers and humble keepers of silkworms . It was built in 1839 on the spot where ancient Sparta was supposed to have stood . English enthusiasm provided the money , a German architect drew the plans . But no one wanted to go and live there . To-day , after almost a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old curse of Pelops ! A curse that makes itself felt even more distinctly in another part of the peninsula ? a curse that co ? s to full fruition in the prehistoric fortress of Mycenae . The ruins of Mycenae are not far away from Nauplia , the best-  | known harbour of the Peloponnesus , situated on the gulf of that name . The town was destroyed five centuries before the birth of Christ . But to us people of the modern world it is of more direct importance than even Athens or Rome . For it was here that long before the beginning of written history civilization for the first time touched the shores of savage Europe . In order to understand how this came about , look at the three half-submerged ridges of the great Balkan hand that reaches from Europe to Asia . These fingers are composed of islands . Those islands nowadays belong to Greece except for a few in the eastern part of the Aegean which Italy has occupied and continues to occupy for the reason that no other nation wants to go to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distant sea . For convenience sake we divide those islands into two groups , the Cyclades near the Grecian coast , and the Sporades near the coast of Asia Minor . Those islands , as St Paul knew , are within short sailing distance of each other . And they formed the bridge across which the civilization of Egypt and Babylonia and Assyria moved westward until it reached the shores of Europe . Meanwhile that civilization , under the influence of those early immigrants of Asiatic origin who had settled down on the Aegean islands , had already been very distinctly Easternized , ' and it was in that form that finally it reached Mycenae , which should have become what Athens afterwards became , the centre of the classical Greek world . Why did n't this happen ? We do not know . No more than we know why Marseilles , the logical successor to Athens as the dominating power of the Mediterranean , should have been forced to surrender that honour to a very modern and very upstart village called Rome . The short-lived glory of Mycenae and its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you will object , all that is history and this is supposed to be a book on geography . But in Greece , as in many ancient lands , history and geography have become so interwoven that the two can not be discussed separately . And from a modern point of view there are only a few geographical items really worth mentioning .  | The isthmus of Corinth has been pierced by a canal about four miles long but too shallow and too narrow for large vessels . Greece , as a result of a series of wars with Turkey ( alone and together with Bulgaria , Serbia , and Montenegro ) , almost doubled her territory , then lost one-half of all those new acquisitions because in her dreams of grandeur she underestimated the fighting qualities of the Turks . The Greeks to-day , as in ancient times , take readily to the sea , and the blue and white flag of the republic ( the ancient Bavarian colours imported by the first king of the country after it had regained its independence in 1829 ) is to he seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the North Sea and the Baltic , where such Grecian vessels are famous for their slovenliness and dirt . And for the rest , there are the figs and the olives and currants that are exported to all countries that care for such delicacies . Will Greece ever return to her ancient glories as so many of her people hope and fervently expect ? Perhaps . But a nation overrun in turn by Macedonians , by Romans , by Goths and Vandals and Slays , conquered and turned into a colony by Normans , Byzantines , Venetians , and the unspeakable riffraff of the Crusades , then almost completely depopulated and repopulated by Albanians , forced to live under Turkish domination for almost four entire centuries , and used as a base of supply and a battlefield by the forces of the Allies in the Great War ? such a nation has suffered certain hardships from which it will find it extremely difficult to recuperate . As long as there is life there is hope . But for Greece it is a slender one .  | ITALY , WHICH BECAUSE OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OR A LAND-POWER , AS OCCASION DEMANDED GEOLOGICALLY speaking , Italy is a ruin ? all that is left of a vast mountain complex which formed a square like modern Spain but which withered away ( as even the hardest rock will do in the course of a few million years ) and finally disappeared beneath the waters of the Mediterranean . Only the easternmost part of that ancient mountain-range is visible to-day , the Apennines , which reach from the valley of the Po to Calabria in the toe of the boot . Corsica , Elba , and Sardinia are visible remnants of that high prehistoric plateau . Sicily was of course another part of it . Here and there in the Tyrrhenian Sea small islands betray the presence of ancient pinnacles . It must have been a terrific tragedy when all that land was captured by the sea . But as it happened some 20,000,000 years ago , when the earth suffered from the last of its great volcanic epidemics , there was no one present to tell the tale . And in the end it proved to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Apennine peninsula , for it gave them a country enjoying such sublime natural advantages of climate , soil , and geographical position that it seemed predestined to become the dominating power of antiquity and one of the most important factors in the development and dissemination of art and knowledge . Greece was the hand that reached out to Asia , caught hold of the ancient civilization of the valleys of the Nile and the Euphrates , and re-exported this commodity to the rest of Europe . But all that time the Greeks themselves remained something apart from the continent upon which they bestowed their manifold  | blessings . Their country might just as well have been an island . The fact that it was a peninsula did not do it any good , for rows and rows of mountains , indeed the whole of the Balkan range , cut it off from the rest of European humanity . Italy , on the other hand , enjoyed the advantages of being both a sort of island , surrounded on three sides by the sea , and at the same time very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We often overlook that fact and talk of Spain and Greece and Italy as if they more or less resembled each other . Spain and Greece had much in common . The Pyrenees and the Balkan mountain ranges were impassable barriers between north and south . But the great plain of the Po was a salient that reached well up into the heart of Europe . The northernmost cities of Italy enjoy a higher latitude than Geneva or Lyons . Even Milan and Venice are of a higher latitude than Bordeaux and Grenoble , while Florence , which we unconsciously associate with the very heart of Italy , is almost on a line with Marseilles . And furthermore , the Alps , although much higher than the Pyrenees and the mountains of the Balkans , had been formed in such a way as to offer comparatively easy access from south to north . The Rhine and the Rhone cleave through the Alps , and the valleys of the little brooks and streams running into the Rhine and Rhone , making an angle of ninety degrees with the mother river , offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hannibal , with his elephants , was the first to prove , to the great dismay of the unsuspecting Romans . Italy therefore was able to play a dual role , that of a maritime nation , dominating the Mediterranean , and that of a continental power , conquering and exploiting the rest of Europe . When the Mediterranean ceased to be a world sea , and the discovery of America had made the Atlantic Ocean all-important for commerce and civilization , Italy lost her former advantages . Without coal and iron she could not hope to compete with the industrial countries of the West . But for almost twelve hundred years , from the founding of Rome in 753 B.C. till the fourth century of our era , Italy dominated and administered every part of Europe south of the Elbe and the Danube .  | Unto the wild Germanic tribes from Asia that had invaded Italy in the fifth century and were now quarrelling violently for the possession of this desirable far west , ' Italy gave their first conception of law and order and the superior advantages of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nomadic existence . Of course she enriched herself incredibly at the expense of every one else . But while taking a heavy toll of taxes , she delivered certain goods ' that were to shape the destinies of all those different regions for all times to come . And even to-day , the more than casual observer , visiting Paris or Bucharest , Madrid or Treves , will at once be struck by a certain similarity of look and outlook on the part of the inhabitants . He will be surprised that he can read the signs on the shops , no matter whether they are in French or Spanish or Rumanian or Portuguese . And then he will realize : " I am in an old Roman colony here . All this land once upon a time belonged to Italy . The first houses were built by Italian architects , the first streets were laid out by Italian generals , the first traffic and commercial regulations were written in the tongue of central Italy , " and he will begin to appreciate what tremendous natural advantages were enjoyed by this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mainland . At the same time , the fortunate geological accident which had enabled Italy to conquer the whole of the known world carried with it certain very decided drawbacks . A country born out of volcanic upheavals was for ever threatened with death by the very mother that had given it birth . For Italy is not only the classical land of moonlit ruins , orange trees , mandolin concerts , and picturesque peasants . It is also the classical land of volcanic eruptions . Every Italian who reaches threescore and ten ( it should be easy in a country where laughter and gracious manners seem to come as natural as grouchy grins and boorishness do in other less favoured parts of the world , but , alas ! statistics tell a different story ) is sure to have been an active participant in at least one major earthquake and a couple of minor ones before he is reverently carried to the family grave in the Campo Santo . The Kismograph ( most reliable of instruments ? I wish all instruments  | were as painstakingly true ) reported @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The next year , 1908 , Messina was completely destroyed . If you want a few vital statistics ( and mere figures are often infinitely more eloquent than pages of print ) here is the record for the island of Ischia , situated just opposite Capri . That island alone suffered from earthquakes in 1228 , 1302 , 1762 , 1796 , 1805 , 1812 , 1827 , 1828 , 183.4 , 1841 , 1851 , 1852 , 1863 , 1864 , 1867 , 1874 , 1875 , 1880 , 1881 , 1883 , etc. , etc . As a result of these millions of years of volcanic eruptions , enormous tracts of Italian land got gradually covered with thick layers of tufa or tuff , a soft sort of rock composed of volcanic ash , thrown up by craters when in a state of violent eruption . These layers of tufa are very porous and they have a very decided influence upon the landscape of the entire peninsula . Some of those tufa fields cover areas of not less than 4000 square miles , and the classical seven hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ash . But there are other geological developments , also the result of prehistoric upheavals , which make the soil of Italy so treacherous . The Apennines , which run the entire length of the peninsula , dividing it nearly into halves , are for a great part composed of limestone , a softish substance which lies on top of the older and harder rock formations . This limestone is apt to slide . The ancient Italians were so thoroughly familiar with this fact that even in the absence of volcanic upheavals they used to inspect the boundary lines of every large country estate once in twenty years to see whether the stone marks , indicating where one man 's property ended and another man 's began , were still in their correct position . And the modern Italians are made to realize this sliding process ' of their soil ( and in a very costly and painful way ) every time a railway is pushed out of shape or a road is squashed to pieces or another village is rolled down the embankment of a lovely green mountain . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of towns perched on the tops of high hills . The usual explanation is that the original inhabitants fled to those eagles ' nests for  | safety 's sake . That , however , was only a secondary consideration . When they moved to those uncomfortable pinnacles , so far removed from the main routes of communication , they did so primarily to avoid the dangers of sliding to death . Near the top of the mountains the base rocks of the ancient geological structure usually came to the surface and offered future residents a permanent place of abode . The sides of the hills , covered with soapy limestone , were as dependable as quicksand . Hence those picturesque villages that look so marvellous from a distance and are so incredibly uncomfortable once one is inside . And this brings us to a consideration of modern Italy . For Italy , unlike Greece , does not merely have its future behind it . It works intelligently and courageously towards a new goal , and if it keeps long hours , it does so to undo the damage of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and honourable status among the ranking nations of the earth . In the year 187o Italy once more became a united nation , and as soon as the struggle for independence was over and the foreign rulers had been driven back across the Alps ( where they belonged ) the Italians started upon the gigantic and well-nigh hopeless task of putting their long-neglected house in order . First she turned her attention to the valley of the Po ? the larder from which the whole peninsula could he conveniently fed . The Po is not a very long river as rivers go . As a matter of fact , if you will look at the picture of the comparative length of rivers , you will notice that the Volga is the only European river that is a fit candidate for such honours . The Po , which keeps close to 45 ? N. lat. , is only 420 miles long , but its basin area , the territory from which it draws its tributaries and which therefore comes under its direct influence , is 27,000 square miles . That is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Po has some other qualities which make it unique . It is navigable for nearly five-sixths of its entire length and it is one of the fastest delta-builders of the world . Every year it adds almost three-quarters of a square mile to its delta and pushes it zoo feet further outward . If it continues to do this for another ten centuries , it will have reached the opposite coast of the Istrian  | peninsula , and Venice will be situated on a lake , separated from the rest of the Adriatic by a dam seven miles wide . Part of this vast amount of sediment which the Po carries to the sea has of course sunk to the bottom of the river and has filled it up with a layer of solid substance several feet thick . In order to keep the ever-rising river from flooding the surrounding landscape , the people living along its banks had to build dikes . They began to do this in Roman times . They are still doing it . As a result , the surface of the Po is much higher than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dikes are thirty feet high and the river runs at the same height as the roofs of the houses . But the Po region is famous for something else . Once upon a time , and not so very long ago geologically speaking , the entire northern plain of Italy was part of the Adriatic Sea . Those lovely Alpine gorges which are now so popular with the summer tourists were narrow bays , like the fjords , the submerged valleys of the modern Norwegian mountains . These valleys were the outlet for the water that descended from the glaciers which then covered the greater part of Europe and of course a great deal more of the Alps than they do to-day . Glaciers get thickly covered with stones that roll down on them from the mountain slopes between which they pass on their way downward . Such fringes of rocks are called moraines . When two glaciers meet , two moraines are bound to combine into a moraine double as high as the original ones , which is then called a median moraine , ' and when the glacier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is called the terminal moraine . ' These terminal moraines are a sort of geological beaver-dam ; they wall off the uppermost part of the valley from the lower . As long as the glacier period lasts , there will be enough water to make the terminal moraines a negligible hindrance for the water on its downward course . But gradually , as the glaciers disappear and there is less and less water , the terminal moraine rises higher than the water and we get a lake . All the north Italian lakes , the Lago Maggiore , the Lago di Como and the Lago di Garda , are mainly moraine lakes . When man appeared upon the scene and began his works of irrigation ,  | those moraine lakes acted as handy reservoirs . For in the spring , when the snow began to melt , they caught the surplus water which , if it had descended upon the valley in one solid body , would have caused the most destructive inundations . The Lago di Garda can rise twelve feet and the Lago Maggiore as much as fifteen feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ simple system of locks will then do the rest and tap those lakes according to necessity . At a very early date the inhabitants of the great Po plain began to make use of this fortunate circumstance . They connected with canals the hundreds of little streams that feed the Po . They built dams and dikes , and to-day thousands of cubic feet of water pass through these canals every few minutes . It was an ideal region for the growing of rice . In the year 1.468 the first rice plants were introduced by a Pisa merchant and to-day the rice-terraces are a common sight on the central plain of the Po . Other crops , corn and hemp and beet-root , were added , and the vast plain , although it has less rainfall than the rest of the Italian peninsula , is the most fertile region of the entire country . But not only did it provide man with food . It also looked after his wife 's garments . Early during the ninth century , the mulberry tree , which is the basic necessity for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hither from China by way of Byzantium , the eastern half of the Roman Empire , which survived until 1453 when the Turks took its chief city , Constantinople , and turned it into the capital of their own empire . The mulberry tree found ideal living conditions in Lombardy , the plain of the Po , so called after the Lombards or Long Beards , a Teutonic tribe from the mouth of the Elbe who lived there for a long time . To-day almost half a million people are engaged in the silk industry , and their product ranks much higher than that of China and japan , the original home of Bombyx mori , that inconspicuous little insect who provides us with the most luxurious of our wearing apparel . No wonder that the whole of the plain is densely populated . The original town builders , however , kept at a safe distance from the river . Their engineering technique had not yet far enough  | advanced to provide them with reliable dikes , and furthermore they feared the marshes , which appeared every year after the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Savoy , which now rules over the whole of Italy , and the connecting point for the passes that lead into France and Switzerland ( the pass of the Mont Cenis going to France and the St Bernard pass , famous for its dogs and monastery , giving access to the valley of the Rhone ) , is the only city of any importance directly situated on the Po . But it is so high that it needed have no fear of drowning . As for the other cities , Milan , the capital of that region , meetingpoint for five important trade-routes ( the St Gotthard road , the Simplon , the small St Bernard , the Maloja and the Splugen pass ) , lies half-way between the river and the Alps . Verona , the end station of the Brenner pass , one of the oldest connexions between Germany and Italy , lies at the foot of the Alps themselves . Cremona , famous as the home of Stradivarius , Guarnerius , and the Amati family , the fiddle-making dynasties , lies near the Po , but Padua @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the oldest universities of Europe ) are all at a safe distance from that main artery upon which they depend for their prosperity . The same is true of two of the most romantic cities of the ancient world , Venice and Ravenna . Venice , the town in which 157 canals , 28 miles in length , serve the purpose of streets , was originally a place of shelter for those who no longer considered themselves safe on the mainland and who preferred the discomforts of the mud banks thrown up by the Po and several smaller rivers to the dangers that followed in the wake of the barbarian invasions . Once there , these fugitives discovered that they had a mine of wealth in the salt which lay there , so to speak , for the picking . Their salt monopoly started them on the road to riches . Their straw-covered huts became marble palaces . Their fishing boats assumed the size of warships . For almost three entire centuries they were the leading colonial power of the entire civilized world and lorded it over Pope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same time a most elegant air . When news of the safe return of Columbus and the discovery ( the supposed discovery , of course ) of the road to India reached the Rialto , their  | business quarter , there was a panic . All stocks and bonds dropped fifty points . For once the brokers were prophets , for Venice never recovered from this blow . Her well-protected trade-routes became a useless investment . Lisbon and Seville succeeded her as the international store-house towards which all of Europe turned for its spices and other Asiatic and American products . Venice , gorged with gold , became the Paris of the eighteenth century . All the rich young men who cared for a genteel education and some rather less genteel entertainment went to Venice . When the carnival began to last the greater part of the year the end had come . Napoleon conquered the city with a corporal 's squad . The canals are still there for you to admire . Another twenty years and the motor-boat will have destroyed them . The other city , also a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is an inland city removed from the Adriatic by six miles of mud . A dull hole , a city that must have driven such famous guests as Dante and Byron to drink and distraction . During the fifth century of our era it was more important than the New York of to-day , for it was the capital of the Roman Empire ? it harboured an enormous garrison and was the main naval base of that time , with the largest wharves and timber supplies . In 404 the Emperor decided that Rome was no longer safe . The barbarians were getting too powerful . And so he moved to the city in the sea ' where he had a much better chance to protect himself against surprise attacks . Here he and his descendants lived and ruled and loved , as you may see to this very day when you stand speechless before those incredible mosaics of that dark-eyed woman who started life as a dancing girl in the circus of Constantinople and died in an odour of sanctity as Theodora , the beloved wife of the famous Emperor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and turned into the capital of their newly founded empire . Then the lagoons began to fill up . Then Venice and the Pope fought for it . Then for a while it became the home of that pathetic exile , whose services to his native city of Florence had been rewarded by a threat of being burned at the stake . He spent silent hours among those famous pine forests that surrounded the city . Then he descended  | into his grave . And soon afterwards the famous old imperial residence followed his example . One more word about northern Italy . The kingdom has no coal but it has an almost unlimited supply of water-power . This water-power was just being harnessed when the Great War broke out . The next twenty years will see a tremendous development of this cheap form of electricity . The lack of raw materials will always remain a difficult problem . But with the proverbial industry of the average Italian citizen , his very sober mode of living , and his moderate needs , Italy will be a dangerous rival for other countries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the western side , the great plain of the Po is cut off from the Mediterranean by the Ligurian Alps , the connecting link between the Alps proper and the Apennines . The southern slopes of the Ligurian Alps , completely protected against the cold breezes from the north , form part of the famous Riviera , the winter playground of all Europe , or rather of that part of Europe which can afford a lengthy railway trip and fairly expensive hotels . Its chief city is Genoa , the chief port of the modern kingdom and a city of imposing marble palaces , relics of the day when Genoa was the most dangerous rival of Venice for the colonial spoils of the Near East . Towards the south of Genoa lies another small plain , that of the river Arno . The Arno takes its origin among the mountains about twenty-five miles north-east of Florence . It flows through the heart of that city which during the Middle Ages lay on the highroad that connected Rome , the centre of Christianity , with the rest of Europe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so cleverly that ere long it became the most important banking centre of the world . One family especially , that of the Medici , showed such brilliant gifts for that sort of work that they finally became hereditary rulers of the whole of Tuscany and were able to make their home town the most marvellous artistic centre of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries ,  | From 1865 to 1871 Florence was the capital of the new Italian kingdom . Then it dropped slightly back in importance , but it still is one of those places that one ought to see to appreciate how beautiful life can be if money and good taste happen to be present in a well-balanced ratio . Near the mouth of the Arno , which flows through one of the loveliest garden spots to be found anywhere outside the island of Java , are two cities which must be mentioned . One of these is Pisa , which wa first a Greek colony , then an important Etruscan city , then a great naval republic , holding sway over Corsica , Sardinia , and the Balearic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Florence . Its university was one of the most celebrated in medieval Europe . Pisa has a leaning tower which leans because the architects were not very careful in laying their foundations , but which proved very handy when Galileo wanted to study the habits of falling objects . The other city is Livorno , which for some curious reason we call Leghorn , and which is chiefly remembered as the town near which Shelley was drowned in the year 1822 . From Livorno southward the old stage-coach road as well as the modern railway keep close to the seashore . They give the traveller a quick but hazy glimpse of the island of Elba ( Napoleon 's place of exile until he unexpectedly reappeared in France to rush towards the final doom of Waterloo ) , and then enter the plain of the Tiber . This famous river , called the Tevere in Italian , is a sluggish and tawny current , vaguely reminiscent of the Chicago River but not quite so wide , and of the Spree in Berlin , but infinitely less clear . It takes its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to steal their wives . In prehistoric times its mouth was only twelve miles west of Rome . Since then it has added two miles to its length , for like the Po , the Tiber is a first-rate mud-carrier . The plain of the Tiber is different from that of the Arno . It is much wider and while the Arno region is healthy and highly fertile , that of the Tiber is barren and a breeder of disease . The very word malaria ' was coined here by those medieval pilgrims who were firmly convinced that the rnal aria ? the bad air ' ? was responsible for those  | dreadful attacks of fever which burned up the body while one was still alive . In consequence of this fear , all the houses in this neighbourhood were hermetically sealed as soon as the sun had set . This system of preventative hygiene had one great disadvantage . It kept all the little mosquitoes carefully indoors , but as we only learned about the relationship between malaria and mosquitoes some thirty years ago , we can hardly blame our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times this flat territory , the famous Campagna , was decently drained and fairly well populated . But because it lay open and unprotected along the shores of the Tyrrhenian Sea it was an ideal spot for the pirates who infested the whole of the Mediterranean as soon as the Roman policeman had disappeared . The towns were destroyed , the farms deserted , the drainage ditches neglected . Stagnant pools bred malaria mosquitoes and throughout the Middle Ages and even as late as thirty years ago , this entire region from the mouth of the Tiber to the Pontine marshes near Monte Circeo was either avoided or passed through as fast as the unfortunate horse could drag the rattling coach . Arises the question , Why should the most important city of the ancient world have been founded near a plague-spot ? Why indeed ? Rome was built where it was built , regardless of an unhealthy climate , scorching summers , chilly winters , and an absence of all decent communications . And yet it grew to be the centre of a world-wide empire , the holy shrine of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look for a single explanation . Look for a thousand different and inter-locking explanations . But do n't look for them here , for it would take as many as three volumes like the present one to get to the bottom of the secret . Nor shall I go into details about the city itself . For I am the last person in the world to do justice to the Eternal City of the eastern hemisphere . It may have been due to those rebellious ancestors of mine who from the year 50 before the birth of Christ until 165o of our own era felt themselves in the most cordial discord with everything that emanated from Rome . I ought to have wept , standing on the Forum , and I could only see the gangsters  | and racketeers who , under the name of the generals and party leaders , despoiled all of Europe and a greater part of Africa and Asia in exchange for those roads which seem to have been their eternal excuse for much that was unspeakably cruel . I ought to have felt a sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory and martyrdom , and I could only deplore the waste of so much money upon a building that had not a single claim to either beauty or charm except that it was bigger than any other edifice constructed for a similar purpose . And I longed for the harmony of Florence and Venice ? for the well-balanced proportions of Genoa . I know of course that I am particularly alone in these feelings . Petrarch , Goethe , everybody that ever amounted to something , has wept tears upon catching his or her first glimpse of Bramante 's dome . We will let it go at that , but rather than spoil your taste for a city you will some time see yourself , I duly note that Rome since the year 1871 is the capital of the kingdom of Italy and that it harbours a city within a city ? the so-called Vatican City ? which was surrendered to the Pope in the year 1930 and now gives the Pontiff that freedom of action which he had not enjoyed since that fateful day in September of 187o when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a constitution instead of that absolute sovereignty which had been the form of Roman government until then . The modern city of Rome has few industries . It has some terrible-looking monuments , a main street which reminds one of Philadelphia , and many people in uniforms . The uniforms are good . And that brings us to another city , until recently the most populous of the entire peninsula , which is a strange mixture of geography and history and which confronts us once more with that irritating puzzle : " Why did n't this city , enjoying every possible natural advantage , take the predominant place occupied by Rome situated in a dead alley on a mean little river ? " For Naples was right on the sea front at the head of a magnificent bay . It was older than Rome , and the territory around it was originally among the most fertile spots along the western  | Italian coast . Originally the Greeks , who founded Naples , had done their trading with the dangerous Apennine tribes from the safe distance of the island of Ischia . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever trembling with volcanic emotions , and the Greeks had moved to the mainland . The usual and apparently unavoidable quarrels between the colonists ( bored because far away from home and badly administered by grasping governors ) had caused civil strife , and three or four little settlements had been destroyed when a fresh batch of immigrants had decided to begin from the very beginning and had built themselves a town which they called New City ' or Neapolis , ' which eventually became Napoli , or in plain English , Naples . It was already a prosperous commercial centre when Rome was still a village inhabited by shepherds , and yet those shepherds must have had a veritable genius for administration , for already in the fourth century before our era Naples was an ally ' of Rome , an agreeable-sounding term , much less harsh than the word subject ' but describing the same sort of relationship . And from that time Naples played an inferior part , was afterwards overrun by whole hordes of barbarians and finally fell into the hands of one of the Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ byword for scandalous mis-management and suppression of every form of independent thought and action . Nevertheless , such were the town 's natural advantages that it became the most overcrowded city of the European continent . How all those people lived nobody knew and nobody cared , until the cholera epidemic of 1884 forced the modern kingdom to clean its house , which it has done with admirable intelligence and severity . The foreground of this marvellous spot is most appropriately occupied by the ornamental Vesuvius . Vesuvius is the neatest and most systematic of all the known volcanoes in the way it spreads its ashes . It rises up to a height of about 4000 feet and is entirely surrounded by lovely little villages which grow a particularly fiery wine , the famous Lacrima Christi . The ancestors of those villages already existed in Roman days . And why not ? Vesuvius was extinct . Since the memory of man , almost a thousand years ,  | there had not been an eruption . There had been vague rumblings in the bowels of the earth in the year 63 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The great surprise was sprung sixteen years later . In less than two days Herculaneum and Pompeii and a third smaller city were so deeply buried beneath deep layers of lava and ashes that they completely disappeared from the face of the earth . Thereafter , at least once every hundred years , Vesuvius gave signs of being far from extinct . The new crater , rising 1500 feet above the ruins of the original one , is for ever belching heavy clouds of smoke . And the statistics for the last 300 years ? 1631 , 1712 , 1737 , 1754 , 1779 , 1794 , 18o6 , 1831 , 1855 , 1872 , 1906 , etc. ? show that Naples is by no means sure of not being turned into another Pompeii . South of Naples we enter the province called Calabria . It suffers from the fact that it is so far away from the centre of the country . It has railway connexions with the north , but the coastal regions suffer from malaria , the central part is composed of granite , and agriculture is practised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republic . A narrow strait , the strait of Messina , separates Calabria from the island of Sicily . The strait , which is only a little over a mile wide , was famous in antiquity for the presence of two sea-monsters , called Scylla and Charybdis , that caused whirlpools which swallowed up whole ships if they ventured so much as half a yard out of their course . The fear those whirlpools aroused gives us an adequate idea of the helplessness of such ancient vessels , for a modern motor-boat putt-putts quietly right through the heart of these eddies without noticing that there is any commotion in the water . As for Sicily , its geographic position had made it the natural centre of the ancient world . Furthermore it enjoyed a delightful climate , was densely populated and highly fertile . But like Naples , life here was perhaps a little too good , a little too easy , a little too comfortable , for the Sicilians during more than two thousand long years submitted peacefully to every form of misgovernment that foreign potentates wished to bestow upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tortured by Phoenicians or Greeks or Carthaginians ( they were only about a hundred miles away from the northern coast of Africa ) or Vandals or Goths or Arabs or Normans or French or by any of the 120 princes , 82 dukes , 129 marquises , 28 counts and 356 barons who derived their titles from this happy island , they were repairing their houses from the damage done by the local volcano , Mt Etna . The eruption of the year 1908 , which completely destroyed the most important city , Messina , is still in everybody 's memory . It killed more than 75,000 people . The island of Malta is really a sort of suburb of Sicily and therefore ought to be mentioned here , although politically speaking it does not form part of Italy . It is a very fertile island and lies midway between Sicily and the coast of Africa . It dominates the trade-route from Europe to Asia by way of the Suez Canal . After the failure of the Crusades , it was presented to the knights of St John who thereupon called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1798 Napoleon took the island on his way to drive the English out of India via Egypt and Arabia ( a most ingenious plan which however failed ) . This was an excuse for the English to occupy it two years later and they have been there ever since , much to the chagrin of the Italians but not of the Maltese , who on the whole are better off than they would be under a Government of their own people . I have paid little attention to the east coast of Italy , but it is not very important . In the first place the Apennines used to reach almost as far as the shore , making large settlements very difficult . As the other side of the Adriatic was practically uninhabitable on account of the steepness of its hills , the development of trade was not encouraged . From Rimini in the north to Brindisi in the south ( from where the mail leaves for Africa and India ) there are no harbours of any importance . The heel of the boot is called Apulia . Like Calabria it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from civilization , and like Calabria its agricultural methods are those practised in the days when Hannibal honoured this region with his presence , waiting  | twelve long years for the help from Carthage that was never to come . There is a city in Apulia which enjoys one of the finest natural harbours in the world but which , alas , has no customers . It is called Taranto , and it gave its name to a particularly venomous sort of spider and to a dance by which the people who had been bitten by that spider were prevented from falling asleep and entering into a deadly coma . The Great War has made geography very complicated , for no account of modern Italy is complete without mention of the Istrian peninsula , which was given to the Italians in recognition of the fact that they had turned against their own allies and joined with the enemy . The city of Trieste was the principal export harbour of the old Austro-Hungarian Empire . Having lost its natural hinterland , it is not doing so well . And finally , tucked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is Fiume , another former possession of the Habsburgs . It was the natural outlet for the German people who had no other good port along the whole of the Adriatic coast . But fear that it might eventually be a rival of Trieste made the Italians clamour for Fiume . When the statesmen who concluded the Treaty of Versailles refused to give it to them , they simply took it , or rather , their poet d'Annunzio took it for them . Then the Allies turned it into a free state , ' but finally , after prolonged negotiations between Italy and Yugoslavia , it was ceded to Italy . That ends the present chapter , except for the island of Sardinia . This is really a very big island , but it is so far away and so few people visit it that we sometimes forget that it exists . But it does exist , the sixth biggest island of Europe , covering an area of almost i 0,000 square miles . Being the other extreme of that mountainrange of which the Apennines were part , it turns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has excellent harbours . The east coast is steep and dangerous and has not a single convenient landing place . During the last two centuries it has played a curious part in the history of Italy . Until the year 1708 it belonged to Spain . Then it fell into Austrian hands . In 1720 the Austrians swapped Sardinia against Sicily , which then belonged  | to the Dukes of Savoy , whose capital was the city of Turin , situated on the Po . Thereafter the Dukes of Savoy proudly called themselves Kings of Sardinia ( from duke to king is a decided step upward ) , and that is how the modern kingdom of Italy happened to grow out of a kingdom called after an island which not one Italian in a hundred thousand has seen .  | SPAIN , WHERE AFRICA AND EUROPE CLASHED THE people of the Iberian peninsula are famous for their very pronounced racial ' characteristics . The Spaniard is supposed to be so racially ' different from any other group of people that one will recognize him anywhere and under all circumstances by his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his sobriety , and his ability to play the guitar and the castanets . For even music has been dragged in to bolster up the racial theory . ' Perhaps so . Perhaps it is as easy to recognize the Spaniard by his haughtiness and pride as by his ability to play the guitar and the castanets . But I have very serious doubts upon the subject . The Spaniards merely took to playing the guitar and the castanets because in their dry and warm climate they were able to use out-of-door instruments . When it comes , however , to playing them really well , both Americans and Germans are greatly superior to the native talent . If they play them less frequently than the Spaniards do , that is the result of the climate under which they live . You ca n't very well play the castanets in the pouring rain of a cold Berlin evening nor the guitar when your fingers tremble with frostbite . And as for those qualities of pride and haughtiness and formal courtesy , were n't they all of them the result of centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life the direct outcome of the fact that Spain was , geologically speaking , quite as much a part of Africa as of Europe ? Therefore was n't it bound to be a " battlefield for Europeans and Africans until either one side or the other should have won ? In the end , the Spaniard was victorious , but the land for which he had been obliged to fight for such a long time had left its imprint upon him . What would he have developed into if his cradle had stood in Copenhagen or Berne ? Into a perfectly ordinary little Dane or Swiss .  | Instead of playing the castanets , he would have yodelled , because the steep walls of a mountain valley with their marvellous echoes invite one to yodel . And instead of living on a little dry bread and sour wine , raised with infinite care and patience on his own neglected soil ( neglected again on account of that clash between Africa and Europe ) , he would have eaten a lot of butter , necessary to protect his body against the eternal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aquavitx , because the abundant presence of cheap grain would have made alcoholic liquors the almost inevitable national beverage . And now look at the map . You remember the mountainranges of Greece and Italy . In Greece they ran diagonally across the country . In Italy they ran in an almost straight line from north to south , dividing the country into halves but allowing enough space on both sides for the construction of roads that coasted the country from one end to the other , while the salient of the Po plain made the Apennine peninsula an integral part of the European continent . In Spain the mountains make horizontal ridges which one might almost describe as visible degrees of latitude . After a single glance at the map you will understand how these mountain-ranges must have acted as barriers to any sort of orderly progress . They begin with the Pyrenees . The Pyrenees , 240 miles long , run in a straight and uninterrupted line from the Atlantic to the Mediterranean . They are not as high as the Alps and therefore it ought to be easier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is not so . The Alps , although very high , are also very wide , and the roads that run across them , although quite long , rise only very slowly and offer no special difficulties to either man or pack-horse . The Pyrenees , on the other hand , are only 6o miles wide , and as a result their mountain passes were much too steep for anybody except a goat or a mule . According to well-seasoned travellers , even the mules experienced difficulties . Trained mountaineers ( mostly professional smugglers ) were able to get through , but only during a few months of summer . The engineers who built the railways Caption  | connecting Spain with the rest of the world realized this , for they built the two trunk lines from Paris to Madrid and from Paris to Barcelona along the shores of the Atlantic and the Mediterranean . Whereas the Alps have half a dozen railway lines passing over them or under them , the Pyrenees , between Irun in the west and Figueras in the east , were not pierced by a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two tunnels was completed . After all , one ca n't very easily dig a tunnel sixty miles long . Neither can one send trains across a track with an inclination of forty degrees . There is one fairly easy pass in the west , the famous pass of Roncesvalles , where Roland , Charlemagne 's famous Paladin , died loyally serving his master 's interests until the moment he succumbed under the last of the Saracens ' attacks . Seven hundred years later , another army composed of Frenchmen used this pass as an entrance gate into Spain . They got across the pass itself but were stopped before Pamplona , the city that dominates the road on the southern side . During the siege , one of the Spanish soldiers ,  | a certain Ignatius de Loyola , was desperately wounded through a shot in the leg . While recovering , he had those visions which inspired him to found the Society of Jesus , the famous Order of the Jesuits . The Jesuits afterwards did more to influence the geographic development of a vast number of countries than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travellers , the Franciscans . It was here that the Order began . It was undoubtedly this inaccessibility of the Pyrenees which gave the famous Basque people their chance to maintain themselves from prehistoric times until to-day and which accounts for the independent Republic of Andorra , very high up in the eastern part of the mountains . The Basques , about 700,000 in number , inhabit a triangle that is bounded by the Gulf of Biscay in the north , by the Spanish province of Navarre in the east , while the western frontier follows a line from the city of Santander to the city of Logrono on the Ebro River . The name Basque ' means the same as our word Garcon , ' but it has nothing to do with the compatriots of the famous Captain d'Artagnan . The Roman conquerors called them Iberians and called the whole of Spain the Iberian peninsula . As for the Basques themselves , they proudly say that they are Eskualdunak , which sounds very unEuropean and quite like Eskimo . Just for good measure , and because your guess is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few of the current theories about the origin of the Basques . Some of the professors who distil racial theories out of skulls and gutturals , believe them to be connected with those Berbers whom I mentioned several chapters ago as the possible descendants of one of the earliest tribes of prehistoric Europeans , the so-called Cromagnon race . Others claim that they arc the survivors who saved themselves on the European continent when the romantic island of Atlantis disappeared beneath the waves of the ocean . Still others hold that they have always been where they are now and do n't bother to ask where they came from . Whatever the truth , the Basques have shown remarkable ability in keeping themselves aloof from the rest of the world . They are very industrious . More than a hundred thousand of  | them have migrated to South America . They are excellent fishermen and sailors and iron workers , and they mind their own business and keep off the front page of the newspapers . The most important city of their country is Vitoria , founded in the sixth century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ battle in which an Irishman called Arthur Wellesley , but better known by his English title of the Duke of Wellington , defeated the armies of a Corsican by the name of Buonaparte , but better known by his French title of the Emperor Napoleon , and forced the French to leave Spain for good and all . As for Andorra , this strange commonwealth numbering fully 5000 inhabitants , connected with the outside world by a bridlepath , is the only surviving specimen of those queer little medieval principalities which retained their independence because , as frontier posts , they might render valuable service to some distant monarch and because afterwards they were too far removed from the busy outside world to attract anybody 's attention . The capital has boo inhabitants , but the Andorrans , like the Icelanders and the people of San Marino in Italy , were ruling themselves according to their own desire at least eight hundred years before the United States started their experiment in applied democracy . In one other respect , the Pyrenees are quite different from the Alps . They have practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been covered more thickly with snow and ice than the Swiss mountains , but a few square miles of glacier are all that remain . The same holds true of practically all Spanish ridges . They are steep and difficult to cross . But even the Sierra Nevada , the range of southern Andalusia , only shows a few snow caps from October till March , if so long as that . The direction of the mountains was of course of immediate influence upon the Spanish rivers . They all of them start on or near the barren high plateau in the centre ? the remnant of a terrific mountain-range which has worn away in the course of millions of years , and they hasten to the sea , but at such speed and with so many waterfalls that none of them possesses the slightest value as a trade-route . Furthermore , the long dry summers deprive Caption  | them of most of their water , as you may see in Madrid , where the sandy bottom of the Manzanares provides the children of the capital with a nice imitation sea-shore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is why I wo n't even bother to tell you the names of most of them . The Tagus on which Lisbon , the Portuguese capital , is situated is an exception . It is navigable almost as far as the SpanishPortuguese frontier . The Ebro too in northern Spain , which runs through Navarre and Catalonia , can be used by smaller vessels , but larger ones have to pass most of the way through a canal which runs parallel with the river itself . The Guadalquivir ( Wadi-elKebir , or Big River of the Moors ) which connects Seville with the Atlantic Ocean can only be used by vessels that draw less than fifteen feet . Between Seville and Cordova , the famous Moorish capital that used to boast of no less than nine hundred public baths before the Christians captured it and reduced the population from 200,000 to 50,000 and the public baths from 900 to o , the Guadalquivir is only available for small vessels . After that it becomes what most Spanish rivers are , canyon rivers which are a great hindrance to overland trade while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Generally speaking , therefore , Nature was not particularly kind to the Spaniard . The great central part of the country consisted of a high plateau , divided into halves by a low mountain ridge . Old Castile is the name of the northern half and New Castile that of the other . The dividing ridge is called the Sierra de Guadarrama . The name Castile , ' which merely means castle , ' is a very pretty name . But it resembles those boxes of Spanish cigars of which the label is so much more imposing than the quality of the contents . For Castile is as harsh and ill-favoured a land as may be found anywhere . When General Sherman , after his march through Georgia , remarked that henceforth a crow wishing to cross the Shenandoah Valley would have to pack his own rations , he was consciously or unconsciously quoting a remark which the Romans made 2000 years before when they said that a nightingale trying to cross Castile would have to take its food and drink with  | it or it would die of hunger and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficiently high to prevent the clouds that arise from the Atlantic and the Mediterranean from reaching this unfortunate tableland . As a result , Castile suffers from nine months of inferno and during the other three months of the year it is exposed to the cold and dry winds which sweep across this treeless tract with such a merciless fury that sheep are the only animals that can live here with any degree of comfort , while the only plant that prospers is a variety of grass , the esparto or halfa grass , which is very tough and can therefore be used for basket-work . But most of this tableland , called the meseta by the Spaniards ( a word which you meet again in mesas , ' familiar to those who know New Mexico ) , is something that closely resembles a plain , ordinary desert , and that makes you understand why Spain and Portugal , although much larger than England , have only half the population of the British Isles . For further particulars about the shabby poverty of these regions , I refer you to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You may remember that the " ingenious hidalgo , " who was his hero , bore the proud name of Don Quixote de la Mancha . Well , Mancha was one of those inland deserts with which the plateau of Castile was dotted then as it is now , a bleak , inhospitable stretch of waste land near Toledo , the ancient Spanish capital . The name itself was ominous to Spanish ears , for in the original Arabic , al mansha , it meant wilderness , ' and the poor Don was really the Lord of the Wilderness . ' In a country like that , where Nature is both stingy and obstinate , Man must either settle down to hard labour and force her to yield him the necessities of life , or he can choose to live as the average Spaniard lives , who as a rule can load all the family possessions on the back of one very small donkey . And that brings us to one of the greatest tragedies that ever occurred as a result of a country 's unfortunate geographic position . Eight hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was not the first time the Iberian peninsula had been invaded . For the country possessed valuable mineral deposits . Two  | thousand years ago copper , zinc , and silver were what petroleum is to-day . Wherever copper , zinc , and silver were to be found , rival armies would fight for their possession . When the Mediterranean was divided into two great armed camps , and when the Semites ( of Carthage , a colony of the Phoenicians and ruthless in its exploitation of subject nations ) and the Romans ( not of Semitic origin but quite as ruthless in their exploitation of subject nations ) were throwing loaded dice ( one of the chief early uses made of lead was for the purpose of loading dice ) for the treasures of the world , Spain could not long escape her fate . Like many a modern land , unfortunately blessed with natural riches , Spain was turned into a battle-ground for the mercenaries of two large groups of organized brigands . As soon as they were gone , the country was used as a convenient land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into Africa . And then , early during the seventh century , a camel driver in Arabia had a vision and started a number of desert tribes , of whom no one had heard , on the war-path , bound for worlddomination . A century later they had conquered all northern Africa and were ready to tackle Europe . In the year 711 a certain Tarik sailed for the famous Monkey Rock ( the only spot in Europe where monkeys continued to live in a wild state ) and without meeting any opposition landed his troops near Gibraltar , the famous rock which during the last two hundred years has belonged to England . Thereafter the old Pillars of Hercules , the straits which Hercules had dug by the simple process of pushing the mountains of Europe and Africa aside , belonged to the Mohammedans . Could the Spaniards have defended themselves successfully against this invasion ? They tried to . But the geography of their country prevented any concerted action , for the mountain-ranges which ran a parallel course and the rivers with their deep canyons divided the country into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-day some 5000 Spanish villages have no direct communication with each other or any other part of the  | world except by a narrow track which pedestrians who do not suffer from dizziness may use during certain parts of the year . And then remember one of the few definite facts which history and geography teach us , that such countries are breeding places for clannishness . Now clannishness has undoubtedly certain good qualities . It makes the members of the same clan loyal to each other and loyal to the common or clan interests . But Scotland and the Scandinavian peninsula are there to show us that clannishness is the deadly enemy of all forms of economic co-operation and national organization . Island dwellers are supposed to be insular ' and to care for nothing except the affairs of their own little islet . But they at least can sit themselves down in a boat once in a while and spend an afternoon with their neighbours , or rescue the crew of a ship-wrecked vessel and hear what the big world is doing . The man of the valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassable mountain ridge , has no one but himself and his neighbours , and they in turn have no one but themselves and their neighbours . The conquest of Spain by the Mohammedans was possible because the Moors , although a desert people and therefore great worshippers of the restricted tribal ' idea , were for once united tinder strong leaders who had given them a common national purpose which made them forget their own petty ambitions . While the Spanish clans fought each one for itself and hated their rival clans as cordially as they hated the common enemy who was driving them out of house and home ( and often more so ) , the Mohammedans obeyed a single head . The seven centuries during which the great Spanish war of liberation lasted are an endless recital of treachery and rivalry between the little Christian states of the north that survived because the Pyrenees formed a barrier across which they could not hope to retreat without getting into trouble with the French , who , after a few vague gestures on the part of Charlemagne , had left them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned southern Spain into a veritable garden . These desert people appreciated the value of water , and they loved the flowers and trees which were so sadly  | lacking in their own part of the world . They constructed vast irrigation works and imported the orange , the date , the almond tree , sugar-cane , and cotton . They set the Guadalquivir to work to turn the valley between Cordova and Seville into one vast huerta or garden where the farmer was able to reap as many as four harvests every year . They tapped the Jucar River , which flows into the Mediterranean near Valencia , and added another 1200 square miles of fertile land to their possessions . They imported engineers , built universities where agriculture was scientifically studied , and constructed about the only roads the country possesses to this very day . What they did for the progress of astronomy and mathematics we have already seen in the first part of this book . And they were the only people in the Europe of that day who paid the slightest attention to medicine and hygiene @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they reintroduced the works of the ancient Greeks into the west by means of their own Arabic translations . And they set another force to work which was to be of tremendous value to them . Instead of shutting the Jews up in ghettos or worse , they gave them free rein to develop their great commercial and organizing power for the benefit of the country at large . And then the inevitable happened . Almost the whole of the country had been conquered , and there was little danger from the side of the Christians . Other Arab and Berber tribes , thirsting in their miserable deserts , heard news of this terrestrial Paradise . And since Mohammedan rule was autocratic , the success or failure of that rule depended upon the ability of a single person . Amid these luxurious surroundings , dynasties founded by strong-armed ploughboys degenerated and became weak . Other strong-armed ploughboys , still sweating behind their oxen , cast envious eyes upon the joys of the Alhambra of Granada and the Alcazar of Seville . There were civil wars . There was murder . Whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Meanwhile , in the north the strong man had made his appearance . Clans were being combined into tiny principalities . Tiny principalities were being combined into small states . The Catholic banner was unfurled . Men began to hear the names of Castile  | and Leon and Aragon and Navarre . Finally they forgot their ancient rivalries long enough to marry Ferdinand of Aragon with Isabel of Castile , the land of the castles . During this great war of liberation ? Catholic against Moor ? over three thousand pitched battles were fought . The Church turned the racial struggle into a conflict of religious aspirations . The Spaniard became the soldier of the Cross ? a most noble ambition which was to bring ruin to the country for which he so valiantly fought . For in the same year that the last of the Moorish strongholds , Granada , was taken from the Moors , Columbus discovered the road to America . Six years later Vasco da Gama sailed round the Cape and found the direct route to the Indies . Therefore , just at the moment when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and should have continued to develop those latent natural forces of his country which had been set into motion by the Moors , he came into easy money . His religious feeling of exaltation made it easy for him to imagine himself a holy missionary when in reality he was nothing but an uncommon ( because uncommonly brutal and greedy ) brigand . In 1519 he conquered Mexico . In 1532 he conquered Peru . After that he was lost . All further ambitions were drowned in the steady flow of gold which the cumbersome galleons dumped into the storehouses of Seville and Cadiz . No man would disgrace himself working with his hands when he could belong to the gold collar class ' by demanding his share of the Aztec and Inca plunder . All the painful work of the Moors became undone . The Moors themselves were forced to leave the country . Next the Jews went , thrown wholesale into filthy vessels to carry them , naked and deprived of all their possessions , wherever it pleased the captain of the ship to put them on land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their sufferings , they struck back at their tormenters , had a hand in every heretical enterprise that was directed against the hated name of Spain . But even Providence must take a hand and give these unfortunate sufferers of the Golden Illusion a monarch whose view of life did not extend beyond the cloistered cell he erected for himself in the palace of  | the Escurial , situated on the outskirts of the bleak Castilian plain , to which he had transferred his new capital city of Madrid . Henceforth the riches of three continents and the man-power of an entire nation were to be used to curb the aggressions of the unbelievers , the Protestants of the north , the Mohammedans of the south . The Spanish people , changed by seven centuries of religious warfare into a race in whose eyes the supernatural had become the natural , willingly obeyed their royal master . And they bled to death in the attempt just as they impoverished themselves by growing too rich . The Iberian peninsula made the Spanish people what they are to-day . Can the Spanish people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iberian peninsula into what they want it to be , regardless of the past and with only an eye to the future ? They are trying , and in some cities they are trying very hard . But what a job ! What a job !  | FRANCE , THE COUNTRY THAT HAS EVERYTHING SHE WANTS WE often hear it said that France does not consider herself a part of the rest of the world , that the French people , who live on a continent , are infinitely more insular ' than their English neighbours who dwell in rainy solitude on an island ; in short , that the French , by their persistent and systematic refusal to take any interest , however slight , in the affairs of this planet , are the most selfish and self-centred of all nations and are at the bottom of most of our present troubles . Well , in order to understand things thoroughly , we must go down to their roots . The roots of any given people are situated deep down in the soil and in the soul . The soil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil . We can not understand the one without understanding the other . But when we have grasped the true inner meaning of both , we have a key to the character of almost any nation . Most of the accusations we hear so often uttered against the French are based upon the truth . But so was that unbounded and unquestioning praise heaped upon them during the days of the Great War , for both their virtues and their defects grew directly out of the geographic position of their country . It had made them self-centred and self-contented , because the land they occupied between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean was absolutely self-sufficient for their needs . Why go abroad for changes of climate or changes in scenery when you can find all of those in your own backyard ? Why travel all over the globe to study differences of language and habits and customs when a few hours in a train will carry you from the twentieth to the twelfth century or from a smiling , verdant country of castles to  | the magnificent mysteries of a land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about passports or letters of credit and bad food and sour wine and the dull , stodgy faces of frozen northern peasants when your own food and drink and beds and conversation are about as good as any this vale of tears can provide , when you live in a land where ( believe it or not ! ) they can make spinach a dish fit for human consumption ? Of course a poor Swiss , who has never seen anything except a mountain , or a poor Dutchman , who has never seen anything except a flat piece of green meadow with a few black and white cows , must go abroad once in a while or he would die of boredom . A German will sooner or later tire of his exclusive diet of excellent music interspersed with indifferent sausage-sandwiches . An Italian can not live on spaghetti all his life long . And a Russian must crave an occasional meal without standing six hours in line for half a pound of oleomargarine . But the Frenchman , lucky devil , lives in an earthly paradise where all things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cars , and therefore he will ask you , " Why should I stir from my own country ? " You may answer that this is a hopelessly one-sided point of view and that my Frenchman is all wrong . I wish I could agree with you , but I am forced to aver that France in many respects is a country singularly blessed by Nature and its general geographical background . In the first place , France has every sort of climate . It has a temperate climate . It has a hot climate . It has a medium climate . France is the proud possessor of the highest mountain in Europe . At the same time , the French have been able to connect all the industrial centres of their land with canals that run through absolutely flat country . If a Frenchman likes to spend his winter sliding down the slopes of a hill , he moves to a village in the Savoy in the western branch of the Alps . Does he prefer swimming to ski-ing , all he need do is to take a ticket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean . And should he be of a particular curiosity about men and women , should he interest himself in the outward aspect of monarchs in exile and  | exiles about to turn monarchs , of actors with a future before them and actresses with a future behind them , of fiddle virtuosos or paragons of the piano , of dancers who have lightly upset a couple of thrones , and all the other great little people who are in the limelight , he need merely take a chair in the Cafe de la Caption Paix , and order himself a glass of coffee and cream , and wait . Sooner or later every man , woman , or child who has filled the front page of the world 's newspapers will pass that corner . And what is more , they will pass that corner without attracting any particular attention . Here we come upon one of the unanswerable mysteries of political geography . Two thousand years ago most of the territory  | that flies the Republican tricolour ( and flies it day and night , for the French , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down until time and the weather have reduced it to unrecognizable shreds ) was part of the great western European plain and there was no earthly ( that is to say , geographic ) reason why some day this land between the Atlantic and the Mediterranean should become the home of one of the most highly centralized nations of the world . There is a school of geography which holds that climate and geographical background play the decisive part in shaping human destinies . Undoubtedly they do ? sometimes . Quite as often they do not . The Moors and the Spaniards lived on the same soil and the sun shone with the same violence upon the valley of the Guadalquivir in the year 1200 as it did in the year 1600 . But in the year 1200 it bestowed its blessings upon a paradise of fruit and flowers and in the year 1600 it forced its accursed rays upon a parched wilderness of neglected irrigation ditches and weeds . And so it goes on . Human nature , regardless of the advance of the machine and of science and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unstable and undependable factor in the general scheme of things . It has been responsible for the many strange and unexpected developments of which the map of the world is the living evidence ; and France is merely one of the object lessons which bear me out on this point . Politically speaking , France seems to be one country . But if you will kindly look at the map you will notice that France is really composed of two separate parts which actually turn their backs upon each other ? the valley of the Rhone in the southeast which looks out upon the Mediterranean , and the great inclined plain of the north and the west which faces towards the Atlantic . Let us begin with the oldest of these two halves . The Rhone takes its origin in Switzerland but it really does not become a river of any importance until it has left the Lake of Geneva and has reached the city of Lyons , the centre of the French silk industry , where it combines with the Saone , a river which comes down from the north @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from that of the Meuse , a river which is as intimately connected with the history of northern Europe as the Saone ( combined with the Rhone ) is with that of the south . The Rhone is not a very navigable river . Before it reaches the Gulf of Lions ( no , the name Gulf of Lyons ' which appears on many maps is an error ) it has come down some 6000 feet , which accounts for its rapid currents , which have not yet been entirely overcome by the modern steamer . Nevertheless it offered the ancient Phoenicians and Greeks a convenient entrance way into the heart of Europe , for man-power ? slave-power ? was cheap . The ships could be dragged upstream ( with infinite labour ) and downstream was a matter of a few days . And so it happened that the old civilization of the Mediterranean made its first attack upon the European hinterland by way of the Rhone valley . Strangely enough Marseilles , the earliest commercial settlement in that region ( and still the most important French port on the Mediterranean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the river but several miles towards the east . ( It is now connected with the Rhone by means of a canal . ) Nevertheless it proved a very good choice , for Marseilles became such an important centre of trade that as early as the third century before Christ Marseillian coins had found their way as far as the Austrian Tyrol and the region round Paris . And soon the whole region immediately to the north of it recognized Marseilles as its capital . Then , during an ill-fated moment in its history , the citizens of the town , hard pressed by wild tribes from the Alps , asked the Romans to come and help them . The Romans came , and , as was their habit , stayed . All the land along the mouth of the Rhone became a Roman provincia and the name Provence , ' which has played such a great part in history , bears silent testimony to the fact that it was the Romans , rather than the Phoenicians and Greeks , who recognized the importance of this fertile triangle . But here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most perplexing problems both of geography and history . The Provence with its mixture of Greek and Roman civilization , its  | ideal climate , its great fertility , its front door opening upon the Mediterranean and its back door leading conveniently to the plain of central and northern Europe , seemed predestined to become the logical successor to Rome . It was given every possible natural advantage and then , with all the trump cards in its hands , it failed to play them . During the quarrels between Caesar and Pompey , the Provence took the side of Pompey , and the rival gang destroyed the city of Marseilles . But that was a minor incident , for soon afterwards its citizens were doing business once more at the same old stand , while literature and courtly manners and the arts and sciences , no longer safe in Rome , fled across the Ligurian Sea and turned the Provence into an island of civilization entirely surrounded by barbarians . When the Popes with all their wealth and power were no longer able to maintain themselves in the city of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the town famous for the first attempt at bridge-building on a large scale ( part of the bridge now lies on the bottom of the river , but in the twelfth century it was one of the world 's wonders ) and where they owned a castle that could withstand a hundred sieges . Thereupon for nearly seventy years the Provence was the home of the head of Christendom , its knights took a very prominent part in the Crusades , and one noble Provencal family became the hereditary ruler of Constantinople . But somehow or other the Provence was never able to play the part for which Nature seemed to have predestined her when she created these delightful and fertile and romantic valleys . The Provence gave us the Troubadours , but even they , although recognized as the founders of a form of literature which has maintained itself ever since in our novels and our plays and our poetry , were never able to make their soft Provencal dialect , the langue d'oc , the general tongue of all France . It was the north with its langue d'oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or yes ) ? it was the north , which enjoyed none of the natural advantages of the south , which was to found the French State , create the French nation , and bestow upon the world in general the manifold blessings of French culture . But sixteen centuries  | ago no one could have foreseen this development . For then the entire plain which reaches from the Pyrenees in the south to the Baltic in the north seemed predestined to become part of a vast Teutonic empire . That would have been the natural development . But man not being very much interested in natural developments , everything came differently . To the Romans of Caesar 's time all this part of Europe had been the Far West . They had called it Gallia because it was inhabited by Gauls , by people belonging to the mysterious race of fair-haired men and women to whom the Greeks had given the general name of Keltoi or Celts . And in those days there were two kinds of Gaul . One was the region of the Po river , between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made their appearance at a very early date and which was known as Gallia Cisalpina or **31;1238;TOOLONG . That was the Gaul which Caesar left when he threw his famous die and boldly crossed the Rubicon . Then there was the Gallia Transalpina , the **25;1271;TOOLONG , and that accounted vaguely for all the rest of Europe . But after Caesar 's famous expedition of the years 58 ? 51 B.C. it came to be associated more particularly with the France of to-day . It was a fertile land which could be made to pay taxes without too much objection on the part of the natives , hence an ideal domain for intensive Roman colonization . The mountains , well provided with passes , as they are , offered no great difficulties to the progress of an army consisting mostly of infantry . Soon the great plain of France was dotted with Roman fortresses and Roman villages , markets , temples , prisons , theatres and factories . A small island in the river Seine , where the Celts still lived on houses built on piles , and called Lutetia ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possession of this natural fortress ) , became an ideal spot on which to build a temple dedicated to Jupiter . That temple stood where NotreDame rises to-day . As the island had direct water communication with Great Britain ( a profitable Roman colony during the first 400 years of our era ) and was an excellent strategic centre from which to watch  | the turbulent regions between the Rhine and the Meuse , it quite naturally developed into the chief centre of the vast Roman organization that administered the Far West . As I told you in the chapter on maps , we sometimes wonder how the Romans were able to find their way across the whole island and mainland world of that day , but there can be no question about it ? they had an unerring instinct for the right spot , whether they were building a harbour , a fortress , or a trading-post . A casual observer , after passing six dreary weeks amid the rains Caption and fogs of the Parisian valley , may ask himself , " Why in the name of Mars did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative headquarters for all their western and northern possessions ? " But a geologist with a map of northern France before him could show us . In the course of millions of years the sea alternately invaded this land basin and slowly withdrew from it . Each time large deposits collected in the bed of the sea , first hard limestone , then later on chalk , sands and clays , more limestone and more sands in succession . The edges of these layers of rock have worn away , so that they now are exposed lying on each other something like the saucers of one of those Chinese tea-sets which used to delight the hearts of our grandmothers . The lowest and biggest of these saucers stretches from the Vosges Mountains to Brittany , where its western brim lies buried beneath the waters of the English Channel . The second one reaches from Lorraine to the  | coast of Normandy . The third one , the famous Champagne region , encircles the fourth one , appropriately called the Ile de France , or the Island of France . This island @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heart of it . That meant safety ? almost complete safety ? because it offered the greatest amount of protection from foreign invasion . For the enemy was obliged to storm the steep outer edges of those saucers , while the home troops were not only in an excellent position for defence but in case of defeat could leisurely withdraw to the protection of the next saucer-rim , and could repeat that performance four times ere they had reached their little island in the Seine , which , by the burning of the few connecting bridges , could be turned into an impregnable fortress . It was of course possible for a very determined and wellequipped hostile force to take Paris . But it was exceedingly difficult , as the Great War has shown us only recently . It was not only the valour of the French and British that kept the Germans out of the French capital . It also was that geographical accident of millions of years ago which had put every possible natural barrier in the way of the invaders from the east . France has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independence . But whereas most countries have been under the necessity of guarding separate frontiers , France was able to devote all her energies to the protection of her eastern boundaries ; and this probably accounted for the fact that France Caption  | could develop into a highly centralized modern State long before any of the other nations of Europe . The whole of the western part of France , situated between the Cevennes and the Vosges and the Atlantic , falls quite naturally into a number of peninsulas and valleys which are separated from each other by low ridges . The valley of the Seine and Oise is connected with the plains of Belgium through a natural gateway defended since time immemorial by the city of St Quentin . In modern times it has become a very important railway centre , and as such it was one of the main German objectives during the march on Paris in 1914 . The valley of the Seine and that of the Loire are in easy communication with each other by way of the gap of Orleans . As a result thereof that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the history of France . In the Middle Ages , knights in armour fought for such key positions . To-day railway companies fight for such key positions . The world changes . But often enough , the more it seems to change , the more it really remains the same . As for the connexion between the Loire valley and the valley of the Garonne , it followed the present railway line via Poitiers , and it was near Poitiers that Charles Martel in the year 732 prevented the Moors from pushing any further into Europe , and it was near Poitiers that the Black Prince in the year 1356 so completely annihilated the French forces that France remained under English domination for almost another hundred years . As for that wide valley of the Garonne , the southern part of which is that famous land of Gascony whence came the dashing d'Artagnan and the gallant King Henry IV , that part of France is in direct communication with the Provence and the Rhone valley by way of a valley that runs from Toulouse on the Garonne River to Narbonne , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the oldest of all Roman settlements in Gaul . Like all such prehistoric highways ( for that route was used thousands of years before the beginning of written history ) it has always been a source of revenue to some one . Racketeering  | and profiteering are as old as the human race . If you doubt this statement , go to any mountain pass in any part of the world and remain in that neighbourhood until you have definitely located the spot where the road was at its narrowest a thousand years ago . On that exact spot you will find the ruins of from half a dozen to two dozen castles , and if you know anything about ancient civilizations , the different layers of stone will tell you : " Here in the year 50 B.C. and in the year 600 and 800 and in 1too and in 125o and in 1350 and in 1500 some robber baron built himself a fortress which allowed him to demand tribute from all passing caravans . " Sometimes you will be surprised to find a flourishing city instead of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and bastions of Carcassonne will tell you how terribly strong such a mountain pass fortress had to be to survive the attacks of all its hungry enemies . So much for the general landscape of France . Now let me add a few very general characteristics about the people who live in this land between the Mediterranean and the Atlantic . There is one thing they seem to have in common , a certain sense of balance and proportion . I should almost feel inclined to say that the French tried hard to be logical , ' if that unfortunate word were not so closely connected with the idea of something dry and dull and pedantic . It is true that France is the home cf the highest mountain in Europe . The top of Mount Blanc is now French territory , but that is merely an accident . The average Frenchman is as little concerned about that waste of snow and ice as the average American is about the Painted Desert . What he likes best is the harmonious roll of the hills of the Meuse region and Guyenne and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high poplars , and their leisurely barges , the haze that hangs over the valleys at night and then turns them into paintings by Corot . What he knows best are those little villages where nothing ever changes ( the greatest strength of any country ) , those small towns in which the people live or at least try to live as their ancestors  | did fifty or five hundred years ago , and Paris , where the best living and the best thinking have gone hand in hand for more than ten centuries . For the Frenchman is not a sentimental dreamer , but a most intelligent and eager realist . He stands with both feet flatly on this earth . He realizes that he will live but once and that threescore and ten is all he can expect . And so he endeavours to make Caption himself as comfortable as possible while on this planet and wastes no time imagining the world better than it is . C'est la vie ? such is life ? and suppose we make the best of it ! Since food is agreeable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the knowledge of good cooking . Since wine , ever since the days of our Saviour , has been regarded as a fit drink for true Christians , let us cultivate the best of wines . Since the Lord in His wisdom has seen fit to fill this earth with many things agreeable to the eye and the ear and the nose , let us not indulge in a haughty denial of these divine bounties , but partake of them as an all-wise Providence  | has evidently meant us to do . And since Man is stronger when fighting in a group than when acting alone , let us stick closely to the family as the elementary social unit which is responsible for the weal and woe of all its members , just as all the individual members are responsible for the weal and woe of the family . This is the ideal side of French life . There is another side , much less agreeable , which however grows directly out of the very qualities which I have just enumerated . The family quite frequently ceases to be a pleasant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandfathers who rule the clan act as a brake which prevents all progress . The excellent habit of saving for sons and grandsons and great-grandsons degenerates into a hideous habit of scraping and filching and rooking and pinching and economizing on every necessity of life , including that charity towards one 's neighbour without which civilized existence becomes a very drab experience indeed . But by and large the average Frenchman , of however humble rank or station , seems to carry with him a certain practical philosophy of life which provides him with a maximum of content at a minimum of expenditure . For one thing , he is not ambitious in our sense of the word . He knows that all men are born unequal . They tell him that in America every boy may some day hope to become a president of the bank for which he works as a clerk . What of it ? He does not want to assume all that responsibility ! What would become of his three hours for luncheon ? It would of course be nice to have all the money that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and happiness would be too great . And so the Frenchman works and works industriously and his wife works and his daughters and his sons work too , yes , and the whole country works and saves and lives the sort of lives it likes to live and does not try to lead the sort of lives other people think it ought to like to live ; and that is a bit of wisdom which does not make for great riches , but which is a better guarantee for ultimate happiness than the doctrine of success preached all over the rest of the world . Whenever we come to the sea in this geography of ours I shall  | not tell you that the people of the coast indulge in fishing . Of course they do . What else would you expect them to do ? But when we reach the subject connected with agriculture , we shall make a very curious discovery . Whereas in most countries the population during the last hundred years has been attracted to the cities , fully sixty per cent . of all Frenchmen continue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working the fields are gradually making way before the improved methods of modern science , and when the French peasant shall have ceased to till his soil as his great-great-grandfather did in the days of Charlemagne and Clovis , France will be entirely self-supporting . What helps to keep the peasant on the land is the fact that as a rule he is his own proprietor . His farm may not be much of a farm but it is his own . In England and in east Prussia , two parts of the Old World where there is a great deal of agriculture , the farms often belong to some vague and distant landlord . But the French Revolution did away with the landlord , whether noble or cleric , and divided his property among the small peasantry . That was often very hard on the former proprietors . But their ancestors had acquired those possessions by right of eminent plunder , so what was the difference ? And it has proved of tremendous advantage to the country at large . For it gives more than half of the people a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like everything else , that state of affairs probably has its disadvantages . It may account for the exaggerated feeling of nationalism among the French . It may explain the provincialism which makes every Frenchman stick to the people of his own village even when he moves to Paris , so that Paris is full of little hotels catering for certain groups of regional travellers . It also explains his utter unwillingness to migrate to other parts of the world , but then again , why should anyone move to another country when he is perfectly happy at home ? Next to agriculture , the cultivation of the wine-grape keeps vast numbers of Frenchmen attached to the soil . The entire valley of the Garonne is devoted to the culture of the vine . The city of Bordeaux near the mouth of the Garonne and just north of those  | vast silty plains called the Landes , where the shepherds walk on stilts and the sheep can remain out of doors all the year long , is the centre for the export of this wine , as Cette , on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piping hot valley of the Rhone . The wines from Burgundy ? the so-called Cote d'Or ? are gathered together in Dijon , while those of the Champagne are assembled ( and multiplied and divided ) in the ancient French coronation city of Rheims . When grain and wine fail to support the population , industry helps out . The French monarchs were something more than haughty imbeciles who oppressed their subjects and wasted useless millions on the pretty ladies of Versailles . They made their Courts the centre of fashion and civilized living towards which all the world flocked to learn agreeable manners and to be taught the difference between eating and dining . As a result , even to-day , a century and a half after the last of the ancient rulers was thrown into the quick-lime of a Paris potter's-field , with his head between his feet , Paris dictates to the feminine part of the world what to wear and how to wear it . The industries which provide Europe and America with those indispensable luxuries which most people prefer to the sheer necessities , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give employment to millions of women and girls . The endless flower fields of the Riviera are the original source whence flows most of our expensive perfumery . Then came the discovery of coal and iron in the soil of France , and Picardy and Artois grew drab and ugly with those vast dumpheaps of cinders and slag which played such a great part during the battle of Mons , where the English tried to stop the Germans in their march upon Paris . Lorraine became the centre of the iron industry . The central plateau made steel . When the war was over the French hastened to annex Alsace , which provided them with more steel and which , during the last fifty years of German domination , had gone in heavily for textiles . As a result of this recent development , one-quarter of the French people are to-day engaged in industries , and they can proudly boast that their industrial cities are fully as hideous , as unattractive and as inhuman in their outer aspect as those of England or America .  | BELGIUM , A COUNTRY CREATED @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consists of three parts : the plain of Flanders along the shores of the North Sea , the low plateau between Flanders and the uplands of the east , rich in iron and coal , and the Ardennes upland of the east , through which the Meuse flows in pleasant curves , bound for the marshes of the Low Countries a short distance further towards the north . The iron and coal deposits centring around the cities of Liege , Charleroi , and Mons ( the Great War had a strange habit of bringing the names of coal and iron cities to the front pages of our newspapers ) are so plentiful that probably Belgium will be able to provide the world with those two necessities of modern life for long to come although the mines become increasingly difficult to work . But this country , blessed with what the Germans so often call the heavy industry , ' has curiously enough no good modern harbours of its own . The coast along the Channel , shallow and protected by a most complicated arrangement of sandbanks and shallow places , has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dug artificial harbours in Ostend and Zeebrugge and Nieuwport , but Antwerp , her most important harbour , lies forty miles distant from the North Sea , and the river Scheldt for the last thirty miles of its course runs through Dutch territory , a slightly absurd arrangement and one which might be called unnatural ' from a geographic point of view but unavoidable in a world ruled by scraps of paper signed by delegates to solemn international conferences . As however Belgium is a country that was the direct outcome of a number of such conferences , we ought to know something about the historical antecedents that faced their  | Excellencies whenever they settled comfortably round their green tables to decide the fate of the world . The Gallia Belgica of the Romans was inhabited by Celtic and Germanic tribes , warlike people who retained many of their ancient customs while adopting some of the outer trappings of Roman civilization . Rome kept on thrusting northward from the wooded hills of the Ardennes across the table-lands of what is now called Belgium till she reached the almost impassable marshes that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the break up of the Roman Empire these provinces were for a time included in the dominions of Charlemagne , the great , golden-bearded Emperor of the Franks . His grandson , Charles the Bald , the same who allowed the Norse seafarers to peg out a claim in Normandy , entered into an agreement with his brothers Lothair and Ludwig , at Verdun in 843 , by which the former Gallia Belgica became a part of Lothair 's inheritance . After remaining more or less under German suzerainty for three centuries it began to split up into little duchies and principalities and bishoprics , each more or less independent , all jealous of their neighbours , all rather frightened of France . The soil was rich , though the coalfields of the western marshes had n't yet been opened up ; the people were industrious ; the various rulers had the good sense ? not too common in those days ? to encourage merchants and foster trade . Out of those lands John the Good of France carved the dukedom of Burgundy , with which he invested his favourite son @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own death as a prisoner of war in London . Philip , who had won his nickname of the Bold ' at the battle of Poitiers , married Margaret of Flanders , who , as her dowry , brought him a great slice of Flemish territory , well garnished with flourishing cities . So bit by bit the duchy of Burgundy grew , until it covered practically all the ground included in Holland and Belgium to-day ? and a bit over . Those were golden days for the weavers of Ghent and Bruges , Malines and Mons. You can still see ? where the Great War has spared what five centuries had n't wiped out ? the noble halls built by the trade-guilds , and the beautiful belfries raised by wealthy burghers to the glory of God . You can see in many picture galleries old  | Flemish paintings showing those men in their habit as they lived , shrewd , sturdy , broad-built , with their angular white-coifed wives ; you can see the Dukes who ruled over them , long-nosed , loose-lipped Philip , grandson of the Bold , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Good , ' and his red-haired , squareshouldered son and successor , Duke Charles , who certainly did deserve to go down to history as the Bold . ' But poor Charles pitted his bluff wits against one of the cleverest and most cunning monarchs that ever sat on the throne of France , Louis XI , and their long-drawn-out quarrel , waged chiefly over certain towns on the river Somme which had been pledged to one party by the other , ended with Charles 's death at the battle of Nancy in 1477 . Louis XI was not unnaturally anxious to dispose of the hand of the dead Duke 's daughter Mary , but instead of the French prince , for whom he designed her , she elected to wed a Habsburg , Maximilian of Austria . From him their descendants inherited the famous jutting Habsburg underlip ; from her , a considerable part of what is now Belgium and Holland . Those portions of the dukedom of Burgundy which lay nearest to the French frontier and had formed the original French gift reverted before long to the French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's grandson , the Emperor Charles V. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Low Countries ? by which we mean Flanders and the Netherlands ? flourished exceedingly . Medieval ships had a comparatively small draught , and many towns now far from the reach of mercantile vessels were centres of sea-borne commerce . Then the currents gradually shifted in the North Sea , and the harbours of Bruges and Ghent gut silted up , and the face of the land slowly changed until it became that picturesque and placid holiday haunt we see to-day , a land of white-washed farms and grey cathedrals and quiet streets where artists plant their easels and grass grows between the cobblestones , and human nature aided the shifting sea-currents in bringing this about : for the trade-guilds were unwise . They challenged the power of the last Burgundian Dukes , who avenged themselves all too well upon their rebellious subjects . The Reformation did the rest . For Flanders after a short and  | very sharp upheaval in favour of the Lutheran doctrines remained faithful to the Mother Church . And when their northern @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last remaining port of their old rival , and with Antwerp cut off from the rest of Europe , the whole of Belgium went into a pro-Caption longed period of hibernation , out of which she did not arise until the needs of James Watt 's hungry machines drew the world 's attention to her immense riches in natural materials . Then foreign capital hastened to the valley of the Meuse , where there are rich deposits of coal , and in less than twenty years Belgium had become one of the leading industrial nations of Europe . It was then that the Walloon or French-speaking part of Caption  | the country ( everything west of Brussels ) came fully into its own , for although it contained only 42% of the total population it soon became by far the richest part of the whole country . To make matters still a little more complicated the Congress of Vienna of 1815 , which was supposed to settle the peace of the world for all time ( a sort of Versailles of a century ago ) , had seen fit to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a powerful northern balance against the French . The end of this strange political marriage came in 1830 when the Belgians rose against the Dutch , and the French ( as was to be expected ) rushed to their assistance . The Great Nations ( a little late as usual ) interfered . A prince of the house of Coburg , uncle of Queen Victoria ( Uncle Leopold was a very serious gentleman who exercised a very profound influence upon his dear little niece ) , was made King of the Belgians . He had just refused a similar offer from the Greeks and never had any reason to regret his choice . For the new kingdom proved to be a success . The mouth of the Scheldt remained in Dutch hands , but Antwerp became once more one of the most important harbours of western Europe . The Great European Powers had officially proclaimed Belgium a neutral power . ' But King Leopold ( the son of the founder of the dynasty ) was much too shrewd to have any confidence in such paper keep-off-the-grass signs . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third-rate little nation , existing merely by the grace of its richer neighbours . When a certain gentleman by the name of Henry Stanley returned from the heart of Africa , Leopold prevailed upon him to come to Brussels and out of this interview grew the International Association of the Congo , which in course of time was to make Belgium one of the largest colonial Powers of the modern world . To-day the main problem before Belgium , with its magnificent geographic situation right in the heart of the most prosperous part of northern Europe , is no longer an economic one . It is a racial one . The Flemish majority is rapidly catching up with the French minority in the matter of general education and scientific and cultural development . It is clamouring for a share in the administration of the country from which it has been kept separated ever  | since the founding of the independent kingdom . It insists upon absolute equality for both languages . But I had better leave this subject . It puzzles me , and I fail to see why it should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ origin and share almost twenty centuries of common history . Yet they live like cats and dogs . In the next chapter we shall meet the Swiss , who in various parts of their country speak four different languages , German , French , Italian , and Romansh ( a strange Roman tongue surviving among the mountains of the Engadine ) , and they get along with each other without any real basic friction . There must be a reason for this difference , but I for one am willing to confess that it surpasses my understanding .  | LUXEMBURG , THE HISTORICAL CURIOSITY BuT ere I talk of Switzerland I ought to mention a curious little independent principality , the name of which would hardly be known if it had not played quite an important role during the first days of the World War . Luxemburg ( the liitzel or little ' burg ) counts over one quarter of a million inhabitants , whose ancestors lived in this neighbourhood when it was still part of the Roman province of Gallia Belgica . It was however of considerable importance during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was supposed to be one of the impregnable fortresses of the world . That fact and the jealousy between France and Prussia as to who should own it made the Congress of Vienna of 1815 give the tiny country status as a Grand Duchy of which the kings of the Netherlands should be the personal rulers to compensate them for the loss of their ancestral territories in Germany , and include it in the Germanic Confederation . Twice during the nineteenth century the small duchy almost caused a war between Germany and France . In order to prevent further difficulties of that sort , the fortifications were finally dismantled , and Luxemburg was officially declared to be neutral territory ? like Belgium . When the war broke out , the Germans violated this neutrality , basing their decision to do so upon the geographical necessity of invading France by way of the flat plains of the north-east without trying the hopeless expedient of forcing the steep tea-cup barriers of the east . ( See France . ) Luxemburg remained in German hands until 1918 . Even now the small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil contains a considerable amount of iron ore . But for the present the trade of the duchy is protected by an agreement with Belgium .  | SWITZERLAND , THE COUNTRY OF HIGH MOUNTAINS , EXCELLENT SCHOOLS , AND A UNIFIED PEOPLE WHO SPEAK FOUR DIFFERENT LANGUAGES THE Swiss are apt to call their country the Helvetian Confederation , and a rather dowdy lady , called Helvetia , is apt to appear upon the coins and stamps of the twenty-two independent little republics whose representatives gather together at the capital city of Bern to discuss the affairs of the common fatherland . Since the World War , when the greater part of the country ( 7o% of the people speak German , 20% speak French , 6% speak Italian , and i% speak Romansh ) was more or less on the side of the Germans ( although maintaining a most scrupulous neutrality ) , the image of a slightly idealized young hero by the name of William Tell has somewhat tended to replace Helvetia who , I am sorry to say , was beginning to look more and more like Britannia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Regency England . This conflict of coin and stamp images ( they are not restricted to Switzerland ; almost any country has one of these queer problems ) clearly shows the dual nature of the Swiss Republic . To the outside world , all this is of very little importance . Switzerland , to those of us who are not of Swiss origin , is merely the country of picturesque mountain-ranges , and it is of these that I shall speak in the present chapter . The Alps , which stretch from the Mediterranean to the Adriatic , are little longer than Great Britain and contain about the same amount of territory . Sixteen thousand square miles of this land belong to Switzerland ( Denmark is just about as large ) , and of these i6,000 square miles 12,000 are productive in some way because they are covered with forests or vineyards or small bits of pasture . Four thousand square miles are either . covered by the  | water of the big lakes or form part of some picturesque precipice ; and 700 square miles are covered by glaciers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ square mile , while Belgium has 655 , and Germany 347 . But Norway has only 22 per square mile , and Sweden has 35 , and the idea therefore that Switzerland is merely a sort of gigantic mountain resort , inhabited exclusively by hotel-keepers and their guests , is slightly erroneous . For Switzerland , aside from its dairy products , has turned the wide northern plateau between the Alps and the Jura into one of the most prosperous industrial countries of Europe , and it has been able to do so with the help of only a few raw materials . It has of course a superabundance of water-power , and furthermore it enjoys a very favourable position right in the heart of Europe , which makes it possible for the finished products of the Helvetian Confederation to slide quietly but continuously into at least a dozen surrounding countries . In a previous chapter I tried to give you an idea of the origin of all such complicated masses of mountain-ridges as are represented by the Alps and the Pyrenees . I told you to take half a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of each other and push them together and then watch the wrinkles and the creases and double-jointed circles and crumples that are the result of such a forcible concentration . The table on which you performed this geological experiment was the original base or core of granite ( countless millions of years old ) across which the younger layers folded themselves during subsequent millions of years , to become those queerly-shaped pinnacles which were given their present form and aspect by still other millions of years of wind and rain and snow and ice . These enormous folds , from ten to twelve thousand feet above the plains , have gradually crumpled into a series of parallel ranges . But in the centre of the country ( the village of Andermatt on the Gotthard Pass is the geographical centre of the country ) they meet in the huge mountains ( the so-called St Gotthard range ) which send the Rhine on its course towards the North Sea , the Rhone on its way to the Mediterranean , and which also give birth to those mountain-rivers which feed the lakes of Thun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the famous Italian lakes in the south . And it is precisely in this neighbourhood of glaciers , and precipices , and valleys , so deep that they hardly ever see the rays of the sun , in this region of avalanches and impassable mountain streams , green with the chilly waters of a dozen melting glaciers , that the Swiss Republic took its origin . It was , as not infrequently happens , a combination of practical Caption politics with certain geographical peculiarities of the land which gave the Swiss a chance to make a bid for independence . For ; almost a thousand years the half-savage peasants of these inaccessible valleys had been left alone by all their more powerful neighbours . What was the use of hoisting the proud standard of empire when there was no plunder ? At best one could deprive these wild men of a couple of cow-hides . But they were dangerous barbarians , with their aptitude for guerrilla warfare and their command of those uncomfortable boulders that came crashing down from the hillsides and would squash a suit of armour as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so the Swiss were treated as the Indians that lived behind the Alleghenies were treated by the original settlers of the Atlantic coast ? they were ignored . But with the rising importance of the Papacy and the tremendous upward sweep of Italian commerce during and immediately after the Crusades , northern Europe felt a very real need of a more direct and convenient route from Germany to Italy than those Caption provided by the St Bernard Pass ( which necessitated a long detour by way of Lyons and the entire Rhone valley , via the lake of Geneva ) or the Brenner Pass , which meant that one had to cross the Habsburg domains with their almost unbearable tariff rates . It was then that the peasants of the Cantons ( the name for the independent little Swiss republics or districts ) of Unterwalden , Uri , and Schwyz decided to combine and each spend a little money ( Heaven knows , they did not have much ) upon the road that led from the valley of the Rhine to the valley of the Ticino River .  | They cut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were too hard to be removed by means of pick-axes ( try to make a mountain road without dynamite ! ) they made narrow wooden contraptions which they hung from the side of the mountain walls to negotiate difficult corners ; and they built some primitive stone bridges across the Rhine , hitherto impassable except by pedestrians during the height of the summer . Part of the way they followed the road that had been traced by the engineers of Charlemagne , four centuries before , but had never been completed ; and by the end of the thirteenth century a merchant with a caravan of packmules could travel from Basle to Milan by way of the St Gotthard Pass with a fair assurance that he would not lose more than two or three of his animals on account of broken legs and falling stones . As early as the year 1331 we hear of the existence of a hospice on top of the Pass , and although it was not opened to carriages until 1820 it was soon one of the most popular routes for commerce between the south and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Uri , and Schwyz allowed themselves to be paid a slight remuneration for all the trouble they had taken . This steady revenue , together with the impetus this international traffic gave to such cities as Lucerne and Zurich , gave these small peasant communities a new feeling of independence which no doubt had a great deal to do with their open defiance of the Habsburg family . The latter , curiously enough , were also originally of Swiss peasant stock , although they did not mention this in any of the genealogies which were preserved in their home castle of Habichtsburg ( or Hawk 's Nest ) that stood near the spot where the river Aar flows into the Rhine . I am sorry to be so prosaic , but it was the tangible revenue derived from a busily patronized Alpine trade-route rather than the bravery of a mythical William Tell which was responsible for the foundation of what afterwards developed into the modern Swiss Republic . That modern Swiss Republic is a highly interesting political experiment built firmly upon one of the most efficient elementary education systems of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so effectively that even Swiss  | citizens have to think for a moment when you ask them suddenly who happens to be their President . For their country is run by a Bundesrat ? a sort of Board of Managers ? composed of seven members , and every year they appoint a new President ( usually the Vice-President of the previous year ) and custom , though not law , provides that one year he shall belong to the German-speaking part of the country , the next year to the French-speaking part , and the third year to the Italian-speaking sub-division . This President , however , bears no resemblance whatsoever to the President of the United States of America . He is merely the temporary chairman of a Federal Executive which expresses its will through the mouths of seven individual members . The President , apart from presiding over the meetings of the federal council , is Minister of Foreign Affairs , but his position is so inconspicuous that he has no official residence . When distinguished strangers have to be entertained , the party is given in the rooms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more resemblance to a simple Bier fest in a little mountain village than to the semi-royal receptions of the French or American presidents . The main details of the administration are too complicated to be mentioned here , but the visitor to Switzerland is constantly being reminded that somewhere or other an intelligent and honest person is constantly on the watch to see that things are being done and are being done both honestly and intelligently . Take the matter of railway transport , to which , of course , are attached innumerable difficulties . The two main arteries that connect Italy with northern Europe run straight through the heart of the Swiss Alps . The Mont Cenis tunnel connects Paris with Turin ( the ancient capital of the kingdom of Savoy ) by way of Dijon and Lyons . And the Brenner line provides a direct communication between southern Germany and Vienna , but although it crosses the Alps it does not pass through any long tunnel . The Simplon line and the St Gotthard lines , however , are not only tunnel-borers but veritable mountain-climbers . The St Gotthard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1872 and finished ten years later . It took eight years to dig the tunnel , which is nine and a Caption  | half miles long and reaches a height of almost 4000 feet . Even more interesting than the tunnel itself are the spiral tunnels between Wassen and Goeschenen . Since the valleys were so narrow that they offered no room for even a single track , the railway had to do its climbing through the heart of the mountains themselves . Besides these special tunnels there are fifty-nine other tunnels ( several of them almost a mile long ) , nine large viaducts , and forty-eight bridges . The second most important transalpine railway , that of the Simplon , offers us a direct route between Paris and Milan by way of Dijon , Lausanne , and the valley of the Rhone as far as Brieg . It was opened for traffic in 1906 , exactly a century after Napoleon had finished his famous Simplon Pass road with its 250 big and 350 small bridges and its ten long tunnels , the greatest piece of roadbuilding the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much easier to construct than that of the St Gotthard , follows the slowly ascending valley of the Rhone until it reaches a spot about 2000 feet high where the tunnel begins . This tunnel is twelve and a half miles long and provided with double tracks . So is the Lotschberg tunnel ( nine miles long ) which connects northern Switzerland with the Simplon railway and western Italy . Although one of the narrowest of mountain-ranges , the socalled Pennine Alps , through which the Simplon railway runs , have a climate all their own . There are no fewer than twenty-one peaks of 12,000 feet or more within this small quadrangle , and 140 glaciers feed the turbulent streams , which have a most annoying habit of washing away railway bridges just a few minutes before the arrival of one of the big international express trains . That there never have been any wrecks on account of these aquatic surprise parties speaks highly for the efficiency of the Swiss railway men . But as I have said before , in this somewhat stiff and rather bureaucratic republic , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and too dangerous to encourage the amiable philosophy of muddling through . ' Somewhere , somehow , some one is for ever watching , observing , paying attention . That such a general tendency towards a rather schoolmasterish  | punctuality and efficiency does not make for artistic success is a well-known fact . In literature and the arts  --  painting , sculpture , or music ? the Swiss have never produced anything that has travelled far beyond their own narrow confines . But then , the world is full of artistic ' nations , while only a few can boast of centuries of uninterrupted political and economic growth and development . And the system suits the average Swiss and his wife . What more should we ask ?  | GERMANY , THE NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED TOO LATE MERELY for the sake of convenience I have divided the different countries of Europe into racial or cultural groups , and I have started my general discussion with those nations which still showed unmistakable evidences of having been Roman colonies ere they began an independent political existence . It is true that Rome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least ( Rumania ) the Latin language has survived as the national tongue . But the great Mongolian , Slavic , and Turkish invasions of the Middle Ages have so completely destroyed all evidence of Roman civilization in that part of the world that it would be decidedly erroneous to include the Balkan monarchies in the present discussion , wherefore I shall now bid farewell to the Mediterranean range-of-influence and proceed to that other form of civilization which was of Germanic origin and which came to be centred around the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean . There is ( I have already told you that when I spoke of France ) a vast semicircular plain which stretches all the way from the eastern Russian hills , where the Dnieper and the Dvina and the Neva and the Volga take their origin , to the Pyrenees . The southern part of that semicircle was brought under Roman control a very short time after the Germanic tribes began their mysterious migrations towards the west . The eastern part , even then , seems to have been occupied by those nomadic Slavic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed off , and which therefore , like the rabbits of Australia , were invincible . Thus the only part that was still available when the hungry Teutonic invaders appeared upon the scene was that big square which stretched from the Vistula on the east to the Rhine delta on  | the west . The Baltic was its northern limit and in the south a long line of Roman block-houses reminded all newcomers that they were entering upon a forbidden territory . The western part of this southern region was mountainous . First there were the Ardennes , the Rhine Highlands , and the Vosges , on the western bank of the river Rhine . Then , going from west to east , came the Black Forest , the Jura Mountains of Germany , the Erz ( or Iron Ore ) Mountains ( present-day Bohemia ) , the Riesengebirge , and finally the Carpathians , which stretched almost as far as the Black Sea . The rivers in this territory were forced to flow northward . In order of their appearance from west to east there was first the Rhine , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over which people have fought and wept more copiously than over any other mountain stream . For the Rhine is really a very modest little river . The Amazon is over five times as long . The Mississippi and Missouri are six times its length , and even the Ohio , which Americans do not consider much of a river as rivers go , is five hundred miles longer . Then comes the Weser River , with the modern city of Bremen near its mouth . Then the Elbe , which has made Hamburg what it is to-day . Then the Oder , which gave rise to the city of Stettin , the export harbour for the products of the town of Berlin and its industrial hinterland . Finally there is the Weichsel or Vistula , with the city of Danzig , which is now a free state ruled by a commissioner appointed by the League of Nations . Millions of years ago this northern territory was covered with glaciers . When they retreated they left behind them a large , stony waste , which towards the North Sea and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marshes developed a fringe of sand dunes , and these dunes reach almost all the way from the Flemish coast to Konigsberg , the old Prussian capital near the Russian frontier . As soon as these dunes had developed , the marshes began to enjoy a certain protection from the tides of the ocean . That meant the beginning of vegetation , and as soon as the soil had been prepared for timber the forests appeared , those same forests which , converted into peat fields ,  | provided our ancestors with an unlimited supply of fairly good fuel . Both the North Sea and the Baltic , which are the northern and western frontiers of this plain , bear the name sea ' as a courtesy title . They are really shallow ponds . The average depth of the North Sea is only sixty fathoms ( a fathom is six feet ) and its greatest depth is not more than 400 fathoms . The depth of the Baltic is seldom more than 100 fathoms . The average depth of the Atlantic , on the other hand , is 2170 fathoms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These figures show you that you had better think of the North Sea and the Baltic as submerged valleys . A slight elevation of the surface of the earth would once more turn them into dry land . And now let us look at a map of the dry land of Germany . I mean the map as it is to-day and as it must have been more or less when human beings followed the retreating glaciers and settled down permanently in this part of the old continent . These early immigrants were savages . They lived by catching wild animals and by growing a little grain . But they were savages with a very decided sense of beauty , and as their own territory was poor in those metals which could be used for ornaments , they had to send abroad for their gold and silver . The following statement may come as a mild shock to many of my readers , but original trade-routes were luxury routes . Many early contests between the races that inhabited different parts of the world were luxury contests . The Romans learned the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had penetrated as far as the mysterious Baltic in search of amber , used for personal adornment by Romans , Celts , and Teutons of both sexes . The desire for that small , lustrous concretion , which is sometimes found inside the shell of an oyster , and with which women delight to attract attention to the pretty curves of their ears or the slenderness of their fingers , has been responsible for more voyages of discovery in the Pacific and in the Indian Ocean than any other cause , including the desire of many honest people to carry the Gospel unto the heathen .  | The quest for ambergris , a substance found in the intestinal canals of sperm whales , and the result of what in plain English we would call a bilious attack on the part of the unfortunate whale , has driven more ships to the coasts of Brazil and Madagascar and the Moluccas than the search for herring or sardines or other forms of useful food . For ambergris could be used as a base for many perfumes that smelled deliciously of flowers and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ half as interesting . A change in fashions which made the women of the seventeenth century wear their corsets underneath their gowns and out of sight ( twelve-course dinners were bad for the figure ) was directly responsible for much of our knowledge of the Arctic . As soon as Paris had decided that hats should be adorned with aigrets , those hunters who went after the white herons to deprive them of their head plumes ( regardless of the fact that this meant the extinction of one of the loveliest and noblest birds of all creation ) penetrated further into southern lagoons than when they were merely in quest of their daily bread and butter . I might continue the list for almost a dozen more pages . Whatever was rare and therefore expensive has always been an object of desire to those who , by a wasteful demonstration of their riches , hoped to impress their less fortunate neighbours . Ever since the beginning of history , luxury rather than necessity has been the real pioneer of progress along the lines of exploration . And when we study the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old luxury routes , for in the main they arc the same as those of medieval and modern times . Take the conditions some three thousand years ago . The mountain-ridges of the south , the Harz , the Erz Mountains , and the Riesengebirge , were situated hundreds of miles away from the sea . The plain that stretched northward towards the North Sea and the Baltic had long since changed from marshland into dry land and was now thickly covered with forests . And Man , following in the wake of the glaciers , which had now retreated in the general direction of Scandinavia and Finland , had claimed this entire wilderness as his own . Among the hills of the south , the  | tribes which inhabited the valleys had found that it paid them to cut down their trees and sell them to the Romans who had occupied strategic positions along the Rhine and the Danube . For the rest , few of these early Teuton nomads and farmers had ever seen a Roman . One Roman expedition had tried to penetrate to the heart of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ valley and slaughtered to a man , so that the experiment was not tried again That did not mean however that northern Germany was completely cut off from all contact with the rest of the world . The great prehistoric trade-route from west to east , from the Iberian peninsula to the plains of Russia , followed the line from the Pyrenees to Paris , through the gaps of Poitiers and Tours , which I described in the chapter on France . It then skirted the Ardennes , and from there followed the outskirts of the central European highlands until it reached the northern lowlands now occupied by the United Soviet Republics of Russia . On its course eastward this road was of course obliged to cross a great many rivers , and it did this wherever it could find a convenient shallow place . Just as the city of Rome grew out of a ford across the Tiber , so a number of the earliest cities of northern Germany were but the continuation of prehistoric and early historic settlements which were situated on the exact spot where to-day we would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Berlin and Magdeburg and Breslau had all of them got their start that way . Leipzig , although originally it was a village in the heart of Slavic lands , was also of commercial origin , for it was there that the mineral products from the Saxon mountains , such as silver and lead and copper and iron , were assembled before they were sent down the rivers and sold to the merchants patronizing the great European highways from east to west . Of course , once this road reached the Rhine , water traffic began to compete seriously with the caravans used for the long overland haul . Water traffic has always been much cheaper and much more convenient than land traffic , and long before Caesar caught his first glimpse of the Rhine there must have been rafts used to carry merchandise from Strassburg ( where the Rhine connected with Caption  | the hinterland of Franconia , Bavaria , and Wurttemberg ) to Cologne ( I use the modern names ) and thence to the marshes of the Low Countries and eventually to Britain . Berlin , situated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from north-west to south-east ( from Paris to Petrograd and from Hamburg to Constantinople in modern terms ) happened to meet , was bound to become important . But its population remained small until the nineteenth century , when science and industry improved the waterways , and built the railways . Throughout the Middle Ages Germany consisted of a large number of semi-independent states , but until three hundred years ago there was nothing to indicate that some day this western part of the great European plain would develop into a leading nation of the world . Curiously enough the modern Germany grew almost directly out of the failure of the Crusading Movement . When it became certain that no new territory was to be conquered in western Asia ( the Mohammedans had proved more than a match for the Christians ) the disinherited classes of Europe began to look for other sources of agricultural wealth . Quite naturally they thought at once of the opportunities offered by the Slavic lands situated just across the Oder and the Vistula , which were inhabited by the wild and heathenish Prussians . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , moved , lock , stock , and barrel , from Palestine to east Prussia and transferred its business centre from Acre in Galilea to Marienburg , thirty miles south of Danzig . For two hundred years these knights fought the Slays and settled the farms of their victims with imported nobles and peasants from the west . In the year 1410 they suffered a terrific defeat at the hands of the Poles in the battle of Tannenberg , the same place where in 1914 Hindenburg annihilated the Russian armies . But somehow or other the order survived even this blow , and when the Reformation occurred they were still a body of considerable importance . It so happened that at that time the order was ruled by a member of the Hohenzollern family . This particular Grand Master not only joined the Protestant cause but , on the advice of Martin Luther , he declared himself hereditary Duke of Prussia ,  | with Konigsberg on the Gulf of Danzig as his capital . Early in the seventeenth century this duchy was acquired by another branch of the industrious and shrewd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fifteenth century had been administering the sandy wastes of Brandenburg . A hundred years afterwards ( in 1710 , to be precise ) these Brandenburg upstarts felt themselves strong enough to aspire to something better than the rank of a mere prince elector , ' and they began an agitation to get themselves recognized as kings . The emperor of the Holy Roman Empire was willing . Dog as a rule does not eat dog , and the Habsburgs were glad to render some small service to their good friends the Hohenzollerns . Were n't they both members of the same club ? In 1871 , the seventh Hohenzollern King of Prussia became the first Emperor of a United Germany . Forty-seven years later , the ninth King of Prussia and the third Emperor of modern Germany was forced to leave his throne and his country , and that was the end of a vast holding company which began as a bankrupt remnant of crusading orders and finished as the strongest and most efficient bower of the great age of industrialism and capitalism . But we might as well be honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ astonishingly capable sort of men , or at least were clever enough to surround themselves with servants of extraordinary ability . For remember that their original territories had possessed no natural wealth of any sort . Prussia had ever been a land of farms and forests and sand and marshes . She did not produce a single article that she could export ? the only means whereby she might get a favourable balance of trade . There was a slight change for the better when a German discovered a way by which sugar could be extracted from beets . But since cane sugar was still infinitely cheaper than beet-sugar , and could be imported by the ship-load from the West Indies , all this meant very little money in the pockets of either Prussians or lirandenburgians . But when the Emperor Napoleon , after having lost his navy in the battle of Trafalgar , decided to destroy England by means of an inverted blockade , ' there arose a sudden but very steady demand for the Prussian beet-sugar . At about the sams  | time , German chemists established the value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the country could at last begin to work a little for the foreign market . The Hohenzollerns , however , were always lucky . After the defeat of Napoleon , Prussia acquired the Rhine region . It was of no particular value until the industrial revolution put a premium upon the possession of coal and iron . Quite unexpectedly Prussia found herself possessed of some of the richest ore and coal fields of the entire world . And then at last the hard school of poverty of the previous five hundred years began to bear fruit . Poverty had already taught the Germans to be thorough and thrifty . It now showed them how to over-manufacture and under-sell all other nations . And when there was no longer room enough on land for the rapidly increasing number of little Teutons , they took to the sea , and within less than half a century they were among the leaders of the countries which derive their revenue from the carrying trade . Hamburg and Bremen , which had been of considerable importance , were called back to life , and seriously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other British ports . A large ship canal was dug from the Baltic to the North Sea , the socalled Kiel Canal , which was opened in 1895 . Canals also connected the Rhine and the Weser and the Oder and the Vistula and the Main and the Danube , providing a direct aquatic route between the North Sea and the Black Sea , and Berlin was given access to the Baltic by means of a canal that ran from the capital to the Oder River and Stettin . Whatever human ingenuity could do to assure the majority of the people a fairly decent living wage was done , and before the Great War , the average German peasant and working man , while by no means rich , and accustomed to very strict discipline , was probably better housed and better fed and in a general way better protected against accidents and old age than any other group of people belonging to the same class anywhere else . How all this was sacrificed in the unfortunate outcome of the Great War is a very sad story which does not belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defeat Germany lost the rich industrial  | districts of Alsace and Lorraine that she had taken from the french nearly fifty years previously . She lost all her colonies , her commercial navy , and part of the province of Schleswig-Holstein which she had taken from the Danes after the war of 1864 . Several thousand miles of former Polish territory ( but thoroughly Germanized by then ) were once again separated from Prussia and returned to Poland , while a broad strip of land , following the course of the Vistula and running from Thorn to Gdynia and the Baltic , was put under Polish suzerainty , that this country might enjoy direct access to the open sea . Part of Silesia , which Frederick the Great had taken from Austria in the eighteenth century , remained in German hands . But the more valuable mineral deposits were given to Poland , although the textile interests stayed under German control . For the rest , Germany was stripped of everything she had acquired during the previous fifty years , and her colonies in Asia and Africa were divided among other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surplus population with which to settle them . Politically speaking , the Treaty of Versailles may have been an excellent document . From the point of view of applied geography , it makes one despair of the future of Europe . I am afraid that those sceptical neutrals who wanted to present Lloyd George and the late Monsieur Clemenceau with a handbook on elementary geography were not so very far wrong .  | AUSTRIA , THE COUNTRY THAT WAS AN EMPIRE THE present Republic of Austria has 6,500,000 inhabitants , and 2,000,000 of these live in the capital city of Vienna . As a result of this extraordinary arrangement the country is top-heavy , and the marvellous old town on the Danube ( which river is a muddy grey and not at all as blue as the famous waltz might make you expect ) is slowly degenerating into a dead city where disheartened old men and women wander aimlessly among the ruins of their former glory , while members of the younger generation have fled abroad to start a new existence amid happier surroundings , or have committed suicide because life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gay city of Vienna ( one of the few cities where the people seemed to be really happy , if often in a sort of childish and careless way ) , that old , important centre of science and medicine and the arts , will have become a second Venice . From being a capital of an empire containing more than 50,000,000 people it has become a mere village , dependent upon the tourist traffic and what little importance it retains as a port of call for the boats that carry the products of Bohemia and Bavaria to Rumania and to the Black Sea . At present the geography of the ancient Danube monarchy ( this name , by which Austria was formerly known , expressed the true nature of the country about as well as anything could do ) is extremely complicated , for it has been hacked to pieces in such an arbitrary fashion as to be almost unrecognizable . But the former dual monarchy of Austria-Hungary was a perfect example of how natural conditions will influence the formation of strong centralized States . Forget all about frontiers for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which was situated almost in the very heart of the European continent , as far away from the toe of  | Italy 's foot as from the nose of the Danish peninsula . It was really an immense circle of flat lands and rolling territory , entirely surrounded by high mountain-ranges . On the west there were the Alps of Switzerland and the Tyrol . In the north were the Erz Mountains and the Riesengebirge ( the Giant Mountains ) of Bohemia , and the Carpathians , which formed a semicircle sheltering the Hungarian Puszta ( or steppe ) against invasions from the side of the Slavic plains . The Danube separated the Carpathians and their southern part , the so-called Transylvanian Alps , from the Balkan Mountains , and the Dinaric Alps were the barrier that protected the plains from the winds of the Adriatic Sea . The people who founded this State had very imperfect maps , and their theoretical knowledge of geography was quite negligible . But just as the pioneers who conquered the Western United States followed certain definite tracks and routes without having consciously studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final destination , so did those medieval conquerors accumulate their vast holdings by merely doing what was immediately practicable ' without bothering themselves about the theoretical side of the problem . Such things took care of themselves . Nature provided them with certain unavoidable consequences ' and Man , whenever he is wise , quietly obeys her commands . During the first thousand years of our era , the great Hungarian plain was a veritable no-man's-land , invaded by the tribes who followed the course of the Danube on their way from the Black Sea to the west , and who were without any settled form of government . Charlemagne , during his life-long warfare upon the Slavic people from the east , founded a small mark ' or frontier post , as we would call it , which , being the eastern mark or Oester Reich ( the same word as Austria ' ) , gave birth to the principality that eventually was to dominate that part of the world . Although at times overrun by the Hungarians and the Turks the little mark , firmly handled and efficiently administered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Habsburgs , our Swiss friends whom I mentioned a few pages ago , always came out on top . Eventually these rulers of a petty frontier State even managed to get themselves elected as Emperors of that Holy Roman Empire which was  | neither Roman nor Holy nor an Empire , but merely a loose federation of all the different German-speaking races . They held this title until the year i8o6 when Napoleon threw it on the scrapheap because he intended to put an imperial crown on his own brow . But even thereafter these not over-brilliant but tenacious Habsburgs managed to keep a finger ? and a most important finger ? in the German pie , until finally in 1866 Prussia pushed them back across their own mountains and bade them stay where they belonged . To-day the old Eastern Mark , reduced to the rank of a seventhrate nation , torn by internal strife and without any hope for a better future , consists , for the greater part , of that mountainous region which is but a continuation of the Swiss Alps , and which contains the remnants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy by the Treaty of Versailles on the ground that once upon a time they had been part of the ancient Roman Empire . This mountainous region contains two towns of some importance , Innsbruck , where the ancient route to Italy via the Brenner Pass crosses the river Inn , and where everything reminds one of the Middle Ages , and Salzburg , the birth-place of Mozart , which is one of the most beautiful cities of Europe and which tries to keep alive to-day by providing the world with a few musical and theatrical performances . Neither these mountains nor those of the Bohemian plateau in the north produce anything of any value . The same can be said of the so-called Viennese basin where the Romans founded an armed camp called Vindobona ( or Vienna ) , a small settlement which gained some notoriety when the famous philosopher-emperor Marcus Aurelius died there in A.D. 180 after one of his many campaigns against the barbarians of the northern Germanic plains . The town , however , did not come into its own until ten centuries later , when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Crusades , made it the point of departure for those who tried to reach the Promised Land by following the Danube rather than by entrusting themselves to the profiteering ship-owners of Genoa and Venice . In 1276 it became the residence of the Habsburg family and the  | centre of their vast domains , which eventually included all the land between the mountain-ranges enumerated a few pages back . In the year 1485 the Hungarians captured the city . In 1529 and again in 1683 the Turks laid siege to it . But the town survived all these misadventures until the beginning of the eighteenth century , when it began to disintegrate as a result of a mistaken policy which entrusted every position of any importance in the monarchy to noblemen of strictly Germanic origin . Too much power is a hard test for all people , and the amiable Austrian knights were no exception . They ceased to be merely amiable and became feeble and weak . In the old dual monarchy , 47% of the people were of Slavic origin and only 25% ( or one-quarter ) were Germans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Rumanians ( 7% ) with about 600,000 Italians ( 1.5% ) , and about ioo , 000 Gypsies who stuck pretty closely to Hungary where they were treated more or less like respectable citizens . The heavy thumping administered by Napoleon to his dear lather-in-law , the Emperor of Austria , was not without its effects upon the economic and political life of the Austrian Empire , but right up to the outbreak of the Great War Vienna remained the most brilliant , the most socially stand-offish capital in Europe . This was the Vienna of the Blue Danube waltz , the charming city where you were sure of having a good time among delightful people ? if you could point to a sufficient number of heraldic yuarterings on your family shield ! It was all very artificial and outof-date ; but the merchants and the manufacturers made their profits out of the obsolete system , and musicians , actors , artists , and architects found Viennese life much to their liking . " Then came the War ? and " Good-bye to all that ! " The country now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which it was the head until only a few years ago . Its future is entirely behind it . It is a State in name only . The rc ( usal of the French to let it join the German Republic was the last straw . It might just as well be put up for public sale . But who would want to buy it ?  | DENMARK , AN OBJECT-LESSON WHICH SHOWS THAT A SMALL COUNTRY MAY ENJOY CERTAIN ADVANTAGES OVER LARGE ONES DENMARK iS such a tiny country , as modern nations go ( it has only about three and a half million inhabitants , of whom 750,000 live in the capital and its suburbs ) , that we might well pass it by , if quantity rather than quality were of any real importance in the affairs of men . But as an example of what can be made out of indifferent material by the application of intelligence combined with a sensible ideal of life ( that " moderation in all things " which the Greeks had proclaimed as the highest form of wisdom ) Denmark , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most honourable mention . For that country with its 16,000 square miles and its total lack of natural resources , armies , navies , mines , or mountains ( at no point does the country rise above 600 feet ) is worth a dozen other countries of infinitely greater size and more pretensions and militaristic ambitions which I could mention if I felt so inclined . The Danish people , entirely through their own efforts , have lowered the illiteracy percentage to zero , they have made themselves the second richest country per head of all Europe , and they have practically abolished both riches and poverty as they are known in the rest of the world , establishing instead a balance of average , moderate well-to-do-ness which is without an equal anywhere else . Denmark , as one glance at the map will show you , is composed of a peninsula and a number of islands separated from each other by wide open sounds , across which the railway trains are carried on ferries . Its climate is exceedingly unpleasant . All winter long a strong eastern wind is apt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showers of rain and forcing the Danes , like the Dutch with whom they have so much in common , to spend a great deal of their time indoors , a circumstance which has contributed greatly to making them a heavy hook-reading nation . In consequence thereof they are a singularly well-informed group of people who own more books per head than any other nation . But the rain and the wind keep the pastures moist , and the grass grows and makes the cows fat , and as a result of all this Denmark alone is able to provide the world with thirty per cent of its butter . But whereas in most other countries the soil would be owned by rich and absentee landlords , the Danes , who are essentially democratic ( in the social and economic rather than the political sense of the word ) , have never encouraged the development of those vast holdings which we have encountered in other countries . There are to-day 150,000 independent farmers in Denmark who operate small farms , ranging from ten to a hundred acres , and there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dairy products which are sent abroad are produced and prepared according to the most modern and scientific methods , as taught by the rural agricultural schools , which are merely a continuation of the free High School system spread all over the country . The buttermilk that is left over as a by-product of the butter manufacturing is used to feed the hogs , which in turn provide the British market with most of its bacon . As this trade in butter and bacon is much more profitable than the cultivation of grain , the Danes are obliged to import their grain . They can do this , however , quite easily and cheaply , as Copenhagen is only two days by steamer from Danzig , and Danzig is the old export harbour for the vast granaries of Poland and Lithuania . Part of this grain is used for poultry-raising , and millions of eggs are sent each year to those same British Isles which for some mysterious reason have been satisfied until now to allow foreign farmers a free and open market . In order to maintain what almost amounts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a most rigorous State control of everything that leaves their country , thereby establishing for  | themselves such a reputation of absolute integrity that their trademark has come to be accepted as a guarantee of absolute purity . Like all races of Teutonic origin , the Danes are incurable gamblers , and during the last few years their ventures in banking and in stock-market speculation have cost them a tidy sum of money . But the children and the cows and the hogs remained when the banks closed their doors , and now they are at work once more . The only difficulties they have got to fear have to do with the rapidly increasing state of bankruptcy of most of their neighbours , making such a simple dish as ham and eggs a luxury beyond the reach of the average man . The towns on the mainland are of no importance . On the west coast of Jutland ( the name of the old peninsula from which so many of the original settlers of England came ) lies Esbjerg , which is the main export harbour for the many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( the double A is pronounced OA in Danish ) , one of the oldest centres of Christianity in this part of the world where the people continued to worship their heroic pagan gods ( their Odins and Thors and Baldurs ) until only four centuries before the discovery of America . The Little Belt ( I believe there are plans now to build a bridge across it ) separates Jutland from Fyen , the first of the big Baltic islands . In the centre of Fyen ( cows , hogs , and children ) lies the city of Odense ( the place sacred to Odin ) where Hans Christian Andersen was born , the son of a poor and sickly shoemaker but one of the greatest benefactors of mankind . Then we cross the Great Belt and reach the island of Zealand , the heart of the old Danish Empire . Here at a wide bay , protected from the violence of the Baltic by the small island of Amager , the vegetable garden of the capital , lies the charming city of Copenhagen , the Merchants ' Harbour ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centuries , when the Danes ruled an empire which included England and Norway and parts of Sweden , Copenhagen was merely a fishing village , and Roskilde , about fifteen miles inland , was the royal residence from which those distant domains were administered ; but to-day Roskilde is of no importance , while Copenhagen has gone on increasing in Caption  | size and importance until now it provides entertainment for onefifth of the entire population of the country . Copenhagen is a royal residence , and a few guards in very handsome uniforms present arms when the King goes swimming or fishing , or strolls forth to buy himself a packet of cigarettes . But you will look in vain for any other manifestations of military grandeur . This small country , which has done some of the hardest and bitterest fighting in the days gone by , and which even as recently as 1864 was able to hold its own against Prussia for quite a long time , voluntarily abolished its army and navy and has replaced them by a small corps of State police to enforce whatever neutrality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That is about all there is to say of Denmark . The country peacefully goes its own way . The royal family keeps off the front page of the more sensational newspapers , and while few people have three overcoats , none go without , and while only a small percentage has a motor car , every man , woman , and child possesses at least a couple of bicycles , as you will know for yourself if you have ever tried to cross a street in a Danish city just before the hour for lunch . In a world devoted to the worship of bigness Denmark does not play an important part . In a world devoted to the ideal of greatness it would occupy quite a considerable position . For if the greatest happiness of the greatest number of people is the ultimate goal to which all governments should aspire , Denmark has done more than enough to justify its continued existence as an independent nation .  | ICELAND , AN INTERESTING POLITICAL LABORATORY IN THE ARCTIC OCEAN FROM the days of her ancient imperial glory Denmark has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continent , Greenland , which seems to contain valuable mineral treasures ( iron , zinc , and graphite ) but which is so completely covered with glaciers ( only about one-thirtieth of the whole of Greenland is free from ice ) that it may never be of any value unless the axis of the earth shifts just a tiny little bit and allows Greenland once more to enjoy that tropical climate which must have prevailed there millions of years ago , as we are able to deduce from the presence of several large coalfields . Her other colonies are the Faroe Islands ( literally the Sheep Islands ) , which lie two hundred miles north-west of the Shetlands and have a population of about 20,000 people and a capital city called Thorshavn , from where Hudson commenced his dash across the ocean which carried him to Manhattan . And then there is Iceland . The latter is a country of particular interest . Not only on account of its volcanic nature , which makes it a veritable storehouse for all those queer phenomena we usually connect with the mysterious fires from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its political development . It is the oldest republic of our planet with a record of self-government which began some ten centuries ago , and which with only a few short interruptions has lasted until to-day . The first settlers of the island were fugitives from Norway who found their way to this distant spot in the ninth century . Although 5000 square miles out of the total of Iceland 's 40,000 arc perpetually covered with glaciers and snowfields , and less than one-hundredth of the island is really fit for purposes of agriculture ,  | living conditions there were so much more favourable than in the mother country that already by the beginning of the ninth century there were over 4000 homesteads inhabited by free and independent farmers . And these , continuing the habits of practically all early Germanic tribes , at once established a loose form of self-government . It consisted of an Althing ? a gathering of the different local Things ' or moots ' ( really the same word as our meeting ' ) . This Althing met once a year during midsummer on a huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles distant from Reykjavik , the present capital , which is only a hundred years old . During the first two centuries of their independent existence the Icelanders developed enormous energy , composed some of the best sagas that have been written , discovered Greenland and America ( five centuries before Columbus ) , and made this northern island , where in the winter the days are only four hours long , a more important centre of civilization than the mother country itself . But the curse of all Germanic races ? an all-too-pronounced individualism which makes political or economic co-operation almost an impossibility ? had accompanied the natives on their flight to the west . During the thirteenth century Iceland was conquered by the Norwegians , and when Norway became part of Denmark , Iceland followed suit . The Danes completely neglected the island , which henceforth was at the mercy of French and even Algerian pirates until all the old prosperity had disappeared , while the literature and architecture of the heathenish period lay forgotten and the ancient wooden buildings of nobles and freedmen were being replaced by huts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ century , however , there has been a return of some of the old prosperity and with it a renewed demand for complete independence . To-day Iceland once more rules itself as it did eleven centuries ago , although outwardly still recognizing the King of Denmark as its sovereign . The biggest city on the island , Reykjavik , has about 25,000 inhabitants and is the seat of a university . The total number of inhabitants does not exceed one hundred thousand , but they have an excellent literature of their  | own . There are no villages but only isolated farms , where the children are taught , and taught well , by itinerant schoolmasters . Altogether this is a most interesting little corner of the world . Like so many other small countries , it shows what can be done when intelligence is pitted against unfavourable outward circumstances . For Iceland surely is no earthly paradise . While the winters are not very cold , due to the presence of a branch of the Caption Gulf Stream , the summers are much too short to allow of the cultivation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ever raining ! The twenty-nine volcanoes of which the most famous , Hekla , has been responsible for twenty-eight outbreaks during the period of which we have any historical record , have covered the island with vast tracts of lava , some of which are over a thousand square miles large . Earthquakes have upon occasion destroyed hundreds of farms , and enormous fissures or clefts , running often for miles across the solid sheet of lava , and sulphur springs and lakes of boiling mud make travel from one part of the island to another a somewhat complicated affair . The geysers , or hot-water gushers ,  | for which Iceland is so famous are interesting rather than dangerous , for although one of these , the famous Big Geyser , sometimes spouts its boiling water as high as a hundred feet , their activity is steadily decreasing . And yet people not only live in Iceland but want to go on living there . During the last sixty years more than 2o,000 of them have moved to America , chiefly to Manitoba . But many of these emigrants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is uncomfortable . But it is home .  | THE SCANDINAVIAN PENINSULA , THE TERRITORY OCCUPIED BY THE KINGDOMS OF SWEDEN AND NORWAY THE people of the Middle Ages , who lived in a happy world of fairy stories , knew exactly how the Scandinavian peninsula happened to have got its queer shape . After the good Lord had finished the work of creation , the Devil came along to see what He had been doing those seven long days He had been away from Heaven . When the Devil saw our planet in the first flush of its young loveliness he lost his temper , and got so terribly angry that he heaved a large rock at Mankind 's new home . That rock landed in the Arctic Sea and became the Scandinavian peninsula . It was so , barren and bleak that it seemed entirely unfit for life . But the good Lord remembered that a little bit of rich earth had been left behind when He got through fashioning the other continents . These remnants He then sprinkled across the mountains of Norway and Sweden . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that explains why the greater part of these two countries has always remained a home for trolls and gnomes and werewolves , because no human being could hope to make a living from such a poor soil . Modern man also has a fairy story but it is a scientific one , based upon certain facts which he has been able to observe with his own eyes . According to geologists , the Scandinavian peninsula is merely the remnant of a very old and very large continent which long before the era of the coal forests had stretched from Europe all the way across the Arctic Ocean to America . We know of course that the present arrangement of our continents is of very recent origin ? that the continents seem to have been constantly on the move , like leaves floating on a pond ,  | and that several continents , now separated from each other by oceans and seas , were once upon a time a solid mass of land . When the continent of which Norway and Sweden had formed a part disappeared from view , only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ above water . So did Iceland and the Faroe Islands and the Shetland Islands and Scotland . The rest now lies at the bottom of the Arctic Ocean . Some day the roles may be reversed . Then the Arctic Ocean will become dry land , and Sweden and Norway will be turned over to the whales and the little fishes . The Norwegians do not seem to lose any sleep on account of this threat to their homeland . They have other things to worry them . The problem , for example , of keeping alive , which is by no means a simple one when you remember that in Norway less than four per cent . of the total area ( only four thousand square miles ) can be used for purposes of agriculture . Sweden is a little better off with ten per cent. , but even that is not so very much . There are of course certain compensations . One-half of Sweden is covered with woods and one-quarter of Norway is covered with pine and fir forests . These forests are slowly being cut down , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ America . It is done in the most scientific way imaginable , for both the Swedes and the Norwegians know that their country will never be any good for ordinary agricultural pursuits . That is the fault of the glaciers , which once upon a time covered the whole of the peninsula from the North Cape down to Lindesnaes . These glaciers scraped the soil from the rocky hillsides as completely and efficiently as a dog licks a plate . Not only did they deprive the mountains of their hard-earned soil ( it takes millions of years to make enough soil to cover such a vast stretch of land ) , but they carried it away with them and deposited it over that great northern plain of Europe of which I told you in the chapter about Germany . The scouts who went ahead of the great Asiatic invasion of Europe of forty centuries ago must have known this . When at last they crossed the Baltic , they found Scandinavia inhabited by a few nomads of Finnish origin . It was easy enough to drive them back  | into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done , how could the new settlers hope to make a living ? There were several ways . In the first place , they could go out and fish . The endless bays and fjords , which were really nothing but deep grooves dug into the rocks by the glaciers trying to reach the ocean , gave the country a coastline almost six times as long as it would have been if the Norwegian coast had formed a straight line , as it does in Holland or Denmark . The Norwegians Caption arc still fishing . The Gulf Stream sees to it that all the harbours , cven as far north as Hammerfest , remain open the whole year round . The nooks and crannies of the Lofoten Islands , on the brink of those cool , clean Arctic waters which the cod seems to prefer for breeding purposes , provide work for more than a hundred thousand fishermen and to an equal number of people rngaged in the business of canning whatever the trawlers bring on , hare . In the second place , if they did not care to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Norwegian coast there lies a row of islands and islets which account for seven per cent . of the country 's surface and which are separated from each other by such a complicated system of narrows and sands and bights and straits that a steamer going from Stavanger to Vardo has got to carry two pilots , each of whom takes charge every six hours . During the Middle Ages when there were no beacons and buoys  | and lighthouses ( Lindesnaes is the oldest lighthouse on the Norwegian coast , and even that is of comparatively recent date ) , no outsiders would come within a dozen miles of this dangerous coast . Although the story of the famous Maelstrom between two of the Lofoten Islands has been greatly exaggerated , no inexperienced skipper would venture into this watery labyrinth without at least half a dozen natives to show him the way . Those pirates Caption therefore who made their own familiar fjord their base of operations knew that they had little to fear as soon as they were within sight of the home range of mountains , and they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ improved their ships and their fighting technique until they could venture forth as far as England and Ireland and Holland . Once they had discovered the road to these comparatively nearby places , they gradually lengthened their voyages until the people of France and of Spain and Italy and far-off Constantinople began to feel uncomfortable whenever some returning merchantman reported that he had seen the dragon of a Viking ship somewhere in the neighbourhood . During the early part of the ninth century they plundered  | Paris not less than three times . They sailed up the river Rhine and got as far as Cologne and Mayence . As for England , Saxons and Danes fought each other for the possession of that country , as in later times nations have made war upon each other for a particularly desirable territory . About the same time that Iceland was discovered Norsemen had founded the first Russian State , of which they themselves were to be the rulers for almost seven entire centuries . Still later , a plundering expedition of two hundred boats ( small boats which could be carried overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Black Sea , and had caused such consternation in Constantinople that the Emperor of the eastern Roman Empire had hastened to take these wild men into his service as a special bodyguard . Entering the Mediterranean from the west , they had established themselves in Sicily and on the coasts of Spain and Italy and Africa , and had repeatedly rendered the most valuable services to the Papacy in its wars upon the rest of the world . What has become of all this glory of the ancient Norse nation ? All that remains to-day is a highly respectable little kingdom which catches and exports a lot of fish and engages in the carrying trade and fights bitter political quarrels about the language the people should speak ? quarrels of which the world at large would never notice anything if the Norwegian authorities did not have the fatal habit of changing the names of their most important cities and railway stations about once every two or three years . As for those cities of Norway , most of them are merely overrown villages where everybody 's dog knows everybody else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capital of the old Norwegian kingdom . It has an excellent harbour , and as soon as the Baltic is covered with ice Trondheim becomes the port from which a great deal of Swedish wood is shipped to the rest of the world . The present capital , Oslo , is built near the ruins of a very old Norwegian settlement which had been burned down . It was built by the Danish King Christian IV and therefore called Christiania until the Norwegians decided to purge their language of all  | Danish souvenirs . Oslo is situated in the richest agricultural part of Norway at the head of the Oslofjord , which runs into the Skagerrak , the broad sound which separates Norway from Denmark , and which is really a branch of the Atlantic Ocean . Such cities as Stavanger or Aalesund or Christiansand only come Caption to life when the whistle of the nine o'clock steamer blows . Bergen , the old Hansa settlement which looked after the commercial needs of the entire Norwegian coast , is now connected with Oslo by means of a railway . So is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coast of Sweden . Further north , well above the Arctic Circle , lies Narvik , the harbour for the Swedish iron ore from Lapland . Tromso and Hammerfest smell everlastingly of  | fish . These names occur here because it rarely happens that one finds human beings living comfortably at latitude 700 . It is a strange land . It is a hard land , a land that has driven hundreds of thousands of its sons and daughters away from its shores , bidding them shift for themselves ? a land that nevertheless has somehow or other managed to keep their love and loyalty . ' Cake a boat some time if you have a chance and travel northward . Everywhere it is the same . Some godforsaken little village , clinging to a bit of grass , just enough for a single goat , and five or six houses and a few ramshackle boats and one steamer a week and people weeping because they see it again ? because it is home ? because it is their home ? because it is part of their flesh and blood . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It takes on queer aspects in Bodo or in Vardo , ten days away by steamer from nowhere . Sweden , the other side of the mountain-range that remained after the great Arctic plateau had disappeared beneath the waves of the Atlantic , is a very different country from Norway . People often wonder why these two nations are separate . It would mean a great saving in the cost of administration if they could live together as one happy family . On paper such an arrangement appears eminently practicable . But the geographical background of the two countries makes it difficult . For whereas Norway on account of the Gulf Stream enjoys a mild climate with lots of rain and little snow ( in Bergen , they say , the horses shy whenever they meet a man without an umbrella ) , Sweden has a continental climate , with long , cold winters and a heavy snowfall . Whereas Norway has deep fjords that penetrate for miles into the interior , Sweden has a low coast with few natural harbours , none of which has achieved the importance of Gothenburg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials of its own , Sweden is possessed of some of the most valuable ore deposits of the world . The unfortunate absence of coal still forces Sweden to export a great deal of these ores to Great Britain , Germany , and France , hut during the last twenty years the taming of many important waterfalls has made Sweden increasingly independent of coal , while the forests that cover such a great part of the kingdom  | account for the enormously rich Swedish match trust and the farfamed Swedish paper factories . The Swedes have unbounded trust in the potentialities of the human intellect . Her scientists are therefore given free scope , and as a result her chemists have discovered and developed a large Caption number of by-products which arc derived from the wood industry and which otherwise would have gone to waste , such as celluloid and artificial silk . But her agriculture , although much more highly developed than that of Norway , suffers from the unfavourable climatic conditions which are the result of being situated on the cold and exposed side of that high mountain-range which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | Perhaps that is one of the reasons why the people are so fond of flowers . The winters arc so very long and dark . Every Swedish home therefore tries to keep bright with flowers and evergreen shrubs . In a great many other respects also Sweden is different from Norway . In Norway the feudal system of ancient times died out with the Black Death ? that terrible plague of the late Middle Ages . In Sweden , on the other hand , the continued existence of large land-holding interests has allowed the country nobility to maintain itself up to the present time . And although the country is now being ruled by a socialist Government , Stockholm is still a city with an aristocratic background , in sharp contrast to Oslo and Copenhagen , where the utmost democratic simplicity is as rigidly maintained as courtly manners are practised in the Swedish capital . Perhaps this development too is a direct result of Sweden 's curious geographical position . For whereas Norway faces the Atlantic , Sweden is essentially a country that looks out upon an inland sea , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is interwoven with that of the Baltic . As long as Scandinavia was still a half-settled wilderness , there was little to choose between the Norsemen of the western coast and those of the east . Z o the outside they were all of them Norsemen , ' and the famous old prayer " From the fury of the Norse , good Lord , deliver us , " was chanted without specifying what particular sort of Norsemen the humble supplicants had in mind . But after the tenth century there was a change . Then there arose a great and bitter civil warfare between the Swedes of the north , of Svealand , whose capital was situated on the Malar lake on which the modern capital of Stockholm is situated , and the Goths of the south or Gotaland .

During this period , too , Christianity had made its entrance into the Scandinavian peninsula ,  | and the clergy and the monasteries took the side of the nobles , until finally the Swedish monarchs became so weak that for a century and a half Sweden had to recognize the sovereignty of Denmark . Europe had almost forgotten that Sweden existed when in the year 1520 the western world was shocked by the tale of one of the most ghastly and inexcusable murders that has disgraced the history of man . In that year King Christian II of Denmark had invited all the heads of the Swedish nobility to a great banquet ? a sort of love-feast which once and for all would settle all difficulties between the King and his beloved Swedish subjects . At the end of the festivities all the guests were seized and were either beheaded or drowned . Only one man of any importance escaped ? fortunately for him he was abroad at the time . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who perished along with the rest of King Christian 's guests . On his way northward Gustavus received news of the massacre , and he returned to his native land . By starting a revolution among the ancient yeomen he finally forced the Danes to return to their own country , whereupon he himself was crowned King of Sweden . That was the beginning of that extraordinary era of national and international adventure which not only made this small and poverty-stricken land the champion of tilt Protestant cause in Europe , but which turned Sweden into the last bulwark against the ever-increasing threat of a Slavic invasion . For the Russians , after centuries of oblivion , had at last gone on the war-path and had commenced that famous march to the sea which has perhaps not yet come to an end . Sweden apparently was the only country which recognized the menace . During two whole centuries all her energies were concentrated upon one single purpose ? to keep Russia within bounds and away from the Baltic . In the end , of course , Sweden was bound to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it merely retarded the progress of the Russian steam-roller by a few decades . When it was over , Sweden , which had owned the greater part of the Baltic Sea coast , which had ruled Finland and Ingermanland ( where Leningrad is to-day ) , Esthonia , Livland , and Pomerania , had been reduced to a kingdom of the second  | rank , with an area of 173,000 square miles ( nearly twice Great Britain ) and a population slightly exceeding 6,000,000 . Half of this territory is still covered with forests , which in turn supply the timber needs of almost one half of the European continent . These trees are cut down in the winter and allowed to lie until after the beginning of spring . They are then dragged over the snow to the nearest river and are dumped into the gorge . When summer comes and the ice of the inland mountains begins to thaw , the rivers , turned into torrents , pick up the logs and carry them down into the valleys . The same river which has thus far acted as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which collect the logs and turn them into anything desired , from a match-stick to a lour-inch plank . By this time the Baltic has become free from ice , vessels can once more reach the different parts of the western coast , and the finished wood products , which thus far have cost very little , except for the wages of the lumbermen and the mill-hands , are now entrusted to the sailing-ships and steamships , which carry them to English and other foreign ports . These vessels serve a twofold purpose . They would be obliged to return in ballast unless they could pick up some sort of return cargo . Often they are unable to charge much for these return cargoes , and as a result Sweden gets most of its imports at a very reasonable rate . The same system is followed in handling the iron ore which is of such excellent quality that it is in high demand even in countries which have ore deposits of their own . As the country is nowhere wider than 25o miles , it is always comparatively easy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ near Kiruna , and Gallivara there are immense deposits of iron which Nature for some mysterious reason has planked down there right on the surface of the earth in the form of a couple of low mountains . In the summer the ore is taken to Lulea on the Gulf of Bothnia ( the northern part of the Baltic ) and in the winter , when Lulea is frozen fast , to Narvik in Norway , which , due to the North Atlantic Drift , remains open all the year round . Not far from these iron deposits lies one of Sweden 's highest  | mountains , Kebnekaise ( almost 7000 feet high ) , and there also stands one of the most important power houses of Europe . It is situated well within the Polar Circle , but since electricity seems to be indifferent about geographical latitudes , this station is able to run both the railways and the machinery of the surface mines at a very small cost . The southern part of Sweden , which got a little of that soil scraped off by the glaciers of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the entire Scandinavian peninsula and therefore the most densely populated . It has a great many lakes . As a matter of fact , Sweden , next to Finland , is the lakiest ' country in the world ; 14,000 square miles of it are covered with water . By connecting these lakes with canals , the Swedes have provided that whole part of their country with cheap means of communication , which greatly benefits not only the industrial centres like Norrkoping but also the harbours , of which Gothenburg and Malmo are the most important . There are countries in which Man has submitted to the dictates of Nature until he has become her abject slave , and there are countries where Man has destroyed Nature so completely that he has lost all touch with that great living mother who for ever must remain the beginning and the end of all things . And finally there are those where Man and Nature have learned to understand and appreciate each other and have agreed to compromise for their mutual benefit . If you want an example of the last named , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Scandinavian nations .  | THE NETHERLANDS , THE SWAMP ON THE BANKS OF THE NORTH SEA THAT BECAME AN EMPIRE THE word Netherlands , ' which is only used on very official occasions , means exactly what it implies , a combination of low ' localities situated from two to sixteen feet below the level of the sea . A single good flood of prehistoric dimensions , and Amsterdam and Rotterdam and all the most important cities would disappear from the face of the earth . But this apparent natural weakness of the country has also been the source of its greatest strength . For among these marshes along the banks of the North Sea it was not sufficient for Man to take hold of the country . Ere he could do that , he was obliged to create it , and in that uneven conflict between human ingenuity and the relentless forces of Nature , the Dutch people were triumphant . It taught them to be hard and watchful . In the sort of world in which we happen to live those qualities are not without merit . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they did about fifty years before the beginning of our era ) , the entire region consisted of bogs and marshes , protected against the ravages of the North Sea by that slender row of sand dunes which stretched all the way from Belgium to Denmark . These dunes were interrupted at irregular intervals by a large number of rivers and rivulets . Most important among the rivers were the Rhine , the Meuse , and the Scheldt . Left entirely to their own devices and not hindered by any dikes , these three rivers did exactly what they pleased , and every spring they altered their course and created islands where no islands had been before , and swept away vast tracts of land that had seemed as solid as the isle of Jersey . I am not exaggerating . Upon one memorable occasion in the 209  | thirteenth century , seventy villages and almost a hundred thousand people disappeared in the course of a single night . Compared to their Flemish neighbours who lived on solid ground , these early Hollanders lived a very miserable existence ; but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ water or the salt percentage of the Baltic , gave them their chance . One day , absolutely unexpectedly , the fish known as the herring moved from the Baltic into the North Sea . In an age when all the people of Europe were obliged to eat fish on Fridays and when fish as a staple diet of the human race was of much greater importance than it is to-day , this meant absolute ruin to a large number of Baltic cities and the sudden rise of a corresponding number of Dutch towns , which now began to supply southern Europe with that dried fish which then took the place of our tinned foods of to-day . Out of the herring fisheries came the grain trade , and out of the grain trade grew the commerce with the spice islands of India . There was nothing extraordinary in this . It was the normal development of a commercial State . But when fate , regardless of all practical considerations , incorporated the Low Countries into the empire of the Habsburgs and decreed that a nation of lusty peasants and fishermen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tough-fisted and very practical-minded , should be administered by sour officials trained at the Court of an absolute monarch who dwelt somewhere in dignified loneliness among the bleak hills of his windswept Spanish castle-land , then there was bound to be trouble . That trouble expressed itself in a struggle for liberty which lasted eighty years and which ended with a complete victory for the inhabitants of the Low Countries . The rulers of the newly-founded State , being practical men of affairs , believed sincerely in the principle of live and let live , especially when it meant a profit to them . They therefore offered their hospitality and their protection to Jews and Huguenots , who in less fortunate countries were being persecuted for their beliefs , religious or otherwise . Most of these refugees ( with the exception of a small group of obscure English dissenters , who however did not stay very long ) became loyal subjects of the country that had given them the chance to start upon a new and happier career . As  | a rule their former masters had deprived them of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they carried their old ability with them wherever they went , and they contributed most generously to the commercial and intellectual development of their adopted fatherland . And when the war of independence was over , a million people , living in little cities built on the bottom of some old lake or inland sea , boldly assumed the leadership of Europe and Asia and maintained that position for three generations . Then they invested their money ? bought themselves large country estates , foreign pictures ( which are of course always so much better than those painted by the talent at home ) , and spent their days being respectable . They did their best to make their neighbours forget where the money had come from , and very soon the money forgot to come too . For nothing in this world can afford to stand still , least of all our human energy . And those who wo n't make an effort to hold what they have got will soon lose all , and that goes for ideas as well as for ducats . The end came during the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only as much geography as he needed to win his battles , claimed that since the Low Countries were merely a delta formed by three French rivers , the Rhine , the Meuse , and the Scheldt , the country belonged by right of geological descent to the empire of the French . A large N scrawled at the bottom of a piece of paper undid the work of three entire centuries . Holland became a vassal kingdom under a Bonaparte king . In 1815 however the country regained its independence and went back to work . The colonial heritage , sixty-two times as large as the mother country , has allowed towns like Amsterdam and Rotterdam to maintain themselves quite successfully as centres for the distribution of Indian products . Holland has never been an industrial country . It has no raw materials , except a little coal of very indifferent quality in the extreme south-east . It is therefore not able to provide its own colonies with more than six per cent . of all their imports . But the development of the tea and coffee and rubber and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Borneo and the Celebes demands vast amounts of  | capital . This fact is responsible for the leading position of the Amsterdam stock exchange , and the importance of Amsterdam as a place where people and nations go to borrow money , while the necessity of carrying all this merchandise to and from Europe Caption makes it possible for the Netherlands to remain eighth on the list of ship-owning nations . The tonnage of the vessels used for the trade at home is higher than that of any other country . The country is honeycombed with convenient waterways , and the canal-boat is the most dangerous rival of the railway as it can be operated at a minimum of cost in a country where , until recently , the time element did not play a very important part in the daily affairs of men , women , cows , horses , and dogs .  | A great many of those canals are really drainage ditches , for one quarter of the kingdom 's territory is no land at all , in the usual sense of the word , but merely a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishes and the seals by endless labour and kept dry by artificial means and perpetual watchfulness . Since 1450 thousands of square miles of land have been added to the country Caption by the draining of marshes and by turning lakes into polders . ' To make such a polder is really very easy if you know how . First , you build a dike round the piece of water you have doomed to destruction and on the outside of that dike you dig a wide and deep canal , which is connected with the nearest river into which it can pour its daily surplus by means of a complicated system of locks . When that has been done , you construct a few dozen windmills on the top of that big dike and furnish them with a pumping machine . The wind or a small engine will then do the rest . When all the water has been pumped out of the lake and has been pumped into the canal , you dig a number of parallel ditches across  | your new polder and , provided you keep your pumping-mills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the necessary drainage . Some of these polders are quite large and are inhabited by as many as twenty thousand people . If the Zuyder Zee ever gets dried up there will be room for at least a hundred thousand more . As fully one-quarter of the country consists of such polders , you will easily understand how it happens that the Dutch Department of Rivers , Canals , and Dikes disposes of more money every year than any of the other sub-divisions of the Government . In strange contrast with the high fertility of this low part of the country , the higher regions of the east , where the central European plain met the sea before the formation of the big marshy delta of the Rhine and the Meuse and the Scheldt , is of very little use to anybody . For thousands of years it was an unloading station for the boulders and the pebbles of the northern European glaciers . In some ways the soil resembles that of New England , only it is much more sandy and it gives the statistics of the Kingdom of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a density of population of 625 per square mile ( France has only 191 , Russia 17 ) to carry a ballast of more than 25% of its total area as " territory which is essentially unproductive . " ( In France the percentage is less than fifteen , and in Germany less than nine . ) And this curiously sharp line of demarcation between east and west and fertile and infertile also accounts for the presence of the more important towns in a single small triangle right in the heart of the polder-land . Amsterdam , Haarlem , Leyden , The Hague , Delft , and Rotterdam are so close to each other as to form practically one large city , and they all lie close to the protecting bulwark of those famous sand dunes , at the foot of which the Dutch of three centuries ago began to cultivate and to perfect the pretty little bulbs of a flower which their merchants had brought back from the Levant . This flower was called in Turkish a tulband . The word meant a turban , from a fancied resemblance between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the Dutch changed it into tul p , whence the English tulip . Any wheezy old motor car will carry you from one end of Holland to the other in a few hours . And yet , if we except Attica , this narrow strip of land between the Rhine , the North Sea , and the Zuyder Zee has probably contributed more to the sum total of our arts and sciences than any other region of similar diminutive proportions . Athens was a barren rock , and Holland was a waterlogged swamp . But they had two things in common when they suddenly leaped into fame ? an excellent geographic situation from the point of view of international commerce , and a superabundance of animal spirits and spiritual curiosity , left over from the days when they had been obliged to fight or perish . And out of these their glory was born .  | GREAT BRITAIN , AN ISLAND OFF THE DUTCH COAST WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HAPPINESS OF FULLY ONE-QUARTER OF THE HUMAN RACE UNTIL a few years ago this chapter would have been entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the handiwork of Nature and turned a geographical unit into two separate entities . And all the obedient scrivener can do is to follow suit and give each of the two countries a separate chapter . Any other course might lead to far-reaching complications , and I would hate to see the Irish Navy sail up the Hudson River to demand an apology for this " insufferable insult to the national pride of Saorstat Eireann . " Dinosaurs drew no maps , but the rocks remained behind to tell their story . And they are all there ? the igneous rocks , volcanic products which got cooled off near the surface of the earth , and the granite , born under pressure , and the sedimentary rocks , slowly settling down along the bottoms of lakes and seas , and the metamorphic rocks , like slate and marble , which were really limestone and clay changed into more valuable materials by the subtle chemistry of the great depths . They are all there , lying about in disordered profusion , like the furniture in a house struck by a cyclone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest . They may account for the fact that England has given the world so many first-rate geologists . It may of course be the other way round : because there were a great many excellent geologists , we learned more about the geological formation of England than of any other country . But that hardly seems likely . Swimming champions are usually found near the water and rarely in the heart of the Kalahari Desert . And so the earth and rocks were there , and the geologists , the  | men whose calling it was to study the surface of the earth , were there ; and what did they tell each other about the origin of the land of their birth ? Try to forget the map of Europe as you have come to know it to-day . Imagine a world which has only recently emerged from below the surface of the sea , which is still rocking with the effort of creation . Picture to yourself vast continents rising high and bleak above the waters , rent asunder by eruptions that crush the rocks as a manhole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Meanwhile the forces of Nature 's laboratory continue their patient labours . Incessantly the winds blow from the ocean , carrying billions of tons of moisture on their way from west to east , drenching the land and giving it moisture , covering it with a wide blanket of grass and ferns , arranging for the maintenance of shrubs and trees . Day and night , and night and day , and year after year , the tireless waves beat and pound and grind and file and crunch and rasp until the shores of the land wilt and crumble as the snow melts and crumbles before the rays of the insistent sun . And then suddenly the ice ? the slow , merciless wall of death that groaningly hoists itself across the steepest side of the highest mountain-ranges , that rumbles ponderously down the slopes of wide valleys , that fills deep gorges and narrow ravines with frozen water and pieces of rock from the wasted hilltops . The sun shines ? the rain rains ? the ice cracks and creeps ? the waves gnaw ? the seasons follow each other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is what he finds . A long narrow strip of land , cut off from the rest of the world by a flooded valley  | which reaches all the way from the Arctic to the Bay of Biscay , another high plateau rising well above the waves and separated from the narrow strip by an unruly and choppy sea ? a few lonely rocks sticking out well above the surface of the sea , a perching place for gulls rather than a habitat for man . That vaguely , very vaguely , was the way England came into being . Now let us look at the modern map and see what that shows us . From the Shetland Islands to Land 's End is the same distance as from Oslo in Norway to Prague in Bohemia . That means that Great Britain ? i.e. , England , Scotland and Wales together ? with 45,000,000 people , one of the most densely populated countries in the world , is situated between the same degrees of latitude as the peninsula of Kamchatka ( opposite Alaska ) which also runs from about 5o ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 7000 people just about manage to keep themselves from starving by living on an exclusive diet of fish . On the east , England is bounded by the North Sea , which is really nothing but an old depression which has gradually filled with water . Again a single glimpse at the map will tell you more than a thousand words . To the south is France . Then we get something that looks like a trench across a road , the English Channel . Then the great central plain of England , with London in the south-east corner of it . Then the high mountains of Wales . Another depression , the Irish Sea , the great central Irish plain , the hills of Ireland , a few lonely rocks further towards the west , rearing their tops above the shallow sea . Finally the rock of St Kilda ( now uninhabited ) , and then suddenly down we go , down , down , down , for there the real ocean begins and the last of the vast European and Asiatic continent , both submerged and semisubmerged , comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bays and channels that surround England , I had better mention them in some detail . I have done my best not to clutter this book with unnecessary names which you would forget as soon as you had turned to the next page . But here we are on classical ground for this strange little country has influenced the life of every man , woman , and child on the entire  | planet for at least four centuries . That , however , has not been entirely a matter of chance or racial superiority . That the English have made the best of their opportunities is undoubtedly true . But Nature had given them a tremendous advantage when she placed their lovely land on the flank of the greatest amount of territory in the eastern hemisphere . If you want to realize what that means , think of poor Australia , isolated amid an endless expanse of water , left entirely to its own devices , with no large neighbours , with no chance of getting new ideas from anywhere . Of course this happy position meant nothing so long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the end of the tenth century England was a slightly remote land , holding about the same position in men 's minds as Iceland does to-day . Three or four days of seasickness ? that is what England meant to neighbours of the first ten centuries of our era ? and remember , a Roman galley was even less comfortable than a seven-hundredton steamer from Leith to Reykjavik . Gradually , however , the knowledge about these outskirts of civilization increased . The painted savages who lived in small round huts , sunk well into the ground and surrounded by a low earthen wall , were tamed by the Romans who , listening to their speech , came to the conclusion that they must belong to the same racial stock as the Celts of northern Gaul and who found them on the whole docile and willing to pay tribute without talking too much about their rights . ' It was doubtful anyway whether they had any rights ' to the soil they occupied , for it appeared almost certain that they were comparative newcomers and had taken the land away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could be found here and there among the less accessible regions of the east and west . The Roman occupation of England lasted , roughly speaking , four centuries , almost as long as the time during which the white man has been the dominating race in America . Suddenly Rome recalled her foreign garrisons ? all but a few regiments , which were left behind to guard the high wall which protected the plains of Britain from the invasions of the savages who dwelt  | among the impassable mountain-ranges of Scotland , and to keep watch over the boundaries of Wales . But presently the regular supply ships failed to come from across the water . That meant that Gaul had been lost to the enemy . From that moment the Romans in England were cut off from the mother country and connexions were never re-established . A little later news appeared from the coastal towns that foreign ships had been seen off the mouth of the Humber and the Thames , and that villages in Durham and York and Norfolk and Suffolk and Essex had been attacked and plundered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had not been necessary . But now some mysterious pressure ( whether hunger or wanderlust or an enemy in the rear we shall never know ) , which had pushed the advanceguard of the Teutons across the Danube and through the mountain passes of the Balkans and the Alps , was urging raiding parties of Saxon pirates from Denmark and Holstein to the shores of Britain . The Roman governors , the Roman garrisons , the Roman women and children who must have inhabited those charming villas of which we continue to find the remnants disappeared from view . They dissolved into space . Some of them were murdered by their own servants , and their women were married by kindhearted natives ? a strange fate for a proud race of conquerors , but one that has overtaken more than one group of colonials ' who neglected to take the last ship home . Thereafter chaos ? and groups of savage axe-men from Caledonia , industriously killing off their Celtic neighbours who had grown soft during the centuries when Rome had acted as the national and international policeman . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright idea that invariably spells ultimate disaster : " Let us call in a few strong men from somewhere else and hire them to do our fighting for us . " The strong men came from the marshes tells us nothing about their origin , for northern Germany was full of Saxons . Why they should have become associated with the Angles is  | another problem that will probably never be solved . The term Anglo-Saxon ' was invented centuries after they had made their first appearance upon the English scene . Anglo-Saxon ' is now a slogan : the Anglo-Saxon blood ' ? the Anglo-Saxon traditions . ' Well , one fairy story is as good as the next , and therefore if it makes people happy to think themselves superior to all other people , why not ? But the historian must regretfully announce that the Angles as a racial unit are the little brothers of the Lost Tribes of Israel ? they have often been mentioned in spurious chronicles of the past , but no one has been able with certainty to aver from whence they came . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ par with the hordes of northern European emigrants to America one might have seen in the steerage of an ocean liner of thirty years ago . But they were strong . They worked and fought and played and plundered with equal zest . They were given five centuries in which to organize the land over which they now ruled , and during that period they were able to force their own tongue upon the poor Celtic natives , who rapidly lost all recollection of the few Latin words they had picked up while working in the kitchen of some noble Roman lady . Then they in turn were thrown out of house and home by still another wave of Teuton immigrants . In io66 England became a Norman dependency , and for a third time the British Isles were forced to acknowledge a sovereign from over the seas . Soon , however , the tail was wagging the dog . The British colony proved to be a more profitable investment than the temporary motherland in France , and many Normans settled down in England for good . England did not become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But all through the feudal ages the forces were at work which made her into one . Though in theory both the barons and the bishops looked down on the merchants and affected to despise trade , in practice they did a good deal to foster commerce . The Plantagenet kings by giving charters to walled towns and by patronizing the London City Companies played their part . No doubt the fact that several of these spendthrift gentlemen were only too glad to borrow money at high rates of interest from wealthy Lord Mayors and Aldermen had something to do with  | their polite attitude ! Owing to the heavy losses suffered by the old knightly families in the Crusades and in the Hundred Years War many cadets , or younger sons , of such families were fain to bind themselves apprentices to London merchants . Foreign craftsmen , such as the Flemish weavers , were encouraged by Edward III to come and settle in his dominions , and Henry V , the victor of Agincourt , had very clear-cut notions about the importance to England of a strong navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had probably less to do with England 's rapid rise as a trading power than had the actions of another and a very different Henry , Henry VIII , him of the six wives . When Henry fell in love with Anne Boleyn , and divorced his Spanish queen in order to marry her , he quarrelled with the Pope and with Spain . England had to learn to stand on her own legs . She had no friend either in Rome or in Madrid . Then there came a time when it looked as if Spain might pick up this little , grey-green , rainy land and all its stubborn , sturdy inhabitants , and put them in her pocket . But that was not to be . Elizabeth , Anne Boleyn 's redhaired only daughter , came to the throne . Elizabeth 's seamen sailed all the seas then known to man ? they defied the Don in his strongholds in the New World , they opened up ocean-paths of profit and adventure , and they took a long step towards making their country what she afterwards became ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the year over Britain the winds blew ( and continue to blow ) from the west , which meant rain . To-day agriculture , as I told you when we talked of the northern European States , is no longer as absolutely dependent upon Nature as it used to be a thousand or even a hundred years ago . We ca n't as yet make rain , but the chemical engineer has taught us how to overcome many difficulties which the contemporaries of Chaucer and Queen Bess accepted as acts of God against which there was neither remedy nor redress . There again the geological structure of the island proved a great boon to the landowners of the east . A cross-section of the British Isles shows that they resemble two or three books lying flat but which have slipped and remain sloping , with the back of one on the edge of the other , but tilted  | much higher in the west than in the east . It is a result of the fact , mentioned before , that Britain is part of a very old continent , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been entirely worn away by water and wind , while the rock formations of the west , although very old , are still standing upright and wo n't be gone before another ten or fifteen million years . These mountains which occupy the territory called Wales ( one of the last Caption strongholds of the original Celtic tongues ) act as a fence to break the force of the Atlantic rainstorms ere they reach the lowlands of the east , and they temper their violence so successfully that the great eastern plain enjoys an almost ideal climate for the purpose of cultivating grain and breeding cattle . Since the invention of the steam-boat , which allows us to order our grain from the Argentine or Canada , and since the introduction of cold storage for the purpose of transporting frozen meats from one end of the world to the other , no nation , able to pay the price , is any longer dependent upon its own farms and fields for the purpose of feeding the home population . But until a hundred years ago , the owners of the food @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they decided to lock the doors of their  | larder , millions of people died a slow death of starvation . The wide plain bounded by the English Channel in the south , the Severn in the west ( the river that divides Wales from England and runs into the Bristol Channel ) , the Humber and Mersey in the north , and the North Sea in the east was therefore the most important part of the old England , for it produced the greatest amount of food . Of course , when I speak of a plain , ' I do not mean a plain in the American sense of the word . The great central English plain is no flat pancake like Kansas , but consists of a rolling landscape . The river Thames runs through the heart of it . The Thames takes its origin among the Cotswold hills , famous for their sheep and near the city of Bath , where ever since the days of the Romans the victims of British cookery have come together to partake of the hot calcium and sodium baths and fortify @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetables . The Thames then flows between the Chiltern hills and the White Horse hills , provides the University of Oxford with a convenient water supply for its rowing experiments , and finally enters the lower Thames valley , situated between the low hills of the East Anglian Ridge and the North Downs , which would run all the way to France if the Strait of Dover had not eaten its way through this soft chalky substance in its laudable effort to connect the Atlantic with the North Sea . It is on this river that the world 's biggest town is situated . Like Rome and most other cities that go back to obscure and remote dates , the city of London was not an accident or the result of a sovereign 's whim . It was situated where it stands to-day as a result of sheer economic necessity . In order to get from southern England to northern England without being dependent upon the proverbially bad goodwill ' of the nefarious tribe of ferrymen , it was necessary to construct a bridge . And London arises at the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not too wide to allow the engineers of twenty centuries ago to build something that would safely carry people and merchandise from one shore to the next without getting their feet wet . When the Romans left , a great many things were changed in  | the British Isles , but London remained behind , and to-day , with more than 8,000,000 population , it covers an area five times as large as Babylon , the biggest city of antiquity , and four times as large as that of Paris . Caption The heart of London , the city , ' is now merely a workshop . In 1800 it still had 130,000 inhabitants . The number has since shrunk to less than 14,000 . But every day almost half a million people come down to the city to administer the billions of capital which England , out of her vast surplus wealth , has invested in foreign enterprises , and to supervise the distribution of those almost incredible quantities of colonial products which lie heaped up in  | the storehouses stretching all the way from Tower Bridge to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thames must remain open to traffic all the time , the only way to handle the shipping was by building docks and warehouses along both sides of the river . Americans who want to know what international commerce really means should visit these London docks . It will give them the feeling that New York is after all still some sort of a provincial village , a little too far removed from the main highways of trade . Eventually this may change ; the centre of commerce seems to be moving westward . But London still is supreme in her knowledge of the technique of foreign trade , while New York is only beginning to learn the rudiments . But I am digressing and must return for a moment to the English plain ' of 1500 . Its entire southern rim consisted of hills . In the extreme west lay Cornwall and Devon , similar in many ways to Brittany , from which it was separated by the English Channel . Cornwall is a curious land where the Celtic tongue maintained itself until two centuries ago , and where strange stone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ support the theory that once upon a time all these regions must have been inhabited by people of the same race . Cornwall , by the way , was the first part of England to be discovered by the sailors from the Mediterranean . The Phoenicians in their quest of lead and zinc and copper ( remember that they flourished at the beginning of the metal age ) used to come as far north as the Scilly Islands . There they met the savages from the fog-bound mainland and did their bartering . Beyond Cornwall lies the Bristol Channel , the Wrong Channel ' of the maps of the seventeenth century because skippers who returned from America were very apt to mistake it for the English Channel and were then shipwrecked among these treacherous waters where the tide may rise as high as forty feet . North of the Bristol Channel lie the mountains of Wales . They were of no great importance to anybody until the discovery of their coal and iron beds and of the copper deposits of the nearby island of Anglesey which turned that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire kingdom . Cardiff , an  | old Roman fort , is now one of the greatest coal centres of the world . It is connected with London by a railway which dives underneath the river Severn . This tunnel has gained almost as much fame in engineering circles as the bridge which connects the mainland of Wales with the island of Anglesey and the island of Holyhead , from where one starts for Kingstown , a port for the city of Dublin . This ancient quadrangle of England , where every city and village is so hoary with age and history that I almost fear to mention their names lest I be tempted to make this a geography of England rather than of the whole world , has until this day remained the backbone of the landowning classes . In France , where large estates are not absolutely unknown but rather rare , there are ten times as many landowners as in this part of Britain . In Denmark the proportional difference is even greater . That this class of country squires has lost so much of its former importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own but rather to that change in our economic life brought about by the invention of the steam-engine by James Watt . When that mathematically inclined instrument maker of the University of Glasgow began to play with his grandmother 's tea-kettle , steam was still a plaything used to work a few slow and laborious pumps . When he died , steam ruled supreme , and land was no longer the main source of riches . It was then , during the first forty years of the last century , that the centre of economic gravity , which since the beginning of history had lain in the south , moved northward to Lancashire , where steam set the cotton mills of Manchester a-spinning in the moist air , and to Yorkshire , where steam turned Leeds and Bradford into the woollen centres of the whole world , and made Sheffield the breeding-place for all those millions of tons of steel plates and girders which were needed to build the ships that must carry the finished products of the British Isles to the ends of the earth . The upheaval caused by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formidable revolution mankind had experienced . The engines , of course , were not able to think for themselves , and they needed a certain number of human attendants  | to feed them and tend them and tell them when it was time to begin and to stop . In return for such very simple services , the farm hands were promised what to them seemed riches . The country people listened to the lure of the city . The cities grew by leaps and bounds , and within a remarkably short space of time eighty per cent . of the country population had moved to the towns . It was then that England accumulated that vast surplus wealth which will keep her going long after all her other assets shall have been exhausted . Many people nowadays ask themselves whether that point has actually been reached . Time only will tell ? time , meaning the next ten or twenty years . But it will be very interesting to see what happens . SCOTLAND The Romans knew of the existence of the Scots . Somewhere in the north , beyond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Northumbrian hovels , there lay a land of inhospitable mountains inhabited by rough tribes of shepherds and sheepowners . They dwelt in almost legendary simplicity , counted descent through the mother , instead of through the father as the greater part of the world did , had no roads except a few trails almost too steep for a horse , and had resisted all efforts to civilize them with such ferocious violence that the best policy had seemed to be that of leaving them strictly alone . But as they were also formidable cattle-thieves , and had a way of suddenly descending from their mountains to steal the sheep of the Cheviot hills and the cows of Cumberland , it was considered wise to protect these regions by building a high wall running all the way from the Tyne to the Solway . This was done , and during the four centuries of Roman domination in England the Scots , with the exception of a few punitive expeditions , were rarely exposed to the blessings of civilization . They continued their old commercial relations with their Celtic cousins in Ireland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in contact with the rest of the world . Little of the ancient Roman wall remains , but even to-day the Scots live very much a life of
