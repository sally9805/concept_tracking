To the Hebraic incantations of Elohim and Adonai a sacred promise was made in Detroit one night last week . The Jew Sender ben Henie swore before Jehovah that , if his unborn child should be a girl , he would marry her to the son of his faithful neighbor Nissen . But Nissen died leaving his son poor while Sender grew rich and increasingly greedy . The holy promise was broken , just as it was in Sholom Ansky 's mystical drama . This time The Dybbuk was having its U. S. premiere as an opera , which has had considerable success during the past two years in Europe . The music was by Italian Composer Lodovico Rocca , who spent four years in Palestine studying Hebrew moods and chants . The first production in English was proudly staged last week by Detroit 's Civic Opera in Masonic Auditorium . <P> On a stage strangely dark the pact between Sender and Nissen was pledged in such a leisurely prolog that many a Detroiter shifted uneasily , began to fear for the evening to come . First act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a synagog . Comics were the bearded batlans who droned their prayers for a kopek or two , spent their earnings on vodka . A tragic , pale-faced figure was Hanan , Nissen 's son , torn between the Talmud and the cabalistic mysticism which used to be feared by all good Jews . By prayers and fasting Hanan had hoped finally to win Sender 's daughter Leah . Instead he dropped dead calling on the unholy powers as Sender appeared , rowdily announcing Leah 's betrothal to a rich merchant 's son . <P> Because the opera was supposed to be in English , the advance libretto sale had been light . But during intermission hundreds of Detroiters rushed into the lobby , glad to pay for some guide to its meaning . The second act spoke more eloquently for itself . Scene was the village square on the day of the marriage ceremonies . All the ghetto rabble was there , begging for alms , food , drink . One gay interlude came when a ragged peasant orchestra evoked a reedy little tune from the big band in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ danced madly while Leah swept in to whirl despairingly with a groveling hunchback , a hideous , pawing old crone . Rocca 's orchestra reached a frenzied climax as Leah faced her bridegroom , suddenly screamed like one gone mad . Just as abrupt was the hush when the verdict was passed . " A dybbuk has her ... a dybbuk , a dybbuk . . . . " Curtain went down with every instrument in the orchestra simulating the horror of that dread word . <P> According to ancient Hebrew lore a dybbuk is the restless spirit of one who has died committing a sin . Such a spirit , it once was believed , could return to earth , take heathenish possession of an innocent mortal . In the opera last week it was the tortured Hanan who bewitched Leah . To exorcise his spell she was led before an ancient rabbi to whom Sender admitted his treachery , gladly consented to renounce half his riches . Persistent prayers were said over Leah , who dropped lifeless when Hanan 's spirit left her . Finale came with their love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroiters cheering to their feet .
