txt Professor Aminta Milani , the physician who has been in sole charge of the health of Pope Pius since he took to his bed on Dec. 4 , showed himself distinctly optimistic in speaking to this correspondent tonight in the first interview he has granted to the press . He refused to commit himself in 1 any way about the Pontiff 's chances 1 of ultimate recovery , but stated positively there was no immediate danger to his life . Ail the specific symptoms have improved , he said , I and the Pope 's greatest danger is his advanced age , which renders 1 any prognostication very uncertain . " You may reassure the world , " he said , " that the Holy Father 's life is in no immediate danger . At the beginning of his illness I was seriously alarmed because his heart was very weak and I did not know whether it would resist . His heart , however , has stood the strain of his prolonged illness better than I had any right to expect . Therefore the prospects are very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Asked whether he thought the Pope 's illness would be a long one , Professor Milani said : - " I prefer to say it will not be a short one . His heart , as I have said , is behaving very well , and the asthma and the infection in the Holy Father 's leg are infirmities due to old age and are not dangerous to his life . They show a slight improvement , but his general condition , unfortunately , remains stationary . Senectus ipsa morbus est , ' old age itself is an illness , one against which we doctors can do nothing . " Pope 's Orders Followed Professor Milani confirmed that it is the Pope 's express wish that as little fuss as possible be made in the press about his illness . " He does not wish any one to make much of it , " said the papal physician , who had some bitter i words to say about the people who I have attacked him in the Italian press for not holding consultations and not issuing daily bulletins . Whatever has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , has been in obedience to the Pontiff 's orders . In any case , no regular bulletins will be issued unless grave complications set in . Asked about reports spread abroad that the Pope 's left leg may be amputated because gangrene had set in , Professor Milani termed them ridiculous , as well as the report that the Pope is suffering from diabetes in addition to his other ailments . As for the special wheel chair ordered by the Pope , Professor Milani said there was no im ? mediate prospect of its being used . " The Holy Father must stay in bed , " he said . " And he must stay there till he is completely recovered , ' which will be a long time from now . " Professor Milani attributes the Pope 's present condition mainly to his refusal to take proper care of himself . " All the present ailments could have been prevented or checked if he had been taken in hand soon enough . Unfortunately , he has never allowed me to cure him , and that is also the reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After a few hours of troubled sleep last night the Pontiff awoke in the morning neither noticeably better nor noticeably worse than the day previous . The asthma had improved and except for recurrent twinges of pain in the left leg- all his specific symptoms had subsided to a point where they caused no immediate alarm . The Pope had great difficulty falling asleep last night not so much owing to the pain in his left leg as because he was agitated ' andrestless . The Papal physician who visited him shortly before midnight did not think , however , that it was advisable to administer a sedative , believing that if the Pope could get some sleep without artificial aid he would derive greater benefit from it . Had a Restless Night Till 3 in the morning the Pope frequently required attention of a monk on duty as a nurse . Then he dozed off . He was restless all night , however , and woke more than once . The result was that he slept later than usual and was still asleep when the physician called at 6:30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at 7 and stayed till 8 . As soon as his physician left him the Pope listened from his bed while Mgr . Venini said mass in the adjoining chapel and gave him holy communion . Then he received Cardinal Pacelli , the Papal Secretary of State , about an hour later and granted a few minutes ' audience to Mgr . Chollet , Archbishop of Cambrai , with whom he spoke briefly about the affairs of his archdiocese . The rest of the morning he attended to his correspondence with his two private secretaries . In the afternoon he alternately dozed and listened while his secretaries read to him Speaking to Cardinal Pacelli , the Pope expressed his gratitude and appreciation for the prayers being said for him throughout the world . He said that if he can not recover he hopes he will at least be spared a long illness , because he dreads the possibility that he may suffer the same fate- as his brother , who died of paralysis some years ago after hanging on for months between life and death : . He feared a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as for the Catholic Church , which may suffer severe damage through not having some one at its head who can dedicate his whole time to the many urgent affairs requiring attention . Persons who attend the Pontiff in his present illness say that though he bears his suffering with admirable fortitude he has lost his customary joviality and has become taciturn and morose . This hardly can be wondered at , in view of all the pain to which he has submitted without complaint . He has decided to dedicate his last days entirely to the church , refusing to see any one outside the church in order to preserve his strength for interviews necessary to keen Vatican affairs going May Create Cardinals According to rumors circulating In Vatican circles  --  rumors lacking official confirmation  --  the Pope intends to hold a consistory soon for the creation of two Cardinals . The consistory will be held in his bedroom and attended only ' ay the Cardinals who are the heads of the three orders of Cardinals and who would represent all the rest . The two Cardinals who would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Venice 's Patriarch , and Mgr . Pizzardo , Deputy Secretary of State for Extraordinary Ecclesiastical Affairs . Mgr . Pizzardo would be made prefect of a new congregation created at the same time to concern itself with the management and the development of Catholic Action organizations throughout the world . An element of doubt is cast on these reports by the fact that the two new Cardinals would bring the membership of the Sacred College up to its theoretical maximum of seventy which would be a most unusual . perhaps unprecedented , situation . The practice in fact is to leave two or three college seats unoccupied in order that the new Pope may , on his election , immediately raise up to the purple any prelate he considers worthy of that distinction . Cardinal Dougherty of Philadelphia , who has been appointed Cardinal Legate to the Eucharistic Congress at Manila , arrived in Rome this evening from Naples . He will be received by the Pope in the course of the next few days and will leave Rome on his mission January 10 . Pope Rests More Easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jan. 3 . ? Pope Pius XI was declared to be resting more comfortably early this morning after he had suffered great pain during the first part of the night . Sources close to the Vatican said the Pontiff had begun to rest about 3:15 A. M. 9:15 P. M. Saturday in New York after a siege of pain . Their report came after two welldressed civilians , whose identities were not officially disclosed , had been taken to the Vatican by automobile . Watchers said they believed the civilians were specialists called by Professor Aininta . Milani , the Pope 's chief physician , for consultations on the possibility of administering stronger medicines to induce sleep . The civilians arrived at 2:30 A. M. and left within thirty minutes . Diplomats accredited to the Vatican presented yesterday messages from their Kings and Presidents . conveying sympathy for the Pontiff and wishes for his restoration to health .
