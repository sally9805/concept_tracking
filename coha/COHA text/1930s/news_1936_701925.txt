txt Duty Many people , otherwise highly intelligent , are prone to take the attitude that " politics is dirty business . " Is it not the part a wisdom to remember that politics is the science of government and that in a government like ours an election places upon every citizen a duty to think carefully and to vote according to his best judgment , honestly arrived at ? Politics is not " dirty business " when it is in the capable hands of honest , public-spirited , far-sighted men ; and it is the high privilege and the duty of voting Americans to place government in such hands . And it is a simple but fearful fact that our democracy can not survive unless the rank and file of American citizens can find such men and will put the powers of government into such hands. ?
