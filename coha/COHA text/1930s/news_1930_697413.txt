txt Judge Amedeo A. Bertini of Gen , eral Sessions refused to waive im- , community yesterday when called before the special Ewald grand jury to explain a $100,000 transaction that followed his appointment , but denied any intention of resigning . His refusal to testify came as Special Prosecutor Hiram C. Todd sought corroboration of evidence that Judge Bertini 's nomination by the Democratic County Committee had been dictated by John F. Curry , leader of Tammany Hall . Soon after Judge Bertini left the county court house , an angry , flustered figure , - with a ! booing crowd at his heels , Mr. Todd began preIparing subpoenas for the bank accounts of men prominent in Tammany Hall and in the world of sports . Although Governor Roosevelt announced in Albany that he would repeat his demand upon Attorney General Ward for the minutes of the grand jury relative to Judge Bertini with a view to considering removal proceedings before the Senate , it was unlikely that any move would he made toward compliance until next week . Supreme Court Justice Philip J. McCook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right to know what the grand jury has learned about his appointment of Judge Bertini , left immediately after adjourning court for Niantic , Conn. , and is not expected to return until Tuesday . Meanwhile the Governor has the right to convene the Senate without waiting for the evidence to be turned over to him . Senator John Knight , majority leader of the Senate , learned of Judge Bertini 's refusal to waive imrverity , in Buffalo , where he spent the day . He would agree to the calling of a special session of the upper house if the Governor wished to have the Senate consider the case , he said . Mid-November was suggested by him as the most suitable time for the Senate to meet . " Fixer " Charges Sifted . Durin : the day a report became current that the Appellate Division 's inquiry into the magistrates ' courts was being directed toward an organization operating from a midtown hotel which was said to have arranged for the " fixing " of charges against violators , most of them petty , ones , such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Isidore J. Kresel , special counsel in the inquiry , questioned Ben Miller , head of the Ben Miller Association , described as a social organization with headquarters in the Hotel Claridge , and of the Ben Miller Service Company , a garage at 512 Seventh Avenue , who appeared at the office of the investigators with a volume of the records of his organization . Mr. Tibbetts refused to reveal the reason Miller had been called or the nature of the questions asked him . The Citizens Union , which has agreed to finance the wide grand jury inquiry which Governor Roosevelt declined to sanction , issued a public appeal for funds , declaring that the " rottenness " already disclosed had undermined public confidence in the courts and asserting that the present criminal investigation must go on so that the statute of limitations could not be used to ' " protect the guilty parties in tho barter of public office . " Curry 's Records Sought . The subpoenas being prepared by Mr. Todd , it became known , call among others for the bank records of Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in which Judge B , natini lives and director of the city budget . Other records subpoenaed. include those of Humbert Fugazy. sports promoter and a boyhood friend of the little-known lawyer. : whose sudden elevation to a high ? court post caused surprise in politi4 cal circles a year ago , when he wa named to succeed former Judg Francis X. Mancuso , who had been indicted in the City Trust scandal . Investigators of Mr. Todd 's staf also evinced a pronounced interest in the dealings of Austin E. Titus who before he was appointed Secretary to the Police Departmen by former Police Commissioner Whalen was a familiar figure at City Hall . He had been trying for years to make a contract with the city on behalf of the Titus Water Engineering Company to relieve the water shortage in Queens . His plan was defeated under a storm of protest stirred up by Leonard Wallstein , counsel to the Citizens Union , and it was reported at the time that Mayor Walker had given him a berth in the Police Department to make up for his disappointment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was learned , to ascertain how frequently Mr. Titus called at Judge Bertini 's chambers and whether Henry Snyder , Judge Bertini 's confidential clerk , who has been subpoenaed and who will refuse to waive immunity , ever had any financial dealings with him . The turn the investigation has taken recalled an incident that took place soon after Mr. Titus joined the Police Department during the investigation into the murder of Frank Marlow , a Broadway racketeer . During the inquiry it developed that Fugazy had been in the midtown restaurant from which Marlow was summoned and taken for " a ride . " With him was a detective who failed to report the fact to Commissioner Whalen , and who subsequently was chided for his omission by his chief . Before Fugazy vias questioned , it was revealed that Mr. Titus had visited the sports promoter at his office with the detective who had been Fugazy 's guest the night of the murder . Mr. Titus , at his home , 260 Dover Street , said last night that Fugazy v.-as a " friend and neighbor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was " proud to call him my friend . " He was at a loss to know why the Attorney General 's office was interested in him , denied having had anything to do with Judge Bertini 's appointment and said he would be glad to waive immunity and testify any time . Bertini Nomination Under Fire . Following Governor Roosevelt 's explanation that he appointed Judge Bertini because the regular Democratic organization of New York County had nominated him and because Maurice Bloch , late minority leader of the Assembly , had vouched for his qualifications , Mr. Todd 's assistants centred their inquiry upon the meeting of the Tammany executive committee at which the judge was nominated . Evidence has reached the Attorney General 's office , it was understood , that Mr. Curry , who has refused to waive immunity , had arranged before the meeting was held that the candidate backed by Kohler should get the post . It was done as all such things are done , it is understood , at preliminary conferences ancl. , ? by bargaining with the district leaders who make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to be presented to the grand jury in legal form is a question . The district leaders have refused to waive immunity . Mr. Bloch is dead , as is William J. Duffy , secretary of Tammany Hall at the time . It was the difficulty of obtaining first-hand testimony , from principals , that led Mr. Todd to decide upon a wholesale examination of bank accounts . Some financial records already have been obtained . Accountants going over the bank records of Snyder , who was a confidential clerk to former Judge Mancuso and who continued in the same capacity under Judge Bertini , have discovered a gift of a large sum of money from the jurist last Spring . Snyder explained in a statement now in the possession of Mr. Todd 's assistants that the gift represented the profit on a stock transaction by Judge Bertini . Investigators are seeking to learn what services Snyder performed to lead Judge Bertini to reward him so handsomely . Snyder 's statement indicates that at the time he made it he was asked several questions relative to his knowledge of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Justice Joseph F. Crater , who disappeared when the first charges of office buying were made public against former Magistrate George F. Ewald , Mr. Kohler and Mr. Curry . He also was asked to tell on what occasions he cashed checks for Judge Bertini and to whom they were made out . Bertini Scouts Resignation . Before appearing before the grand jury , Judge Bertini , presiding over his own courtroom , sentenced one man to Sing Sing for four years , suspended sentence on four other prisoners who appeared before him and adjourned the cases of four other defendants who appeared before him for sentence . The harassed judge 's appearance at the County Court House was a dramatic incident of the grand jury sermon . Before leaving the Criminal Courts Building , he summoned reporters to his chambers and said : " It is usual for you to do the questioning . Now I am going to do it . Look me straight in the eye and tell me if I look like the kind of man who has done anything wrong . " Nobody replied , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had resigned or intended to resign . All reports of that nature are absolutely false . I have no intention of resigning . " A little later he appeared at the County Court House with one of his court attendants . They waved a hasty hello to Snyder , and Judge Bertini disappeared behind the doors of the grand jury room . Six minutes later he was out again and on his way to the street level in an elevator reserved for the use of judges . Photographers piled down the stairs after him . They overtook him in front of the Tombs . The court attendant waved his arms in front of the judge 's face , which was flushed and angry . The fact that there already are many newspaper photographs in existence seemed to make no difference as the judge , mumbling to his companion to " step on it , " broke into a dog trot . Traffic was stopped outside the Tombs and Judge Bertini made a dive for a taxicab , only to be thrust off by the driver , who explained in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Judge Bertini tried a second taxicab , but that was stalled in traffic behind a truck . He piled out again as the photographers prepared to " shoot . " flpying a policeman on guard outside the Tombs , Judge Bertini made known his identity and asked him to asked Justice McCook 's permission to turn over the grand jury 's minutes to Governor Roosevelt . It was pointed out that if he were to resign now there would be no need for removal proceedings before the Senate and the Governor would have no basis for his request for the grand jury 's evidence . On the other hand , if he resigned after the Governor obtained the evidence there still would be no need for a special session of the Senate . Todd Denounces Jurist . Later after Mr. Todd had declared that Judge Bertini 's refusal to waive immunity placed him in the same category as the Tammany leaders who , he said , cast suspicion upon themselves by their refusal to accept his terms of testifying . Judge Bertini was found in consultation with Max Hirson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the fifty-first story of the Woolworth Building . Only three other witnesses testified before the grand jury adjourned until Tuesday . They were Mrs. Hirson , wife of the judge 's former law partner , John J. Meyer , a Steuben Society member , who endorsed the appointment of former Magistrate Ewald , and George Stern , through whose testimony it was believed a link might be shown between Martin J. Healy , indicted Tammany leader , and the Board of Standards and Appeals . After leaving the grand jury room Mr. Stern told reporters that Healy had nothing to do with the success of his application before the board for a gasoline station and insisted that the $2,000 note he gave Healy , and about which he refused to answer until he was threatened with jail for contempt , was in no way connected with the transaction . " There was no politics in it . " said Stern , who is a member of the Cayuga Club , of which nearly all the political figures involved in the Ewald case were members . A report that Governor Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about his appointment of Judge Bertini and Justice Crater was ridiculed by persons closely associated with the Attorney General 's office . No such action was contemplated , it was said . s shoo the photographers away . The e policeman , however , merely took one of the judge 's arms , while the court attendant took the other . Then all three strode with long strides toward f the door of the Criminal Courts Building and the sanctuary of Judge Bertini 's chambers , the policeman touching his cap as they reached the door . A crowd followed the three t from the Tombs to the court house booing and hissing the angry judge . It was learned on good authority late last night that Judge Bertini will Prosecutor uonrtil ftermar.raSe Ward Citizens Union Appeal . Following is the appeal for funds issued by the Citizens Union , which is preparing to organize a staff of assistants and investigators to assist Mr. Todd as a special assistant of Attorney General Ward serving without pay to investigate alleged violations of the elective franchise law : " A serious crisis confronts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the select:on of certain judicial officers has been shown to undermine public confidence in the local judiciary . It is unthinkable that any public official , by act or omission , shall be permitted to prevent the exposure and punishment of every guilty participant in the purchase and sale of public office , " The need of the moment is for funds to enable the Citizens Union to assist in the investigation now under way . It is vital that the statute of limitations shall not be permitted to protect the guilty parties in the barter of public office . " To that end the Citizens Union appeals to the public-spirited people of New York for a fund of $20,000 to assist in the investigation which the Attorney General is conducting before the extraordinary grand jury into charges of the purchase and sale of public office in this county , in order that the important public service they have begun may be carried to completion . " Checks may be sent to the order of the Citizens Union , 177 William Street , New York City .

The witnesses , all of whom have been or will be called before the special grand jury are : Healy , Ewald and Thomas T. Tommaney , the district leader 's " right-hand man " ; Menehem Stimm , Peter Eckert , Emmerich Boczor . David Maier , John Mara , John Meyer , Arthur Hartman , Roger Broessel , Octavus Spennrath , Jacob Cash , Jac M. Wolff , former Magistrate Charles Oberwager , Grover C. Hill , Isaac Gabriel , George Schaeffer and Herbert Roth . Healy , Ewald , Tommaney and Mrs. Bertha E. Ewald have been indicted by the special grand jury for officebuying . All had refused to waive immunity and had been excused from testifying.                    @
