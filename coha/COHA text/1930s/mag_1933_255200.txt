When Depression nipped him in 1930 , Cyrus Stephen Eaton had realized only one of his many ambitions . Out of a tiny utility property picked up cheap in the 1907 panic he had built one of the largest power &; light systems in the U. S. He had wanted to form the Second Biggest Steel Company . As the largest investor in the largest rubber companies he had planned to bring peace to that warring industry . But . above all . this youngish man from Pugwash . Nova Scotia dreamed of a Midwest industrial empire , vast , powerful , autonomous . His holding company was appropriately Continental Shares , Inc . Without a trace of sarcasm Cleveland used to call him Cyrus the Great . <P> It was Cyrus Eaton 's fight against the Bethlehem-Youngstown merger that blasted his fame &; fortune . He wanted Youngstown for his own big Republic Steel but the battle was fought in the name of industrial independence for the Midwest . To finance that battle Continental Shares pledged most of its assets for bank loans . The Eaton victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loans under water and Cleveland bankers ousted him as president in favor of George Taylor Bishop , a semi-retired financier . Cyrus Eaton disappeared from the headlines as completely as if he had died . Last week bushy-browed old President Bishop was making a last stand against his creditors ' determination to sell what remained of Continental 's shriveled assets . Week before he sought in vain to enjoin Chase National from auctioning off the stocks pledged for a $27,000,000 loan .. <P> Chase itself bought in practically all the collateral for $22,700,000 . Included were 95,000 shares of Republic Steel , 50,000 shares of Cliffs Corp . ( iron ore ) , 98,400 shares of Firestone Tire , 77,000 shares of Goodyear , 62,000 shares of U. S. Rubber . 55,000 shares of Goodrich , 350,900 shares of Lehigh Coal &; Navigation and working control of United Light &; Power . What Chase intends to do with these new possessions Chase would not tell last week . <P> Two groups of Ohio banks , headed by Cleveland Trust Co. and Union Trust Co. , intend to auction off their collateral @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass to outside bidders . President Bishop , who is one of Continental 's biggest stockholders , mourned last week : " Nothing will be left for shareholders of Continental if all the securities which the corporation has pledged for loans are sold at present prices . " Some stockholders paid $40 a share . <P> Thus the final dissolution of Cyrus Eaton 's empire seemed inevitable . Yet like many another onetime tycoon Cyrus Eaton lives on in a manner which wholly belies his business disasters . He has abandoned his palatial Euclid Avenue house ( along with other Clevelanders who shared his faith ) but at his country home in nearby Northfield a butler still answers the door , stable boys mind the horses and a half-dozen gardeners putter around the 200-acre estate , and he is still Master of Hounds at the Summit Hunt Club . He has a small office in vastly-deflated Otis &; Co. , his old investment banking firm , but his business activities , if any , are a mystery to Cleveland .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
