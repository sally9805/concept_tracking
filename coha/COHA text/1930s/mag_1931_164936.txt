Dry Hoovers <P> Sirs : <P> In TIME of May 4 , subject , The Presidency , referring to the attendance of the President of the U. S. and Mrs. Hoover at the Cape Henry Pilgrimage , extract , " President Hoover got soaked . " . . . <P> Raincoats and umbrellas were provided against just such an emergency , which was not unanticipated . Rear Admiral Burrage , Commandant of the Norfolk Naval District ( and with the members of his staff , each a subscriber to TIME ) had detailed Warren Owens , a Coxswain in the Navy , as orderly to the President to be on hand with the raincoats and umbrellas if necessity arose . While it is true that almost all the Pilgrims were pretty well soaked , the President and Mrs. Hoover , through timely preparedness , suffered little . <P> C. E. CONEY <P> Lieut . U. S. N. <P> Aide to the Commandant Norfolk , Va . <P> <P> Wounded Narcissist <P> Sirs : <P> I am , as your critic suggests in his review of My Flesh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more astounded by his accusation that I am " heavily humorless ' ' ( TIME , May 11 ) . Among the gifts which I have received from the fates I value none more than my funny bone . It is because of the delightful humor with which you manage to present the news that I enjoy TIME so immensely . But I do n't like your review of my autobiography . <P> Your critic speaks of the " many ponderous plums " which can be " pulled out of this ( my ) heavy Teutonic pudding . " I like plum pudding but I always thought that it was an English , not a Teutonic dish . His description of me " thick-spectacled , thick-lipped and thick-nosed " wounds my Narcissism . . . . <P> It is not true that the War put a stop to The Fatherland , and it was resumed later as The American Monthly . Nothing ever put a stop to The Fatherland . It was published uninterruptedly . It is still published , though no longer by me . I changed the name before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential Americanism . <P> And why , in your list of my books , do you leave out the most important ones ? Glimpses of the Great , a record of my adventures as an interviewer , Spreading Germs of Hate , an impartial analysis of propaganda with a preface by Colonel House , and my chronicles of the Wandering Jew and the Wandering Jewess , written with Paul Eldridge . ... To list my books without including these is like printing a bibliography of Shakespeare without mentioning Hamlet ! <P> GEORGE SYLVESTER VIERECK New York City <P> New &; Good <P> Sirs : <P> I have just seen the excellent drawing of Hubert Lyautey on the cover of TIME for May 11 and should be much obliged if you would let me know who did it . <P> I am sorry to bother you but he seems to be a new man and a very good one and I should like to get in touch with him . <P> RAYMOND P. R. NEILSON , A. N. A. New York City Marcel Maurel , able young French artist and gallery-keeper of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cover . - ED . <P> April Fakery <P> Sirs : <P> Enclosed please find illustration from Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung , April 5 , 1931 . The two views of the Los Angeles are supposedly photographs by Sontrick . <P> Your publication gave no mention of this occurrence . Why ? <P> E. R. HABICHT <P> Charleston , W.
