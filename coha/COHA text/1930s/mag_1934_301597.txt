Top surgical salute in the U. S. is Boston Surgical Society 's Bigelow Medal , an honor for achievement in general surgery , which in 1926 went to New Orleans ' grand old Surgeon Rudolph Matas for the operative treatment of aneurisms ( TIME , Nov. 15 , 1926 ) . Last week Dr. Matas , 73 , found himself presenting a similar gold medal for similar accomplishment . <P> The medal bore his own plump-cheeked , spectacled features in relief . Present , too , were the four asterisks which Dr. Matas inserts at the end of every topic in his medical writings to indicate that the topical " cow has been milked dry . " Donor of the Matas Medal is Mike Sam Hart , big-boned , generous New Orleans Jew whose family grew rich in New Orleans public utilities . Mike Hart 's late sister , Violet Ida Hart , singer , was long a Matas patient . Her dying wish : " We must do something big for Dr. Matas , something that really will show our appreciation for him . " <P> The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a self-perpetuating board of four Tulane University surgeons for contributions to the surgery of blood vessels . <P> First recipient of the Matas Medal was Professor Mont Rogers Reid of the University of Cincinnati , who advanced the Matas technique in vascular surgery . <P> In surgery Dr. Matas has been protean . He was one of the first to use local anesthesia . He invented a splint for broken jaws and aluminum binders for bulging arteries . He discovered safe ways of operating in the cavities of the chest and sure ways of testing for blocked circulation in fingers and toes . <P> Probably the boldest procedure which Dr. Matas devised is the Matas Operation . Under some conditions an artery will blow up like a toy balloon . Its walls grow paper thin . This is an aneurism which any rough usage or surgery is apt to burst . Dr. Matas conceived the plan of opening the blood filled sacs , stitching the walls together like a seamstress taking in a pleat , and leaving the artery with a normal sized bore .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
