Pantywaist <P> Sirs : <P> I am unable to secure a satisfactory explanation of Communist term " pantywaist " ( TIME . Aug. 8 , p. 8 ) . Please define . <P> H. A. WASHINGTON <P> New York , N. Y. <P> A pantywaist is a kind of button-bestrewn under-jerkin worn by tots of both sexes . Little boys at an early age come to regard pantywaists as sissy . <P> - ED . <P> <P> Woe Is Us ! <P> Sirs : <P> Muncie Star says this trip of our President is costing the taxpayers a neat $150,000 and our Muncie Press states that it is costing another neat $500,000 to take the battleship thru the Panama Canal to meet the President and his party so they can fish . One of my mother 's friends receives the Congressional Record and it is shocking what goes on . She is away and I tried reaching her before writing this note , but I am sure that you can find some honest citizen that does take this Congressional Record and you can have facts . . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P.S. It will surprise you more to learn that the Government pays our President 's mother $150,000 per year so Hyde Park ( her home ) can be called and used as the Summer White House . You can check this also . It came from a friend of hers , an honest woman of high integrity . Woe is us ! <P> The Government pays Hyde Park 's owner ( Mrs. Sara Roosevelt ) not a cent for her hospitality to her son . Nor is it true , as popularly rumored , that Franklin Roosevelt 's recent fishing trip on the U.S.S. Houston cost taxpayers $150,000 . Expenses of his 37-day holiday were paid out of his travel account ( $25,000 a year ) , came to something between $500 and $1,000 for the entire trip . On his B. &; O. special train , President Roosevelt paid one first-class passage plus one and one-half fare for single occupancy of a drawing room . All the other passengers-and visitors-paid their own fares . The Houston burnt some fuel on her trip , but deteriorated less rapidly than if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of operating the Houston is $800,000 a year , so that its total cost for the time the President was aboard could have been no more than $60,000 . The sailors ' pay went on anyhow . The President paid for his share of the officers ' mess on the Houston-between $1.50 &; $1.75 a day ; his guests did likewise . - ED . <P> <P> Fire Walker <P> Sirs : <P> Hindu mystic Fire-Walker Kuda Bux TIME , Aug. 15 did n't do so well as John Hyde who , seeing Japanese priests perform this miracle , decided that he could do it too . He had noticed that the priests in their purifying ceremony before the walk rubbed their bare feet with salt . " So sure did I feel of the efficacy of the salt as a protective agent that on my second visit to the temple I determined to follow the priests in their apparently hazardous adventure , and so after rubbing my feet well in the pile of salt I walked rapidly over the bed of glowing coal , some 18 feet long . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a sensation of gentle warmth , but my ankles , to which no salt was applied , were scorched .
