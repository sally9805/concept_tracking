THINK of an ant crawling on the ground through a vast cornfield , looking up at the tall stalks . To the ant the cornstalks are as high as these California Big Trees are to a man gazing up at their distant tops . But it is their astounding age , as well as their size and beauty , which fills the soul of puny man with awe and reverence for the Creator . Big Trees , stout and healthy to-day , were centuries old when Christ was born . Men call them " the oldest living things . " So nearly indestructible are they that some naked , fire-scorched trunks still stand , though dead before America was discovered ; others , which fell centuries ago , remain sound and solid inside . Such vitality has the sequoia that when felled its branches do not wither for years . One giant crashed in 1926 when I was near . I saw it again , in 1931 ; its foliage was still fresh and green . They link us with the past . Their sequoia forbears grew here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enormous size . Such mammoths as the dinosaur , unable to adjust themselves to climatic and other changes , faded from the earth ; but the sequoia family endured and saw the rise of the mammals . Yet to-day , when you walk beneath these towering tree giants , you feel that the deer and the squirrel hardly fit into a scene set for the brontosaurus and the pterodactyl . SEQUOIAS GREW MILLIONS OF YEARS AGO Time was when the Sequoia genus was spread over four continents . At least twelve fossil species are known , scattered from Greenland and across Europe to Asia . Fossilized trunks as much as 10 feet in diameter and nearly 30 feet high still stand in Miocene deposits in Yellowstone National Park . The wood of these petrified trunks under the microscope looks very much like that of the trees alive to-day . These ancestors of our present sequoias formed much of forests which in ancient days clothed polar regions now barren or locked in ice . Only two species survived the Glacial Epoch , and these are now practically limited to California . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Big Trees . " Both are " big " and both are of the genus Sequoia ; both have pink or red wood and both are trees of the largest size . But they are two species , distinct in habitat , in bark , foliage , and in reproduction . The Coast Redwood , or Sequoia sempervirens , is found only near the coast or within the belt of sea fogs , and extends from southern Oregon down to Monterey County , in California . The larger species , the California Big Tree , or Sequoia gigantea , is confined to the western slopes of the Sierra Nevada , between 4,000 and 8,500 feet elevation , from Placer County , in the north , to Tulare County , in the south , end is much more abundant in the south than in the north . The Coast Redwood forms an almost continuous forest in which it is the dominant stand ; the Big Trees grow in scattered groves , 71 in all , interspersed among the heavier stands of white fir , sugar pine , and other trees . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taller than its cousin , the Big Tree . The former attains a maximum height of 363 feet and a maximum base diameter of about 25 feet ; the latter has a maximum height of about 300 feet and a base diameter of about 35 feet . When the Coast Redwood is cut down , it " stump-sprouts , " as foresters say . A ring of young trees springs up around the stump of the slaughtered sempervirens ; hence its Latin name , the " Ever-living Sequoia . " But the Big Tree reproduces only from seed ; and , since its seeds require specially favorable conditions to root , there was real danger of the extinction of the species until national and State parks were created . The bark of the Coast Redwood is brown and gray ; that of a mature Big Tree has warm hues , from maroon to several shades of red , which at sunset often shine with strange brilliancy . Big Tree forests are open , sunny , and full of color . The Coast Redwood forests are by contrast damp and somber . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fir or hemlock , but the slender , prickly foliage of the Big  | Tree has no counterpart in America . The only tree which at first glance might be confused with the Big Tree is the cryptomeria of Japan . ICE AND FIRE WERE FIRST FOES OF THE BIG TREES Ages before man came to chop these trees for his use , ice and fire were their fierce foes . Again and again moving glaciers mowed them down ? glaciers whose icy fingers stretched down mountain canyons to freeze all animal and plant life . Whether in warm and sheltered spots a few trees remained , or whether only seeds survived , can probably never be known ; but slowly the cold hands relaxed and the forests returned . The fact that the Big Trees are more abundant and larger in the southern part of their range indicates that there the effects of the glaciers were less severe . With the passing of the Age of Ice , the struggles of the sequoias had only begun . Fires followed the ordeal of ice . The abundant rains ceased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ready to be ignited by lightning or by brands tossed by Indians to drive out game or clear land for forage . There is scarcely a mature sequoia that does not show the effects of at least one fire . Every 20 or 30 years flames swept through  | the forest , sometimes licking hungrily , but with little effect , at the thick , asbestoslike bark ; again , where a litter of boughs and fallen logs was piled up against a Big Tree , the fire burned fiercely enough to penetrate the outer cover and into the heart . That is why the great black caverns in the living sequoias are almost always found on the upper side of those standing on a slope . THE SEQUOIAS HEAL THEIR OWN WOUNDS Careful inspection of a Big Tree , even one with an unbroken front of new bark , usually shows traces of many fires . Often an arrow-shaped scar runs from the base a hundred feet or more toward the crown . Such blemishes , covered by new bark , were caused by fires long before the discovery of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the rate of half an inch or less a year , until finally the wound was healed . Tree torches burning in the Sierra Nevada might have signalized every event in recorded human history , from the building of the Pyramids to our own Civil War . The length of time that the black , charred wood , soft as it is , has adhered is equally astonishing . With your thumb nail you can chip off pieces of charcoal formed by fires that burned hundreds of years ago .  | No doubt the Coast Redwoods were seen by the first Europeans to visit our Pacific coast . Yet for more than two centuries after the visit of Sir Francis Drake , in 1579 , white men roamed up and down California apparently without climbing far enough up the high Sierras to find the Big Trees . The Indians knew them , of course . In summer they camped among them and left potholes in granite rocks where they ground acorn meal . Even now the identity of the first white men to gaze on the Big Trees of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the Joseph R. Walker Expedition of 1833 . One Zenas Leonard , clerk of the Walker party , recorded : " In the last two days ' traveling we have found some trees of the Redwood species incredibly large , some of which would measure from 16 to 18 fathoms ( 96 to 108 feet ) around the trunk at the height of a large man 's head from the ground . " That group of Big Trees , now known as the Calaveras North Grove , was , however . the first of these sequoias to become well known . In the spring of 1852 A. T. Dowd , a miner of Murphy 's Camp , in the historic Mother Lode district , followed a wounded bear into the sequoias . He came running  | back to his companions and excitedly dragged them with him to see the largest bear in California . " What he showed them was a Big Tree ? probably the one which afterward was felled and a dance hall built on top of it . John Bidwell , a member of the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated that he saw the Calaveras Big Trees in 1841 ; but Dowd is popularly given credit as the discoverer of the Sequoia gigantea . It was the Calaveras Grove which inspired Bret Harte to write his poem , " On a Cone of the Big Trees . " DISCOVERY OF THE GIANT FOREST In 1857 Galen Clark discovered the Mariposa , or Wawona , Grove in what is now the Yosemite National Park . The following year Hale D. Tharp , a pioneer of Three Rivers , in Tulare County , was led up the Middle Fork of the Kaweah River by Yokut Indians , and on up the grassy slopes beneath Moro Rock to the plateau where grows the noblest forest of the Sequoia gigantea , the Giant Forest , in what is now Sequoia National Park . THE " GENERAL SHERMAN " MAY BE THE WORLD 'S LARGEST TREE Few explorers have left as permanent a record of their discoveries as that made by old Hale Tharp . On a fallen , hollow sequoia log the bold and well-formed characters , " H. D. Tharp , 1858 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . A glassed frame now protects them from vandalism . Here , in Sequoia National Park , stands that hoary veteran of all Big Trees , the " General Sherman , " found and named by James Wolverton in 1879 . Many other trees , including Redwoods , Douglas firs , and the Australian eucalyptus , are taller ;  | but no other , so far as I know , has its bulk . Its greatest base diameter is 36.5 feet and its trunk contains 600,120 board feet of lumber . You can imagine its size when told that a train of 30 railway cars would be required to haul its trunk alone . One limb , 130 feet above the ground , is nearly seven feet thick . Sawed into boards , the tree would build about forty 5-room houses ! In New Zealand , kauri pines attain a diameter of 20 feet , and in Tule , Oaxaca , Mexico , a giant cypress , said to be 6,500 years old , measures 58 feet in diameter and 255 feet in height . The reputed age of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diameter may include a number of stump sprouts around a dead tree , which have coalesced into a solid bole . So far as is reliably known , the California Big Trees are the oldest and largest living things in the world : but there is an opportunity for some explorer and lover of trees to investigate the arboreal monarchs of the world , to see whether there are any legitimate disputants of " General Sherman 's " title to the " oldest and largest living thing . " When a tree is older than the Christian era , there is no need for exaggeration . Yet there has been much confusion about the ages of the Big Trees and the Coast Redwoods . Guesses of 5,000 years and more have been made . The only way to determine the age of a tree is by counting the rings of annual growth . To get this count , one must either saw down a tree or take core borings . The oldest Big Tree found by Huntington was 3,150 years old , and he found only three over 3,000 years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he counted the rings of one tree in the Converse Basin that showed an age of more than 4,000 years ; but diligent search has failed to rediscover that tree . Dr. A. E. Douglass , of the University of Arizona , a leading authority on the relation between weather cycles and tree rings , took a boring of " General Sherman " in August , 1931 . Results of his experiment indicate that the tree is between 3,500 and 4,000 years old . Until white men came with ax , saw , and dynamite , the Big Trees ' only enemies were ice and fire . Yet in a few short years of logging perhaps as many Big Trees as now remain in the Giant Forest were destroyed . In one area alone , the Converse Basin , mammoth sequoias by the score were felled and scarcely used . With the passing of their shade , moist , flowery meadows were also turned into dreary sand flats . Here stands what is called the " Chicago Stump , " all that is left of a Big Tree felled in 1891 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the Worlds Fair . That tree was reported to have been 300 feet high and 26 feet in diameter where cut . A later estimate shows it may have been larger , even larger than the Sherman tree . Two men , using an extra-long saw made by brazing two 12-foot saws together , worked thirteen days to cut down the Chicago tree ! SAVING THESE GLORIOUS TREES FOR MAN 'S FUTURE ENJOYMENT To save some of these trees , the Sequoia National Park was created in 1890 , and for years patrolled each summer by United States cavalry . Private individuals , however , still owned the finest parts of the sequoia forests and had , of course , a perfect right to cut them down for lumber . To avoid this , the late Stephen T. Mather , as Director of the National Park Service , asked Congress for funds with which to buy and save more of the Big Trees . An appropriation was made , but it was insufficient . Then aid was asked of the National Geographic Society . Immediately , from its own funds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sufficient to purchase the lands and Big Trees desired ( see illustration , page 225 ) . In all , The Society bought and gave to the United States a total of 1,916 acres at a cost of $96,330. * In early days of the park , when cavalry rode its trails , visitors were few ? not more than 3,000 to 4,000 people a year . Now , with motor roads , hotels , and comfortable Government-owned camp grounds , this season may bring 150,000 visitors . Stand at the park entrance long enough  | and you may see motorcars from every State in the Union and Canada . Thousands flee the desert and lowlands heat for the cool , pine-scented forest shadows 7,000 feet and more above sea level . Some are most amused by park bears fussing over the camp garbage ( see page 227 ) . Some fish or hike , or want to climb near-by Mount Whitney , 14,496 feet high . " How high is this tree ? " some ask ; or . " How old is that one ? " Others , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " When do we get to the Big Trees ? " Some read , some sleep , ignoring it all . Some walk off alone , to sit silently a long time , gazing up at the giants . Although summer visitors are most numerous , increasing numbers now come in winter for the snow sports . California newspapers are quick to report the first falls of snow heavy enough for coasting. , and any week-end after snow has fallen girls and boys in bright - colored Alpine costumes , with sleds , skis , and toboggans lashed on their motorcars , come swarming up to the park from Los Angeles and other near-by cities . Park officials and lodge-keepers take especial pains for the comfort and safety of these " snow birds " ( see page 218 ) . Winter or summer , all visitors are the guests of Uncle Sam ; for them , for posterity he saved the Big Trees .  |
