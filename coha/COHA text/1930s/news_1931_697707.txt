txt Miss Ella V. von E. Wendel , the last of her Iine , died Friday evening at 6:30 o'clock in the old brick house at the northwest corner of Fifth Avenue at Thirty-ninth Street , where she had lived since 1856 , like her five sisters who died there before her , devoted only to keeping the accumulated land holdings of three generations in the name of Wendel . Now there are no more Wendels , and no next of kin , for John Gottlieb Wendel , the only male of the third generation , spent his life keeping his six sisters from marriages that might have dispersed the property and endangered the duty laid by the first John Wendel on his only son John D. , and his descendants when he left the fur business with the first John Jacob Astor . " Buy , but never sell New York real estate , " was John Wendel 's last command . The real estate accumulated in the name of Wendel is now valued at more than $100,000,000 and the only living creature that was close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Although it has been generally understood that Rebecca , the sister who died last July , arranged to have the estate go to charities , churches and public institutions , it was explainedl yesterday by Charles G. Koss and George F. Warren , attorneys for the Wendels , that the disposition of the bulk of the estate depended entirely upon Ella 's will . They declined to give any indication as to its contents , however , and were unable to say when It would be filed for probate . Publicity Always Shunned . In accordance with the principle which John Gottlieb Wendel had impressed upon his sisters before he died sixteen years ago  --  that publicity was as demeaning as luxury ? there was no crepe on the door . The lawyers simply announced yesterday that Miss Ella Wendel had " died during the night at the age of 78 . " They arranged to have her buried today among the Wendels who preceded her , in Trinity Churchyard at 155th Street and Amsterdam Avenue , after a private funeral service at the house . The house itself has been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by one the rooms which they occupied were closed and shuttered after each death , until the house began to excite the curiosity of tourists . Guides began to point It out as " a house of mystery . " The remaining Wendels , however , paid no attention and they changed nothing . There was no elevator , no dumb-waiter ; the house t is still lighted only by gas . A telephone was put in last Wednesday , but only because of Miss Wendel 's illness . As their real estate holdings spread , the frugal lives of the Wendels apparently contracted . When Ella died , she had been using only her bedroom and the dining room , wandering only occasionally into a big front room on the top floor , where she and her five sisters had once learned the reading , writing and arithmetic which their father thought was the sufficient education of a young woman at the time of the Civil War . Stood at Window Last Monday . Ella 's last look at the outside world was taken from the window of this school @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memories of her childhood ? tall , lean , in a rusty black dress with , a white collar ? rubbing at the dust on the window and staring across Fifth Avenue at the building which the Union League Club recently vacated . It was the only thing in the vicinity that was nearly as old as the Wendels . And now it had gone like the rest . The club moved there when Ella was 28 years old and when the six Wendel sisters still felt young enough to discuss ways and means of escaping their brother 's restraint and seeing something of the animated life of New York in 1880 . Rebecca , who died last year , was the only one of the six to escape , eventually , and she did not make up her mind to oppose her brother until late ? in life ; then , despite his violent opposition , she married Professor Luther A. Swope , a friend of the vicar of Trinity and also the son of an old New York family . Thereafter John Wendel discouraged his sisters from going to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when Georgiana , at the age of 50 , ran away from Irvington-onthe-Hudson , the country home where the sisters went with their brother every Summer . She appeared alone at the Park Avenue Hotel . Her brother had her committed to the psychopathic ward in Be/levue and then had her pronounced insane by a Sheriff 's jury . She was later released from a sanatorium when the Supreme Court declared her commitment unconstitutional . She sued her brother for $50,000 but the suit was conciliated out of court and she went back to live with John and her sisters among the relics of a youth they never were permitted to enjoy . Brother Held Realty Titles . Two of the sisters , Josephine and Augusta , died before John , whose death occurred in 1915 . The administration of his estate revealed that , with the consent of his four surviving sisters , he had carried the titles of all the Wendel property , then valued at about $80,000,00 , in his own name . Mary , Georgiana and Ella turned for leadership to their married sister , THE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " they said , " when she had a paralytic stroke from which she died after a week . " The stroke occurred after she had taken her last look out of the window at the deserted Union League Club across the street and at the crowds streaming up and down the avenue in sunshine and freedom . Her lawyers denied indignantly the story that she had recently accepted the invitation printed by Texas Guinan in her column to visit a night club , and all the details as to her enjoyment of the spectacle . Never Owned Jewelry . After half a century of the stern German discipline of John Gottlieb Wendel , no sister of his could visit a night club . They even shrank from confronting the daytime hustle of life by ever leaving the house , and refused to let it in , by phonograph , telephone , . radio or even by ventilation . None of the Wendel sisters ever owned any jewelry or had other than high-necked black dresses , which they wore until they became shabby . They never entertained . Two years ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to drive John Gottlieb Wendel on his real estate errands around the city , the Wendel carriage was dismantled . The two old Wendel automobiles in the stable on the Thirty-ninth Street side of the house have been on blocks all Winter , waiting for their semi-annual use by Miss Ella , in Spring to take her to the Wendel country home at Irvington , and in Autumn to bring her back . There was very little exchange of affection between the sisters who lived In the same house . They simply spent their lives side by side and transmitted their possessions without any terms of endearment , in a precise list of real estate parcels . Ella , the last , was the only one who displayed any kindliness , and that was always reserved for a French poodle named Tobey . It was not always the same poodle , but , as one Tobey died after another , his post was always refilled . Behind the Wendel house at Irvington there is a small cemetery full of past Tobeys . It was in their name that John Gottlieb Wendel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Thirty-ninth Street shortly before he died , when Lord &; Taylor were making their plans to move uptown . " My sister must have a place for her dog Tobey , " he said ; and by those who did not know him this was regarded as a piece of consideration for Ella 's feelings . His own explanation , however , was that he was tired of saying simply that he would not sell and was pressed to give a reason ; and that was the only one he could think of . Present Tobey There 3 Years . The present Tobey has occupied his position of pet for about three years . He sleeps in a special little bed in Ella 's bedroom and stands to eat at a specially built table in the great gloomy dining room , where his mistress had her meals at a table covered with red velvet . Tobey is the only lively creature on a parcel of real estate which was last assessed at $6,000 for the house and $3,684,000 for the land , which he enjoys as his private runway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Tobey is , but they were brought to the Wendels by the servants who grew too old for housework , and they have apparently sunk into the mood of the house . They seem despondent and speak as if speech were a forgotten exercise in which they had grown clumsy . It was not until after Ella 's stroke last Monday that the first invasion of modern apparatus was permitted . Last Wednesday a telephone was installed ; but ' only so that the two trained nurses in attendance might summon the doctor in a crisis . There was no next of kin to summon . When Ella Wendel died only the nurses , the doctor , whose name was withheld , and the daughter of one of the lawyers , Miss Isabelle G. Koss , were at her bedside . Those who may be expected to attend the funeral tomorrow are only the lawyers and the servants and three or four distant relatives of Rebecca 's dead husband . Opposed to Improvements . The policy of making no improvements , which has kept the Wendel home equipped with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ applied to all their holdings . The Wendels were interested primarily in the land , not in the buildings on it , because the land would be good to hold forever . If tenants wanted any improvements they must make them at their own expense . Certain improvements , however , were always forbidden by the Wendel sisters . They all agreed there must be no saloons or theatres on their land and the erection of an electric sign on any of their properties was prohibited . They once held up the lease of a building in the midtown garment section where the rental was $1,000,000 a year until they first obtained guarantees that the firstaid kits to be installed in the clothing manufactories of the new building would not contain more than a pint of whisky . Pending the filing of Ella Wendel 's will , the disposition of a minor part of the Wendel estate has already been determined by a trust which Rebacca 's will created last year , giving Ella life interest in certain parcels of real estate , which were to be divided at her death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the major share . These five are the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal Church for use In the Theological Seminary at Nanking , Chita ; the New York Society for the Relief of the Ruptured and Crippled ; St. Christopher 's Home for Children at Dobbs Ferry ; the New York Homeopathic Medical College and Flower Hospital , for the exclusive use of the Flower Hospital ; and the Drew Theological Seminary , Madison , N. J. WENDELS NEVER SOLD LAND . Purchase ! of Sisters Now Valued at ' More Than $100,000,000 . The vast holdings of real estate accumulated by the Wendel sisters because of the commandment : " Buy , but never sell , " laid down by John Wendel , fur tracer founder of the Wendel fortune , range from a Broadway block to lower East Side tenements and more open properties in Westchester County and Long Island . Estimated conservatively , the value is at least $100,000,000 , in the opinion of real estate men .

Her husband died in 1924 , leaving $90,000 , which became part of the Wendel holdings . In 1925 Mary died . In 1929 Georgiana died . Rebecca 's death last year left Ella alone with more than $100,000,000 worth of real estate holdings , which had spread from Manhattan throughout the city . Ella , who had always done " the household duties " in the old house , left the management of the property during the past year to the lawyers who had acted , as their fathers had acted , as attorneys for the succeeding generations of Wendels . She continued about " her household duties , " as the lawyers expressed it yesterday , when they were asked how she died . She was " going about her household duties as
