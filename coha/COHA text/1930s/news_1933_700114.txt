txt George ( Machine-Gun ) Kelly , wanted for murder in three large cities , was captured here this morning without a shot being fired . He will be taken to Oklahoma City in a few days to stand trial for alleged participation in the kidnapping of Charles P. Urschel , wealthy oil man . Kelly had a pistol in his hand when arrested but his captor , Detective Sergeant William Raney of the Memphis force , held a shotgun against him and Kelly did n't hesitate at the command : " Drop that gun ! " He dropped it meekly . The capture ended a search that has been under way for weeks . It is not finished , for Kelly 's companions in crime , Verne Miller , Wilbur Underhill , Richard Gallatas and Bob Brady , are still at large . Kelly 's wife , Kathryn , was seized with him , as were J. R. Tichenor , in whose home he sought refuge , and S. M. Travis , who was also in the Tichenor home . Federal agents had been scour-. ing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never far behind them . Besides being accused of collecting the $200,000 ransom that was paid for the release of Mr. Urschel , Kelly was wanted in connection with the massacre of four policemen and a prisoner at the Kansas City railroad station , the robbery of a Federal Reserve Bank messenger and the killing of a policeman in St. Paul and the robbery of Federal Reserve Bank mail and the killing of Policeman Miles Cunningham in Chicago last Friday . Agents Long on Trail . The government took up Kelly 's trail after the Urschel kidnapping . It was revealed that Mr. Urschel had been held captive on the Texas farm owned by Mrs. Kelly 's mother and step-father , Mr. and Mrs. R. G. Shannon , who are now on trial in Oklahoma City along with the notorious bandit , Harvey Bailey , and others . Police say there is no question of Kelly 's participation in that kidnapping . The Shannons have made admissions to that effect , and Mrs. Kelly had communicated with District Attorney Herbert H. Hyde of Oklahoma City in an effort to aid . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kelly and $5,000 for the arrest of Mrs. Kelly had been offered . Today it appeared that credit for the arrests was divided among the following : Geraldine Arnold , 12 years old , who furnished the information that Kelly could be found in Memphis . Federal Agent William A. Roper , who was ordered to fly from Birmingham to Memphis and did so , locating the home where Kelly was found . Sergeant Raney , who made the actual capture . As Federal agents are not allowed to participate in rewards , it is uncertain how the $15,000 will be split . Memphis police who assisted in the storming of the Tichenor home may come in for a share . Fight Had Been Expected . Police and Federal operatives felt relieved today that Kelly had been captured without the loss of a life . It had been expected that he would resist unto the last bullet . The gunman was surly when taken to jail . " I 'll be out of this in no time , " he snarled when put in a cell . " Let 's see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his confederate , Bailey , in breaking out of prisons inspired police with the belief that Kelly was not making an idle boast . Kelly and his gang of Southwestern desperadoes are regarded as the most dangerous ever encountered , and no less than fifty police men will be guarding him as long as he stays in Memphis . As many , or perhaps more , will ? be detailed to accompany him on the journey to Oklahoma City . Mrs. Kelly said she would waive extradition and go as soon as the officials were ready to take her . She is hopeful that her testimony will help her parents , whose defense to date is that they were coerced into acting as guards over Mr. Urschel . Her brother , Armon is also on trial and testimony has been given that he received a part of the ransom money . Mrs. Kelly said she had intended going to Oklahoma City voluntarily to surrender and testify . Her husband threatened to kill her if she tried to leave him , she added , but now that both were under arrest she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arrest . " I 'm glad we are both arrested , because I am not guilty and I can prove it , " she told Chief of Police Will D. Lee . " I 'll be rid of him and that bunch . I do n't want to say anything about that guy Kelly , but he got me into this terrible mess and I do n't want to have anything more to do with him . " The story of the capture is somewhat as follows : About fifteen days ago the Kellys picked up three hitch-hikers in their automobile . They were the Arnold child and her mother and father . The Kellys decided it would detract suspicion from them if they kept the little girl with them , so they made an arrangement with the Arnolds . After Luther Arnold , the father , consented to leaving his daughter with them , he was asked to aid in making a contact with a lawyer in Oklahoma to defend the family of Mrs. Kelly in the kidnap trial . He recommended John Roberts of Enid , and received money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to District Attorney Hyde and talked about the possible surrender of Mrs. Kelly , and sought to have the Shannons released on bail . Mr. Hyde refused . Mr. Hyde learned of the part Arnold had in the transaction and had him watched . Federal agents shadowed the man on a. trip to San Antonio , where he made a new contact with the Kellys . When he returned to Oklahoma he was arrested on a Mann Act charge , growing out of having two girls with him on the trip . Arnold agreed to help the government . Child Gives Tip . Arnold learned Monday night that his daughter was being sent home by the Kellys , who were fearful of arrest , he told government agents , who met the little girl at the train . She told them that Kelly was in Memphis , but did not know the exact address . A message was sent to Agent Roper . When he landed in Memphis near midnight he telephoned his chief J. Edgar Hoover , in Washington , and was told to get all available help and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found . The house was surrounded and Sergeant Raney knocked at the door . Kelly opened it and stuck out his .45-calibre automatic pistol . Raney , who is a powerful man afraid of nothing , pushed his shotgun against Kellys stomach . It was a tense second , but Raney 's coolness won . The rest was easy . The man who might be hanged or electrocuted in any of three States was in the hands of the government , which in recent months has been waging a war to the death against kidnappers for ransom , acting on orders of the President himself . Next comes Kelly 's trial in connection with the Urschel kidnapping . Both Kelly and his wife pleaded not guilty tonight to charges of being involved in the kidnapping . They were arraigned before Lester H. Brenner , United States Commissioner . Bonds of each were fixed at $100 , - 000.
