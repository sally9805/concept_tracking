txt Apparent rapid advance toward identification of the three girls found dead on a mountainside near here Saturday came today with mounting evidence linking them to the tragedy near Altoona in which a matt and a woman were shot dead . The new evidence pointed to a possibility that the girls and the couple in the double slaying were from California . This might suggest a reason for the long delay in the identification of the victims of both tragedies . A bus driver today identified the woman slain near Altoona , about 100 miles from here , as the companion of three children in a trip on his bus from New York to Harrisburg . Previously the bus driver had visited the morgue here and had tentatively identified the three girls as his passengers of the trip . He declared he was certain in the case of the youngest girl , saying she sat on his lap for a time and he heard her called " Jenny " by the woman accompanying them . Tells of Rip in Coat . Of the other girls , White was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " a very close resemblance . " However , he described to the police how the oldest girl had had a rip in the shoulder of the green coat she wore . This , the police regarded as a significant clue , for the coat worn by the oldest of the dead girls was green and one sleeve was torn loose at the shoulder . The children , who appear to be sisters , were about 16 , 10 and 8 years of age . The woman and a man were found shot to death Saturday in the tiny Spring Meadow Station of the Pennsylvania Railroad near Altoona .

A couple and three children were also placed by several persons as guests at a restaurant in Philadelphia for several meals . The family gave indication that it was very poor and one of the little girls told another guest at the restaurant that they were from California . An advertising blotter was given by the proprietor of the restaurant to the family . A blotter of this type was found in the possession of the man in the double slaying . The first definite indication that violence attended the deaths was discovered late tonight when the brains of the three children were subjected to microscopic examination by three physicians at Harrisburg . They found that the oldest girl had received a blow on the forehead which , although it hardly left a mark on the skin , had caused a congested area about the size of a fifty-cent piece underneath .

Messages came by telegraph , teletype and mail . There were hundreds of them , and they came from nearly thirty States . Boston Driver Gives Clue . One message seemed to corroborate the story of White . He had told the police that the woman and three children had tickets from Boston . Today a telephone message from the police in Boston said that a bus driver there had seen pictures of the dead children in a Boston paper and was sure that the children were the same three who , with a woman , had ridden on his bus Tuesday from Boston tit New York .

" The children , " he said , " all seemed happy and seemed to be looking forward to something at the end of their trip . " He did not see the children board the Pittsburgh bus at Harrisburg , he said , but a steward named Price at the bus depot declared he saw them board it .

The State police sent out an appeal by teletype today that school authorities in Pennsylvania . New Jersey , New York , Massachusetts , Connecticut , Ohio , Maryland and Delaware make a sharp check on absentees and report whether in any school three girls answering the description of the dead girls were missing .

" All the evidence , he says , indicated that they died a peaceful death , while the manner in which they were laid out showed consideration bordering on tenderness . " We get dozens of families through here , traveling by automobile , " the chief explains , " who are without a place to live and food to eat . They go from town to town , the Salvation Army or some other charitable agency feeds them , and somehow they manage to get a supply of gasoline . " I believe that when this case breaks it will do so through the finding of the bodies of a man and woman , and perhaps through the finding of an automobile somewhere in this section of the country . And I believe that when the facts become known , or if they do , it will be found that the children were killed because their parents lacked the wherewithal to feed them and wanted to save them from slow death by starvation . " Death Cause Still Mystery . Thus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dr. George W. Moffitt , pathologist , of the Harrisburg Hospital , who is examining the vital organs , said tonight that a spectroscopic examination had failed to reveal the presence of carbon monoxide . " This , " he explained , " does not prove that carbon monoxide was not the cause , but I shall have to continue my examinations before I am able to determine just what did cause the deaths . " At the same time Dr. Moffitt disclosed that he had been able to establish positively that none of the girls was attacked and that there was no evidence of corrosive poison having been administered to them . Plans were being made today to bury the children Friday . Lieutenant A. J. Hudock from the State Police School at Hershey began making death masks of the three this afternoon .
