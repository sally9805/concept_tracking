MONDAY NIGHT - Kay Boyle - Ear-court , Brace ( $2.50 ) . <P> One of the few U. S. expatriate writers left in Europe is Kay Boyle , 35 , Minnesota-born . Her short stories and novels still suffer from the elliptical writing that flourished in post-War Paris . They are difficult reading not because her prose is obscure , but because her characters are puzzling neurotics and she does not seem to know it . <P> Like her five previous novels , Monday Night is at its best in creating momentary moods of neurotic tension , in flashes of brilliant writing . Its central character is a comic grotesque called Wilt , a washed-out , oldtime , expatriate newspaperman , middleaged , garrulous , full of stories he never got around to writing . In a promising beginning , Wilt is introduced on a Paris street corner in mysterious talk with a big , nave pal named Bernie , a medical student just arrived from the Midwest in hopes of meeting his hero , a famed French toxicologist . Wilt , who had met Bernie only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> The search for the toxicologist begins in a bar , where they start drinking on empty stomachs , continues via other bars , where they pick up strange stories of the toxicologist 's victims . They get involved with drunks , with the toxicologist 's servants , with the wife and child of a man sentenced to life imprisonment on the toxicologist 's evidence . Meantime , Wilt reels off his unwritten stories , long since ignoring poor Bernie , who whimpers because Wilt wo n't stop to eat , because he has been seduced and because he has lost his money . Unfortunately , the comic side of this Walpurgis Night wandering diminishes when Author Boyle endows Wilt with an intuition , inspired by drink and his own fantasies , that enables him to solve in one night a fraud which takes seven years for the law courts to see through . Modest readers , unable to figure out Kay Boyle 's queer people , may be left with an uneasy sense of their own confusion ; more confident readers will call the author addled .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
