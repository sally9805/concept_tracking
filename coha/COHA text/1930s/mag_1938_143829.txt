When a big three-motored T. W. A. Fokker crashed in 1931 , killing among others Knute Kenneth Rockne , that type of plane was grounded . Last week the Bureau of Air Commerce ( day after it was done by the company itself ) grounded Northwest Airlines ' eight new Lockheed 14 H transports , fastest in the world . One had crashed with ten people in Montana fortnight ago ( TIME , Jan. 17 ) . From the 1931 order the Fokker plant never recovered ; Fokker airplanes disappeared from the U. S. sky .
