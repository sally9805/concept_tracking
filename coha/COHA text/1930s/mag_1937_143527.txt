Edna His Wife ( adapted by Cornelia Otis Skinner from the novel by Margaret Ayer Barnes ; produced and acted by Miss Skinner ) . Given 30 seconds to change her costume , makeup and wig , Cornelia Otis Skinner can be all things to all men . In the past she has specialized in monologues and short solo-dramas ( The Wives of Henry VIII ; The Loves of Charles II ) . Now she appears in her first full-length play . As usual , she is singlehanded . <P> The heroine of Author Barnes 's bestseller , which Miss Skinner tailored to fit herselves , is a girl who marries the wrong man . In 1900 Edna was a small-town blonde , a frontporch girl . In 1937 she is white-haired and miserable in the luxury of a New York penthouse . Reason : she jilted the simple-hearted brakeman who loved her for an ambitious young lawyer who loved success . <P> The characters in this bromidic fable are superficial , the emotional appeal obvious . There are coy references to the hectic speed of the bicycle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ atones for these commonplaces by the varied distinction of her acting . Not only does she play Edna at crucial stages of her life , she impersonates seven other characters besides . Broadly caricatured and really funny is her dowager Dolly McElroy , millionaire wife of a Chicago meat packer , who welcomes Edna 's husband into pre-War society among potted palms and ottomans . As Edna 's sister on the deck of the doomed excursion boat , Eastland , Miss Skinner is at her best . Although the only stage effect is a swaying rail for her to clutch , she projects the full horror of the sinking ship . Later , as a sculptress who is Edna 's husband 's mistress , she contributes a sympathetic , plausible portrait that helps to save the story from bathos . <P> In spite of , or because of the fact that Miss Skinner is the hardest-worked actress now playing on Broadway , her entertainment has a large element of stunt-appeal . Theatregoers tell each other how wonderful it is that she can do it all alone . Edna His Wife is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoken lines can the audience know what the invisible characters are supposed to be saying . Thanks to Miss Skinner 's powers of suggestion , Edna 's husband , who never appears , seems as real as any person in the play .
