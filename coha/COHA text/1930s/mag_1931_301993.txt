THEY WERE STILL DANCING-Evelyn Waugh-Cape &; Smith ( $2.50 ) . <P> When precociously successful Author Evelyn Waugh ( pronounced Waw ) set England snickering with his Decline and Fall and Vile Bodies , his remarks began to be of interest to literary gossips . When he said he hoped some day to write the perfect travel book , knew just how it should be written ; when last year he went to Abyssinia for Ras Tafari 's coronation ( TIME , Nov. 3 , 1930 ) , Waugh-minded readers looked forward to a treat . Here it is-perhaps not the perfect travel book , but sufficiently Waughmsical , refreshingly out of the ordinary . <P> Says Author Waugh , the only historical parallel to life in Addis Ababa ( Ras Tafari 's made-to-order Abyssinian capital ) is Alice in Wonderland . " It is in Alice only that one finds the peculiar flavor of galvanized and translated reality , where animals carry watches in their waistcoat pockets , Royalty paces the croquet lawn beside the chief executioner , and litigation ends in a flutter of playing cards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to Zanzibar . Kenya Colony , the Congo , Cape Town and so home to England . If the descriptions of the people he encountered are often a little too funny to be true , you do not mind : the U. S. professor faking stomach-trouble to get out of an embarrassing situation ; the " delightfully amiable young Greek , " unwilling gigolo , with his polite apology : " You wo n't allow me , wo n't you ? " Traveler Waugh does not actually make you pine to follow his path but he does give you a good vicarious trip : most of it interesting , some of it entertaining , now &; then screamingly funny . <P> Author Evelyn Waugh looks more like a precociously bad little boy than a thriving 28-year-old author . At Oxford he moved quietly among the esthetes ; safe now in the same smart world that shelters his elder brother Alec , he knows all the Bright Young People , lately set more than one of their tables on a squeal by turning Roman Catholic .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
