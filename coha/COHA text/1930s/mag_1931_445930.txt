To fly three thousand hours and live , only to find thirty minutes an eternity in which every second seemed the last ; to contend and struggle for years with growing success in the roar of Wall Street , then to be caught on a lonely , silent prairie , unable to get back , to do anything , to avert anything , and to learn that one was going broke hour by hour ? such were the contrasts of experience through which I have lived . As a wide-eyed youth , I tremblingly went aloft with the pioneers , and I 've been flying , on and off , ever since . As a grown man , I became absorbed in that curious life endured by those who live and die by the sword ? that is , the stock market . In other words , I became an investment banker . I nearly always worked ; I often flew . The two went well together , strangely enough , for flying has not , as yet , anything to do with making money . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never leaves anyone ; and the fascination of making money is denied only by those who have never done it . Things were high , wide , and handsome , when , most suddenly , the result of my work went smash , and the apparently solid things lay in bits ; but right at that moment my faithful pastime staged a counter-climax , and kicked me up against forces far greater than anything the Street could muster . It worked . I got back , or for the first time acquired , a perspective ; and for once I knew what was real and what was n't . It started after the first big market crash . The pennies , a little lonely after repeated decimations , were still a respectable band . That was all right . But the universal , insistent , unnecessary gloom became altogether too much to be borne . A friend of mine , a real banker , had a client rush in on him and exclaim : ' Mr. P --  , this situation is terrible ! I feel as if I were caught in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circle . For God 's sake get me out , and to hell with the cheese ! ' This gentleman expressed my sentiments perfectly , but I could not get out . I did the next best thing : I departed for the Middle West and joined a friend who owned a powerful aeroplane , and we concocted a trip into the Northwest , half business , half pastime . He was not a pilot , but he employed a very good one . The machine was rather exceptional ; it is still , I think , the finest aeroplane that can be had . A cabin monoplane , quite small , streamlined to within an inch of its life , hung behind a huge engine of four hundred and some horsepower , itself a magnificent piece of mechanism . At full throttle the machine had an air speed of about a hundred and seventy-five miles an hour ; we usually cruised at about one hundred and fifty to sixty . The landing speed was high , and thereby hung tales . The body was cigar-shaped and smooth , even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Inside , the pilot sat right up in front , behind the engine , with a bulkhead behind him . Farther back were two comfortable leather seats , and directly before them two tip-up seats , which we never used . Our bags went in behind us . The big wing was attached to the top of the body , and we looked out sideways through glass windows , under the wing . The pilot , of course , had windows looking straight ahead . The gasoline tanks were inside the wing , and gave us about five hours ' supply , or enough for around eight hundred miles . Few Army or Navy pursuit aeroplanes , even single-seaters , were as fast or could carry as much gasoline , and if a man wanted speed ? why , here it was . The weather was poor , and a day or two passed before we cared to start on such a long trip . It was gray and raining when we finally stood on the tarmac watching the pilot warm up the engine . The ceiling was about five @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We went to the main office at the Kansas City airport and found out about the weather on our route . Our first stop was to be Minneapolis . We found that the weather at Des Moines was much clearer , and looking better to the north . On a long flight one is pretty sure to run into bad weather somewhere , and frequently it is a good sign to start in a poor weather area , with the consequent likelihood of running out of it . Still , it looked rather poor for high-speed flying . We went back to the machine . It glistened ; every part was smooth and shining , and even the wheels were three-quarters enclosed in a metal streamlining , to cut down resistance . The pilot had the engine nearly wide open , the aeroplane quivered , the roar was deafening . Then the pilot cut the throttle until the propeller just barely flicked around , and climbed out . She 's hot , ' he said . ' What about it ; do we start ? ' We told him the weather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he replied . ' We 'll probably run out of this stuff in half an hour , although it 's mighty poor around here . ' He turned to me , as the inexpert but graybeard pilot : ' What do you think ? ' I thought the weather was horrible , but my friend and the pilot were obviously all set to go , so I assented with such brightness as I could assume . We said good-byes , and climbed in . We took off forthwith . Our take-offs were always exciting , like our landings ; that is to say , a great deal seemed to be going on . Like all pilots , this pilot had ways of his own . At about eighty or ninety he took the weight off the wheels , but held her down to within a few feet of the ground until he had about a hundred and fifty miles an hour . As one looks ahead over the engine , the sense of speed is considerable , but peering out under the wing at the ground three feet away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vertical-bank climbing turn , which again is not a dull sensation , and thus brought himself out at about five hundred feet and facing the airport again . The operation is not possible , of course , except with a powerful machine . We squared away , just under the ragged clouds . The ground near the THE FLYING BANKER - e79 city was cut up into small fields . Mechanically I eyed possible landing places in case of engine failure , as no old-timer ? or new-timer , for that matter ? fails to do , however fine his engine . In our case , our aeroplane had only one fault , and that was its high landing speed ; and over involved country it was a very real fault . Notwithstanding designers ' efforts to the contrary , machines which fly fast also land fast . The higher your maximum speed , the higher your minimum , and if you fall below the latter you stall , lose the power of flight , and the machine dives violently until it regains speed . If You happen to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our machine was generally ' brought in ' to a landing at about one hundred and twenty miles per hour , so as to retain full control , and then , on straightening out for the actual landing , the speed was dropped to about sixty to seventy , at which speed the wheels touched ; being so perfectly streamlined , the machine took a long run without slackening . It had brakes , but you can not use these until going very slowly , or the machine will turn over on its nose . ' We needed a whole lot of territory to get down on , and on anything rough it took a lot of skill ; and if we had a crash we could be sure of one thing ? it would be at a nice high speed . If you disconnect the brakes of your car , and get it going at around seventy in a small field , you will grasp what I mean ; but not for long . However , the engine was going as smoothly as a sewing machine ; the ground @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just a little , then a little more , and soon we were up about a thousand feet . The sense of speed left us , except when we dashed through a cloud streamer . Rain blurred the windows at times , but quite suddenly the clouds broke all round us and patchesof strong sunlight lit us up ; and we nudged each other with relief and pleasure . I relaxed against the back of my seat ; the pilot wriggled a hand back through the little opening in the rear of his compartment and waved . Soon Des Moines came in sight , under our right wingtip , indistinct under the film that hangs over every city . We were now flying at about four thousand feet , seemingly suspended in the air while the distant earth very slowly unrolled below us . Tiny clouds , little masses of golden vapor , flicked past the windows sometimes . I gazed my fill at the immense pattern of thousands of fields , brown , gray , green , every autumn color , and all speckled with yellow sunlight and cloud shadows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ west , there was no break in the farms , unless for a town . Everywhere a vast fertility , the furrows marked on every field ; the rich earth seemed boundless ? America ! Ahead , the earth began to disappear beneath a wide curtain of smoke . In the smoke cloud one sometimes raw the flash of windows down the side of a tall building , or a faint white tower of offices . Over a gray-black rope that was the river , St. Paul was quite hidden under its own pall . The engine softened ; we began to glide . The earth became very distinct , and the sense of speed returned to us . We flashed over a line of hangars still five hundred feet up , and Minneapolis airport , enclosed in the white ring of an old concrete race track , lay beneath us . The pilot opened his engine up full at about a hundred feet , and we tore across the airport while he surveyed the ground . A sharp climbing turn , back down wind , then he turned right up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed ; I looked down at the inevitable high-tension wires along the side of the air- port . We slung level , the open end of a hangar flicked by the windows , the sense of terrific speed came back . Then , bumble-rumble , the loud noise of our wheels along the ground . We taxied to the concrete pavement by the hangars , and got out . It was a brilliant evening , very cold , the sky vivid orange , and all very Northern . We looked at our watches ; sitting quietly in our warm cabin , watching an unforgettable picture , we had come four hundred miles in two hours and twenty-six minutes ! The airport men gathered around and exclaimed , and perhaps disbelieved . I thought of the long overnight journey by train , and patted the glossy side of the machine when no one was looking . We carefully put her away in a hangar . Earth-bound , we bundled ourselves and our bags into an itinerant taxi ; the driver , overcome by his temporary environment , avid for speed , tried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side while we clutched each other in terror . Winter weather , that bane of long-distance flying , gave us a mist so thick that we could scarcely see the street beneath when we looked out the next morning . It drizzled , and it felt raw . Our next leg was a long one , straight out West , to Wyoming . It was not over any mail route , and we wanted fair weather , with our machine , for the trip . So we had to wait around , victims of irony , while the despised trains came and went . That evening I was electrified by newspaper headlines announcing another stock break . After the terrific smash we had had , with its primary and secondary breaks and all the rest of the performance , this was indeed startling news . I was overwhelmed again by the dead , hopeless feeling of wondering how bad it would be tomorrow and to-morrow . It is not a light matter to watch the work of years , into which the whole serious energies of one 's maturity have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ universal disaster . It is no light thing to think of the patient toil that must be begun to rebuild the shattered edifice stone by stone . I mooned about in the drizzle , feeling very low , particularly as I was so far away and helpless to do anything or to understand what was going on . So , even though preoccupied with sixteen-million-share days , Wall Street spared one of its little demons to come out , crouch on my shoulder , and claw my neck . All next day was the same , and sometimes we engaged in that most footless of occupations , cursing the weather . The evening papers revealed that the market in New York was still falling . Ignorant of the true conditions , my imagination ran only too wild , and with nothing to do but sit around and wait for the weather , I was rapidly becoming what the cowboys call ' spooky . ' The ensuing morning we were all in a mood to take off directly there was enough visibility to leave the ground . The airport was foggy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tanks were filled ; and we waited around , hoping it would clear . As our route did not go over any air line , we were ignorant of the conditions out West ; and , with all the uplift which was being showered on aviation , it seemed too bad that a great city like Minneapolis knew nothing whatever about the weather west of it . Around lunch time , the ceiling rose to about a thousand feet , and the ground visibility extended to about a mile . I telephoned from the airport office to the little town we were bound for ; there was no weather man , so I spoke with the local newspaper . An individual described the weather conditions as being very dull and cloudy ; it sounded about the same stuff as we had ; but he added that he did not expect any precipitation. 1 was to remember this na ? ve prophecy . Cheered , I reported my investigations . We had a council of war ; we were all sick of waiting , and agreed to take off and see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the engine , an operation which took about twenty minutes or more , for we never hurried over this most important preparation . We took off and reached the cloud ceiling in about a minute . Everything looked overcast and gloomy . We had laid out our exact course and set the dial of our earth inductor compass , so we started off . We began to cross the strings of little lakes west of Minneapolis , flying at about eight hundred feet , and around one hundred and sixty miles an hour . The ground was very broken , with lakes , clumps of trees , little fields , but as usual our engine was purring its steady , unvarying drone . Generally it was a sound we were never even conscious of unless it changed its note , but flying so low we listened to it intently , and there was an atmosphere of strain about the start of the flight . After a while , the country opened out into huge farms , with fields big enough even for us , and we relaxed a little . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as thick as ever , and the ceiling a shade lower . We did not go up through the clouds , because we had no idea of what lay ahead . No sound pilot will ever willingly fly above a thick cloud body unless it is known for a fact that the clouds are at a reasonable height above the destination ; for obviously you must eventually come down through the clouds , and if they happened to be very low-lying atthat place , you might fly right into the ground , for a fatal crash . It is a horrible sensation to be rushing at two miles a minute down through the clouds , knowing you are getting close to the earth , unable to see anything whatever , keeping level only by the instruments , straining your eyes into the gray opacity for the ground that may flash into view fifty feet or a thousand feet below you . Your height indicator tells you only your height above sea level , and you may be over a hill , or the whole terrain may be higher than you estimate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ least the ground immediately around us . The ceiling had become about two hundred feet . The clouds were very ragged , and the late afternoon light was almost all reflected up from the snow , giving an unearthly effect . The desolate snow-clad land was constantly rising to the west , and becoming hummocky , with deep washes or gullies ; the clouds steadily became a little lower ; so the two were coming together with our hurrying aeroplane in the middle . Another half hour went by ; we dashed through several snow flurries , and I began to be worried lest we were getting into a really dangerous situation , with no even reasonably good landing places anywhere . Our high landing speed was always in our minds . I hurriedly scribbled a note to the pilot , on the back of a map : ? This weather is getting much worse ; suggest turn back and try find some town and land there . He considered the note , then pushed back his reply . I had to lean against the window to read it , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miles due east of finish . Believe we can make it O.K. What say ? I looked out ; from moment to moment we rushed farther into solitude ? nothing but snow and the endless sullen clouds . I did not consult my friend , although he owned the machine ; the pilot and I had been piloting for many years , and it seemed to me that seconds counted . I started to write a reply suggesting that we turn round anyway ; in the middle of it , I suddenly saw a dark wall right in front of us , and the next second the light was all but blotted out by a dense blizzard . Instantly I heard the engine throttled ; the nose fell as we tried to keep the ground in sight . For a few moments , engine on and off , we fumbled for it at nearly three miles a minute , in a dense mist of swirling snow ; then it flashed into view very indistinctly , about twenty feet below . The pilot was struggling frantically to open a little triangular window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the front glass and he had only a side view . He got it open , and the cold air and snow rushed into the machine . He throttled back all he could , but even so our speed was terrific for the conditions , over two , hundred feet a second . We could see barely half a second of time ahead . I crouched on one knee on the floor , trying to look out of both sides at once . A white flash of snow-clad hilltop snapped by right under the wheels , so swiftly that it was a bare impression on my senses ; then a gray blur as we crossed one of the wide gullies between these flat-topped hillocks ; then another instantaneous flash of light , a blur , and so on . In all our minds was the thought , suppose one of these hills is higher ? The pilot had the worst of it ; I could just see him , one hand on the throttle , the other on the control stick , his head strained forward , trying to see through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horrible crash when a machine , caught in just such a storm , had flown right into Mount Taylor and killed every soul aboard . As I looked from side to side , every muscle tense , making instinctive motions with an imaginary control stick as we caught each glimpse of ground , I raged at myself for being so frightened . But with nothing to do I could only crouch motionless and await each second . I swore monotonously to my . self . Sometimes we caught a little area of visibility , two hundred yards perhaps , and we had a momentary relief ; then the snow clamped down again . It was getting very dark . I could not recall ever having been in such a desperate situation before for so long a time , even in the war ; for a fight in the air was absolutely decisive within literally a few seconds ? then it was all over one way or the other . This went on and on , none of us knowing whether or not the next second we should know anything at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known it had we hit , but the thought does n't help at such a time . Self-preservation is dominant ; you want Life ? all of it . We cursed our high landing speed ; with a slow machine we could have effected some sort of landing , but with ours we should have been certain of a bad crash . I looked with longing at each patch of snowy ground ; we all wanted tremendously to set our feet safely on it ? so near , only ten or twenty feet , but how very far it was ! We all knew that the survival of each approaching minute was largely a toss-up . To try to execute a turn under such conditions was possible , but most tricky . Besides , the wind was from the north , and the blizzard probably covered our course from the east ; south of us lay the western end of the Bad Lands of South Dakota , so that was closed . The blizzard was coming from // the north ; somewhere ahead of us was our destination , just between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only one chance . As we peered out , we knew that if we missed this little town sitting out in the middle of the prairie we should pass on to a range of mountains ten thousand feet high . The town was a small mark to hit , after flying five hundred miles on a compass course . Right in front of the pilot 's face was a little dial with a swinging upturned needle ; as long as he maintained the set course the needle remained bolt upright , and he had to try to keep one eye on it all the time , holding his feet rock-steady on the rudder bar , resisting the instinctive flinch to one side when we nearly touched the ground . If we missed the little town by only two or three hundred yards , we could never see it in the gloom . The thought passed through my mind that they would never find us until the spring . Fifteen , twenty , thirty minutes of this miserable , solitary groping passed by ? hours in our minds . Tearing along at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sides , one 's head against the curved roof , of a small polished cylinder of plywood with a mass of roaring steel at the fore end , going headlong into the unknown ? it was , if nothing else , a cure for the sorrows of the stock market . There was now scarcely any light ; visions raced through my mind of happy people switching on the electric light in warm rooms . The luxury of throwing another log on the fire , of listening to the comfortable crackle of the burning wood ! To be down , anywhere , in the humblest shack ! The good feel of the solid quiet earth under one 's feet ? to stride over it , swinging one 's arms and legs ! The looking for-ward to the coming days , the continuity of life ! We crouched , weary and intensely alert . Without the slightest warning , a few houses and a road burst into view , the chimneys about level with our tires . We all yelled at once . We were going so fast that we were right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; but quick as was the amazing alteration from solitude to civilization , men in danger think mighty fast , and almost in the same eventful instant we swung violently over on one wing . As I braced to the whirling turn I peered directly past the undercarriage wheels , now higher than the horizon , and saw the blurred shape of a big dome , above us ! We had nearly flown directly into the Court House ! The turn took us up a few feet , and the lighted streets disappeared from view . We leveled off , the nose went down , and they came into view again . It was just possible to see the ground , unless we were looking right into strong lights . Level for only a moment , a wingtip fell beneath us as we commenced circling just above the rooftops , looking for somewhere on the outskirts of town to land . We knew there was a landing field two or three miles north , but we 'd never seen it , and we did n't dare leave the town now that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never find it again . The snow was as thick as ever . Our turns were always nearly vertical and very rapid , because in a fast machine the turning circle is of large diameter , and it was difficult to stay over any one area close beneath us long enough to examine it . We found a football ground in an oval enclosure ; it was beautifully smooth , but it became only too plain that we could never pull up in such a space . Regretfully we turned away , coming level for a moment after having pirouetted on one wingtip for several minutes . We were all tremendously relieved to have the houses beneath us . After the horrible desolation of the snow .. covered empty plains , this little town looked most beautiful ; every signboard and store and street was a lovely sight to us . It still looked as though we should have a crash landing , but the psychological effect of knowing that plenty of our fellow beings were near us was tremendous . We hunted all round the edges of town . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brown ruts showed through the snow , but the telegraph posts were well to one side : it looked as if we could get down on to it somehow , assuming perfect piloting , of course , and preparing for a crash of some sort toward the end of the run . This area we examined most thoroughly , up and down , up and down , while the pilot took in all the hazards . The pilot had just about decided to go to it and essay the road landing , when he caught sight of another possibility and started to examine that . It was a triangular patch of land , with telephone poles along the down-wind side , and a farm and gully at the far end . A road to the farm ran up one side , and there were some low buildings alongside the telephone wires . The pilot went down to ten or fifteen feet for a second or two , to see the ground contours ; the snow carpet looked very level , and he assumed that the snow could not be more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; quickly he made up his mind . I heard a rapid clanking jiggle aft as he set the adjustable tail surface into landing position . Up we went into the dense snow cloud ; the engine note abruptly sank to a whisper , the right wingtip dipped until it was directly below us . We went down in a vertical sideslip ; the earth flashed into view so close that we seemed to have reached it . We lev eled out very violently just past the telephone poles . For a moment , there was a level glide at about sixty , then I felt the tail drop a little . The snow brushed our wheels . The side of my face was glued to a window as I squinted ahead . The farm and ravine tore toward us . We bumped roughly once , twice ; then the familiar loud rumble of the wheels . We were still going very fast . The brakes squealed suddenly , and I felt rather than saw the pilot pull the stick hard back into his stomach to hold the tail down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with all its legs stiff before it . At the last second , the pilot stood right up on one brake , and we ground-looped and made a complete turn . She did n't turn over ; she stopped dead , almost silent , the engine whispering quietly round . We were down . We stood on the ground with the snow swirling around us in the half light and soaking into our shoes . We did not speak . I was still trembling all over with the tension of the past half hour . The pilot 's face looked gray from the terrific strain of flying a few feet above the ground at two and a half miles a minute , trying to watch his earth inductor compass indicator and pierce the blanket ahead at the same time , one hand on the throttle , the other on the stick . He had accomplished a superb piece of flying . We stared down into the ravine beside the machine . Men came rushing up in the gloom , big , muffled-up , Scandinavian-looking fellows , eager to help . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw our arms round them . Some of them ran off to get us stakes to peg down with ; the others stood around ready to help us in any way they could . We decided to tie her down at the far end of the field near the telegraph poles . I ran along to see if there were any holes covered by the snow . I fell into two big ones a few yards from the tracks we had made coming in . Had we chanced to strike them , we should have crashed to splinters . I ran hack , rejoicing in the ability to run again , and pointed out the holes . The pilot climbed back in to taxi the plane down . She . had settled into the ground , and he opened up the throttle to pull her out . As he did so , the engine gave two or three stentorian clanking coughs , and died . He got out and we examined it ; then we stared at each other , speechless . Those few clanks were the footsteps of the gods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intake was jammed with ice . The engine would keep going wide open or nearly stopped , but if the throttle was opened up suddenly she choked to a standstill . If the pilot had happened to cut his engine for a moment , after we had got well into the blizzard , he would never have got it again , and we should have flown squarely into whatever was there . We silently cleaned out the ice , restarted the engine , and took the plane to her resting place and pegged her down , while the cold wind blew the snow into our eyes . Then someone took us in his sedan and drove us , still quiet and filled with a sense of unreality , to the hotel . We could n't get used to the fact that we were really down , jogging peacefully along lighted streets , able to stop and get out at any moment , warm houses all about us . We registered ; the hotel was old , quaint to our eyes , with wide mahogany staircases , an army of cuspidors , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all still quite silent . We sat with our shoes steaming and sizzling against the radiators , looking at the murk out side . After a while we started to talk our heads off ; we went over every mile of the journey and especially the blizzard , and the pilot compared notes with us . We told each other what we 'd thought of the football ground , the road , the eventual field . Then we were all hungry , for we 'd had nothing since breakfast . We trooped down , our shoes dried and warmed , into the dining room . The floors were of whitish tile and the chair legs squeaked on it . We had a large dinner , ham and eggs and browned potatoes and pie and lashings of coffee ; it was grand , and we all felt very well . We went out into the lobby , and as we stood there by the dining-room door a Western Union boy brought me a telegram . I remembered having wired our destination to my secretary , sometime that seemed months ago , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read the message , and as I did so I realized , with a sense of shock , that the game was up . The closing prices , the comments of my secretary , showed a perpendicular smash ; at the opening next morning I should be broke , ' busted sky-high . ' Prices had been falling wildly at the closing gong ; here was I nearly three thousand miles away , powerless to do a thing . There was nothing to do . I looked up ; it was a funny sensation , standing there and realizing that a good many years of work had gone glimmering , that the shadow which had been hanging overhead had really fallen at last . Then the scales fell from my eyes ; wonderingly , I realized that I did n't care a hang ! I was alive ! A little while before , I had been hurtling through the air , never expecting to see another hour , another minute , maybe ; and here I was , warm under the lights . I thought of the dark desolation a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the telegram was meaningless . I threw it into a cuspidor . Here was I alive and strong , a whole world full of exciting things before me ; for once I had a grasp on reality , I felt my feet spread firmly on the ground . My two companions stood looking curiously at me . Men , ' I said , I 'm busted wide open , but what the hell ! And who cares , if I do n't ? Come on ? movies ! Talkies ! ' We tramped arm in arm through the snow . I had never felt better . I had a feeling of release , a freedom I had n't known for many a year . My money was gone ; but that event was quite overshadowed by the realization of all the wonderful things there were about me , before me , which I had so narrowly missed knowing any more about . I felt clearly that , given soundness in wind and limb , there was nothing I 'd ever done that I could n't start right over and do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of a moment ? I felt it right in my bones , although heaven knows it had taken enough to get it into me . A whole lot of complicated things seemed rather stupid , and another lot of simple ones came into focus , like the screen image when you set your camera right . The movie was fine ? commonplace enough , but we all felt that gayety which needs no cocktail to get it going , and we went to be amused , so we were . It changed our thoughts completely for an hour or two , and eased off the tension . We strolled peacefully back past all the little shops , their windows beaded with the inside moisture , looking at everything as though we 'd just come in from the farm for a big night in town . I passed the Western Union office without a pang . I was glad , for I was half afraid the care-free mood would wear off . It was a wonderful night , the clean wind straight off the prairie . I slept splen. didly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looking over a little silica mine in which we were interested . I had a little hope that sometime , by the time I was getting old , perhaps , it might pay back a few dollars , but the hope seemed insecurely founded . For my part , I crossed my fingers and made a wish that it would manage to break even , for I had nothing more to put into it . We spent these days out in the mine shacks , by the edge of the mountains , pine and spruce trees covering the slopes . I did n't want to leave , but the mine foreman 's wife summed it up for me : Wish you were staying , son ; but I s'pose ye ca n't live on mountain scenery and fresh rabbit tracks ! ' We got ready to start home , loading up the tanks with every gallon of gas and oil we could carry . On our big map was a long pencil line drawn against a ruler , across five states , Wyoming , South Dakota , Nebraska , Kansas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand . I looked through the clear air at the sparkling view , mountains , plains , great stretches of clean space everywhere , and found myself humming a tune I 'd heard Eddie Cantor sing , starting off , ' Oh ! I 'm glad to be alive ! ' With eel-like squirms , the pilot crawled through the little opening behind him , where the padded back of his seat was hinged to the roof ; he held the stick at arm 's length while I contorted myself past him into the pilot 's seat . The machine rose and fell uneasily as our hands joggled the stick . I glanced over the many dials ; everything was going like clockwork ; the air-speed indicator trembled around a hundred and fifty-five . A scarcely noticeable pressure on stick and rudder brought us dead on our course , with the compass indicator needle bolt upright . The golden afternoon wore on as we tore over the dense pattern of fields and farms and industrial towns ; many an airport we saw , and once we dashed past a tri-motored transport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Behind us we could see nothing now but a vast golden haze that shrouded even the ground ; only rivers gleamed dully through it . Then things ahead became more indistinct , lights began to appear . The pilot took over from me , and kept her nose down , for we were cutting it pretty fine for the light . Gradually we worked down to about a thousand , going wide open at about a hundred and seventy . The automobile lights , the town lamps , and the shop windows shone up to us diamond clear , for we did not have to look along any ground haze . I sat aft , overcome by the thrill of this last ten minutes . A constant stream of bright sparks from our exhaust flew by the windows ; the electric red and green lights shone steadily at the wingtips ; in front of the pilot , the radium dials glowed softly with their strange fluorescence . Every few minutes we passed over the brilliant light of an airway beacon , for we were now following the route of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could see the next one flashing in the distance ahead . For the last five minutes it was very dark . We came in over the landing field ; all the buildings were outlined in colored lights , and it looked like some fair . The instant we were heard , the flood lights were switched on , turning the field white beneath us . With his same technique , the pilot swept the field ten feet from the concrete runway ; then we curved up into the dark night , away from the glare of the flood lights . I heard the stabilizer being set , and we swung over on one wing , down in a vicious sideslip . This last stone-like drop through the dark was the salutation of farewell ; we swung level , and rolled quietly along the concrete . Friends were waiting for us . After the first greetings , one of them began talking to me about the market . He thought that it must be uppermost in my mind ; but for two blessed days I had n't thought about it . My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight , and it was a minute or two before I grasped what he was trying to tell me . Then another shock , another anticlimax ! For the morning after our blizzard had been the turning point in the Street , and the market had opened higher and was still going up . In one breath I passed from serenity to irritable impatience for a newspaper . When I got one , it looked as though I had really been reprieved . The beauty of our great flight dropped from me . Without another glance at the shining aeroplane , I hurried into town . On long distance I got a bank officer at his home , and with the air of a man who says , ' The lightning struck close to you that time , my boy , ' he told me that I was still in the ring . Do it again ? Yes , I hope so ; but , like everything else in life , never again in quite the same way ; for a few months later the pilot , poor fellow , forgot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great storm . A few seconds later , he and his passengers were dead and our faithful machine crushed into a silent pile of utterly shattered wood and steel . If you go at it so , it 's the flip of a coin ; a hundred spins , it 's heads , and you 're a brilliant fellow ; then it spins tails , and you 're out .
