In 1908 , Lucio &; Simplicio Godino , Filipinos , were born on the Island of Samar in the Philippines . Due to a monstrous accident of gestation , they were firmly bound at the tail bones by a link of muscle , fibre and intestine . Simplicio 's digestive tract ended in a blind pocket of gut about half an inch short of where it should have ended . He drained through the connecting link into his Brother Lucio 's normal colon . <P> Except for the linkage of their bowels , the twins were normal entities . They differed slightly in size , considerably in temperament . Lucio , the smaller , was impetuous , the leader . He usually walked forward , while bigger , more phlegmatic Simplicio trailed backward . Simplicio habitually slept on his right side , Lucio on his left . Thus Lucio 's heart had more work to do at night than Simplicio 's , a fact which may have contributed to their differences , for being identical twins , product of the same ovum , they should have been mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lucio Godino made world news by applying for licenses to marry Natividad and Victorina Motos in Manila . The marriage license clerk objected for fear of compounding collateral bigamy but the sisters and brothers eventually were married . They organized a vaudeville act in which they danced , saxophoned and bantered through South and North America . <P> Last month they played in Greenville , N. C. From Greenville the bivalent Godinos motored to Manhattan where they rented an apartment in the theatrical district off Broadway . Lucio had caught a nasty cold during the motor trip . Soon he called in Dr. Benjamin Fabricant , a young physician four years out of New York University Medical School who had an office in the Godinos ' apartment building . When the cold proved to be pneumonia , Dr. Fabricant sent sick Lucio and healthy Simplicio to York Hospital , a small private institution . The Press discovered the case , piled into the hospital , photographed the strange sickbed , the grieving wives , reported that Simplicio was ravenous for a cigaret , irked that Lucio 's illness prohibited him from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Lucio Godino died . <P> At any time in their lives the Godinos could have undergone a comparatively simple operation , got free of each other . <P> They preferred to remain joined because their affliction was their livelihood . Most Siamese twins have the same idea . When Surgeon Hippolyte Marcus Wertheim of York Hospital cut ( without anesthesia ) dead Lucio away from live Simplicio , he was performing the first operation of its kind on adult Siamese twins . <P> The Godino link was 24 in. in circumference , 3 in. long . Within a few hours of Lucio 's death , Dr. Wertheim perforated Simplicio 's anus , brought down the blind end of the gut , snipped it open and stitched it to the rim of the new opening . <P> He then closed the old opening in the man 's loin . In a week or two Simplicio Godino will be out of the hospital , obliged to learn and earn an entirely new way of living .                @ @ @ @ @
