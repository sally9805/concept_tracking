II F OR four years of the depression men hoped and fought , but about March , 1933 , they lost , hope . Industrial management sought to abdicate . There may have been men in this country who thought that we should continue to do nothing about it  --  still to sit and suffer  --  but I do not know who they were . There was hardly an industrial , economic , financial , commercial or agricultural leader who did not advance some idea of governmental intervention . A snowfall of paper plans drifted about the Capitol , and there was not one of them that would not , in some measure , have modified the Antitrust Acts . Some of the plans emanating from very throne rooms of industry were fantastic ; for example , that every factory in the United States should  --  under Government subsidy and on a given day  --  suddenly blow the whistles and start up at once on the 1929 rate of production  --  the idea being that this would instantly restore 1929 employment and consumption and bring back the rare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss of a Prince Charming awoke not only the Sleeping Beauty but also the whole retinue of the enchanted palace . It overlooked our loss of foreign trade , the fact that the consuming power of agriculture was still paralyzed , and the wreckage of debt and bankruptcy from the great delusion . Another plan provided for immediate Government loans of billions to all industry on deferred priority , on the theory that this would pay off prior liens and release purchasing power . There were others proposing a complete dictatorship and the immediate adoption of the Fascist corporate state . One which is being again put forward is that factories start , and the Government will buy all that the people do not buy . The Damoclean Sword of Surplus H AVE N'T we had enough of unmanageable sur- plus ? If the presence of it hanging over a market will destroy agriculture , why will it not destroy industry ? What all such plans fail to realize is that it is not a loss of industrial turnover of eight or ten billions a year that keeps us down . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't restore that by anything the Government can do directly . Even this Government could not entertain any such outlay . We must seek to activate our private economic mechanism , not to substitute a political mechanism . All these plans seemed to present insurmountable obstacles and none to meet the problems just discussed . Out of the paper drifts , there soon began to emerge the new financial , banking , bankruptcy and loan-lifting legislation , the Farm Acts and the Recovery Act . We are here concerned only with the latter , but we must always remember that it was intended to be only part of an integrated legislative whole which President Roosevelt had sketched in very broad outlines during the summer of 1932 . The economic cataclysm of March , 1933 , cried out that if anything were to be done under the various emergency acts , it must be done quickly . As monetary , farm , debt and industrial legislation began to take shape , a new peril began to appear . It was less obvious in form than the deep collapse , but even more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production and prices entered an upward spiral which threatened a runaway . The cause was clear enough . Many people thought that threatened currency depreciation , increased wages under NRA , and the processing tax would instantly be reflected in an exactly proportional increase in the whole price schedule . They hurried to turn their money into goods to take advantage of this expected artificial rise . Nobody knew the extent of possible effects of the new projects , and all manufacturers likely to be affected tried to beat the gun by producing as much as possible before the processing tax could become effective , and before labor wages should be raised by conditions expected to be contained in the Codes . Warehouses began to fill up with cotton gray goods , sometimes purchased by men who were not even in the textile business . Everybody was stocking up on all staples and a false industrial activity started with a bang . Except in isolated cases , wage scales , under this impetus and before NRA , were not improving , and employment was not increasing proportionately with production . Purchasing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ production . In short , there was threatened a new mountain of undigested and indigestible goods and , of course , a new wave of unemployment and despair . The country was in no temper to stand such a setback of hope and expectation . In every past recovery , improvement in wages and working conditions had always conspicuously lagged behind improvement in prices and production . This has invariably produced a temporary secondary reaction punctuated by decreased consumption , sagging prices , strikes , labor unrest and , finally , improved wages . But in this ease , the price and production increases were so steep and so strongly stimulated , the depths from which they rose so disastrous and the wage lag so stubborn , that then , as never before , speed and action were absolutely necessary . The Recovery Act was included in the general plan for the very purpose of eliminating any lag at all in wages and employment , and of remodeling the usual trend to the end of producing a steady recovery at an equable and uninterrupted rate . But the extraordinary phenomenon of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which would brook no delay . Long before the actual Farm Bill was presented , B. M. Baruch and I had been discussing these problems with George Sloan and Nelson Slater , of the cotton-textile industry , the packers , and Jim Bell , of General Mills Company , trying to get some spontaneous industrial support of what had been proposed in the campaign as the economic policy of the new administration . It did not seem to succeed too well , except with the cotton-textile people . They responded at once , and to this good day they have not . faltered . But in the light of my experience with the industrialists , I have never doubted . that wo could have reached prompt and complete agreement with both millers and packers . A little later Secretary Wallace offered B. M. the job of Administrator of the Agricultural Adjustment Act , later accepted by George Peek . Bernie felt that someone better known to farmers should take that job . The incident is interesting because if the task had been accepted , there is no doubt that both George @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ B. M. and the NRA effort might have been better directed . All this happened to be in connection with the proposed Farm Bill  --  a subject on which Mr. Peek and I had spent much study and he much effort . George Peek was at last called in on that. , and so were B. M. and myself , but not until after Henry Morgenthau and . Rex Tugwell had given it cast and direction . Our idea was that the way to restrict the surplus production that for ten years had ruined agriculture was to rent or purchase , and let lie fallow , the surplus-producing acreage , which could have been done at that time at not too great a cost . We had worked out a complete plan for doing it . That idea suffered shipwreck on the proposition of Dr. Mordecai Ezekiel that it is economic law that you can not rent any land except at the gross value of its potential product  --  for example , that an Iowa farm producing twenty-five bushels of corn per acre at fifty cents a bushel could not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cents per acre . We had conducted a practical survey which indicated that all surplus-producing acreage in the United States could be rented at an average of three dollars an acre . But you could not get by the dictum of Doctor Ezekiel : " That is not the economics of the situation . " And this to George Peek , who has made his living in the corn lands from so far back that he would hate to hear the toll of years so much as mentioned ! One day , walking into the President 's office , I was so deeply engrossed in a warm discussion with the good doctor , and not realizing that we were clear inside that office , I replied to his " That is not good economics " with a rather ribald remark about good economics , and it fell on one of those curious silences that carried it clear across the room . I saw the President 's eyes twinkle and I almost swallowed my tongue . On the meat situation we had a simple proposition that , for giving the packers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to support the increased costs and permitting them to consolidate their multifarious distributing systems to reduce cost of distribution  --  all under governmental supervision  --  they were to pay farmers the prewar parity price for animal farm products and part of the savings in distribution , with several more or less technical provisions to prevent shifts to substitutive foodstuffs . I do n't know what . rock that split on . Some talk there was of killing little pigs and sterilizing sows and plowing under cotton  --  all of which the Democrats had scornfully condemned in the campaign . By this time  --  in spite of ten or twelve years sporadically , the past several months intensively , spent on this problem  --  the whole subject had become too technical and esoteric for my comprehension , and I went back to New York convinced that Doctor Ezekiel is one of the best , mathematicians in the country . It was not very Jong after the friendly passage at arms with Doctor Ezekiel over the Farm Bill that one day when B. M. Baruch and I were returning from a hunting trip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hotel , Washington . He said that the draft of an industrial act was an immediate necessity and , recalling our many studies of the subject , our frequent talks with him , and B. M. 's experience in the mobilization of industry , asked . if I could not be loaned to him to draw up such a bill . At that time , neither he nor we had the slightest idea that anybody else was drawing up such a document . Mr. Baruch readily assented , and I went over to Ray 's office that afternoon . Indeed , I never went to my New York home from that day to the end of my service except to get my clothes , and rarely even so much as saw my own family . The First Draft of the Recovery , /Pct TEW DOUGLAS was the fair-haired boy LA in Washington at that time . Our studies of the budget had been of service to him . We had spent a year on them and had forced a recast of the expert Treasury figures . We had loaned him Alvin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  a boy whom I had " brought up " ? one of the keenest and quickest analytical and practical minds in this country . Lew Douglas said the President wanted a short bill drawn up in the broadest of terms . I wrote the Recovery Act on a sheet and a half of legal cap paper , and I have always thought , and still think , that it was far superior to the involved and obscure statute with which we are now struggling . I wish I could write it over again . On the main points of ' the bill , I felt relatively confident . It was a subject which B. M. and I had been studying off and on for years . For nearly a year , Alex Sachs  --  who became the first Chief of our Research and Planning Division  --  and I had conjectured roughly on the steps and action necessary to success . Mere activation of the consumers ' - goods industries , we felt quite sure , would not be enough . Even that would not be an easy thing to do unless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we thought we knew how to do that  --  in exactly the way it was actually done . But a cursory glance at the figures on unemployment showed that the bulk of unemployment was in the heavy , or capital , goods industries which were in almost complete collapse , and that , unless substantial re-employment could be had there , a mere activation of consumers ' goods must certainly fail , because it left a disparity too wide and too deep in the consuming population of the country . We computed that plenary authority to lend or extend from a three or four billion dollar appropriation , money for the purpose we had in mind relative to heavy goods , on any terms the President might choose , taking away all restrictions on RFC and the Federal Reserve under the old law , would do the trick . In drafting the statute we preferred to . and did , give authority to construct , finance or aid in the construction or financing of low-cost housing and renewal and repair of homes . A provision which lay dormant for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a program on these powers which we then thought . would re-employ 1,000,000 men in capital-goods industries by October 1 , 1933 . Our conclusions were : " ( al That a shortening or hours and increase of wages coupled with the repression of prices to only such increases as would ( Continued 13 1.7 Page 83 ) // accommodate increased out-of-pocket costs due to improved hours and wages  --  relying for profits on increased volume rather than increased price  --  would help to institute and sustain recovery . " ( b ) That , to be effective , such a result would have to be produced in an extraordinarily short space of time . " ( e ) That , while it would not be too difficult thus to produce the required results in the consumer-goods industries , it was a much more difficult job in the heavy-goods industries . " ( d ) That , by vigorous and immediate administration , it should be at least possible to put 3,000,000 men to work in the consumers ' - goods and 1,000,000 in the heavy-goods industries within from three to four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my mind . Alex Sachs is one of the best men in the country on this particular kind of work . Like few others of his profession , he has a record of prophesying correctly . Over and over again he impressed on me the absolute necessity of activating capital goods in unison with consumers ' goods , and warned me that any other result meant failure . These were deliberate studies , which began to take definite form in charts and graphs early in the year , becoming more definite as we were whipping the Bill into shape . But as passage of the Bill dragged through Congress and as the extraordinary speculative or beatthe-gun boom began to cast its shadow forward , it became very apparent that , without a great amount of action anticipating the statute , there was little hope of avoiding a new buyers ' strike , a new and serious secondary reaction , with disastrous effects on the Recovery Program , the extent of which it was difficult , at that time , to gauge . An Army on Wheels In more detail our plans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies of the world are rapidly being mechanized and motorized . It puts men behind steel shields instead of opposing to shrapnel , rifle and machine-gun fire nothing but soft and yielding human flesh . It so increases speed and mobility of getting to critical points on any battleground that a very few men so equipped can do the work of a very great many under the old . armament . It so increases the fire power of any group of soldiers , from a corporal 's squad to a field army , that the figures would not be believed if I quoted them . Finally , to send an army out not so armed against one that is so provided is like sending naked men with bows and arrows in a canoe against a modern battleship . It is a life-saver , a home sayer and a necessary element of defense . Furthermore , this is an expenditure that this country will have to make sooner or later . We wrote into that Bill authority to make it now , in this necessary emergency spending , instead of spending a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having to spend this money also . Such expenditures were practically all designed to go directly into the heavy , or durable-goods , industries for steel , motors , electrical equipment , tractors , caterpillars and machinery of all types . We wrote in a provision for vast naval construction which  --  to our astonishment  --  was never even questioned and which is now in effect , although I fear that it is not progressing very rapidly . We never even discussed that naval provision with anybody . I simplywrote it in on a gamble , much as I had written " to raise by draft " in the Selective Service Act , fully expecting to see it torn out by the roots . Tawas never seriously contested . The Small  --  Housing Plan Our studies showed that , though there is plenty of apartment-house , hotel and office construction , that is not true of small independent housing . They indicated the argument and difficulty to be expected in city slum clearance with real-estate people and city governments and the delay of demolition , but showed the facility and usefulness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to go thirty or forty miles outside of the great industrial and commercial centers , buy up tracts of land , allowing three or four acres to each of several thousand families for fruit and vegetable raising , cow , pig and chicken keeping  --  the elements of self-subsistence  --  and then to construct both large modern apartments with cheap per-room overhead costs and also small cottages . These , linked to the urban centers of employment by special economical rapid-transit facilities , we thought , would alleviate the distress of complete or partial unemployment and also put a basis of individual stability under families victimized by the depression . There is a difference between such installations and so-called " subsistence homesteads . " The idea here is not to ruralize surplus industrial workers , but to give them a source of food beyond their wages and thus to provide a safety valve against suffering due to unemployment . It differs also from plans to decentralize and ruralize industry itself  --  which would revise a natural law and , in my opinion , be a long , difficult and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important advantage over slum clearance . The Government would not have to wait on real-estate hoards , the doubtful inducement of cheap loans , or any other discretion outside itself . All it had to do was what it did in the war . Then , within a few months , the Government built miniature cities which eventually housed something like 4,000,000 mon . Under this idea the Government could make and execute its own plans  --  which are not difficult  --  and then proceed without asking leave of anybody . Complete and unlimited authority to do just that was written in Title Ii . We felt that it would provide a great deal of the employment so sorely needed in the building trades . This idea grew out of the plan I had made in connection with the use of relief funds for the San Francisco earthquake and fire in 1906 . Of course , its success depended on a. type of architecture and construction that would result in Roadhouses , but houses erected on such a basis of economy as would ( Continued en Peg . 85 ) ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of the people we were trying to accommodate . There was also written in to that Title  --  II  --  plenary authority to loan or spend money for railroad electrification , equipment , re-equipment of rolling stock and rights of way or elimination of grade crossings on any terms of interest or priority which the administration might see fit to exact . We had already negotiated on that with a few railroad presidents and also talked about a plan to eliminate grade crossings everywhere by a plan to share the expense of doing so . To make it very apparent that Title II intended action , we wrote in the words preceding the enabling clauses " with a view to increasing employment quickly . " In order not to hamper administra tion of Title II in the eventual choice of someone else as administrator , we had , with the President 's assent , detailed Col. George Spalding from the Army , where he is regarded , with three or four others , as a fit successor to General Goethels . He is one of the best engineers and executives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a great many other outstanding executives and engineers as a preparatory staff , anticipating the Act , and they were working like beavers . If it were all to have been done over again , I would have written the statute to provide for an administrator with a small Advisory Board of the best construction experts in the country , but I would have used as Executive Officer , Gen. Edward Markham , now Chief of Engineers of the United States Army . I would have built the whole decentralized territorial organization upon the basis and the pattern of the existing system of the Engineer Corps , supplementing each district engineer with a staff of civilian engineers , architects and construction experts . It would have saved enormously in overhead . It would have accelerated speed . It would have removed worry about speculation , favoritism and graft . Mobilizing the Workers Out of all these projects , and with this organization , we had prepared a. plan and gone far enough with work looking toward putting it into execution to convince us that we were justified in the original @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy goods and construction , under Title II , by the first of October . This , with 3,000,000 which , from our studies , we thought we could put to work under Title I , gave the estimate of 4,000,000 men back to work by October . We regarded these two plans , NRA and PWA as complementary and necessary to each other . We thought that if we could not get the construction and heavy-goods industries into operation along with consumers ' goods , there would not he enough balanced buying power to sustain the re-employment in commerce , the lighter manufacturers and auxiliary services . That is how we planned . That is how we wrote the Bill . We confidently believed that with the benefits to agriculture from the Farm Acts , coupled with re-employment under both Title I and Title IL there would be a sufficient forward surge in purchase and employment to absorb the expected speculative production and price boom  --  which actually came  --  and really start normal recovery into a balanced and sustained upward cycle . Furthermore , from the magnificent job that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole plan of NIRA on further assumptions which , perhaps , we had no right to indulge . One was that the monetary policy  --  whatever might be decided upon  --  would be definite and stable , and the other was that the Agricultural Adjustment Act would be carried into immediate execution , with quick effect . In brief , we looked upon the Recovery Program as an integrated whole which , through some central co-ordinating agency , would be driven abreast , so that the whole artificial pressure to start an upward spiral of business and employment would proceed as one combined push , exercising all force at once and never permitting the frittering away of force by applying it in spaced impulses or , worse , the cancellation of one effect by the effect of another . These considerations are highly important in appraising the rest of the record . The Labor Angle There was one point on which I felt weak  --  the labor point of view . Although I had managed or been responsible for large industrial enterprises , I had never had any trouble with labor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I only knew by reading and discussion what the main points of difference were . My only contact with the American Federation had been with Sam Gompers during the war and once or twice during the fight for farm relief . He had upheld my hands at every turn , and a real comradeship had existed between us during the war . But he was gone and that time was fifteen years removed . I began to inquire for somebody to help me . I had never heard of Mr. Richberg , but he was recommended to me as a brilliant unknown . I made further inquiries , and was told that he was a subtle and astute lawyer , reputed to be a progressive , a successful lobbyist , associated with the Railroad Brotherhoods rather than the Federation , but he was thought to possess the confidence of labor . I sent and asked him to work with me on the Bill . We seemed to strike it off at once . I liked him and I thought he liked me . He made several suggestions and we drafted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any statute , in this uncharted sea , must be very flexible . It should try to foresee everything . But if it attempts to state a specific rule of action for any predictable event , that rule will be invariable . Here we were facing an unknown problem for which there was no rule  --  a virtual reorientation of an economic universe . There could be no invariable dicta .. There could be no inflexibility . We must reserve the right to try , fail , change and try again , and to make these alterations instantly upon the discovery of mistakes . It was for this reason that we made authority as wide and as general as possible . Another point  --  we could not move on anybody 's more conjecture of what might be the effect of a particular plan . For example , some au thori ties ? thinking from the basis of an entirely different statutory structure  --  conclude that the basing-point system of sales may tend toward monopoly . NRA had to take the position that a large segment of American business is done under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discernible monopolistic . tendency in practice . It was the business of NRA to see what the defects of such a system were , to correct them , and learn by experience whether they are monopolistic in fact . Now , this ca n't be done by cloistered academic speculation . In writing the Bill , the method we invented  --  for there was no precedent  --  and later used , was : Industry was to make a proposal . 2 . It was to be submitted to a public hearing . 3 . Within NRA itself were departments made up of accredited representatives of the three conflicting in-terests : ( a ) Industry . ( b ) Labor . ( c ) Consumers . It was to be their business to point out every Code proposal which they thought might bear harshly or unfairly on the interests they represented . They voiced and supported their protest and , be assured , they did it . The boards not only were to do this themselves but they were to activate and assist all public or private groups of similar interest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest were then to be digested and the Deputy Administrator was to seek to compose as many as could be composed by conference . 5 . The Administrator himself then , with the aid of the Department of Research and Planning and the Legal Department , was to seek either to get complete agreement of all conflicting interest , which was generally done , or else to narrow the field of disagreement to a point where a final decision , to be recommended to the President , would produce the maximum of fairness and justice and the minimum of harm to all interests . Of course we invented this system on the principle of trial , error and correction . It was for this reason that , at his very first press conference , when NRA publicity began , the writer made his prophecy about dead cats . That required no foresight . The Keystone of NRA I must cull attention here to another fundamental of NBA . In view of an uninterrupted course of Supreme Court decisions , we did not believe anybody could write the labor provisions of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ penalties . Like the Draft Act , the whole law is written to depend on popular support rather than on statutory compulsion . That is the very basis of NIRA and NRA . It is what is being forgotten today . It must not be forgotten unless NRA is to fail . Those provisions can no more be constitutionally included in this Act now than they could then , and even if they could , they would be even more futile ROW than then . Another thing  --  Code snaking is one process . Code administration is a very different process . We had many hundreds of Codes to make . It would require about the same size of organization to administer all the Codes as it had taken to make all the Codes , Should we hire and train two organizations ? Or should we leave the early Codes largely to development by the industries under only very general cooperation , while we completed Code snaking , and then turn the whole trained and informed organization over to Code administration ? I deliberately chose the latter course . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the place for training was in Code making . Otherwise , I would have had to double the organization for a few months , half-manned with tyros , and then fire half of them . The course I took involved a hiatus in effective Code administration . Much criticism attended this choice , but I still believe it was the right choice . If I had it to plan and do all over again , after a unique public experience of thrice helping to organize this whole nation for the universal application of a somewhat sacrificial public statute  --  once with the Selective Draft in 1917 , once with the mobilization of industry on the War Industries Board in 1918 and once with NRA in 1933 ? if I had it to plan and do again , I would not know how to do it otherwise . No one has even suggested to me a better or even a different way . The Birth of a Bill About this time I learned for the first time that there were other bills in the mill , arising from various places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Commerce , and Jerome Frank , of Agriculture , had been working on one . Senator Wagner had another . To make a long story short , the President , who had had new drafts of our page-and-a-half Bill submitted to him almost daily by Lew Douglas , got everybody together and told us to lock ourselves up in a room and come out with an agreed Bill . We met in Lew Douglas ' office  --  Lew , Senator Wagner , John Dickinson , Mr. Richberg and myself , with a few burners-in from time to time . Without difficulty  --  or at least much difficul tyalbeit some slight misunderstandings at the offset , which were resolved by Rex Tugwell , we came out in a few days with a document on which we cotdd all agree , but alas for the pageand-a-half Bill . It was now as long as the moral law . Now came the suspense and anxiety of nursing the Bill through Congress . Eddie McGrady did most of that , although I stayed at the Capitol all of the time . I doubt if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called the turn on every vote on every amendment and , as I recall , he missed accuracy only once , and then only by one vote . During that period Huey Long made a typical attack on B. M. in the Senate , with a few digs at me . A reporter introduced us in the gallery , and he asked what I thought of it . All right. , " I said , " only I could have done it better . Go on , Huey . I speak your language . " Bob Wagner extended himself in preparation of this Bill , sponsored it in the Senate , and it bears his name . He has done more in intelligent labor legislation than any statesman of recent years . He afterward served as Chairman of the National Labor Board and did a pioneering job . After the President asked me to take over administration and before deciding on the exact and final form of the Bill , it was necessary to learn something about its possible reception . B. M. arranged for me a meeting in Now York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felix Frankfurter and Leo Wolman . We wont over the fundamentals of this whole plan and were in general agreement . It was my intention to keep a close and friendly co-operation between labor and industrial leaders at all times . We started well . As I shall later show , that continued for several weeks . I asked Leo Wolmun to come with me . I had known him during the war 86 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST January 26 , 19321 and seen his work , which was and has continuously been excellent . No man ever had a more faithful and courageous associate . I told William Green , of the Federation , that I wanted a personal assistant from the Federation who would remain constantly at my side . The Federation named Eddie McCrady , who had been their legislative representative . No greater stroke of luck happened to me . He became a bosom friend , a wise counselor , an aide whose loyalty knows no bounds . Wolman is a scientific type whose mind goes straight to essentials . He sees the main objective and is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He is absolutely fearless . So is MeGrady  --  and as independent as a hog on ice . He knows politics as well as any man in Washington and practices it up to a. point where it begins to interfere with frankness and fairness . He is as loyal as the Iron Brigade , and I would rather have him contacting Congress for a great department than any man I know . When intramural planning against NRA began a year later , the first move was to get and keep MeGrady out of town and , for the object in view , that was a very sagacious move . How Industry Reacted The Chamber of Commerce of the United States was in session . I went back to Washington and into conference with about thirty of our most important industrialists , who had come for that meeting . They did not like some things about the plan , but in view of the fact that their president had not long before suggested the dictatorship idea , their criticism was not exactly carping . Most of them approved and some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is now being said that NRA is practicing a new policy of consulting Industry and obtaining Industrial assistance . I think NRA invented that policy before there was any NRA . What NRA did not invent was chameleon changes and surrender to particular advisory groups . I did one other thing which now seems to be significant . I asked B. M. to call together a few of the very Brahmans of big industry , and we asked them for a showdown as to whether they were going to support or oppose this plan and whether they would come in with proposed Codes immediately upon passage of the law . We wanted to start off with such leadership for its effect on industry . One or two were skeptical , but most of them agreed . Most who agreed played ball . One or two did not . More important still , we asked them if they would recruit and get for me the very best material in industry to man the new enterprises . Several agreed . But , with some outstanding exceptions , that part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twentieth that the experiment depended on such men , and we fully counted on them . But war is one thing and the depths of a depression are another thing . We did not get enough of the type of men which was necessary to success , and that was and still is the greatest handicap to NRA . As I have already related , we set up skeletons of two organizations  --  one for Title I and the other for Title II . And we had developed outline plans for each . For NRA I started with an Assistant for Industry , Mr. Dudley Cates ; an Assistant for Labor , Eddie McCrady ; and an Administrative Assistant , Miss Frances Robinson , now known from one end of this country to the other as " Robbie " ? whom I regard as one of the two most efficient women I have seen in business or Government . The other is Miss Mary Boyle , who presides at B. M. Baruch 's office . For Title II , I had Col. George Spalding , whom I have already mentioned ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the general plan for weeks ; Col. Henry M. Waite , who actually carried on tinder Mr. Ickes ; Bob Kohn , H. H. Hunt , C. G. Kilbourne , Colonel Fleming , several other Regular Army engineers , and a score of civilian engineers whose names I , unfortunately , do not recall . I had been working for weeks on the Cotton Textile Code , to have it ready as soon as the law passed . Similar preliminary work had been done in Codes for steel , bituminous coal and automobiles . The skeleton preliminary organizations under both titles were working night and day , because we thought that time was of the very essence of our task if we were to relieve unemployment before winter set in . In the meantime , certain employers ' associations began to contest the labor provisions of the Act . They held a great convention of protest in Washington . They asked me to address them , to explain certain parts of the Act , and then hurriedly passed a resolution condemning them before they had heard my explanation . The effect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Act off in an atmosphere of bitterness and hostility between management and labor  --  a result that I had done my level best to avoid , and thought I had avoided by preliminary joint conference of leaders on both sides . It was very unfortunate and it hurt NRA tremendously . I then believed , and I still believe , that by quiet conferences we could have got the great industrial and labor leaders into a relationship of friendly joint action which the law specifically asks for , to the avoidance of much of the trouble we have suffered . I believe this for two reasons : The first is the truly broad and co-operative spirit of the really big men on both sides , and the second is that I went far enough in feelers toward leading men in labor and industry to convince me that satisfactory compositions could be made . The plan now seems to be to serve industry and exclude labor . That wo n't work . Called to the Colors During about two-thirds of the time just discussed , I had no intention or intimation that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either title of the Recovery Act . I did n't want to . I had a very clear vision of exactly what it would do to me , and I wanted to go back with B. M. and try to recoup something of my shattered fortunes , which was a clear possibility in the spring and summer of 1933 . I was only trying to do everything in my power to carry out Bernie 's instructions to do all I could for the President and then come home and go back to work with him . From April until the passage of the Bill I had been putting in between sixteen and eighteen hours a day on this job and I was frequently tired and sometimes disgusted . One day while I was going over a chart of the proposed organization for both titles with the President , he said : " Hugh , you 've got to do this job . " ( Continued on Page 88 ) THE SATURDAY ( Continued from Page , 86/ Cont rary to gossip , he did n't consult B. M. , and B. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hod other plans for me . My heart sank , but I knew exactly what Bernie would tell me to do . Furthermore , for my own part , I thought. , and still think , the President is in the toughest and most responsible job in our history . There is nothing that he could ask me to do which , consistent with self-respect and administrative possibility , I could do that I would n't do . I told him promptly that I would and , further , that I would be loyal to him and nobody else in doing it . Red Fire and Dead Cats There was a curious thing about that . I had no more than returned to my hotel when an Associated Press reporter named Jim Selvage came to me , saying that he knew I had been selected . I had not spoken a word to a soul in Washington . I have since learned that I talked too loud over the telephone asking somebody to come down and help me , and this smart reporter had put two and two together to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did I spurned the congratulations of my friends with the remark which was , fortunately , recorded : " It will be red fire at first and dead cats afterward . This is just like mounting the guillotine on the infinitesimal gamble that the ax wo n't work . " There was no question about this . There are three conflicting interests in NRA  --  management , labor and consumers . You ca n't fully please atty . You can only try to be fair to all while denying to each the full of its demands . When you try to do this in an atmosphere of sniping , reaching for power and intramural intrigue , you have assumed an almost impossible job . Of course the alternative is to enforce one cause and suppress the other . You can concentrate your dead cats on one flank and get the support of those to whom you have knuckled , but that is a cowardly and faithless course for a public servant . Nevertheless , we redoubled our efforts on all plans . One evening when I had a date to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to my surprise , most of the Cabinet seated around his desk . Except for the President , there was that about the atmosphere which did not seem particularly friendly . Standing alone in that silent semicircle , I felt like one accused before the Masked Court of the Venetian Doge . The President approved the chart in general , except that I had a division reporting to him and marked " Labor Policies Board . " He asked me about this , and I reminded him that , during the war , we had found an absolute necessity to have such a board of the very highest standing , of which ex-President Taft was chairman , to take out of the hands of the war administrations the formulation of labor policies and the settlement of labor disputes , and place them in a purely neutral forum . I observed that while , on the one hand , the formulation of the Codes , by terms of the statute , was in the hands of industry , and that this might prejudice labor , on the other hand , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the cause of labor , with a result that , if that Department were to act as arbitrator , management would regard itself as being forced before a partial judge and EVENING POST would never co-operate . There was no further discussion , but we dropped that board . At my suggestion , some months later , the National Labor Board was created and , also at my suggestion , Senator Wagner was appointed its Chief . It was set up independently and not in connection with the Department of Labor . There was one serious fault with it . It had a neutral chairman and equal membership for labor and industry . All should have been neutral . A divided board throws the casting vote to the chairman on all vital issues . You might just as well have one man . You do n't get the benefit of a deliberative body . Nothing more was said to me by the President until the Act was signed . The President was rushing to get ready to go on his vacation . Just before he went , I was called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all t5he members of the Cabinet present . I thought one or two of them had the expression of the cat which has just swallowed a canary . I was told  --  contrary to my previous understanding  --  that I was to report not to the President but a Cabinet Board , who were to control NRA ; that the administration of Title II  --  Public Works  --  was to be divorced from that of Title I and put under another and different Cabinet Board ; and that the acting chief of the temporary and tentative organization which had been working on Title II was to be supplanted , for some reason which I do not know . I was taken aback because I thought it indicated some vast change and a disturbing lack of confidence . But far from being disappointed , I was immensely relieved , because it seemed to me that there was only one course open to me . I thought that I should not undertake this unprecedented job in such circumstance and atmosphere . The Right Time to Quit Furthermore , I felt that , from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we had drawn it  --  was impossible . ' Unless Title I and Title II could move abreast in perfect co-ordination , the whole economic basis of the plan as we had proffered it was changed . As it turned out , these two efforts did not even move in contact . Mechanization of the Army did not follow . House repair and renewal were not started . Railroad re-equipment and grade-crossing elimination languished . That and the industrial-agrarian " ag-ronomes " are just now being seriously discussed  --  eighteen months after authority was given to do this thing . Public works moved at such a tempo that CWA was invented to get any considerable money into employment during the winter . I want to make it very emphatic that I say none of these things in criticism or complaint . The considerations which governed action were doubtless compelling . I am not in a position to judge , because I do not know the problems which others had to meet . I record these facts because they are indispensable to any just appraisal of the accomplishments and shortcomings of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have both a right and a duty to state them , because NRA is a public consideration transcending any private concern . But it is a little painful to reflect that our housing plan was submerged and now to see it dragged out as a brilliant discovery and the sole hope of succor. jan.nry 26,1935 When I had recovered from this surpriseI made oneor two suggestions in the wording of the order , made some notes to change the phrasing of a speech that I had prepared , and started back to my office with my mind fully made up as to what I must do . I was intercepted by Madam Secretary of Labor , who apparently saw in my face what I intended . She asked me , and I told her frankly that I was going to resign right then , not from pique but because I felt that a situation had been created that completely changed what I had undertaken to do . She asked me to get in her car and , while we drove slowly around , she pointed out to me that what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the President 's vacation ; said that I had an absolute duty to stay at least until his return ; conjectured that , perhaps , some coordination could be worked out ; observed that there was an immense social service to be required any way ; and was generally so understanding , friendly , kindly and persuasive that there was hardly a choice but to agree with her , and  --  as it has turned out  --  very fatuously , I did . When a man ca n't subscribe to a plan of action for which he is asked to accept responsibility , he has no business to undertake any part of it  --  no matter what the contrary considerations may be . The Three Conflicting Interests The thing I dreaded most was facing Alex Sachs , with whom I had planned so carefully . I did not see him for a day or two , and his reaction was what I had expected  --  that whatever of social good might be done , recovery was unlikely unless , under some co-ordination of NRA and PWA , the program could still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Interior that we had prepared plans which I would be glad to discuss with him , but I never received any further word from him . That was all right and above reproach . He had his own responsibilities and I had mine . If there was any co-ordination to do , it was neither my responsibility nor his . My job was to mind my own business and let other people 's business alone . Before I knew it I was caught in the maelstrom of my own job , and that was that . I had made my first great blunder by not stopping before I started . For this there is nobody to blame but myself , and I am complaining not at all and criticize nobody but Myself . As I have said , my whole theory of administration was to make NRA a forum of controversy . Nothing short of clairvoyance can prevision the effect of a Code ; first , because the whole idea is unprecedented ; second , because no group of men could be gathered who could know enough about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closet on its problems . The only way to get the truth in such a case is to give every adversary and informed interest its day in court . A third reason was because the Codes , like all law , are necessarily compromises , and you do n't got compromises in a dictatorial decree . In getting representatives of the three conflicting interests  --  management , labor and consumers  --  I wanted appointment to be wholly independent of myself , so I asked the Secretary of Commerce to appoint the Industrial Advisory'Board ; the Secretary of Labor to appoint the Labor Advisory Board , and appointed the Consumer 's Advisory Board after consultation with both sides . An important function of the task was that of General Counsel . I had worked so closely with Mr. Richberg , our minds seemed to run in such complementary channels , and I so much wanted at all times to preserve the Labor point of view with which I felt sure he was familiar , that I asked him to continue with me as General Counsel . He was practically unknown , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of exactly what this would bring down on me from practically the whole of industry , from the press , and from other large popular and political sectors  --  a charge that I had delivered NRA , at the very offset , into the hands of the Labor side of the argument . But I made up my mind that if I knew such charges not to be true , that if a man were qualified , as I thought he was , were as loyal as I believed him to be , and were devoted to the principles of this Act , as I thought he was , then I would have to make my choice on those considerations and stand loyally by it , in spite of all attacks on him or it , and , if there were any consequences , to take them  --  which I did and am still doing . A Shower of Criticism Just what I expected happened . Industrial protests rained on me from all sides and even some labor men of the Federation protested . At that time Mr. Richberg stepped into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me on his account than for any other reason . I told those of the conservative critics whom I knew exactly what I have said here and insisted that I was responsible for NRA , including its General Counsel . At any rate we did not retreat before that first baptism of criticism . It was also asserted that I had appointed too many Jews to important posts , and Mr. Richberg was cited against me on that score too . Just for the sake of the record , Mr. Richberg is not a Jew . If he had been , it would have made no difference to me . I tried to get the best staff I could persuade to serve , and I did not stop to inquire about whether they were Jews or Gentiles . I had several able Jews , but they were a very scant minority and every single one of them did an outstanding job . Not one was either disloyal or self-seeking . Eddie McGrady was my assistant for labor and , after his appointment as Assistant Secretary of Labor , I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me -- an understanding fulfilled until a few months ago , when , with no word to me , he was detached in circumstances elsewhere related , and he never returned to NRA . NRA Personnel ? My first assistant for industry was an old friend and associate of mine  --  Dudley Cates  --  formerly of a most liberal mental background , but , as appeared after a few weeks , he had developed firm and sincere convictions which were not consistent with the meaning of the Recovery Act as I interpreted it . He has one of the best minds I know and lie is conscientious almost to a fault , honest and fearless . When he , too , came to the conclusion that our interpretations did not agree , he resigned . Our friendship remains unimpaired as fa r as I am concerned . He acted as any true man should net . When you ca n't agree with a decided policy the only course is the course he took . It was the first time in my rather varied career that I over lost ? an associate through disagreement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Indeed , its eventual success will depend on them . In addition to that , the nature of this job requires some person of ability and familiarity with all its complexities to be always in the office . That person must be one in whom absolute confidence can be reposed , who shall be a witness to all conversations , and record such as seem vital . I had seen something of Miss Frances Robinson during the campaign when she worked as a volunteer at Democratic headquarters . She was recommended to me as having held and excelled in a responsible executive position in R. C. A. , and I decided to give her a trial during our preparatory period . Her performance was astonishing . I learned a lesson during the warbitterly  --  and as a result , never had a conversation without an alert and expert secretary in the room , who proceeded , unobtrusively , to take shorthand notes whenever the talk seemed to become critical . These notes were carefully preserved and were only transcribed in ease an issue arose . This precaution once saved the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unpleasant situation  --  but that . is another story . I continued it during my entire service in NRA  --  a fact that may be of some interest to various people . On the first schedule of appointments for which I secured approval , I named Miss Robinson as assistant to the Administrator at a Deputy 's salary . The Bituminous Coal Code The petty jealousies arising out of this and the innuendo and slurs that have attended it are probably too well known to require comment or characterization . She rapidly grasped every detail of the Act . She served as liaison with the White House , where she proved acceptable and welcome . She checked and kept all original copies of Codes . She handled the numerous calls and requests of members of Congress so much to their satisfaction that many of them never even tried to see me . She managed my colossal correspondence in such a way as to give me an almost complete escape from the bulk of it . She worked longer hours than I did , and that meant more than sixteen hours a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , and for certain periods much longer than that . We moved into execution the very moment the Act was passed . The Cotton Textile Code was well along , but the lost sheep for which our hearts yearned was the Bituminous Coal Code . To most of us , bituminous coal , though millions are dependent upon it for a living and though its fate indirectly affects business everywhere , seems unimportant . I doubt if one person out of a hundred not connected with the industry has ever even bothered to read its Code . Yet exciting drama could he written out of the strain and struggle and conflict which went into the making of that Code . And since this Code contained almost every kind of problem that we had to meet elsewhere , it may ( Continood on Page 911 ( Confinuird from Pate law be worth while to touch on its human background . In the spring of 1933 the entire industry was moribund . Almost every economic force that touches it had conspired to ruin it . The coal fields have been the dark @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , undersold , unable to pay even starvation wages , the most sinister clouds on our industrial horizon lowered there . Well , some days prior to the passage of the Act , the writer , with Divisional Administrator Kenneth M. Simpson  --  who was to assist on coal  --  attended a meeting of representatives of all the warring districts . It began early in the evening and it lasted until 2:30 in the morning and , in all our experience with 400 approved Codes , never has anything seemed so.hopeless as that . The Hard Problem of Soft Coal George Harrington and D. W. Buchanan , of the Illinois field , Fred Taplin , a scrappy independent , Charlie O'Neill , J. D. Francis and John Morrow , with a dozen others of the Appalachian field  --  I shall not try to name all of them  --  were the very chieftains of these despairing legions . In the background at that time were John Lewis , Phil Murray , Van Bitner and Henry Warren , leaders of the labor organization of the United Mine Workers . There were , on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They recognized the hopelessness of their condition , but there was too much bitter history in the background for them even to confer . They frankly said there was no hope of composition on any national plan . All these men later became leaders of the NRA van  --  but then I never left a meeting with a heavier heart . The Textile Code was coming along , but the steel industry was increasingly coy  --  developments in the motor industry were not encouraging , and from the beginning of the NRA movement to this good day , there was no more discouraging period . There seemed to be only one chance on coal . These leaders thought , from decades of experience , that they could never herd their people into one corn-pact . Our answer was : " You never had the same circumstances before . Under the old law , your very efforts to this end were unlawful , if not criminal . You never had such a leader as Roosevelt . You never had a whole people demanding such action . You neverhad a situation so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There are old bitter memories to be overcome . There is a diversity of purpose and aim which nobody outside the industry can understand . Yet , if you think you can sell the proposal to the operators themselves , they will be in national convention in Chicago when the Act is signed . If you want to risk it , you can come there and try . " With more desperation than assurance , we accepted this challenge . The National Industrial Recovery Act was signed on June sixteenth . That was the last day of the coal convention . But the Army offered to furnish an airplane , which , by a close shave , could make the distance within the time . No speech was prepared and the early part of the day was taken up with hurried arrangements at the White House and the bitter disappointment which I have already recorded  --  the last-minute shift of the whole Public Works program from any contact or cohesion with NRA . We could not leave the flying field until after three in the afternoon . The plane got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with the aid of a miniature staff , we began at once , on the plane , to try to prepare a presentation to the convention . It was a task so engrossing that nobody even looked out the window for an hour . When I did look my hair rose on end . Wet wisps of mist were floating and waving by like washing on a clothesline on a windy day . Just as I raised my eyes , one of those ethereal union suits flapped its legs up and disclosed that we were headed into a mountain not a hundred yards away , with no sight of its top and no idea of what lay on left , right , or bottom . Like the amorous couple is the Divine Comedy , we " read ( nor wrote ) no more that day . " We were off the radio beam . We were lost in the mist . We had not enough gasoline to dare to climb over the fog and we fumbled around those mountains for an hour and a half . When we should have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , and precariously threaded our way up the valley of the flood  --  which seemed about as wide as a notch in a rifle sight  --  with a fluffy ceiling forcing us so low that we could almost spit on the wet automobile tops on the road below , and the wing tips seeming nearly to touch on either side . Losing the First Round We made an almost horizontal landing in the mesa of the Pittsburgh port  --  no speech  --  Chicago out of the question , and in the pious suppression of men who fur an hour or two had been trying to remember whether " Now I lay me " comes just before or just after " Forgive us our trespasses . " In that state of perturbation and , in the foolhardiness of a first appearance , I remarked that it had been a hell of a day , and rushed to a Pittsburgh radio station and attempted an extemporaneous but impassioned plea to that disrupted Chicago convention . It was a sorry beginning . It was a flop . There was nothing to do but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , day after day , week after week  --  in an effort , by persuasion , sometimes by bluffing , principally by plain horse trading and bare-faced poker playing , by which most of the early great Industrial Codes finally came into being . In a recent article in a magazine it was said that we faltered and that Secretary Perkins drove us on , that we faltered again and that . a coal strike drove us on . We never faltered , and Madam Secretary had nothing whatever to do with it . It was also said in that article , and another in the Chicago Tribune , that I received a defiant letter from the operators in a restaurant , cursed and tore it to bits . No such thing ever happened , any more than the equally blatant fabrication that I ever commanded a business man to remain and negotiate , or threatened to crack down on Henry Ford . These are libels from which a man in public life in such a situation has no protection . The Cotton Textile hearings were scheduled for June twenty-seventh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of coal , and there was nothing to do but plunge into both of these situations at once , leaving the coal situation to simmer awhile . High Mark in Economic History The Cotton Textile Code will always be a high mark in the economic history of our country , first because the cooperative attitude of the industry showed the way and set the tempo for the execution of the entire Recovery Act and , second , because this industry led the way for all industry in the abolition of child labor  --  something done here in half an hour that it had taken England eighty years to do , and that we , by statute and proposed constitutional amendment , had failed to do after forty years of effort . In view of the many criticisms of what has or has not been done , I shall , to the end of my days , take comfort in this trail breaking . There was nothing said in the law about how these Codes were to be made  --  what the organization , or the approach to the problem should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what the goal or where the path thereto . Administration could have been purely negative  --  a passive attitude of waiting for a move from management . It would never have come . Or we could have moved in to hale the industries before us and , on some preconceived idea of what they ought to do , we could have cracked the whip and told them what they must do  --  licensing all companies in interstate commerce and installing a Federal economic dictatorship . It would not have lasted sixty days . Any other thing might have happened . I do not know . I only know what did happen . We brought the whole of American industry voluntarily in under the Industrial Recovery Act and we did it  --  by the P. R. A. ? in four months . Let the " heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing " ? nobody can ever take that accomplishment away from NRA , and to attack that vast reform of national extent and universal benefit because it is alleged that there were some faults in its execution is like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave vent to her demented laughter , left the nest and joined her mate . Clamping the tiger snake behind the head with her powerful beak while her mate seized the serpent 's middle section , she helped to stretch the common prey until life had departed from it . The tiger snake had given birth to more than twenty young , each smaller than a pencil . Hovering aloft , thekeen-eyed birds watched every tiny movement on the earth below ; and before the day was out , all but a very few of this poisonous family had disappeared down their capacious maws.
