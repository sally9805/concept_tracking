txt Warning Against Cat Traps . To the Editor of The New York Times : The Humane Society of New York wishes to warn against trapping dogs and cats . This is being extensively done with the intention of rescuing these animals from misery , but it is causing the disappearance of many pets throughout the city . It also leads to trapping by thoughtless children and other people with less kind intentions . There are several societies which , if called upon , . will collect stray animals . We ask all humane societies to join in requesting their members to gi " e up the practice of trapping . We also ask people to help end this cruelty by giving unwanted animals to humane societies instead of turning them out on the streets while they themselves leave town for pleasure trips . Call the Humane Society of New York , Chelsea 3-5635 , if you see any trap . All information will be confidential . MARY L. TUCKERMAN . Vice President . New York , April 28 , 1933.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
