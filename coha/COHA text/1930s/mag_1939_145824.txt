A new chapter was last week tagged on to the saga of Harold E. Dahl , the U. S. aviator who fell into Rebel hands while fighting as a mercenary for the Loyalist Air Force in July 1937 . Ambassador Claude Bowers , back from Spain for good , said that the famous letter Harold Dahl 's pretty wife , Edith , wrote to Francisco Franco , enclosing an interesting picture of herself and begging clemency for her husband , never reached the very married Generalissimo . His staff officers handed the picture around and " passed judgment . " according to the New York Daily News , " on this and that . " Then they wrote her , over General Franco 's signature , the likewise famous reply promising mercy and ending : Your obedient servant kisses your foot . <P> After a spectacular trial for " rebellion " again.t Franco 's regime , Aviator Dahl was sentenced to death , immediately reprieved . <P> From then on , reported Ambassador Bowers , the Rebels ' problem was not how to keep him in jail but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freedom of Salamanca , but kept getting into trouble because of red wine rather than Red ideology . The city just could not get rid of him . Once , just before he was to be exchanged back to the Loyalists , he announced publicly : " I do n't give a damn about a cause . I 'm fighting for money . " The Loyalists took someone else . And ever since , Harold E. Dahl has been Peck 's Bad Boy in Salamanca . Reason why he stays where he is definitely unwanted : he is even more definitely wanted in Los Angeles on charges of having passed eight bad checks .
