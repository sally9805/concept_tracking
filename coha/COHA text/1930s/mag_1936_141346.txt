When , in 1927 , RCA evolved a new radio tube which needed no storage battery , Philadelphia Storage Battery Co . ( Philco ) , faced with disaster , decided to make radios itself . Under earnest President James M. Skinner , Philco. in 1934 , was making twice as many radios as RCA , annually accounting for 1,250,000 sets or 30% of all U. S. sales . <P> Last month hundreds of Philco employes marched across the Delaware River from Philadelphia into Camden , N. J. , helped RCA employes win a six-week strike for more pay ( TIME . July 27 ) . Due in no small measure to the costs of the Camden rumpus , the earnings of RCA dropped some $200,000 below comparable 1935 figures in the second quarter of 1936 . <P> Last week Philco and RCA tangled once more , this time in New York 's Supreme Court . Charging that RCAgents had secretly wined &; dined young Philco female employes , involving them in " compromising situations to induce them to furnish confidential information , documents and designs , irate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ devious methods of trade rivalry . Philco demanded the return of allegedly stolen secrets a settlement for " substantial expense and damage in endeavoring to protect its business and property from RCA depredations . <P> Unable to name the weak and treacherous employes RCA is supposed to have seduced , and unwilling to specify what secrets had been purloined , Philco nevertheless wailed : " - It has required the great-skill , invention , vigilance and effort successfully to develop and maintain such a business in the face of its highly competitive nature ... and particularly the competition of RCA ... by reason of its financial power and patent monopoly " By underhanded acts , complained Philco , RCA " is seeking further to extend and strengthen its domination and control of said industry . " <P> In Manhattan , through Vice President &; General Counsel Manton Davis , RCA declared that there was " no foundation whatsoever for the charges , denied them in toto.
