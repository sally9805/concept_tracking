&gt; In Manhattan last fortnight , an even dozen of the cinema industry 's top line executives , representing all of Hollywood 's eight major producing companies , gathered in the office of Tsar Will Hays for the most impressive powwow of cinema bigwigs in a decade . Present were : Barney Balaban ( Paramount ) , Nate J. Blumberg ( Universal ) , Harry Cohn , Jack Cohn ( Columbia ) , Samuel Goldwyn , Maurice Silverstone ( United Artists ) , Nicholas M. Schenck ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) , Sidney R. Kent , Joseph M. Schenck ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) , Leo Spitz ( RKO Radio ) , Albert Warner , Harry M. Warner ( Warner Bros . ) , Will H. Hays . <P> Since Hollywood 's eight major producing companies had only until November 1 to answer the U. S. Department of Justice indictment for monopolistic practices , ostensible purpose of the meeting was to discuss ways and means of meeting this and other major crises , such as restrictions on cinema distribution in Italy and Germany , labor troubles on the West Coast , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Actually , word leaked from Hollywood that the real purpose of the meeting was something else entirely : to consider ways and means of checking anti-Semitism in so far as it affects movie revenues . <P> Cinema producers , as a class , rightly or wrongly have the reputation of being uncultured , brash and boorish . On the theory that this reputation is a liability , the producers agreed that one means of combatting anti-Semitism would be to render themselves less vulnerable to unfavorable publicity , by abstaining from caf society , ostentatious gambling for large stakes , misconduct with " Aryan " actresses . When cinema morals were under fire in 1922 , the Hays Organization was given the job of raising the standards of personal behavior among cinema performers . Confronted with the problem of their own behavior , producers proposed to establish an organization along somewhat similar lines , for which Chicago Adman Albert Davis Lasker was proposed as unpaid head , to help cinemagnates guide and regulate their private lives . <P> &gt;In Hollywood Producer Walt Disney announced that he had bought the screen rights to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stockwell , who sang the roles respectively of Snow White and Prince Charming , in Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs , were suing him for $300,000 , as their share of the profits from the sale of phonograph records . <P> &gt;Elected president of RKO to succeed retiring Lawyer Leo Spitz was bulky , greying , onetime film salesman , George Joseph Schaefer , now distribution head of United Artists . First Schaefer job at RKO : steering the bankrupt company through a reorganization plan which the U. S. District Court is expected to approve this week . <P> &gt; In Jefferson City , Mo . Attorney General Roy McKittrick ruled that the famed MPAYBE " Movie Quiz " was a lottery , advised Missouri theatre owners who wished to avoid the chance of going to prison for from two to five years to avoid participating in it .
