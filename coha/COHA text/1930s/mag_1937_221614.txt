In Moscow one night last week crowds bustled to a theatre to see a new play by one Michail V. Vodopyanov . It was called The Dream and it dealt with a flight to the North Pole . About the same moment Playwright Vodopyanov was actually at the controls of a big monoplane which was actually over the North Pole . <P> This coincidence was just one detail of a minutely calculated plan on which Russian scientists and aviators have been working for years and which last week came off with perfect precision under the direction of Russia 's No. 1 non-political hero , jolly , bushy-bearded Dr. Otto Tulyevitch Schmidt . A 46-year-old chemist and meteorologist , who looks like the late U. S. coughdrop-making brothers of the same name , Dr. Schmidt was the first man to navigate the " northwest passage " from Archangel to Vladivostok in one year . He has been responsible more than anybody else for the Soviet 's great development of this icebound route , over which some 160 freighters now ply each summer . Dr. Schmidt 's greatest fame came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and 101 men , women , and children , 150 miles north of Bering Straits . He set up housekeeping on an ice-floe , kept everyone alive &; healthy for two months until a fleet of airplanes rescued them all ( TIME , Feb. 26 &; April 23 , 1934 ) . Since then , Dr. Schmidt has been planning a feat dwarfing anything he has ever done before-to establish a permanent base at the North Pole , run an airline over it from Moscow to San Francisco . <P> Last March , with all plans in order and complete equipment on hand , Dr. Schmidt led a flight of four four-motored ANT6 monoplanes from Archangel across the Arctic Ocean to bleak Rudolf Island in frigid Franz Josef Land . On May 5 one plane piloted by Pavel Golovin flew to the Pole and back without landing . Last week Dr. Schmidt himself took off , headed straight up over the bald , glittering dome of the globe toward the Pole . With him went Pilots Vodopyanov , I. T. Spirin , M. S. Babushkin and Mechanic F. I. Bassein . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the flying , covered the 560 miles to the Pole in six hours . Circling a few times , he picked a smooth floe 15 miles beyond , put his big plane down in a perfect landing . Climbing out and setting up a radio station , Dr. Schmidt wirelessed Moscow , 2,390 mi. away : " We feel that by interruption of communication we have inadvertently caused you alarm . We are very sorry . Hearty greetings . Please report to the Party and the Government the fulfillment of the first part of our task . " <P> While Russia went crazy with joy and officially laid claim to the Pole. * Dr. Schmidt and friends set to like polar beavers . Next morning he reported : " Everything is in good order . . . . The first weather report was sent to Moscow according to schedule . The weather is comparatively warm-10.4 Fahrenheit . The sun is shining and a light wind is drifting the surface-snow . Everyone enjoyed a good sleep in the warm sleeping bags . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
