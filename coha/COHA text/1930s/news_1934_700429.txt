txt Day 's Money Developments . A return to the gold standard by Britain within two months was suggested in London financial circies as the next move in the international monetary situation . A rush of gold here from Europe , taxing shipping facilities , forced the dollar to a 6.6 per cent premium , while the franc went to a 6.20 discount and the pound dropped to $4.87 . Early discussions with Britain on a tie-up between the dollar and the pound for a test period were indicated in Washington . Gold rush from Paris starts with 63,000,000 francs on two steamships . Talk of embargo plan discounted . British Move Is Forecast . By CHARLES A. SELDEN . Wireless to Tue New Yogis Timms . LONDON , Feb. ** is suggested in financial quarters now that England herself may tentatively return to the gold standard in about two months as her next move to meet the situation created by America 's resumption of that standard . The suggestion of the two-months period is based on the fact that in about that time Neville Chamberlain , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Parliament , a logical occasion for the announcement of such a change of policy if it is to be made at all . It was in his budget speech in April , 1925 , that Winston Churchill , then Chancellor of the Exchequer , surprised the country by his announcement of England 's last return to gold . If Mr. Chamberlain should do it this coming April , it would be with reservations and safeguards which Mr. Churchill did not think necessary nine years ago . More Cautious Course Forecast . It is true that last Monday , when a member of the House of Commons asked if the government would consider reducing the gold content of the pound and establishing a new parity , the Treasury spokesman replied that " such a proposal would be inappropriate under the present circumstances . " But circumstances have changed materially . Two days later President Roosevelt proclaimed his 59.06 per cent dollar , reserving the right to change - the valuation If deemed necessary . A similar move on the part of England , with a similar reservation as a safeguard , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within narrow limits without the necessity of currency negotiations between the two countries . Moreover , present conditions in England conform to what cautious gold standard advocates , including the Bank of England , have stipulated all along should exist before a return to gold was attempted again . Their theory has been that after the unanchored pound had shown a reasonable stability over a period of several months , it would be safe once more to give it a fixed ratio to gold for at least a trial period . The unfixed pound has been re- ; markably stable for some time now , but what is wanted next is some more definite assurance that it will remain so with reference to the dollar . If both currencies were on gold , even with reservations , that result would be attained , at least approximately , and in the oi.inion of advocates of such a course , it would remove the danger of an Anglo-American exchange war , and be much more practical than trying to reach agreement by means of a conference , for which there could be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Churchill returned to gold nine years ago , he restored the old parity and left himself no avenue of retreat in case the experiment failed . Bankers and politicians who praised him at the time have been unanmious since then in saying that he made a great mistake . Mr. Chamberlain will not make the same mistakes . Mr. Churchill fixed the value of sterling in gold at 77s. 1014d. per ounce . Today 's price of gold in London rose to 139s. 6d. per ounce . In other words , the pound is worth in gold now only about half of what Mr. Churchill declared it should be worth in 1925 . If again it is anchored to gold it will be at some-where near its present value . Bank 's Gold Reserves Greater . The gold reserves of the Bank of England in 1925 were ? 153,000,000 . Today they amount to ? 190,000,000 . Neither the British Foreign Office nor the Treasury has yet received the slightest intimation from Washing-ton that the Washington government would like to have an AngloAmerican money conference . Commenting on the disturbing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the last decade , The London Nconornist says that the United States ' tariffs today are an even greater obstacle . " In the light of these difficulties , " it adds , " we fear that this country must be driven back to a hand-tomouth monetary policy . Three guiding principles , however , can be laid down . First , we must not by embarking on any rash experiment create difficulties either for the countries of the gold bloc or those who have been associating themselves with sterling . " Secondly , we must endeavor , so far as possible , to avoid being drawn into the use of our resources to combat the operations of the American Treasury . If we can not agree with Washington upon a fixed objective for the policy of both countries . our monetary authorities should at least attempt to avoid a conflict by the closest possible interchange of information . ' " Finally , we must persist in our policy of cheap money and endeavor by every possible means to broaden the basis of our economic recovery . Though we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for international cooperation , our line at the moment must be to take care of the pound and leave the dollar and the franc to take care of themselves . " Exchange Operations Doubted . The financial editor of The London Times writes : " Owing to the desire to convert sterling balances into dollar balances , the pound depreciated sharply in terms of dollars today , the New York rate failing from $4.97% to 41.9014 , this being very close to the lowest quotation of the day . " The demand for dollars arises from the repatriation of American balances sent to Europe during the period of currency uncertainty and nervousness , but it also is due to speculative purchases of American securities , which generally give a higher yield than can be obtained in this country . " Shipments of gold are being made by private institutions , mot by the American Government . Before the latest development the American authorities were in the habit of buying gold in the London market and in Paris against the sales of dollars , in pursuit of their policy of depreciating the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has discontinued this policy , #since it is no longer necessary , the initiative having now passed to private individuals on account of the profit to be , made by shipping gold to America . " There is at present no sign that the American exchange fund is being brought into operation for the purpose of buying francs and pounds to the point of eliminating the premium of the tiollar over the gold franc , which , so long as it remains , will induce gold shipments to the United States .
