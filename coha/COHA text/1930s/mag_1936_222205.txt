PATRIOTIC LADY-Marjorie Bowen-Appleton-Century ( $3 ) . <P> To the near-sighted eyes of posterity , historical figures are apt to loom larger and more beautiful than they do under the historian 's microscope . To every true-blue Briton , Horatio Nelson was one of England 's greatest heroes , and his beauteous Lady Hamilton the fitting Venus to his Mars . But not to the microscopic eye of Biographer Marjorie Bowen* whose tale is enough to turn a true-blue Briton purple or green , set Nelson himself whirling on his Trafalgar column . <P> Emma , Lady Hamilton did not start as a lady , and according to Biographer Bowen , achieved ladyhood only technically . Her real name was Amy Lyon ; her father was a blacksmith . Her profession , which she adopted in her teens , was " pleasing the gentlemen . " Sir Harry Featherstonehaugh kicked her out because she was too noisy and expensive ; the Hon. Charles Francis Greville got her cheap and did his skillful best to make a Galatea of her . He moderated her voice , calmed her taste @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike classical attitudes . When she was presentable he let her be seen . His friends all agreed she was something to look at . Artist Romney went wild over her , painted her in dozens of poses . After a few years , careful Mr. Greville handed her over to his uncle , Sir William Hamilton , who thereupon settled his nephew 's debts and made him his heir . <P> Sir William was Minister to the Court of Naples , and in that garish society Emma sparkled . Though she was years younger than her elderly lover , she transferred her fidelity to him without much trouble . In Naples they could live openly together without causing scandal . When they went home to London on a visit , Sir William surprised everybody by marrying her . Though she was still not received by English society , Lady Hamilton made quite a stir among the Neapolitans , and became great gossips with Bourbon Queen Maria Carolina , Marie Antoinette 's sister . Says Biographer Bowen : " The two women gossiped , lamented , condoled together , with freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virtues in common . " When Captain Horatio Nelson , on duty with the British Mediterranean Fleet , called at Naples , he was entertained at Sir William 's . Emma made an indelible impression on him . <P> The future lovers did not meet again until Nelson had lost an eye and an arm and won world-wide fame by demolishing the French fleet in Aboukir Bay . Then the Hero of the Nile led his fleet into the Bay of Naples , and there he stayed , in spite of the welcome ( and the patient wife ) awaiting him at home , in spite of hints and finally orders from his superior officers . When a French-abetted revolution broke out in Naples , Nelson transported the court and the Hamiltons to Sicily . When the revolution faded out he brought them back again , helped to exact such a treacherous and bloody vengeance that it nearly cost him his hero 's popularity in England . Meantime Nelson had become Emma 's lover ; Sir William either did not see or did not care . Finally the English Government , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nelson and Sir William .
