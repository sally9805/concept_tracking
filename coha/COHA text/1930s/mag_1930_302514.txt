A quiet dinner chez Thomas William Lamont last week appropriately closed the brief U. S. visit of the most famed living native-born South African . No blackamoor is General Rt . Hon. Jan Christiaan Smuts . Indeed he roused the ire of U. S. blackamoors by alluding to their African ancestors and relatives as " the most patient of all animals " ( TIME , Jan. 20 ) . But Europeans will not be angry at what Africa 's slim* Smuts said of Europe last week , just before he sailed on the Ile de France . Said he : <P> " There is an impression in America that Europe is decadent , on the down grade , because of the War . Let me assure you that Europe was never younger than today ! It is almost as if the forces of youth had been released anew in the Old World . <P> " Europe is freer , more democratic than before . It is a most curious aftereffect of the War : nobody would have expected it ! Class distinctions are going . The haremlike isolation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is dead , the New Europe not yet born . We are living in a time of transition . " <P> <P> *His Dutch nickname , " slim Jannie , " means " shrewd Jannie , " not " slender Jannie . "
