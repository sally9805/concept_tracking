If for any urgent reason a Rector or Minister ... or the Parish committed to his charge , its Vestry or Trustees , shall desire a separation and dissolution of the pastoral , relation , and the parties be not agreed . . . notice in writing may be given by either party to the Ecclesiastical Authority of the Diocese or Missionary District . The Bishop , in case the difference be not settled by his godly judgment , . . may ask the advice and consent of the Standing Committee of the Diocese . . . . - Canon 42 of the Protestant Episcopal Church . <P> In Seattle last week Superior Court Judge Howard M. Finley soberly heard churchmen expound the quality of a bishop 's " godly judgment . " Since the Episcopal Church drew up its constitution in 1789 , its Canon 42 had been brought into civil court only once before-in New Jersey in 1893 . Tortuous and hedged with ambiguities was the question Judge Finley was to decide : had Bishop Simeon Arthur Huston the right to oust Rev. Charles Stanley Mook from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his diocese ? <P> A husky , goateed churchman who once was a high-school football coach in North Dakota , 62-year-old Rector Mook had for ten years been at old Trinity Church in Seattle 's run-down " First Hill " district . A vigorous social worker , he offended some of his parishioners by encouraging theatrical folk to come to the church . More vexing to the Trinity vestry were financial troubles which had beset the church for four years . Last spring Rector Mook declined to let his salary be cut from $4,000 to $2,400 or to cancel $1,000 the church owed him in arrears . The vestry asked him to resign . When he declined , a vestry committee went to the bishop . Three weeks ago Bishop Huston , whose son Wilber was the first ' ' prodigy " given a Thomas A. Edison college scholarship ( TIME , Aug. 14 , 1929 ) , removed Rector Mook and appointed a successor . <P> Rector Mook obtained a court order temporarily restraining Bishop Huston from ousting him . Last week he was in court seeking to have the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rector knew that church money had been embezzled ; that he refused to prosecute . Furthermore it appeared that Rector Mook had discharged six choir singers , dissolved the Women 's Auxiliary and the Daughters of the King-all because the women opposed him . But of most concern to the court and the Episcopal Church were the opinions of five of Bishop Huston 's clergy . Unanimously they agreed that he had exceeded his canonical authority . Said Very Rev. John D. McLauchlan , dean of the Seattle Cathedral : " A bishop ca n't do anything without the consent of his Standing Committee . Personally I feel that bishops should have much more power than they do-but they do n't . " Dean McLauchlan and his colleagues agreed that a bishop 's right to exercise his " godly judgment " means his right to offer advice-not to assume independent judicial functions . They also felt that Canon 42 is ambiguous and should be revised at the triennial General Convention of the Church in Atlantic City next week .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
