In 1930 , hustling , industrial Waterbury , Conn , ( watches , chemicals , brass ) thought it was rid at last of a corrupt Democratic regime which had ridden it since 1921 . Into the mayor 's office marched a silver-haired bigboy named Thomas Frank Hayes , a Democrat of good family and much property who had made a name for himself in the Legislature . With him marched his friends Daniel J. Leary as comptroller and Thomas P. Kelly as executive secretary . They got a new " strong mayor " charter for the city instead of a city-manager plan , which had nearly been adopted . Taxes went up , relief necessitated a $2,000,000 bond issue , but the books of Mayor Hayes &; Co. looked fine . Mr. Hayes got elected Lieutenant Governor in 1934 but retained his mayoral job just the same . <P> By 1936 , Waterbury 's newspapers , the Republican and American , smelled large rats . They campaigned to have Hayes &; Co. ' s books examined closely . When Comptroller Leary failed ( by 33 votes ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replaced him soon found the rats : fat fees to favored contractors , inexplicable withdrawals from the city treasury , garbled records , false audits . <P> State 's Attorney Hugh Mead Alcorn , the man who helped send famed Murderer Gerald Chapman to the gallows , was called in . Hayes &; Co. were arraigned by a Grand Jury in 1938 on a blanket charge of conspiracy to loot Waterbury of better than $1,000,000 . Last week a jury of Connecticut laborers , farmers and housewives , after a trial that had lasted nearly eight months ( TIME , Dec. 26 ) , finally cogitated the conduct of Hayes &; Co . Eager crowds , including Cinemactress Rosalind Russell ( home from Hollywood on vacation ) , packed in and around the courtroom to hear the verdict : " Guilty . " Tears filled the hard eyes of Boss Hayes , 56 . " It was in the cards , " he gulped , but he strode out of court with his chin up . State 's Attorney Alcorn broke his 30-year precedent of not commenting on verdicts . Said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greater public service . " <P> Summoned back to court early this week , the convicted men heard their fate : Mayor Hayes ( who has not yet resigned ) and Friend Leary , ten to 15 years in jail ; for Aide Kelly , seven to twelve years .
