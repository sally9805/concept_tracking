most had , that day last spring when she had found his picture in the May copy of Town and Country ' in Muriel 's livingroom . But it had seemed absurd to break a silence of fifteen years ' duration just because she had seen a snapshot , from the camera of the Associated Press , of Andre , with averted head and raised silk hat , resplendent in bridal finery , hasteningthrough the classic portico of the Madeleine with a vision in floating tulle on his arm . A vision reported to be , in the legend beneath the snapshot , Mademoiselle Cyprienne Pyramel-Gramont , daughter of the Comte et Comtesse Jean Pyramel-Gramont . Noted Sculptor Weds ' had been the caption . Andre was a noted sculptor . One of France 's most distinguishedsons . Eight years ago , on the occasion of her memorabletrip abroad with Stephen , Jane had come suddenly on his Adam ' in the corridors of the Tate Gallery . Stephen had called her attention to it . He had noticed it because it was double-starred in Baedeker . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Later his Eve ' had met Jane 's eye with an enigmatic smile over her yet untasted apple , in the entrance of the Luxembourg . An Eve still innocent , but subtly provocative . Jane had regarded her with wistful interest . What had Andre said in the postscript of his long explanatory letter  --  Jane had never forgotten  --  There is something of you in all my nymphs and Eves and saints and Madonnas ? ' And what was Stephen sayingat the moment ? Golly , she smiles like you , Jane ! He never got over you ! ' Well , why should he ? ' she had retorted lightly . But her mind was still busy with the postscript . Something you brought into my life . Romance , I guess . Nothing more tangible . ' She had brought romance into Andre 's life , as they walkedp251up the Lake Shore Drive together , with their schoolbooks under their arms . He was achieving its fulfilment , now with this French Cyprienne , in exotic settings that Jane could not even imagine . Andre was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane , was a settled suburban housewifeand the middle-aged mother of a fourteen-year-old daughter and an eleven-year-old daughter and a nine-yearoldson . Jane felt devoutly grateful that the Atlantic rolled between them . That Andre would never see her again . That he would think of her , always , as she looked in a hair-ribbon , while Cyprienne had babies and grew old and came to look only like Cyprienne . But Cyprienne would n't grow so very old , thought Jane almost resentfully , while Andre lived to see her . Cyprienne , under the floating tulle , had n't looked a day over eighteen . Four years older than Cicily , perhaps , and bewitchinglypretty . Sixteen-year-old Andre , a middle-aged Frenchman with a child bride ! Jane shivered as she thought of it . Men should marry when they were young . Andre should have married when he loved her . But if he had he would never have become one of France 's most distinguished sons . Chicago would have stifled him . Andre might have been a banker by this time , thought Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he had had the sense to foresee it . His abrupt departure from her life had been much in the romantic tradition established by Romeo in the balcony window . His alternatives had been the same . I must be gone and live , or stay and die ! ' But she had married young . And Stephen had been young when she married him . They had had together those ridiculous , unthinking , heart-breaking years of almost adolescent domesticity , with two babies in the sand pile and another in the perambulator and a contagious disease sign often on the front door and a didy always on the clothesline ! They 'd had all that . But had they really had romance ? Romance , such as she 'd known with Andre ? Stephen had had it , perhaps , in the first years of their marriage . But  --  had she ? Had n't she always been rather afraid of romance , all those young years when it might have been hers for the taking ? Did a woman ever really value romance until she felt it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sign of all of being middleaged ? You might be still slim and agile and not grey , but when you felt that wistful , almost desperate impulse to live your life to the full before it was over , did n't it really mean that it was over , that youth , at any rate , was over , that it was too late to recapture the glamour that you saw only in retrospectBut this was ridiculous , thought Jane . Life was n't over at thirty-six . She loved Stephen and Stephen loved her . He had never looked at another woman . Anything they wanted was theirs for the taking . Their personal relationship was only what they made it . She must say to Stephen , Look at me , Stephen ! Really look at me ! You have n't for ten years ! ' And he would laugh  --  of course he always laughed at herThat was Stephen 's step on the stair . Jane looked quickly about the bedroom . Yes , it was very neat . Mrs. Carver was an excellent housekeeper and Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a chair by the dressing-table and the linen sheets of the twin four-poster mahogany beds were turned smoothly down over the rose-coloured comforters . Stephen 's clean blue pajamas were folded on his pillow . As he opened the door , Jane rose from her mirror to meet him . He stood a moment on the threshold , smiling contentedlyaround the lamplit room . Dear old Stephen  --  even in the soft light he still looked white and jaded . Jane walked slowly over to him . P253Glad to be here ? ' she smiled up into his eyes . You bet ! ' said Stephen fervently . I 'm glad you 've come , ' said Jane . Stephen closed the door . How 's it been ? ' said Stephen . Family been bothering you ? ' Oh , no , ' said Jane . Stephen slipped off his grey sack coat and hung it carefully over the back of a chair . It 's a pretty good old place , ' said Stephen . He walked over to the window in his shirt-sleeves and peered out into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Stephen . He snuffed the briny air luxuriously for a moment in silence . Put out the lamp , ' said Stephen . The moon 's just rising over the bay . ' Smiling a little , Jane pushed the button and walked blindly over to him in the darkness . She slipped her arm though his . The brown film of screen had grown suddenly transparent . The lawn and beach and harbour were flooded with silver light . The waning moon swung low in the eastern sky . Jane gazed in silence as small objects on the lawn slowly took form and substance in the unearthly radiance . The outcrops of granite rock cast clear-cut shadows on the greyish grass . The weather beaten outline of a clump of stunted cedars at the foot of the pier stood out in black silhouette against the silver waters of the harbour . The slender mast of the catboat rocked uneasilyat its moorings . A lighthouse winked , deliberately , far out in the bay . One white flash and two red . Jane could hear the little harbour waves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then the faint moaning of the bell-buoy that marked the hidden reef beyond the point . Jane pressed her cheek gently against Stephen 's arm.  | I 'm very glad you 've come , ' she said . Stephen turned his head abruptly . Her voice seemed to rouse him from revery . I guess it was time , ' he said cheerfully . Mother seems a bit on edge . ' Jane dropped his arm . She moved away from him in the square of moonlight that fell through the casement . What about ? ' she asked . Oh  --  nothing much , ' said Stephen still cheerfully . Then , after a moment , Do n't you think , Jane , you could persuade Miss Parrot to use the back stairs ? ' Jane moved in silence back to her dressing-table . She switched on the light abruptly and sat down on her chair . I 've said all I could , ' said Jane . You know how Miss Parrot is . She 's an awfully good heart nurse . I do n't want to rock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his collar in silence . He walked slowly across the room to place them on top of his chest of drawers . Jane watched him in her mirror . Suddenly she caught the gleam of irritation in her own eyes . She gazed steadily at her reflection until it faded into a twinkle of amusement . Stephen , ' she said resolutely , wheeling round in her chair , do n't talk about Miss Parrot . ' All right , ' said Stephen , I wo n't . ' He was unbuttoning his waistcoat a trifle absent-mindedly . How 's the weather been ? Good sailing breeze , all month ? ' As he spoke he turned to smile at her . Jane regarded him steadily . Poor old Stephenhe looked very tired . As for herself , from the nature of his smile Jane knew what she looked like . There was absolutely nothing to be done about it . She looked like Jane . P255I 'd go , if I were you , ' said Silly . It 's only for a week , of course , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrot , ' said Silly . Oh , yes , ' said Jane . It 's just moving them back West . ' Stephen can do that , ' said Silly . They were lying side by side in the shadow of a rock on the sands of Pine Island . Two weeks of Stephen 's precious holiday had already passed . The litter of a picnic luncheon defiled the beach at their feet . A few yards away little Steve , in his scarlet bathing-suit , was digging a canal in the wet brown sand where the waves were breaking . Cicily and Jenny were tossing a baseball back and forth , a little farther down the beach . Stephen and Alden , leaning back against a boulder , were enjoying their after-luncheon cigarettes and discussing the hilarities of the twenty-fifth reunion of the Class of ' 88 , which Alden had superintended at Cambridge the preceding June . And on Sunday , ' said Alden , with a reminiscent chuckle , we had an excursion by steamer to Gloucester . Some excursion ! More liquid in the bar than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repeated Silly . I 'd do whatever I wanted to , whenever I could . ' On Silly 's lips the simple statement took on a wistful significance . Jane 's absent eyes had been fixed on her unconscious children . She turned , now , to contemplate her sister-in-law . Silly 's long angular frame was carelessly clothed in a weatherbeatenbrown tweed skirt and sun-streaked tan sweater . A dilapidated brown felt hat of Alden 's was pulled well down over her forehead to protect her eyes from the glare . Her clean white sport shirt was buttoned mannishly about her neck , and a diamond horseshoe pin , which had been Mr. Carver 's generous gesture on the occasion of her forty-fifth birthday , was negligently thrust through her orange tie . It twinkled , inappropriately , in the brilliant sunshine . She lay flat on her back on the beach , gazing up at the silver clouds that floated in the stainless August sky . A queer weatherbeatenfigure curiously akin to the rocks and the sands and the clumps of stunted pine trees that gave the island its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it seemed to Jane , a beautiful one at the moment . The rough outline of tweed and worsted could not conceal the Diana-like grace of Silly 's lank body , nor mar the delicacy of her slender ankles nor the strength of her slim wrists nor the angular beauty of her long , lean hands . Jane peeped under the turned-down hat-brim . Silly might boast the body of a goddess , but her face was uncompromisinglythat of a forty-six-year-old New England spinster . Plain , tanned , and austere , it was set in its familiar lines of controlled resignation . When had Silly ever done what she wanted to , thought Jane ? Never since Jane had known her . For the last fifteen years , as all the Carvers knew quite well , Silly had wanted to do only one thing . To break away from the family and the place at Gull Rocks and the house on Beacon Street and buy a little stone-strewn farm at Topsfield , Massachusetts , and keep cocker-spaniel kennels there with Susan Frothingham . Susan was now forty-eight . For the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Frothinghams on Arlington Street and live with Silly on a Topsfield hilltop . Jane saw no charms in Susan . A fat , uninteresting New England old maid , if there ever was one . Still  --  if Silly liked her and she liked Silly  --  it was dreadful what life did to single women . What families did to single women . Well-to-do families , throwing destitute middle-aged daughters an occasional diamond horseshoe , but denying them the right to independence . The right to life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness . P257If you want to go to New York to see Agnes , ' pursued Silly , still gazing at the silver cloud , I think you ought to go . ' Your mother wo n't like to have Stephen take the children back West alone , ' said Jane . I 'm tired of seeing the men in this family considered ! ' said Silly with sudden violence . I 'd like to see one of the women get her innings for a change . ' Oh , I never consider Stephen much , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innings . ' Well , this is an outing , ' smiled Silly . How long since you 've seen Agnes ? ' Oh , mercy ! ' said Jane . Ever so long ! Seven years . Not since she married . The last time I saw her was when she came West for her father 's funeral . ' I think you ought to go , ' repeated Silly . Mother wo n't care as long as you 're going to meet Flora . ' That was probably true , thought Jane . The bond between Mrs. Carver and her brother was a very close one . Flora and Mr. Furness were on the water now , returning from a summer in England . Whatever Mrs. Carver might think of the folly of a headstrong daughter-in-law who deserted her husband and children to spend a week in New York for the purpose of seeingan old Bryn Mawr classmate , she would consider it a very suitable attention for Stephen 's wife to meet his uncle and cousin on the dock at Hoboken , bearing appropriate greetingsfrom the Boston connection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had seen her in Chicago at Easter and would see her again there in two weeks at the very latest . But the Furnesses ' arrivaldid make a plausible pretext for a trip to New York , and Jane did care , terribly , about being with Agnes again for a few days and seeing her five-year-old daughter and meeting the gentleman whom Jane had always privately characterized as that dreadful husband . ' In Jane 's opinion , Agnes had ruined her life by marrying Jimmy Trent . She never understood how it could have happened . Level-headed Agnes , at the great age of thirty-one , with a reputation really established as a writer of short stories , with one good novel published and a better one half-finished , had succumbed to the incomprehensible charm of a ne'er-dowelljournalist , hanging about the outskirts of the newspaper world of New York , three years younger than Agnes and perfectlyincapable of holding down a lucrative job for more than two months at a time . When Jane considered Agnes as she had been in college , the marriage was really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the level head triumphantly crowned with a wreath of potted ivy , saying seriously , I 'm not at all romantic . I just want to accomplish . ' One moment of romance had ruined for Agnes ten years of accomplishment . The baby had come at once , of course , and the second novel had never been finished . After a year or two of living in boarding-houses and trying to subsist on Jimmy 's non-existent income , Agnes had abandoned her writing and had taken a job in the advertising department of Macy 's . It was a good job , she had written Jane very cheerfully , at the time . She liked advertising . On the whole , she liked it better than writing . They had taken a nice little flat in Greenwich Village and little Agnes was established in a play school at the age of three and Jimmy did a little writing , now and then , mainly musical criticism , and worked with his fiddle , which amused him awfully , and took her to hear a lot of good music , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curled as she remembered that letter . She had wish I could see you , ' Agnes had written . Jimmy may go West for a few months . He 's had a temporary position offered him on the Chicago " Daily News . " I hope he takes it . I 'd like him to see Chicago . Of course I have to stick at Macy 's . ' Jane read between the lines just what Agnes really wanted . She wanted Jane to meet Jimmy and like Jimmy and make things pleasant for him in Chicago , so that he would hold down this new job and make life a little easier for them all , financiallyspeaking , when he returned to the Greenwich Village flat . Jane did n't relish the task . She knew perfectly well what she would think of Jimmy and what Stephen would think of Jimmy and what her mother and Isabel and even her father would think of Jimmy , when he showed up in the West . But Agnes was Agnes . And Agnes 's husband was Agnes 's husband . Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would like to go to New York and look over the field . Stephen ! ' called Silly suddenly . Do n't you think Jane ought to go to New York ? ' Sure I do , ' said Stephen amicably . I 'm going to make her go . Of course , I 've never seen the fatal charm in AgnesBut you 're a perfect husband ! ' cried Jane , sitting up in the sunshine . It 's time we set sail for home . Come on , girls ! ' Cicily and Jenny turned at her call . Jenny threw the baseball , with unerring aim , straight into the group around the picnic basket . It landed with a plop , right in the centre of her father 's waistcoat . Cicily and Jenny and little Steve all burst into laughter as he collapsed in mock agony under the force of the blow . Jenny came running up in hilarious apology . An Alice in Wonderland child , with straight fair hair strained back from a round comb on her forehead , and a plain practicallittle face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had none of Cicily 's blonde beauty . Come help us pack up , ' said Jane . We must leave a clean beach . ' She was picking up eggshells as she spoke . Silly 's support had strengthened her determination . She would go to New York . Suddenly she realized that she was humming aloud . The refrain of an old Bryn Mawr song , Once there dwelt captiously a stern papa ! ' Good gracious ! She had n't thought of it for nearly twenty years ! It would be fun to see Agnes again.  |p261NEVERTHELESS  , seven days later , as Jane stood on the platform of the Bay State Limited in the Boston South Station , wavinggood-bye to Stephen and the children and Miss Parrot , she felt her eyes fill suddenly with tears . She was always , absurd over partings . That very morning , on the front porch at Gull Rocks , when she was saying good-bye to Mr. and Mrs. Carver and Uncle Stephen and Aunt Marie , she had felt a sudden surge of emotion . They were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten months . They had been awfully good to her . The congenital peculiarities of Carvers already seemed harmless . Jane had embraced her relatives-in-law with ardour . And now , at the sight of the little smiling , waving group on the dingy platform , Jane had an almost irresistible impulse to jump off the New York train and return to the West with her family at half-after two that afternoon . Mumsy ! ' shouted Cicily , hanging on Stephen 's arm . Can I order the meals ' til you get home ? ' Do n't you let her ! ' cried Jenny , tripping over the cockerspanielpuppy 's leash in her excitement . She 'd forget and we 'd starve ! ' Now , do n't worry about anything , Mrs. Carver , ' called Miss Parrot , almost losing her balance as little Steve tugged at her hand . He was on his knees on the platform , peering under the train . I want to see the air brakes ! ' he cried . Have a whirl with Agnes , ' smiled Stephen . Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I wo n't , ' said Jane . But I know I 'll hate him . ' The train jerked into motion . Jane pushed by the porter to the step of the car . Kiss me again , Stephen ! ' she cried . Stephen jumped to the step beside her . She raised her lips to his . Suddenly he realized that she was crying . Good-bye , goose ! ' he said tenderly . As the train gathered speed , he swung back on the platform . Do n't worry ! ' called Miss Parrot again , dragging little Steve to his feet . The children were all waving wildly . Stephenthrew a last kiss . The porter led Jane firmly back into the vestibule and closed the train doors . She could n't see the family any longer . She hoped Miss Parrot would hold little Steve 's hand until they were out of the trainshed . It would be just like him to run out on the tracks . But she would , of course . She was very responsible . Jane made her way slowly back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ car . She was really off . She had not been in New York since she came home from Europe , eight years before . It would be fun to see Agnes again . The children would be perfectly safe with Miss Parrot . And she would be home in a week . IIThe heat of the September day still pervaded the city streets as Jane descended from the top of the Fifth Avenue bus and turned , a trifle uncertainly , under the arch , to walk south and west across Washington Square . Jane had had very little experience in looking after herself and she always felt a trifle uncertain when wandering alone in strange places . Earlier that very afternoon , in emerging from the Bay State Limited , she had found the congested turmoil of the Grand Central 63Station a little overwhelming . It had seemed quite an adventureto choose a black porter and follow him as he threaded his way through the crowded concourse and out past the swinging doors through the traffic of Forty-Second Street to the lobby of the Belmont Hotel . Jane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the desk , her luggage at her feet , signing the register and asking for a single room and bath for the night . It was perfectly ridiculous  --  she was thirty-six years old  --  but Jane really could n't remember ever having spent a night alone at a hotel before . She was very glad that Flora and Mr. Furness would join her at noon next day and greatly relieved to discover that a letter from Agnes was waiting for her , confirming her invitation to dinner and containing explicit directions as to how to reach the Greenwich Village flat . Come at six , ' Agnes had written . I get out of Macy 's at five-thirty and I 'll be there before you . ' She was perhaps a trifle early , reflected Jane , as she paused in the path to reassure herself as to just which direction was west . She had allowed too much time for the bus ride through the afternoon traffic . She had been glad to get out of her hotel bedroom . Once her bag was unpacked , there was nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had seemed at once curiously starched and soiled , at the taxis and street-cars that congested Forty-Second Street and the crowds of suburbanites who were pouring into the entrance of the Grand Central Station . She had watched the station clock for fifteen minutes and when the hands pointed to five she had left the room . Washington Square , thought Jane , gazing curiously about her , was n't all it was cracked up to be . It did n't look like the cradle from which a city 's aristocracy had sprung . There was a nice old row of red-brick houses at the north end , but many of them seemed rather gone to seed and dilapidated , and the grass in the Square was worn down to hard-caked mud and the elm trees were leafless , and the shirt-sleeved men and shawled women on the benches and the dirty little darkeyedchildren who were playing marbles and hopscotch on the path were the kind that you would only see west of Clark Street ' at home . Jane left the Square at the southwest corner and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given her , plunged into the congestion of the city streets . This was a funny place to choose to live in , thought Jane , as she pushed through a group of pale-faced little girls , skipping rope on the sidewalk . It was a funny place to choose in which to bring up a child . A group of shabby young men , hanging about the entrance of a corner saloon , commented favourably on her appearance as she approached them . Jane held her chin high and passed on in disdain . The green baize door swung open to admit an elderly hobo and Jane caught a whiff , across the stale heat of the pavement , of the acrid damp odour of beer . She thought the disreputable bar looked rather cool and dark and inviting from the glare of the city street . She could quite understand why the group of shabby young men liked to linger there . At the next corner she stood amazed and delighted at the sight that met her eye . A curving vista of narrow street , flanked by tall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escapes were festooned with varicoloured washing and all the windows were wide open and the window-sills were hung with bedding . From nearly every window a darkhairedwoman and a couple of children were hanging out , leaning on the bedding and gazing down at the street beneath them . The street itself was crowded with push carts and fruit stands . Great piles of golden oranges and yellow bananasP265were displayed for sale . Clothing hung fluttering from improvisedframe scaffolds . A fish vendor was crying his wares at her elbow . The front steps of all the houses were crowded with people laughing and talking together and shouting to the purchasers that clustered about the open-air booths . The dingy store on the corner had a sign in its dirty window , Ice  --  kindling  --  coal and charcoal . ' A little olive-faced girl came out of it balancing an old peach basket on her head . It contained a melting lump of ice . She skipped gaily down the street and vanished into a basement entrance . The store on the opposite corner had a foreign sign in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Speciality in Pasta Fresca . ' Jane was suddenly enchanted with Greenwich Village . Still  --  it was a funny place to choose in which to bring up a child . Presently she came to Agnes 's corner . Charlton Street was quite broad and paved with cobblestones . A car-track ran down the centre of the street . The houses on both sides were built of red brick , with white frame doorways . Nice whitepanelledfront doors with fanlights above them and brass knobs and knockers , some brightly polished . The windows were all square-paned and many of the houses had green window-boxes . The plants in them were drab and shrivelled , however , in the city heat . Jane did not see a single flower . Agnes 's house was in the centre of the block . It looked just like all the others . There was a sign in the downstairs front window , Furnished Room . Gents Preferred . ' Jane mounted the front steps and regarded the empty hole , where a doorbell had once hung , for a moment in perplexity . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a small whitepanelledvestibule , carpeted with yellow linoleum . Three mail-boxes met her eye and on the middle one a card , Mr. and Mrs. James Trent . ' She pushed the electric bell beneath the mail-box and , after a minute or two in which absolutely nothing happened , she opened the inner door . The odour of cooking cabbage instantly assailed her nostrils . The entrance to the first apartment was on her left hand . A white-panelled door , soiled with countless finger-prints . A straight , steep staircase , with uncarpeted wooden treads , led to the upper floors . Jane slowly ascended the stairs into comparative darkness . The odour of cooking cabbage grew fainter . At the front end of the upper corridor was a second white-panelled door . Jane knocked at it tentatively . She heard , immediately , the sound of masculine footsteps and the airy notes of a masculine whistle , a fragment of La Donna e mobile ' from Rigoletto . ' The door was suddenly opened by a young man . He stood smiling at her on the threshold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and an open collar , who looked , Jane thought from the dusk of the corridor , with his quizzical eyebrows and his pointed ears and his ironical smile , exactly like a faun . Come in , ' he said pleasantly . I  --  I 'm looking for Mrs. James Trent , ' said Jane . Come in , ' the young man repeated . Jane stepped , a little hesitantly , over the threshold . You must be Jane . ' His smile deepened into a grin of appreciation . You do n't look at all as I thought you would . Come in and sit down . Agnes will be home any minute . ' Then , as she continued to stare at him in perplexity , I 'm Jimmy . ' Jane 's eyes widened with astonishment . This boy , Jimmy  --  Agnes 's husband ? He did not look a day over twenty-five . Jane knew he was thirty-four , however . Oh  --  how do you do ? ' she said . Yes  --  I 'm Jane . ' Agnes 's living-room was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rococo design in plaster that looked , Jane thought , like the top of a weddingp267cake . A charming Victorian mantel of white marble dominatedone end of the room . It was adorned with a bas-relief of cupids holding horns of plenty in their chubby arms . The cupids were dusty and the hearth was discoloured and the fireplace was filled with sheets of musical manuscript , torn in twain . Two tall chintz-hung windows looked over Charlton Street and a battered davenport sofa was placed beneath them . The sofa was strewn with other sheets of music , and a violin lay on a pile of disordered cushions in one corner . The top of the mantelpiece was piled with books , and a high white bookcase , filled with heterogeneous volumes , occupied one end of the room . A small gate-legged table , covered with a clean linen cloth , stood near the hearth , with an armchair on one side of it and a child 's Shaker rocker on the other . Through the half-open folding-doors across from the fireplace Jane caught a glimpse of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor was strewn with toys and a white iron crib stood near the window . Sit down , ' said Jimmy , throwing an armful of music from the sofa to the floor . Hot as hell , is n't it ? ' I 'm afraid I 'm very early , ' said Jane , sitting down in the armchair . No . Agnes is late , ' said Jimmy . He was standing before the Victorian mantel , still regarding her with an appreciative grin . You look as cool as a cucumber in that blue silk . Maybe I ought to put on my coat . ' Oh , no , ' said Jane politely . She had n't noticed his shirtsleevesuntil that moment . Well , anyway , a necktie , ' persisted Jimmy engagingly , fingering his open collar . You look very nice and Byronic as you are , ' smiled Jane . I know I do , ' said Jimmy rather surprisingly . I get awaywith a lot of that Byron stuff . But just the same I think I owe that French frock a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke and , opening a door , disappeared into the inner recesses of the apartment . Jane , left to herself , began to inspect the room once more without rising from her chair . Her eyes wandered to the high bookcase . She recognized some old Bryn Mawr books that had adorned , for two years , the walls of her Pembroke study . The two small blue volumes of Palgrave 's Golden Treasury . ' The green Globe editions of Wordsworth and Shakespeare . The Buxton Forman Keats and Shelley . The Mermaid Series of Elizabethan dramatists . And the long dark red line of Matthew Arnold and Pater . The sound of running water from the interior of the apartment distracted her attention . Jimmy was a great surprise . She had never thought that he would be like that . She glanced at the sheets of music on the sofa . The one on top of the pile was half-filled with pencilled notations . He must have been writing music . Evidently he was a composer on the side . Agnes had never mentioned that . The door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ freshly washed and brushed , his collar rebuttoned , and a soft blue necktie bringing out the colour in his smiling eyes . He picked up his coat from the back of the sofa and put it on with a sigh . What men do for women ! ' he murmured as he adjusted his collar . What women do for men ! ' laughed Jane . This dress is French , but it 's fearfully hot . ' I bet you did n't put it on for me ! ' grinned Jimmy . Jane 's blush acknowledged the home thrust . You just wanted to show Agnes how well you 'd withstood the assaults of time . ' Jane had thought Agnes might think the dress was pretty . Not that Agnes ever noticed clothes , of course . P269You must have been an infant prodigy , ' went on Jimmy . He was sitting on the sofa now , his elbows on his knees , his eyes fixed flatteringly on her face . Why ? ' asked Jane unguardedly . To have been Agnes 's classmate , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . She did n't like it at all . That was no way for Agnes 's husband to speak of Agnes . I wish she 'd come home , ' she said with severity . Do you ? ' smiled Jimmy . Well , she will soon . She stops at the Play School every evening to bring home the child . It began again last week , thank God ! Another day of vacation and I should have committed infanticide . ' Jane did not reply to this sally . She continued to look , very seriously , at Jimmy . But he rattled on , ignoring her silence . A Play School is a wonderful invention . It takes children off their parents ' hands for nine hours a day . I call it immoral  --  but very convenient . So much immorality is merely convenience , is n't it ? We resort to it , faute de mieux . Saloons and play schools and brothels  --  they 're all cheap compromises , forced on us by civilization . In an ideal Utopia I suppose we 'd all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do it and like it  --  though that seems rather a contradiction in terms . Progressive education is really only one of many symptoms of decadence . It 's a sign of the fall of the empire . ' He paused abruptly and looked charmingly over at Jane , as if waiting for her applause . Jane felt an inexplicable impulse not to applaud him . That 's all very clever , ' she said quickly . But of course it is n't true . ' Jimmy burst into amiable laughter . So you are a pricker of bubbles , are you , Jane ? ' he asked amusedly . You certainly do n't look it . Are you a defender of the truth and no lover of dialectic for dialectic 's sake ? Do beautiful rainbow-coloured bubbles , all made up of watery ideas and soapy vocabulary , floating airily , without foundation , in the void , mean nothing in your life ? ' Very little , ' said Jane severely . I 'm a very practical person . ' I seem to be a creature of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can only repeat  --  you do n't look it ! The picture you present , as you sit in that armchair , Jane , is far from practical  --  ' As he spoke , Jane heard with relief the sound of a latchkeyin the outer door . That 's Agnes ! ' she cried , springing to her feet . It must be , ' said Jimmy , rising reluctantly to his . The door opened quickly , and Agnes , hand in hand with her five-year-old daughter , stood beaming on the threshold . Just the same old Agnes , with her funny freckled face and her clever cheerful smile ! No  --  somehow a slightly plumper , rather more solid Agnes , with a certain maturity of gesture and authority of eye ! Jane clasped her in her arms . It was not until the embrace was over that she noticed how grey Agnes 's hair had grown . It showed quite plainly under her broad hat-brim . Jane sank on her knees before the child . She looked a little pale and peaked , Jane thought , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes that Jane had known in the first grades of Miss Milgrim 's School ! How preposterous  --  how ridiculous  --  to see that little Agnes once more in the flesh ! How absurdly touching ! Jane clasped the child gently in her arms . Agnes ! ' she cried . She 's precious ! She 's just like you ! ' Unfortunately , ' remarked Agnes with mock cynicism . When she might have favoured her fascinating father ! Whateveryou may say against Jimmy , Jane , you have to admit hep271has looks . In six years of matrimony they 've never palled on me . ' Do n't talk like that , Agnes , ' remonstrated Jimmy promptly . You make me feel superficial . I 've much more than looks . I 've all the social graces . I 've been exhibiting them for Jane 's benefit for the last twenty minutes and I leave it to her if my face is my fortune ! I 've many more important assets . ' How about it , Jane ? ' said Agnes , smiling . Did he make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam of real concern in Agnes 's glance . She suddenly recalled that winter afternoon , sixteen years ago , when she had first displayed Stephen to Agnes in Mr. Ward 's library on Pine Street . Handsomeyoung Stephen , flushed from the winter cold ! She remembered her own dismay at the unspoken verdict of cotillionpartner ' in Agnes 's honest eyes . Y-yes , ' she said slowly , with a twinkle , rising to her feet , still holding the child 's hand in hers . I think he did  --  for a first impression . ' If anything , ' said Jimmy engagingly , I improve on acquaintance . I 'm an acquired taste , like ripe olives . I feel that 's been said before . Let 's say I 'm a bad habit , like nicotineor alcohol . Once you take me up , you 'll find it hard to get on without me . ' Do n't be ridiculous ! ' said Agnes . She threw a glance at Jane to see how she was taking his banter . I was just warning her , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Agnes . Now , that 's just the sort of thing she 's always said of you , ' sighed Jimmy plaintively . It gave me such a false impression . I 've never been attracted by the type of woman who does n't need to be warned against a handsome man Agnes , ' interrupted Jane , is he always like this ? ' Always , ' said Agnes , with great good cheer . She looked distinctly relieved by Jane 's frivolous question . She knew now that Jane was taking Jimmy in the right spirit . Sometimeshe 's worse . ' She placed her hand affectionately on Jimmy 's shoulder . How did the music go to-day , old top ? ' Oh  --  rotten ! ' said Jimmy lightly . My rondo 's a flop . ' He 's writing a concerto for the violin , ' explained Agnes , with a glance at the music on the sofa . Really ? ' cried Jane , honestly impressed . Then , turning to Jimmy , Are n't you excited about it ? ' He met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' he said calmly , I 've lost my first fine careless rapture . I 've been writing it for ten years . ' Some of it 's very good , ' said Agnes . And some of it is n't , ' pursued Jimmy cheerfully . I want him to finish it , ' said Agnes . And I 'm eager to please , ' said Jimmy . So I sit here , day after day , pouring my full heart in profuse strains of unpremeditatedart , while Agnes supports me in the style to which I was never accustomed before she laid me on the lap of luxury . I do n't get much done , however . ' His voice sounded a little discouraged , Jane thought , in spite of his levity . Agnes changed the subject abruptly . We 're dining out at a restaurant , ' she said . I wo n't cook dinner in hot weather . ' She 's a swell cook , you know , ' said Jimmy to Jane . I 've known it for twenty years , ' said Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child , ' said Agnes . She opened the door through which Jimmy had vanished in quest of his necktie . It led into a narrow dark corridor . Agnes pushed open another door and Jane found herself in a bedroom . A very dark bedroom , with one corner window openingon a dingy airshaft . No electricity , ' said Agnes . It 's a curse . ' She struck ap273match and lit a flaring gas jet beside a maple bureau . The bureau and two iron beds completely filled the room . One bed was neatly made and covered with a cotton counterpane . The other was in complete disorder . Jimmy never gets up until after I 've gone in the morning , ' said Agnes apologetically , so he never gets his bed made until I come home at night . ' As she spoke she picked up a pair of pajamas from the floor and hung them on a peg behind the door . A couple of discarded neckties were strewn on top of the bureau . Agnes added them to a long row of other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off her hat , without even a glance at the mirror , and opening a bureau drawer , took out a clean blue romper for the child . Jane suddenly realized that Agnes looked tired . Her . hair was really very grey . I ' 11 make the bed , ' said Jane . Oh  --  do you want to ? ' asked Agnes . Jane nodded . Well , it would save time . ' She vanished into the bathroom with her daughter . Jane walked very soberly over to the bed and pulled off the sheets and turned the mattress . She heard once more the sound of running water . This bedroom was not fit to live in , thought Jane . A black hole of Calcutta . How could Agnes put up with it ? How could Agnes put up with a husband who did n't get out of bed in the morning until after she had gone down to her office to earn his living ? Jane tucked the bottom sheet firmly under the mattress . She 'd like to take Jimmy by the ear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed , while Agnes sat in a rocking-chair and watched him do it . Jane was thoroughly shocked by Agnes 's revelation . Lots of wives , of course , lay serenely in bed every morning until long after the bread-winner had departed for his day 's work . But that seemed different , somehow . Why did it ? If Jimmy had nothing in life to get up for , there was , of course , no real reason for his getting up . Still Jane smoothed the blankets and turned to pick up the counterpane from the window-sill . Was n't Jimmy acting just the way she had always wished that Stephen sometimes would ? Stephen thought the world would come to an end if he did not catch the eight o'clock train every morning at the Lakewood Station . Jane had been mocking that delusion of Stephen 's for the last fifteen years . Agnes reentered the room with a clean blue-rompered daughter at her side . Jane smoothed the counterpane over the pillow . Agnes walked over to the bureau and , still withoutglancing in the mirror @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Agnes did her hair just the way she always had since the day that she first put it up  --  a big figure eight twisted halfway up her head in the back . She had always run a comb through it just like that , without a thought for a looking-glass . Come on , ' said Agnes . Jimmy rose from the sofa as they entered the living-room . Where are we going ? ' he asked . Tony 's ? ' I thought so , ' said Agnes . Then , turning to Jane , Or do you hate Italian food ? ' The night was so hot that Jane thought that she would hate food of any nationality . I love it , ' she said falsely . They all walked down the corridor and the uncarpeted stairs into the odour of cooking cabbage and out into the comparativefreshness of the sultry street . Tony 's is just around the corner , ' said Agnes . She slipped one arm through Jane 's and the other through Jimmy 's . Little Agnes skipped on ahead of them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as her parents did . Jane threw a glance past Agnes 's clever , contented face to jimmy'sP275faun-like countenance . It was clever , too , but it was n't very contented , Jane thought . In the grey September twilight Jimmy looked older than he had in the softer light of the chintz-hung living-room . Suddenly he met her eyes and smiled . This is swell ! ' he said cheerfully . But an embarrassment of riches ! Taking two beautiful women out to dinner at Tony 's the same night ! ' And suddenly he began softly , ridiculously , to sing . How happy could I be with either , Were t' other dear charmer away ! ' A wrinkled old woman , pulling a little wagon full of kindling , turned to smile toothlessly up at him at the sound of his artless tenor . He grinned at her pleasantly and resumed his song . Jimmy might be irritating , thought Jane , and of course he was a worthless husband , but he had charm . IIIThe waiter 's hand , which touched Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt damp and warmly clammy . His collar was wilted and great drops of perspirationbeaded his swarthy brow . Throughout the meal Jane had seen him surreptitiously mopping it with the wrinkled napkin that hung over his arm . Tony 's ' was hot and very crowded . Vaguely conscious of having eaten too much garlic in the salad and too much cheese in the spaghetti and of having drunk rather more Chianti than was perhaps quite wise on such a warm evening , Jane was half-listening to Jimmy , who was conversing most intelligently on modern American music , and half-reflecting that little Agnes , who had eaten quite as much garlic and cheese as she had herself , should have been in bed hours ago and would certainly be sick when once she was . The child was half-asleep in her chair.  | Agnes was arguing with Jimmy , also most intelligently , on modern American music and every one else within hearing at the little candlelit tables seemed to be arguing also . Across the room four dark-eyed , oily-headed , hairy-wristed young men were certainly arguing very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just beyond them , a middleagedwoman with short grey hair and a green smock was arguing in tense undertones with her adolescent escort as to whether or no he should order another apricot brandy , and at the round table in the middle of the room an uproarious group of young men and women were shouting their argumentson the relative merits of Matisse and Picasso , two painters , apparently , of whom , until that moment , Jane had never even heard . In spite of the heat and the garlic and the cheese and the arguments , and , possibly , Jane thought , partly because of the Chianti , she had enjoyed the evening very much indeed . It was fun to be with Agnes again and fun , after two months at Gull Rocks , to be chattering carelessly with contemporaries whose intellectual slant on life was the same as her own . Moreover , Jane , in the course of the evening , had become comfortingly reassured about Jimmy . Why , she almost understood , already , why Agnes had married him . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was very much sweeter with Agnes and his little daughter thar Jane had expected him to be after his cavalier references to them in his initial advances toward her . He did not seem at all like Agnes 's husband , of course . He did not seem like any one 's husband . More like some young relative  --  a brother or a cousin or even a nephew  --  whose attitude toward his family was marked by humorous detachment , affectionate and appreciative , but distinctly irresponsible . His attitude toward Jane had been marked by a mocking , P277but flattering , attention and a rapidly increasing sense of intimacy . There was something in his manner , not at all unpleasant , that seemed subtly to suggest that he was always remembering that Jane was a woman and never allowing her to forget that he was a man . Jane could not think of any other American husband who was just like him . Bert Lancaster , of course , was always woman-conscious , but in a slimy , satyrish sort of way that bore no resemblance to Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thanked God that there were two sexes . There was a friendly matter-of-factness about Jimmy 's frank admiration that made Jane feel very sure that they would get on well together . She was glad that he was coming to Chicago . He was coming , almost immediately , to take up a friend 's job as musical critic on the Daily News , ' while that friend spent the winter in Munich . He was bringing his fiddle and the unfinished concerto and he expected to get a great deal of work done in some boarding-house bedroom , with no woman around to distract him . Agnes hoped that he would . She hoped to do some writing herself , in the evenings after little Agnes was in bed . Not the novel , of course  --  she would never finish that now ; but she had plots for a couple of short stories that she thought she could sell and  --  Jane would laugh at her , she knew  --  an idea for a play about newspaper life that had never been done before . Jane did not laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's concerto , but she longed to see Agnes take up writing again . She thought that Jimmy would like Chicago . She would introduce him to all Agnes 's old friends and Stephen would put him up at the clubsHe had n't better do that , ' Jimmy had interrupted lightly . At the only club I ever belonged to I was kicked out for nonpaymentof dues . I should n't advise a conservative banker to back me at another   Jane had laughed at his nonsense , wondering , however , just how much Stephen would have laughed had he been present that evening . Jimmy did not seem just Stephen 's kind . Somethingtold her that Jimmy would not take the importance of bank mergers very seriously , and that to Stephen a man withoutvisible means of support , who had spent ten years of his life writing a concerto for the violin , would seem rather one of the broader jokes  --  unless he seemed just an object of charity , in which case Stephen would be very kind and considerateand helpful , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly , in the midst of the argument on modern American music , you ought to put that child to bed . ' I know I ought , ' said Agnes , rising regretfully from her chair , but it 's such fun to be with you again , Jane , and Jimmy 's always so pyrotechnic in the presence of a third person ! When I get arguing with him , I never want to stop ! ' Not only , ' said Jimmy mockingly , in the presence of a third person . Night after night , Jane , while Agnes is arguing with me , the child falls asleep on the hearth rug . ' He , too , was rising regretfully to his feet . He picked up his drowsy daughter . Can I get a taxi down here ? ' asked Jane . Jimmy 'll cruise out and find one , ' said Agnes . He left the restaurant with the child on his shoulder . Agnes sank back into her chair . Suddenly she leaned forward across the candlelight . If I could write a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bad play , such as managers have confidence in , it might run for a season . If it did , I 'd make fifty thousand dollars . ' Oh , Agnes ! ' said Jane reproachfully . Do n't talk like that ! You never used to . Why do you want to write a bad play  --  P279just for a manager ? Write a good one if it never gets on . I bet you could . You have lots of ideas  --  you always had  --  ' Exactly , ' said Agnes , briefly . I 've always had more ideas than cash . ' Her face clouded a little under Jane 's incredulous stare , then lightened suddenly with conviction . If you think there 's an idea in my head that I would n't sacrifice for a dollar , you 're very much mistaken . Jane  --  you have to have money to be happy . If I could make fifty thousand dollars , I 'd put every cent of it in trust for little Agnes . It would clothe her and educate her and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd never have to worry about the future again . I would n't feel anxious and driven any longer and I 'd stop nagging Jimmy the way I have nagged him ever since Agnes was born , and if I stopped nagging him , we 'd have time to talk together the way we used to  --  to be together the way we used to Jimmy 's adorable when he is n't nagged  --  I adore him when I 'm nagging him . But I just ca n't help it . I 'm growing cross and nervous and old before my timeand ' Taxi waiting ! ' said Jimmy , at Jane 's elbow . He looked a little curiously , Jane thought , at Agnes 's excited face . But he asked no questions . Agnes rose from the table without speaking . Her hands were trembling a little as she picked up her daughter 's hat from the back of her chair . Jane followed her out onto the sidewalk in silence . She was almost trembling herself from the contagion of Agnes 's excitement . Or was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ private life through the rent that Agnes had torn in the curtain that hides the private lives of all married couples from the eyes of the world . She was acutely conscious of the intimacy of the moment that had just passed between them . And terribly sorry for Agnes . And for Jimmy . And terribly thankful , in the dark of the uptown bound taxi , for a husband like Stephen , who was a banker and caught the eight o'clock train every morning and did n't write concertos and lie in bed and goad her into nagginghim until Jane was so preoccupied with thoughts of husbands and marriage , and what life did to girls who were once young and full of promise and sat on Bryn Mawr window-seats confidentlyassuming that the world was their oyster , that she almost forgot to feel queer as she passed through the lobby of the Belmont Hotel alone at midnight . But not quite . I thought you 'd be more enthusiastic , ' said Flora . I am enthusiastic , ' protested Jane . It 's just that I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of Flora 's bed at the Belmont . The room was crowded with gaping trunks and strewn with the silk and satin confusion of Flora 's new winter wardrobe , fresh from the fingers of the Paris dressmakers . Flora , very chic and fair in a new sheath dress of black chiffon , was fasteningon her slender wrist the first diamond wrist watch that Jane had ever seen . She was wearing the first slit skirt that Jane had ever seen , also . Jane could not keep her eyes off the unseemly exposure of Flora 's slender black legs . Flora had said they were wearing dresses like that in the streets of Paris . Be that as it may , ' thought Jane , in the streets of Chicago that skirt will look very queer . ' But Flora was only superficially preoccupied with slit skirts and wrist watches . She had been unfolding to Jane het plans for the winter . Jane wondered what her mother and Isabel would think of them . For those plans were very surprising . Flora , incredibly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , of all places , in the old brown-stone stable in the back yard on Rush Street . Lots of women are doing it in London , ' said Flora . I 've got the duckiest French models and a very clever French vendeuse to help me . We 're going to make hats on the head , you know , just the way they do in Paris . I 'm going to turn the coach-house into a show-room and make fitting-rooms out of the stalls . The workshop will be in the hayloft . Papa sold the Daimler last spring , and he thinks it would really be more convenient to use cabs this winter than buy a new one . I 'm going to have a black-and-gold sign made to put over the door  --  " Chez Flora , " in a facsimile of my own handwriting . And copy it for the tags inside the hats . That lid of yours is a fright , Jane . It looks almost like Silly 's . I bet you bought it in Boston . You must be my first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's , thought Jane indignantly . Then , as she recovered from the passing insult , Do you expect to make much money ? ' Jane had been thinking rather wistfully of money and of the difficulty of making it , since her dinner last night with Agnes . Oh , I do n't know , ' said Flora easily . I guess so . My expenseswill be quite heavy . If I do I 'll give it away , of course . ' To whom ? ' asked Jane . She was wondering already whether if she and Flora could get up a little trust fund for Agnes 's daughter , Agnes would consent to accept it . Oh  --  to some charity . I have n't thought which . My goodness , Jane , I do n't have to worry about that ! The poor we have always with us . Mrs. Lester would be glad to grab it for her crippled children . ' I see , ' said Jane doubtfully . She was not at all sure that she did . She could not help feeling that Flora @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything so unusual and so unusually unpleasant as running a hat shop . Of course , if it were for charityI do think , ' said Flora with conviction , that a really chic hat shop is needed in Chicago . But the main thing is  --  it will give me something to do . ' Across the brass hotel bedstead Jane looked at Flora . Her red-gold hair was just as shiny as ever , her figure was as slenderand her eyes as brightly blue . She had never lost that look of the Dresden-china shepherdess . Was it just because Flora had never really done anything that she still seemed as delicate and fragile and fair as a precious piece of porcelain ? Things had always been done to Flora . From the hour of her mother 's dreadful dishonoured death , her life had been swallowed up by her ageing father . He had carried her around an empty world , trying to fill its emptiness with her Dresden-china prettiness . She had summered in England and France and Germany and Switzerland . She had wintered in Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and closed the brown-stone house on Rush Street for innumerable brief Chicago seasons . But she had never settled down  --  never really belonged anywhere , since the winter of Muriel 's marriage . There had been , of course , that incident in Cairo , eleven years ago , with that young Englishman with the unbelievablyBritish name . Inigo Fellowes  --  that was it ! Jane had had a letter from Flora  --  such a happy letter  --  confidingthe secret of her engagement . And three weeks later a second letter , saying that Mr. Furness had been ill in Shepheard'sHotel and that Flora had been very much worried about him , and that the engagement was broken and that Flora was going to take her father to the South of France for the spring . Jenny had been born two days after the arrival of the second letter . Jane had been too preoccupied to think much about it . She did not see Flora again for two years , andP283Flora had never mentioned Inigo 's name . And now Mr. Furnesswas seventy-nine years old and really too feeble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was goingto open a hat shop in the brown-stone stable in the back yard . Jane thought she would much rather be as grey and as tired as Agnes and work in Macy 's advertising department and sleep in a black hole of Calcutta and nag a worthless husband and worry about a baby 's future than open a hat shop to give herself employment . But she only answered : Yes , of course it will , Flora . And I 'd love to buy a hat . So will Isabel , I know . And Muriel and Rosalie . ' She thought her encouragement sounded a triflehollow , however , and changed the subject brightly . Did you have fun this summer ? ' Yes , ' said Flora absently . We motored in Ireland . How was Gull Rocks ? Pretty dull ? ' Then , without waiting for ananswer , Oh , Jane ! Whom do you think I saw in London , just before nailed ? ' Jane could n't imagine . Andre Duroy ! ' cried Flora . After all these years ! In a picture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ishould never have known him . He asked after you , Jane . I told him all about your children . ' Jane sat a moment in silence . What  --  what was he like ? ' she ventured . Oh  --  funny , ' said Flora . He 's gone frog . He had a littleblack beard and a wife who could n't speak English . ' Nice-looking ? ' said Jane , after a pause . The beard or the wife ? ' questioned Flora . The wife , ' said Jane . Oh , very pretty , ' said Flora . A mere child . ' Jane sat another moment in silence . She could n't think of any other question to ask and Flora evidently considered the subject finished . Let 's get some theatre tickets , ' said Flora . I 'd like a gay evening . ' So would I , ' said Jane . She sprang up from the bed . I 'm here for a time and I mean to have it ! ' Flora took down the telephone receiver and called the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a magnificent dinner , ' she said . Jane did not answer . So Andre had gone frog and had a little black beard . It seemed only yesterday to Jane that she had noticed that Andre had begun to shave . And Cyprienne could n't speak English . She wondered if Flora had told him that Cicily was fourteen . Somehow she hoped that she had n't . Well  --  I guess this is good-bye , ' said Agnes . I hate to say it , ' said Jane . They were sitting on two high stools in a Broadway Huyler'sand had just finished a luncheon composed of a sandwichand a soda . Jane was going back to Chicago on the Twentieth Century Limited next day and that evening she and Flora and Mr. Furness were having a last whirl at the theatre . Jane had had a gay week in New York . She had seen six plays in seven days and all the picture exhibitions up and down Fifth Avenue and had gone twice to the Metropolitan , and had bought a new dress at Hollander 's and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had dined once again with Agnes and had had her and Jimmy to dine at the Belmontone evening before a symphony concert . P285This , of course , was Agnes 's noon hour . She had to be back at Macy 's in ten minutes . Jane seized the soda check and slipped regretfully from her stool . It has certainly been great to see you , ' she sighed . And you 'll take care of Jimmy in the corn belt , ' said Agnes a little wistfully . Of course I will , ' said Jane , pushing the check through the cashier 's cage . I think he 's a darling . When will he show up ? ' Oh  --  right away , ' said Agnes . He would have loved to go with you , Jane , but he has to pay his own expenses , so the Twentieth Century seemed foolish . He 'll loiter out on some milk train in a day or two and show up in Lakewood looking hungry for a square meal . ' Well , he 'll get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , darling '  --  Agnes looked steadily in Jane 's shining eyes  --  you are a darling , you know , Jane  --  wish me luck on the play ! ' You know I do , ' said Jane . I hope it 's bad enough to run forever . ' It wo n't be my fault if it is n't , ' said Agnes . She put one arm around Jane 's waist . Jane looked tenderly at her funny freckled face . Agnes , ' said Jane . You 're the most gallant person I ever knew . ' Agnes smiled in defensive mockery . No , ' said Agnes . You 've forgotten . Dido was that . ' Dido ? ' questioned Jane . Then she remembered . The memory of Agnes 's little front porch , west of Clark Street , ' rose before her . The AEneid and Andre and the Thomas Concert . No , ' she said earnestly , you beat Dido . I 'm going to see that the Eroica Symphony is played at your funeral pyre. '  |p286Jimmy  might whistle it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . Duty calls ! ' she said . Good-bye , old speed ! ' Jane watched her solid , slightly shabby figure disappear in the Broadway traffic . To Jane it looked very heroic . She was conscious , curiously enough , of a slight sense of envy . Agnes 's life , at least , was still an adventure . She was fighting odds and overcoming difficulties . She was struggling with life and love . Goodness ! Jane jumped  --  that taxi had almost exterminatedher ! If it had , thought Jane , as she pushed her way through the hurrying crowd of Broadway pedestrians , Agnes would have rated that best of epitaphs  --  I have lived and accomplished the task that Destiny gave me , and now I shall pass beneath the earth no common shade . ' Jane sat beside Flora in their compartment on the Twentieth Century , watching Flora and Mr. Furness play cribbage . She was thinking how much Mr. Furness looked like her motherin-lawand how much he looked a venerable codfish and how much more feeble he had grown during his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dealt the cards and fumbled as he fixed the little pegs in the holes in the cribbage board . The train had just passed Spuyten Duyvil and the Hudson stretched glittering , a river of steel , in the hazy September sunshine outside the window . It was warm in the compartment , in spite of the whirring electric fan , and Jane was not particularly interested in cribbage . She thought she would go back to the observation car and read a magazine . She said as much and Flora looked up patiently from the cribbage board . Flora was not particularlyinterested in cribbage either , but Mr. Furness loved it . Jane could remember him playing it with Flora 's motherP287in the green-and-gold parlour of the Rush Street house . She could . remember just how the rings had looked on Flora 's mother 's lovely listless hands as she moved the cribbage pegs . One of those rings , a sapphire between two diamonds , was on Flora 's hand that minute . And Flora 's hand was just as lovely and just as listless . Mr. Furness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane brutally . She walked through the plush and varnished comfort of the Twentieth Century thinking idly that Flora 's life was terrible . Nothing ever happened in it . She wondered in how many trains , bound for what exotic destinations , Flora had played cribbage with Mr. Furness . Of course , on the Twentieth Century Limited , just passing through Spuyten Duyvil , you would not expect anything very surprising to happen in any case , but on those trains de luxe , en route for Calcutta and Luxor ' and Moscow , had not Flora ever felt Jane passedfrom the narrow corridor to the observation compartment and saw Jimmy Trent , stretched comfortably in an armchair , scanning the columns of the Evening World . ' He saw her instantly and cast aside the paper . I was wondering when you would show up , ' he said casually . Then , rising to his feet , I saw you get aboard and took an upper on the same section . I was just about to page the train for you . ' Jane stared at him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did  --  did Agnes know you were coming ? ' she asked stupidly . Oh , yes , ' said Jimmy . I had lunch with her . I only decided to come this morning . ' Oh ! ' said Jane . Then after a tiny pause , I thought  --  ' I 've no doubt , ' said Jimmy cheerfully , that you shared allthose thrifty thoughts of Agnes 's about that milk train . But I say anything that 's worth doing at all is worth doing well . And I have n't been out of New York City for six years . ' Oh ! ' said Jane again . Jimmy continued to contemplate her with a sunny smile . I took this train , ' he said presently , because I thought we 'd have fun on it together . Do n't you think it 's time we began ? We 've lost almost an hour already . ' What  --  what do you want to do ? ' asked Jane , again rather stupidly . She felt totally unequal to coping with Jimmy . I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's nothing in all the world as much fun as talk . When you 're talking , that is , with the right person . ' Jane , still staring up at him , felt her features harden defensively . Jimmy burst into gentle laughter . Jane , ' he said , you look like a startled faun ! You need n't . Would it have been more discreet of me to use the plural ? Should I have said " the right people " ? I do n't like that phrase . It has an unfortunate social significance . ' Jane began to feel a little foolish . She laughed in spite of herself . Her laughter seemed to cheer Jimmy immensely . Curious , is n't it , ' he went on airily , that " talking with the right people " means something so very different from " talking with the right person " ? You are an awfully right person , Jane . No doubt you 're of the right people , too , but do n't let 's dwell on that aspect of your many charms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aisle all afternoon ? ' Having once laughed , Jane found it perfectly impossible to recapture her critical attitude . Where shall we go ? ' she asked . How about the back platform ? ' said Jimmy promptly . Or will the dust spoil that pretty dress ? '  |p289Mercy  , no , ' said Jane . Nothing could spoil it . ' The back platform was rather sunny and quite deserted . Jimmy opened one of the little folding chairs and brushed off the green carpet-cloth seat and placed it in the shade for Jane . He opened another for himself and sat down beside her . Jane looked out over the sparkling river . Is n't the Hudson beautiful ? ' she said . Do n't let 's talk about the Hudson , ' said Jimmy . Jane could n't keep from smiling as she met his twinkling eyes . What shall we talk about ? ' she said . I 'll give you your choice of two subjects , ' said Jimmy promptly . You or me ! ' In that case I think I 'll choose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jimmy . Shall I begin or do you , too , find the topic stimulating ? ' I think I 'd like to hear what you have to say for it , ' said Jane . It 's my favourite theme , ' smiled Jimmy . I 'll begin at the beginning . I was born in East St. Louis and I was raised in a tent . ' A tent ! ' cried Jane . Vague visions of circuses rose in her mind . Not the kind you 're thinking of , ' said Jimmy . A revivalist'stent . I 'm the proverbial minister 's son . My father was a Methodist preacher . ' Jane looked up at him with wide eyes of astonishment . My mother , ' went on Jimmy brightly , was a brewer 's daughter . Not the kind of a brewer who draws dividends from the company , but the kind who brews beer . My grandfather  --  so I 'm told  --  used to hang over the vats in person and in shirt-sleeves and my mother used to bring him his lunch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father was an itinerantp290revivalist . When my mother met him , he was running a camp meeting in , own , crusading against the Demon Rum . She met him in a soft-drink parlour and promptly got religion and signed the pledge . After that my grandfather had to eat a cold lunch and carry his own pail when he went to work in the morning . Mother would n't have anything more to do with the brewery . Father told her it was the Devil 's kitchen . That made quite a little trouble in the family , of course . My grandfather kicked my father out of the house a couple of times , but Mother was hell-bent to marry him , and so , of course , presently she ran off and did . That 's how I came to be raised in a tent . ' I do n't believe a word of it , ' said Jane . You 're making it all up . ' It 's Gawd 's truth , ' said Jimmy , and you do n't know the half of it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ H. G. Wells writes novels about . I ought to get in touch with him . He 'd pay me for the story of my life . I 'd make him one of those wistful , thwarted , lower-middle-class heroes  --  ' I know you 're lying , ' said Jane cheerfully , but go on with the story . ' You see , ' said Jimmy triumphantly , it holds you ! It would be worth good money to H. G. Wells . Well , I was raised in a tent , and before I was six I knew all about handing out tracts and passing the plate . All about hell-fire , too . I believed in a God who was an irascible old gentleman with belligerent grey whiskers and in a bright red Devil with a tail and a pitchfork . I thought Father was God 's ablest lieutenant on earth and Mother was His most trusted handmaiden . Mother loved music and she learned to play the melodeon at the camp meetings . By the time I was ten I was equally expert with the drum and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the Mississippi ValleyP29Iwith our tent , keeping up a guerilla warfare with the Devil , and , until I was fifteen , I really thought the chances were about a hundred to one that I 'd burn through eternity for my sins . ' There was a note of real emotion in his voice . Is this actually true ? ' asked Jane . You bet it is , ' said Jimmy . But at fifteen I met a girl . I met her on the mourner 's bench , singing " Hallelujah " with the rest of the saved . She fell off it pretty soon and I kept on seeing her . She was a bad egg , but she taught me more than you can learn at a camp meeting . By the time we moved on to the next town , I 'd lost all real interest in fighting the Devil . I took a pot shot at him now and then , but most of the time I declared a neutrality . I did n't state my views to Father , of course , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracts and the plate . He began to row with me a good deal and ask me questions about what I was doing when I was n't in the tent . I 'd skip a prayer meeting whenever I could and hang around the soda fountains and cigar stores . I used to long to steal money from the offering and run off to a burlesque show , but I never had the nerve to do it . Long after I 'd lost my faith in the Irascible Old Gentleman I used to feel a bolt would fall on me if I did a thing like that . When I was seventeen , I had my first real drink at a real bar , and when I came home Father smelled the whiskey on my breath . First he prayed over me and then he beat me . I snatched the cane away from him and broke it over my knee , and that night he prayed for me by name , in public , at the camp meeting . That finished religion for me . Mother tried to patch things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After six months of family warfare she gave up . I travelled around with them after that in the position of Resident Atheist . I never went to any more prayer meetings , but I was useful   putting up and taking down the tent and doing odd jobs backstage . Every now and then I 'd consent to drop in and play a violin solo while they were collecting the offering . I was just nineteen when my father died of pneumonia , caught preaching in the rain . And my mother and I went back to East St. Louis . Jane  --  your eyes are as big as saucers ! ' Why would n't they be ? ' cried Jane breathlessly . It 's perfectlythrilling . ' It was n't very thrilling while it was going on , ' said Jimmy . My grandfather was dead , but my grandmother took us in and my mother got me a job with my rich uncle . He lived across the river in St. Louis and he was a fashionable druggist . I worked in his shop for two years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I had money of my own for the first time in my life and I did n't have to hear any preaching . I went to night school at a settlement and I read all the books I could lay my hands on and pretty soon I turned socialist . That got my uncle 's goat right away . He was making a pretty good thing off the drug business and the established order was all right with him . He talked of Karl Marx just the way my father had of the Devil , and I was too young to have the sense to keep my face shut . I 'd air my views and he 'd call me an anarchist and I 'd say there were worse things than anarchy . I used to like to get him on the run . Pretty soon he really got to believe I had a bomb up my sleeve , and he was afraid to let me mix prescriptions any longer for fear I 'd add a little strychnine to the cough-mixture of a plutocratic customer . So he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . Mother thought I 'd better learn to run an elevator , but I did n't fancy a life in a cage and presently I got a job with myP293fiddle in a theatre orchestra . That nearly finished Mother , of course . She thought the stage was the Devil 's recruiting office . I lost the job pretty soon and got another through a man I knew at the settlement as a cub reporter on the " St. Louis Post-Dispatch . " That did n't last long either , but it made Mother 's last days happy to think I was through with the stage . She died when I was twenty-two and left me three thousand dollars saved from Father 's life insurance . The day after the funeral I took the train to New York and signed up with a vaudeville circuit as a ragtime accompanist for a black-face comedian . I guess I lost forty jobs in the next six years on newspapers and in orchestra pits . But I learned a lot about music and more about slinging the English language . I was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a card . She was the only woman I 'd ever met who was as good as my mother and as clever as I was . She took a fancy to ' reform me , though I told her at the time I 'd been immunizedto salvation from early childhood . After that , of course , it was all over but the shouting . ' It is like a novel , ' said Jane breathlessly . It 's just like a novel . ' But how does it end ? ' asked Jimmy , a trifle gloomily . It ended when you married Agnes , ' said Jane promptly . It is n't a fairy story , ' said Jimmy gently . H. G. Wells'snovels never end at the altar . ' Jane did not reply to that . She was watching the ruddy September sun sinking into the western haze behind Storm King . She was conscious of Jimmy 's eyes , fixed thoughtfully on her face . They sat a long time in silence . Jane could see the dim outline of the Catskills , pale lavender against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your novel , Jane ? ' he asked gently . Who wrote that ? '   Louisa M. Alcott , ' said Jane promptly . There 's nothing modern and morbid in my story . ' Now it 's my turn to be disbelieving , ' said Jimmy . Do I look morbid ? ' said Jane , turning to smile serenely into his admiring eyes . You look modern , ' said Jimmy . And you look very , very thoughtful . All people who think sooner or later go through hell . ' Then my hell must be ahead of me , ' said Jane steadfastly . You have n't even experienced a purgatory ? ' smiled Jimmy . Something you got in and got out of ? ' Not even a purgatory , ' said Jane . I 'm a very naive person . I 've never experienced much of anything . ' Perhaps that will be your hell , ' said Jimmy . The door behind them opened suddenly and Flora stood on the platform . Oh , here you are , Jane ! ' she cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tired . ' Then she recognized Jimmy . She had met him , of course , at that dinner at the Belmont . She looked very much astonished . Why  --  Mr. Trent --  ' she said uncertainly . Jimmy decided to come West on the Century , ' said Jane , rising from her chair . How nice ! ' said Flora , in her best Dresden shepherdess manner . Then to Jimmy with a smile , You 'll dine with us , of course ? ' I 'd love to , ' said Jimmy . They all walked together into the observation car . Flora looked distinctly cheered at the thought of a little male companionshipother than Mr. Furness 's . Jane was thinking of Jimmy 's story . How fairy-like and fantastic it was compared to her own ! By what different roads they had travelled to reach that intimate moment of companionship on the backP295platform of the Twentieth Century Limited . Having met at last , it seemed very strange to Jane that they could speak the same language . But yet they did . Jimmy , holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of him , smiled down into her eyes . She thanked him with an answering smile . Jane felt as if she had known Jimmy for years . The Twentieth Century was pulling slowly into the La Salle Street Station . Jane stood in the vestibule , knee-deep in luggage , looking eagerly for Stephen beyond the little crowd of porters that lined the greasy platform . Jimmy was at her elbow , but Flora and Mr. Furness were still sitting in the compartment . Mr. Furness found crowds very tiring . The train came slowly to a standstill . Jane tumbled down the steps , stumbling over suitcases . She looked quickly down the long vista of the trainshed . The platform was crowded , now , with red caps galvanized into action and with travellerstrying- to Fort out their bags from the heaps of luggage piled at each car entrance . No Stephen was to be seen . Jimmy was watching her with his ironical smile . He 's forgotten you , ' he said presently . He is n't here . ' He always meets me , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ met me every time I 've come home . ' What an idyll ! ' smiled Jimmy . It did n't seem impertinentbecause of the smile . Suddenly Jane saw Stephen . She saw his grey Fedora hat towering over the heads of the crowd . Oh  --  Stephen ! ' she called , her voice lost in the uproar of the trainshed . He saw her waving arm , however . In a moment he was at her side . Jane cast herself into his arms . She knew Jimmy was watching them . She pressed her cheek against the rough tweed of Stephen 's coat lapel , then turned her face to his . She felt a trifle histrionic , under Jimmy 's ironical eye . Stephen kissed her cheek , very tranquilly . Hello , Jane ! ' he said cheerfully . Your train 's an hour late . You can get a dollar back from the railroad . ' Jane wished his greeting had been a bit more idyllic . Jimmy was grinning now , quite frankly . Stephen , ' said Jane , this is Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whirl all the way from New York . ' Stephen looked over at Jimmy . He seemed a little surprised , Jane thought , at what he saw . Or perhaps it was at what she had said . She remembered her last words on Jimmy in the Boston South Station , eight days before , I know I 'll hate him . ' Jimmy had stepped forward and extended his hand . How do you do , sir , ' he said simply . His ultimate monosyllable struck Jane 's ear . She glanced from Jimmy to Stephen . Jimmy looked very casual and debonair . Stephen looked  --  well , Stephen looked just like what he was , the forty-four-year-old first vice-president of the MidlandLoan and Trust Company . Jane felt again that curious little pang of pity . Stephen had once looked quite as casual and as debonair as Jimmy . He was only ten years older than Jimmy that minute . Yet Jimmy had called him sir . ' And the worst of it was that it had sounded quite suitable . Flora and Mr. Furness had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , very warmly . They all trooped down the platform together and into the station , and over to the ticket window to collect their dollars . Jimmy pocketed his and turned to Jane with a smile . Could you have lunch with me ? ' he said . Meet me somewhereat one and show me the town . ' Oh , I could n't , ' said Jane . I have to go out to the country and have lunch with the children . ' P297Have dinner with the children , ' smiled Jimmy persuasively . I 'm a dollar in pocket and I 'd like to give you a time . ' I could n't , ' said Jane firmly . But I 'd like you to have lunch with Stephen . Stephen ! ' she called . He turned from the ticket window . Do n't you want to lunch with Jimmy at the University Club ? I 'd like him to meet people . ' Once more , Stephen looked just a little surprised . I 'd be glad to , ' he said , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet Bill Belmont there at noon . He 's on from New York to put through that Morgan deal . If Jimmy does n't mind talking of bond issues --  ' I 'm not awfully helpful on bond issues , ' said Jimmy self deprecatingly . And I 'm afraid I could n't get off at noon . I 'll be busy with the boys at the " News . " Thanks ever so much , though . ' They all turned away from the ticket window to the taxi entrance . Jane was solemnly reflecting that Jimmy was outrageous . She felt very thankful that Stephen had not heard him invite her to lunch . Suddenly she heard his voice at her ear . And when am I going to see you ? ' said Jimmy . Jane had n't forgiven him . You must come out to Lakewood sometime , ' she said vaguely . For a night or a week-end . ' Oh , I 'll come out to Lakewood , ' said Jimmy . When you 're settled , ' pursued Jane politely , let me know where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you find a good boarding-house . ' Oh , I 'll give you a ring , ' said Jimmy . By this time Stephen had hailed a taxi . I wo n't go with you to the other station , ' he said . I 've got to run into the Federal Building . ' Jane stepped into the cab . Your mail 's on your desk , dear . Do n't pay the painter 's bill ' til I talk to you about it . '  | Jane nodded very brightly . She was once again conscious of Jimmy 's ironical eye . This time she would n't stoop to be histrionic . She waved her hand casually as the taxi started . Jimmy and Stephen , standing bareheaded on the curbstone , both smiled and waved cheerfully in reply . Their waves and their smiles were very different , however , reflected Jane , as the taxi turned into the traffic at the station entrance . P299THEY say it was n't a stroke , ' said Isabel , but of course it was . ' Mrs. Lester told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And Rosalie told me it was brain fatigue , ' said Isabel . I do n't know what Bert Lancaster 's ever done to fatigue his brain , ' said Mrs. Ward . Jane laughed , in spite of her concern for Muriel . They were all sitting around the first October fire in Jane 's little Lakewoodliving-room . Her mother and Isabel had motored out from town to take tea with her and they were all discussing , of course , Bert Lancaster 's sudden seizure at the Commercial Club banquet the night before . It must have been awful , ' said Isabel , falling over like that , right into his own champagne glass , in the middle of a speech . ' They say he was forbidden champagne , ' said Mrs. Ward . Dr. Bancroft 's wife told me that the doctor had warned him last winter that he must give up alcohol . ' Have some more tea , Isabel , ' said Jane . I ought n't to , but I will , ' said Isabel . At forty-one Isabel was valiantly struggling against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened her purse and taking out a small bottle dropped three tablets of saccharine into her cup . Of course he 's pretty young for a stroke , ' said Mrs. Ward . He 's fifty-five , ' said Isabel . He was fifty-five the third of August . ' P300It 's frightful for Muriel , ' said Jane . Oh , I do n't know , ' said Mrs. Ward . Perhaps it 's providential . Of course if he 's disabled If he lives , he will be , ' said Isabel . Sooner or later . If you have one stroke you always have another . ' Well , he may not live , ' said Mrs. Ward . He ca n't have any constitution to rely on after the life he 's led . ' What do you think Muriel would do , Jane ? ' asked Isabel . Do you think she 'd really marry Cyril Fortune ? ' I do n't know , ' said Jane . She was off at the " Scandals " with him when it happened , ' said Mrs. Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark my words , ' said Isabel , taking a piece of toast and scraping the buttered cinnamon off it , whenever Bert Lancaster dies , Muriel will marry the man of the moment the day after the funeral . Not that I think she 's really in love with Cyril . I never thought she was in love with Sam or Binky or Roger or any of them . ' Not even with Sam ? ' said Mrs. Ward . Not really , ' said Isabel with conviction . Rosalie always said she was n't . I think Muriel is really just in love with herself . It keeps up her self-confidence to have a young man sighing gustily around the home . But just the same , if Bert Lancaster dies to-night , I bet she marries Cyril Fortune beforeChristmas . ' Nonsense ! ' said Mrs. Ward . Muriel would do everything decently . She 'd stay in mourning for at least a year . She 'd have to show the proper respect for her son 's sake . ' They 've sent for young Albert , ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Well , I hope Muriel behaves herself while he 's here , ' said Mrs. Ward severely . He 's fifteen and he 's old enough to notice . ' P301'That 's just exactly , ' said Isabel dreamily , what you used to say of Flora . ' Well , she was old enough to notice , ' said Mrs. Ward , but I doubt if she ever did . Lily Furness had a curious magnetism . Somehow she always made you believe the best of her . ' Flora simply adored her , ' said Jane suddenly . I adored her , myself . ' Just the same , ' said Mrs. Ward , she had no principle . ' You do n't know , ' said Jane . Perhaps she went through hell . You ca n't help it if you 're not in love with your husband . ' Every wife with principle , ' said Mrs. Ward firmly , is in love with her husband . ' Mamma ! ' cried Isabel . Do n't be ridiculous ! How many wives are ? But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do n't have to take a lover ' No , ' said Jane , of course you do n't . But I can see how you might . ' Do n't talk like that ! ' said Mrs. Ward sharply . I do n't know where you girls get your ideas ! When I was your age I would n't even have said those words  --  " take a laver " ! And you two sit there talking as if it were actually donr ! ' But it is done , Mamma , ' said Isabel . Not very often , of course , but sometimes . Lily Furness did it , even in your day . And you know , in your black heart , that you 're wandering whether Muriel has n't gone and done it in ours . ' I am not ! ' said Mrs. Ward indignantly . I should n't think of making such an accusation against Muriel . All I say is , she is n't very discreet . She gets herself talked about . There 's been a lot of gossip about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so much smoke , there 's bound to be some fire . ' Well , what do you think you 're saying now ? ' said Isabel What are , or are n't you , accusing Muriel of this minute Mrs. Ward looked slightly bewildered . I do n't like the way young people speak out nowadays , ' she said . And I do n't like your attitude toward wrongdoing . You and Jane are both perfectly willing to condone whatever Muriel has done . At least , in my day , we all made Lily Furness feel she was a guilty woman . We took the marriage vows seriously . ' I take the marriage vows seriously , Mamma , ' said Jane gently . But I can understand the people who break them . At least , ' she added doubtfully , I think I can . I think I can understand just how it might happen . ' Any one could understand how it might happen in Muriel 's case , ' said Isabel . Bert 's a perfect old rip . There 's a certain poetic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Furness'sshoes ' Mrs. Ward rose with dignity from her chair . Come , Isabel , ' she said , I 'm going home . I 'm not going to listen to you girls any longer . I only hope you do n't talk like this before Robin and Stephen . It 's a woman 's duty to keep up her husband 's standards . ' Jane and Isabel burst into laughter . Robin and Stephen ! ' exclaimed Isabel . Imagine either of them on the loose ! ' They keep up our standards , ' said Jane , as she kissed her mother . Mrs. Ward still looked a trifle bewildered . Put on your heavy coat , ' said Jane , as they all turned toward the door . Do n't let her catch cold , Isabel . ' I wo n't , ' said Isabel . Mind that rug , Mamma . The floor is slippery . ' You girls think I 'm just an old lady , ' said Mrs. Ward , as Jane opened the front door . I wish you 'd both remember that I took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were old enough to give me advice . ' She climbed , a little clumsily , into the waiting motor.  |p303Give  my love to Papa , ' said Jane . And Isabel  --  when you telephone Rosalie , ask if there 's anything I can do for Muriel . ' I will , ' said Isabel . There probably will be . Muriel never does anything for herself . ' The car crunched slowly around the gravel driveway . Jane watched it to the entrance . Curious , she thought , the gap between the points of view of different generations . The facts of life were always the same , but people thought about them so differently . New thoughts , reflected Jane , about the same old actions . Was it progress or merely change ? Sex was a loaded pistol , thought Jane , thrust into the hand of humanity . Her mother 's generation had carried it carefully , fearful of a suddenexplosion . Her generation , and Isabel 's , waved it nonchalantlyabout , but , after all , with all their carelessness , they did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What if the next generation should take to shooting ? Shooting straight regardless of their target . As Jane entered the front hall , the telephone was ringing . She stood still , suddenly , on the doormat . That might be Jimmy , she thought instantly , and despised herself for the thought . Jane hated to think that she had been back in the Lakewood house for three weeks and that , in all that time , the telephone had never rung without awakening in her unwillingbrain the thought that it might be Jimmy . For Jimmy had never telephoned . He had vanished completely out of her life that morning in the La Salle Street Station . At first she had been only relieved to find that the voice , whoseverit was , trickling over the wire , was not his . Jane had been firmly determined to discipline Jimmy for that outrageous refusal to lunch with Stephen on the day of his arrival . But , as the days passed and she did not hear from him , her relief had been subtly tempered first with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with indignation . Jimmy ought to have telephoned . It was rude of him not to . She had really felt , after those intimate hours on the back platform of the Twentieth Century , that she meant something to Jimmy , that he really liked her , that he was depending on her for support and diversionduring his visit to Chicago . And then  --  he had not telephoned . By not telephoning he had made Jane feel rather a fool . For Jimmy had meant something to her , she had really liked him . Of course he was irritating and she had known he was not to be counted on , but still  --  she had thought that she had read an honest admiration in his ironic eyes , she had felt that he was a very amusing person , she had even wondered just what she had better do in case Jimmy 's honest admirationbecame a trifle embarrassing . She had solemnly assured herself , on her arrival at Lakewood , that if she were firm and pleasantly disciplinary she could , of course , handle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband , but not very wise , perhaps , and obviously in the frame of mind in which he could easily be led astray by the flutter of a petticoat . And then  --  he had not telephoned . Mrs. Carver , ' Miss Parrot 's pleasant voice called down the stairs , Mr. Carver wants you on the wire . ' Jane walked to the telephone in the pantry . Yes , dear ? ' she said . I ca n't get out for dinner this evening , ' said Stephen . Muriel wants me to come up and talk business with her . It seems Bert was just advising her about some investments when he was stricken . She 's got some bonds he wanted her to sell immediately . ' Of course go , dear , ' said Jane quickly . Stephen would be . very helpful to Muriel . Every one turned to Stephen when introuble . And Muriel had no one to advise her except FreddyWaters , her volatile brother-in-law . Unless you countedp305Cyril Fortune , who was a young landscape gardener recentlyrumoured to have lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't be much to lean on in a financial crisis . I 'll be out on the ten-ten , ' said Stephen . Do n't be lonely . ' I wo n't , ' said Jane . I 've got letters to write . Give my love to Muriel . ' As Jane turned from the telephone she heard the whirr of a motor . That would be the children coming home from school . The car called for them at the playground every afternoon at five . Jane was always afraid to let them walk home alone through the traffic . The country lane on which her house had been built , fourteen years before , had long since become a suburban highroad . As she entered the hall again , they burst in at the front door . The cocker-spaniel puppy tumbled down the stairs to meet them . Mumsy ! ' called Jenny . Oh , there you are ! I 've made the basket-ball team and I need some gym shoes ! ' I 'm going to take my rabbits to school for the Animal Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Belle to come out on Saturday ? ' said Cicily . Jack and Belle were Isabel 's seventeen- and thirteen -- year-old son and daughter . No week-end was complete withoutthem . When can we get the gym shoes ? ' said Jenny . I need a cage for the rabbits , ' said little Steve . I 've got to have the gym shoes by Monday , Mumsy , ' said Jenny . Do you think I could make a cage out of a peach crate ? ' said little Steve . Hush ! ' said Jane . Pick up your coat , Jenny , and hang it in the closet . Steve  --  your books do n't belong on the floor .   Yes , Cicily , you can telephone Aunt Isabel to-night and ask them . ' Mumsy , where can I find a peach crate ? ' Be quiet ! ' said Jane . Now go upstairs , all of you , and wash ! If you get your home work done before supper , I 'll read King Arthur stories to you to-night . Daddy 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jane walked into the living-room with a sigh . They were terribly noisy . They never seemed to behave like other people 's children . She sat down at her desk and began to look over the afternoon mail . An invitation to dine in town with Muriel before an evening musical  --  that would be off , now , of course . A bill from the plumber for repairing the faucets in the maid 's bathroom . A note from the chairman of the Miscellaneous Committee of the Chicago Chatter Club asking her to write a funny paper on The Hand that Rocks the Cradle ' for the December meeting . A note from the chairman of the Literary Committee of the Lakewood Woman 's Club , asking her to write a serious paper on Oriental Art ' for the Spring Festival . A bill from the Russian Peasant Industries for smocking Cicily 's and Jenny 's new winter frocks . A notice from the Lakewood VillageCouncil , announcing that Clean-Up Week began on Monday next . A note from Steve 's teacher , suggesting that she see that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a Rummage Sale for the benefit of Saint George 's Church . A bill from the Lakewood Gas and Coke Company for the new laundry stove . A notice that her report would be due as chairman of the Playground Committee at the annual meeting of the Village Improvement Society next Wednesday night . Jane pushed the mail into a pigeon-hole . She felt she could not bear to cope with it . She felt she could not bear to copeP307with the winter that lay before her . Which was , of course , ridiculous . Jane knew that it would be just like all other winters  --  fun enough , when you came to live it . But always in October , reestablished in Lakewood after the break of the Eastern summer , Jane wondered why she and Stephen chose to live just the way they did . Lakewood was good for the children , of course . No longer country , not much more rural than the Pine Street of her childhood , but better than Isabel 's town apartment , nicer , even , than Muriel 's smart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty awful . Narrow , confining , in spite of the physical asset of its wider horizons . Jane rose from her desk and walked to a western window . The sun was setting over the Skokie Valley . An October sunset , red and cold , behind her copper oak woods , beyond the tanned haystacksin the distant meadows . A western sunset , violent and vivid , glorifying the flat swamps with golden light , setting the tranquil clouds in the wide , unbroken sky aflame with rosy fire . The Skokie always looked like that , on autumn evenings . It was lovely , too , on winter nights , a snowy plane beneath the sparkling stars . In the spring , when the Skokie overflowed its banks and the swamps were wet and the moonlight paled the pink blossoms of the apple tree at the foot of the garden , it was perhaps most lovely of all . Jane was lucky to live there  --  lucky to have that picture to look out on , always , outside her window . StillJane watched the burnished sun sink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their colour and turn darkly purple , the high clouds flame with pink and pure translucent gold . Then they , too , faded into wisps of grey . The western sky was lemon-coloured now . A crescent moon was tangled in the oak boughs . Jane luminated quotation from Stevenson that hung over it in a silver frame  --  the work of Jenny 's hand in the sixth grade of the Lakewood Progressive School , a gift of last Christmas . To make this earth , our hermitage , A cheerful and a changeful page , God 's bright and intricate deviceOf days and seasons doth suffice . ' What a damn lie ! ' thought Jane , and turned at the sound of a step in the doorway . Jimmy Trent , his hat in his hand , his fiddle-case under his arm , stood smiling at her on the threshold . The children had left the front door open , of course . He had come in quietly Hello ! ' said Jimmy . How 's every little thing ? ' Jimmy ! ' said Jane . Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see you ! ' That 's quite as it should be , ' said Jimmy . May I stay to dinner ? ' Of course , ' said Jane . Then , before she could stop herself , Why did n't you telephone ? ' Why did n't you telephone me ? ' said Jimmy , tossing his hat on a table and placing the fiddle-case beside it . You could have , you know , at the " Daily News . " ' Jane thought her reason for not telephoning Jimmy might sound a little foolish . If you said you thought a man should telephone you first , it really seemed as if you took the fact that he had not telephoned quite seriously . Oh , I do n't know , ' said Jane ; I 've been busy . ' So have I , ' said Jimmy . Awfully busy . It 's the first time in six years that I 've cut loose from a woman 's apron strings in a big city . I like Chicago . ' Do you like your job ? ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and just a little tired.  |p309My  job ? ' said Jimmy . Oh , yes . I like my job . It is n't very arduous . ' I hope you 're working at it , ' said Jane . Now , Jane , ' said Jimmy sweetly , lay off salvation . I get enough of that at home . ' He strolled over to the hearthrug and took his stand upon it , his back toward the smouldering fire . He was still smiling . I met Stephen at noon to-day . I met him , I regret to tell you , Jane , in the University Club bar . Every one was talking about this Lancaster 's stroke . Stephen said he was going up to see Mrs. Lancaster this evening . So I thought I 'd come out with my fiddle and offer you a little entertainment . I want to play you Debussy 's " La Fille aux Cheveux de Laine . " ' How nice of you , ' said Jane a little uncertainly . Like Debussy ? ' asked Jimmy . Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy . There was a moment of silence . Jane suddenly realized how dark the room had grown . She turned on a lamp and sat down in her chair by the fireside . This is nice , ' said Jimmy . This is very nice . ' He was lookinginterestedly around the chintz-hung living-room . The panelled walls , the books , the Steinway , the few good pieces of mahogany furniture all seemed to meet with his approval . It 's just like you , Jane . Modern , but not morbid . ' He sank into Stephen 's armchair across the hearthrug and picked up the October Question Mark ' from the table at his elbow . The Question Mark ' was the monthly magazine of the LakewoodProgressive School . Jimmy idly scanned a photograph of the football squad for a moment in silence and dropped the Question Mark ' back upon the table . His eye fell upon the copy of the King Arthur stories . Not at all morbid , ' he repeated . His eyes were twinkling as they met Jane 's .   I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , rising suddenly . Here 's the newspaper if you 'd like to read it until I come down . ' Are you glad I came ? ' The question arrested her abruptly in the doorway . Curiously enough , Jane was not quite sure . ButVery glad , ' said Jane evenly . She mounted the staircase rather slowly . She was n't quite sure about the gladness . Nevertheless , she was inexplicably determined to look her best that evening . She would put on that red Poiret teagownshe had so foolishly bought at a bargain sale last June . She had often regretted that folly . What use had Jane at Lakewood or Gull Rocks for a red Poiret tea-gown ? Miss Parrot , ' said Jane , pausing in the playroom doorway , I want Steve to wear his blue suit this evening . And tell Cicily and Jenny , please , to put on their new yellow smocks . ' On entering her bedroom she rang for the waitress . Sarah , ' she said , Mr. Carver will not be home for dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And some of the good sauterne at table . And creme de menthe , please , after the coffee . Be sure and see that the ice is cracked fine . You can pound it in a towel . It ought to be almost pulverized . ' Jane walked slowly to her closet and took out the red teagown . Jimmy was something different at Lakewood . Still , she was n't quite sure about the gladness . She wished that Agnes were downstairs with him . When Jane realized how much she wished that , she felt better about the gladness . She was even willing to admit to herself how very glad she was . Let 's play parchesi , ' said little Steve . I have to telephone Aunt Isabel , ' said Cicily . I have n't done my practising , ' said Jenny . P311They were all sitting around the living-room fire . Jane was presiding over the little silver coffee service on the table at her knee . Sarah was passing the creme de menthe . The little cut-glass goblets , filled with vivid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the small silver tray . Jimmy grasped his with a sigh of satisfaction . Miss Parrot took hers with the deprecatory gesture of every trained nurse accepting an alcoholic beverage . Jane sipped hers with the comforting realization that the ice was perfectly pulverized . Do you like parchesi ? ' said little Steve to Jimmy . I love it , ' said Jimmy , but I hurt my finger yesterday and I 'm afraid I could n't throw the dice . ' Anyway , ' said Jenny , I have to practise . ' Not to-night , ' said Jimmy cheerfully . Day before yesterdayI hurt my ear and sudden noises pain it dreadfully . ' Jenny and Cicily and Miss Parrot all laughed uproariously at his nonsense . Well , ' said Cicily , I do have to telephone Aunt Isabel . ' That 's a fine idea , ' said Jimmy approvingly . And Miss Parrot looks to me like a perfect parchesi fan . I think it would be very nice , Cicily , if Steve got the board all ready in another room so that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she and Jenny and Steve could all play parchesi together , while your mother sat here in the firelight and told me what to do for my finger and my ear . ' Miss Parrot , having finished her creme de menthe , rose with a smile . She was obviously quite captivated by Jimmy . Come up to the playroom , children , ' she said . I ' 11 play parchesi with you . ' And do n't I have to practise ? ' asked Jenny jubilantly . Not if Mr. Trent 's ear is hurting him , ' smiled Jane . Jenny threw Jimmy a grateful smile . Steve dragged MissParrot from the room . Cicily followed with Jenny .   I ca n't believe , ' said Jimmy , as he lit a cigarette , that those great children are yours . ' They are , ' said Jane briefly . Cicily 's a perfect heart-breaker , ' said Jimmy . I 'm afraid she will be , ' said Jane . Why " afraid " ? ' asked Jimmy . I do n't think breaking hearts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh  --  some one else can always mend them , ' said Jimmy lightly . He twinkled across at her , through a blue streak of cigarette smoke . You know that , do n't you , Jane ? ' I 've never broken any hearts , ' said Jane , smiling . So really I do n't . ' Well  --  experience is the best teacher , ' said Jimmy affably . Sarah reentered the room to remove the coffee tray . She picked up the cups and the little cut-glass goblets with the silent efficiency of the perfect servant and retired noiselessly into the hall . It moves on greased wheels , does n't it , Jane ? ' said Jimmy . What does ? ' asked Jane . Your life , ' said Jimmy . Yes , ' said Jane . But I grease them . ' I suppose you do , ' said Jimmy . But you do n't mind it , do you ? ' I get awfully sick of it , ' said Jane honestly . Jimmy watched her for a moment in silence behind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said presently . Sick , ' said Jane earnestly , of greasing wheels . Sick of runningthe house and bossing the servants and dressing the children . Sick of seeing that everything looks pretty and everything goes right . Sick of seeing that the living-room is dusted before ten every morning and that dinner is served on 3the stroke of seven every night . Sometimes I wonder what 's the use of it all . Sometimes I wish that Stephen and I could just tear up our roots and buy a couple of knapsacks and put the children in a covered wagon and start out to see the world . Just wander , you know , for a year or two . Wander everywhere , before we 're too old to do it . Not bother about anything . Not care . Not do anything we did n't really want toI suppose you think I 'm crazy ! ' She broke off abruptly . Crazy ? ' said Jimmy . I think you 're just right . There 's a lot of the nomad in me , you know . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd been born a gypsy instead of a Methodist minister 's son , I 'd never have broken home ties . Golly ! '  --  he waved his cigarette with enthusiasm  --  I 'd like to go round the world . Round and round it in circles . Round it in every latitude . Let 's do it , Jane ! Let 's surprise Stephen to-night ! You leave a note on the pincushion and I 'll send a wire to Agnes . " Gone  --  to points unknown ! " We 'll set out for the Golden Gate  --  I guess we can buy those knapsacks in the . Northwestern Station  --  and sail for the South Sea Islands and drift over to Siam and Burma and India and on up to China  --  and by that time Stephen and Agnes will have divorcedus and I 'll make you an honest woman , Jane , in a little Chinese shrine with the temple bells ringing overhead , and we 'll wander on , through Tibet and Afghanistan and Persia to Asia Minor , or maybe up to Russia , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be so nice , but where the food will be much better , to Africa , Jane ! To the Dark Continent . And maybe when we get there we 'll stay  --  stay in the village of some cannibal king who never even heard of a musicalcritic or a suburban housewife , where concertos for the violin are unknown and living-rooms are never dusted ! How about it , Jane ? ' He paused out of breath and looked engaginglyover at her.  | It sounds very alluring , ' said Jane , but a little uncom-fortable . ' Comfort ! ' scoffed Jimmy . You do n't really care about comfort ! ' Yes , I do ! ' cried Jane . When I have n't got it ! And so do you . I do n't know you so awfully well , Jimmy , but I know you well enough to know that . You care so much about comfortthat you wo n't get up in the morning and make your own bed for Agnes ! You wo n't ride on a milk train instead of the Twentieth Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a jungle . When I go to a jungle , I think I 'll take Stephen . He 'd be very capable there . ' I 'm sure , ' said Jimmy cheerfully , he 'd have sanitary plumbing installed in a fortnight . Nevertheless , something tells me that Stephen is no gypsy . If you ever see the Dark Continent with Stephen , you 'll see it in the discreet light shed on it by Thomas Cook and Sons ! But as for me , with or withoutAgnes , I 'm going to see the world before I die . ' Mumsy '  --  it was little Steve on the threshold  --  we want to kiss you good-night . ' Come in , ' said Jane . Come in , all of you . ' The three children were lingering in the doorway . How 'd the game come out , Steve ? ' asked Jimmy affably . Miss Parrot won , ' said Steve gloomily . She always does . ' I 'm going to send you a set of loaded dice , ' said Jimmy benevolently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' He rose as he spoke . I want to sing to you . ' He had picked up his fiddle-case and was removing the violin . Jane looked up in surprise . Jimmy was a strange mixture of contradictions . The children settled themselves delightedly on the floor near the fire . Jimmy tucked his violin under his chin and tuned it airily as he sauntered across the room . It 's an old English ballad , ' he said , and a particular fa-P315vourite of mine . It appeals to your mother , too , who is really a gypsy at heart . Did you know that , children ? There she sits by those polished brass andirons looking very pretty in a French tea-gown , but at heart she 's dancing barefoot by a bonfire in a tattered red shawl  --  dancing in the dark of the moon to the tinkle of a tambourine . When she married your father , children , she jumped over a broomstick . But later he took up with the bond business . That 's the way most of us get married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we nearly all of us take up with something else and after that we only use broomsticks to sweep with . ' The children were staring at him in wide-eyed fascination . They were still staring when he began softly to sing : ' There were three gypsies a-come to my door , And downstairs ran my lady , 0 ! One sang high and the other sang low , And the other sang bonny , bonny Biscay , 0 ! ' Then she pulled off her silk-finished gown And put on hose of leather , 0 ! The ragged , ragged rags about our door  --  She 's gone with the raggle-taggle gypsies , 0 ! ' Jimmy paused to smile mockingly at Jane , drawing his bow with a flourish across the strings of his violin . ' It was late last night when my lord came home , Inquiring for his lady , 0 ! The servants said , on every hand , She 's gone with the raggle-taggle gypsies , 0 ! ' Come saddle me my milk-white steedAnd go and fetch my pony , 0 ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is gone with the raggle-taggle gypsies , 0 !  |p316Then  he rode high , and he rode low , He rode through wood and copses too , Until he came to an open fieldAnd there he spied his lady , 0 ! What makes you leave your house and land What makes you leave your money , 0 ? What makes you leave your new-wedded lord , To go with the raggle-taggle gypsies , 0 ? ' Again Jimmy paused to smile mockingly at Jane and again his bow swept over a string and a note of triumph quivered inthe air . Oh , what care I for my house and land , And what care I for my money , 0 ? What care I for my new-wedded lord , I 'm off with the raggle-taggle gypsies , O ! ' His bow ran wildly , jubilantly over the high strings , then dropped to a sombre note of accusation . Last night you slept on a goose-feather bed , With the sheet turned down so bravely , 0 ! But to-night you sleep in a cold open field , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bow fluttered over the strings . The recreant lady 's laughter seemed tinkling in the room . Oh , what care I for a goose-feather bed , With the sheet turned down so bravely , 0 ! For to-night I shall sleep in a cold open field , Along with the raggle-taggle gypsies , O ! ' He dropped his bow abruptly . In the sudden silence Steve 's voice rang out shrill with interest . And did she ? ' That lady did , ' said Jimmy gravely . She had the courageof her convictions . ' And she never went back ? ' pursued Steve eagerly . P317Oh  --  that I ca n't tell you , ' said Jimmy gaily . The song does n't say . I should n't be surprised if she did , though . Lots of ladies do . ' Children  --  you must go to bed , ' said Jane . It 's very late . ' I must go back to town , ' said Jimmy . He was putting the violin away in its case . Must you ? ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I must , ' said Jimmy . But we have n't had any Debussy , ' said Jane . We 'll have him next time , ' smiled Jimmy . We 'll have Stephen next time , too , ' said Jane . That will be delightful , ' said Jimmy . The words might have seemed sarcastic if he had not been smiling so pleasantly . Suddenly , hat in hand , he crossed the room . He held out his hand to Jane . You must make Stephen like me , ' he said disarmingly . He will , ' said Jane . Looking up into Jimmy 's charming faun-like face , Jane , at the moment , could not imagine any one not liking him . I hope he will , Jane , ' said Jimmy . For I like you . ' Stephen always likes people who like me , ' said Jane loyally . Then that 's just as it should be , ' said Jimmy . When may I come again ? ' How about Tuesday ? ' said Jane . Come out to dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' said Jimmy . Good-night , kids ! Now , all together , before I go ! Do you like me ? The answer is " yes " ! ' In the resulting clamour Jimmy made his escape . He threw Jane one last smile from the threshold . As she heard the front door close behind him , Jane walked over to little Steve . For no reason whatever , she kissed him , very warmly.  | What are you smiling at , Mumsy ? ' said Jenny . Nothing , ' said Jane . She ran her hand caressingly over Cicily 's fair crinkly hair . She kissed Jenny 's little freckled nose and pushed her toward the door . Go to bed , now , all of you , ' said Jane . Left to herself , she picked up a book from the table and sat down in her chair to read it . She did not open it , however , but sat softly smiling , her eyes upon the fire . Stephen found her , sitting just like that , when he came home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' he said from the doorway . And Muriel 's in fine shape . She 's taking everything very calmly . Young Albertgets home to-morrow ! ' Jane realized that she had not once thought of Muriel since she had left the telephone after talking with Stephen five hours before . She felt suddenly conscious-stricken . She jumped up to help Stephen off with his coat . I 'm glad , ' she said . Did you fix everything up for her ? ' Even now , Jane felt she was n't really thinking of Muriel . She did not give Stephen time to answer her question . Jimmy Trent was here for dinner , ' she said . Jimmy Trent ? ' Yes . He came out unexpectedly . He brought his fiddle and sang to the children . ' Can he sing ? ' Stephen was walking across the room to lock the glass doors that opened on the terrace . Yes . Quite nicely . He 's very amusing . Stephen Jane hesitated . Yes , ' said Stephen , fumbling with a door-latch . Jane did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her tongue to say Stephen , I think he 's falling for me . ' Then she remembered . She remembered the three weeks in which Jimmy had not telephoned . He was probably just getting a rise out of her that evening . Well  --  anyway , even so , he did not know that1 1 9he had got it . That was a comfort . Of course he was not falling for her . He was Agnes 's husband and , obviously , a - very volatile young man . Yes ? ' said Stephen again , turning from the window . Oh  --  nothing , ' said Jane . Stephen turned out the lights . If Bert lives , ' said Jane , we ought to ask young Albert out here for the week-end . It would relieve Muriel , and Cicily would love to have him . Jack and Belle are coming . ' All right , ' said Stephen . Jane preceded him up the staircase . The spell invoked by Jimmy was already evaporating . She was glad that she had not said anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman , thought Jane , as she slipped out of the Poiret tea-gown . Jimmy did not mean anything by all that nonsense . It was just his line . IIIIt happened just seven weeks later . It happened Thanksgivingafternoon , out beneath the apple tree beyond the little clump of evergreens at the foot of the garden . Jane was very much surprised when it did . The seven weeks had been full of incident . She had been seeing Jimmy quite often , of course . He had come out perhapsonce a week to dinner . She had lunched with him in town one day and gone with him to a concert that he had had to review for his paper . That was the only time , really , that they had been alone . He usually brought his fiddle when he came out to Lakewood and they had had lots of Debussy and a few more ballads . The children adored him , of course , and he had , somewhat to Jane 's surprise , made rather a hit with Stephen . Jimmy had made rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her mother and Isabel and Flora and Muriel , who had had him to dinner just as soon as Bert was pronounced out of immediate danger , and declared him charming  --  .  |p320much  too good , indeed , for Agnes . Mr. Ward had raised the only dissenting voice . And all he had said was , after Jimmy had spent an unusually scintillating evening at the Wards ' dinner-table , that Agnes deserved a better fate . Jane knew that her father would think almost any fate unworthy of Agnes . He had admired her since her first days at Miss Milgrim'sSchool . When pressed by his indignant daughters for further and more flattering comment , even Mr. Ward had admitted that Jimmy was very clever . He fitted delightfully in Jane 's most intimate circle . That was why she had asked him out for Thanksgiving luncheon with the family . Thanksgiving luncheon had been like all Thanksgiving luncheons  --  not very brilliant . There had been too much turkey and too many children to make for clever conversation around the groaning board . Mr. Ward had sat on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On either side of Stephen sat Mrs. Ward and Isabel . Robin and Miss Parrot and the five children filled up the centre of the table . They had eaten for nearly two hours and then had sunk in recumbent attitudes around the chintz-hung living-room . Suddenly , early in the afternoon , Jack Bridges had sprung to his feet and asked Cicily , rather sheepishly , to go for a walk . She had deserted the younger children immediately and , whistling to the cockerspanielpuppy , had started off with him across the terrace . Jane had watched Jack help her , with adolescent gallantry , to climb over the stile that led to the open meadows . She had smiled , a trifle wistfully , over Cicily 's budding coquetry . Cicily could have cleared that stile at a bound . While she was smiling , Jimmy had roused himself from lethargy . He too had been watching the children . " The younger generation is knocking at the door , " Jane , ' he had smiled . But they have the right idea . Come out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone for her hat and coat without a moment 's hesitation . Every one was staying on for supper . The children were playing jack-straws , and Stephen was talking politics with Mr. Ward and Robin , and her mother and Isabel were discussing Bert Lancaster 's paralysis , with an occasional digressionon Flora 's hat shop . She was not needed in the livingroomand she would love a long walk . They went out the terrace door and down the garden path and out into the fields in the opposite direction from the one which the children had taken . The November day was very cold and clear . The oak trees were already bare . The winter fields were brown . A high northwest wind was blowingacross the Skokie Valley . It was difficult to talk in the teeth of the gale , and they had covered nearly two miles over the uneven stubble before they said much of anything : Then they paused in the shelter of a haystack . We must go back , ' said Jane , trying to tuck her wind-blown pompadour under her felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walk was just what I wanted . ' I 'm all out of breath , ' said Jane . That last cornfield was rough going for an old lady . ' She drew in a great gasp of the bracing autumn air . Was it ? ' said Jimmy . You do n't look much older than Cicily this minute . Your cheeks are red and your eyes are bright and your mussy hair is pretty . That 's the true test of age for a woman . She 's young as long as she looks beguiling with mussy hair ! ' I look like a wild Indian , ' said Jane , still struggling with the pompadour . You ought to look at Cicily when the wind gets romping with her head of excelsior . ' That 's Jack Bridges ' privilege , ' said Jimmy . I 'm no cradle-snatcher. '  | Jane left the haystack and started to walk back across the cornfield . It was easier to talk , now , with the wind at their backs . Nevertheless , they did not say anything for several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home before dark . Jimmy broke the silence . Whose privilege was it , Jane , to look at you when you were Cicily 's age ? ' he asked . Jane started at the question . But she did not answer . I bet some one did , ' said Jimmy . Who was he , Jane ? ' Oh , ' said Jane vaguely , he  --  he was  --  just a boy . ' A broth of a boy ? ' questioned Jimmy . Did you get muchof a kick out of it ? ' Yes , I did , ' said Jane simply . Jimmy looked very much amused at her candour . We all do at that age , ' he said cheerfully . I 'll never forget the girl who fell off the mourners ' bench . ' Jane felt very indignant at the tacit comparison . Oh ! ' she said quickly . He was n't like that ! ' How do you know what she was like ? ' smiled Jimmy . I know she was n't like Andre , ' said Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean that Andre never taught you anything you could n't learn at a camp meeting ? ' queried Jimmy . Oh , Jane ! ' I mean that Andre was n't like any one  --  any one else I 've ever met , ' said Jane . My God ! ' said Jimmy , addressing the empty November sky . She never got over him ! I hope , ' he continued severely , that you confessed him to Stephen . ' Oh , I confessed him to Stephen , ' said Jane . Again Jimmy looked very much amused at her candour . Good girl ! ' he said approvingly . You must always confess them to Stephen . ' P323Jane thought that her mother would think that Jimmy was taking the marriage vows lightly . She almost thought so herself . There have n't been any others , ' she said severely . Do you expect me to believe that ? ' said Jimmy . Not really any others , ' said Jane . While there 's life there 's hope , ' said Jimmy . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jane ! ' said Jimmy . I do n't , ' protested Jane . I think clandestine love affairs would be horribly inconvenient . ' There are higher things than convenience , ' said Jimmy sublimely . Jane ignored his comment . And I think , ' she went on , they 'd be dreadfully smirching and soiling . And too terrible to look back on when they were over . They would be over , you know . You get over loving any one Oh ! ' said jimmy . You 've discovered that , have you ? ' No , I have n't ! ' said Jane quickly . I  --  I 've just  --  observedit . ' Jimmy chuckled quietly to himself . They walked nearly half a mile in silence . As they entered the garden , he resumed the conversation . You do get over loving any one , Jane , ' he said gently . But you do n't always regret that love in retrospect . ' Jane thought that sounded very sweet and understanding . Perhaps not , ' she said . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused for a moment beside the clump of evergreens . Jane looked up at him with a smile . They had had a nice walk.  |p324Jane  , ' said Jimmy suddenly , are you really as innocent as you seem ? ' Jane 's eyes widened in astonishment . Jimmy 's eyes were very bright . His breath was coming quickly and a funny excitedlittle smile twisted the corners of his mouth . You 're like a child , Jane , ' said Jimmy . An inexperienced child ! ' Jane still stared at him . Jane , ' said Jimmy suddenly , I 'm going to kiss you . ' And he caught her suddenly in his arms and turned her face to his . Jimmy ! ' cried Jane in horror . Jimmy ! ' His lips stopped her words . He kissed her long and ardently . Jane struggled in his arms . His cheek scratched her face . She pulled herself from his embrace and stood staring at him in the garden path . Oh , Jimmy ! ' she cried again . How  --  how could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end of the garden . She glanced quickly , fearfully , at the white clapboardfacade . The clump of evergreens hid the living-room windows . But was that Miss Parrot 's white sleeve in the playroombay above ? Jane felt suddenly overwhelmed with a sense of humiliation . She had been kissed  --  kissed like a pretty chambermaid in her own garden . She had glanced at her own front windows , fearful of a spying servant 's ironical eye . Jimmy , ' she said , I would n't have believed it of you ! ' He was looking down at her , now , still breathing rather quickly . The excited little smile still twisted the corners of his mouth . He looked more like a faun than ever , thought Jane , with an unconscious shiver . Will you please go back to Chicago , now , at once ? ' she said with dignity . Will you please go back without coming into the house ? ' Jimmy looked very much astonished . P325Why , Jane  --  Jane ' he faltered . Do you really mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jane . And I do n't want you to follow me . ' She turned abruptly away from him and walked up the garden path to the terrace , trying to put her face in order . She opened the terrace door and entered the living-room . The family were all still lounging about the fire . Where 's Jimmy ? ' asked Isabel . He 's gone , ' said Jane , turning her back on them to close the terrace door . He was n't staying to supper . He had to get back to the " News . " ' Lies , she thought contemptuously , lies , forced on her by Jimmy , forced on her by her own damnablelack of foresight ! She ought to have known what was coming . She ought to have prevented it . She turned from the door and faced the family tranquilly . What 's up , Jane ? ' asked Robin . You look like an avengingangel . Your cheeks are as red as fire . ' It 's just the wind , ' said Jane . More @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She raised her hands to rearrange her pompadour . As she did so , she rubbed her fingers violently across her mouth . She could still feel Jimmy 's lips there . She could feel his kiss , still vibrating through her entire body . Suddenly she caught her father 's eye . Mr. Ward was sitting comfortably in Stephen 's armchair beside the smouldering fire . Behind a cloud of cigar smoke he was watching his younger daughter very intently . Jane managed to achieve a smile . No one else was paying any attention to her whatever . Jane sat down on the sofa beside Isabel and tried to listen to what she had to say about the cubistic designs that Flora was painting on the wall of the old coach-house . Isabel thought they were very comic . Mrs. Ward thought they were hardly respectable . Mr. Ward continued to watch them all from behind the cloud of cigar smoke . Jane tried to look as if she had forgotten that kiss.  | Mrs. Lester 's living-room was in festive array for a very gala occasion . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered the room with Stephen and the children , she could not see her hostess , at first , in the crowd of people who were laughing and talking around the hearth beneath the Murillo Madonna . Mr. and Mrs. Ward were there , and Flora and Mr. Furness , and Isabel and Robin , and Rosalie and Freddy Waters , of course . Edith and her husband had come on from Cleveland for the celebration and Muriel had invited Cyril Fortune . Bert Lancaster was not yet out of his bed . Rosalie 's daughter was in school in Paris and Edith 's son was in Oxford , but young Albert was there , home from Saint Paul 's for the Christmas vacation , so Isabel had brought Jack and Belle and Jane had brought Cicily and Jenny and little Steve . It was little Steve 's first dinner-party . The children were to eat at a separate table in a corner of the dining-room . Mrs. Lester was sitting in her wheel-chair on one corner of the hearthrug . Enormously fat and somewhat crippled with gout , she had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , great gay parties , and was pushed to the head of her dining-room table to preside over them with all her old-time gaiety . Her three dark-haired daughters and their attendant husbands had never ceased to flutter about her . They were n't dark-haired any longer , of course : Edith was really white-headed , slim , worn , and distinguished at forty-three . Pretty Rosalie was growing grey , and even Muriel had one white Whistler lock , that she rather exploited , in the centre of her dark pompadour . Mrs. Lester herself , with her straight snow-white hair , her wrinkled , yellow face , and her great gaunt nose hooked over her ridiculous cascade of double chins , had come to look much more Jewish withp327advancing years . In spite of her invincible gaiety , her large dark eyes , with yellow whites , were shadowed with racial sadness . No eyes , thought Jane , were ever as beautiful as Jewisheyes . Mrs. Lester 's had always touched her profoundly . They were twinkling now , up at Mr. Ward , as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : American beauties nodded over her snowy head . Jane kissed her with real emotion . Then turned to Muriel . How is Bert to-night ? ' she asked . Oh  --  Bert 's fine , ' said Muriel easily . He 's going to sit up next week . They 've given him exercises for his arm . They think he 'll get some motion back . ' I see , ' said Isabel , at Muriel 's elbow , you asked Cyril to fill his place . ' Cyril 's always helpful , ' grinned Muriel shamelessly . He does what he can . ' Who else is coming ? ' asked Isabel interestedly . You 're still a man short . ' Jimmy Trent , ' said Muriel , smiling . I asked him for our Jane . ' Jane glanced casually at her father , then turned , to smell an American beauty , rather elaborately . She had not expectedthis . She had not seen Jimmy since she had turned away from him , five weeks before , under the apple tree in the Lakewood garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not gone to the telephone . He had not written , for which fact Jane was devoutly thankful . She felt somehow very unequal to answering that unwritten letter and still more unequal to the melodramatic gesture of sending it back unread . She had known , of course , that she would have to meet Jimmy sometime , but she had not anticipated that meeting at Mrs. Lester 's seventy-fifth birthday-party . She was wonderingjust how to handle it when Jimmy appeared at the living-room door.  | Muriel moved quickly to meet him and Jane slipped quietly away from Mrs. Lester 's side before he came up to present his compliments . She began talking to Freddy Waters in a great burst of gaiety . In a moment the butler appeared at the dining-room door . He announced dinner and moved to push Mrs. Lester 's chair in to the table . Almost immediatelyJane heard Jimmy 's voice at her elbow . I found your name in my envelope in the dressing-room , Jane , ' he said , and you can bet your life I was glad to see it there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His eyes , however , looked very serious . Freddy Waters had gone off in quest of Isabel . The dinner-party was passing into the dining-room , two by two . Jane rested her finger-tips on Jimmy 's black broadcloth sleeve . She felt there was nothing whatever to say to him . Jimmy looked anxiously down at her as they joined the little procession . Jane saw her father watching them as he offered his arm to Edith . Mr. Furness had gone in with Mrs. Lester . Ca n't you forgive me , Jane ? ' asked Jimmy earnestly , as they entered the dining-room . I do n't know , ' said Jane . I still do n't understand at all how you could have done such a thing . ' Do n't you , Jane ? ' said Jimmy wistfully . Do n't you , really ? ' I do n't understand how you could have done it to me , ' said Jane . I did n't know , ' said Jimmy , pulling out her chair for her as they reached the table  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously . ' Jane seated herself in silence . I 've taken it seriously myself , ' said Jimmy , since I did it . ' He sat down at her side . I 'm very glad to hear it , ' said Jane severely . P329And you 'll forgive me ? ' said Jimmy . I do n't know , ' said Jane again . She turned to look into his contrite eyes . There was something irresistibly funny about a penitent faun . Jane could not help smiling . Jimmy drew a long breath at the sight of her smile . You have forgiven me ! ' he said triumphantly . Jane saw her father looking at him from across the table . She wished that Jimmy had not spoken quite so loudly . Then despised herself for the wish . Do n't let 's talk about it any longer , ' she said evenly . It happened , and I wish it had n't . But it does n't do any good to go on harping on it . ' I do n't want to harp on it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to harp on anything you do n't want to hear . ' He was looking at her now , with just the same old look of friendly admiration . Let 's talk about the weather . ' They did , with mock solemnity . Then they talked of other things . Of Jimmy 's reviews , which were making quite a sensation in the Daily News ' ; of Agnes 's play , which was alreadyhalf-written ; of Cicily , shaking her dandelion head at Jack at the foot of the children 's table ; of Mrs. Lester , noddingher white one at Mr. Furness at the head of theirs ; of the charms of fourteen and of the charms of seventy-five . Jane was quite sorry when Mrs. Lester turned the conversation at the beginning of the salad course and she had to begin to talk to Edith 's husband of the charms of living in Cleveland  --  if there were any , which Jane very much doubted . Later , when the men joined the women in the living-room , Jane was rather surprised to find herself talking to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the green brocade sofa with a sigh of satisfaction . I do n't see enough of you , Kid , ' he said cheerfully . Nor enough of Stephen . What with all the grandchildren , I hardly spoke to either of you on Christmas Day . I 'm going to put in the evening catching up on what you 've been doing . ' ' I have n't been doing much , ' said Jane . Just Christmas shopping . ' Many town parties ? ' asked Mr. Ward . None in the holidays , ' said Jane . I 'm too busy with the children . ' Much company in the country ? ' No one but the children 's friends . ' ' Jimmy been out often ? ' Jane looked straight into her father 's eyes . He has n't been out since that luncheon on Thanksgiving Day , ' she said . Mr. Ward settled back against the sofa cushions . What do you hear from Agnes , Kid ? ' he asked vMotoring out to Lakewood when the party was over , tuckedin beside Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children asleep in the tonneau behind them , Janefelt very happy over the events of the evening . She would not have believed it possible that she could have arrived so easilyat an understanding with Jimmy . He was obviously verysorry and she had made her attitude quite clear . Jimmyknew now that she was not to be kissed like a chambermaid , caught in an upper corridor . Jimmy knew now that she wasnot entertained by philandering . Jimmy knew now that shewas not that sort of wife to Stephen and that the idea of flirtingwith Agnes 's husband was , to her , unthinkable . Jimmyknew all those things , though they had not referred to hismistake again after they left the table . Jane had hardlyspoken to Jimmy all the latter part of the evening . Jane hadtalked to her father and Jimmy had hung devotedly over IMuriel . He had entered into open competition with Cyril Fortune for her favour and by the end of the party the blond young landscape-gardener was quite sunk in depression . Stephen had talked with his cousin Flora about her new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about cost accounting . Flora had told Jane she was very grateful . Flora was not much of a bookkeeper . How wise she had been , thought Jane , how very wise , not to have said anything to Stephen about that kiss . Not that wisdom had really entered into her decision to keep sildnt . In fact , all those weeks , when she had been wondering whether or no to talk to Stephen about it , she had felt that the wiser course would be to make a clean breast of the whole affair . And yet she had n't . Partly , of course , because of what Stephen would think ofJimmy , but even more because of what Stephen would think of her . Jane thought very little of herself , as she reviewed the incident . Jimmy had been outrageous  --  Jimmy had been insulting . Yet Jane could not quite bring herself to tell  --  the story to Stephen in the role of the betrayed damsel . Jane knew that she had been growing very fond of Jimmy . Jane knew that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though she had not expected his kiss and certainly had resented it , yet , after she had had it , she had not been able to get it out of her mind , out , indeed , of the very fibre of her being . That was the kind of thing a wife could not tell a husband  --  not a husband like Stephen , at least , who had never even glanced at another woman since the day he had married her . Stephen would never understand how she could have thought about that kiss , the way she had . And if she did not tell him that , she really would not be telling him anything . Half-truths had no place in conjugal confidence . Half-truths were cowardly , misleading . Half-truths were really lies . Whereas silence was  --  merely silence . No  --   |p332it  was not the kiss half as much as the way she had felt about it . What was a kiss , after all ? Lots of women were kissed . Some of them had told her about it . Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was the thinking something of it that really counted . Jane had been awfully troubled . But now , she felt , she had been very wise not to tell Stephen . The incident was over . It was forgiven and  --  well , if not yet forgotten , it soon would be . Jane hoped she was not going to spend the rest of her life remembering that Stephen 's wife had been kissed by Agnes 's husband and had liked it . Yes , liked it , in retrospect . Jimmy had learned his lesson . It would not happen again . Jimmy had not even asked when he might come out to see her . When he had said good-night , he had left her to interpretthe expression of his wistful eyes in silence . It was Stephen who had said in parting , How about dinner on Friday , Jimmy ? It 's fish night . You ought to taste Jane 's receipt for planked whitefish ! ' Even then he had not responded with a questioning glance at her . She had slipped her arm through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just a family party . ' And he had accepted without undue rejoicing . No grateful , penitent glances . Nothing to shame her before Stephen 's innocence . Jimmy knew , now . There would be no more mistakes in the future . Jane snuggled down against Stephen 's shoulder under the furry laprobe . He took his eyes from the road a moment to smile down into her face . Nice party , was n't it ? ' said Stephen . I had a lovely time , ' said Jane , smiling softly . She kept on smiling all the way to Lakewood . A sleepy , reassured , little smile . P333THE April sunshine was slanting in Jane 's open bedroom window . The pale , profuse sunshine of early April , flickering through the bare boughs of the oak trees . The crocuses were blooming in the garden . The daffodils nodded their yellow heads in the bed beneath the evergreens . The apple tree was an emerald mist of tiny budding leaves . Jane sat at the window , sewing a fresh lace collar in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parrot . From her chair she could see Jenny , swooping luxuriously up and down in the swing beneath the apple tree , and hear Steve , concealed in the upper branches , clamouring vociferouslyfor his turn . I really hate to leave him , ' said Miss Parrot . But he 'll be all right now , Mrs. Carver , if you just watch him a little . Do n't let him race around too much this summer . And of course no competitive sports . ' Jane nodded , over her sewing . She was awfully glad , of course , that little Steve 's heart was really so much better , but almost gladder , she thought with a smile , that she would no longer have to talk to Miss Parrot at table , three times a day , or listen to her unasked advice on little Steve 's care . Of course , she had been wonderful . She was a very good heart nurse . Still , it had been irritating , having her around under foot all winter , a tacit critic of Jane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought . But it was over now . Little Steve had completely recovered . Dr. Bancroft had dismissed Miss Parrot . She was going in three days . You 'll see that he takes his tonic , ' said Miss Parrot.  |p334Of  course , ' said Jane , with a hint of irritation in her voice . Well , I hope Sarah remembers it when you 're out , ' said Miss Parrot , with a sigh of resignation . Jane looked up from her sewing at Miss Parrot 's starched , immaculate figure . She met her pleasant , impersonal eye . She wished dispassionately that she could push Miss Parrot out of her bedroom by main force . Suddenly Sarah appeared in the doorway . Mr. Trent to see you , madam , ' she said impassively . Jane jumped to her feet . Mr. Trent ? Downstairs ? ' Jane glanced at the little French clock on the mantelpiece . It pointed exactly to three . Jimmy had said he was taking the three-nineteen . He was an hour ahead of time . She thrust her sewing into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said hastily , just baste this collar in for me , will you ? As quickly as you can , please . I 'm wearing it this afternoon . And , Sarah  --  I want tea in the living-room at four . We wo n't wait for Mr. Carver . Toast , please , and anchovysandwiches , and some of that sponge cake we had at luncheon . ' She was already slipping out of her morning gown . Tell Mr. Trent I will be down immediately . ' Sarah turned from the door . Jane sat down hastily at her dressing-table and began to take down her hair . Miss Parrot had seated herself at the window and was picking up Jane 's thimble . Jane could catch her reflection in the slanting plane of the cheval glass , near the dressing-table . She was looking at Jane with a faint smile of cynical amusement . Her eye was no longer impersonal . Jane hated Miss Parrot , at the moment . She hated herself for that question she had never been able to answer  --  had that been Miss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Thanksgiving afternoon when Jimmy She pushed in the last hairpin and rose to her feet . P335Ready , Miss Parrot ? ' she said evenly . Yes , ' said Miss Parrot , handing her the gown . She lingereda moment , to put away the thimble and close the sewingbox . Again she looked Jane over with that not impersonaleye . You look very pretty , Mrs. Carver , ' she said . Jane dabbed a little perfume on her cheeks and hurried from the room without answering . In the hall she stumbled over the children 's cocker spaniel . It yelped sharply , then wagged its tail and started after her down the stairs . At the foot of them Jane saw Belle , just starting up for Cicily 's room . She and Jack were coming out for the week-end . They must have been on the train with Jimmy . The child looked up at her with wide , round eyes of admiration . The eyes were so round and the admiration so apparent that Jane stopped and laughed down at her . Belle was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , little Belle , ' said Jane . At the sound of her voice , Jimmy Trent came out of the living-room . He looked taller than he really was , beside the staring child . His eyes were very bright and blue and his necktieexactly matched them . He stood smiling up at her from the foot of the staircase . As Jane ran down the last steps , he took her hand and held it fora minute . Jane laughed up at him . You know little Belle Bridges , ' she said , withdrawing her hand . Of course I do , ' said Jimmy . Hello , little Belle Bridges ! ' He too smiled down at the child . Jane stooped over and kissed little Belle 's cheek . It felt very smooth and cool , like the petal of an apple blossom . The little spaniel was jumping forgivingly about her feet . Jane picked it up and held it tenderlyin her arms and kissed the top of its little black head and looked up at Jimmy over its long , floppy ears . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .   I did n't expect you ' til four , ' said Jane , smiling up at Jimmy over the spaniel . He paused to let her precede him through the living-room door . I could n't wait to play you my last cadenza , ' said Jimmy . Jane , that concerto is finished . I could n't wait an hour Silly ! ' said Jane , looking over her shoulder at Jimmy , as they passed into the living-room . In a moment she heard little Belle , scrambling upstairs to Cicily 's bedroom . But I ca n't wait myself to hear it . Oh , Jimmy , I ca n't believe  --  truly I ca n't believe  --  that you 've really done it . ' You know who made me , ' said Jimmy . His eyes searched hers for a moment , before he turned to pick up his fiddle-case from the table . It 's really your concerto . ' He tucked his violin under his chin and tuned it airily as he strolled across the room , just as he had done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the hearthrug , bow in hand , and looked down at her . Your concerto , Jane , ' he repeated . It seemed to Jane , at the moment , a very solemn dedication . She looked up at Jimmy very seriously as he raised his bow . She never took her eyes off his slender , swaying figure , until the last note had sounded . It 's beautiful , Jimmy , ' she said then , solemnly , it 's very beautiful . ' You know why , do n't you ? ' said Jimmy , looking down at her from the hearthrug . Just then Sarah came in with the tea . IIYou would n't think it was so funny , ' said Isabel scathingly , if you 'd heard Muriel talking about it yesterday in Flora 's hat shop . She did n't even stop when I came in . ' P337I do n't think it 's funny , ' said Jane loftily . I think it 's ridiculous . ' Muriel ought to be ashamed of herself , ' said Mrs. Ward . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ library , waiting for Minnie to bring in the tea-tray . She said it was as plain as a pikestaff , ' said Isabel . She said it right before me . She said that just as soon as she and Flora came in they saw you two sitting over at a corner table . She said that you had a quart of champagne , Jane , and that you said something and that Jimmy smiled and lifted his glass and looked at you and kissed the rim before he drank from it . ' It was only a pint , ' said Jane . We were drinking to the success of his concerto . He finished it last week . ' It was very unfortunate , ' said Mrs. Ward , that Muriel had to come in at just that moment . ' It was very unfortunate , ' said Isabel severely , that Jane had to be there at all . If you want to lunch with him , Jane , why ca n't you lunch at the Blackstone or the Casino as if you 'd like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ De Jonche 's where no one you know ever goes ' We did n't sneak , ' said Jane hotly . And we go to De Jonche 's because we both like snails . They have the best in town . ' You go ? ' said Mrs. Ward . Had you been there before ? ' Often , ' said Jane briefly . When I was your age , ' said Mrs. Ward , it was as much as a young married woman 's reputation was worth to be caught lunching with a man who was not her husband  --  ' Oh , nonsense , Mamma ! ' interrupted Isabel . Every one lunches with men , nowadays . It all depends on how you do it . Of course , as for Jimmy 's kissing the rim of his champagne glass in a public restaurant  --  ' She stopped abruptly as Minnie came in with the tea-tray . Minnie loved familyp338gossip , but she was never allowed to hear any . Minnie had been twenty-five years in Mrs. Ward 's service , and in all those years Mrs. Ward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whenever she entered the room . I wonder where your father is ? ' she said now , in a note of hollow inquiry , as Minnie , wheezing slightly , placed the heavy silver tray on the tea-table . Minnie , at fifty-three , was rather plump and puffy . She had recently developed a chronic asthma . But she never allowed any one else to wait on Mrs. Ward . Hello , Minnie ! ' said Jane . Minnie smiled her acknowledgement of the greeting . How are the children , Mrs. Carver ? ' she asked . Then bending solicitously over Mrs. Ward . Do n't you eat too much of that plum cake , Mrs. Ward . It 's too rich for your blood pressure . ' Her cap slightly askew on her iron-grey hair , she made a triumphant exit . Does Minnie think plum cake sends up blood pressure ? ' smiled Jane . She 's really getting impossible , ' said Isabel . Sometimes I think she takes more interest in my condition than you children do , ' said Mrs. Ward . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sugar , Mamma , ' said Isabel . Then , returning to the charge , Well , Jane , I think you ought to cut it out . ' Cut what out ? ' said Jane angrily . Two lumps , Mamma . Cut out those clubby little parties a deux , with a pint of champagne . When Muriel starts talking She 's a good one to talk , ' said Mrs. Ward . Set a thief to catch a thief ! ' laughed Isabel . Oh , Isabel , shut up ! ' said Jane , in a sudden , snappish return to the vernacular of her childhood . She had not saidP339shut up ' to Isabel for more than twenty years . As the words left her lips , Mr. Ward entered the room . He came in just . as he always did , and laid the evening paper op his desk and began to turn over the afternoon mail . Hello , Kid ! ' he said tranquilly . Why must Isabel shut up ? ' Because she 's an ass ! ' said Jane , still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So are we all of us , ' he said pleasantly , sometimes . ' Then , running his paper-cutter through an envelope , What 's Isabel been doing now ? ' Talking , ' said Jane briefly . And listening . And repeating silly gossip . ' Mr. Ward looked as if he thought Isabel had merely been running true to form . That all ? ' he said , with a smile . I 've been telling Jane , ' said Isabel , that she 's getting herselftalked about . ' Oh ! ' said Mr. Ward . Lizzie , could you make me a cup of weak tea ? ' He dropped his mail and sat down in his leather chair , lowering himself into it rather carefully , his hands on the arms . It 's like summer out , ' he said pleasantly . Makes me think of the old days when I used to walk home from the office . The Furnesses ' lilacs are almost in bud . ' They do n't bud any more , Papa , ' said Jane . The soot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Ward . Thank you , Lizzie . The one by the old playhouse . ' It 's terrible , ' sighed Mrs. Ward , what 's happening to the neighbourhood . ' Jane knew just what her mother thought about what was happening to the neighbourhood . She walked over to the window and stood staring across Pine Street at the new flat building that had gone up in the opposite yard the previous autumn . Boarding-houses , ' said Mrs. Ward , and dressmakers and apartments ' Jane was no longer listening . She stoodstaring out of the window at the terra-cotta facade of the flat building , thinking furious thoughts about Isabel  --  and Muriel  --  and a world in which you could not phrase a funnylittle toast to a man 's concerto , without Presently she heard her father get up and go out of the room . Jane glanced at her watch . I must go , ' she said . I 'm motoring out to Lakewood . ' Are you picking up Stephen ? ' asked Mrs. Ward . No , ' said Jane . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheek . Good-bye , Isabel , ' she added coldly . Now , Jane  --  do n't be a dumb-bell , ' said Isabel cheerfully . You think over what I said . ' Jane left the room without stooping to further discord . In the hall she met her father . He was standing there , outside the library door , exactly as if he were waiting for some one . He slipped his arm through hers and walked to the front door . Jane opened it . Good-bye , Papa , ' she said . There was a note of finality in her tone . He followed her out onto the front steps , however . He stood a moment on the top one , gently detaining her by his restraining arm . Kid , ' said Mr. Ward , I know you 're a grown woman , but you seem just like a child to me . ' Jane smiled , a little nervously . She did not speak . But you 're a wise child , Kid , ' went on Mr. Ward , and I would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too smiled just a little nervously . Jane still stood silent . I ' 11 only trespass on the parental prerogatives so far as to urge you , ' said Mr. Ward , to avoid all appearance of evil . It 's a wicked world . '  |p341Pa|pa  , ' said Jane , I have n't been doing anything I should n't . ' I 'm sure you have n't , ' said Mr. Ward quickly . It 's just Muriel 's nonsense . You know Muriel . ' Yes , I know Muriel , ' said Mr. Ward . That 's why I urge you to avoid all appearance of evil . ' He stood looking steadily at Jane . The nervousness had left his smile . His eyes looked worried , however . His eyes looked tired , Jane thought . His eyes looked old . They seemed a darker brown since his hair had turned so white . Jane kissed him , tenderly . I will , Papa , ' she said . Do n't worry . ' Then she ran down the steps and jumped into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was still standing on the top step , looking after her with that faintly troubled expression . Jane forgot him as she set the gears in motion . Her thoughts returned , angrily , to Isabel . That luncheon was perfectly harmless . Muriel , of course , was always malicious , but Isabel ought to have more sense . Jane could not , however , keep her angry thoughts on Isabel . The April afternoon was very warm and fair . The elm trees were budding down the stretch of Pine Street . The bushes in the park around the Water Works Tower were already green . Jane saw the bench where she and Andre had sat to look at the pictures of Sarah Bernhardt . She remembered Muriel 's adolescent giggle . Muriel was an idiot , even then . The lake stretched , softly blue beyond the Oak Street breakers . A gaunt skyscraper or two loomed up on the filledinland to the southeast . A whole section of the city had been created there since Jane 's childhood . Created from garbage and tin cans @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the waste of empty land . Magnificent red-brick and grey-stone apartments , with liveried doormen and marble entrance halls and wrought-iron elevators , standing where once there had been only blue water . Blue water beyond the vacant lots where sweet clover and ragweed had bloomed . Jane felt like the first white child born west of the Alleghenies when she looked at them . She had seen Chicago change from a provincial town into the sixth largest city in the world . She turned the car abruptly from the Drive at the Division Street corner . She was going to pick up Jimmy at his North State Street boarding-house and motor him out to Lakewood for the week-end . They would have lovely weather . One more hot day like this , thought Jane , and perhaps the apple tree would burst into bloom . Jimmy was standing on the curbstone , his suitcase at his feet . Am I late ? ' asked Jane anxiously , as she brought the car to a standstill . No  --  I 'm early , ' said Jimmy . He opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . I thought maybe you 'd come sooner than you said . ' I was having tea with Mamma , ' said Jane , and talking to Isabel . ' She set the gears in motion . What about ? ' asked Jimmy . Oh , nothing , ' said Jane . Nothing much . ' Suddenly she decided to tell him . Muriel told Isabel about seeing us at De Jonche 's yesterday , ' she said , her eyes on the street before her . What was there to tell ? ' asked Jimmy innocently . Oh  --  Muriel can always make a good story , ' said Jane . There was a little pause . Jane knew Jimmy was looking at her profile . Well  --  do you care ? ' asked Jimmy presently . Oh , no , ' said Jane falsely . No  --  not at all . Only ' She stopped . P343Only what ? ' asked jimmy gently . Only it seems too bad that people have to try to spoil lovely things . To  --  to smirch them , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopped . They ca n't spoil them really , Jane , ' said jimmy very seriously . No one could ever spoil what happens between you and me but just ourselves . ' That was just like Jimmy , thought Jane , smiling softly at the North State Street traffic . It was just like Jimmy to understand . He had perfectly phrased the thought she had been groping for ever since her angry altercation with Isabel . As long as she and Jimmy kept their heads and  --  well  --  did not allow anything  --  anything silly to happen , there was nothing in their friendship to be ashamed of . And it would so soon be over . Jimmy 's job at the News ' would be ended in a fortnight . His friend was on the water now , coming back from Munich . They had had a lovely winter  --  the loveliest winter , Jane thought , that she had ever known . Jimmy had written his reviews and had finished his concerto , and she  --  she had never been so happy , really , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , never so sure and satisfied , in her secret heart , that life was worth living , that it would always , somehow , be fun to live . There had been , of course , Miss Parrot 's cynical smile and Sarah 's impassive silence and Muriel 's malicious twinkle and her father 's troubled eyes . And now there was Isabel 's uncalled-forinterference . It was , as her father had just said , a wicked world . But she and Jimmy had never exchanged a word that she could be sorry for . Never said anything , really , that Stephen might not have heard . Stephen , himself , had never been troubled . Stephen liked Jimmy . Stephen knew she was to be implicitly trusted.  | And now jimmy was going  --  going in two weeks  --  back to New York to the Greenwich Village flat and the big and little Agneses . And Jane  --  Jane would be left in Lakewood to  --  to watch the spring come and buy the children 's thin clothes and clean the house and pack up for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of the months beforeher . Just like all other spring months , of course . But she would miss Jimmy dreadfully , and she would never see him again , of course , just as she had this last lovely winter . He would go back to New York and produce the concerto and become suddenly distinguished . Suddenly distinguished , really , a little bit because of her . Of course it was absurd of Jimmy to call it her concerto , but Jane knew that she had kept him working . Her encouragement and enthusiasm had spurred him on . Yes , both she and Jimmy would always be a little better for the winter 's friendship , which no one but themselvescould ever spoil . No one but themselves could ever understand it , really  --  a simple friendship that had meant so much to them , a joy of companionshipA penny for your thoughts , Jane ? ' said Jimmy . I was just thinking of us , ' said Jane , and of all that 's happened this winter . ' Have you really liked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' breathed Jane . Then , after a moment , It seems so funny , now , to think I did n't think I would , when Agnes first wrote me you were coming . I thought you 'd be terrible , Jimmy ' I am terrible , ' said Jimmy , with a smile . Oh , no , you 're not , ' said Jane very wisely . You do n't know the half of it , ' said Jimmy . Yes , I do , ' said Jane . I know pretty nearly the whole of it . I understand you perfectly . ' Sure you do ? ' said Jimmy.  |p345I  know you can do great things if you 're prodded by a little encouragement ' Say rather if I 'm prodded by " the endearing elegance of female friendship , ' said Jimmy , still with the smile . It does more for a man than you know . There 's a little lyric of A. E. Housman 's , Jane  --  I wonder if you remember it ?  --  it has always been a particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quoted lightly : Oh , when I was in love with you , Then I was clean and brave , And miles around the wonder grew How well did I behave . ' Well , ' laughed Jane a little confusedly , even so , what of it ? As long as you do behave , you know . ' There 's a second verse , ' said Jimmy warningly . And now the fancy passes by , And nothing will remain , And miles around they 'll say that I Am quite myself again . ' Jane felt unaccountably disappointed in the second verse . She summoned up a laugh , however . I call that cynical , ' she said . It wo n't be that way with you . As soon as you get to New York , Jimmy , you must show that concerto to Damrosch . I know he 'll like it . And you must write something else . Something else immediately , while you 're still in the mood for it . ' Perhaps I wo n't be in the mood for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if I 'd be much in the mood for anything when I get back to New York . ' You 've been working awfully hard , ' said Jane sympathetically . I liked what you wrote last week about Mischa Elman . You 're right . No other living violinist has his combination of warmth and light  --  of feeling , yet detachment  --  ' P346They talked of Mischa Elman 's concert all the way to Lakewood . Stephen was waiting for dinner and reading a King Arthur story aloud to the children when they entered the living-room . He was glad to see Jimmy and glad , too , of the soft spring weather . We 'll have eighteen holes of golf to-morrow morning , Jimmy , ' he said cheerfully . Do n't dress , Jane . I 'm as hungry as a bear . ' But Jane thought she would just slip into the red Poiret tea-gown . It would not take a minute . That evening Jimmy played parchesi with the children . Jane sat at Steve 's elbow and advised him on his moves . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Stephen was no parchesi fan . He was glad to be relieved of a duty that had devolved upon him every evening since Miss Parrot 's departure the week before . Jane thought the game was really quite amusing . They laughed a great deal over Steve 's success with the dice . He sent Jimmy 's foremost man home eight times in succession . It was half-past nine before the game was over . When the children had gone upstairs , Stephen cast aside his paper with a yawn . I 'm tired to-night , ' he said . This first hot weather takes it out of you . I 'm going up to bed . ' Jane caught a glint of elation in Jimmy 's eye across Stephen 's unconscious figure . Jane did not like that glint . Of course , Jimmy just wanted to sit and gossip by the fire as they had so often gossiped , but he should not have allowed himself to look elated . Curiously , at that moment , Jane thought of her father . Avoid all appearance of evil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the pantry . P347I 'm tired , too , Stephen , ' she said evenly . I 'd like to turn in early myself . ' The glint of elation in Jimmy 's eyes turned quickly to a look of incredulity , then to one of mock consternation . See here , ' he protested , I 'm not tired . I 'm not tired at all . I was looking forward to a big evening . ' Sorry , ' smiled Jane . You 're not going to get it . ' She turned with Stephen toward the door . See here , ' said Jimmy again , are you just going off to bed and leave me standing here on the hearthrug ? I do n't call it civil . ' That 's just what we 're going to do , ' smiled Jane . Good-night . ' It 's a sell , ' said Jimmy . It 's not ten o'clock yet . What will I do with myself ? I ca n't go to sleep for hours . I 'll be reduced to writing a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instantly confirmed Jane 's plan to go up with Stephen . He had already started for the stairs .  --  ' That 's a fine idea , Jimmy , ' said Jane pleasantly . There 's note-paper in the desk by the window . Give her my love and tell her I think the concerto is grand . ' Jimmy crossed the hearthrug and stood at her side for a moment in hesitant silence . He laid a restraining finger on her arm . Do n't go up , Jane , ' he said persuasively . I want to talk to you . ' Ca n't you talk to me to-morrow ? ' asked Jane , a trifle uncertainly . Good-night , Jimmy , ' called Stephen from the staircase . Remember , eighteen holes to-morrow morning ! ' Jane turned to glance up at him . He was standing on the landing , looking down on them a little wearily . Jane sud- denly thought their figures had assumed a rather intimate pose . She started away from Jimmy and walked out into the hall . She threw him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after her so wistfully that she could not help twinkling back at him . No , I 'm going up , ' she said pleasantly . Good-night , Jimmy . ' She followed Stephen up the darkened staircase and into the mellow lamplight of their little blue bedroom . Stephen , with a familiar gesture , was already hanging his grey sack coat over the back of a chair . He looked up at Jane as she entered . You look very pretty to-night in that red thing , ' he said . Jane glanced at herself in the cheval glass  --  she did look pretty . Her eyes were still twinkling at the thought of desertedJimmy and her lips were curved in a little involuntary smile . Stephen continued to look at her in silence . You 'll miss Jimmy , ' said Stephen , when he goes back East . ' Jane turned to stare at him . Stephen had never made any comment on Jimmy just like that , before . Could Stephen be really  --  troubled ? He went on speaking very evenly . But you 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little pause . I 've been thinking , Jane , ' he continued  --  what had Stephen been thinking ? Jane thought breathlessly  --  I 've been wondering if this would n't be a good spring to see about getting Steve 's teeth straightened . If he wore braces at Gull Rocks this summer Jane turned from him in an absurd surge of irritation . Oh , yes  --  she would have plenty of time , now , to straighten Steve 's teeth and plan for Gull Rocks and Stephen was unbuttoning his waistcoat . I think you 'd better take him in to the dentist ' hebegan . P349I ' 11 take him in , Stephen , ' said Jane snappishly . Of course I 'll take him in . Why do you act as if you had to nag me ' Her voice died down . Stephen had paused , in the act of untyinghis necktie , to look at her in amazement . Jane walked over to him and laid her hand on his arm . I 'll take him in , dear , ' she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on untying his necktie . Jane slipped out of the Poiret teagown . Jimmy , she supposed , was writing a letter to Agnes at the living-room desk downstairs . Next morning Stephen had his eighteen holes of golf with Jimmy . The April day had dawned very bright and fair . The men came home from the links just a little late for luncheonwith Jane and the children . It was nearly three before the meal was finished . While they were drinking their afterluncheoncoffee , Mr. and Mrs. Ward turned up , rather unexpectedly . The day was so pleasant , Mrs. Ward remarked , that they had motored out to spend Sunday afternoon with the grandchildren . Mr. Ward had greeted Jimmy very affably , but Mrs. Ward looked distinctly affronted by his presence at Jane 's fireside . When Stephen produced a cocktailfor the men at tea-time , Jane saw her mother fasten a lynx eye on Jimmy , as he stood on the hearthrug , nonchalantly toying with his glass of amber liquid . Jane could not suppressa smile . She knew that her mother was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass unobserved . He made no attempt to do so , however . He had made no attempt , all day , to resume the conversation of which Jane had deprived him on the previous evening . Mr. and Mrs. Ward did not leave their grandchildren until after six o'clock . It was time to dress for dinner when they had gone . Both men seemed silent , Jane thought , at table . Tired out , P350perhaps , by their morning of golf in the open air . Cicily rather monopolized the conversation . She was chattering of the educational plans of the rising generation . In particular of the educational plans of Jack Bridges , on whom the family interest was centring that spring . At seventeen Jack was about to take his final entrance examination for Harvard . He was a clever boy , snub-nosed and twinkle-eyed like his rather , with a strong natural bent for the physical sciences . Robin and Isabel were very proud of him . Cicily , herself , wanted to go to Rosemary next year with her cousin Belle . Jane had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She tried again , a little half-heartedly , this evening at the table . Why should I go to college , Mumsy ? ' said Cicily . And lock myself up on a campus for four years ? ' Lock herself up on a campus , thought Jane . That was what college life meant to the rising generation . For her Bryn Mawr had spelled emancipation . Through Pembroke Arch she had achieved a world of unprecedented freedom . Under the Bryn Mawr maples she had escaped from family surveillance , from the opinions ' of her mother and Isabel , from ideas with which she could never agree , from standards to which she could never conform . To Agnes and herself the routine existence in a Bryn Mawr dormitory had seemed a life of liberty , positively bordering upon licence . To Cicily it seemed ridiculous servitude . I do n't want to go to college , ' said Cicily . I want to room with Belle at boarding-school and come out when I 'm eight-een . ' Do n't you want to know anything ? ' asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his eyes robbed the question of all harshness . I do n't want to know anything I can learn at Bryn Mawr , ' said Cicily airily . P351That 's a very silly thing to say , ' said Jane . Oh , I do n't know , ' interposed Jimmy brightly . What use is knowledge to a girl with hair like Cicily 's ? Let her trust to instinct . I bet that takes her farther , Jane , than you 'll care to see her go . ' A little knowledge might hold her back , ' said Jane . I do n't want to be held- back , ' said Cicily promptly . " ' I want to do everything and go everywhere . ' Nevertheless , you want to know what you 're doing and where you 're going , ' said Jane severely . I do n't know that I do , ' said Cicily . I like surprises . ' The child 's a hedonist , Jane , ' said Jimmy . Let her alone . You 'll never understand a hedonist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , is the end . " Pater said that first , but it 's very true . You 'll never read Pater , Cicily , if you do n't go to Bryn Mawr , and you probably would n't like him if you did . He does n't speak the language of your generation . Nevertheless , he is your true prophet . I learned pages of Pater by heart ; when I was at night school at the settlement . I thought he had the right idea . " A counted number of pulses only is given to us of a variegated , dramatic life . How shall we pass most swiftly from point to point and be present always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy ? To burn always with this hard , gem-like flame , to maintain this ecstasy , is success in life . " That was my credo , Cicily , when I was not so much older than you are . Go on burning , my dear , burn like your golden hair , and never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him with wide , non-comprehending eyes . Jane knew she had not understood a word of the Pater . That 's very immoral doctrine , ' she said . But did n't you think it was swell , ' said Jimmy , when you first read it with Agnes at Bryn Mawr ? '  |p352Yes  , I did , ' said Jane honestly . But I was too young to know what it meant . ' The trouble with education is , ' said Jimmy cheerfully , that we always read everything when we 're too young to know what it means . And the trouble with life is that we 're always too busy to re-read it later . There 's more sense in books , Cicily , than you 'd really believe . Though , of course , they do n't teach you anything vital that you ca n't learn for yourself . ' Jane rose from the table . Go up and do your home work , Cicily , ' she said cheerfully . And do n't listen to Mr. Trent . You 'll never learn the past @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's Latin Grammar . ' The children trooped upstairs to the playroom . Stephen picked up the Sunday paper . What with the golf all morning and the family all afternoon , he had not really assimilated the real estate columns . Jimmy wandered over to the glass doors that opened on the terrace . Come out in the garden , Maud , ' he said lightly to Jane . The moon is full to-night . ' Jane looked at Stephen a little hesitantly . You come , too , Stephen , ' she said . Stephen looked up over the margin of the Morning Tribune . ' Run along with Jimmy , ' he said . Then , as his eyes returned to the real estate page , I think this Michigan Avenue Extension Bridge is really going through . That lot of your father 's on Pine Street will be worth a fortune some day , Jane . ' Jane walked at Jimmy 's side across the shaded terrace and down into the moonlit garden . They strolled the length of it in silence . The night was fresh and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eastern sky . It seemed racing rapidly through the ragged rents in the tattered clouds . There was no wind in the garden , however , The moon-blanched daffodilswere motionless in their bed beneath the evergreens . The boughs of the apple tree did not stir . Only the cloudshadowsraced , as the moon was racing , across the expanse of lawn . Jimmy sat down on a green bench beneath the apple tree . Sit down , Jane , ' he said . Are you cold ? ' No , ' said Jane , sinking down on the bench beside him . I think the air is lovely . ' Better put on my coat , ' said Jimmy . No  --  I do n't need it , ' said Jane . Jimmy took it off , however , and wrapped it about her shoulders . He turned the collar up , very carefully , around her bare throat . Jane could smell the faint distinctive odour of the tweed as he did so . I want you to be comfortable , ' said Jimmy . I am comfortable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' continued Jimmy , ignoring her comment , because I 'm going to talk to you for a long , long time . It will take a long , long time , even out here in the moonlight , to make you understand all that I have to say . ' Jane looked quickly up at him , disquieted by his words . Jimmy 's face was very calm . He seemed , at the moment , a very tranquil faun . In one instant , however , by one sentence , he shattered the tranquillity of the moment . What do you think , ' he said , is going to happen to you and me ? ' Jane stared at him . To you  --  and me ? ' she faltered . He looked steadily down at her . Why , Jimmy '  --  she was conscious of smiling nervously  --  what  --  what could happen ? '  |p354He  ignored her foolish question . I 'm married to Agnes , ' said Jimmy ; you 're married to Stephen . We 've known each other just seven months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's going to happen ? ' Jane , in her utter astonishment , half-rose from the bench . We  --  we 're not in love with each other , ' she protested hotly . Jane '  --  said Jimmy sadly  --  do n't waste time in prevarication . The night is all too short as it is . ' I 'm not in love with you , ' said Jane , sinking back on the bench . Oh , yes , you are , ' said Jimmy . I love Stephen , ' said Jane , staring straight into his eyes . Yes , ' said Jimmy ; that makes it worse , for you 're not in love with him . There 's a great difference , you know , in those two states of mind , or rather of emotion . You 're in love with me and I 'm in love with you . I have n't been in love with Agnes for years . I do n't even love her , any more . She 's irritated me too often . I respect her  --  she amuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't talk like that ! ' cried Jane sharply . But you love Stephen , ' went on Jimmy imperturbably . Which complicates everything , for of course you 'll want to consider him . ' Consider him ! ' cried Jane . Of course I want to consider him ! ' Yes , ' said Jimmy reasonably . That 's what I said . That 's what makes it so difficult . ' Makes what so difficult ? ' cried Jane . My persuading you to come away with me , ' said Jimmy calmly . Have you lost your mind ? ' demanded Jane . For you are going to come away with me , in the end , Jane , ' P355said Jimmy . But I 'll have to do an awful lot of talking first . ' I 'm not in love with you , ' said Jane again . Meeting Jimmy 's eyes , however , her glance fell before his gaze . No use in not facing it , Jane , ' said Jimmy . I  --  I did n't even know you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  you 've never made love to me except  --  except just that once  --  ' I 've been making love to you , Jane , ' said Jimmy , from the moment that you resented that kiss . Not before . I just kissed you for the fun of it , and you were quite right to resent it . But since then , Jane , I have n't thrown a glance or said a word that was n't arrant love-making . Oh '  --  he stopped her indignant protest  --  I know you never recognized it . You 're invincibly innocent . Any other woman would have known it at once , and would either have kicked me out or responded in kind . In either case I 'd have tired of her in two months . ' You 're asking me to respond in kind , now , ' said Jane tremulously . At least  --  at least I suppose you are . ' You bet I am , ' said Jimmy . So that you can tire of me in two months ? ' asked Jane . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promptly . I want you to come away with me , Jane , to-night , or to-morrow or next week Wednesday  --  any time you say . I want you to face the music . I want you to meet your fate . I want you to live , before you die . Did you know that you 'd never lived , Jane ? That 's why you 're so invincibly innocent . I want you to live , darling . I want to live with you . ' His eager face was very close to hers . But still he had not so much as touched her hands . They were clasped very tightly together in her lap . Jimmy , ' said Jane brokenly , please stop . ' Why ? ' said Jimmy eagerly . ' Because it 's no use , ' said Jane . I wo n't deceive Stephen , or betray Agnes , or leave my children . '   But you love me ? ' said Jimmy . Jane 's troubled eyes fell before his ardent glance . You love me ? ' he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling  --  say it ! ' His shaken accents tore at her heartstrings . Yes , ' whispered Jane . I  --  I love you . ' Her eyes were on the cloud-shadows racing across the lawn . She could hardly believe that she had uttered the sentence that rang in her ears . It had fluttered from her lips before she was aware . The words themselves gave actuality to the statement . Once said they were true . They trembled in the silent garden . Winged words , that could not be recalled . Jane ! ' breathed Jimmy . And still he did not touch her . Staring straight before her at the cloud-shadows , Jane was suddenly conscious of a dreadful , devastating wish that he would . Jane  --  ' said Jimmy falteringly . Suddenly he took her in his arms . Jane felt herself lost in a maze of emotion . Jimmy , ' said Jane , after a moment , this is terrible  --  this is perfectly terrible . I  --  I ca n't tell even you how I feel . ' She slipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Until he repeated them , Jane had not realized the tender import of her words . He took her again in his arms . Jimmy  --  do n't ! ' said Jane faintly . I 'm sinking , Jimmy , I 'm sinking into a pit that a moment before was unthinkable ! Stop kissing me , Jimmy ! For God 's sake , stop kissing me ! I want to think ! ' I do n't want you to think , ' said Jimmy . I just want you to feel . ' But I  --  I am thinking ! ' said Jane pitifully . ' Do n't do it ! ' said Jimmy.  |p357But  Jane steadfastly put away his arms . Jimmy , ' she said desperately , we must think . We must think of every one . If I went away with you , we would n't achieve happiness . ' Of course we would , ' said Jimmy . We 've only one life to live , Jane , and that life 's half over . Let 's make the most of it while it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , and Agnes 's ' Do n't think of them , ' said Jimmy . Think only of us . Are our lives nothing ? ' I ca n't think only of us , ' said Jane . You could if you came away with me , ' said Jimmy . You will come , wo n't you , Jane ? ' No , Jimmy , ' said Jane very sadly . Then I 'll carry you off , darling , ' said Jimmy , to some chimerical place . We 'll jump over a broomstick together in the dark of the moon to the tinkle of a tambourine ! Let 's sail for the South Sea Islands , Jane , just as we planned that first evening . Let ' s go to Siam and Burma and on into India  --  ' Oh , Jimmy , ' sighed Jane , you 're so ridiculous  --  and so adorable . ' There was only one answer to that . You 're adorable , ' said Jimmy , as he kissed her . And ridiculous ! ' Jimmy , ' said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  though I never dreamed of you like this before . ' Invincible innocent ! ' laughed Jimmy . You 're going away with me ! You 're going to leave this garden forever . You 'll never see that apple tree in bloom again ' Never that apple tree ? ' said Jane . But you 'll see other trees in bloom , ' smiled Jimmy , in other gardens . ' But not that one ? ' said Jane . Not that one with Jenny'sp358swing hanging from its branches and Steve 's tree-house nailed to its trunk and the bare place beneath it where the grass never grew after we took up Cicily 's first sandpile ? ' Do n't think , darling ! ' said Jimmy quickly . They sat a long time in silence . Cold , darling ? ' whispered Jimmy , as Jane stirred in his arms . No  --  not cold , ' murmured Jane . Thinking ? ' whispered Jimmy . No  --  not thinking , ' murmured Jane . Not thinking any more at all . ' Coming ? ' smiled Jimmy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do n't ask me that or I 'll begin thinking . Just hold me , Jimmy , hold me in your arms . ' When Jane opened her eyes next morning , the cold lightof the April dawn was breaking over the garden . She hadcome into the house with Jimmy some four hours before . They had turned out the lights in the living-room and creptsilently up the stairs and exchanged one last kiss at the doorof Jane 's bedroom . She had opened the door with elaborateprecaution and moved quietly into her room . Precautions , however , were unnecessary . Stephen was sound asleep onthe sleeping-porch . Jane had slipped out of her clothes andinto her nightgown in the darkness and had stood , for a morement , in her bedroom window gazing out at the silverygarden . She had raised her bare arms in the moonlight , as if to fold to her heart a phantom lover . She had smiled attheir milky whiteness . Then she had jumped into bed andcovered herself up and waited , a little fearfully , for besiegingthoughts . They had not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in ambush . Jane won-P359dered and , while wondering and feeling , fell serenely asleep . She was wakened at dawn by the chirping of birds in the oak trees on the terrace . She opened her eyes in her familiar blue bedroom . She did not remember , for a moment , what had happened in the garden . Then the thoughts pounced on her . They had been in ambush . Serried ranks of thoughts , battalions of thoughts , little valiant warrior thoughts that rose up singly from the ranks and stabbed her mind before she was aware of their coming . She recalled the events of the evening with horror and incredulity . It could not have happened . If it had , she must have been mad . She was Jane Carver  --  Mrs. Stephen Carver  --  Stephen Carver 's wife and the mother of his three children . She was Jane Ward  --  little Jane Ward  --  John Ward 's daughter  --  who had been born on Pine Street and gone to Miss Milgrim 's School with Agnes and to Bryn Mawr with Agnes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grown up and married Stephen . She had been Stephen Carver 's wife for nearly sixteen years . Yes , she must have-been mad last night in the moonlit garden . Mad  --  to let Jimmy speak , to let him hold her in his arms . Mad to sit with him there  --  beneath the apple tree  --  how many hours ? Four  --  five  --  six hours she had sat with Jimmy beneath the apple tree , deceiving Stephen and betrayingAgnes and planning to abandon her children . Had it really happened ? Was it a dream ? Something should be done about dreams like that . You should not even dream that you were deceiving your husband or betraying your friend or planning to abandon your children . But it was not a dream . If it were a dream , she would be lying be . side Stephen in her bed on the sleeping-porch . No  --  it had happened . It had irrevocably happened . The long path into which she had turned at the moment that she had looked into Jimmy 's eyes on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitable ending . She loved Jimmy . She had , incredibly , told him so . The telling had changed everything . It had changed Jimmy . It had changed herself , most of all . It had changed everything , Jane saw clearly in the light of the April dawn , but the most essential facts of the situation . You did not deceive your husband  --  you did not betray your friend  --  you did not abandon your children . Yet she had promised Jimmy only four short hours ago , on the bench beneath the apple tree , to do all those things . She had promised him , just before parting . Jane closed her eyes to shut out the awful clarity of the April dawn , to shut out the familiar walls of the bedroom , to shut out the serried ranks of thoughts that clustered about her bed . It was no use  --  the thoughts were still there , crowding behind her eyelids . They would not be denied  --  battering , besieging thoughts . No feeling left , curiously enough , or almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory of feeling  --  feeling so briefly experienced , to be forever forsworn . Of course she would forswear it . She had been mad in the garden . Moon-mad . Man-mad . She had been everything that was impossible and undefendable . She had not been Jane Carver or little Jane Ward . She had been some incrediblechangeling . But she was Jane Carver now , and Jane Ward , too . Little Jane Ward , who had been brought up on Pine Street by a Victorian family to try to be a good girl and mind her parents . Jane Carver , who had behind her the strength of fifteen incorruptible years of honest living as Stephen 's wife . Of course she would forswear the feeling . She would tell Jimmy that morning . Jimmy . At the memory of Jimmy the serried ranks of thoughts fell back a little . A sudden wave of emotion remindedher that feeling was not so easily forsworn . Jimmy 's face in the moonlight  --  his eyes  --  his lips  --  his arms aboutp361her body . Suddenly Jane heard Stephen stirring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The day had begun . This day in which thoughts must give birth to action . This day in which feeling must be forsworn . Stephen , struggling into his bathrobe , appeared on tiptoe at the door to the sleeping-porch . He looked a little sleepy , but very cheerful . Hello , ' he said , you awake ? Why did you sleep in here ? ' I did n't want to wake you up , ' said Jane . She was amazed at the casual tone she managed to achieve . I sat out very late with Jimmy in the garden . ' I went up early , ' said Stephen , just as soon as I finished with the paper . Coming down to breakfast ? ' No , ' said Jane . Ask Sarah to bring up a tray . ' Jane felt she could not face a Lakewood family breakfast . Whatever life demanded of her on this dreadful day , it did not demand that she should sit behind her coffee tray , surrounded by her children , and pour out Jimmy 's coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her room until Stephen had gone to the train , until the children had left for school . Then she would go down and tell Jimmy that she had been mad in the garden . Two hours later , Jane opened her bedroom door and walked down the staircase . No Jimmy in the hall . She entered the living-room and saw him standing by the terrace doors , gazing out at the apple tree . He wheeled quickly around at the sound of her step on the threshold . Jimmy looked tired . Jimmy looked worn . But Jimmy looked terriblyhappy . Jane smiled tremulously . Jimmy  --  ' she said , still standing in the doorway . Do n't say it ! ' cried Jimmy . I know just how you feel . I know just how you 've reacted . Do n't say it , Jane ! Give yourself time to  --  to get used to it . '  | I am used to it , ' said Jane pitifully . I 'm terribly used to it . I 've been thinking for hours . ' I know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked quickly over to her and caught her hand in his . It was inevitable , Jane , that you 'd think those thoughts . Do n't  --  do n't let them trouble you , Jane . I knew how it would be . ' You knew how it would be ? ' faltered Jane . I even knew you would n't come down to breakfast . In point of fact , I did n't come down to breakfast myself . In spite of all the many things I 've done , Jane , in and out of camp meetings , I ca n't say that I ever planned to run off with the wife of a friend before . I did n't seem to care much about meeting Stephen myself , this morning . I did n't seem to care much about sharing his eggs and bacon . ' You have n't had any breakfast ? ' said Jane stupidly . Jimmy shook his head . I ' 11 ring for a tray . ' She moved to the bell by the chimney-piece . Jimmy followed her across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Jane , her hand on the bell-rope . Those thoughts , you know , are n't really  --  really important . I mean  --  they do n't change anything . ' They change everything , ' said Jane dully . Sarah , a breakfast tray , here in the living-room , for Mr. Trent . ' And one for Mrs. Carver , ' said Jimmy , with an affable smile for the maid in the doorway . I 'm sure you have n't eaten a bite this morning . I 'm sure you just drained down a cup of black coffee . ' That 's just what I did , ' said Jane , smiling wanly at Jimmy 's omniscience . Two breakfast trays , Sarah , ' grinned Jimmy in dismissal . Then , when the girl had gone : Sit down here , darling , on theP363sofa , with a pillow at your back . Put your feet up . There ! Comfortable , now ? ' Very , ' said Jane with another wan smile . Jimmy , you make it awfully hard for me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy brightly . That you take it all back ? Do n't trouble to tell it , Jane . Just sit there and rest and wait for your breakfast . When you 've eaten it , life will seem much rosier . ' He ' stood looking down at her very cheerfullyfrom the hearthrug . I wish I could sit down on the floor , Jane , and take your hands and tell you I adore you , but I really think I had n't better do it until Sarah has come in with the breakfast trays . ' You had n't better ever do it , ' said Jane . Nonsense , ' said Jimmy . I 'm going to do it innumerablemornings . In the South Sea Islands and Siam and Burma ' Jane could n't help laughing . Jimmy , ' she said , you 're perfectly incorrigible . But I mean it . I really mean it . I 'm terribly sorry  --  I know it 's rough on you  --  but  --  but I made a dreadful mistake last night in the garden . ' And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ' smiled Jimmy . Well , presently you 'll discover again that you do . ' No , Jimmy . ' Jane 's voice was shrill with conviction . Here 's Sarah , ' murmured Jimmy , turning with nonchalanceto fleck the ash of his cigarette in the empty grate . Sarah placed the breakfast trays on two small tables and retirednoiselessly from the room . Now eat , Jane , ' said Jimmy commandingly . I 'm going to let you have all that breakfast before I even kiss you . ' Jane thought the breakfast would choke her . But somehow , under the stimulus of Jimmy 's pleasant conversation , sheP364found she had consumed the entire contents of the tray , Jimmy rang again for Sarah . When the trays were removed , he stepped quickly over to her and sank on his knees by the sofa . Darling ! ' said Jimmy , seizing her hands in his . Jimmy ! ' cried Jane in terror . Do n't kiss me ! Do n't you dare to kiss me ! I 'm not the woman I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ held him in check . Darling , ' said Jimmy , still clinging firmly to her hands , I know it 's terribly hard for you . I know it 's much worse for you than it is for me . You 'll have to face Stephen , whom you love , and a scandal , which you 'll hate . You 'll have to leave your children for a time  --  though , of course , you 'll see them afterwards . I love your children , Jane , and they like me . They 're great kids . But of course you 'll have to leave them . It 's a terrible sacrifice  --  and what have I to offer you ? ' Oh , Jimmy , ' said Jane pitifully , do n't say that ! It is n't that ! ' I know it is n't , but still I have to say it . I 'm a total loss as a husband , Jane . I 'm a rolling stone and I 'll never gather moss . We 'll wander about the world together and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jobs that wo n't keep me too long in any one place . You 'll be awfully uncomfortable , Jane , a great deal of the time . And maybe lonely ' No , I would n't be lonely , ' said Jane . I 'm not so sure , ' said Jimmy . I think there are lots of raggle-taggle gypsies that you would n't find so very congenial on closer acquaintance . They 're rather sordid , you know , and just a little promiscuous , in close quarters . ' I would n't care , ' said Jane eagerly ; I would n't care , Jimmy , as long as I had you . ' Well , then , ' smiled Jimmy , drawing a long breath , well ,  |p365then   --  if that 's the way you feel , just why am I not to dare to kiss you ? ' Because I 'm not going away with you , Jimmy . ' Jane drew her hands from his . I 'm not going to do it . This is n't just the silly reaction of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something much more serious . I 'm in love with you , Jimmy , but I love you , too . I love you , just as I love Stephen and the children . I love you as I love Agnes . And that 's one of the reasons why I wo n't let you do this thing . Ca n't I make you understand , Jimmy , what I mean ? When you love people , you 've got to be decent . You want to be decent . You want to be good . Just plain good  --  the way you were taught to be when you were a little child . Love 's the greatest safeguard in life against evil . I wo n't do anything , Jimmy , if I can possibly help it , that will keep me from looking any one I love in the eye . ' Her voice was trembling so that she could not keep it up a moment longer . She turned away from jimmy to hide her tears . In a moment he had tucked a big clean handkerchief into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , smooth linen . Jimmy rose , a trifle unsteadily , to his feet . Jane , ' he said , Jane  --  you almost shake me . ' Jane wept on in silence . See here , ' said Jimmy presently ; his voice had changed abruptly : This wo n't do , you know . For it really is n't true  --  it 's very sweet , but it 's silly  --  it 's sentimental . It does n't do anybody any good for a man and woman who are in love with each other to go on sordidly living with people they do n't love . Stephen would n't want you to live with him under those circumstances . Agnes would n't want me to live with her . They 're both exceptionally decent people . ' So we 're to profit by their decency ? ' said Jane coldly . To be , ourselves , indecent ? '  |p366Darling  , ' said Jimmy , it is n't indecent to live with the man you love . ' Jane rose abruptly from the sofa . You 're just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But you ca n't change them . It is n't right for married people , happily married people , to leave their homes and children for their own individual pleasure . ' But we 're not happily married people , ' said Jimmy . If we 're not , ' said Jane steadfastly , it 's only our own fault . Neither Stephen nor Agnes has ever sinned against us . They love us and they trust us . They trusted us , once for all , with their life happiness . I could n't feel decent , Jimmy , and betray that trust . ' Jane , ' said Jimmy , I do n't understand you . With all your innocence you 've always seemed so emancipated . **25;296;TOOLONG . You 've always seemed to understand the complications of living . To sympathize with the people who were tangled up in them . You 've always said Oh , yes , ' said Jane , I 've done a lot of talking . It made me feel very sophisticated to air my broad-minded views . I was very smug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could understand how anybody could do anything . I used to laugh at Mamma for her Victorian views . I used to think it was very smart to say that every Lakewood housewife was potentially a light lady . I used to think I believed it . I did believe it theoretically , Jimmy . But now  --  now when it comes to practice  --  I see there 's a great difference . ' But there is n't any difference , Jane , ' said Jimmy . Not any essential difference . Just one of convention . You 're a woman before you 're a Lakewood housewife . " The Colonel 's lady and Judy O'Grady are sisters under their skins ! " ' But they 're not , Jimmy ! That 's just Kipling 's revolt against Victorian prudery . I suppose he felt very sophisticatedP367when he first got off that line ! The complications of living seem very complicated when you look at them from a distance . When you 're tangled up in them yourself , you know they 're very simple . If you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how little you may want to do it , you know exactly what you ought to do . ' She turned away from him and stood staring out through the terrace doors at the April garden . For a long time there was silence in the room . ThenI  --  I do n't believe  --  you love me , ' said Jimmy slowly . Jane turned her white face from the April garden . Then you 're wrong , Jimmy , ' she said gently . You 're very wrong . It 's killing me to do this thing I 'm doing . It 's killing me to be with you , here in this room . Will you please go away  --  back to town , I mean  --  and  --  and do n't come back until you 've accepted my decision . ' I 'll never accept it , ' said Jimmy grimly . Then do n't come back , ' said Jane . Without another word he left the room . Jane opened the terrace doors and walked out into the garden . She walked on beyond the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the apple tree . She had been sobbing a long time before she realized that she still held Jimmy 's handkerchief in her hand . She buried her face in it until the sobs were stilled in a mute misery that Jane felt was going to last a lifetime . She sat more than an hour on that bench . When she returned to the house , Sarah told her that Mr. Trent had gone back to the city on the eleven-fifteen. viiFive days later , Jimmy returned to Lakewood . He turned up , early in the afternoon , and found Jane superintending the gardener , who was spading up the rose-bed in the garden.  | She looked up from the roots of a Dorothy Perkins and saw him standing on the terrace . She was no longer surprised that she was so easily able to dissemble her emotion . Jane had had plenty of practice in the fine art of dissembling emotion during the last five days . I think you 'd better order another load of black earth , Swanson , ' she said casually and turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite motionless , watching her approachthrough the sunny garden . His face was very serious and his smile was very grave . Jane ascended the terrace steps and held out her hand to him . He took it in silence and held it very tightly . You do n't know what it does to me , ' said Jimmy , to see you again . ' Have you accepted my decision ? ' said Jane . No , ' said Jimmy abruptly , of course not . Did you think I would ? ' He drew her hand through his arm and led her over to the corner of the terrace that was sheltered by the oak trees . The oak trees were just bursting into pink and wineredbuds . They did not give much shelter , but from that terrace corner you could not see the rose-bed . I asked you not to come back until you had , ' said Jane , withdrawing her hand from the crook of his arm and sitting down on the brick parapet of the terrace . Jane , you 're really invincible , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ innocent ! Do you really mean to tell me that you have n't spent the last five days regrettingthat you sent me out of your life ? ' I do n't think that there 's anything to laugh at in this situation , ' said Jane severely . Darling ! ' said Jimmy  --  in a moment he was all penitence and contrition  --  I 'm not laughing . You know I 'm notp369laughing . I 'm preserving the light touch  --  something very different in situations of an emotional character . But I repeat my question  --  have n't you been awfully sorry ? ' Of course I 've been sorry , ' said Jane . I 've been in hell . ' Jimmy looked down at her very tenderly . I 've been there with you , Jane , ' he said soberly . Do n't you think it 's time you let us both out ? ' Jane shook her head . I guess we 're there to stay , Jimmy , ' she said . Do you know , as far as I 'm concerned , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I could n't bear would be the thought that I could ever get over you . ' Why ? ' said Jimmy . To feel the way I feel about you , Jimmy , ' said Jane , and then to get over it , would be the most disillusioning of all human experiences . I 'm going to keep faith , forever , with the feeling I have for you at this moment . ' Behind the tenderness in Jimmy 's eyes glittered the ghost of his twinkle . Well , that 's very sweet of you , darling , ' he said . But do n't you think that assurance , taken by itself , is just a little barren ? It has a note of finality  --  ' It is final , ' said Jane . That 's all I have to say to you . ' Well , ' said Jimmy , drawing a long breath , I 've a great deal more than that to say to you . Listen , you ridiculous child  --  if you think I 'm going to let you ruin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , I beg of you not to go into this again . I 've had  --  really I 've had  --  a terrible five days . But I have n't changed my mind . I have n't changed it one iota . I 'm glad you 're going away . I hope I do n't see you again for years . It just kills me to see you . It kills me to live with yourp370memory , but I would n't forget you for anything in the world . ' His eyes were very bright as he stood looking down at her . Jane turned her head to gaze out over the fiat , sunny Skokie Valley . After a moment she spoke again . Her voice had changed abruptly . It had grown dull and lifeless . When are you going ? ' she asked . That depends upon you , ' said Jimmy . If it depends upon me , ' said Jane , still not turning her head , you ca n't go too soon . ' Jane , ' said Jimmy , dropping quickly down beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't come with me ? ' No , ' said Jane . You do n't want to live ? ' I 'll live , ' said Jane tonelessly , for Stephen and the children . That sounds very melodramatic , I know , but it 's exactly what I 'm going to do . There 's just one other thing I want to say to you , Jimmy . I thought of it after you 'd gone the other day . ' She turned her head to look into his eyes . I 'm never going to tell Stephen anything about this , and I hope you wo n't tell Agnes . I could n't decide , at first , just what I ought to do about that . I could n't decide whether it was courage or cowardice that made me want not to tell . I could n't decide whether Stephen ought to know . You see '  --  she smiled a little gravely  --  I really feel terribly about it , and I know , no matter how dreadful the telling was , I 'd feel better after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soul . I wish I were a Catholic , Jimmy . I wish I were a good Catholic and could pour the whole story into the impersonal ear of a priest in the confessional . But I 'm not a Catholic and Stephen is n't a priest . So I think I 'll just have to live with a secret . I 'll just have to live with Stephen , knowing that I know , but he does n't , just what I did . ' Jimmy 's sad little smile was very tender.  |p371You  did n't do so awfully much , you know , Jane , ' he said . But I felt everything , ' said Jane soberly . I think it 's not so much what you do that matters , as what you feel . What I felt is somehow what I ca n't tell Stephen . I 've never had a secret before , Jimmy . I 've never had anything I could n't tell the world . I hope  --  I hope you 'll feel that way about Agnes . For I really feel about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm not going back to Agnes , ' said Jimmy suddenly . Jane stared at him in horror . You 're not  --  going back  --  to Agnes ? ' she faltered . Did you think I could ? ' said Jimmy harshly . Why not ? ' asked Jane . Her eyes searched his . Suddenly her mouth began to tremble . Why not  --  if I can  --  stay with Stephen ? ' Oh  --  my darling ! ' breathed Jimmy . You must go back to her , Jimmy , ' said Jane . Do n't you see  --  if you do n't , I 'll have ruined her life just as if I 'd gone away with you ? ' I ca n't go back to her , ' said Jimmy . He stood up suddenly and took a few steps across the terrace , then turned to look at her again . No , Jane . If you wo n't come with me , I 'm going without you . I 'm going to see the world before I die . I 'm going West @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first boat I can catch for the Orient . I do n't know just how I 'll manage it , but I 'll work my way somehow . ' But you 'll come back ? ' said Jane . She rose as she spoke and walked anxiously over to him . You 'll have to come back , you know . ' Oh  --  I suppose one always comes back , ' said Jimmy uncertainly . I 'll probably die in East St. Louis . ' But before you die , ' urged Jane , attempting a shaky little smile , before you die , you will come back to Agnes ? '   Well  --  nothing 's impossible , ' said Jimmy . He looked moodily down at her . Except , apparently , one thing . ' When are you leaving ? ' asked Jane . To-morrow , perhaps . It 's Saturday , you know . I need my last pay-check . ' Then this is good-bye ? ' They were strolling , now , side by side , back to the terrace doors . I guess it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He opened the door for her and they crossed the livingroomin silence . He picked up his hat from the hall table and stood looking down at her by the front door . Do you want me to kiss you good-bye ? ' said Jimmy . Jane shook her head . Two great tears that were trembling on her lashes rolled down her cheeks . She ignored them proudly . Well  --  I 'm going to do it anyway ! ' said Jimmy . He caught her roughly in his arms . In the ecstasy of that embrace , Jane knew that she was crying wildly . Suddenly , he put her from him . Without a word of farewell , he had opened the door and was gone . Jane leaned helplessly against its panels , exhausted by emotion . Suddenly she turned and ran rapidly up the stairs to the window on the landing . But she was too late . The gravel road was empty . Jimmy had disappeared around the bushes at the entrance of the drive . P373JANE stood staring at the map of Europe that Stephen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staring at the little irregular row of red-and-blue thumbtacks that marked the battle-line in eastern France . She was staring at the holes in the canvas where the thumbtacks had once been and where they might be again to-morrow , as the fortunes of men and war wavered over the battle-fields . Over the battle-fields where men were fighting and dying while Jane stared at the map . She had been staring at it just like that for five days . For more than three months that map had hung on the living-room wall and Jane had thought nothing of it . She had not shared Stephen 's interest in the fluctuating battleline . To Jane , preoccupied with desolate thoughts of Jimmy , the war had been merely an irrelevance . A quarrel of diplomatsthat was no concern of hers . The fantastic thought that German and French and English men were dying on those battle-fields , dying by scores of thousands , had never really captured her imagination . It was another- European war . Incredible , of course , in this civilized age , but no nearer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roses , the Napoleonic campaigns , the French defeat of 187o . Even the thought that Andre , at the age of thirty-nine , might be drawn into the conflict had failed to arouse her . Jane was preoccupied with desolate thoughts of Jimmy . He had left Chicago without trying again to speak to her . He had disappeared into silence . Silence that had lasted for two months . Then she had had a picture , postcard with a Chinese stamp upon it . A Chinese stamp and a picture of a little tower-like temple . Jimmy had written just four lines beneath it . Here 's the Chinese shrine , Jane , where I 'd have made you an honest woman . To-day the temple bells are tinkling out of tune . ' That was all . And again there had been silence . A curious silence in which the vast echoes of war could rumble without arresting her attention , but which could always be shattered by the postman 's ring . Silence , in which Jane waited to hear again from Jimmy . Five days ago  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his letter . At the sight of the New York stamp her heart had leapt up  --  was it with thankfulnessor a strange , instinctive revulsion ? Jimmy had returned to Agnes . Jane had opened the letter . She could not understand it . It was dated in Berlin , on the tenth day of August . I 'm going to war , Jane . I 've joined the German army . I joined it under the influence of a beer and a blond . I was n't too drunk , though , to remember my old friends Karl Marx and Bach and Beethoven and Wagner , and just drunk enough to have let Martin Luther slip my mind . I 've got a pull with a Prussian I roomed with when he was a cub reporter on the New York " Staats-Zeitung . " He 's an officer now , and he made me an aide because of my English . It was all awfully irregular , for the army here is highly organized . Nevertheless , he did it and I 'm going to see action at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll probably be shot at dawn by the British . Anyway , I 'm writing the Kaiser that , before I am , we 've got to take Paris , because I 've never seen it . I 'd like to enter it in style the first time . I 'm sending this letter through the lines in a spy 's pocket . He 's going to ramble around through Switzerland and Italy to Washington and hopes to come back with a blue-print orP375two , just in case we follow England into the war . He 'll mail it in New York , if he ever gets there . And now , Jane , to be quite serious for a minute , do you know that I adore you ? Do you know that I feel about you just as I did on the day that I left you ? Do you know that I wish to God that I did n't ? Darling  --  there 's nothing much to say . If you had come away with me , I certainly should not be going to war . This quarrel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'd be safe in that cannibal village by this time , eating roasted missionary in an undusted living-room . But you would n't , and you were wrong , but I could n't do anything about it . I ca n't do anything about it now , not even about the way I feel  --  so I 'm going to war , because that , at least , will be something else again . I certainly do n't want to be killed . Why , I do n't know . If you wo n't marry me , there is nothing new under the sun  --  but there might be , under the sod , where proverbially there is neither marriage nor giving in marriage . I bet I live to sack Paris absent-mindedly , because I will be thinking of you . YourJIB ' Jane stood staring at the map of Europe . Somewhere on that wavering battle-line , as she stood there , Jimmy was fighting in the quarrel that was not of his making , Jimmy was seeking something else again , ' under a rain of shot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jimmy , to go to war on that casual quest ! To go to a war that had become a crusade in the minds of all civilized people in an attitude of ironic detachment . To become  --  of all things  --  a Prussian officer at a moment when a Prussian officer represented to the minds of his countrymen a symbol of all evil . How like Jimmy to become a Prussian officer because of a beer and a blond and a few romantic thoughts on Karl Marx and Bach and Beethovenand Wagner ! Jimmy  --  in a Prussian helmet , looking like a caricature of the Crown Prince . No , not that  --  for there would always be his quizzical eyebrows and his pointed ears and his ironical smile , exactly like a faun 's . A faun , mocking himself , in a Prussian helmet  --  that would be how Jimmy would look , even in the heat of battle . That would be how Jimmy would look , if he lived to sack Paris . If he lived to sack Paris absent-mindedly , because he would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Jimmy 's death was unthinkable . Jimmy 's death in a conflict about the issues of which he did not care a damn . A conflict into which he had been driven by her unkindness No , she would not think that . She would never think that . She had done what she had to do . She had never really regretted it . She would not regret it now . Jimmy had been driven into that conflict by his own restlessspirit  --  by his The ring of the doorbell roused Jane from revery . Not the postman 's ring , though , at two o'clock in the afternoon . Jane returned to the map again . Sarah stood a moment on the threshold , unnoticed . Mrs. Carver , ' she said . Mrs. Carver , here 's a telegram . ' Jane turned from the map and stared at her in silence . No , she thought , dully , no , it would be a cable ! She took the yellow envelope from Sarah 's hand . She opened it without misgiving . Jane , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just received letter from Prussian officer in French prison camp that Jimmy had joined the German army and was killed on the Marne . Had had no word from him since he left Chicago . Jane , dear , this seems for me the end of everything . Could you come to me ? AGNES ' P377The yellow papers fluttered from Jane 's fingers . The chintz-hung living-room turned black before her eyes . She caught herself , however , before falling , on the back of Stephen 's armchair . She closed her eyes a moment and then dully opened them . The familiar living-room had returned . Suddenly she felt Sarah 's hand upon her elbow , she heard Sarah 's voice in her ear . Mrs. Carver  --  here sit down a moment . I 'll get a glass of water . ' Jane shook her head . She stooped suddenly down and picked up the yellow papers . She read the message through once more . All feeling seemed dead . She felt only the need for practical action . I 'm all right , Sarah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Mr. Carver . ' She walked to the telephone in the pantry and gave Stephen 's number . How strange , she thought , at such a moment to turn instinctively to Stephen ! Mr. Carver , ' she said to his secretary . Mrs. Carver speak-ing . ' Yes , dear , ' Stephen 's familiar voice trickled over the wire . Stephen , ' she said quickly , Stephen , I 've just had a wire from Agnes . Jimmy was killed on the Marne . ' On the Marne ! ' cried Stephen , in stupefaction . Yes , ' said Jane dully , he 's dead . He 's been dead for two months . ' Suddenly she heard her voice break into breathless sobbing . But still there was no feeling . Agnes wants me . Will you get me a compartment on the five-thirty , this afternoon ? I 've just time to pack and catch it . ' She was still sobbing . Of course , ' said Stephen . But Jane ' I 'll motor in , ' said Jane , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can you see me off ? ' Of course ! ' cried Stephen . But Jane '   Jane hung up the receiver . She had never told Stephen , she reflected weakly , that Jimmy was in the German army . Sarah ! ' she called sharply . Bring down my big black bag to my bedroom and order the motor for a quarter-past four . ' nHe was killed instantly , ' said Agnes . He was shot in the trenches . He was shot through the head . This German saw it happen . ' She handed Jane a creased and wrinkled paper . It was the letter of the Prussian officer , written in perfect English , in a fine German hand , on a sheet of plain block paper . Jane took it in silence . She was sitting beside Agnes on the battered davenport sofa of the Greenwich Village flat . Little Agnes was playing in the nursery beyond the half-open foldingdoors . It was Saturday afternoon and Agnes had just come home from Macy 's . She was still wearing her new black serge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat . The sheer black chiffon of the widow 's veil , thrown carelessly over it , shadowed her weary eyes . He saw him buried , ' went on Agnes tonelessly , though Jane was reading the letter . It was as if she could not make herself stop talking about it . He saw him buried next day . There ca n't be any mistake . ' Jane went on reading the letter in silence . It was nice of the French to let him mail that letter , was n't it , Jane ? ' said Agnes . Otherwise I might never have known what happened . I might never have known that he had gone to war . ' Jane , having finished the letter , sat turning it over in her hands . Jane , ' said Agnes suddenly , Why did he do it ? Why did he go to war ? ' Jane still sat staring at the finished letter . P379I suppose , ' she said a little huskily , I suppose he  --  he was just caught up in the general excitement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Agnes earnestly . General excitements always left Jimmy cold . There was nothing that Jimmy despised more than the mob spirit . Why , Jimmy was a pacifist  --  as much as he was anything  --  ' Her voice trailed off into silence . Jane looked slowly up at her . Agnes 's sad , worn face was twitching and her throat was throbbing convulsively with the sobs she was trying to master . Jane took her hand in hers . Do n't  --  do n't think about that , Agnes , ' she said simply . It wo n't do any good . You 'll never know . ' No , ' said Agnes , I 'll never know . ' Then , after a pause , ' Jane , you saw what he said about Jimmy 's concerto  --  that he had it with him at the front . ' Yes , ' said Jane . It  --  it must be lost , ' said Agnes sadly . They fought over that trench fol. days after Jimmy  --  died . The dugouts must have been simply exterminated . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Agnes , did you ever hear the end of it ? Did he play it for you ? ' Yes , ' said Jane . Was it good ? ' asked Agnes eagerly . Was it really good ? ' I thought it was very beautiful , ' said Jane . Again they sat in silence . Jane , ' said Agnes suddenly , is n't it dreadful to think there 's nothing left of Jimmy ? With all his cleverness and all his talent he left nothing behind him . The world is just the same as if he had never lived . ' He left you , ' said Jane tremulously . He left you and little Agnes . ' Yes , ' said Agnes , of course he left little Agnes . And he leftp380me . You 're right , Jane . He left me a very different woman than if he 'd never loved me . You 're very clever , Jane , darling , to think of that . A man does live in the change he made in the life of a woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . Again it was Agnes who broke it . And this time with a gallant attempt at a cheerful smile . I have n't thanked you , Jane , for all you did for Jimmy last winter . He simply loved Chicago . He was awfully happy there . He wrote me the gayest letters . ' I 'm glad he did , ' said Jane . He was happy in his work and happy about the concerto . He seemed so young , Jane , and somehow care-free  --  just the way he did when I first knew him . He wrote me very often  --  and always such funny letters . ' No one could be as funny as Jimmy , ' said Jane . ' No , ' said Agnes . He was always funny when he was happy . Do you know , Jane , I 've always understood why he did n't come back to me ? I understood it even at the time . The strongest thing in Jimmy 's life was his sense of adventure . I think those months in Chicago must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and little Agnes in this flat . That seems absurd to you and me , of course , for to us Chicago is just the town we grew up in  --  but to Jimmy I think it must have been rather a castle in Spain . He could n't come back to humble domesticity just after it . He had to wander . To look for other castles , you know , in other countries . But he would have come back , Jane  --  ' Her voice trailed off a trifle wistfully . Of course he would have ! ' said Jane warmly . The thing that kills me , ' said Agnes soberly , is that if he had , you know , our life might have been quite different . My play 's doing awfully well , Jane . They 're going to start aP381second company on the road . I 'm going to take chance , Jane , and resign from Macy 's to write another . think  --  I think that perhaps I can really make a lot of money . Enoughto have changed everything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solemnly , you 're perfectly wokNo , I 'm not , ' said Agnes . I 'm just a worker . ' You 're always right , ' said Jane . But not wonderful , ' smiled Agnes . Jimmy was wonderful . And always wrong . Oh , Jane ! ' Agnes 's smile was veil tremulous . Would n't you know that Jimmy would fight with the Germans and die a hero 's death on the wrong side of the Marne ? Jimmy was on the wrong side of every M fne from the day he was born ! ' But always wonderful , ' smiled Jane . And aways the hero . ' To me , ' said Agnes gently . To me , too , ' said Jane . P385KAxo , ' said Isabel , is just as good as sugar . . In cake you ca n't tell the difference . ' The morning sunshine was slanting in the wide dusty windows of the Chicago skyscraper . The big bare room was hung with Red Cross posters and filled with long deal tables and crowded with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caterer 's folding chairs around the tables , meticulously pressing small squares of cheesecloth into intricatelymitred rectangles . Isabel was working the bandage roller at the head of the first table . Muriel , at her elbow , looked up from her gauze sponges . But is it fattening ? ' she asked . Everything good is fattening , ' said Isabel with a little sigh of resignation . Jane smiled as she heard her . She knew that Isabel , at forty-six , did not really care much any longer if everything good was . But Muriel , at forty-one , still cared a great deal . She was constantly repressing a slightly Semitic tendency toward rounded curves . She was still awfully pretty , Jane thought . Her blue eyes had never lost that trick of dancing . They were dancing now , as she responded lightly : The women of this country have done a great deal for Herbert Hoover . I think the least he can do for them is to offer a few reducing food substitutes . '  | Isabel did not join in the laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seriously deplored Muriel 's tendency to be frivolous about the war . Jack had been nine months in training now at Camp Brant in Rockford . Albert was there , too , of course . The boys had left Harvard together as soon as war was declared and had joined the first R.O.T.C. at Fort Sheridan . They would undoubtedly be shipped to France before the summer was over . Isabel and Robin took the war very seriously . They were terribly worried about Jack . As far as they were concerned , it was just Jack 's war . Though he was still safely detailed to shoot machine guns over an Illinois prairie , Jane knew that Isabel was always thinking of him lying dead or wounded on a French battle-field . Every bandage she was rolling that morning in the big bare room on top of the Chicago skyscraperwas turned out with a sense of personal service for her son . Muriel was worried about Albert , too , of course . But she took a vicarious pride in his military exploits . She loved to have him gracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , looking decorative and dedicated and dapper in his second lieutenant 's uniform . Albert Lancasterwas a very beautiful young man and he was very fond of his mother . In the presence of Muriel 's other beautiful young men he always flirted with her , very flatteringly . Jane had sometimes felt that Muriel was just a little in love with him . She had said as much one day to Isabel at their mother'sluncheon-table . Now , Jane , ' Isabel had responded airily , do n't suggest that Muriel is going to add incest to her list of crimes ! ' Mrs. Ward had said they should not talk like that . With Bert in the helpless condition he was , it was very natural for Muriel to centre her affections on her only son . P387If she only did ! ' had been Isabel 's telling comment . Muriel had been very capable about the war , however , in spite of her frivolity . She had organized the Red Cross circle on top of the Chicago skyscraper . She had ordered the supplies and enrolled the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them the- room rent free . She was a member of the countless Food Administration and National Council of Defence committees . Nevertheless , Isabel deplored her frivolity . Muriel did not care . She just went on being frivolous . At the moment she was making airy little jokes about the sunny side of being a famine victim . Jane soon ceased to listen . From her seat near the window she could look out over the roofs of the smaller office buildings toward the east , past the slender silhouette of the MontgomeryWard Tower , across the desert wastes of Grant Park , to the Illinois Central switchyards , where the miniature engines , dwarfed by distance , pulled their toy trains and belched their black smoke and puffed their white steam up into the serene face of the May sky . Beyond them stretched the sparkling blue plane that was the lake . A lovely day , reflected Jane , idly . A lovely day , with a bright spring sun and a stiff east breeze to sweep the city clean . Her hands still busy mechanically folding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little , at the golden orb that shone dazzlingly down on the city roofs above the gilded Diana that topped the Tower . What had that sun seen , she was thinking , since it had last sunk behind the murk of the stockyards , since she herself , staring from that same window , had watched its dying rays paint the Montgomery Ward Diana with rosy fire ? The words of the Stevenson nursery rhyme she had so often repeated to the children , when they were little , came into her mind.  |p388The  sun is not abed when IAt night upon my pillow lie , But round the earth his way he takes And morning after morning makes . ' One morning here on the Chicago lake front . A few hours earlier a very different one on the battle-fields of France . The battle-fields that would so soon swallow up Isabel 's Jack and Muriel 's Albert . But the battle-fields that still , in May , 1918 , almost four years after Jimmy 's death , achieved for Jane their major significance as Jimmy 's last resting-place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realize the war . It had remained for her the supremely irrelevant accidentthat had killed him . An act of God , like a casual stroke of lightning . Or perhaps an act of man , like the blow of a death-dealing taxi , turning too quickly on a policeman 's whistle , to crush an absent-minded pedestrian under its indifferentwheels . Jimmy had not died for Germany , in spite of his Prussian helmet . He had not died for her , in spite of his love . He had died  --  for fun , perhaps , as he had lived . Died true to his creed embraced in night school , in a supreme desire to be present always at the focus where the greatest number of vital forces unite in their purest energy . ' Jimmy had died for Pater , as much as for anything ! Strange end for a hedonist . You grew accustomed to pain , thought Jane . You really did . Even to pain like hers over Jimmy , that was so sharp , so constant , so distinctly localized that she almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You grew wise and philosophicalabout it . You generalized . You struggled for resignation . In her struggles for resignation , Jane knew that she was sometimes guilty of the great injustice to Jimmy of wondering if it were n't all better so . Better so , she tried to think she meant , because of Agnes and little Agnes , who were living onp389the proceeds of Agnes 's third play so much more comfortably with Jimmy 's memory than they could ever have lived in his restless , unhappy presence . Jane tried to think she meant that , but really she knew she was thinking only of herself and of the intolerable problems a future , with or without a living Jimmy , had propounded . For death had given her Jimmy . He had died loving her . He had died with that love unsullied and unspoiled . Would he have lived to love her always ? Few men were capable of that . Would she have lived to see him grow indifferent , remote , concerned , perhaps , oh , vitally concerned ! with some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future held no fears . Time , changing relationships , distance , estrangement  --  all these were powerless . She could dismiss that fearful question as to whether she had ever really , in her secret heart , wanted Jimmy to go back to Agnes . She could dismiss her vague forebodings on the world of women that waited for him if he did n't . She could dismiss the thought of Stephen . You could love the dead without disloyalty to the living . Nevertheless , it was an act of treachery to Jimmy 's memory to allow herself to think , even for a moment , that he was betterdead . Jimmy  --  dead . The thought was still incredible . She had never lost the illusion of his laughing , living presence . He was the constant companion of her reveries . He would be laughing now , if he could read her thoughts . Laughing at her involuntary sense of guilt . Invincible innocent ! ' would be his ironical comment . You could not shock Jimmy . And he always mocked you when you shocked yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ theory that he had made everything much easier for every one by passing , so opportunely , out of the picture . He would have prided himself on the felicitous gesture . He would have admired his romantic role.  | Yet Jimmy had not wanted to die . He had said as much , very definitely , in that last letter he had written her . Not that he hoped much from the future . But he had no fear of it . Jimmy accepted life on its face value . He lived for the moment . Sudden death . At thirty-five . Before you knew the answer to any of life 's riddles . Perhaps you never knew that , though . Perhaps there was no answer . Perhaps all lives , at any age , ended like Jimmy 's on an unresolved chord . What difference did it make , anyway , once you were safely dead ? It did not make any difference , if you had played the game and had done what you had to do and had never really regretted it . But there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking . Thinking , in spite of Stephen , whom you loved , and the children , whom you adored , and all the little practical things you had to do every day , like folding sponges for the Red Cross . Why could n't she feel the war more keenly ? With the maps still hung on the living-room wall and Stephen immersed in Liberty Loan campaigns , and Jack and Albert always about the house on their leaves from Camp Brant , and Cicily and Jenny and Isabel 's little Belle out every day in Red Cross uniforms , feeding hot dogs and coffee to the entrained doughboys at the canteens in the city switchyards ? They felt the war keenly enough  --  Cicily and Jenny and little Belle . They were all eager to go to France with the boys from Camp Brant . Cicily wanted to drive an ambulance . Under age , thank Heaven ! She and Stephen would not have to face that problem . Uncle Sam , a less yielding relation than two indulgent parents , could be relied upon to keep the girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with little Steve still only fourteen the war could not touch her immediate family.  |p391Isabel  was talking of Crisco , now . She was saying it could never take the place of butter . Jane rose from her seat abruptly . She had promised to meet Cicily at Marshall Field 's at noon . They were going to look for a new evening gown . Jack and Albert were coming down for the next week-end . Cicily and Belle were planning a party . IIBut you 're children , ' said Stephen . Oh , Dad , ' said Cicily , with a tolerant smile , be your age ! ' Jane looked from Stephen to her twinkling daughter . Stephen was sitting in his armchair in the Lakewood livingroom . The Evening Post , ' which had fallen from his hands a moment before at Cicily 's astounding announcement , lay on the floor at his feet . He was gazing at Cicily with an expression of mingled incredulity and consternation . Cicily , her hand thrust casually through Jack Bridges 's arm , was standing-on the hearthrug . She looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disheartened . She looked , indeed , just as she always did , like a yellow dandelion , with her tempestuous bobbed head of golden excelsior . The severity of her khaki uniform with its Red Cross insignia enhanced her flower-like charm . It was the common clay from which the flower had sprung . She looked as fresh as a dandelion , and as indifferent and as irresponsible . Jack Bridges was in khaki , too , with the crossed rifles of the infantryman on his collar and the gold bar of the second lieutenant on his shoulders . He had come down yesterday for that week-end 's leave from Camp Brant at Rockford . He had just learned that he was sailing for France in six weeks , with the Eighty-Sixth Division . Jack did not look at all disheartened , either , but not quiteP392as cool as Cicily , nor nearly as indifferent nor as much amused . He looked just like Robin , Jane thought , with his pleasant snub-nosed smile and his friendly pale blue eyes . He was glancing at Stephen a trifle apologetically , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not have seen this was coming ? ' thought Jane . We 're not children , Dad , ' continued Cicily with a pleasant smile . I was nineteen in February and Jack will be twentytwoin July . We 're both well out of the perambulator ! ' I know just how you feel , sir , ' said Jack sympathetically , and I dare say , in a way , you 're right . If it were n't for the war , I do n't suppose we would be getting married . If it were n't for the war I 'd be going to Tech all next winter and Cicily would be buzzing about the tea-fights at home . Still , she 'd soon be marrying some one else , you know . I 'd never have had the nerve to ask a girl like Cicily to wait for me . If it were n't for the war , I 'd be just an " also ran " ! ' Was n't fought in vain , was it , Jacky ? ' said Cicily , pinchinghis elbow . He kissed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' startled eyes . I would n't expect to keep Cicily waiting at the church very long , even in war-time , ' said Jack  --  Jane caught the note of humility behind his levity  --  so we thought ' Jack ! ' said Cicily . Do n't put it like that ! We do n't think  --  we know ! We 're going to get married , Dad , on the last day of June and have a two weeks ' honeymoon before he sails for France . ' Cicily , ' said Jane , you 're much too young . You have n't had any experience . You ca n't know your own mind . The war has been fearfully upsetting , I know , for your generation . But you 're still a child . Oh  --  I know you 've been home a year from Rosemary ! But what sort of a year has it been ? P393Just war work  --  and Jack . Not even a proper debut . He was here every evening last summer when he was at Fort Sheridan in the R.O.T.C. And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and motoring up to see him and planning to get him down here on leave ! You 've never looked at another man ' Why had n't she seen this was coming ? It was all so terribly clear in retrospect . You ca n't get married , ' said Stephen firmly , before Jack goes to France . ' You married Mumsy , ' said Cicily sweetly , before you went to Cuba . ' That was very different , ' said Jane . Why was it different ? ' said Cicily . Because your father was twenty-nine years old , ' said Jane decidedly , and I was twenty-one and I 'd been home from college for two years and I 'd known lots of men and  --  ' Well , I bet if you 'd wanted to marry the first man you looked at you 'd have done it ! ' said Cicily . A sudden-flood of memories swept over Jane . Her father 's library on Pine Street . Her mother , shrill and effective . Her father , kind and competent . Herself and Andre , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a world of young emotion lying shattered at their feet . But this generationwas different . No trace even of anxiety in Cicily 's amused smile . Anyway , I 'm going to . We 're not asking you , Mumsy , we 're telling you ! It 's all settled . Belle 's talking to Aunt Isabel this minuteBelle ? ' questioned Jane . Belle and Albert , ' said Cicily . Albert Lancaster . He 's told his mother . We 're going to have a double wedding , here in the garden , the last day of June . ' A double wedding ! ' cried Jane and Stephen at once.  | Yes , ' said Cicily calmly . Do you think the roses will be out ? We 've planned for everything . Why , Jenny 's known about it for two weeks . She 's going to be bridesmaid for both of us . Just Jenny  --  but lots of ushers , with crossed swords , you know . Belle and I are going to cut the cakes with Albert 's and Jack 's sabres @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly preposterous ! Aunt Isabel will never listen to you ! Why , Belle 's only eighteen ! Albert 's not yet twenty . ' He will be in August , ' said Cicily . I do n't see why you carry on about it like this . I do n't see why you do n't think it 's all very sweet and touching . Belle 's been my best friend all my life and now I 'm marrying her brother and she 's marrying the son of one of your best friends and ' In the first place , ' said Stephen , you 're all first cousins . ' Albert is n't anybody 's first cousin , ' said Cicily pertly . So that lets Belle out . And as for Jack and me  --  that 's all right . We looked it all up in Havelock Ellis . There 's no danger in consanguinity if there is n't an hereditary taint in the family . We 've been awfully eugenic , Mumsy ! We 've simply scoured the connection for an hereditary taint ! And we have n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I 'd hate to have a short-sighted baby  --  but maybe I would n't as it 's not in the common line . Anyway , there 's no insanity , nor epilepsy , nor cancer , nor T.B. , nor venereal disease  --  ' Cicily , ' said Stephen a little hastily , you do n't know what you 're talking about ' Cicily dropped Jack 's arm and sank down on the arm of her father 's chair . She kissed the bald spot on top of his head very tenderly . Dad , dear , ' she said very sweetly , perhaps we do n't . Perhapsyou did n't know just what you were talking about whenp395you wanted to marry Mumsy . But still you did it . You did it and you went to war and it all came out all right . Ca n't you remember how you felt when you wanted to marry Mumsy  --  ? ' Across the dandelion head Stephen 's eyes met Jane 's . What are we going to do with them , Jane ? ' he said , with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Jane very practically , at the moment . We 'll talk it over with Isabel and Robin . And Muriel , of course . I do n't suppose Bert understands much , any more , of what goes on around him , but Muriel 's always decidedCicily jumped to her feet and threw her arms around Jane 's neck . That 's a good Mumsy ! ' she cried . Then , turning to Jack , Come out in the garden , old thing ! The apple tree 's still in bloom ! ' She seized his hand and turned toward the terrace doors . Cicily , ' said Jane doubtfully , nothing is settled . I do n't quite like  --  Cicily burst into indulgent laughter . What do you think I am , Mumsy ? ' she inquired cheerfully . Sweet nineteen and never been kissed ? Oh , you are precious  --  both of you ! ' She tossed a kiss to her parents on the hearthrugand dragged Jack from the room . Jane watched their slim , young , khaki-clad figures romp down the lawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jane , it 's a very different generation . But what are we going to do ? ' I 'm going to remember , ' said Stephen , rising from his chair , how I felt when I wanted to marry Mumsy ! ' He took her hand in his . Dear old Stephen ! His eyes were just a little moist behind his bone-rimmed spectacles . Jane kissed him very tenderly.  |p396Just  the same , ' said Jane , I was n't a bit like Cicily . ' You were just as sweet , ' said Stephen , and nearly as young . ' But I was different , ' said Jane . I know I was different . ' She sighed a little as she slipped from Stephen 's embrace . Well  --  we 'll see what Isabel has to say , ' she said . IIII do n't see why , ' said Isabel , you object to Cicily 's marryingJack . Poor child , he 's going to war next month . He may be killed ' Her lip was trembling . Well , ' said Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's marrying Albert . He 's going to war next month and he may be killed . ' Muriel 's lip was not trembling . Her voice was as logical as her statement . Belle 's younger , ' said Isabel . Only a year , ' said Jane . And Belle 's different , ' said Isabel . Cicily 's always equal to any situation . She 's so much more dominating . Cicily 's one of the people you know will always come out on top . And Jack adores her . He 's always adored her . ' Well , Albert 's one of the people you know will always come out on top , ' said Muriel . I 'm sure he 's very dominating . And he 's very much in love with Belle . I ca n't see why they should n't be very happy . ' Of course , ' said Isabel , producing her handkerchief , neither of them may ever come home from France . ' But again they may , ' said Jane a trifle cynically . If they do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not really hurt any one . But if they do , they 'll have to live with each other for another fifty years or so . ' It 's very easy to see , ' said Isabel reproachfully , from the depths of the handkerchief , that you have n't given a son to the nation . '  |p397Jane  felt a little ashamed of her cynical utterance . It was all wrong , however , to confuse the practical issues with sentimentality . They had been discussing the problem for hours in the Lakewood living-room . Robin and Isabel and Muriel had come out for dinner in order to discuss it , and now it was half-past ten and they were no nearer a solution than they had been at seven . Robin and Stephen had said very little all evening . Jane and Muriel and Isabel had said a great deal . But from the very beginning of the argument , Jane had been conscious of a fundamental difference between her point of view and that of the mothers of the prospective bridegrooms . Isabel and Muriel were staunchly united @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before they went to the front . Those young lives , ' said Isabel , now frankly sobbing , may end in another two months . We owe those boys all the fulfilmentwe can give them . ' Of course , however , she did not want Belle to marry Albert Lancaster . ' Logic had never been Isabel 's strong point . She wanted Cicily to marry Jack and Belle to consent to an engagement . Albert would not be twenty until the first of August . And twenty was a preposterous age for a husband . Jane could easily understand , however , if Isabel could n't , why pretty little pink-and-white Belle wanted to marry him . Albert Lancaster was a very alluring young person . He seemed quite grown up . He seemed older than Jack , in fact , who was two years his senior . He had inherited his father 's easy social charm and combined it with his mother 's dark beauty . Not that Albert really looked like Muriel . He looked like her family , however , though not at all like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Golden Age , with his pale , olive-coloured face , his dark eyes and hair , his aquiline nose , his short supercilious Greek lip , and his flat , low Greek brow  --  a discus-thrower , perhaps , or runner  --  no , thought Jane , more like a youthful Bacchus . You felt that vine leaves would adorn his hair . They sometimes did , of course . That was probably one of the things that was troubling Isabel . Naturallyshe could not go into that in front of Muriel . Oh , yes  --  Jane could quite understand why Belle wanted to marry him . Now Jack , on the other hand , Jack who looked just like Robin  --  Jack with his snub nose and pleasant friendly twinkle  --  Jack who had played with Cicily from her cradle  --  why did Cicily want to marry him ? He was a sweet boy , of course . Clever and kindly and considerate . A much safer son-in-law than Albert Lancaster , with his looks and his inheritanceand his vine leaves ! But still  --  Jane really could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't see what either of you object to in either marriage , ' said Muriel . We 're all old friends . We 've known all four children from the day of their birth . There 's plenty of money . Cicily and Belle are charming girls and best friends . The boys have both been to Harvard and are going to war and are very attractive young men . My goodness ! When you think what some people 's children marry ! I ca n't see why it 's not all very suitable . ' But Muriel , they 're children , ' put in Stephen from the depths of his armchair . Kids , ' said Robin solemnly , from the corner of the sofa . I do n't care , ' said Muriel . I was only just twenty when I married , myself . And I 've often thought , ' she continued superbly , that life would have been quite a little easier for me if Bert had n't been nineteen years older than I. I believe in early marriages . I think they keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is forming . And a girl has her babies early and gets through with all that sort of thing when she 's still young enough to enjoy herself ' P399But that 's just what 's dangerous about them ! ' wailed Isabel . Jane knew she had it on the tip of her tongue to say , Look at you , Muriel ! ' Time was when she would have said it . Isabel was growing discreet with age . I think you 're very cynical , ' said Muriel . I think it would be lovely  --  a double wedding , Jane , in your beautiful garden ' In any case , ' said Isabel , I think Belle should be married from her father 's house . It 's very sweet of you , Jane , to offer --  " I have n't offered ! ' cried Jane . I have n't done anything all evening but say we should n't let them . The boys will be sailing in six weeks  --  ' She saw , instantly , that she had not helped her cause at all . Isabel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to the charge . If little Steve were twenty , instead of fourteen , Jane , you would n't be so unfeeling ! ' That was quite true , reflected Jane . If little Steve were the age to make suitable cannon fodder , she would want him to have everything , everything life had to give , before he went to France . I suppose , ' said Isabel , wiping her eyes , I suppose we 'll have to give in . ' Of course we will , ' said Muriel briskly . Then added piously , My greatest regret is that dear Bert is n't able to share in Albert 's happiness . ' How is he now , Muriel ? ' asked Isabel curiously . For a moment the war weddings were forgotten . Oh  --  quite helpless , ' said Muriel . In bed , of course . He ca n't talk and I do n't know how much he does understand . He has two very good nurses , however . Such pretty girls . I hope Bert can realize how pretty they are  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more important issues ,  | you do n't mean you think we 've lost the fight ? You do n't mean you think we ought to let them ? ' How can we help it ? ' said Isabel . But about the double wedding Oh , I think that would be lovely ! ' said Muriel again . Your apartment is so small , Isabel , and June 's so pretty in the country . If Jane will take it off your hands  --  ' I wo n't take it off her hands , ' said Jane . Anyway , I think we ought n't to decide until we 've talked it all over with Papa . ' Oh  --  Papa ! ' said Isabel doubtfully . You know how Papa is , Jane . He 's really quite  --  difficult , sometimes . The war has aged him awfully . ' I do n't think he 's difficult , ' said Jane . I think he 's very wise . And I think we ought to talk with Mrs. Lester . ' Well , Jane , ' said Muriel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's wonderful and she adores Albert , but I often think she 's a little out of sympathy with the modern generation . Rather critical , I mean . ' Mamma 's terribly critical , ' said Isabel . Sometimes I think she just hates her grandchildren . ' She does n't understand them , ' said Jane . But she loves them . And Papa adores them . He 's always been so proud of Jack , Isabel  --  with the name and all . ' Then he ought to want to see him happy , ' said Isabel . She rose with a sigh as she spoke . Come on , Muriel , we must be getting back to town . ' What doyou think , Robin ? ' asked Jane . You have n't said a word all evening . ' I think it 's fierce , ' said Robin solemnly . Like life . ' But what can we do ? ' persisted Jane . Nothing , probably , ' said Robin . Again like life . ' Jane slipped her arm through Stephen 's . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ P40IWell  --  I 'll talk to Belle again , ' said Isabel . Perhaps she 'll listen to reason . And I 'll write to Jack at Rockford before I go to bed to-night . ' I 'm going to wire Albert , ' said Muriel . A very hopeful wire . I think he needs cheering . ' I 'll take it up with Cicily , ' said Jane . And Stephen wants to talk to her . But I know it wo n't do a bit of good . ' Good-night , ' said Isabel , from the depths of the motor . Button up your coat , Robin . It 's a cold evening for June . ' Good-night , ' said Jane . The motor crunched slowly around the gravel curve of the driveway . Jane turned to Stephen . Stephen , ' she said , what will we do ? ' Let nature take its course , I guess , ' said Stephen grimly . You did n't get much help from Isabel . ' Was n't Muriel terrible ? ' said Jane . Did you hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes , ' said Stephen , turning back to the front door . I 'm glad : it 's not Albert , ' said Jane solemnly , as she entered the hall . I 'm awfully sorry for Isabel . I could n't bear it , Stephen , really , I could n't bear it , if Cicily were going to marry Bert Lancaster 's son . ' It 's pretty rough all right , ' said Stephen . I 'm sorry for Robin . ' He 's always adored Belle , ' said Jane . I 've always adored Cicily , ' said Stephen . I know , ' said Jane . But we like Jack . ' He 's a nice kid , ' said Stephen . But as a husband for Cicily I know , ' said Jane . They stood for a moment , gazing rather helplessly into each other 's eyes . Well , ' said Stephen , turning to bolt the front door , we 'd better go up to bed . I 'll turn out the lights . '   He went back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still overcome with a sense of inadequacy for not having foreseen this calamity . But who could have foreseenit ? It was perfectly preposterous . What was the matter with the rising generation ? What was the matter with her own ? She thought again of herself and Andre . Of her father and mother . She felt she sympathized with them , as never before . But with Cicily , too , when she thought of Andre . First love  --  was there not a bloom about it that never came again ? What would her life have been if she had married Andre ? If she had married Andre would he seem now like Stephen ? If she had married Andre she would never have loved Jimmy . She would never have known Jimmy . Jimmy would be alive now , married to Agnes , living in New York . Jane could not imagine her life without her love for Jimmy . Without her marriage to Stephen , for that matter . Yet when she thought of Andre and of her young self as she had been that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life  --  how confusing it all was ! A chaos of conflictingloyalties ! You would like to think , of course , that you were the sort of woman who was capable of experiencing , once and forever , a central , dominating passion . But as far as the essential sense of emotional intimacy went , she might as well be Andre 's wife , or Jimmy 's , that moment , as Stephen 's . Why had things turned out as they had ? Predestination was probably the answer . Cause and effect . One thing leading to another . Free will was only a delusion . Why not turn fatalist , pure and simple , and not worry any longer ? Not care . But you had to care about your children . Worry about them , too . You had to and you ought to . When you thought of them all theories of predestination were completely shattered . Jane turned to smile at Stephen , as he entered the bluep403bedroom . He looked terribly tired and quite a little discouraged , but he gave her an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' said Jane very seriously , the more I admire your technique as a parent . ' That 's very flattering of you , Kid , ' said Mr. Ward with a twinkle . Why , Isabel and I never gave you and Mamma any trouble , ' Jane went on , still very seriously . Oh , I do n't know about that , Kid , ' interrupted Mr. Ward . You went to Bryn Mawr over your mother 's dead bodyOh  --  Bryn Mawr ! ' threw in Jane contemptuously . It seemed very important at the time , ' said Mr. Ward . She thought it would damn you to eternal spinsterhood . And before that you had embarked at the age of seventeen on a clandestine engagement It was n't clandestine ! ' protested Jane . We told you right away ! ' Yes , you did , ' admitted Mr. Ward , with his indulgent twinkle . You were very good children . Still  --  it was a bit disquietingThey were sitting side by side on the old brown velvet sofa in the Pine Street library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ window , striking the glass bookcase doors and making them look a little dusty , just as it always had from time immemorial . The firelight was dancing on the shiny surfaces of polished walnut , here and there in the darker corners , and shining on the big brass humidor on the desk that held Mr. Ward 's cigars . Mr. Ward always had a fire , now , even in summer . The room was hotter than it used to be and the big branching rubber tree in the west window was gone.  |p404Otherwise  everything about the Pine Street library was completelyunchanged . Everything , that is , but Mr. Ward himself . Jane , looking tenderly across the sofa at her father , was suddenly conscious of how old and frail he seemed . Isabel was right . The was had aged him . Or perhaps it was his retirement from business that had taken place two years before . Mr. Ward lived , now , in his little brown library . When Jane dropped in , she always found him there , settled comfortably in his leather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news , or perhaps just smoking , reflectively , a solitary cigar . The room was really very warm . Jane looked at the smoulderingfire . Her glance , wandering casually over the familiar mantel-shelf , met the Bard of Avon 's wise mahogany eye . The Bard of Avon always made her think of her wedding ceremony . Papa , ' said Jane , how can you tell , how can you possibly tell , just whom your children ought to marry ? ' You ca n't , ' said Mr. Ward promptly . But you can make a pretty good guess at whom they ought not to . ' But how can you stop them ? ' said Jane . I do n't know , ' said Mr. Ward very seriously after a little pause . You stopped me , ' said Jane . You stopped me because you made me feel , somehow or other , though I did n't agree with you , that you were inevitably right . Right , because you were my father . That 's what 's gone out of the family relationship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are right any longer , just because you are a parent . ' Well , you 're not , ' said Mr. Ward promptly . That 's probably a step in the right direction , Kid . What 's known as progress . ' Well , it makes life terribly difficult for parents , ' sighed Jane . P405And I ca n't help thinking it may make life terribly difficult for children . ' Life 's terribly difficult at times for every one , ' said Mr. Ward . A little thing like filial obedience does n't solve all the problems . ' When I think of the ex cathedra pronouncements that Mamma used to make ! ' cried Jane . Why , I never thought of questioning them ! ' And were they always right ? ' asked Mr. Ward . They were usually wrong , ' said Jane . But at least they stopped discussion and they decided the issue . Parents used to be just like umpires . All they had to do was to make a decisionand stick to it ! ' It was n't an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't question it when it was in fashion , ' retorted Jane . You did n't have the slightest hesitation in forbidding me to marry Andre . But we loved each other . We truly did , Papa . You never really took that into consideration . I might have been very happy as Andre 's wife . ' Mr. Ward 's glance was just a little intent as he contemplatedhis younger daughter . You 've been very happy as Stephen 's wife , Kid , ' he said gently . Yes , ' said Jane uncertainly . Words were too crude to definethe subtleties of emotion . Yes , I 've been happy . But my marrying him was awfully irrelevant . ' Suddenly that statement seemed terribly disloyal to Stephen . You know , Papa , ' she said in extenuation , a war changed everything in my life . ' There was a pause , for a moment , in the sunlit room . Jane did not look at her father , but she knew , without looking , from his sudden , breathless silence that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized then that her words were open to misinterpretation . She glanced quickly up at him . He was shocked . He looked at her a moment a little uncertainly . Then , Which war , Jane ? ' he asked steadily . She was awfully glad that he had put the direct question . In answering it she could answer all the unspoken questions that had been worrying him for the last four years . The Spanish one , ' she said gravely . The other did n't  --  did n't really affect my action . I mean  --  I mean it was all settled before ' Her voice was failing her . She could not bear to mention Jimmy 's name . I 'm glad to hear it , Kid , ' said her father gently . He understood . She would not have to mention it . Jane drew a long breath and felt the emotional tension of the moment snap as she did so . She could return now to the problems of the younger generation . All I mean is , ' she went on brightly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will bring your children happiness ? Perhaps they ought to decide for themselves As she spoke , Mrs. Ward opened the library door . Isabel followed her into the room . They had been talking together in Mrs. Ward 's bedroom . Well , I hope you 've convinced Jane that she must put her foot down , ' said Mrs. Ward briskly . Her hand was on the bell-rope to summon Minnie to bring in the tea . Mamma , you do n't know what it 's like to handle Belle and Cicily , ' said Isabel wearily . I handled you and Jane ! ' retorted Mrs. Ward . And very foolish you often were ! If it had n't been for your father and meJane and her father burst simultaneously into irreverent laughter . Mrs. Ward looked quite offended . You do n't make it any easier , John , to control the grandchildren , ' she said severely . P407I 've retired , ' said Mr. Ward , when he had subdued his laughter . From my family as from my business . At seventytwoI 'm glad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jane . ' vJenny 's really so homely , ' said Cicily frankly , that I think we ought to feature it . ' Feature it ? ' questioned Flora . Yes , ' said Cicily , make her look quaint , you know ; as if she were meant to be funny . ' The first duty of a bridesmaid , in any case , ' said Muriel , is to look less pretty than the bride . ' No one could help looking less pretty than these brides , ' said Flora , with a glance from Belle to Cicily . Isabel looked pleased . Jane felt herself smiling . Jenny did not seem at all insulted by her sister 's candour . They were all sitting in Flora 's hat shop . They had just decided on the model for the wedding veils and were now discussingthe bridesmaid 's hat . Flora 's hat shop was doing a booming business . It had been just about to die of inanition three years ago when the Belgianbabies came along and gave it a new lease of life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to her to change it into a war charity . Aux Armes des Allies , ' she had rechristened it , and pasted French war posters all over the cubistic designs of the coach-house . She had charged fantasticprices and had really made a great deal of money . She had photographs of all the Belgian babies she supported , on the walls of the fitting-rooms . In spite of the submarines she made semi-annual trips to Paris for the hats and the photographs . She was a member of several French relief committeesand so managed to get a passport . When Mr. Furness diedP408two years before , she had given large sums to the funds for war orphans . She had made a great many French friends and was talking , now , of going to live in Paris when the war was over  --  if it ever was . She would like a little apartment out near Passy . But now she was discussing the bridesmaid 's hat . I think , ' she said critically , backing away from Jenny and looking fixedly at her plain little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think  --  a poke bonnet . Yes , Jane ! A pink poke bonnet  --  very pale . You 're right , Cicily , she must be quaint ! A hooped skirt , Isabel , a pink hooped skirt , with little garlands around it and a sweet , tight little bodice . Pale pink taffeta , do n't you think , Muriel ? And a little 186o bouquet with ribbon streamers and a white lace frill . Oh , Jenny , my dear , you 'll be charming ! We 'll emphasize your angles . You 'll look like a cross-stitched design on a sampler ! How old are you ? ' Sixteen , ' said Jenny meekly . You do n't look it , ' said Flora . Do you think , Jane , that pantalettes would be going too far ? ' Jane thought they would . I suppose you 're right , ' said Flora , though I always think a wedding should be primarily a pageant . This one will be lovely . The hot weather will bring out all the roses . What are you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bride always wear ? ' said Jane ironically . Beige chiffon , of course . I did n't think I had any choice . ' And Isabel , too ? ' said Flora critically . Well , no . Now that I think of it , Isabel is a mother of a bride and she 's wearing grey . ' Muriel 's dress is lovely , ' said Flora . I 'm making her hat . Mauve . Let me make yours , Jane . For Heaven 's sake , get a good one , for once ! '  |p409All  right , ' said Jane indifferently . I 'd be glad not to have to bother about it . ' We 've got to go , ' said Cicily . We 're going down to Crichton 's with Aunt Isabel to pick out my tea-set . ' I chose Belle 's yesterday , ' said Muriel as she rose . It 's lovely , ' said Isabel . It seems just a moment ago that you were choosing your own . ' I know , ' said Muriel . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dresses . They were pretty . ' Jane thought of Flora 's blue bridesmaid 's dress lying crumpled on her bedroom chair the morning after her mother 's death . She thought of herself hanging it up in Flora 's closet , while Flora dressed in the little black frock that Mrs. Lester had brought over . She wondered if Flora were thinking of it , too . But Flora 's face was very tranquil . Fittings for all of you , Wednesday morning , ' she said . I ' 11 have a beige model here , Jane , for you to look at . ' They all went out of the brown-stone stable and stood for a moment in the old carriage court . The Furnesses ' back yard looked just as it always had . Flora had the playhouse painted every year . But the houses across Rush Street had all been rented to business firms . Dressmakers and milliners and decorators had signs over every door . The clean frilled lace curtains and evenly drawn shades in Flora 's Victorian mansionseemed strangely out of place in their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's lace curtainslooked just like her mother 's  --  just as clean and just as frilly and just as Victorian . She kept the old place up beautifully . She even kept the orange tree blooming in the conservatory . But if she were going to live in ParisJane sighed . It did not seem to her just a moment ago that she had tried on Muriel 's blue bridesmaid 's dress . P410VIJane stood at Isabel 's side in the front row of the little congregationthat had gathered in the rose garden . On her other hand , pressed close against the tightly drawn white satin ribbon , stood little Steve . Little Steve , at fourteen , was taller than his mother and looked exactly like his father . He was wearing his first long white flannel trousers , and Jane knew that he considered the occasion of the double wedding mainly important as his debut into man 's estate . Behind Jane stood Mr. and Mrs. Ward and Alden Carver , the only representative of the Carver family who had come West for the wedding . Mr. and Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both over seventy . Silly had stayed at Gull Rocks to look after them . Across the grassy aisle , Muriel , radiant under the new mauve hat , rested one graceful mauve arm on the back of Mrs. Lester 's wheel-chair . Rosalie and Edith , once more imported from Cleveland for a family festival , supported their mother on the other side . Mrs. Lester , herself , colossal in shiny black taffeta , blinked like a wrinkled sibyl in the brilliantJune sunshine . There was something a little sinister about her massive , motionless figure . Her aged face , under her mantilla cap of black lace , looked like a mask of tan wax . The wrinkles , the salient nose , the cascade of double chins might have been a clever sculptor 's effigy of old age . Only the eyelids moved . Her bright dark eyes glittered behind them with a gleam of helpless intelligence that seemed imprisoned in the motionless mask . Mrs. Lester had deplored these marriages . Behind the two families the garden was filled with guests . The orchestra beyond the clump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tipperary ' into the first sentimental notes of the Barcarolle from the Tales of Hoff/mann . ' Muriel had requested it . It had been played at her wedding . Jane and Isabel had thought that the less this wedding was like Muriel 's the better . Nevertheless , they had conceded the Barcarolle . Jane stood motionless , her eyes on the arch of Dorothy Perkins roses under which the clergyman would soon appear . It was outlined against the pure blue of the June sky . High overhead one white cloud floated , a flying dome of alabaster , above the improvised altar . The clergyman was in ambush , behind the hedge with Jack and Albert and their attendant groomsmen , waiting for the bridal party to appear at the other end of the garden . Jane wondered why they did not come . She had kissed Cicily and arranged her train , just before walking up the aisle . She wished she could lean out , like Steve , over the white satin ribbons , and see whether anythinghad gone wrong . As she was wondering , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swelled into Lohengrin . ' The clergyman , with the promptness of a marionette , swung out in white vestmentsunder the arch of pink bloom . The four young men in khaki followed him . Jane heard Isabel catch her breath sharply at the sight of Jack . She saw Albert smile in selfconsciousreassurance at Muriel across the aisle . Jack was staring straight down the grassy path , waiting for his first glimpse of Cicily . The first pair of khaki-clad ushers passed slowly by Jane . Then the second . Then the third . Then Jenny , successfully quaint , in her ridiculous hoopskirt . Her pale , plain little face was barely visible in the depths of Flora 's poke bonnet . What Jane could see of it looked intenselyserious . Her hands shook a little as they gripped the 186o bouquet . Her knuckles were white . She turned to face the congregation just as Belle passed by , a cloud of floating tulle , on Robin 's arm . Albert stepped out to meet her . Then Jane saw Cicily , another cloud , her head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand on Stephen 's elbow . She must have smiled at Jack . His funny snub-nosed face reflected the radiance of that smile . The Lohengrin ' faded away into silence . The clergyman took up the ritual . Dearly beloved brethren , we are met together in the sight of God and this company  --  ' In the sight of God . Was God really present , thought Jane , this sunny June afternoon , looking at them all , in her familiar Lakewood garden ? Did God have time to take in all the weddings , or did He pick and choose ? Did He sometimes withhold His blessing ? Could God be summoned peremptorilyto any altar ? Did He never have another engagement ? Was He not too busy this afternoon , for instance , on the battle-fields of France , to look in on this little ceremony in a Lakewood garden ? The clergyman 's voice droned on. '  --  the holy estate of matrimony , which is an honorable estate , instituted of God in the time of man 's innocenceIn the time of man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for weddings . Jane thought fleetingly of Andre . Of herself in his arms . These four children were innocent enough . Too innocent . That was the difficulty . Too innocent to enter into that holy estate reverently , discreetly , advisedly , soberly , and in the fear of God . The modern generation was neither reverent , discreet , advised , nor sober . They were in fear of nothing . Certainly not of God . Certainly not of their parents . Robin and Stephen , standing side by side in that khaki-clad group of striplings , a little bald , a little grey , a little stooped , a little paunchy in their formal black broadcloth cutaways , waiting to give , reluctantly , these women to be married to these men , were the only reverent , discreet , advised , and sober individuals before that improvised altar . They were in fear of God . They were in fear of everything  --  for theirP413children . But fear was foolish . Fear was , perhaps , hysterical . They were all good children . Isabel 's sobs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Cicily , take thee , John Ward , for my wedded hus-band ' John Ward . Her father 's namesake . Isabel 's first baby was marrying her own . Isabel 's baby  --  only yesterday an armful of afghans  --  now a soldier in khaki , suitable cannon fodder , was marrying Cicily with her head like a dandelion . Marrying Cicily not twenty feet away from the site of the old sandpile where they had built their sand castles I , Albert , take thee , Isabel , for my wedded wife ' Albert Lancaster  --  the second Albert Lancaster  --  Muriel'sbeautiful little boy who had grown up to look like a youthful Bacchus and to act like one , too , sometimes  --  Cicily 's laughing story of his behavior at the bachelors ' dinner at the University Club the night before had been really outrageous  --  Albert Lancaster , who was his father 's son  --  but only nineteen and heart-breakingly innocent in spite of the vine leaves  --  was marrying Belle  --  little Belle , with a face like an apple blossom . When had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Four years ago , at the foot of the stairs in the Lakewoodhall , with Jimmy framed in the portieres of the livingroomdoor . Jimmy , watching her kiss little Belle . Jimmy , whose mocking , informal ghost had curiously no place at this ceremony in the Lakewood garden . It paled before Stephen 's substantial presence . Stephen , who adored Cicily and had made the sandpile and had shared so consolingly in the worry and hurry and foreboding of the last hectic weeks . Weeks in which the sustaining sense of Jimmy 's cheerful companionshiphad faded ever so imperceptibly , but irrevocably , out of the foreground of Jane 's reveries . Lost in the bustle of prepa- ration , the preoccupation of misgiving , Jane , for the first time since Jimmy 's death in France , had had no time for Jimmy . If I had gone away with him , ' she reflected , if I had marriedhim , I suppose we should both be here to-day , watching Stephen give away Cicily . I should be feeling about Stephen just as I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to feel about Stephen , standing helplessly by Cicily 's side before that improvised altar  --  and feeling about Jimmy the way I did then ' A faint shiver of repulsion passed over Jane . She felt herselfsuddenly submerged in an ignoble sense of relief at the realization of domestic decencies forever maintained , of vulgarcomplexities forever avoided . Were worlds well lost for love ? Jane did not know . Jane 's love for Jimmy had presented in her life an absolutely insoluble problem . His death had placed a question mark beyond it . If he had lived , perhaps she might have arrived at a solution . She only knew , now , that she had acted in response to an inner instinct so strong that love itself had stood vanquished before it . The instinct was victorious , but the victory was barren . She had tried to preserve the happiness of others . In reward she had been left only with a feeble , futile feeling that , in any event , her own happiness could never have been attained . A barren victory . A victory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to think of Jimmy standing at her elbow , bound by the ties of wedlock at Cicily 's marriage . He was a phantom lover . He had to be . No other kind was possible for a Lakewood housewife  --  for Mrs. Stephen Carver But should one sacrifice love to nothing morethan a sense of decorum ? The orchestra swelled joyously into the Mendelssohn weddingmarch . Jane had not heard the clergyman 's last solemn adjuration . The bridal couples turned from the altar . Thep4I5groomsmen and ushers drew their swords . Bright , virgin blades , flashing in the June sunshine . They made an arch of steel . Soon those swords would be spitting Germans . To-day they formed a nuptial canopy . Swords should be beaten into ploughshares . They should not spit Germans . Neither should they make an arch , a churchly , Gothic arch , a glamorous , romantic arch , under which young warriors  --  too young warriors  --  led their brides from glamour to reality . Cicily , radiant on Jack 's arm , threw her a sunshine smile . Belle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jenny pranced down the grassy aisle to the rhythm of the Mendelssohn . Her nervousness was all gone . She was young and absurdand adorable . The ushers gallantly sheathed their swords and fell in to follow . Jane felt Stephen 's hand upon her arm . She knew that she was looking at him stupidly . There were tears in his eyes . Robin was blowing his nose . Isabel was frankly weeping . Muriel , beyond the satin ribbons , was powdering her tear-stained cheeks . It was over . Jane realized that she had experienced no emotion whatever during the brief ceremony . It had been routed by thought . Confused , perplexing thought . Emotion would come , Jane knew , if she looked into Stephen 's eyes . She would not look into them . She would take his arm and hold her head high and walk down that grassy aisle in the sight of that company  --  and God , if He were really there  --  as if she had approved of these weddings . Stephen read her heart . No one else should read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , anxious glance  --  and God , whose glance she could not catch . The Mendelssohn had ceased . The congregation were nodding and whispering and smiling . The orchestra was playing Over There . ' Jane slipped her fingers through the crook of Stephen 's elbow . The ushers , already **30;323;TOOLONG to one of the members of the Ladies ' Guild that he would not have any " lay pope " in his church  --  and if that were verified , Mrs. Jane would go back forthwithto St. Stephen 's . " Rut you do n't care about such things , Papa ! " The lady tactfully changed the subject . Lulu Belle was clamoring to see her Grandpa , and while she did n't suppose that he would feel able to see childrenThe old gentleman interrupted . He would like nothing more than to see Lulu Belle , but he feared the effect upon the child of his sad condition . There ensued a contest in altruism , with the child as stake . Mrs. Jane declared that as soon as she got home , she would send Lulu Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too long , and weary the patient with her prattle about her dollies . To Jed it was evident that the old gentleman would rather listen to Lulu Belle prattling about her dollies than to Jane prattling about her rector and altar-cloths and candles . An hour later Lulu Belle came in . Jed , hearing the talk about " dollies , " had expected a little child , but here was a grown girl , deliberately held back , it seemed , dressed like a child , with skirts that hardly covered her knees . She was fourteen , he learned later ; her mass of golden hair , full of red and green glints when the sunlightcaught it , was tied with a pale blue ribbon at the back , and she wore a blue dress of some light stuff , and stockings and slippers to match . " Blue Belle , " her grandfather greeted her , and you could see she was his pet .   " Oh , Grandpa , I 'm so sorry ! " She stood in the doorway , staring at his stricken face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him and fell on her knees by the bed , and caught his hand and wet it with tears . " Grandpa , are n't you going to be able to go out in the garden with me ? " " Do n't cry , dear , " said the old gentleman . " The doctor says I 'm to have a nice wheel-chair , and I 'm havinga sloping walk made into the garden , and Mr. Rusher will wheel me out into the sunshine . This is Mr. Rusher , who takes care of me , and does everything I ask him to . " " How do you do , Mr. Rusher ? " said Lulu Belle , turningher sunshine upon Jed . " It 's kind of you , and please do your best , because he 's such a nice Grandpa , and I cried most of the night when I heard he was sick and they would n't let me come to see him . Please tell me if I say anything I should n't , because they said I could only come if I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got some Dutch tulip bulbs , and I 've brought some for you . Ours are up already , and you never saw anything so pretty . " Jed realized in course of time , there was one member of this large family who really did love old Mr. Warrener . It was not that Lulu Belle was too young to be worldly  --  there were other children even younger who were thoroughly sophisticated , talking money just as glibly as their elders , and fully posted as to who was who , and why . But Lulu Belle had escaped the contagion . Perhaps it was the sheltered life she lived ; having never been to school , except a dancing-school , and then always in the company of her governess , a prim maiden lady , devout according to the St. Michael 's formula . Lulu Belle was an only child , and played in a big garden with her " dollies . " How should she know what money meant , when she never handled it , but merely asked for anything she wanted , and saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Liza , because they were so different , they summed up the contrast of the classes . He remembered Liza at fourteen  --  just when he was beginning to notice things . Liza had had a household on her shoulders , the same lean , grim , hard driven , hard-driving soul that she was now with twice the years ' burden . She had run a household of five , cooking three meals a ( lay and cleaning up , wrestling with the demon rum , providing moral training for a younger sister and two brothers , routing them sleepyeyedout of bed and driving them to their chores , or getting them dressed in their patched clothes and marchingthem off to church : all that , plus accidents and emergencies , poverty , sickness , death . And here was this darling of Privilege , blooming into womanhood , but kept as a plaything and live doll by her mother , a society matron reluctant to grow old , and to have the calamity advertised by a grown daughter . Lulu Belle had apparently been held back in mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ childish that Jed wondered if she was " all there . " Anyhow , she was nice to look at ; with that peaches and cream complexionwhich fades so quickly , and can not be imitated by any art of the " cosmetician . " She was sunshine in a sick room , bubbling happiness like a fountain . Not even the gray face of her stricken old grandfather could keep her sad , because he was going to be taken into the garden by this nice Mr. Rusher , and be shown wherep103the Dutch bulbs had been planted , and they would watch for the first green shoots . It did not fill Jed with class-consciousness to compare Lulu Belle with Liza , for the reason that he never thought of himself as really belonging among the soilslaves . He was going to climb , and this was one of the things he was going to climb to . Ile watched the child with intense curiosity , devouring her with his mind . He had seen his second sister , Madge , the pretty one , turn into a woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that same stage . As a boy in school , he had recitedsome verses about a maidenStanding with reluctant feet , Where the brook and river meet , Womanhood , and childhood fleetHe had thought that very elegant , and now he understood how the poet had felt , and appreciated the value of culture . It would n't be long before they 'd have to give Lulu Belle skirts to cover at least her knees  --  so he reflected . It appeared that her mother had become aware of the situation . " Grandpa , " said the child , " do you think there 's anything wrong in my playing with dollies ? " " No , dear , why ? " " Mamma says I am getting too old , and she wants to take them away from me . But , Grandpa , I do n't know what in the world I 'll do , I 'll be so lonely ! I 've got the loveliest new dolly , that you have never seen , she 's as big as a real baby , and she makes noises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he matched with mine , and I 've got her hair tied in the back like mine , andp104I 've made her the nicest dresses  --  Aunt Lucile showed me the stitches , and I 've made an embroidered nightdress , and I hug her in my arms all night . Grandpa , I could give up all my other dollies , but do n't you think T might keep Gladys at least ? " " T do n't know , dear , you must do what Mamma says , she knows best . " " Mamma wants me to give her to some littler girl , but how would I be sure that she was kept dressed , and her hair brushed , and all ? And the lovely bedspread I made for her cradle  --  what would I do with that ? I wanted to obey Mamma , but I cried so , I just could n't help it , I could n't stop , till she said I might keep Gladys a week longer anyhow . " Jed Rusher made note  --  that even in the Garden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to climb the wall , or to fly over it on broomsticks !  |p105OLD  Mr. Walter Evarts was father to the president of the Farmer 's and Merchant 's Bank , and father-inlawto Mr. Warrener 's oldest daughter . A rich man with safe deposit boxes in several banks , he would stroll from one to another , opening the boxes and cuttingoff coupons with a pair of folding scissors which he carried in a waistcoat pocket . Also he received mail full of dividend checks , and for several hours in the morning , when the New York and Chicago exchanges opened , he would sit in the " board-room " of some broker 's office , watching a maze of figures which busy young men took from the ticker tape and wrote down with red and blue and white and yellow chalks . In the a fternoons the old gentleman would repair to the Katonah Country Club , and travel the golf-course , losingseveral balls in its artificial lake . Because he persisted in not wearing a golf-cap , his bald top was a rich brown , and with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When it was raining , and he could not travel the rnlf-cnrnrse , he would come and visit with his stricken friend , Claude Warrener . It would be Jed 's duty to set nit a little folding-table by the bedside , and get out the cribbage-set . After that , Jed would sit by the win- dow , supposed to be lost in his studies , but missing no scrap of the conversation between the games . Old Mr. Evarts knew Mountain City business , finance , politicsand fashion , and his talk was a gold-mine of anecdotes , comments , and " tips . " His attitude to the spectacle was that of an astronomer in Mars , watching the scene through a telescope . Unbelievable what these human insects would do ; but the old gentleman always believed , and would tell his stories with explosive chuckles . From these conversations Jed learned , not greatly to his surprise , that Mountain City in its politics was exactly like Zion : that is to say , there was a gang in control , engaged in making money out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gang , trying to get into office , mule charges against gang number one . There were business interests , controlled by this or that powerfulpersonality , who bought the city privileges , and put up the funds which nominated various officials in the summer and elected them in November . Jed learned the names of the powerful ones , and the corporations they controlled ; he listened to wild tales of wars past and present , with all sorts of forays and alarms . He was not surprised by the violent nature of these events , for he had been brought up in the mountain country , and understood what a grown-up mining-camp was like . Also Jed learned about the private lives of these powerful ones , and was not surprised to know that just as in Zion , they sat up nights and played poker , they drank too much , and now and then battered one another'snoses ; their wives occasionally disappeared , and were found asleep in the arms of some paramour , or indulging in a petting party in an automobile . Jedp107learned that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who made a practice of following up such indiscretions ; they bribed servants , they hired detectives , they threatened to " tip off " newspapers  --  and so they made " killings , " collecting large sums of money . Since Jed had once listened to a telephone conversationbetween the publisher of the Zion " Star " and an official of the Rocky Mountain Sugar Company , he was not surprised to learn that the biggest of collectors in Mountain City were the proprietors of its famous newspaper , the " Mail . " Gammon and Goodson was the partnership , which sat on top of the highest watchtowerin the mountain empire , with a whole battery of spy-glasses , in charge of a hundred or two trained watchers  --  a completely organized system for uncoveringthe crimes and peccadillos of everybody within a range of several hundred miles . They never had to blackmail anybody , said old Mr. Evarts , with one of his explosive chuckles ; he had discussed the problem with the business manager of the paper , who explained that all they did was to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take the money ! A dangerous thing was life in a grown-up miningcamp , where your social charm was judged by your ability to tell funny stories about how you had " bluffed " somebody and taken away his property ! Such , at any rate , was the basis of popularity of those two " good fellows , " Gammon and Goodson , proprietors of Mountain City 's biggest newspaper . Pat Gammon had begun his carer as bartender in the old Empire Hotel , ; Inc ! to the assembled banqueters of the Chamber of Commerce he narrated how he had got his start in life : " Mien I took in a silver dollar I would toss it to thep108telling , and if it stuck , it belonged to the boss , and if it came down it belonged to me . " The assembled banquetersof the Chamber of Commerce whooped with glee at this . As for Goodson  --  Thomas Jarrocks Goodson , known to his intimates as " T. J. "  --  he had begun as a high-powered real estate promoter , selling ' town-lots @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in life to tell how he had come into possession of the hundred thousand dollar palace in which he resided : a home built with infinite loving care , and occupied less than a month by its builder . This was a certain Jewish proprietor of department stores , Rosenstein by name , whose grown son developed a weakness for boys ; he had to have many , and they had to be young , and the habit was dangerous , and a source of distress to the father . The facts became known to " 7 ' . J. , " who waited patiently for the completion of the mansion which Rosenstein was building with such loving care . So eager was the builder that he moved in while the artists were still at work , putting the finishing touches to frescoes . But " T. J. " waited until everything was complete ; meanwhile his reporters hired an apartment next to the one in which the boys were being seduced , and installed a dictaphone , and bored a hole in the wall and took some photographs , which were duly prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ J. " liked to tell his cronies about it , and what had happened . " When Rosenstein 's house was ready , my story was ready too , and he moved out and I moved in ! "  |p109Mr  . Warrener believed that land speculation was a crime , but it was a crime which society saw fit to permit , and he could not abolish it by himself , therefore he would engage in it , until such a time as the public woke up . In fact , he took an obstinate kind of pleasure in reaping all the profit he could ; seeing himself in the guise of Providence , inflicting that suffering which alone would force people to think . He would put through a profitable deal , and then write a letter to a single tax paper : " See what society allows to happen ! " Also he would " play the market . " Mr. Evarts , and others of his cronies , would discuss the prices of stocks , and bring information about this one and that , and Mr. Warrener would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred shares of Rocky Mountain Sugar , or of Western Pete , or whatever it might be . He would affect to do this casually , and with indifference as to the outcome , but Jed quickly saw that this was a pose . It was a game , like the cribbage the old gentleman played , and he wanted to win , even though the stakes meant nothing to him . Jed found himself now in the position of which he had dreamed  --  he was really an " insider . " All over America people were being drawn to the stock market like moths to an arc-light ; they burned off their beautifulshining wings their money  --  and fell writhing to the ground . But who got the money ? Jed now learned  --  and this was the life-secret for which he had been groping . Persons like Mr. Evarts never gambled in stocks ; they " manipulated " them . They were in positions of power , where they could cause things top110happen . Mr. Evarts , a director in Rocky Mountain Sugar , would combine with other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day , and they would secretly sell the stock short , and reap a harvest in the crash . His cousin So-and-So was an officer in " Western fete , " and from him Mr. Evarts would get a " tip " that a " melon " was to be cut , and he would buy the stock on margin , and come in with the afternoon paper in his hand , chuckling because he had had a " good day " ; he would tell what he had " cleaned-up , " and what his wife had " cleaned-up . " So now Jed saw the pathway to success wide open before him ; only one thing kept him helpless  --  his lack of money . One chance after another passed , and he would figure what he might have gained  --  if only he had been able to buy this , or to sell that ! How pitiful seemed the check which he got every Saturday from Mr. Warrener 's secretary ! Twenty-one dollars ! How far would that get him in a broker 's office ? He talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shocked by the idea of stock-gambling ; but she was open to the argument that millions of people were doing it , and if the church members left the profits to the godless ones , how would that help the cause of the Lord ? Liza sighed because she herself had no money ; each month she had to turn over her profits to Carrie Meecham . Carrie had money and she would not be shocked . But Jed declared that he was not going into any sort of partnership with Carrie ; it was too dangerous . The last time she took him driving in her car , she had leaned towards him , and with a little more it would have turned into a regular " petting-party , " one of those things that Liza was forever denouncing.  |p111Frequently  it happened that while Jed was reading to Mr. Warrener , the old gentleman would fall asleep . Jed would step softly into the adjoining room , which served as a sort of anteroom , where servants and attendants waited , and visitors , if the patient was not ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and study until the tap of a little bell summoned him again . On one of these occasions Mr. Claude junior came in . " Governor asleep ? " he inquired , and then drew up his chair close to Jed . " I have something I want to talk to you about , Rusher . " " Yes , sir ? " said Jed , respectfully . " I am in a difficult position here , because my father ca n't come , and I do n't enjoy the Governor 's confidence as I should . You 've got a pair of ears on you , and I assume you know the intrigues that are going on here . " " Yes , Mr. Claude . " " I know that Uncle Wallace and my aunt have got away with a lot of the Governor 's money , and I have reason to think that Mrs. Evarts is trying to get him to make over this house to her . She thinks she has some claim on it , because she helped Grandmother to run it for many years , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 've heard some such proposition ? " " Yes , sir , she 's spoken of it . " " What did she say ? " Jed told him , word for word  --  from his very good memory . And Mr. Claude took a black leather wallet from his inside breast pocket and extracted therefrom a marvelous thing , the like of which Jed had never seen before , a yellow-backed bill , smooth and flat , without a wrinkle or a crease . Had he gone to the bank and got it especially to please Jed 's eager eyes ? One hundred dollars at a crack ! " Put that in your pocket , " he said . " And keep your eyes open for me , and bring me news of what the others are doing . I 'll make it worth your while right along . " " Thank you , Mr. Claude , " said Jed , and put the bill out of danger  --  but with no indecorous haste or tremblingof the fingers . " Let me add this , " said the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good word for me and my father with the Governor , do so . " " I 'm afraid I do n't know him quite well enough for that , " said Jed , modestly ; then , after a moment 's pause : " May I talk to you frankly , sir ? " " Certainly ; what is it ? " " I have n't meant to listen , Mr. Claude , but you understand I ca n't help hearing . " " Of course not . " " And it seems to me , if you 'll pardon me , you have missed some chances to say a good word for yourself . " " How do you mean ? " " Well , the old gentleman feels pretty lonely , and blue about the world in general , and he appreciates a little sympathy . He has his hobby , you know  --  " " I know  --  God help us ! " " Yes , Mr. Claude , but if you could possibly get up a little interest , and let him explain it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A sudden light dawned in the face of the young man of fashion . " Is that how you got in , Rusher ? "  | " I would n't put it that way , Mr. Claude . I told your grandfather I did n't believe in the single tax , and I doubted if I ever would ; but I know it 's an important doctrine , and they do n't teach us about it as they should in the university , and I 'm always glad to hear his ideas and discuss them with him . Ile finds that a great comfort . " " I get the idea , " said the fashionable Mr. Claude junior , with unexpected humility . " You are familiar with the situation in Europe , Mr. Claude . Is it not possible there might be some country which would be helped by a more just form of land tax ? That would n't hurt any of us in America , you know . " " By Jove , Rusher ! " exclaimed the young aristocrat , with an unaccustomed burst of enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! You 'll go a long way ! " The little bell tapped , and the two men went into the sick room . Jed helped to get his patient comfortable , and Mr. Claude spread himself in a big arm-chair , and presently was remarking : " By the way , Governor , I had a letter from the Pater ; he says they are being besieged for loans by Latvia and Lithuania and those lousy little Baltic states . The Pater ca n't see it , he says there 'll be more revolutions any day . " " What 's the matter ? " " Well , there 's a bunch of nobles have had all the land for centuries , and the peasants are practically serfs , and now they 've got the Bolsheviki stirring them up , . "  | " It is n't the Bolsheviks , Claude . I 've been trying to tell your father for the past thirty years  --  the land system of those countries is a curse . " " Well , I guess the Pater 's learned it , because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be broken up and sold to the peasants . " " But what good will that do ? My God , boy , that 's only starting the game all over again ! Those who get the land will grow rich , and turn into absentee landlords , and the price of land will go on rising , with the profits going to speculators . " " You want to handle it by a tax ? " " Of course , of course ! Put on a tax equal to the rental value , and then nobody will hold land , except what he actually farms . There is your father , right in the midst of the situation  --  but the only people who have the brains to use a scientific land tax are those Bolsheviks you are all trying to exterminate ! " " Well , f do n't know , Governor ; it might be a good idea to point out to the Pater , and let him bring it up at some of the conferences . It would be an interesting experiment . " " Especially since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that our own speculators would n't hear about it . " Exactly what Jed had said ! Mr. Warrener went on to explain the land problem as it existed in Central Europe ; he knew the land problem in every nation from China to Peru  --  not forgettingNew York and Los Angeles and points between . They had an animated discussion , which lasted until the nurse arrived to take Jed 's place . The grandson then arose , saying , " I must be getting on . " He went down in the elevator with Jed , and whenp115they were on the street , he said , " Step into my car "  --  an unimaginable piece of condescension . Jed saw that the young gentleman was proud of himself . " Well , how was it ? " " Fine ! " said Jed . " Keep it up . " To himself he was saying , " You dub , you would n't have thought of it in a hundred years if you 'd been left to yourself . " Jed was measuring himself against these great ones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sail circles around the elegant Mr. Claude junior . The child of the desolatecattle-ranch had had to find things out for himself , and it had kept him on the jump ; whereas young Claude had had everything brought to him on a silver platter , and the only efforts he had ever made had been on tennis-courts and golf-courses . " By the way , Mr. Claude , " said Jed , " do you ever play the market ? " " Now and then , " admitted the other , cautiously . " Well , of course , I hear the conversation of your grandfather 's friends , and often there are first class tips . Unfortunately , having no money , I ca n't make use of them . " " I might carry a few shares for you now and then . " " All right , sir , I 'd appreciate it . You might begin by selling Continental Steel , because Mr. Walter Evarts says that the merger that has been so much talked about is not going through , and the stock is way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walt is the taffy when it comes to the market . " Jed had never heard about " taffy , " though he knew about " cheese " and " applesauce " and " bolony " and " banana-oil , " and other odd articles of diet . He was interested to note that when it came to the subject of money to be made , Mr. Claude junior lost all his fashionable mannerisms , and became exactly the same as any other young " hustler " in the miningcampwhere he had been born . When Continental Steel had its sensational collapse a few days later , he brought Jed two more of those smooth yellow-backed bills , and told him it was his profit on the " little flyer . " Jed waved his hand easily and said , " Keep it , Mr. Claude , and sell a few shares ' of Bonanza Gold for me . Mr. Evarts says they are going to cut their dividend this quarter . " " But , Rusher ! " objected the other . " Those people are just coining money ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company officers want it for some purpose of their own , so it 's going to be kept as a surplus . " Lulu Belle came visiting again . This time she was a pink belle , from the ribbon in her hair to the slippers on her feet ; a color scheme matching her cheeks instead of her eyes . The grandfather was asleep , so she came into the anteroom on tiptoe , and seated herself on the edge of a chair , and folded her hands in her lap and fixed the big blue eyes upon the nice young attendant . " I had to promise I would n't tell Grandpa , because he must n't hear anything sad , but it wo n't do any harm for me to tell you , will it , Mr. Rusher ? " " I guess not , Lulu Belle , " he said . " What is it ? " " Mamma made me give away Gladys ! " Tears werestarting into the big blue eyes , and she gave a quickglance towards the closed door , as if to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to my Cousin Polly . She promised to take such good care of her , and keep all her dresses just as I had them , and so I know everythingwill be all right , but oh , Mr. Rusher , when I came home , it was terrible , the nursery was so empty , it was just as if she was dead . Did you ever see anythingdead , Mr. Rusher ? " " Sometimes , " Jed admitted . " I had a bird , and the cat caught her , and I got her away , but it was too late , she died , and I had to bury her ; that was very sad , but it was nothing like Gladys , because I was young then , and could n't realize it so much . Do you suppose , Mr. Rusher , a doll could have a soul ? " " I had n't thought of it , Lulu Belle . Perhaps you gave her one . " " That 's just what I said to Mamma ! But she said it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by imagining so many things about her . You see , I 've done everything for her , as if she was a real baby ; I 've played with her half the day , sometimes -- Miss Partington could n't get me to do anything else . " " You must miss her dreadfully , " said Jed . It was what was called society conversation , and he must learn to do it . But what a singular thing , that an almost woman like this , should be so infantile ! " Mamma and Miss Partington  --  that 's my governess  --  did n't know what to do for me ; but at last Mamma said if I would stop being unhappy , she would let me go to see Cousin Marian 's real baby . Did you know my Cousin Marian Barton has a new baby ? " " I had heard about it . " Jed 's mind flashed to the hoarding-house , where items of information about the Warrener clan were collected and collated . The same student who mowed the lawns for Mrs. Evarts had now got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warrener , daughter of Mr. Clive Warrener , and sister of " Claude junior . " The new baby was therefore a great-grandchild of Jed 's employer , and Carrie Meecham had cut a picture of the lovely young mother from the society pages of the " Mail . " " Oh , Mr. Rusher , it 's the sweetest little thing you ever saw in all your life ! Or maybe you 've seen a new baby ? " " Oh , yes , " said Jed , trying not to feel embarrassed . " You see , they are quite common . " " Oh , if I could have a real one like that , I wouldactually forget Gladys ! She has the tiniest little hands , and so pink and warm ; such little fingers , you would n't ' think there could be such wee things , but they have the little nails and all ; she takes hold of your finger and hangs on tight  --  I never felt anything so exciting ! And she can really see you , she follows you with her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funniest smile on her face , you know she 's hearing what you say and laughing with you . I think it 's too wonderful for such a little thing to be alive , and able to grow up , and all . " " Yes , it is indeed , " said Jed , cautiously . Lulu Belle 's big blue eyes were fixed on the young man 's dark ones , and a sober look came upon her face . " Mr. Rusher , maybe you will tell me ! " " What , Lulu Belle ? " " I want somebody to tell nie where babies come from . " The blood began to steal up above Jed 's collar , in such quantities that he feared it would attract attention.  | " Why  --  " he said , and stopped . " I think that is something you will have to ask your mother . " " Oh , but I have , and she wo n't tell me . She used to say that Santa Claus brought them ; but of course there is no sense in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , and anyway , how would he be coming in the springtime ? Then Mamma said the doctor brought them in a bag ; and when I asked her where the doctor got them , she said in a hospital ; I asked how they got to the hospital , and she would n't tell me any more . Mamma seems to think there is something wrong about babies , as there is about dollies when you have got too big ; but she wo n't tell me and she makes me hush every time I ask . " To Jed , who had been raised upon a cattle-ranch , it had seemed that no child ever grew up ignorant of the processes of generation . One of his earliest memories had to do with their family cow , upon which the children 's supply of fresh milk depended ; something had gone wrong with the calving , and the old cow had been bellowing for hours , when Zack Rusher came gallopinghome on a horse , and bared his arms , and washed them in a pail of water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and performed the bloody offices of obstetrician , while the four children stood in a row , gazing with horrifiedcuriosity . Also , Jed had overheard Liza tell the story to some woman  --  how when he himself had come into the world , it had been prematurely , and with no one to help but Liza , then six years of age ; she had had to witness her mother 's agony , and take the new-born infant , choking and gurgling , into her trembling arms , while the mother tied up its navel cord . Perhaps that was the reason for the passionate care she had always given to Jed , and the way she drove him and followed him step by step along the pathway of success . The little bell rang just then . " There 's Grandpa ! " said Lulu Belle : and Jed went in , and reported her presence . It was a sunny afternoon in May , and Mr. Warrener told the child to go down into the garden , and he would join her . There followed an elaborate procedure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gardener 's assistants , a young husky also just off a ranch . The assistant was summoned , and the readingtablewas moved out of the way , and the wheel-chair put alongside the bed . There was a board , polished smooth , which was worked under the two hundred pound frame of the old gentleman , and on this he was half slid and half lifted over to the wheel-chair , and into the seat . He could help with his arms to keep himself steady , but his poor legs were helpless , and had to be put into place and covered with a shawl . After that he was wheeled to the elevator , and down an inclined way which had been constructed from a veranda to the garden . So there was Lulu Belle and her Grandpa , traveling the winding paths side by side . Animal life was forgotten , and the vegetable kingdom became the center of attention : all the bright green things which had worked their heads up through the ground , and were now spreading their glory to the sunshine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vegetable kingdom , it appeared , and Miss Partington had told her charge all about stamens and pistils and pollen andp121bees and seeds . Lulu Belle knew all the flowers and shrubs , and their various stages of growth , and she , gave the nice Mr. Rusher lessons in botany , and showed her Grandpa where the butch tulip bulbs had been planted , and they scanned the smoothly raked brown soil , but found no trace of a sprout . " where was a big green-house in one corner of the grounds , and in the moist heat under its glass they inspected banana-plants in blossom , and Valencia orange-trees with golden fruit , and scarlet hibiscus , and orchids , and other strange plants of which the nice Mr. Rusher had never heard so much as the names . Jed was up in the world now ! This was the thing he had dreamed of ; this was luxury , this was power . Not to grow sugar beets , to be sold to a cold-hearted company for less than the cost of production ; but to grow huge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to be carried by some queen of society in a ballroom ! Not to crawl around in the dirt , and wear callouses on your hands and knees ; but to stroll in lordly state  --  or even to be pushed in a wheel-chair  --  and have respectful gardeners tip their caps to you , and be happy when you showed appreciation of their handiwork ! Yes , that was the way Jed was going to live some day  --  and not so far off either ! He suddenly decided that he was going to have a green-house , with bananas and oranges and hibiscus and orchids in it ; also , he was ding to have some golden-haired daughter of luxury , some Blue Belle or Pink Belle , to give him lessons in hit ally , and show him where the Dutch bulbs had been planted ! Come to think of it  --  Jed 's swift imaginationrot leaping  --  why not this particular Belle ? She was lovely enough to satisfy his vaulting ambitions ; and what was more to the point , she was at hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he have to do to win such a prize ? He knew the answer without a moment 's hesitation  --  he would have to make a large sum of money ! Without that , his suit would be an impertinence , almost a crime . Also , he would have to do it quickly , for Lulu Belle was not going to wait , the processes of nature were inexorable.  |p123JED  was continuing his college work in the mornings . One course , which was given in the afternoon , he had had to drop , but he would make it up at the summer session . If only the fates which controlled his destinies would keep old Mr. Warrener alive , so that Jed could have this wonderful job all through the summer , instead of having to wander over the state trying to sell portfoliosor subscription books or milking-machines or patent razor-strops to the wives of bankrupted farmers ! The news of his good fortune was known to most of the campus , and had made him a person of consideration . Many realized the importance of being near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity as fallen to the lot of this tall young ranch-hand . His manner of reserve became suddenly effective ; people could speculate about him , and imagine things more interesting than the reality . Chancellor Saybuck stopped him on the campus . " What 's this I hear , Rusher , about your being employed by Mr. Warrener ? " " Yes , sir , he sent for me to take care of him , and of course I could n't refuse . " " What do you do ? "  | " I am with him three hours every afternoon . I do whatever he needs . Mostly I read to him . " " What do you read ? " " Newspapers , magazines , anything he gives me . " " Do you read things about radicalism and infidelism ? " " Yes , sir , I am sorry to say I do ; but I do n't let it affect me ; it goes in one ear and out of the other . " " Be careful , my boy ; I shall pray for your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my charges should fall into the snares of the tempter . Remember , Satan is wily , and knows how to bait his traps with cunning . " " Yes , sir , I think I know what you mean ; but I 'll not be caught . " Jed answered with assurance ; but in truth , he did not feel it in his heart . Things were happening inside him which he slid not want to acknowledge ; he pushed them away , and shut his eyes . For an hour or two almost every day his mind was being bombarded by suggestions of a sort which he had never heard of before . It was n't so much any particular argument , as it was a point of view : the idea that one should judge the facts of life on the basis of plausibility and common sense , instead of accepting a set of doctrines which your parents and teachers and pastors told you were sacred . In vain Jed told himself that he was n't interested in such matters , that he only wanted to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ idea was being insinuatedinto his mind day by day . Here was his employer , asking some shrewd question , or dropping some casual remark , calculated to make him ashamed of believingsilly and childish things , of being afraid to use his brains upon the problems of life . And here on thep125other side was Liza , watching him , dreading lest , for the sake of worldly fortune , she might be allowing her precious younger brother 's soul to be imperiled by contact with a wicked , scoffing atheist . Watch your step , Jed Rusher ! Mr. Claude junior 's " little flyer " in Bonanza Gold turned out favorably , and so did another , based upon the report that a pool had been formed to boost Pacific Oil . Jed was beginning to accumulate a little capital , and pretty soon he would be able to do his own investing . He told no one but Liza about it , but put the money away in the postal savings-bank , an inconspicuous place . The only change he allowed himself was a fashionablytailored suit of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that is to say , a hat and tie and shoes and socks to match , and gloves for special state occasions . He was staking his future upon the conviction that the way to grow rich was to associate with the rich , and one of the first steps was to be dressed like them , and not like the forlorn creatures who wandered up and down in front of their mansions and peered through the gates . Also , Jed became even more reserved in his manner . It became a source of annoyance to him that people were trying to fasten on to him , and to get information out of him . If they wanted to know about great people , let them go find out for themselves . The idea of the hoarders imagining they could get Jed to help them sell life insurance , or automobiles , or electric refrigerators to his wealthy friends ! Or Carrie Meecham , actually Imposing to exchange her Miss Hugins for Mrs.p126Claudius G. Warrener ! Carrie had the idea that Mrs. Warrener might transact some business in Carrie 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was hinting that if Jed would arrange this , she would get her Miss Hugins to invite Liza and Jed to dinner some time . Carrie 's old lady was getting older , and might need a man to help take care of her . As if Jed Rusher were going to spend the rest of his life dancing attendanceupon querulous old invalids ! Also at the university were fellows who were hoping to get a share of Jed 's Christmas cake : summer jobs in the Warrener garden , or chauffeuring somebody , or tutoring some child . Several of the astute ones , hearingthat Jed was meeting great financiers like " Old Walt "  --  so Mr. Evarts was known in all the " boardrooms "  --  beganfishing for " tips , " and had to be quietly but firmly put in their places . All but one of them , Dick Sunstorm . Dick was a man of real ability , Jed knew . He could sell things , and sooner or later , Jed was going to have something to sell  --  something on a big scale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who could handle one housewife , would know how to handle a million , and Jed would make use of his talents : not a partnership , or anything that would tie Jed up , but a salary and a bonus , that would keep Dick hustling . Jed swore him to secrecy , and let him into the pool which was to boost Pacific Oil . Dick had n't very much money saved up , but he took a chance and borrowed some , and carried half the stock for Jed , according to agreement , and both of them came out flourishing . Thereafter , Dick played the part of a hungry pike swimming about in Jed 's pond . He did not go off that summer to sell subscription books , butp127got a local job , and waited for another tip . He proved his ability by not making himself a nuisance , but just being on hand . Day by day Jed was meeting new members of the Warrener family , and increasing his familiarity with the manners , language , costumes , opinions , and " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Charlie " Eddystone with his wife , who was the second of the daughters of old Mr. Warrener , and known to the household as " Mrs. Lou . " " Charlie " was a man of fashion , polo-player , turfman and general sport , rosy , brown and hearty , with a tendency to " embonpoint " which he tried to keep down by every kind of violent effort , save the moral one of eating less . Mrs. Lou was a wife made to order for him ; jolly , noisy , a bit vulgar , Jed feared , though he was not sure that he was sufficiently informed about the great world to pass such a judgment . In the winter-time Mrs. Lou would appear in a leopard-skin coat , yellow with vivid black spots ; now , in the springtime , she wore Chinese " mandarins , " scarlet with golden dragons , or sky-blue with peacocks of green and purple . Her voice was voluminousand penetrating , more suited to the polo-field than to the sick room ; when she was amused , she would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear lu  --  r all over the house . Jed liked her , because she said what she thought , and this was helpful to one seeking information . She would tell the truth about the family ; she would tell the truth about everybody else in Mountain City " society "  --  though she spent most of her time traveling about withp128her husband to racing-meets and polo-matches and yachting and other contests all the way from Bar Harbor , Maine , to Coronado , California . " Pa , " she said , " I have only one life to live , and I 'm going to live that to suit me , and the old cats are n't going to get their claws into my heart . I 've just come from a bridgepartywhere there were twenty-eight of them  --  my God , such a clatter  --  tearing each other 's reputations to shreds , and wishing they could tear each other 's hair . Every day I swear a new vow , that I 'll associate only with men ; I keep it  --  till one of these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love to me ! " An amazing thing happened . Mr. Warrener reached to the table by his bedside , where stood his cigars and his matches ; he took the box of cigars , and quite casually , in the midst of conversation , held it out to his daughter ; she , quite casually , in the midst of conversation , took one , and took the match-stand and proceeded to light the cigar , and puff at it , and then examineit , to see what kind it was . She went on puffing , and discussing family affairs , and Jed hid his consternationbehind his book . He had grown familiar with the fact that these society ladies all smoked " cigareetes , " as the angry Liza termed them ; he had seen old ladies on cattle-ranches smoking corn-cob pipes ; but a long brown rakish " stogie "  --  and in the presence of her father ! " Pa , I have just this much to say , I know they 're all scrambling for the money , they want Mother 's jewels , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I want to say , go ahead and give whatever you please , Charlie and I are managing to keep going , and we sure do n't want to embitter yourp129last years . I 'm afraid you 're not getting much happinessout of your children , but you know how it is , I have to go with Charlie , to fight the vamps away from him  --  God knows what they see in this large hunk of beef that has to be massaged every day , but there seems to be something incendiary about his smile , and I have to stay on the job to shout them down  --  that 's a trick I have learned , I talk to them straight , right out loud so that the whole golf-course hears , and they turn tail and run . " The head of Mrs. Lou went back , and her mouth opened , and forth came a peal of laughter that the whole golf-course might have heard if it had not been several miles away . And there sat Charlie , grinning amiably , not seeming to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ large hunk of beef . " An old tradition of the West , that you may call people certain bad names , provided you smile while you say it ! When Mrs. Lou at last blew out of the room , her " Pa " sighed a little wearily , and looked at Jed Rusher and smiled . It was the one occasion when Jed ever heard him criticize his children ; the reason no doubt being that Mrs. Lou herself invited it , and that her faults were of the surface kind , which nobody could fail to note . The old gentleman said : " I have n't had much effect on life , have I , Rusher ? " " It 's hard to make it go as one wants , " said the younger man , philosophically . " I realize now what I should have done  --  now that It 's too late . I ought to have refused to give any one of them a cent , and made them work their own way as you are doing . "  | " It really does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I knew that ; but the job was too much for me. to the outside world , a man can have his way , he can run his business , and even advocate his ideas ; but in the home , there are the women , and they have too many ways of making you miserable  --  it 's a pressure not to be withstood . My son had to go to Yale , because his smart friends were there , and he had to have money to go the pace with them . My daughters had to attend the most expensive finishing-school that any female fraud could devise to impress the daughters of mining-kings and cattle-barons . Now they are all finished , ' and I ca n't have the least effect upon them . " The poor old millionaire sighed once more , and took up the last issue of his single tax paper , and began marking clippings for Jed to file away in the cabinet , where neither he nor any one else would ever see them again . Mrs. Marian Warrener Barton brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family . She came in royal state , the precious infant carried on a lace pillowby a French bonne dressed in white , with a cap having long blue streamers trailing down her back . Jed had never seen such a thing before , and he knew right away that it was the real thing ; one glance , and the whole world knew that the mite of human life on that pillow was destined to grow up and rule an empire of steel or coal or oil or sugar-beets or cattle . Lydia Abercrombie Warrener Barton was the mite 's name , and she was the fourth of the great-grandchildren ; the " Claude juniors " had one son , and there was an older granddaughter who had a son and a daughter . The young mother was , of course , extremely proud of what she had done . Still a little pale from the ordeal , she sat down quickly in the easiest of the chairs ; it was her first time out , she explained , and she had come directly to show Grandpa . The pillow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capable arms , and he surveyed the mite , and made the proper gurgling noises which are supposed to entertain human mites , and smiled his best imitation of the mite 's smile , and said she looked like her mother , but still more like her grandmother , not so much like her great-grandmother . They discussed brown eyes versus blue eyes and bluegrayeyes in the Warrener biology ; brown hair versus golden , and the changes which take place in the color of baby 's hair . Life was weaving its spells about poor old Mr. Warrener ; setting another trap for his paralyzed feet , baitingit with love and hope ! How could any one gaze into this innocent tiny face , with its smile freshly importedfrom heaven , its soft , tender flesh , its tiny gropingfingers  --  and imagine that it was to grow up into a worldly-minded woman , who would set herself to destroythe idealism in some man 's soul ; bearing him children , and insisting that the boys go to a college of snobbery , and the daughters to the most expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mining-kings and cattle-barons ? No , surely his great-grandchildren were going to be more  --  wise and more happy , thought the poor old rich than with his limbs already in the grave ! Jed was watching the young mother , and again thinking about Liza , who was so different . When these ladies of the great world grew up , their hardness was apt to show in their faces  --  scars of the battle for love , for money , for flattery , prestige , attention , whatever they fed upon . But when they were twenty , or twentytwo , like Mrs. Marian , they were certainly lovely to look upon : skins without a wrinkle , voices soft , mannersgracious , always smiling , serene and safe . Somebodyhad taught them exactly how to fix their hair , exactly how to dress , what colors to set off their complexions , what cut and style to bring out the good points of their figures ; they knew how to enter a room , how to receive an introduction , how to meet every situation . Life had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yes , even when they had a baby ! It did not come prematurely , because there were expert surgeons to watch over them , and nurses in attendance , knowing exactly what to do , so that two or three weeks later the lovely young mother would emerge , a trifle pale , but still smiling , still self-possessed , and knowing that Grandpa , duly reminded by a visit , would add a magical clause to his will , securing to the tiny Lydia Abercrombie Warrener Barton the share of that security and power which was due to her , and to her children and grandchildren and great-grandchildren to the end of capitalist time . Lulu Belle came in . She had heard of the proposed visit , and it was another chance for her to see the new baby . She ran and kissed her Cousin Marian , shep133kissed her Grandpa on his withered cheek , and then she flew to the tiny mite of life on the pillow . Oh , the cutest thing , the most wonderful thing ! If only they had such a new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , could n't you lend her to us some time ? Oh , Cousin Marian , she would look so sweet in the cradle I had for Gladys ! " Lulu Belle was completely infatuated with this new living dollie , that could do so many things that not even the most expensive dollies in the department-stores could achieve ! She would be content if she could just stand and gaze at the miracle ; if they would let her lift up the long dress and watch the tiny red toes wriggling and twisting , she would cry out , and insist that somebodycome and look  --  even the nice Mr. Rusher , if everybody else was too busy talking . Lulu Belle had been studying French , it appeared , and chattered away with the French bonne , which was a very impressive thing to Jed . He had laboriously studied French in the class-room , but had never realized that anybody might be able to talk it right off fast like that . When the new baby took her departure , Lulu Belle remained to play a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but made errors on purpose , if Jed 's suspicions were correct . Anyhow , they had a good time ; and when the day-nurse arrived , releasing Jed , it happened that the chauffeur and car arrived for Lulu Belle . So Jed had the pleasure of walking the length of the corridor with the ( laughter of Privilege , and taking her down in the automatic elevator , and escorting her through the front door . Not much opportunity , as measured by the second hand of a watch ;  | but enough for the most amazing experience in a country boy 's life up to date . Lulu Belle opened up the moment they were out of the sick room . " Oh , Mr. Rusher , Mamma told me about where babies come from ! " " Did she ? " Jed managed by an extreme effort to keep his voice normal . " Yes , she says they come out of their mother 's bodies . Did you ever hear anything so strange ? At first I thought it was just another story she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that she once carried me under her heart , and when I was born I came out of her , all alive , like baby Lydia ! " Jed Rusher , you wanted to move in high society , and learn to do fashionable conversation  --  and here is some of it ! This is the way the daughters of Privilege entertaintheir young men acquaintances , while strolling through the corridors of their grandfather 's home ! And without the slightest sense of embarrassment  --  actually without dropping their voices , lest the grandmother , or Aunt Lucile , or the secretary , or the housekeeper , or the chambermaid , or the butler , might over . hear ! " Did you know about that , Mr. Rusher ? " persisted the child . " Yes , I knew about it , " said Jed . His neck was on fire , and the flames were spreading to his ears , to his cheeks . A swift glance showed that he and Lulu Belle were alone ; but some of the room doors were open , and if this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his job . " And you would n't tell me ! " said she , reproachfully . " Mamma seemed to think she ought to be ashamed of it ,  |p135but  I thought it was lovely , it made me love her more . She says it hurt terribly when I came out . But she would n't tell me any more about it . " They entered the automatic elevator , and Jed closed the two doors and pressed the button . At least he was safe for the space of a minute or so ; the hum of the machinery would keep the child 's voice from carrying . But Lulu Belle was not thinking about that , she had apparently no sense of anything unusual . " She would n't tell me how you come to have a baby . How is it , Mr. Rusher ? Does it just happen , or is it something you have to do ? " Silence ! The flames had reached Jed 's forehead now . " Oh , you wo n't tell me either ! Please do ! Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can you have a baby when you are young like me ? " The elevator came to a stop at the main floor ; and it was Jed 's duty as a gentleman in good society to open the two doors , and permit the child to precede him out of the elevator . But his knees were weak and his hands trembling . Suppose there should be some one outside there  --  any one , a member of the family or a servant , who would catch one phrase of such a conversation ! Surely , before Jed touched the latch of the door , he should turn upon this child and whisper : " Hush , Lulu Belle ! You are an unnatural and perverted creature , wholly lacking in that modesty and reticence which is innate in every pure and good woman ! " At least he should say : " Do n't let anybody hear you ! They wo n't approve your asking such questions of a young man ! " But Ted 's mind was in a whirl , and for once his thoughts were too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then the outer one , and Lulu Belle stepped forth , and turned to wait , while he closed the two doors again . She did not even look to see if any one was near . But Jed did , in a panic , even while he was fumbling with the doors . There was no one in sight , thank God ! But there were entrances to other rooms , with double doors open ; also there were chairs in the shadows , where some one might be sitting . Think quickly , Jed , and take care of yourself ! " I think if you will ask your mother properly , Lulu Belle , she will explain to you all that you really need to know . " " But she wo n't , Mr. Rusher ! " They were walking across the spacious entrance hall , side by side , to the front door . " But I 've made up my mind to find out , and do you know why ? I 'm going to have a baby of my own . " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tell how , I 'll find somebody else that will . I thought I 'd ask you because you were going to college , and you know about everything . Oh , please , Mr. Rusher , tell me how ! Just think how happy I 'd be , if I could have a baby all my own , as lovely as Lydia , to put her in the cradle where Gladys used to be , and to wash her and dress her and take care of her all the time . I would n't be too old to keep her , because it 's only dollies that one gets too o1 ( 1 for . You see , there is Cousin Marian , she is grown up , but it 's all right for her to have a real baby , everybody agrees ! " They had got to the front door , and Jed opened it . His bewildered mind achieved this much thought : " My cheeks are burning , my whole face is red , and the chauffeur will see it , and the governess may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approve of my walking out to the car with her , I 'm not supposed to know her at all . " He halted in the doorway . " I forgot something I have to attend to for your Grandpa , Lulu Belle . I have to go back . " The big blue eyes were fixed upon his face , a gaze without a trace of embarrassment . " Please tell me , Mr. Rusher ! Or tell me why not ! " " I ca n't do it , Lulu Belle , I ca n't do it ! Good-by "  --  and the bewildered youth from the cattle-country turned into the house , closing the great door behind him . P138TAKE a long walk , Jed Rusher , and try to get that fever out of your blood ! Let dinner at the boardinghousewait , while you tramp the streets , and think all the thoughts which failed you during those incredible three or four minutes ! In the first place , could it be possible that a girl was so completely ignorant upon the subject of reproduction , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begetting and pregnancy ? A hard thing for any son of the cattle-country to believe ! Jed thought of a hundredsights he had seen , the behavior of a score of different animals ; cattle , horses , dogs , chickens , wild birds , all had answered the questions of a country child . He had to remind himself that most of these sights had never been seen by Lulu Belle ; also perhaps she had not been alone with other children enough to hear their jokes and allusions . It really did seem to be true ; her ignorance was genuine . It was an axiom of Jed 's thinking that every good woman was endowed with a native and instinctive modesty , which told her what was wrong for her to do , to talk about , even to think about . In fact , that was the difference between a good woman and a bad one . The bad ones talked openly about such matters , P139and indulged themselves as did the animals ; whereas the good woman averted her eyes , and fled from the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God in His goodness had made her that way . Liza was ' a good woman  --  none better  --  and it had been Liza who determined Jed 's thinking about such matters . Of the breeding of the animals you took cognizance , because it was the way God had appointed for them to increase and multiply ; " male and female created He them . " The farmer 's life depended upon this multiplying , and so it was a matter of necessity . But when it came to human beings , you talked about the subject as little as possible , and always with a sense of embarrassment , of " Hush ! " in the air . That atmospherewas the proof of your goodness , your rightnessof instinct and training . According to this view , Lulu Belle was not good at all ; as far from it as possible . Yet , could Jed really believe that she was bad ? Was there something here that he did not understand ? Liza was forever warning him about the corruptness of the idle rich . She apparentlyknew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid of ? Did she know that girls who were reared in rich households , with governessesand many servants , had a habit of craving illegitimate babies ? That did n't fit exactly with another of Liza 's charges , that such women refused to have any babies at all , but practiced a wicked thing called birth control , and went about with Persian cats and Pekinese dogs in their arms ! I t was all very confusing , and Jed tried to think it out for himself ; in that long ramble about the streets and parks of Mountain City , the depths of his being were plowed up , and he came as near to facing the realities of his creed as ever in his life . Was it true that wealth was corrupting ? Did he really believe that , or did Liza ? If so , why did he want to get rich , and why was Liza helping him ? No , she believed that it was possible to be both rich and good ; there was the example of Mr. Crumback , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belong to the right church , and have a doctrine which kept you safe against the wiles of Satan . But people who attended fashionableand worldly churches , like the Episcopalian , or idolatrous churches like the Catholic  --  these were in peril whether rich or poor . A man like Mr. Warrener , who rejected the Word of God entirely , would naturally live to see his children turn against him , and wander into evil paths . Did not the Good Book say that the sins of the fathers would be visited upon the children , even unto the third and fourth generations ? Lulu Bell was the third generation , and she was paying for her grandfather 's sins ! The fact that she was personally innocent and blameless would not save her  --  that was clear , according to the Bible text . But did Jed really believe it ? Or had he come , half withoutrealizing it , to adopt Mr. Warrener 's idea that you must n't accept a thing because it was in the Bible but must decide for yourself if it was reasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take to passing judgments upon Him , telling Him what He should and should not do ? This was no abstract theological question , but a very practical one , of immediate urgency . For it meant , was Jed going to take the fate of Lulu Belle into his own hands , regardless of God 's wishes ? Jed pursued thep141argument one step further , and asked : Suppose it was God 's wish that he interfere ? Suppose he , Jed Rusher , were chosen to be God 's instrument in saving this child ? It was a viewpoint much more agreeable to a person of active and dominating temperament . That is the way the great deeds of history have been done  --  by some man 's making up his mind that he is acting as an agent of Omniscience . Assuming that Jed meant to do something , what was he to do ? Should he go to his employer and say : " Mr. Warrener , I am embarrassed to have to tell you this , but I feel it to be my duty ; your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and such a proposition , and I think her mother should be told about it , so that she may discipline and teach the child . " Jed was sure that Mr. Warrener would thank him for this , and considerthat he had acted as an honorable man . But how would Mrs. Macy take it ? She would be horrified , and beside herself with humiliation , and she might lock Lulu Belle up in her room and put her on a bread and water diet . But what would be her attitude to the informer ? Jed was lacking in experience of life , but some instinct whispered to him that the bearer of evil tidings is seldom welcomed . Jed would remain as a thorn in the thoughts of a proud woman , reminding her of an experience she was anxious to forget . She might take it into her head to remove him from her sight ; and had not Jed 's employer admitted his weakness where he clashed with the women of his family ?  | Or should Jed talk to Lulu Belle , and admonish her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make a friend or an enemy . It was necessary to decide upon the guiding motive of his discourse  --  would he be talking to her for her good , or for his own ? A question that took Jed into deep water again ; he had to deal with the basic principles of life as he meant to live it . He had got fixed in his mind the intention to marry Lulu Belle ; but now , if she was a " bad woman , " surely he did not want to marry her ! Or did he ? Would he marry a " bad woman " who happened to be an heiress ? And just how bad did he really consider Lulu Belle ? Not so bad but that she might be reformed by a good man ? And assuming that he was going to reform her , would he do it before marriage , or after ? Jed wrestled with these problems for more than twenty-four hours before their dark and sinister aspects flashed upon his mind . On the second evening he was taking another aimless ramble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was shining when he started , but before he got home dark storm-clouds had come rolling up the sky , and in the mountains which line the western horizon of the city there were flashes of lightning and long rumbles of thunder . To the accompaniment of this devil 's music Jed Rusher made his first visit to hell ; that is , he tumbled into those depths of the human soul which have made necessary the conception of infernalregions , and of agencies seeking the destruction of frail mortals . The idea smote his mind in the manner of one of those bolts of lightning smiting the pine trees in the mountains . He had wanted to marry Lulu Belle ; he had thought of it as something far-off and difficult , toP143be achieved after the slaying of many dragons , unicorns and giants . " I 'll have to get at least a million , " had been his thought , and he had not been able to foresee exactly how he could accomplish that in four or five years . But here was a way that would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lulu Belle wanted a baby , wanted it at once ; and suppose that he , Jed Rusher , were to give it to her  --  would he then have any difficulty in marrying her ? On the contrary , would not the family come after him , determined to make him marry her , with a shotgun if necessary ? So it had been in the world which Jed Rusher knew , and he was so naive as to think it would be the same among the rich . From the moment of that first lightning-blast in his soul , Jed knew that it was a wicked thought . The crash of it appalled him , the emotional echoes of it set his heart to pounding . But it was a thought he could not get away from , it would give him no peace : the great temptation of his life , the recurrence of that ancientstory which he had read about : " The devil taketh him up into an exceeding high mountain , and showeth him all the kingdoms of the world , and the glory of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ child of Wallace J. Macy , he would have the equivalent of a kingdom , and he set upon the road to conquer others  --  no doubt of that ! The Macys and Warreners might be furious at the outset , calling him a seducer and a scoundrel ; but they would get over it , for he would he a member of the elan , ranking with all other members in the matter of publicity , and disgrace to him would be disgrace to all . In their public attitude , the family would try to make the world believe that the marriage was one they had chosen , because of the fine character of this self-supportingyoung college man , winner of the Crumback scholarship ! Jed could see the story , as Miss Newcomb , the social secretary , would prepare it and hand it to the papers . IIIA storm-wind shaking the trees along the street , and a storm of desires shaking Jed 's soul . He had pictured his life as a toilsome climb , in which he might exhaust himself before he got to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fly with ! It seemed almost too easy to be possible ; if men could get to the summit of success in that way , why did n't it happen often ? Or maybe it did  --  how was Jed to know ? Maybe there were many great families which had adopted some unwantedson-in-law , and successfully hushed up the scandal ! Jed began to recall stories in the papers , of heiresses who had run away with grooms and ridingmasters , chauffeurs and musicians , actors , poets , and what-not  --  yes , it had happened , and might happen again ! His thoughts swung from one extreme to the other . It could not really be possible that a lovely child like Lulu Belle would do such a shocking thing as he was picturing ! She was asking questions , in her ignorance and innocence ; but surely , when the questions were answered  --  thenwould come a shock and a reaction ! Then surely instinctive modesty would assert itself ! Impossible that she could proceed to action , without hearing some warning voice inside her soul ! But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couldP145he be sure ? How could he know , except by trying ? If he should answer her questions , simply and straightforwardly , as she was asking them , at least that would bring him nearer to her , and make it easier for him to woo and win her in future time . And if it should turn out that she really was bad , and willing to " go the limit , " as the fast set among the young people in collegephrased it  --  well , why not with the nice Mr. Rusher , to whom she had made her overtures ? When he told her that some man was needed , her reply would seem to be obvious : Will you be the man ? Thunder rolling in the sky above Jed Rusher 's head , and an earthquake in the undermost deeps of him . He began to picture what it would mean to take possession of little Lulu Belle , and it caused such a tumult in him as he had never dreamed before . A trembling took his knees so that he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop and hold onto one of the tree-trunks that lined the street . The thought of the child , what she wanted , and what he might do to her , overwhelmed him ; yet he could not get away from it , he would never be able to get away from it . Twice before in his busy life Jed had fallen from the standards of morality his sister had impressed upon him : first with a girl in the Zion high school , and then with a rancher 's daughter on his selling campaign . Both times Jed had known that he was doing wrong , and had been full of shame and anxiety , and had broken off the relationship . In neither case had there been any element of idealism ; there could not have been , with Jed feeling about it as he did . Sex meant to him something sordid , animal , unworthy of the human , condemnedby both man and God ; the great trap which Satan set for the feet of young men , and the cause of failures strewing the pathway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the tempter !  --  he had managed to contrive it so that love , or sex , or whatever you called it , should be , not a barrier in the pathway , but the very pathway itself ! Hitherto Jed had said , if I look at this woman to lust after her , it may cost me my future ; but now he said , it will make my future  --  and what a difference that caused in his feelings ! Lulu Belle became suddenly the most beautifulof objects , the most alluring that life had so far presented . Jed recalled those physical charms which he had seen , and imagined those which he had not yet seen ; and about them all was a halo , a glory not of gold , or of diamonds  --  for all such images are cheap and vulgar , according to modern standards of wealth production . You could not even call it a halo of a million dollars ; you would have to explain it as that subtle , infinitely powerful glory which has been made by millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the world by a thousand elaborately contrived arts . Before that dreadful night was past , Satan had got full possession of Jed Rusher 's soul . If Lulu Belle wanted a baby , why should she not have one , and why should not Jed help her to her desire ? Fornication and sin it would be , no doubt ; but if he were to marry her as soon as possible , would n't that make it all right ? After the baby had come , she would be satisfied , and would make a devoted mother ; almost certainly she would settle down , as an adoring wife to a rising young financial genius . Seize the opportunity as it gallopsp147past , Jed , for that is what distinguishes the great man from the common run ! Pale and inconsequential seemed college , to a man with such things as this in his mind . Childish and trivial were the doings called " student activities , " and a bore were quadratic equations , and the poetry of Pope , and all the rest of it ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studies , he had nothing to say to his classmates , and he took to rambling in the evenings , driven by gales of strangely mingled emotion : exultation , terror , defiance , hesitation , longing . He wanted to see Lulu Belle again . Each day when he went to his work , he had but one thought : will she come ? He would imagine her entering the room , and every tap on the door would make his heart leap . He would think : what shall I say to her ? How shall I manage to get alone with her ? When quitting time came , and she had not come , he would be sick with frustration . He did not want his dinner ; he would wanderoff blindly again , his head full of mad schemes to telephone to her , to write her a letter , to suggest to her grandfather some reason for inviting her to call . Ile found out where her home was , a showy place in one of the ultra-smart suburban developments of Wallace J. Macy , Real @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way ; but when he came to the house , he could do no more than walk past ; for Mr. Macy , as a loyal " realtor , " believed in publicity and advertising , and everything he had was in plain view from the sightseeing busses . There was a wide- sweeping lawn , with no hedge , not even shrubbery behindwhich a lovelorn youth could lurk . Jed must keep walking , and could only gaze at the lights in the windows , and wonder : which is Lulu Belle 's room , and what will she be doing now ? And all the time with that disagreeable trembling of the knees , the cold chills running up and down his spine , the hot flushes mantling his cheeks ! Jed was frightened about himself , for he had never known such restlessness and distress . He could not eat , he could not sleep , nothing was right . Did men go crazy in such crises ? Or what did they do ? Jed had no idea , and there was no one he was willing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop thinking about the matter , and try to put his mind on study ; but suddenly from nowhere would come a wave of excitement that would bowl him over . A week passed ; and he was about desperate , and ready to ask Mr. Warrener if it could be that Lulu Belle was sick , when fortune favored him . The old gentleman had just fallen into a doze , and Jed was settled in the anteroom with a book , when suddenly the door opened  --  and there was Lulu Belle ! In an orange-colored " ensemble " this time  --  apparently the makers of frocks and accessories designed complete sets of these costly affairs for little rich girls . " Oh , how do you do , Mr. Rusher ? " she said , in her simple , friendly way . " How do you do , Lulu Belle . " He had decided that , no matter what she might say this time , he would beP149suave and self-possessed . " Your Grandpa has just gone to sleep . " " I think I 'll see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I have something I want to talk to you about , if you do n't mind . I 've decided I will tell you what you asked me to . " " Oh , Mr. Rusher ! " The child looked at him with the serious wide blue eyes . " I 've already found out . " " You have ? " " Yes . I met a boy , and I asked him about it , and he told me . " Jed 's mind started whirling again , but he kept his air of self-possession . " He told you ? And then ? " " Well , he said what we would have to do for me to have a baby , and he seemed to know about it , so we did it . " The tower of Jed 's hopes went toppling , and hit the ground in a cloud of dust . Speech failed him , he could only sit and stare . " It was very queer , " the child went on . " I never felt anything so strange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He is a very nice boy , and he says he is sure . " Still Jed could not find words . He sat with hands clenched , his features a mask behind which disappointment , rage , horror , curiosity , and  --  strange and shocklugas it might seem  --  desire were all mingled in another brainstorm . Meantime Lulu Belle was prattling on , utterly unaware of the tumult . " Oh , Mr. Rusher , I 'm so excited whenever f think that I may really be going to have a baby ! Tell me about it , wo n't you please ? "   " What , Lulu Belle ? " " Can  --  t be sure that it 's all right ? " " Just what did you do ? " Unholy curiosity drove him to this question . But here at last the long-sleeping instinct of self-protection began to warn the child . She answered him , but at the same time a blush began to steal over her cheeks and throat , and she stopped before she was quite through . " Was that right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a baby ? " " It may , Lulu Belle . " " But I ca n't be sure ? " " Not for a while . " " That 's what the boy said . When will I know ? " " It 's hard to say . It may be two or three months . " " And how will I know then ? " Jed bethought himself of conversations he had heard as a child among the wives of ranchers , who had assumed he was too young to heed or to understand . " You 're liable to feel a little queer . You may be sick at your stomach , and feel dizzy . " " How funny ! Why should it make me dizzy to have a baby ? " " Well , I do n't know , but that 's what I 've heard . " He paused a moment . He wanted to go on talking to her ; he could not let her go away from him . And besides , for her own good , he ought to warn her ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'll have to tell your mother . I 'm afraid she 's not going to like it , Lulu Belle . " " I suppose not . She has such strange ideas about babies . Can you think of any reason she wo n't like my having one ? "   " Well , you see , a girl is n't supposed to have one until she is married and has a husband . " This struck the other as funny . " What in the world would I do with a husband ? Why , I 'm only a child ! " " I know , but that 's how parents feel ; so you 'd better keep the secret as long as you can  --  and please do n't ever tell anybody that you told me . They would blame me for talking to you about it . I 'm only trying to help you , you understand . " " Oh , of course , Mr. Rusher , and I 'm much obliged to you . " " If there is any trouble , let me advise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me about it . " Jed was getting his self-possession now , and taking care of himself , like the shrewd man of the world he aspired to be . " Do n't let your mother do anything about it , or let anybody else do anything , without your telling me  --  because I am your friend , and I do n't want any harm to come to you . " " Oh , thank you , Mr. Rusher . I 'll do what you say , but I do n't think it 'll be any harm , because , you see , Mamma loves me dearly , even if she is queer about babies , and I 've never done anything to displease her before , so I know she 'll forgive me this once . " " Another thing , Lulu Belle  --  this boy you tell me about : is he a friend of the family 's ? " " Oh , yes . " " He 's a boy your mother would n't disapprove of ? " " No , Mamma knows his mother well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ name , so I can get in touch with him if necessary ? " " Oh , I promised him I would n't tell anybody , Mr. Rusher  --  never , never ! You see , he has nothing to doP152with this  --  he just did what I asked him to , and he said Mamma might be vexed with him . " " I see , " said Jed . " Well , do n't let anybody make you tell , and do n't tell them about me . But you 'd better try to see me now and then , and let me know how you feel and all about it . If there are things you need to know , I can look them up in books , or maybe ask somebody . I want to do everything I can to make it easy for you . " " Oh , thank you , " said Lulu Belle , and her child 's countenance radiated gratitude to this nice Mr. Rusher . " It 's a comfort to have some grown-up person in the secret , because of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first time I ever did anything without asking Mamma first . Maybe she 'll scold me , but she 'll think  --  " A tap of the bell in the invalid 's room  --  and so Jed had to wait to learn what Lulu Belle 's Mamma would think . P153COLLEGE examinations were at hand , and Jed Rusher had to make a desperate effort , and put out of mind all his Aladdin dreams , and buckle down to the realities of a cold and indifferent world . Instead of having love and riches and fame handed to him on a golden platter , he had to wrestle obscurely with the formulas of quadratic equations , and the poetry of Pope , and the military strategy of Von Moltke , and the exegesis of the New Testament . He had to suppressall that fever of desire in his heart  --  something which he was able to do only partly . He would never he quite the same man again ; he had eaten of the fruit of the tree of knowledge , and could no longer be so haughtily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impelled to look at them , and he decided that he would need a wife earlier in his career than he had previously planned . I le passed his examinations with reasonable credit . I t was easy when he put his mind on it ; but he realized now that he hated all his subjects , and was no longer a believer in higher education . He would have quit the university that summer , had it not been for the social position which his studentship gave him . He knew that this was the reason why Carrie Meecham and the elegant Miss Newcomb , the social secretary , were so cordial to him . He knew that if he were going to marry a rich girl , he would be greatly aided by putting on a cap and gown and being presented with a college degree . Old Mr. Warrener continued to stay alive , and even to get a little better ; there were traces of feeling in his legs , and now and then a flicker of hope stirred in the weary heart . He was having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while symptoms were told , and then while they were repeated to members of the family who came visiting . Jed 's sympathy was unfailing , and his grasp of the single tax in its ramified relationships became masterly . He never weakened in his contempt for such notions , but he understood them now , and could talk about them intelligently . He had his reward , in that his employer took another hour of his time each day , which raised his income to twentyeightdollars a week , a sum which would have seemed princely to the ranch-boy a year or two previously . The country was recovering slowly from the effects of the panic , and students were coming in greater numbersto the summer school ; so Liza 's boarding-house was thriving , and she was getting her debts paid off . Everything seemed well with the pair ; they were makingprogress , and should have been satisfied  --  had it not been for that insatiableness which was the mark of Jed as a great man . He was not interested in the slow accretion of gains , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the heights , and dreamed of getting there in a few swift bounds . Failing to do so , he chafed and fretted ; he was a hungry wolf lurking outside the wall of the beautiful Garden of Privilege . P155The job proved to be less interesting in the summertime , because so many of Mr. Warrener 's family and friends scattered to various parts of the world . Rich people could not stand the heat of summer in cities , it appeared ; they had homes on mountain-lakes , where they boated and fished and played golf and tennis . Their town-houses were closed , with the blinds all down , and only caretakers living over the garages , and gardeners sprinkling the lawns and trimming the hedges and pickingout the weeds from the flower-beds . In the society columns of the newspapers you read that " everybody " was away , and you believed this . The hundred thousandworking people of the city , with their families , stayed on and labored at their tasks without regard to heat ; but if you thought about these , you were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Warreners had an elaborate summer home , where Mrs. Lydia kept open house for her family and friends . But the invalid would not join them  --  there was too much of him to be moved , he said with his tragic smile . He had everything he wanted in town , and Davis and Rusher and Burke , the night nurse , and Jermin , the secretary , and Wilkins , the butler , and Nora , the second cook , would manage to keep him comfortable , while the children went off to play wherever they pleased . He had awnings at the half dozen windows of his room , and a big electric fan which turned in every direction ; he would be taken down into the garden tinder the shade trees , and the butler would bring him iced drinks , and his attendants would read to him , or play cribbage and let him beat them  --  it was not such a bad life . The single tax and so-called " liberal " papers came regularly , and these would be read and marked and clipped ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every week , and this gave great satisfaction to the old gentleman  --  fortifying him in his idea that the world was going to the demnition bowwowsbecause of its refusal to tax the rental value of land . He would write letters to the editors of his favorite publications , and now and then they would reply  --  Jed noticed that it was mostly when they were in need of funds . Mr. Warrener carried a large payroll , giving regular allowances to various subversive organizations , and also to a small army of pensioners , who had managed to get his sympathy in one way or another ; poor relations , former servants and employees , widows and orphans of old friends  --  Jed saw the pile of checks being signed , and the secretary told him the total came close to seventy thousand dollars a year . Jed could understand the distress of all the family at such a monstrous leak . A peaceful , bucolic existence , but lacking in charm for Jed Rusher , for the reason that he no longer got the precious " tips " from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his family to the seashore of California , where they stayed in a splendid hotel , havingthe indispensable convenience of a broker 's office with ticker-service in the lobby , so that the old gentlemancould sit all morning and watch the quotations . He no longer strolled in to Mr. Warrener 's sick room , and Jed Rusher might as well have spent the summer in the Antarctic regions , where the sun ceases to rise . P157Mr . Claude junior and his wife were also gone ; impossible to expect such elegant people to expose their costumes and complexions to the vulgar effects of perspiration . Mr. Clive Warrener , Claude junior 's father , had come back from Europe , but not to Mountain City . He wrote to explain that financial conditions now seemed to favor a merger of some of his interests , and he would have to be near New York while arrangements were being worked out . He and his wife would make their summer headquarters at Newport , unless his father needed him at home . Mr. Clive had a " cottage " there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had to revise his idea of what the word meant , when he heard one of the letters read aloud , mentioning that the family was entertaining a score of guests . Mr. Clive had a passion for building great houses , it appeared , and calling them by such modest names . He had a " camp " two or three hours from Mountain City , which one of his married daughters was occupying this summer . He had a " bungalow " at Miami , in Florida , and would run down there for a month or two in the winter . His wife insisted upon having a home wherever they went , because she could not stand the promiscuityof hotels . Now that so much of the husband 's business had to be transacted in Europe , they were getting ready to build a modern home in Paris , where none could be bought , because they did not exist : at least , so Claude junior 's wife remarked , casually . Listening with ears alert , Jed Rusher learned that modern business does not have to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ important enough , you can have the business come to you , and talk over " deals " in your library , or while you are playing billiards or golf . Only a few words may be required , often just a statement of a price , and you make a memo in a notebook , and later your secretary sees to the making out of papers , and your lawyers go over them , and come to dinner at your home , and chat things over in the evening . Jed saw this happen more than once in Mr. Warrener 's bedroom ; he saw hundreds of thousands of dollars " made " in that way , and he was duly impressed , and determined to take life with that kind of royal ease . Mr. Wallace J. Macy was promoting a magnificent real estate project on Lake Katandin , in Eureka Canyon , something over a hundred miles in the mountains . It could be reached in less than two hours from the heart of Mountain City , so he announced with magnificentdisdain for the traffic laws of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspapers ; he got your name from various exclusive lists , and sent you every now and then a sumptuous illustrated circular , in the name of the Katandin Associates , which was supposed to be a cooperative enterprise , and no doubt would be , after Mr. Macy had got through with his selling campaign . You were not asked to buy real estate , but to consent to be entertained by an exclusive and elegant club ; and if you would indicate your interest , a high-powered car would appear , driven by a high-powered salesman , and you could leave after lunch and be home for dinner again . One of the sights of the place was the new " camp " which Mr. Macy himself had erected , with ten " mastersuites , " each with its private bath , for guests . A mostP159impressive structure , and only after the " prospects " had made their purchase would they discover that the " camp " was empty a good part of the time . The reason was a quarrel between the practical " developer " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as bait for his schemes . This was the third time she had been moved to a new subdivision , so she declared to her father , and it was to be the last . She was going to have a home where her own friends lived , and this summershe was visiting them . So it happened that Lulu Belle Macy did sonic movingabout , and each time she would pass through MountainCity with her mother , and they would stop to see the head of the family and tell him the news . Twice the visit was in the afternoon , and Jed heard about the mother 's troubles . On the second occasion , he learned that they were on the way to visit Mrs. Lydia Warrener , and that Cousin Marian Barton was there , and Lulu Belle was in raptures because she was going to see Baby Lydia again . " I declare , " said the mother , " I ca n't understand this child 's insane infatuation over babies ; I think she would spend the summer taking care of that infant , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat in the room during these visits , but had no chance for a word apart with the child . Once or twice there was a quick exchange of glances , or a smile , just to remind them both of the secret they shared between them . Jed had only to look at Lulu Belle to see that all was going well ; her checks and arms and shoulders were covered with freckles , which her mother declared was a horrifying thing , but what could she do , the child simply would stay out on the water or in it , and the swimming suits the women wore nowadays took no account of esthetics . When Mrs. Jane Macy talked about these suits , she sounded exactly like Liza  --  only she went more into detail , for the reason that she saw the suits every day , and the young people in them , whereas Liza only saw the pictures in the Sunday rotogravures . Lulu Belle sat , smiling amiably , not understanding at all why Mamma was so worried . She was delighted with a dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this hot July afternoon . She liked her skirts short , because they were better for running , and if she uncrossedher knees and pulled the ends of the skirts down , it was because Mamma frowned at her , and made angry signs . Mamma had been threatening to put longer skirts on her , but now , by good luck , the grown ladies were cutting their skirts short , so that you could no longer tell them from the girls . All the world was getting younger , it appeared , even the Grandmas , and i f they were putting paint on their cheeks and lips , Lulu Belle thought that was fun , and would have liked to try it herself . Jed sat devouring her with his eyes , as much as he dared , and the fever reawakened in his heart . He had definitely decided by now that he had missed a great opportunity ; he wondered if he 'd ever have another , and registered a vow not to miss it . His impatience was mounting day by day ; he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any money , just wasting time listening to a poor old sick man say the same things over and over !  |p161Mrs  . Emily Evarts , oldest daughter of the Warrener line  --  that magnificent lady who had so insulted Jed by a casual nod when he was introduced to her  --  had departed some time back , taking her two daughters , Janet and Claudia , to London for the " season " ; thence they were going to Deauville for the bathing , and thence to Paris for their shopping . Claudia , named after her grandfather , was something of a tomboy , resembling him in her fondness for having her own way and saying what she thought . Jed had never seen her , because she had been at boarding-school in the East ; but now she wrote long gossipy letters in fashionable handwriting  --  to be known as such because it used up great quantitiesof expensive stationery . Old Mr. Warrener 's eyes were giving him trouble , so Jed would read these letters aloud , and they were highly educational . He learned the names @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the names of their castles , and what was in them , paintings , and suits of armor which may or may not have had men inside . It seemed that you could no longer trust British titles , but had to investigate carefully ; some of them were vulgar brewers and pork-packers and hardware merchants , exactly the sort of people you would meet in Mountain City , so what was the use of crossing a continent and an ocean ? There were diamond-merchantsfrom South Africa , who had begun their careers smuggling unregistered gems out of the country , and now they had bought themselves titles  --  and still , said the lively Miss Claudia , they talk about Uncle Paul having ; bought his way into the Senate ! Old Mr. War- rener chuckled at this , and sent Jed to consult his files , heading " U. S. Senate , " subheading " Corruption , " for an article explaining the difference between England and America  --  that in the latter country it was illegal to buy a seat in the upper house , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Deauville , and the entertaining spectacle of the highest European nobility and finance exhibiting themselves in the near-altogether , to be photographed for the Sunday supplements of the world . Most of it could n't be described to one 's Grandpa , said the modest Claudia ; but that morning she had taken a stroll with the charming Comte de Pistache , or something like that , who had first tried to find out exactly how rich her family was , and what they would pay for a husband , and then had pointed out on the strand the formermistress of his brother , and another exquisite painted lady who had once blackmailed his uncle , and a third who was a celebrated gambler , and was now entertaininga prince from Senegambia . Claudia , the night before , had run away from her hotel and won several hundred thousand francs in a gambling palace , but the trouble was , the franc was dropping so fast that what you won at night was no good in the morning . Then Paris : the Champs-Elysees , the beautiful buildings , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in America ? And the Louvre , she had looked at rows and rows of Madonnas , till they were all a blur , but the silly tourists with the little red guide-books never got tired of raving over them .. And the great Arch of Triumph , with the tomb of the unknown soldier  --  and so many thousands of known soldiers begging on the streets , or selling matches . And the taxi-drivers , P163who gave you lead francs , and quarreled with you if you refused them . And the shops , with the merchants so ravenous , and half a dozen different sets of prices , the lowest for the French , the next for Italians and Spanish , and then for South Americans , then for Germans , then for British , and finally  --  higher than all the others put together  --  for any one who looked or talked like an American ! Mamma had learned to wrangle with them ; she would enter the very best shops , and let them do all the trying on and fitting and everything , and then she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throw up their hands and nearly ( lie , and she would walk out , and they would let her go , and then come running after her on the street and accept her price . But most of the Americans did n't have the nerve to do that , and paid the asking price ; it was the French people 's way of getting back the war-debt money  --  which they had n't paid and never would , declaredthe sapient Claudia . Then another letter ; they were coming home in a few clays , they had their passage on the Ruritania . Mamma had bought the loveliest things , dresses and jewels for all the family ; the customs charges would bankrupt them all . Mamma had found a double string of matched pearls , the most exquisite that she had ever seen : it was whispered they had been smuggled out of Russia , having been the property of one of the grand duchesses . Of course one could n't be sure , but such things were happening in Europe now . The price had been in dollars , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man whom she trusted come over from London to examine and appraise them , and had insisted that afterwards they should be locked up in the care of an American bank while the dickering about the price was going on . It had all been quite a strain , but they had them safe now , sewed up in one of Mamma 's garters . Jed Rusher was too ignorant about the affairs of the great world to realize what this last statement implied ; but he learned a few days later , when a kind fate willed it that Mrs. " Lou " Eddystone , second daughter of Mr. Warrener , stopped by on her way to California to visit friends and see a famous golf tournamentplayed off . Mr. Warrener got out his granddaughter'sletter , and Mrs. Lou read it aloud again , and then talked about it , in her free and easy way . It happenedthat Jed was not in the sick room , but in the anteroom , reading , and the door between the two rooms was shut . Mrs. Lou failed to realize how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care  --  impossible to say . Jed did not dare to listen at the keyhole , because some one night come into the anteroom from the hall and catch him . But he slid his chair as close to the door as could be considered accidental , and then he sat , pretending to read , but holding his hand cupped to his ear , straining for every sound . He missed some of the words , but got the sense . " I suppose Emily is going to bring them in without declaring them as usual . . . I know , they all do it , but they do n't all talk about it like Claudia . . . . Some day they 'll get caught . . . the government . . . offering rewards . . . advertisements calling for informers . . . the Jewelers ' Protective Association . . . notices onP165all the steamers . . . the government pays big rewards . . . twenty-five percent of the recovery . . . servants always spying on you . . . secret agents picking up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . remember how Mrs. Jimmie Clyde got caught . . Jed Rusher , in his impatience and balked ambition , had been like a hunter who files down the trigger-catch of his gun , until it will go off at the slightest touch . Never again would he be caught napping ! Never would he fail to know an opportunity when it crossed his path ! So now while the voice of Mrs. Lou was still booming , he was on his feet , and picked up his chair and set it back by the window , far from the door ; he took his book and tiptoed to the door which led to the outside corridor , and went out , leaving the door open . He went down the corridor , and downstairs to the library . Mr. Warrener had mentioned a couple of books he wanted , and right now was the time to be getting them  --  so that never could Jed be suspected of having overheard that conversation ! Another fever of excitement , another Aladdin dream ! But do n't fall down this time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , efficient , deadly  --  be a great man ! Take time enough to make sure what you want to do  --  and then do it ! Twenty-five percent of the recovery ! Jed had no idea what penalty the government might exact for attemptsat smuggling , but it would have to be heavy , if it were to deter smugglers ; any one could see that it must be greater than the duty on the imported articles . And pearls must be worth a lot of money ! Being inexperiencedin the great world , and still with the crude notions of a ranch-boy , Jed guessed that a string of pearls which had once belonged to a Russian grand duchess might be worth five or ten thousand dollars . He had a vague idea that customs tariffs ran to twenty or thirty percent ; so that his reward would double his present capital , and put him in position to make use of Mr. Evarts ' stock market " tips " in the coming autumn ! " They never reveal your name , " Mrs. Lou had said ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Protective Association . " He must find out about it ; but how ? He looked in the telephone book , but evidently there was no such organization in MountainCity . When Mrs. Lou left , Jed went back to the sick room , carrying the books that were wanted , and apologizing carefully for his absence , so as to impress it upon his employer 's mind . He was cool and untroubled , and completed his duties and took his departure at the usual hour . As soon as he was a safe distance from the Warrenerhome , he went into a drug-store which had a telephone booth , and dropped a nickel into the slot and called the most fashionable jewelry store in town , asking for the manager . " Can you tell me of an organization called the Jewelers ' Protective Association ? " " It 's the American Jewelers ' Protective Association , " replied the voice . " It 's in New York . " " Do you happen to know the street address ? " " I can look it up . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and then thanked the man , and hung up . He jotted down the address on a scrap of paper , and then called another jewelry store , and asked for the manager , and politely inquired as to the duty on imported jewelry , and learned that it was eighty per-P167cent on the foreign wholesale value . He thanked his informant cordially , and went on his way , several times as rich as before he had phoned ! Here was a problem which a man could properly talk over with his sister , and it would be a comfort to Jed to have Liza 's moral backing . Perhaps he would have hesitated to ask for it , had he not felt so certain of getting it ! He took Liza up to her room and locked the door , and in a whispered voice told her what he had learned . What did she think about it ? Was he justified in makinguse of information he had got in the Warrener home ? Or would he be a spy and a betrayer ? Liza 's reaction was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a smuggler , is n't she ? " " Yes , of course . " " She is breaking the laws of the country , cheating the government ! It 's your plain duty to report her . " " That 's the way it struck me . " " As a matter of fact , I think you 're required to do it ; a lawyer would say you could be punished if you did n't . You would be some sort of accessory to her law-breaking . " " I had n't thought of that , " said Jed , much comforted . He could hardly be expected to go to jail for Mrs. Emily Evarts , who had so persistently snubbed him . Liza knew all about the haughty Mrs. Emily ; having collected and collated every scrap of information which Jed brought home about his job . Liza was far more class-conscious than her brother  --  not having his ab- solute assurance of joining the dwellers in the Garden of Privilege . " Those selfish and unscrupulous women think they are above all laws , both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to us to help them in their crimes . " " All right , " said Jed ; " I 'll report her . Whether we get any of the penalty or not , we 'll teach her not to cheat the government . " Jed had not been a member of Mr. Crumback 's church for ten years without learningto put his actions upon the highest available moral grounds . " How much time have we ? " asked the sister . " The letter said a few days . They are coming on a steamer called the Ruritania . " Jed was gripped by sudden anxiety . Suppose he were too late again ! He did not dare to phone from the house , but went out to a drug-store , where there was a quiet booth . From there he phoned to the omniscient young lady at the public library ; she referred him to the " information " clerk at the depot , who looked the matter up and told him that the Ruritania was due in New York on Thursday , three days off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new element of danger . He went back to Liza , and the two of them worked out a plan of campaign which they felt was safe . Jed hurried to the depot , and took an evening train out of the city , and two hours later he got off at the town of Edmonton , which was nothing but a name to him . He went into the depot , and set down before the busy agent a night letter telegram , addressed to the American Jewelers ' Protective Association in New York : " Mrs. Thomas J. Evarts arriving steamer Ruritania with valuable jewels undeclared sewed upon person . P169Letter follows identifying present informant . Henry T. Jones . " The busy agent took this message , counted the words , and never even lifted his eyes to Jed . Offers of produce for sale , orders to buy stocks , invitations to dinner , inquiriesabout dying relatives  --  it was all in a night 's work to him . " Sixty-five cents , " he said , and Jed put down the correct change , and made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little town until it was time for a train back to the city . Next morning he mailed a registered letter to the American Jewelers ' Protective Association , informing them that he was the person who had sent a telegram from the town of Edmonton , giving information concerningMrs . Thomas J. Evarts . He had not wished to telegraph his real name , but he now gave it , and requested that the reward should be paid to him . And now , hold your breath , Jed Rusher ! Hold your breath , Liza , and practice patience for two days and three nights ! No use to expect any word in the meantime ; no chance that anybody on hoard the palatial Ruritania will remove the garter of a staid and haughty matron , who occupies with her two daughters one of the most expensive suites on the highest deck ! No news , until the steamer has docked , and the customs examination is under way , and the agents of the governmenthave got to work  --  with the agents of argus -- eyed journalism peering over their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was " on pins and needles . " He had no idea what time the steamer might reach New York , but he knew that the moment the story was telegraphed to the Mountain City " Mail , " the telephone would ring by Mr. Warrener'sbedside , and if Jed happened to be present he would have the task of appearing unconcerned until the old gentleman told him the news  --  after which he would have to be properly horrified . Quite a job of acting , which Jed rehearsed over and over again , never entirely to his satisfaction . But , as it happened , he did not have to face this ordeal . The steamer docked at noon , which was ten o'clock in the morning by mountain time , and an hour or so later Jed was standing before a bulletin-board in front of the " Mail " office , when a clerk came out and pasted up this item : " New York . Mrs. Thomas J. Evarts of Mountain City , arriving on the steamer Ruritania from London to-day , was detained and searched by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of valuable jewels which she had failed to declare . The seizure included a double string of pearls and many diamonds , all of which had been sewed up in Mrs. Evarts ' apparel . The customs authorities declared from a hurried examinationthat they believed the value of the gems would aggregate at least a hundred thousand dollars . " Jed turned and walked quickly away . He had to stop and hold on to a mail-box at the corner to steady himself . At least a hundred thousand dollars ! The duty would be eighty thousand , and Jed 's share would be twenty thousand ! His fortune was made ! His fight was won ! P171TREMENDOUS excitement in " social circles " in MountainCity ; which meant not merely the rich , but the tens of thousands of hangers-on and readers of newspapergossip . The " Mail " put the story on the front page , with a " streamer head " : SOCIETY LEADER NABBED BY CUSTOMS OFFICERSHID GEMS IN GARTER BUT THEY GOT THEM ! The telegraphed dispatch was expanded by details about the Evarts and Warrener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ learned later on that there was some sort of political quarrel between Evarts , the banker , and " T. J. , " publisherof the " Mail , " which accounted for the story 's being " played up . " Some one came in to lunch at the boarding-house with a copy of the early edition , and then what an outburst of conversation ! All these rich women were smugglingall the time ; as a rule they got away with it , but this one had slipped up . Somebody must have told on her ; probably she had talked indiscreetly on the steamer . What would she do now ? Would they put her in jail ? Could you ever put any rich woman in jail ? I low much would they make her pay ? Or would the family " pull " get her off ? The boarders were lacking in information , and Jed and Liza kept mum  --  not a word , now , or ever ! Jed looked forward uneasily to meeting his employer that afternoon ; but he found that he had nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's misfortune with surprising nonchalance ; she was " free , white , and twenty-one , " he said , and if she wanted to turn smuggler , it was her affair . The old gentleman 's attitude to the moral question involved was a surprising one  --  never in a thousand years could Jed have anticipated it . Ile did not consider that his daughter had been robbing the government ; he considered that the government was robbing his daughter . A tax on imports was a mere act of force , in defiance of natural right . A tax on land values was just , becauseland was the gift of nature ; but manufactured articles , such as mounted jewelry , were the product of human labor , and the state had no right to deprive any person of the fruits of labor . Jed listened respectfully while this was explained to him , in between two telephonecalls . Relatives called up to express their horror , and friends their sympathy . Presently , long distance calling ; Mr. Warrener 's wife , apparently close to tears , for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had bumped its nose . No , they were not disgracedforever , they would soon be lifting their heads again ; the public 's memory was short . Yes , it was embarrassing that Emily had chosen an indecent hidingplace , but after all , most everybody wore garters , and the secret could not be permanently kept . Emily would be well taken care of ; Tom was already on a trainp173for New York , and he would get the best lawyers , and they would patch it up . No , of course they had n't put her in jail , they had simply seized the jewels , and threatened to confiscate them , but of course they would n't do that , Tom would pull some wires in New York and Washington and they would pay a fine , enough to satisfy the newspapers , and Emily would wear her jewels at a ball and enjoy the advertising . Mrs. Lydia must have resented that , for the old gentlemanchuckled , and added , " That 's all right , take it out on me instead of Emily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listening , getting new light upon his affairs . Mr. Thomas J. Evarts had gone to New York , to employthe best lawyers , and pull political wires , and reducethe reward to which Jed was justly entitled ! Indignation flamed in his heart , but he could n't very well employ lawyers to demand that Mrs. Evarts should pay the full penalty ! He would sit helpless , while the underground intrigue went on , and his newly made fortune trickled away ! But he learned his lesson ; beforelong he would find out where these underground wires ran , and he too would be able to hire the best lawyers , and see to the protection of his interests in New York and Washington ! Jed in his heart was glad that Mr. Warrener took his family misfortune so lightly . After all , he had ! wen kind to Jed , and Jed would have been sorry to hurt him . Especially Jed was glad that Mr. Warrener seemed to have no suspicions . Jed could n't see how anybody could fail to suspect him , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was foolinghis employer . A fortunate circumstance that Mr ' ..  |p174Lou  had taken a train for California the previous day ! She would certainly recollect what she had said , and the fact that Jed might have overheard her . Would she write that to her father ? Apparently she did not ; for the days passed , and Jed saw no sign of reticence or distrust . The old gentlemankept his quiet smile , which exasperated Jed , because it appeared to involve a sense of superiority on the other 's part ; he was mocking at all the things which Jed believed in and ardently desired . He would drop remarks , suggestive of the idea that money was not really so important as other people thought it . But all the while , here he was using his money to keep himself in a palace , with eight or ten able-bodied men and women to wait upon him all the time ! Jed thought himself just as good , morally and in every other way , as people who fooled themselves into believing that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ episode of the customs seizure , Jed came into the room and found his employer in one of his quizzical moods . He looked at the younger man with that sly smile and said : " Rusher , can you think of any reason why I should want to make any more money ? " " I do n't know , sir , " said Jed , trying to meet him halfway . " I have never seen your hank-book . " Said the other : " People are forever writing me , tellingme of ways to make money . But why should I ? " " Mostly it is they who want to make the money , Mr. Warrener . "   " They offer to go shares with me . They have everything you can think of on earth , from perpetual motion machines to cancer cures . I do n't know how they get my name  --  there must be sucker lists ' for sale , and I am on them . " " You make the mistake of being too kind-hearted , " remarked Jed , tactfully . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The old gentleman reached over to his table . " This sounds more plausible than the average , and the man may have something . But I was lying here thinking , why should I want to make any more money ? " " There are others who could use it very well , sir . " " Can they , Rusher ? I watch them trying , and I do n't see much success . " There was a pause . Jed had his eye on the letter , which was apparently about to be shown to him ; so he did not encourage general philosophy . " Tell me , " said the other , suddenly , " do you know anything about oil ? " Jed was about to say , " Nothing at all , " but he checked himself . One of the rules he had been laying down , as a result of watching the rich and powerful , was never to admit ignorance unless you have to . Be silent , and you will get credit for a lot more wisdom than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing the game , " he said . " I 've heard a lot of talk , of course , and picked up some information . " " Read that , " said the other , and handed over a small sheet of ruled paper from a pad , written in a cramped hand with a lead pencil . It ran : Dear Sir : I am the Mister Jim Nichols whos Father worked for your gardner years ago . He left us this ranch it is not good being dry too much and we have not made a go , but I think now we have oil . We have many signs on the ground and some others say so to , but it is so far away the oil men has never found us it is twentysixmile from the T. and W. branch railroad and it is a bad road and hard to get to but if you will come to see my brother and I we will show you and it would make money for both of us .

" " It sounds honest , " said Jed , cautiously . " I think I remember Nichols , but I ca n't be sure  --  so many men come and go . But I suppose I ought to look into their story . " " Yes , sir , " said Jed , expectantly . He understood perfectly the old gentleman 's psychology . Mr. Warrenerwas being invited into a poker game ; his hands were itching for the cards , but he dallied and fooled around a while , pretending that he was above such weaknesses of mortal mind . Jed must handle him carefully , not trying to force him , but playing him as one would a fish on a line . " There are plenty of oil people who 'd be glad to look into it , " Jed ventured . " My son 's wife 's family are oil people  --  the Sandersons ; I might turn it over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oil men who are square-shooters , I have n't happened to know them . It is a highly competitiveindustry. "  | " So I have observed , " said Jed , sagely . " I suppose it 's the uncertainties , the risks they have to run . " " What came to my mind was this , Rusher : would you like to have a vacation ? " " I had n't thought of it , Mr. Warrener . " " I try to arrange for every one I employ to get a couple of weeks off . " " But I have n't been with you long enough , sir . " " Four months , I think , is n't it ? That ought to entitle you to one week anyhow . Would you like to run up and take a look at this land and report to me ? " " But how would you get along without me ? " " My sister-in-law insists that she is coming back to town ; and she 's always glad to read to me . I could make out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I thought was , you 're not an oil expert , but you 're a judge of human nature , and you might talk with these two fellows , and hear what they have to say , and then , if it seems worth while , I could send an oil man out to make a further investigation . I suppose you would n't mind the trip . " " I 'd enjoy it  --  if I were sure it would n't inconvenience you . " " I 'd continue your salary , and pay your traveling expenses in addition . I do n't think the town is more than five or six hours away by the railroad , so you could do the whole thing in less than a week . Do you want to take a chance on it ? " " Of course , Mr. Warrener ; I 'm grateful to you for such confidence . " " ' That 's all right , I know you want to get ahead , and this may he an opportunity . If anything comes of it , I 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I wouldn'tP178mention the matter to anybody ; that 's one of the first lessons to learn in business  --  and especially anything speculative like oil . " " Of course , Mr. Warrener , count on me not to say a word . When should I start ? " " Miss Lucile expects to be here the day after tomorrow , and any day after that would suit me . You can look up the trains and make your plans . " Jed found out about the trains , but that did not take him long ; he had a more important thing he wanted to know about . IIe went to the omniscient lady at the information desk at the library , who told him there were articles in the encyclopedias , and technical books on oil drilling , oil geology , and so on . Jed took these home , and sat up most of the night devouring their contents and putting them into note-books . Here was studying into which he could really put his heart . and soul ! He realized that in the time he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he might have mastered various departments of modern industry and finance , and been prepared for the future . Oh , the farce of the thing called education ! Yet he had to admit that Mountain City University had served him . If it had not been for that endowmentdrive , he would never have got near Mr. Warrener ; nor would he have been taken into a home of wealth , if it had not been for his studentship . It was a fact that colleges had a purpose  --  though an obscure one , which only a clear-seeing mind like Jed 's could fathom . P179The ominiscient librarian told him that there were trade papers about oil in the reading-room , and they could be purchased on the news-stands . Pages and pages of gossip and rumors about the various fields in this and other states ; the prices of stocks and their prospects ; articles on the technique of drilling , and of refining , on the world supply and the state of the market , on the personalities of the various " big men " in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equipment and tools , everything having to do with the work . This was what the oil men themselveshad to tell Jed ; and after he had made the necessaryallowances for the necessary trade lies , he had real knowledge about an industry in which fortunes were being made overnight . Jed went to the second-hand book stores and got several volumes , which , with the magazines , helped to fill up the suit-case he took on his trip . All the time on the train , going and coming , and at spare times in hotel rooms , he was ripping out the contents of these publications , and storing them away in his ravenous mind . So impatient he had been , so eager  --  and here at last he had got a start . Clear the way for Jed Rusher , oil man ! Yet quickly he found himself beginning to qualify that title ; he was going to be an oil man in a certain sense , and up to a certain point . There were fellows who went out into the field and bossed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they lived a hard-workingand uneasy life , with many risks , and only a gamtiler'schance for the big profits . But there were others who sat at desks in offices , and gave the orders ; they organizedcorporations , and floated stock issues , and formed mergers and holding companies and what not  --  and these were the ones who made the real money , the ones who were safe , no matter what might happen in the field  --  dry wells , or salt water , fires , explosions , labor troubles , all the burdens and cares incidental to the manipulating of stubborn matter , and still more stubborn human nature . Clear the way for Jed Rusher , oil financier ! On the morning of the first of September Jed had bought his ticket to the town of Mesa Verde , on the T. and W. railroad , and was all ready for the trip , when he picked up a copy of the early edition of the " Mail , " and on the front page in staring headlines he read : SOCIAL LIGHT PAYS FINEJEWEL @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thomas J. Evarts of Mountain City had settled her case with the customs authorities by the payment of duty and penaltiesamounting to seventy-three thousand , four hundred and eighty-two dollars and seventy-six cents . Jed had already performed many times in his mind the operation of dividing various large sums of money by four . He now did it once more , and found that he was to get from the American Jewelers ' Protective Associationthe sum of eighteen thousand , three hundred and seventy dollars and sixty-nine cents . Be sure you do this sum in short division correctly , 0 benevolent and protective jewelers  --  and do n't leave off the cents ! Jed took the paper home to Liza , and they had aP181quiet celebration , locked up in her room in the hot top-story of the boarding-house . Then they had a talk  --  a terrifying one for Liza , for it is no simple job to ride in the chariot of a great man . Said Jed : " I 'm liable to spend this money for oil land before I get back . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " " I 'm sure to get it ; that part is settled , I 'm entitled to it under the law . I 've looked it up in the library . " " But how can you spend it till you have it ? " " That 's the point I want to talk about . Suppose I find something really worthwhile up there  --  you would n't want me to let it slide , would you ? In the oil-game , to-morrow may be too late  --  some other fellowgets in ahead of you . " " But , Jed , you do n't know anything about the oil-game . " " Do n't fool yourself , I know something , and I 'm goingto know more after I get there . I 'm not going to let anybody play me for a sucker . But I want to be free to act , if I should see anything that calls for action . " " What do you mean to do ? " " I want to take some money with me , so that I can buy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bind the bargainwith a small payment down , and you have until the escrow comes through to get the rest of the money . " Not for nothing had Jed spent two years being wooed by Carrie Meecham , assistant to a department manager of a big hank ! Carrie had talked incessantly about real estate purchases , how they were clone , and the variouspit falls ; every item of which information was now classified and collated , ready for service in Jed 's mind " How much do you want , Jed ? " " I 've got close to eight hundred at the post office , and I 'll draw that out , and get a cashier 's check or something that will be as good as cash . You had better put your two hundred in with me , because a thousand is a convenient sum to spend . I might buy quite a lot of land , because I wo n't mind a mortgage ; that do n't amount to anything , when it 's a question of oil . " " Jed , you frighten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Liza , you ca n't get anywhere in this world without taking risks . Be sure I 'm not going to take any I can help . If you put in your money with mine , you may get a return that 'll fix you for life . " In the end he persuaded his sister to part with her pitiful savings , which she had got by wearing herself to skin and bone , driving a maid and a cook to serve a dozen boarders , and doing all the left-over jobs herself . A part of the money was then actually due to Tarrie Meecham , but Carrie could wait , as she had waited before . Liza 's little " nest-egg , " and what came out of it , was to make one of the classic tales of Americanfinancial miracles , which would be repeated in newspapers , and in the gossip of oil trade journals ; all the more picturesque , because of that frightened state of mind , that trembling of the fingers as she wrote the check , and the pleading anguish in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brother . " Oh , Jed ! Do be careful ! It 's every cent we have ! "  | A dust-storm was raging when Jed descended from the train at the lonely little station of Mesa Verde . The air was full of blinding , choking grit , and it was impossible to travel ; he had to lie up in a country hotel . It was just such country and such misbehavior of the elements as Jed had been used to in Alamito , and it brought him a vivid reminder of his change in fortunes . How he pitied the poor devils in khaki and blue cotton shirts who had to live out on these Godforsakenplains and face the insanities of nature ; beaten by winds , choked by dust , broiled by the sun , frozen in blizzards , and toiling , toiling and sweating without respite ! What a contrast with the life of the Warrenersin their mansion , safe against all storms , with a central heating system in winter , and electric fans in summer , to say nothing of camps on mountain lakes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sit at a big desk of polished mahogany , provided with a row of push-buttons and a telephone , and give orders which meant prosperity or ruin , life or death , to thousands of these helpless and ignorant yokels ! Jed had learned at the university all the terms of contempt for country people : they were " hayseeds , " they were " rubes , " they were " hicks . " Jed talked with the hotel-keeper and refugees from the storm , and learned all he could about the country . It was several hundred miles from the place of Jed 's birth , but just the same kind of bare plains , on which sheep and cattle roamed ; it was bordered by mountains , with valleys having water , where wheat and some fruit were grown . No one said anything about oil , P184nor did Jed . When he had learned all there was to learn , he shut himself up in a room and studied his books , being careful to keep them locked in his suitcasemeanwhile . Next morning the sun rose red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there had been no rains for a month , and a car traveling over the plains left a cloud of dust half a mile behind it . Jed had engaged a battered old Ford for ten dollars a day , with a driver who went by the name of Jake . Jed was looking for a cattle ranch , he said ; he had been raised on such a ranch near Alamito , and had inherited money , and wanted land of his own . A dang good plenty for sale , said Jake ; most everything but what the county had bought for unpaid taxes . If the visitor had real cash with him , it would be the first these here ranchers had seen for many a day . Which way should they go ? asked Jake ; and the other said he had heard there was good land up towards Coyote Arroyo . Jake replied what the heck , they could n't raise nothin ' up there , when it rained it come all of a sudden and washed the fellers out . But Jed said he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishing . Jake said , sure , if he wanted to live off fish and venison , but he thought Jed was talking about beef . Towards the mountains they went , and presently left the main road , where it had been possible to go as fast as fifteen miles an hour , and were on trails where a good average was five . The bumps were of all sizes , the bigger the better ; you went down into a wash and came up on the other side , and the only trouble was that some of the rocks were too high for the clearance of a car , P185and Jed and the driver would take turns hopping out and rolling them away . The road kept dividing , where various path-seekers had tried to avoid rocks and gullies . But Jake said he knew the way and most of the time he seemed to be speaking the truth . He was a mine of information , which Jed worked diligently . They talked land and land prices ; you could pay anywhere from a dollar an acre to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know what you wanted and how to tell it . There was some alkali , and it come right next to the best land , and that made it easy to play the sucker . Every other feller up in these hills thought he had gold or coal or something , and was always diggin ' and prospectin ' , and bringin ' in capitalistsand tryin ' to get ' em to bite , but they was generallyslow with their mouths . How would anybody ship anything out of country like this ? Midday , and they were coming to the timber , but there was a bare saddle-back they had to go over , and the driver thought they better lay off and get their dinner at a ranch that was up under them trees , belonged to a feller named Cudliff , used to live down to Mesa Verde , he had some thousand acres in here , and funny thing , he had a little private oil well , all to hisself . " How come ? " said Jed , with the utmost indifference that a man could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you see , he dug a water well , and for a while it come good water , but then it begun to get scummy , and the first thing you know it was no good becausep186of oil on top ; the oil kep ' a comin ' , and it fist took the water well complete . Now Ed , he goes there and takes him a pail with a rove , and he dips him up a barrel o ' oil . " " What does he do with it ? " " He 's got him some kind of a steam engyne , that runs a pump and irrigates his land . He 's a-goin ' to put out young apple and pear trees , they tell me . " " How long has he had this ? " " I du n no exactly . I heard about it two or three months . " " Too bad he 's so far away from everything , " said Jed , " where it would n't pay to drill a real well . " There was a low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poplars on the north and west to shelter it from the high winds . The Ford tooted , and forth came Mr. Edward Cudliff , chewing his cud , as Jed was led to reflect ; he was six feet four , tanned to leather , and had evidently just been hauling oil before he went to dinner , for there stood at one side a cart with a barrel in it , both smeared with black . Mr. Cudliff 's cheek also had a smear , and you could see where he had washed it off his hands , but not off his wrists . He had a napkin tucked in his neck , and a hunk of salt pork in his mouth , and he told the visitors to come right in and set . There was a large family of youngsters , all with their mouths full , all silent and staring , and Ed made a place on each side of him , one for Jake and the other for Jed , and the three of them ate the food they had been used to all their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk all their lives . Presently Jake let it out that Jed was up here to buy a ranch , and like every other rancher in the entire west ,  |p187Ed  had a place that was for sale at a price , and he started in to talk it up . No better land anywhere in this region , not a trace of alkali on it , a crick that was never dry , some good timber  --  look at this here house  --  and fences in good order , stock thrivin '  --  and best of all , this here wonder they had come onto  --  jist come have a look at our oil well . Jed said yes , he had heard about it , but that was n't in his line , he did n't know anything about oil , and what could you do with it up here ? Ed said he was already doin ' a lot , and was goin ' to do more ; some day he 'd git him an oil stove , and heat his house with it . " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wood you want , it 's just as much trouble to get oil . " " No trouble at all , you jist dip it out , " said Ed . " You got to wash your face afterwards , " put in Jake , who was a humorist , and the row of children all giggled . They argued back and forth , Ed talking the place " up , " and Jed talking it " down , " and it was a part of the bargaining process , which both of them understood clearly . Jed said these little surface signs of oil never meant anything ; to which Ed replied suspiciously , " I thought you did n't know nothin ' about oil ? " " Everybody knows that much , " replied the other . " When you want to drill for oil , you got to go a thousand feet deep , or maybe five or six thousand , like they do out in California . These little pools on top have never been known to amount to anything . " That was not quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his suit-case ; but the suit-case was locked , and Jed meant to keep it so.  | After they had dinner , Ed asked would he like to see the oil well ; and Jed said no , but he 'd look at the ranch , if Ed wanted to sell at a price worth talking about . So Ed took him out on the ridge , from which all the country was spread out to view , and he showed where his boundaries ran , a mile this way and nearly two miles that ; he talked about his timber , and showed his " crick , " and samples of his fences , and pointed out his stock  --  he would n't sell his stock , but only the land , he was thinking to move to a place nearer the railroad , it was a mite too far for his wife , she was ailin ' some , and he thought he 'd like to have her where she could git to a doctor . Jed agreed , that was a serious matter , being so far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the land was too high , and could n't be irrigated , and was worth nothing at all . He talked dryness and bad roads , until Ed in desperation had to bring up the oil well again , and insist that Jed should see it . Jed saw it : a hole in the ground , smeared all over the sides and rim , and black as ink in the bottom . " I 'll run this here pail down and let you see , " said Ed ; but Jed said never mind , that did n't interest him , the only way you could get oil out of this country would be with a pipe-line that would cost a man a million dollars . He turned his back and looked at the mountains , and said he had a mind to stay and go hunting ; when did the deer season open ? To which Ed replied , they did n't have no seasons back here , Jed could go shoot a deer any time , and Ed would help him lug it in , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the house , and Jed said to Jake , " Well , let 's be getting on . " They got into the car , and Jed tried to pay for the dinners , but Ed said ,  |p189heck  no , they did n't run no hoardin ' - house , they was glad to see company . Then Jake started the engyne ; and Ed , with disappointment written all over his face , remarked above the clatter : " You do n't think you 'd want this place ? " " I might , " said Jed , " but you 'd want too much . " " You ai n't asked what I want . " " I know , but I can tell from the way you talk . You do n't seem to know there 's been a panic , and the bottom has dropped out of farm land . I got to find some rancher that knows it . " " What 'll you offer me for the place ? " " It ai n't up to me to offer , it 's for you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , I kind of thought I ought to git forty thou-sand . " " Oh , my God , " said Jed  --  " and without the stock or anything ? You 'd better say twenty and I 'll come back and bargain with you . Good-by . " They drove on , and looked at other places , all along that ridge , and towards evening Jake remarked that there was a couple o ' fellers lived jist ahead here , by the name of Nichols , and it might be a good place to spend the night . So Jed met " Mr. Jim Nichols " and his brother , Ranny : two eager , chatty little fellows who made Jed think of a pair of active brown squirrels . They lived alone , except for a nephew who was halfwitted . So glad they were to see company , they killed a couple of chickens for supper , and got out a comb of honey , and some thick clotted cream from a spring- house , and the half-witted nephew made hot biscuits yellow with soda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him he had left out the salt  --  his wits were not equal to remembering all the ingredients . Through supper they talked this country , the mountains , the water , the soil , the crops , the fish , the game , the storms , the roads  --  a hundred things . Before long they were talking oil . Jake said they had seen Ed Cudliff'soil well , and Jim said him and Ranny might have the same thing if they chose to dig , they had oil outcroppingsall over the place , he 'd show them in the morning , there were cracks in the ground full of it , and a little cave in the hillside all smeared with it . Ranny said you got it on your shoes ; look here  --  and he held up his foot . Jim went on : he had written to a big capitalist in Mountain City , Mr. Warrener  --  ever hear of him ? Jed admitted that he had , but it was hard to get these big fellers to bother with small matters , and ranchers never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ completelyindifferent to oil , but interested in cattle and their grazing , so the Nichols brothers talked their cattle , and the upshot was , they would sell their ranch , cattle and all , three hundred and twenty acres for fifteenthousand dollars . Jed said that was too much , but he 'd look at it in the morning . Then , when he was alone in his sleeping-room , Jed got out his oil books , and by the light of a candle studied them for three hours or more , digesting every paragraphthat bore on surface indications and geological formations in which oil-bearing sands were apt to occur . If only he had had the sense to take a course in geology at the university , so that he could recognize the differentp191kinds of rocks , and the directions of the strata ! But here he was , having to make up his mind all by himself . He knew that to bring in an oil expert might double the price of the land . Next morning he inspected the Nichols place , with the same indifference to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was a long ridge , running parallel to the main chain of the mountains , five or ten miles of it , and it was along this ridge that both Cudliff and Nichols had their oil . It was probably all one formation , and Jed pictured a great pool underneath  --  untilthe image became so vivid to him , he began to think of it as a " hunch . " If it was there , it was the fortune he had been looking for ; and surely that open oil well ought to be enough to induce some " wildcatter " to take a chance , on a royalty basis . If it turned out a " dry hole , " all right , Jed would sell the land for what he could get , and try something else . Jed told the two little brown squirrels that he feared their land was too dry to make a go of , and drove away with Jake , leaving them greatly cast down . He looked at more of the country , and suggested that they stop at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunting for deer . So there was Ed again , and said they could borrow his guns if they wanted to , but they 'd better wait and take a whole day , starting out early . Presentlyhe brought it round that they were talking land again . Had Jed seen anything that suited him ? Jed grumbled about the dry land , and how it would ruin a fellow , having to haul in feed for the winter , and thatp192was why Ed was taking out some of his stock now , was n't it ? Ed did not deny that it was so . Il e urged them to stay for dinner again , and Jed said he would if he could pay for it , and Ed said all right , if it would make him more comfortable , the missuswould git up somethin ' extra . Pretty soon Ed was saying he had thought it over and he 'd shade that price , he 'd make it thirty-five thousand , if it was to be cash , all but the ten thousand dollar bank mortgage . Jed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that much cash in America right now , except in Wall Street . Ed was worried by that statement , he kept bringing back the subject when Jed tried to change it ; the missus was anxious to move , it seemed , and would the visitor make a real offer ? Jed said it was hardly worth while , because of the exaggerated notions the other had as to the present price of farm land in the West . What was the use of a thousand acres of hill land that would feed cattle half the year and let them starve to death the other half ? So they had dinner , and as Jed and Jake were makingready to depart , Ed called the former aside and said he 'd come lower yet , would thirty-two thousand interest him ? Jed said no , he was sorry , he did n't think he 'd go a cent over twenty thousand , so no use to talk at all . Ed said he was making a great mistake , he 'd find mighty few places with such variety of land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good stuff that could be irrigated . Jed said yes , but it might as well be in the moon , what could you do with the crops ? And an oil well , too , put in the other ; but Jed said that was a joke . They were in the car , ready to start . It was one ofp193those old-fashioned Fords that you had to crank , and Jake was just stooping to take hold of the handle , when Ed said no , wait . " You got a chance to git a real bargain in land in this place , Mister  --  if you 'll jist show a little bit more comin ' on ! " " What is your lowest ? " said Jed . " Well , twenty-eight thousand . " " No , it would n't interest me a bit . Man , you should see some of the places I 've had offered  --  with land all ditched for irrigation , that you can raise alfalfa on . Go ahead , Jake . " " Jist a minute , friend . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll tell you : I have n't got time to bargain , I got another place I want to see before dark ; but I 'll say twenty-two thousand , as the absolute limit , and that 's spot cash , except for your mortgage , I 'll put a thousand dollars in to the escrow , and I 'll pay the balance the very day the bank notifies me the title is clear . " " Man , I could n't take a price like that ! Why , listen to what improvements I put on this place  --  " " I 'm not interested in things like that , because farm values are all shot to nothing , and it 's not a question of what a fellow has put in , but what he 's going to take out . Go ahead , Jake . " " Hold on ! I 'll say twenty-five thousand , and as God is my witness , man  --  " " No , I 'm not going to raise it again . I 've seen places I 'd rather have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your wife I would n't have added that extra two thousand . You advertise the place , and see what answers you get ; you 'll find you may n't get another cash offer in a year . "   " Let me have your address , friend  --  " " No , I 'm not fooling with anything like that ; I 've got a cashier 's check in my pocket for a thousand dollars , and I 'm going to buy a place before I finish this trip . " Jed was only twenty-two at this time , and he did not feel the complete assurance with which he spoke ; but he had studied this manner of mastery and practicedit for some time . His two years ' acquaintance with Carrie Meecham had made him familiar with everything having to do with real estate trading . " It 's now or never with me , " he remarked . " Go on , Jake . " The poor ranchman stood with his hands clenched ; he was white about the gills with the strain . Jake gave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sputterand roar ; he hopped into the car , and was about to back away , when Ed raised his hand , and came closer , and said : " If I take that offer , do you mean to put the deal right through ? " " I 'm a man of my word , " said Jed . " You can step into this car , and we 'll drive down to the nearest bank , and if you can find the escrow officer , I 'll put the deal through to-night . " The rancher stood within three feet of the car . From the expression on his face , you 'd have thought it was a question of selling his brood of children , and perhaps the " missus " as well . Suddenly he swallowed a lump of air , and then another , and said : " All right , friend , the place is yours ! "  |p195JED  RUSHER went back to Mountain City , and told his sister what he had done , and the look on her face matched that of Ed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ed had been scared , she need n't be , because his loss was her gain . " I 've got a fine property , Liza , " he assured her . " All I have to pay is eleven thousand more ; the ten thousand mortgage is n't due for a year . My job now is to get some oil men to look at it . " " Are you going to let Mr. Warrener in on the deal ? " " Why should I ? I did the job he sent me for , and I 'll report to him on that , and he can send an expert up to see the Nichols property if he wants to . " " But the expert will hear that you have bought a place . " " What do I care ? It 's no crime to buy land . " " But how will you say you got the money ? " " I took my savings and yours , and I borrowed some more , and made a down payment  --  taking a chance that f could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't interfere with any of Mr. Warrener 's rights . " " You do n't want to lose his favor , Jed ! " " Not if I can help it . But I 'm not going to work for him much longer  --  you can bet that if I put this deal through , I 'll not spend half my day sitting with an invalid at four dollars a sit ! " Jed 's first question on entering the house had been , had the money come from New York . It had not ; and Liza began right away to worry about that . How soon did Jed have to pay the rest of the money on the land ? He had thirty days , he said . But suppose the money from New York took longer than that ? Liza kept insisting , until Jed proposed to send a telegram and find out . It would be all right to telegraph now , not mentioning the name of Mrs. Evarts ; the name of Jed Rusher would mean nothing to any telegraph clerk . Liza assented , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ later came a knockout blow . The American Jewelers ' Protective Association informed Jed Rusher that the payment was never made in less than six months ! " There 's government for you ! " cried Jed in a fury . " Six months to sign a check , which a private corporationwould put through in a day ! Twenty-five different swivel-chair politicians have to O.K. it , and each one keeps it on his desk a week ! " Jed had heard Mr. WalterEvarts say something like that , and had been impressed . Liza was haggard with anxiety ; but her brother reboundedquickly . It is the business of a man to learn to take blows . " Cheer up , Liza ! The worst that can possibly happen is that I lose my oil ranch . " " And our thousand dollars , Jed ! " " I 've got eighteen thousand coming , so I can stand it . But believe me , I 'm not going to lose that ranch ! What worries me is , I 'll have to take somebody in on the deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it over for a while , then said , " Perhaps the best thing will be to tell Mr. Warrener , and get him to back me . He 'd probably give me easier terms than any one else . I 'll take a day to figure over it  --  he does n't know I 'm back , you know , and if I do n't make myself conspicuous , he has no way to find out . " So there was Jed Rusher pacing back and forth in his attic bedroom , like a tiger in a cage ; thinking of every one he had ever known or heard of who might have eleven thousand dollars , and might possibly be separated from it . Mr. Crumback , the banker in Zion , and Mr. Hinks , the cattleman at Alainito ; Carrie Meechan and her Miss Hugins , and the hardware dealer whose cousin was one of the boarders ; a publisherfor whom Dick Sunstorm had sold books  --  Jed thought of all these , and even of old Chancellor Saybuck , who no doubt had part of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertisement , such as he had seen in the newspapers while searching for a job ; it would go in the classification of " Business Opportunities , " and Jed 's quick mind was devising the phrases : " I have a deal which calls for eleven thousand . If you have it , can show you biggest opportunity of life . Solid proposition . No cheap skates . Box 142X , Mail ' Of-fice . " Lunch-time came , and Liza considered it her sisterly duty to send the maid up to call Jed ; and incidentally to bring him a letter which had just come in the mail . He said " All right , " to the maid , and took the letter , which was written on expensive stationery in a woman 's hand which he did not know . It was marked " Per- sonal , " and had been sent to Mr. Warrener 's office in the Fourth National Bank Building , where the faithfulJermin had forwarded it to the boarding-house . Jed tore it open , and read : " DEAR MR . RUSHER @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was in trouble , and so this is to tell you that I am having a dreadful time . I had to tell Mamma , and she is so angry , I never saw anything so awful . She will not let me leave my room , or see any one , so please come if you can , because I am so unhappy , I do n't know what to think or do . " Yours sincerely , " LULU BELLE MACY . " So there was something new , and Jed did not go down to the lunch table of the boarding-house ! It was a situation to which he had been looking forwardfor three months , and he was like the efficient general staff of an army , which has worked out every detail of its plans for every possible war which can arise , and at the last moment has nothing to do except to turn to a filing-cabinet , and take out portfolio 171-198 . Jed mentally folded up the papers marked " oil ranch , " and put them away , and took out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle and Mrs. Jane . " He put on his hat , and went out , and took a street-car which would carry him to the Macy mansion . No hesitation this time , no pacing up and down , but that promptness of execution which is provided for in the plans of all general staffs . Jed ascended the steps of the pretentious mansion , built of yellow brick withp199marble trimmings , and rang the electric bell . To the butler he said , " I wish to see Mrs. Macy . Tell her it is Mr. Rusher , from her father 's home . " No questioning of that ! " Have a seat , sir , " said the man , and took himself off ; and Jed sat down , in an entrance-hall which went up two stories , and had a balcony running round three sides , most impressive . But Jed was not thinking about architecture now ; he was talking to himself , to suppress the tendency of his hands and knees to tremble . Steady now ! This is the great test , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power ! Mrs. Macy appeared suddenly from a doorway , clad in a pale blue house-dress . As she approached her caller , he saw that something had played havoc with her carefully nurtured charms ; there were dark shadowsto be seen on her fair blonde face . But her manner was calm ; if there was distress in the family , it was not to be revealed to this employee . " Yes , Mr. Rusher ? " she said , in a tone which took it for granted that he had some family errand , without which he would not have presumed to appear here . Jed came to the point at once . " Mrs. Macy , I am calling on account of your daughter . " " My daughter ? " A sudden arctic change in the great lady 's tone . " What do you mean ? " " I think , " said Jed , " it is desirable that we should talk where there is no chance of being overheard . " For one moment there was terror in the woman 's face . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come , " and led him into a reception room off the main entrance hall , and closed the door behind them.  | Now , Jed , keep your nerve ; and Mrs. Jane , do no less ! For here begins a duel of wills , with the destiny of several lives depending upon it . Jed looks , and sees a lady who bears some resemblance to an angry lioness , standing with her back to the door , as if to imprison and shut in whatever dangerous words he may be planning to say . Once she was a beauty , like her daughter , but now the gold has faded in her hair , and the blue in her eyes , and her complexion no longer stands the daylight . She has a tendency to plumpness , and the flesh is beginning to hang from cheeks and chin ; but still she is a lady , accustomed to being obeyed , and her voice reveals indignation at this young man 's presumption . " What do you mean , Mr. Rusher ? " " Mrs. Macy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telling me that she is in trouble , and asking me to see her . " " Oh ! So my daughter appeals to you ! " Suddenly the pale blue eyes opened to a wide stare , and the woman clenched her hands and exclaimed : " So you are the man ! " That move had been anticipated by the efficient general staff , and was fully covered in the plans worked out . " Mrs. Macy , I can see nothing to be gained by our discussing that question . " " So ! You do not deny that you are the seducer of my innocent child ! Wretch ! Serpent ! " It might have been an old-style melodrama . The stately matron lost suddenly every trace of that self-possession which was her stock-in-trade . Her clenched hands were quiver/ing , and she started towards Jed Rusher as if she would seize him by the throat . " Control yourself , madam , " said Jed , with dignity which was truly splendid  --  he had rehearsed it at least a score of times . " You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say again , there is nothing to be gained by discussing that question . I have come here to see Lulu Belle . " " Indeed ! You imagine I will permit you to see her ? " " I know that you will , when you understand my pur-pose . " " What do you mean ? " " In the first place , let me make clear  --  I know what measures you contemplate in this trouble . " " Oh , you do ! May I ask how you know ? " " You may ask , but I shall not answer . I simply conveyto you the fact that I know , and that I do n't intend to permit it to happen . " " And what makes you imagine you can give orders to me in my home ? " " I have the right of every citizen , Mrs. Macy  --  to prevent a crime . It is a crime against the laws both of God and man which you are planning , and I assure you , I do not intend to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plans of the general staff it had been set forth that at this stage of the campaign it would not be definitelyknown that Lulu Belle 's Mamma was planning a crime against the laws both of God and man ; but almostcertainly she would be planning it , and the way to ascertain would be to make the charge and watch her face . Jed now saw his victim quail and turn white ,  | and knew that he had scored a hit , and should follow up that line of attack . " Mrs. Macy , let me make clear to you my purpose , without any delay or beating about the bush . Lulu Belle is going to have her baby . " " Oh ! Monster ! " " She is going to have her baby , as she wants to do , and as it is her legal and moral right to do , and nobody is going to take it away from her . I am going to see her , and explain to her what her rights are , and the crime she will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Is that clear ? " The woman was glaring at Jed with such concentratedfury that he really wondered if she was going to strike him . But no ; suddenly she stepped to one side and opened the door . " Mr. Rusher , be so good as to leave my house at once ! " Jed took from his breast pocket a little notebook and opened it . " You had better close the door again , Mrs. Macy . I am going to read to you a passage from the Compiled Laws of this State , Session Laws of 1891 , page 122 , Section 1 . " Jed began to read , in a grave and solemn voice : " And every person who shall administer , or cause to be administered or taken , any such poison , substance , or liquid , or who shall use , or cause to be used , any instrument of whatever kind , with the intention to procure the miscarriage of any woman then being with child  --  " Jed stopped for just the fraction of a second , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then he resumed his slow , measured reading : "  --  and shall thereof be duly convicted , shall be imprisonedfor a term not exceeding three years in thep203penitentiary and fined in a sum not exceeding one thousand dollars ; and if any woman by reason of such treatment shall die , the person or persons administering or causing to be administered such poison , substance or liquid , or using or causing to be used any instrument as aforesaid , shall be deemed guilty of murder , and if convicted , to be punished accordingly , unless it appears that such miscarriage was procured or attempted by or under advice of a physician or surgeon with intentto save the life of such woman or to prevent serious and permanent bodily injury to her . " " Now , Mrs. Macy , " said Jed , " there can be no questionof any such danger in the case of Lulu Belle  --  " " The child is barely fifteen years old ! " cried the frantic mother . " Girls of that age are bearing children every day in this state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fit than your daughter . " " Concerning that , Mr. Rusher , the law appoints the surgeon or the doctor , and not you , as the judge . " " The law will not leave it to a surgeon or doctor whom you have hired , Mrs. Macy . And anyhow , that has nothing to do with my purpose , which is to inform Lulu Belle as to her rights , and to read this law to her . " " You are not going to see my daughter , young man ; so let me have no more such insolence ! " " Is that your final decision ? " " It is . " " All right , Madam . I notice that you have a telephone on the table , and I take the liberty of using it . " He stepped to the phone , while the woman stood , taken aback by his move . He took the receiver , and called , " Argyle 5000 , " and waited.  | " What are you going to do ? " Jed made no reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mopntain City Mail , ' " and he said , " I wish to speak to Mr. T. J. Goodson . " Mrs. Jane Macy emitted an anguished cry , and sprang in front of Jed , with her two hands clasped together , twisting them in her distress . " No ! No ! " To the members of Mountain City 's world of wealth and fashion , the name Jed had pronounced was precisely the most horrible of all names in the world ; that of Satan was nothing in comparison . " No ! No ! No ! " said Mrs. Jane , over and over again , in what might be described as a whispered scream . " No ! No ! No ! " " Hello , T. J. , " said Jed , suddenly . " This is your friend Jed  --  " At which instant Lulu Belle 's Mamma made a leap , and grabbed the phone and tore it from his hands and clapped the palm of her hand over the mouthpiece . " No ! No ! You may have your way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back from the phone , and Mrs. Macy hung up the receiver , and then sank into a chair , half swooning . " Oh , monster ! " he heard her whisper , but he did n't mind that , for every great man has to be called bad names . He stood waiting , until she had recovered at least part of her self-possession . Meantime , he was smiling at the thought of the publisher of the Mountain City " Mail " at the other end of that wire , wondering what had happened , and who was his mysterious " friend Jed . " Needless to say , Jed Rusher had never met the great ogre of Mountain City , but had simply been " bluffing , " according to the campaign plan of his highly efficient general staff.  | How had Jed got all that information , which had enabled him to play the role of protecting angel to Lulu Belle , and emissary of Beelzebub to Lulu Belle 's Mamma ? Jed had had three months in which to preparethis series of events , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out almost anything . He had gone to his friend Dick Sunstorm , who , having knocked about the world for several summers as bookagentand high-class peddler , was not inexperienced in the arts of gallantry , and possessed the necessary knowledge for playing the " woman game . " Jed had begun sounding him out on the subject of girls " in trouble , " and the efficient salesman had been gleeful , taking it for granted that Jed , the pious Methodist , had been " cutting up " like other college youths . In vain did Jed assure him that it was n't for himself that he wanted to know , but for a friend . However , Dick had given him most of the informationhe needed . As for the legal quotation which had produced such a profound effect upon poor Mrs. Macy , it had been got by the simple device of asking the omniscient lady at the library desk for a book containing the laws of the state , and then looking up the word " abortion " in the index . So easy it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years of high school and two of college to put you onto the tricks ! Mrs. Jane summoned the butler , and told him to send Lulu Belle to her . When she appeared , the mother said , " Mr. Rusher wants to talk to you "  --  and then she seated herself in a chair , prepared to supervise the interview ! It was necessary for Jed to say , politely but firmly , " You will excuse me , Mrs. Macy ; I must talk to Lulu Belle alone , and I must have your assurance that our talk will not be interrupted or overheard . " The great lady took a deep breath , and an explosion seemed imminent ; but she saw the " monster " turn his eyes towards the telephone again , and without a word she swept herself from the room . Poor Lulu Belle ! She had grown up all of a sudden , it appeared . There were tragic lines down the sides of her mouth ; the color had gone out of her cheeks and into her eyelids . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jed , sympathetically . " Oh , Mr. Rusher , " she burst out , " you ca n't imagine it ! Mamma has said the most awful things ! She called me names  --  I do n't even know what they mean , but she says I 'm depraved , and no decent person will ever speak to me ; I 've ruined the family , shamed her before the whole world . Why is it , Mr. Rusher  --  if it is so awful , what I did , why did she never warn me ? Why would n't she tell me , when I asked about babies ? Could n't she have told me what people do when they get married , and that you must n't do it before you get married ? How was I to know ? " " She ought to have told you , Lulu Belle . If I had imagined that she would n't , I 'd surely have told you myself . " " Oh , if you only had been kind enough ! " " The first time you spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The second time it was too late . Of course , I might have warned you how angry your Mamma was going to be ; but I knew it would make you unhappy , and what was the use , when maybe you were n't going to have a baby at all ? "  | " I never would have believed my mother could say such words to me ! I have n't done a thing but cry ever since  --  " She started to prove it ; and Jed , who had an aversion to female tears , said quickly : " The thing we have to do now is to decide about the future . What does your mother say ? " " She says I do n't have to have the baby , she can take me to a doctor , and he 'll fix it so it wo n't happen . " " I knew she 'd say that , Lulu Belle ; that is why I came the moment I got your letter . I must tell you , that is one of the most wicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it happen to you . It is really a human life you have in you , and when the doctor does what your mother wants , he is committing murder , and so is your mother when she pays him to do it . " Once more Jed pulled out his notebook , and read to the frightened child the grim phrases of the law . " Oh , Mr. Rusher ! Mamma ca n't know about that ! " " She does know , Lulu Belle , because I read it to her just now . It was n't anything new to her , she made that plain . " " You mean she would be willing to do something she knew was so wrong ? " " I mean this : your mother is frantic , and not responsiblefor what she is saying . She would take any risk , to avoid the disgrace of letting you have a baby before you are married . You 'll simply have to realize that you ca n't count on her in this trouble ; you 'll have to think for yourself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't be that way ! " " I 'm afraid he 'll be exactly the same , Lulu Belle . Where is he ? "  | " He was in Chicago , and Mamma telegraphed for him ; she says he 'll be here to-night . " " I do n't want to frighten you , " said Jed , " but you must expect to find him even angrier than your mother . Ile will try his best to make you go to a doctor , and have this dreadful thing done to you . It is called an abortion , and it 's a wicked , wicked thing . " Poor Lulu Belle ! The few traces of color went out of her cheeks , and her eyes became wells of tears . " Mr. Rusher , what am I going to do ? " " Make up your mind that your future is at stake , and you have to look out for yourself . You have a right to have your baby , and you must do it , no matter what anybody else says . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might die of blood-poisoning , and then your mother and father would be murderers , and they would carry the guilt of it all their lives . Again , an accident might happen , you might be fixed so that you could never have a baby again as long as you live . So you would never be happy , and your husband would never be happy , if you should marry ; your life would be spoiled . " She was staring at him , wide-eyed . " I ca n't believe that my mother and father would do such things to me ! " " They would do anything in the world , Lulu Belle , rather than have this disgrace . " Sitting by a center table , she bowed her head upon it and burst into sobbing . " Oh , what is to become of me ? " " The first thing you must do , is to make up your mind that you are going to have that baby . Do n't let them say anything to dissuade you , and above all , don'tp209let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ physical force upon you . " " But Mamma said I was a vile creature , and she would n't have me in the house . What would I do if she turned me out ? " Jed got up from his seat , and went to the door of the room , and opened it and looked out . Then he closed it again , and came back to the child . What he had said so far he had said already to Lulu Belle 's Mamma ; but now he had something that was for Lulu Belle alone . He drew his chair close , and began in a low voice : " Listen , Lulu Belle , there is one way out of your trouble , and I 'll explain it to you . Stop crying , please . " She was ashamed of her tears ; instinct no doubt told her they were not pretty . She turned her head aside and wiped them away with her handkerchief , and then gazed at the nice Mr. Rusher with those big , wide blue eyes . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ since you told me what you had done . I knew you were going to be in a fix , and find your parents cruel and mean . So do n't think this is a sudden notion , it 's something I 've been thinking over from every point of view . The way out of your trouble is for you and me to get married . " Lulu Belle 's mouth came open , as well as her eyes , and she caught hold of the arms of the chair . " You and I ? Get married ! Why , what an idea ! " " Just see how it will be . You will have a husband , so right away it will be natural for you to have a baby.  | Nobody will be disgraced , and nobody will have any cause to be angry . Instead of turning you out of the house , they 'll send you nice presents , the way they did with your Cousin Marian when she had her baby . " " But then , why does n't Mamma think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody who would marry you . She would think you were disgraced by what you had done , and no good man would be willing to marry you . But I know how it is , Lulu Belle , I know you are n't bad at all , as your Mamma thinks  --  it was just because you were ignorant , and did n't know what you were doing . So I would be willing to marry you . " These were the first kind words Lulu Belle had heard in the past two days , and a light began to dawn in her face . " You would do that just to help me in my trouble ? " " No , not entirely . Because I know that when this is all over , you 'll be happy again , and you 'll learn to love me , and make me a good wife . " " It 's very good of you , Mr. Rusher , and I 'm ever so grateful ; but you see how it is  --  it frightens me , because I never dreamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at all ! " " Of course , Lulu Belle , but the trouble is , you 're going to find that you hardly know anybody any more . All your relatives and your friends , when they hear about the baby , will behave exactly like your mother , and you 'll be left all by yourself . " Again the tears started . " Oh , I do n't know what to make of all this ! It seems as if the whole world had gone crazy . " " I tell you , my dear , " said Jed , gently ; " the bestp211thing to do is to let them be crazy for a while , and get away from them . I do n't know any other solution but the one I tell you . I 'll say that the baby is mine  --  that I 'm the father of it  --  and nobody 'll ever know the difference . Your mother already believes that . " " How do you mean ? " " When I came here to see you , she naturally assumed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby ; else why should I have anything to do with you ? Other men would say you were a bad girl , and not come near you . She charged me with that , and I did n't say yes or no  --  because I meant to ask you to marry me , and if you do , we 'll simply let her go on thinking what she does . It 'll be better , because  --  here is something else you may not understand  --  people would n't think it was right , if they knew I was taking care of another man 's child . They 'd think it was a disgrace , and they 'd laugh at me . " " Then you 'd really be making a sacrifice for my sake , Mr. Rusher ! " " It would be , if the truth were known ; but how can it be ? That boy will keep the secret , wo n't he ? " " Oh , yes , I know he will ! He 's really a nice boy ! " " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one other , your Grandpa . I would go right away and tell him the truth ; because , you see how it is , he employedme and trusted me  --  it was at his home that I met you , and if I were to run away with you and marry you without your mother 's consent , he would think it was dishonorable , unless he knew the real reason . " " You think he would n't say I was a wicked girl ? " " He is a wise and kind old gentleman , and he 'll believe you when you tell him how it happened . "  | " Mamma would n't believe me , Mr. Rusher ! At least , she said she did , after a while , but I ca n't be sure if she does in her heart . I ca n't make out what it is she thinks about me , or what there is so wicked about it . " All that will be over the moment we get married , Lulu Belle ; it 'll be like a bad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be happy again . " " But then , why do we have to run away ? Why not tell her ? " " We 'll tell her as soon as it 's over . You see , besides the baby , there 's another matter  --  your mother thinks I 'm a poor man ; she has seen me working for your Grandpa , and she 'd think I would n't be able to take care of you . But that has all changed in the past few days  --  my sister and I inherited some money , and I 've just been up into the country and bought a big ranch  --  a thousand acres  --  and there 's oil on it , and very soon I 'm going to be a rich man , even richer than your Papa , perhaps . So I 'll be able to take good care of you , and there 'll be nothing for them to worry about . " " Why not tell her that ? " " She would n't believe me , Lulu Belle . She 'd say I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandpa 's , maybe . No , this is your affair ; I am telling you the truth , just as you told me , and you have to make up your mind if you 're willing to trust me . " She sat with the big , candid blue eyes fixed upon his face . " Would you really be good to me , Mr. Rusher ? You would n't despise me because I had been bad ? " " No , I would n't , because I know you . I thought all that over a long time . If I did n't know how it happened , I would n't be willing to tie my life to yours . Ip213do n't have to marry a girl just because her parents are rich  --  I assure you I can make my own way in the world , and I 'd have no trouble finding a wife , and have my own baby . " " What would we do , Mr. Rusher ? I could n't go on staying here if I was married , could I ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Belle . I 've got the loveliest ranch you ever laid eyes on  --  it 's high up , near the mountains , and there are beautiful views , and places to ride , and hunting and fishing . And a nice house  --  we 'd keep rabbits and chickens , and dogs if you like them , and horses . I thought about you when I bought it  --  because , you see , I 've had you in the back of my mind ever since you told me the situation , and I knew what was probably coming . We can live there , and you have your baby  --  of course , you 'll have to go to a city while it 's born , to be near a doctor , but then you can come back , and we 'll stay there if you like it , or go somewhere else . I 'm going to drill for oil on that ranch , and make a lot of money , but there 's plenty of room in a thousand acres , and it would n't be spoiled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fascinated . Such a strange idea , to get married and have a husband ! Jed saw her appraising him with new eyes ; he could imagine the procession of ideas going through her mind . Did she realize now what marriage meant ? No doubt ; but he would go on talking about ranches , and pets , and babies , and oil , and other safe and entertaining subjects ! " I do n't know , " she said , at last , " it 's such a queer idea ! I would n't have a governess any more , or go to school , as Papa was talking about ! " Jed smiled , pityingly . " Dear child , you do n't realize the situation . You ca n't go to school or have a governessanyhow . " " You mean  --  on account of the baby ? " " Of course ; they would n't let you into any school ; it ca n't be kept secret , because it 'll show in your body , and they 'd turn you out as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her name ?  --  Miss Partington  --  shewould run away in horror if she got a hint of such a thing . " Again Lulu Belle 's eyes began to fill with tears . " Mamma has sent her away already ; she told her I was to be sent to school . " " You see , my dear  --  it 's all just as I say ! I suppose she 's keeping it hidden from the servants . " " She 's in terror about their guessing it . " " But they 're bound to know there 's something wrong , seeing you not going out . Pretty soon you 'll have scandals starting , and people trying to blackmail your mother  --  that is , making her pay money to keep the secret . There 's a wicked man who publishes a newspaper in this town , and servants bring him secrets like that , and people have to pay him huge sums of money to keep him from publishing their disgrace . That is what your Mamma 's so afraid of . " Lulu Belle sat staring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned into one gigantic nightmare ; but here was this wise , all-understanding Mr. Rusher , the one sane person , the one friend who held out a hand . " You 're sure that if I were  --  if you were to marry me , all this would be over ? " " Certainly , my dear . See for yourself ! You 'll have a husband , and that makes all the difference there is . If you have a husband , it 's respectable to have babies ,  |p215as  many as you want . It wo n't have to be a secret , and nobody can be angry with you . " At which Lulu Belle clenched her hands , and started suddenly from her chair . " All right ! " she whispered . " Let 's go ! "  |p216JED  betook himself to the office of the County Clerk , and said , " I want to get married . " A license blank was handed to him : " Know all men by this certificate , that any regularly ordained minister of the Gospel authorizedby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christians , Hebrews , or religious body of which he may be a member , or any judge or justice of the peace to whom this may come , he not knowing of any lawful impediment thereto , is hereby authorized and empowered to solemnize the rites of matrimony between Jed Rusher , of Mountain City , and Lulu Belle Macy , of Mountain City , " etc. , etc . There were a lot of blanks to be filled in , " Previously married . . . divorced . . . " and so on , but nothing about the age of the parties , or parents ' consent . Jed thought he was going to get by that part ; but when the clerk came to sign , he said , " How old are you ? " and then , " How old is the lady ? " Jed answered to the first question , " Twenty-two , " and to the second , " Nineteen . " Said the clerk , " Since I do n't know you or the lady , I have to ask you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He made out the form , and Jed took the oath , but not without some inner quaking . He had seen and heard so much of blackmailing , thatp217he had made up his mind never to break any law without a good lawyer 's advice . Now he walked down the street , knowing that he had committed an act of perjury , and very uneasy about it . Better take no chances ! he went into one of the big office buildings , and took the elevator to the top floor , and wandered up and clown the corridors , seekinga lawyer 's sign which looked sufficiently inexpensive . At last he went in on chance , and found himself confronting a slender , dark young man of thoughtful but smiling features . " I am a working student at the university , " Jed began , " and I want to marry a girl , and need some advice from a lawyer who wo n't charge me too much . " Said the other , gravely : " I 'll charge you five dollars , and make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Well , we ought to get married , you understand , but the girl is under age , and I do n't think her parents would favor me , because I 'm earning my living . I went to the County Clerk and he asked me her age , and I said nineteen , and then he made me swear to it , and of course that worried me , and I thought I ought to find out how much trouble that might get a fellow into . " Jed had grown rather red while he made this speech , and now he stood , with a return of his old ranch manners , holding his straw hat in his hands and not knowing just what to do with it . In an inner doorway stood the young lawyer 's partner , an Englishman with a round and rosy face , and not much hair on top . " Young man , " said he , " you 've come to the state 's most eminent authority on the subject of our marriage laws . He has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the story , " said the other lawyer . " A young fellow off a ranch was nineteen , but his parents would n't let him marry , so he swore he was twenty-one , and got married , and then his parents had him prosecutedfor perjury . I defended him , and this is what I pleaded : Our law does not specify that to be competent to marry , the man must be twenty-one and the woman eighteen ; all it does is to impose a fine on a minister who knowingly marries a minor without the parents ' consent . Since the law does not specify the ages , the common law stands , which is twelve for the girl and fourteen for the man . So the clerk had no legal right to ask whether my client was of age , and since it is not perjury to answer falsely an immaterial question , the case should be dismissed . The court sustained my objection , and there you are . " " Thank you , " said Jed ; " then I do n't really have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I 'll get you off by the same trick . But unless you can fool the preacher who marriesyou , he might have to pay a hundred dollars fine . " " Thanks again , " said Jed . " I 'll do my best to fool him . " He took out his purse , but the lawyer laughed , and said , " That 's all right , give it to the bride with my compliments . " So Jed thanked him again , and also thanked the Englishman with the round rosy face and the bald head . As he went to the elevator , he was thinking to himself : " What a lot of tricks in the law , and how you have to watch out ! " Also he was think-P219ing : " Those are nice fellows , but when I get a lawyer , I want somebody that 's mean . " Jed went to the nearest telephone-booth , and called the home of the Reverend Alonzo Timothy Glaub , the young assistant at the Salvation Methodist Church of Mountain City , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The young preacher had been a boarder of Liza 's when he first came to his charge , and now he lived in a cottage with his old mother for company . Nobody could be more good or respectable , and Jed was fully resolved to see to it that he should not be fined a hundred dollars . " Is the Reverend Glaub in ? " he asked , and then , a minute later : " Reverend Glaub , this is Jed Rusher . How do you do ? How is your Ma ? I 'm glad to hear that . Yes , we 're all fine at the boarding-house . ReverendGlaub , I want to tell you I 'm going to get married . Yes , yes , thank you . She 's a granddaughter of my employer , and a very nice young lady . Yes , I was wondering if you would perform the ceremony ? Thank you , that 's very kind . My sister will come along , of course . It is to be right away , that is , as soon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put you to that trouble , we 'll come over to your home , if it 's agreeable to you . Yes , thank you so much , yes . I have the license . My sister will be one of the witnesses , and your mother can be the other , i f she do n't mind . Thank you , that 's kind of you . We 'll be there soon . Yes , thank you again . Good-by . " Next he called Liza , who at this hour of the after- noon was generally in the kitchen , seeing that the cook got the roast and the vegetables prepared and started cooking . " Liza , " he said , " do n't be too much shocked , please , by this news : I am going to marry Lulu Belle , Mr. Warrener 's granddaughter . Yes , Liza , it 's all arranged . The reason was , I did n't know if she 'd have me . Yes , of course , she 's a good girl , none better  --  you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married by Reverend Glaub , at his home , right away , and I want you to come there as quick as you can . Yes , of course , I would n't think of having it without you , but I want you to be quick , please  --  just run upstairs and slip on your best dress , and I 'll send a taxicab to the house for you , and give the man the address . It 's in the book , in case anything goes wrong . Yes , I 've phoned Reverend Glaub , and I 've got the license . That 's the trouble , I do n't think her parents would consent , they 're awful snobs , you know , but they 'll have to make the best of it when it 's over . That 's one reason you must n't fail to be there  --  and do n't let Reverend Glaub know it 's so sudden , just be natural and matter-of-fact about it ; plenty of people get married all the time . And please , Liza , be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , and this will make a deep impression on her , and I do want her to like you all her life , so make it clear to her that you are kind , and welcome her as your sister-in-law . No , you do n't have to worry , I 'm no fool , and I know what I 'm getting ; I 've been thinking about this for three or four months . Yes , I told you , of course , she 's all right ; she goes to the Episcopal church , and has an Episcopal governess . If anything is said about her age , please just leave thatP221to me , do n't you worry , I 've been to see two good lawyers about it , and I know exactly what I 'm doing . I ca n't stop to talk now , and do n't you stop for too much fixing  --  the cab will be at the door . " After which Jed went out on the street , and hailed a taxicab  --  he was moving up in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ member of the privileged classes . He instructed the driver to proceed to the boarding-house , and take a lady to the Reverend Glaub 's address . It was important , he said , and gave the man half a dollar , to make sure he did not fail ; incidentally he took the license number of the cal ) , to make sure the man did not run off with the half dollar . Then he stopped a second cab , and instructed the driver to take him to the fashionable suburb where Mr. Wallace J. Macy had his subdivision , with his Italian Renaissance mansion of yellow brick with marble trimmings . Another young Lochinvar had come out of the West , and the fact that it was the Rocky Mountains , instead of the highlands of Scotland , made no difference in his feelings ; neither did the fact that he was carried by thirty horse-power instead of one . Jed 's heart was thumping so hard that it hurt . The critical moment was at hand , and if he got away with this , his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excess of " nerves , " but ordinary common sense that caused him to imagine every difficulty that might arise . Suppose Lulu Belle had been physically locked up ? Suppose her mother should see her trying to slip out of the house , and should seize her ? Suppose there should happen to be a policeman passing ? Suppose that Wallace J. Macy , Real Estate and Insurance , should get hack from Chicago by an earlier train , and be arriving at the door of his home ? Jed had met him once in Mr. Warrener 's room  --  a hearty blond gentleman with bristly hair cut short , enjoying the best of health and great decisiveness of manner ; he would be a person far less easily frightenedthan his wife . The program which Jed had laid out for Lulu Belle was of the simplest . She was to say to her mother that she felt ill , and would go to her room and lie down , and not discuss what the visitor had said . Lulu Belle 's room was in the front of the house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and when she saw a taxicab standing on the other side of the street , she was to slip downstairs and out by the front door . She had sworn to Jed that she would do this , even if she had to break away by force . He had adjured her not to let herself be restrained , for her whole future depended upon it ; at the last extreme , she must run to a window and call to him , for he would know a way to persuade her mother ! The cab arrived at the appointed spot , and Jed said to the driver , " Wait here , I expect a young lady . Leave your engine running . " Since the driver looked like the right sort , and since all the world , except the relatives , sympathizes with young Lochinvar , Jed added , " We 're going to get married , and if you get us away good and quick , I 'll give you an extra dollar . " Said the driver , " Must be some dame that comes out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiringly , and the young Lochinvar tasted the first of those thrills which were to be his , as member of the Macy-Warrener clans . P223The engine of the cab was running fast , but Jed 's inner engine was beating it . Never would he have supposed that a human heart could thump on human ribs in such fashion , or that it could be made to kick and buck and stop and leap again by mere thoughts in a human head  --  images of wrestling matches between a fashionable society matron and her daughter , images of policemen strolling down the street , of fathers arrivingsuddenly from Chicago . But nothing of that melodramatic sort happened . The front door of the Italian Renaissance mansion opened suddenly , and there came the " dame " across the wide lawn , with all the speed of two long unincumbered legs . Thank Providence for that new fashion in skirts , which made it no longer possible to tell flappers from their grandmothers ! Jed threw the door open and slid out of the way , and in came a gasping whirlwind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then , to the driver , " Step on it ! " He reached over and slammed the door , and the engine gave a rush and away they wentShe is won ! We are gone , over bank , bush and scaur ; They 'll have fleet steeds that follow , quoth young Lochinvar ! They came to the home of the preacher , and Jed paid the taxi-driver , and remarked , " We 'll be traveling on pretty soon , if you want to wait . " Tie gave Lulu Belle his hand to help her from the cab , and took her under the arm to support her if she was weakening , and in they went together . There were the preacher and his mother , and Liza in her best dress , with hair to which she had put the finishing touches in a speeding taxi . For several minutes she had been sitting in the young minister 's parlor , quaking inwardly , but keeping up a good front . Yes , she had known of her brother 's engagement for some time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her parents were rich , but Liza would not hold that against them , since they were good people . They were Episcopalians , unfortunately , but she hoped the bride would attend her husband 's church . Poor Liza , she had hitched her ranch-wagon to a star , and now was whirling through space so fast that she could not see the landscape , nor do anything but hold on tight ! There was handshaking all round , and Liza did exactlywhat Jed had ordered  --  wise Liza !  --  she kissed the frightened Lulu Belle on both cheeks , at the same time thinking with horror : " Why , she 's nothing but a child ! Can Jed dare to run off with such a young thing ? " P , ut Jed offered no explanations . To the sun-andwind-tannedyoung preacher  --  just off a ranch , like Jed himself  --  he said , " Here is the license , Reverend Glaub . This authorizes you to perform the ceremony . " The other took it , and studied it carefully ; then obviouslyill at ease , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How old is the bride , Mr. Rusher ? " " Nineteen , " said Jed without a quaver . " She  --  er  --  that is , she does n't look  --  er  --  " " I know , Reverend Glaub , she looks young , but she is nineteen . Are n't you , Lulu Belle ? " " Yes , sir , " said Lulu Belle  --  having been told to say that , and not a word more , excepting for " How-doyou-do , " and maybe " Thank you . " P225Said Jed , the man of action : " At the office of the County Clerk I made affidavit that she is legally competentto marry , and so that relieves you of all responsibility , Reverend Glatt ! ) . This license is your authority , and you do n't have to go back of that . " " No  --  I suppose not , " said the young man . Evidentlyhe had not studied the law so thoroughly as his visitor . " I suppose it 's all right , but what about her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point came an unexpected stroke of Providence . It was the voice of Liza , firm and decisive : " Reverend Glaub , I am sure the young lady is nineteen . " " Oh ! " said the other , much relieved . " That 's all right then . " And without more ado he proceeded to pronouncethe magic questions , and Jed and Lulu Belle gave the proper answers , and they were declared man and wife . Jed got his first kiss then , and it was hard to say whether he or his bride were the more frightened . Liza did the handsome thing ; there was something wrong , her instinct told her , but it was Jed and Jed 's own against all the world for Liza , and so she offered Lulu Belle the hospitality of the boarding-house . But Jed said no , they were going away , only first they must see the bride 's grandfather , Mr. Warrener . It was interesting to note the astonishment of the young preacher at this , for he had failed to realize the social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jed asked to use the phone , and he called the Macy home , and asked for Lulu Belle 's mother . In quiet and measured tones he spoke as follows : " Mrs. Macy , this is Jed Rusher . I want to let you know that Lulu Belle and I are married . Yes , married .   We are at the home of the minister who performed the ceremony . I want you to know that Lulu Belle is all right . Of course you will want to attend to giving the news to the papers , so let me explain that the minister is a good friend of mine , and I am going to ask him not to deny anything you care to say . If you want to say that you were present at the ceremony , and that Mr. Macy was present , that will be all right , and no one will ever know the difference . Lulu Belle and I are going away on a trip . We shall call you again before we leave ; this is just to advise you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister is the Reverend Glaub  --  G-L-A-U-B . Good-by , Mrs. Macy . " Then to the breathless preacher and his mother Jed explained : " Lulu Belle is the daughter of Mr. Wallace J. Macy , and i f the parents want to say that they attended the ceremony , do n't deny it , please . It wo n't do any harm , and you wo n't have to say anything that is n't so . If anybody asks you , just say that you married us to-day , and that all information concerning the event will be given out by the bride 's parents . Say nothing more . " " Oh , certainly , certainly ! " said the pair , in chorus ; and Liza stood amazed at the conduct of this ugly duckling she had raised to be a great swan . How little she had dreamed , while he was being lectured out of the etiquette book , and hearing the genteel conversationof boarders and college students , how completely he was grasping the master-class psychology and makingit his own ! So that from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth , he would never offend their delicate sensibilities ; so that from the moment he joined their clan , he would act and speakP227as if he had spent all his ( lays in the Garden of Privilege ! " We 're going to see Mr. Warrener now , " Jed announced , and they bade farewell to Liza , and went out to the waiting taxi , whose driver was one large grin . When they got to the mansion on Fremont Plaza , Jed told Lulu Belle to wait in the library while he brake the news . He went upstairs , and found the faithful Miss Lucile reading to his patient . " So you 're back again , Rusher ! " said the old gentleman , his face lighting up with pleasure . " Well , what did you find ? " " It 's quite a long story ! " said Jed . " Maybe you do n't want to be interrupted now . " " No , indeed , my sister-in-law will be glad to have you back on the job . " Thus tactfully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gathered up her sewing things , and retired . Jed Rusher cleared his throat . Somehow this was the hardest part of his adventure . " Mr. Warrener , " he said , and felt the blood beginning to mount in his neck and cheeks , " so much has happened to me since I saw you last that I hardly know where to begin . I have done something that I hope you wo n't take exception to . " " What is it , Rusher ? " The old gentleman displayed one of his quizzical smiles . " Have you started to drill an oil well ? " " Much worse than that , Mr. Warrener . I hope you wo n't mind it too much . I have become your grandson-in-law. "  | The smile vanished like a light switched off , and amazement wrote itself upon the old man 's face . " You  --  what ? " " I have just got through marrying Lulu Belle . " " You  --  Lulu Belle ? Are you crazy ? " Jed began to talk quickly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not easy to tell . I fear you wo n't believe me ; but Lulu Belle is downstairs , waiting , and you can ask her about it  --  " " Where did you marry Lulu Belle ? " " At the home of my pastor , Reverend Glaub . " " Do her parents know it ? " " Mrs. Macy knows it  --  I just phoned to her . She ' did n't know it before . " " What  --  what  --  how did this happen ? " " You must let me tell the story , Mr. Warrener . There is no other way to understand . Three or four months ago Lulu Belle came to me  --  it was one day while you were asleep , and I was sitting in the next room , and she asked me how people had babies . She was unhappy because her mother had taken her doll away , and she had just seen her Cousin Marian 's new baby , and she wanted one of her own . Of course I told her that she should go to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refused again and again to tell her . I thought the matter over for a week or two , wondering if I ought to speak to you about it . Then I decided I 'd find out if her mother had warned her , so I asked her , and she . told me she had talked about it to some boy she knew , and this boy had told her , and had agreed to help her to have a baby , if she would n't ever tell his name . " The blood kept on mounting into Jed 's face while heP229talked , as fast as his tongue could go . He knew that this was an absolutely incredible story , and the fact that it had happened did not help him very much . " Jed Rusher , " said the old gentleman , sternly , " did you seduce that child ? " " As God is my witness , Mr. Warrener , I never touched her with so much as a finger . I had never even shaken hands with her . I kissed her for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's house . You may refuse to believe me , sir , but Lulu Belle will tell you , and you must know that she is not the sort who would lie . " " Go on , Rusher . " " Well , sir , of course I did n't know what to do . I thought I should tell you , but I knew it would mean a lot of unhappiness for the child , and maybe it would n't be necessary , perhaps she would n't be pregnant at all . So I kept putting it off ; until this noon , I had got back from the country , and was coming to see you , when there came a note from Lulu Belle  --  she did n't have my home address , of course , but she had taken a chance and written to me in care of your office  --  here is the letter , sir , and the envelope , you can see for yourself . " Jed handed over the letter , and Mr. Warrener glanced through it . " Go on . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and told her I insisted upon speaking to Lulu Belle . She did n't want to let me , but I told her I knew what she meant to do  --  to have an abortion  --  and that would be horrible , Mr. Warrener . I was determined not to let it happen . I wanted to warn Lulu Belle . I do n't know what you think about it  --  " " Why did n't you come to me about this , Rusher ? "   " I did n't know what to do , Mr. Warrener . I was distracted . I had only one thought , which was to keep Lulu Belle 's mother from calling in a doctor , or taking her to one . Her mother had been abusing her horribly , and the child was in such a state of desperation that I decided to act right away . I knew that if she married me , it would be all right for her to have her baby , and I was willing , because I know she is a good and dear child , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trouble . Of course , it is not so pleasant to think of having some other man 's child , but that was done and could n't he undone , and I thought it was my duty to help her . So I offered her that way out , and she accepted , and I went and got a license , and she ran out of the house and met me , and we were married . We came right here the first thing , because you are the one person I I think you owed it to me to consult me before you took such a step , Rusher . " " The reason I did n't , Mr. Warrener , was because I know myself better than anybody else can . I know that I can make Lulu Belle happy , I know that I can not merely get her out of the trouble she 's in now , but can be a good husband to her . " " You are very self-confident , boy . " " Well , I try to use good sense , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know that you have certain powers , it is merely hypocrisy not to admit it . I have seen a good deal of Lulu Belle , and I think I understand her ; also , I know I am going to make my way in the world , and he able to take care of her . T have been meeting a great many people since Ip231came to Mountain City , and T do n't think I 'm below the average of brains . " There was pause , while Jed felt his soul being looked through . Finally the old man said , " I want to talk to my grandchild . " " Yes , sir . " said Jed , with alacrity . " I 'll send her up , and stay downstairs until you send for inc . " He went down to the library , and told his bride , " It 's all right , he 's taking it very nicely . You only have to tell him the truth . " " Well , of course , " said Lulu Belle . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw traces of tears in the old gentleman 's eyes , and knew that Lulu Belle and her Grandpa had been having a love-feast . Also Jed knew that his future was secure , because no harm could ever come to him that would not harm Lulu Belle also . " Well , now , what are you children planning to do ? " inquired the dispenser of all bounties . " I want to take Lulu Belle away , Mr. Warrener ; I think the one thing everybody needs is a rest . Her father 's coming home to-night , and I think he 'd better have some time before he sees Lulu Belle or me . He 'd probably say things he 'd regret later on . " Mr. Warrener smiled his assent . " I thought I 'd take Lulu Belle to the ranch . That 's the story I have n't told you yet . " So Jed began , and told the tale of his trip to the mountains , and the Cudliff ranch , and the open oil well , and his negotiations ; also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squirrels ; then how he had come back and made a deal with Ed Cudliff . He varied the story in only one detail ; he did n't say he had taken the money with him , but that he had telegraphed to his sister when he got back to the railroad , and she had sent him some of the money she had got from an inheritance . Mr. Warrener was laughing when his grandson-inlawgot to the end of that tale , and handed him the escrow paper from the bank , with the price and all the business details set down in it . " My boy , " he exclaimed , " I ca n't keep up with you ! " " Well , Mr. Warrener , what was I to do ? There was oil , right out in plain sight , and somebody might come along any hour and snap it up . I figured that I was n't taking much of a chance ; I was sure you 'd see it as T did , and if you did n't , I would take it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back you , of course , now that you 're into it  --  and now that you 're into the family . Can you get possessionof that ranch at once ? " " Not very conveniently , because Ed Cudliff has to buy another place , and has to move his family , and that will take time . What I thought was , we could buy the Nichols place in the meantime . " " Oh ! So you want to buy the other ranch , too ! " " I want to buy several of them , Mr. Warrener , if I can persuade you to see the proposition . Just consider ; there 's a long ridge , a mile or so wide , and running five or ten miles long , and if there 's oil in the Cudliff place , there are the same signs in the Nichols place , and there 's a very good chance the pool runs the whole way under the ridge . "  | " You ca n't own the whole oil industry of the country , Jed Rusher . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ i f I can persuade you to back me . If T had fifty or sixty thousand dollars cash , I could go in there quietly and buy up a big tract . You see the wonderful part about it , the land is mostly worthless , even for pasture , it 's too high and dry , so it can be bought cheap ; you know how the ranchers are fixed just now , a little real money seems like heaven to them . I 'd get the whole thing cinched before I started drilling , or even dropped a hint about oil . " " What 's your idea about drilling ? You want to take some oil people in ? " " No , sir , it 's the last thing in the world I 'll do , if I have my way . They 'd simply try to hog it all , and there 'd be a fight from the start . If I could persuade you to take a half interest , and let me go ahead on my own , I 'd put a well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd do it on contract ? " " No , sir , I would n't even do that . I 've been readingall the technical books I can get , and I see that drillingis unsatisfactory as a contract proposition , there are so many uncertainties and delays . My idea would be to buy my own rig , and get drillers , and put the job through myself . I 'd be right there , so I could watch it , and know exactly what I was getting for my money . It 's easy enough to hire technical knowledge ; the main thing is to be a judge of men , and then to watch them , and let them understand that they ca n't fool you . " " I see , " said Mr. Warrener , respectfully . " You 've got it all laid out exactly . " " Well , I 've had a lot of time to think about it ; and naturally , I began making plans . "  | " You speak of living at the other ranch at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to sell the stock and all , so they could vacate at once ; also , they have no women or children to move . What I thought was , I 'd hire them to run the place ; they 're friendly little fellows , and would make good caretakers and foremen for the tract . I could put them up in tents for a month , until Cudliff got out of his place , and then I 'd fix up a tenant-house ; you can buy ready-cut houses and put them up in a jiffy . " " That 's all right . Do you think you 'll like to live on a ranch for a while , Lulu Belle ? " " Oh , Grandpa , it will be lovely ! Mr. Rusher  --  that is , Jed says I can have horses to ride , and all sorts of pets . If only I did n't have to think of Mamma and Papa being so angry with me ! " " I 'll see about that , " said the old gentleman , and took the receiver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Jed put in , quickly , " I told Mrs. Macy she could give out the news about the wedding , and say that she and Mr. Macy were present . They could say it was after he got back from Chicago . The minister has promised not to say anything on the subject . " " A good idea , " said Mr. Warrener . " If you manage to think about everything as you go through life , you 'll lick the world , Jed . " The younger man smiled with pleasure , for it was exactly what he meant to do . Also , he noted that he was taken into the family , being called by his first name for the first time , both by his employer and by his wife !   " Jane , " said Mr. Warrener , to his daughter , over the telephone , " Lulu Belle and her husband are here in my room , and we have been talking things over . Yes , I admit it was rather sudden , but it 'll turn out better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a sensible young man , with no agnostic or radical ideas like your father , and you 'll learn to like him as a son-in-law . He 's a little too bent on getting rich to suit my taste , but you have no kick on that score , and he and Wallace will be bosom friends , I predict . " Mr. Warrener cast a sidelong smile at Jed as he said this ; and Jed smiled in turn , for he was perfectly willing to " tell the world " that he was going to be rich . Also , he had no objection to Wallace J. Macy , Real Estate and Insurance  --  except that he thought it rather a piker 's business , with a mass of detail and very small profits . Mrs. Macy must have been uttering her anguish ; for the old gentleman listened for a while , and looked alternatelysympathetic and amused . " It seems to me you 've got out of your troubles rather well , Jane . You 've only yourself to blame because you would n't teach your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't be any scandal , unless you and Wallace make it , by going around with heartbroken faces . The best thing you can do is to cheer up in a hurry and put your mind on giving the right sort of announcement to the papers . No , it 'll be perfectly safe . Say that the weddingwas in this house , and was private on account of the state of my health ; it was held this evening , and you and Wallace were here . The groom is a junior at Mountain City University , and the young couple have left for a thousand acre ranch in the Red Sandy Mountains , which the groom owns . Yes , he really owns it . No , he bought it with his own money . Your son-in-law is going to own more land than your husbandever dreamed of ; he may save us all from the poor-house yet . Yes , they 're going away to-night ; I ' 1l give them one of my cars . " It was one time when Jed did n't mind old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , while Jed was treated seriously , his powers and talents appreciated ; he was a member of the great clan , and his future was a matter of concern . " I 'll give them one of my cars " : just as simply as that did the great ones of the earth settle problems ! The old gentleman hung up the receiver , and turned to the young couple again . " All right , now for business , " he said . " Jed , I 'll back you in your oil venture , and if you do n't strike it , at least you 'll have a big enough ranch ! I 'll put a hundred thousand dollars to your credit in the Fourth National Bank to-morrow morning , and you go ahead and buy the rest of that land you want , and get in your oil rig . What I exact in return is that you give Lulu Belle a half interest in the entire thing , both the land and the oil-company , as her separate property . " " Certainly , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have a share also . It was your enterprise at the start . " " No , my share is my granddaughter 's . She 's entitled to something from me ; all the others have had it , and when she gets married , it 's her turn . But neither of you say anything to anybody else about what I 've done , for that 's none of their business , and you try toP237keep out of the family wrangles  --  till after I 'm dead , at least . " " Be sure of that , Mr. Warrener . We two are going to make our own way . " " All right , that 's settled . Take the phone , before Jermin leaves the office , and tell him to come up here . He 's a notary , and he can get the papers ready in the library , and we can all sign them right now , before we forget what we 've agreed , and start to disagreeing . And another thing , of course what Lulu Belle and you have told me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked about , and nobody is ever going to know anything about that story . I gather that Jane thinks that you , Jed , are responsible for Lulu Belle 's condition . All right , it wo n't do any harm for her to go on thinking it , you 've done the best you can to make amends , and everything is all right . Is that all clear ? " " Yes , sir , " said Jed ; and Lulu Belle began suddenly and unexpectedly to cry again , and kissed her poor old grandfather on both cheeks , and told him that he was too good , and she was too happy.  |p238JED  Rusher was the ranch-boy who had found himself a wishing cap ; he had used it freely , and got himselfeverything the heart of a ranch-boy could desire . He went rolling out of the city that evening in a " de luxe " sedan , with a well-stuffed wallet in his breastpocket , and a blooming bride in the seat beside him . They spent the night in a palatial hotel at " the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magic breakfast table , shiningwith silver and crystal and snowy " napery "  --  so it was called in the etiquette book  --  and a waiter all smiles and bows , setting before each of them a silver dish of crushed ice , with half a big yellow grapefruit in the middle of it . By the side of his plate  --  such are the triumphs of civilization  --  lay a copy of that morning 's Mountain City newspaper , brought down on an early train , so that Jed might read aloud to his bride the story , at once romantic and respectable , of how they had last night been married in the home of the bride 's grandfather : a " love-match , " according to the story , between a junior at the university , and the heiress of two of the city 's great fortunes  --  sole heiress of one and part heiress of another . Full details about the greatness of both the Warreners and the Macys , and a decorous explanationp239to the effect that on account of the grandfather 's illness , the ceremony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few members of the family present , including the bride 's mother and father and great-aunt , and the groom 's sister , Miss Elizabeth Rusher . Jed imagined the Niagara of gossip which would now be pouring over the breakfast table at the boardinghouse ! And the envy of all his friends and classmates , now assembling for the new college term ! Jed was not going to be there  --  Jed was through with education ; he had taken his leap from the springboard , and was cleaving his way through an ocean of gold  --  no , that metaphor would not do , something swifter was needed ! Say , in the words which he had learned in his course on poetry from Milton to Pope , that he was " sailing with supreme dominion through the azure deeps of air ! " It was a fact that never before in his life had Jed written his name in the register of a palatial hotel , and never before had he tasted one of those mysterious big yellow grapefruit . But he took it with quiet dignity , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her life , and would be startled by the idea that anybody else was not used to them . Let her think that his exultation , his beaming smiles , were all due to the fact that he had captured her ! That was the way to keep her happy . They did some shopping before they continued their journey . Lulu Belle had nothing with her , and he told her to get what she needed  --  and right there she taught him a lesson about the leisure classes . It was n't her fault , it was the way she had been brought up , so Jed had to remind himself , and he kept smiling gamely while she went into the most expensive shops , and ordered whatever took her fancy , without even thinking to ask the prices . It was a riot , and pretty well filled up the back part of the sedan , and perceptibly lightened the wad in Jed 's inside breast-pocket . But that was all right , there was plenty more where this had come from , and half of it would always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon after noon , and waited for a train from Mountain City , from which stepped a tall , expansive young man in a showy plaid brown suit , carrying a suit-case in each hand and a beaming smile on his face : Jed 's chum  --  or the nearest he had to a chum  --  Dick Sunstorm , fresh from the city that morning , pursuant to a telephone conversation which Jed had had with him on the previous evening . " Dick , I want to tell you some news , and do n't fall over , I 've married my boss 's granddaughter , and I 've got all the money there is , and I 'm going into the ranchingbusiness on a new plan , with a big investment , and what do you want to waste your time with that fool college any more  --  come ahead with me , and I 'll make you my business manager and start you off with three hundred a month , with your first month 's salary the first day , and I 'll raise you as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take you up and show you the place . " So there was good old Dick with his wavy brown locks , handsome , talkative , somewhat vulgar , Jed knew , but good-hearted and loyal , a fellow he could work with , and give orders to , and know they would be carried out ; a fellow with sound business sense , for all his flashy manners , as eager to learn and get ahead as Jed himself . Now he was so rattled he hardly knew how top241walk down a station platform and lift his hat to a lady . He had read the morning pipers , and could n't take his eyes off Lulu Belle ; he did n't have the nerve even to touch her hand . I ! is excitement was honey to Jed , but he kept his manner of case , and slipped Dick a check for three hundred dollars on the quiet . He took him to the sedan and got him settled amid the bundles of lingerie and sweaters and toilet articles and canned goods and mountain climbing boots and lace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think of needing . Jed took the steering-wheel , and away they went  --  and never would you have guessed that yesterday was the first time in his life that Jed had driven a high-powered car , or that his previous experience had been with a grocer 's delivery truck , filling in time while his brother Tom was laid up with the mumps ! They arrived that evening at the Nichols ranch , and Jed said he had brought his wife and a friend for a little hunting . Nothing was said about his having just been married , and nothing about his business plans . To Lulu Belle he had already explained that nothing was to be said about oil , not even to Dick ; that would all come later , after the land had been bought . Before the evening was over , Jed had taken the two little brown squirrels outside , where Lulu Belle would not be offendedby the butchering operation , and had beaten down the price of their ranch and stock from fifteen thousand to ninety-five hundred dollars . He drew up a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had them sign it with Dick as witness.  |p242Then  he made them the offer to work for him , taking care of the place , and the Cudliff place which he had bought ; he offered them fifty dollars a month each and keep , and they accepted with alacrity , and considered they had got rich . They agreed that next morning they would move themselves and their belongings , includingthe half-witted nephew , out of the main house into an old carriage-house where they could make out temporarily , until the move was made to the larger ranch . Next morning , leaving Lulu Belle in the care of the amiable squirrels , Jed and Dick set out on what they pretended was a look at the country , but was really a land buying expedition . In the course of the morning Jed hired a car from one of the neighboring ranches so that he and Dick could work separately ; and when they met at the Nichols place that evening and compared notes , they found that they had options on several of the ranches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at prices ranging from five to fifteen dollars an acre . Dick was elated to discover that he had paid less than Jed ; and that was all right with Jed , it was proof that he had hired a first-rate business man . Nor did he mind having his friend think him out of his mind ; he listened smilingly and said it was all right , he knew there was n't much water on this land , but he had a new scheme , it would work out all right , and all Dick had to do was to obey orders and not talk . Jed had most of the ranchers from Coyote Arroyo in town next day , together with their wives , and the escrowdepartment at the bank did more business than it had done in any previous month . The ranchers got together , of course , and realized that something was " up "  --  a big capitalist from the city was buying up the whole neighborhood , and they quickly guessed the reason . They decided that they were being " swindled , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payments , and they and their wives had put their signaturesto contracts of sale , which the escrow officer at the bank had to tell them were binding , and so likewise said the one lawyer the town boasted . Jed had received in the mail a letter from the faithful Jerniin , enclosing a letter of credit which he had presented to the bank ; so he was good for a hundred thousand dollars , and all the deals went through on schedule  --  all but one , in which the wife became hysterical , and refused to sign , and since it was a homestead , her signature was necessary . But that was all right with Jed  --  he had a lawsuitwhich would take a year or two , and cost him a few hundred dollars , but in the end he would get the title . Meanwhile Jed was still busy , for he had to have a road into the tract , over which he could bring heavy machinery , and that meant some negotiating . His intimateacquaintance with county political affairs , gained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in good stead here . He did not bother with the road supervisors , but got the name of the man who ran the local Republican machine , and paid a call on him , and paid him a thousand dollars cash , with no receipt requested and no witnessespresent . Jed wanted a road , and he wanted it right away , and he was going to live and work in this vicinity " You going to drill for oil ? " asked the gentleman  --  he was a retired horse-doctor , and chairman of the county central committee . " I 'm going to engage in a large and profitable enter- prise , " said Jed , " provided that my neighbors make it possible by showing public spirit and sense . I 'm going to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars , maybe millions ; and what is important to you , I 'm going to be regular , and work with the machine , and when you need campaign funds , you 'll know where to come . So do your part , and do n't tie me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American community and not a backwoods dump . " After which Jed went to the local manager of the telephone company , and explained his important businessplans , and asked the cooperation of that gentleman in getting a line over the many miles of country to the Cudliff ranch . The magic word " oil " had reached this telephone official , of course ; but all Jed stated was , a very large business , with hundreds of dollars of long distance calls every day . When he left the official 's desk , he left behind him , as if by accident , an envelope containing five hundred dollars , and the " accident " was never reported to him . He saw the telephone men putting up poles and stringing lines early the next week , and also saw the road gangs and scrapers pulling rocks out of the way of his car , and making it possible for him to travel fifteen or twenty miles an hour instead of five or six . IIIMany other things to be attended to by a busy young nian of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been ordered to hold himself at Mr. Rusher 's convenience . Through Jermin it was arrangedthat a shipment of fresh fruits and vegetablesP245should arrive twice a week at Mesa Verde , to be brought up by whoever was coming to the ranch . He arranged with a local dealer who sold cattle on commission , to dispose of the stock of the Nichols ranch ; for Jed wanted the Nichols brothers to wait on him and Lulu lielle , and not on a couple of hundred steers . What he wanted for the place were three or four good fresh cows , and these he bought . Also he hired a grown girl from one of the ranches to do the houseworkand cooking , so that Lulu Belle and her expected baby would not have to live on the yellow soda-biscuits of the half-wit nephew . He arranged for a couple of local carpenters to proceed to the Cudliff place and build extra rooms in which employees might be housed . In all these affairs , Jed was the master ; waving his magic wand , and seeing men hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life he had been dreaming ever since boyhood ; now he was only twenty-two , and he had got it ! His heart was full of glory , and every act was a separate thrill ; he could never have enough of hopping into his car and hurrying here and there , signingorders , paying out money , telephoning for this and that . Yet he did not lose his head ; every step was calculated to one end , and he never lost sight of it . If he indulged in extravagance , it was not for himself , but for Lulu Belle  --  and that too was a matter of business . She was used to extravagance , she was entitled to it , and if it made her happy , it was the best investment of all . Whenever he phoned to Mr. Warrener , the old gentleman would say , " Make the child comfortable ; do n't let her suffer up in that lonely place ; get what she needs , and I 'll pay for it . " And presently , here was the haughty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five thousand dollar check , along with her prayers and tears ! Of course Lulu Belle must have things ! Of course there must be servants hurrying to wait on her , and carpenters putting up rooms for the servants ; there must be a telephone so that she could express her wishes , and a road so that automobiles and trucks could fill the orders . Nothing she was used to must be missing , and new things must be added , even before she thought of them . Even to a Collie puppy , brown and silky and warm , soft-eyed , soft-bellied , full of romping , altogetheradorable ! Jed stumbled on this treasure in the hay and feed store where he was making a purchase for his cows , and he bought it for five dollars , and tumbled it into the car , and when it arrived , he had his reward , for Lulu Belle screamed with delight , and clasped it in her arms , and was thereafter hardly to be separated from it , even at bedtime . Oh , it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the whole world ; it took the place of the long lost " dollie , " and for five or six months was prophecy and anticipation of the promised baby . Every young thing on the ranch was that  --  a litter of kittens , and an incubator full of chicks , soft and tender young things upon which Lulu Belle could practice her maternal thrills . Jed returned to the city , and reported to Mr. Warrener . The latter called up Perry Sanderson , who was a brother of Mrs. Clive Warrener , and one of the biggestoil men in the West , and explained what Jed was doing . There was no longer any secret about oil now ,  |p247and  Mr. Warrener asked Mr. Sanderson to lend his new kinsman by marriage one of his experienced and reliable foremen . The other replied that he would do so , of course , and added an invitation for Jed to meet him at the Mountain City Club for luncheon and consultation . Another experience for Jed  --  his first club , and a very august and impressive one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's ruling class , amid quiet splendor ; under expert ministrations they partook of lunch or dinner , and meanwhile settled the problems of industry , finance and government . Perry Sanderson , a big sixfooter , a ranchman who had forced his way in among these great ones , understood Jed and Jed 's purposes , and wasted no time on preliminaries . Each of them was " out for the stuff , " and they crossed sword-blades and measured each other at that first meeting . Powerfuland rather gruff , the president of " Central Pete " warned Jed that the oil game was a hard one for a novice , and that he would be safer with a big organizationbehind him . He offered his own organization for that purpose , and made it plain that he expected his new kinsman to accept . But Jed , who had been expecting that very thing , shied off . It was a whim of his , he said , to try a little flyer ; all the fun would be spoiled if he turned it over to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and said he would find Jed a good man for the drilling job . When Jed got back to the field , he learned that " scouts " had already been inquiring into everything he had done , and were buying up land all around him ; he was not surprised when later on it transpired that these were representatives of " Central Pete . "   But Jed got his foreman , a wiry old veteran of many battles with the underground powers . In this man 's company he purchased his derrick-lumber and his " drillstem , " his " rotary-table " and " draw-works " and " mudhogs , " and the big stationary engine which was to move all these . They were loaded onto a fleet of trucks , and started on the long journey to the field . A crew was hired , and these rode on the trucks , or were shipped out by train ; within two weeks the derrick was up , and roofed over and boarded in , all tight and snug for winter drilling . A great sensation throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundred miles away , and the price of land at Coyote Arroyo , which had been doubled once or twice already , was doubled again . The site of the derrick was directly over the handdugwell of Ed Cudliff , and the bucket and rope with which he had dipped up oil were kept as a curiosity . It pleased Jed 's fancy to preserve the incident for posterity by naming his first enterprise the " Tar-bucket Oil Company , " from which presently came the name , the " Tar-bucket field . " Before long the original bucket was mounted in a glass-case , and that in turn set up in a log-hut ; a sacred relic , the talisman of the enterprise and mascot of its owner . It would be loaded onto a truck and taken to exhibitions here and there , and the newspapers always gave it generous space , and told the story all over again  --  there could be no better advertisingfor the Tar-bucket gasoline , and Tar-bucket lubricants , and the other products of the Tar-bucket refineries . For it was a matter of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the news leaked out ,  |p249and  the big rush to the field began . Then came that marvelous , never-to-he-forgotten day when " TarbucketRusher Number One "  --  such was the name of the well  --  met with its glorious calamity , " blowing off its head , " and shooting up two hundred feet into the air a huge column of the precious " black gold . " Over half a million dollars a day it was estimated that eruptioncost , and owing to the remoteness of the field , it was more than two weeks before the waste was stopped . But that was a small matter , there was plenty more down underneath ; within a year there were several more gushers like that , and derricks raising their heads for five or ten miles along the ridge and down into the valley . It was the newest and biggest of the bonanza fields , destined to add one or two hundred more to the thirty-seven thousand millionaires of America . And Jed Rusher was right in the middle of it ! Jed had the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pool ! He did n't have it all ; unfortunately the anticline took a turn down into the valley , but he had enough to make him one of the great men of the state , and one of the heroes of pioneer legend . This college youth of twenty-three  --  he had just celebrated a birthday before the well " came in "  --  this ranch-boy who had tended cattle and crawled around in the muck of the beetfields , and then married a rich man 's daughter , and made for his bride a fortune many times as great as her father had ever seen  --  that was a story made to order for feature articles and Sunday supplements . Jed became a front page story for the Mountain City " Mail , " which worshiped success , and the country and its institutionswhich made success possible , and never publishedan issue without glorifying the greatest country and the greatest institutions and the greatest newspaper in the history of mankind . The reporters came rushing out to the field in autos and even in airplanes , so frantic was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the gusher , and of its lucky young owner . They would have photographed Jed in a hundred poses and a hundred costumes , if they could have got him to stop long enough to pose , or even to shave his face . But Jed had no time even to speak to them , he was rushing about the place day and night , haggard , unshaven , stained with oil , trying one plan after another to stop that frightful waste . The only time they could get him still was when he was at the telephone , ordering new equipment , or storming becausesome had not arrived on time . Sometime before that eruption , Lulu Belle had been bundled into a sleigh , together with her governess and her puppy and her kittens , and followed by another sleigh full of suit-cases and hat-boxes and trunks . The Cudliff ranch-house was no longer a fit home for a daughter of privilege , it was overrun by a mob of sightseers , and reporters and speculators and workmen and what-not ; it was the site of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tar-paper , and destined to grow in a year or two into a town with a double row of brick buildings , including a bank and a moving picturetheater . Moreover , Lulu Belle was come to a condition which could no longer be concealed from the world , and it was embarrassing , because of the fact that the date ofP251her marriage was known to all the papers , and was republishedat the time the well " came in . " Jed , who had been raised on a ranch , and knew ranch-talk , could look forward to the time when it would be the joke of the field that both his well and his wife had " come in " ahead of time . So he was glad when Lulu Belle 's Mamma took cognizance of the situation , and insisted upon taking her daughter out to California , and keepingher there while the child was born , and for long enough afterward so that nobody could definitely fix the infant 's age , and thus constitute a scandal . This was a decision of great importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lulu Belle could have stayed on at the ranch , she would have got an education in practical affairs which would have been priceless to her ; she would have learned to make decisions and carry responsibilities . Also , she would have learned something about her husband 's affairs in their early stages , and have had something to talk to him about in future years . In short , they might have had a life together . But instead of that , they had to be torn apart before they had had time to grow together ; they had to be kept apart for nearly a year . Lulu Belle , who was to bring a living " dollie " into the world , must continue to be little more than that herself ; sheltered and petted , waited upon by servants , and growing up in ignorance of any function save the spending of her husband 's money . And meantime , Jed was busy making the money , and learning to do it alone , without companionship or sympathy . In truth , Jed was almost too busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had got what he wanted , money , fame , and power ; but he found that he had got some- thing else that he did n't want and had not bargained for  --  a thousand problems tumbled onto his shoulders , a thousand cares hounding him day and night . But that was all right , he told himself , it was only temporary ; wait till he got things organized and runningsmoothly , and then he would be cultured and serene , like Mr. Warrener and Mr. Evarts and other very rich men he knew . Only while he was getting his organization started , picking his executives and getting his storage tanks erected , and his pipe-line built , and the machinations of his rivals anticipated and overcome  --  only for this brief period would he have eighteenhourwork-days , and then sometimes sleepless nights ! In course of time Jed found that he had to be away more and more from the field . No longer would he give his time to drilling operations and the physical handling of oil . No , for that he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick Sunstorm . Having been " raised " to a thousand dollars a month , with a few shares of stock for a bonus , Dick would stay in the Cudliff ranch-house , and watch over Jed 's affairs , and report to him daily by telephone and mail . Jed 's , place was up in Mountain City , where money was stored and handled , and great deals were put through , with the aid of banks and brokers having private wire connectionsto Chicago and New York . Jed Rusher would be at last that supreme thing which only six months ago he had decided to become  --  an oil financier ! He would have his office with several rooms in the Fourth National Bank Building , with a private secretary who was the younger brother of the faithful Jermin  --  " Jed 's Jermin " would be his name within the family . He would have an office manager , and a staffP253of bookkeepers and stenographers , and in his private office there would lw a polished mahogany desk with a big sheet of glass on top of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all those conveniences which are at the same time symbols of power and success . Clear the way for Jed Rusher ! P254THE original Tar-bucket Oil Company , formed before the drilling got under way , issued one thousand shares of a par value of one hundred dollars . Of these Jed Rusher held four hundred and fifty , and Lulu Belle Rusher the same ; Elizabeth Rusher held seventy , and Dick Sunstorm thirty . Under this arrangement , Jed would have control so long as either his wife or his sister stood by him . The three directors of this parent company were Liza , Jed , and Dick ; Jed was president , Liza vice-president , and Dick secretary-treasurer . Jed had offered a director 's post to Claudius G. Warrener , but the old gentleman had said no , he was n't equal to it . He suggested mildly that Jed ought to lave an expert financial man on the board , but Jed replied that he did not want any stranger in the enterprise , with whom he might possibly be unable to work . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along , and be a financial man very quickly . He would never fail to come and ask Mr. Warrener 's advice . So far , had he not proved himself equal to the job ? That simple incorporation , which anybody could understand , served until after the well came in . But then , overnight , everything was changed ; the genie had got out of the bottle , and his shadow began to darkenP255the sky . The Tar-bucket Oil Company had immense quantities of crude petroleum which it must bring to the surface and handle and store and ship out and market ; there was immediate need of storage tanks and a pipe-line , and shipping arrangements with the railroads , and complicated contracts with refiners and distributors  --  awhole universe of new entanglements , of which Jed had no experience whatever . About him came swarming a host of " expert financial men , " whose expertness consisted exclusively in their ability to get Jed 's money out of his hands and into their own : which was exactly the reverse of the kind of expertness which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a violent maelstrom , composed of actively whirling wolves which sought to snap off large chunks of him , and were capable of swallowing him at one gulp . They kept his telephone ringing day and night ; they sent him scores of urgent telegrams of great length ; they sent him special delivery registered letters , and then active young " go-getters " to lay siege to his door . When these go-getters had gone but not gotten , the " principals " themselves took up the task  --  large , expansive gentlemen with double chins and necks , armed with credentials from the biggest banks in New York and Chicago , and membership or guest-cards at the MountainCity Club . Their propositions had to do with financing " Tarbucket . " They would go off by themselves , or with their lawyers and " securities counsel , " and like spiders they would spin out of their inner selves the most elaborate webs , like grubs they would construct ingeniouscocoons for the sheltering of themselves and Jed Rusher and his " Tar-bucket " : operating companies , marketing companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ developing , deglutating and digesting , concealing and consuming and complicating and confiscating companies . When Jed had studied these ingenious contraptions , and dug out the essence of what the contrivers had endeavored to conceal , he found that he was to get a small share of the gains from his property , and the contrivers were to get most of it , while the general public would get the " sack . " For a young man without any previous experience in the financial game , Jed developed a remarkably efficient technique . It consisted of saying , over and over again , " No , I thank you . " He would never make an unnecessaryenemy ; he would never sneer at anybody , never denounce them , never frown at their annoying persistence , never pound the table or order them out . He would just say , over and over again , most cordially , that he thanked them for their great interest in his Tarbucket , but he could not see his way at present to accept their propositions , he was going slowly with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ until he was more familiar with the situation and its possibilities . His secretary learned this formula , and took to repeatingit in telegrams and letters , and verbally to the young go-getters , as well as to the large expansive gentlemen with the double chins and necks and credentials . This applied even in the bosom of the family : it applied to the Sandersons , relatives-in-law of old Mr. Warrener 's only son . Mr. Perry Sanderson took it for granted that the Tar-bucket was to be a family bucket , and when he found that it was not so , he became greatlyp257annoyed . He came back to Jed again and again with propositions , each time allowing him a larger share of the securities of the proposed new companies , and even trying to tempt him with small quantities of the " inside " shares of Central Pete  --  that is to say , the securities which drew the real profits , and were a cherished family possession , never sold on the market , and seldom even heard of . Jed was friendly and inquisitive , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and many propositions turned down , that the energetic Mr. Perry realized the truth , which was that Jed Rusher had been " pumping " him , in order to find out exactly how these " inside " companies were organized , and how the public was made to think it was getting the grain when really it was getting the chaff . The final outcome was that , in spite of all Jed 's politeness , Perry Sanderson and his organization becameJed 's bitter enemies , and set out to check him in every possible way , both in the field and in the banks . But that was all right with Jed , it was what they were all doing , and perfectly to be understood and expected . The Sandersons had oil to sell , and there was too much of it on the market , the price was forever sagging . Naturally they did not like to have a rival burst into the field ; they were terrified by this new portent in the sky , a gigantic Tar-bucket pouring out unceasing Niagaras of black gold . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Sandersons , by intrigue and espionage and bribery ; each would know what the other was doing , and when they net in the lounge of the Mountain City Club , or at the Katonah Country Club , or at dinner-parties in the Warrener or Macy homes , they would be just as cordial as any of the other pachyderms which were roaming the financial and industrial jungle . But Jed had to have money , large quantities of money , and in a hurry . There were tens of thousands of others in the same position throughout America , and the banks and trust companies and finance and securities corporations existed for the purpose of taking advantage of their urgent needs , and forcing them to part with the greater part of their business , in return for the funds necessary to keep it going . In the normal course of events , Jed Rusher would have shared the fate of these others . What saved him was the fact which had got him every dollar he owned so far , and enabled him to buy the ranches and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a member of the Macy-Warrener clans , and entitled to all the privileges and immunities which went with such membership . Lulu Belle , a granddaughterof Claudius G. Warrener and a daughter of Wallace J. Macy , was sharing equally with Jed in every dollar of gain or loss ; therefore the clans would rally , and assert their high and royal rights of privilege and immunity : Jed Rusher must not be plundered and plucked like a common adventurer into the financial jungle , but must be , according to the gracious and comfortingterm in use among the banking fraternity , " taken care of . " He was a customer of the Fourth National Bank , and old Mr. Warrener was rumored and generally believedto be the owner of a majority of the shares of that great institution ; Mr. Warrener was a director , and so was Wallace J. Macy ; and therefore it was Jed'sp259idea to get his money there . The Fourth National would finance the development of Tar-bucket , and do it at the ordinary rate for ordinary loans , which was seven percent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premiums and " rake-offs " and secret gifts of shares of stock to officers and directors , by which the bankers of America have come to be the richest men in the world , erecting their gorgeous palaces of white marble and gray granite , with elegant masses of bronze grill-work , and steel vaults with shining mechanisms and doors so beautifully balanced that a child can close them with one finger , but the most skillfulcracksmen can not open them until eight-thirty on business mornings . Jed sat down to a session of the loan committee of the Fourth National , and here for the first time he permittedhimself to become emphatic . He was a customer of this bank , and was going to be perhaps its biggest customer ; did they want to drive him to their rivals across the street ? Or did they want to force him to go into the banking business for himself ? What was a bank for , if not to finance legitimate industry , and make it possible for a business man to produce commodities for which there was a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kept by the bankers for magazine articles and speeches at banquets ; they were n't used to hearing it in their private council chambers , and they hemmed and hawed , and said that Mr. Rusher expected too much of one institution . It was true that his property was a sound one , but the production of oil was always uncertain , and so was its marketing , and this represented a serious risk for a bank to take . In short , they wanted what all the others wanted , a share in Jed 's enterprise ; they wanted the shares of the Tar-bucket Oil Company , not as collateral , but as a " bonus . " And then was the time for Jed to pound the table and impress his personality upon the world , and make the bankers understand that he was not one of their victims , but one of themselves . He took the matter to old Mr. Warrener , and here developed an amusing situation . Jed 's grand father-inlaw , principal stockholder of the Fourth National , declared that all bankers were pirates @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old-time robber-barons , who built castles along trade-routes , and levied tribute upon every caravan that passed . It was a colossal graft , entrenched and protected by government . Jed was ordered to go to the familiar files , and consult the index " Banking , " subhead " National , " and he would see how the government let the national banks issue notes , paying the government two and a half percentfor the privilege , and lending the public seven times as much money at anywhere from seven to seventy percent . Here was this report of a former Comptroller of the Currency , showing that according to their own admissions a majority of the national banks of the country were committing the crime of usury all the time , and that on short-time loans they frequently charged , if you included the bonuses and other items , as high as seventy and eighty and one hundred percent . No , said Mr. Warrener , that bunch of sharpers down at the corner of Seventh and Broad should not be allowed to plunder Jed and Lulu Belle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting in his bedroom and turn them all out ! The old gentleman went on scolding , in his humorous , mocking way  --  so that Jed could never bep261sure which he disapproved of most , the bankers who were trying to plunder the oil men , or the oil men who were trying to plunder the public . In course of time old Mr. Walter Evarts happened in on one of these consultations , and he addressed himself to Jed . " The trouble with you , my boy , is that you 're ten years behind the times . You go to a bank for money  --  but nobody with any sense does that any more . " " What do they do ? " said Jed  --  always ready to receive free information . " When you go to a bank for money , you have to pay ; but you can get your money from the public , and make them pay for the privilege of lending it to you . " " How do you do that , Mr. Evarts ? " " Issue a million or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With all the advertising the Tar-bucket is getting , they 'll be subscribed a dozen times over . " " But then I 'd lose control . " " Nonsense ! Start an operating company , or a financing company , or whatever you choose to call it , and keep the voting power in your own hands . Assign the control to certain segregated shares , or " founder 's shares , " as they call them . Sell the public Class A stock , or non-voting stock , or some such scheme . Then you can unload all the shares the market will take , and still be boss of it all . " " But I 'd have to pay over the profits , Mr. Evarts , and I thought  --  " " You thought you knew something about business , P262but you need a good Wall Street man to advise you . You do n't have to pay the public any more than you want to pay  --  just enough to keep up the price of your shares . Any good lawyer can fix it for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company , which is you and your wife . Or you can keep the profits as surplus , ' and use it for your own purposes , which is just the same as if you owned it outright . That 's the newest modern wrinkle  --  a surplus ' ; that makes you a bank , all by yourself , without any banking laws to tie you down , and no state or federal examiners coming round with itching palms , snooping into your business . No corporation amounts to anything nowadays unless it has twenty or thirty millions of surplus lying all ready , and the big fellows keep two or three hundred million . With that much money you 're the cock of the walk , and can make snoots at the bankers , as the children say . " That sounds very interesting , " said Jed . Of course he was n't really so naive ; he had been listening to a lot of financial talk , but he knew it pleased the older generation to instruct the younger . " What you need , Rusher , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and knows the newest wrinkles . " " Why do n't you come in with me , Mr. Evarts ? I could make it worth your while  --  this is going to be a really big thing before I get through . " " Yes , my boy ; too big , I fear  --  they 'll take it away from you  --  especially if you fool with the banks . They 'll catch you short , with that enormous amount of development work you have to do . They 'll promise to carry you , and diddle you along , and then at the last minute they 'll tell you they ca n't renew the notes.  |p263You  'll go to some other bank , and they 'll say that etiquette forbids them to help you , you have to go to the bank where you keep your account . The first thing you know , they 'll have your Tar-bucket and everything in it . " " Come show me how to beat them , Mr. Evarts . " " No , my days for hard work are over . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to utilize my acquaintance with you to make a little money on the side . Some day you 'll drop me a hint that you 're going to pay a big dividend , and I 'll load up with Tar-bucket ; or maybe I 'll see you looking worried , and Claude lending you some cash , and I 'll sell you short . " The roundfaced , bald-headed old bronze Buddha said this with a smile , which took the sting off it , but did not keep Jed from knowing that he would do exactly what he said . " No , Jed , " he went on , " I do n't want any duties . But you bring me your set-up when you have it ready , and I 'll go over it with you . See Abe Silberman , and tell him I sent you , so he wo n't play tricks on you . That 's the sort of lawyer you need  --  he can fix you so you can break all the laws of God and man , and get paid for it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wineman , saw Jed Rusher by appointment in his not so sumptuous offices in the Merchants ' and Traders ' Bank Building . He was a plain old fellow , who put on no " side . " He had a long thin face , a prominent nose , hanging pouches to his cheeks , thin , straggly hair on the sides of his head , and little shrewd eyes which he blinked frequently . His resemblance to a vulture was uncanny , and he increased it by sitting heaped in his chair with shoulders hunched . He was cordial to Jed Rusher , of course ; he knew all about him and his Tar-bucket , and pleased him by his well measured and exact compliments . Mr. Silbermanhad a soft voice , that made you think of velvet ; he was a man of wide culture , having spent his youth in Vienna , and having a home full of art treasures which in due course he would show to Jed , graciously helping to conceal the fact that Jed knew nothing whatever about such things . Mr. Silberman knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none shrewder in the city . He knew Mr. Warrener , a very remarkable man , the sort who would be appreciated in other parts of the world , rather than in his native city , which boasted of six hundred real estate firms and less than a score of bookstores . They got down to business . Mr. Rusher wanted to incorporate his enterprise , and have the investing public provide the necessary funds for its development . Quite so , it was what Mr. Silberman had expected ; no doubt the market would absorb a quite large amount , ten or twenty millions  --  one would have to have the advice of brokers about that . Mr. Silberman could suggest a firm which had a branch in Mountain City , Almayer and Hartmann , they had handled many of the big developmentsout here ; Mr. Rusher would be wise to market the shares through the regular channels . Jed replied cautiously that he was n't sure , it would depend on what commission the brokers wanted . To himself he was thinking , " I suppose this fellow gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk to Mr. Silberman , P265he understood so perfectly what Jed wanted , anticipatingevery sentence before it came out of the younger man 's mouth . Yes , of course , Mr. Rusher wanted to keep the voting power in the hands of his parent company ; a snug little family arrangement  --  the only safe way nowadays , for nothing involved so much danger to a corporation as to have its administration become a matter of stock market conflict and manipulation . Jed would make his reputation with the investing public , they would know him as a sound administrator , and would be content to leave the conduct of the properties in his hands . The velvety phrases of the Jewish lawyer caressed Jed so that he felt like a cat before a warm stove . The oil business was somewhat overdeveloped , but the weaker concerns would be forced to the wall , and the stronger would win out in the end . Jed would be among these , for he had many advantages . With the Tar-bucket gusher properly exploited in the press , there was no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would be desirable to spend quite a bit of money among the newspapers , said the lawyer ; a small amount paid directly to financial writers would often help more than a lot of advertising . The brokers would know all about that , of course . Mr. Rusher would wish to limit the amount of profits the investors would get  --  so the sympathetic lawyer went on to suggest . That was the wonderful thing about this lawyer  --  he did all the dirty work ; he made the greedy suggestions , and enabled Jed to remain the righteous church member , forced to do things which were the custom in a highly competitive world . There was no sense in giving to others the benefit of **26;355;TOOLONG Vila 's ship , and Perez , Vizcaino , Gomez and one of the sailors promptly clambered over the ship 's side as best they could . Once aboard , they gazed with horror upon the scene . Scattered about the ship on cots or in hammocks were thirty or more soldiers and sailors , most of them suffering from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some had died and had been buried at sea , many others were dying , and even those who had so far escaped the deadly malady looked like living skeletons , who moved about in jerky , slowly dragging steps of complete and utter exhaustion . It was a ghastly sight to see those shivering and helpless young men , as most of them were , some gasping for breath , others voicing their sufferings aloud , while those whose hours were nearing the end merely mumbledinaudible words  --  a message , perhaps , intended for a mother , a wife or a sweetheart  --  as they endeavored to raise their eyes to meet those of the beloved Father Parron , whose only thought was to serve with cheeringwords , or offer up a prayer for their eternal salvation , or touch the lips of those who lay unconscious with his cross as a blessed benediction . Presently they met Dr. Prat , who was slowly recoveringfrom an attack of dysentery . He gave little thought to his own illness , but like all those who were ill , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a time failed to recognize him . He had been going from patient to patient , followed by . a servant bearing a large tray . He always greeted his patients with a few kind words , and afterp101counting their pulse beats he would , if they were sufferingfrom scurvy , first wash the blood from their bleeding gums , then urge them to eat some easily masticated food that might strengthen them and mayhaplengthen their lives . The doctor 's medicines had long since given out , but what his patients really needed were fresh vegetablesand some lemon juice to effect a cure . But even without them , he knew that some would recover . After visiting some of the patients with the doctor , Vizcaino asked him , " When do you sleep , Doctor ? " " Sleep ? I do n't know . Sometimes , as I sit beside a patient , I fall asleep , and they may let me rest undisturbedfor a few minutes , or even an hour or two , until I am needed elsewhere , when the touch of a hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It has been like this for many weeks , but , thank God , we are now in San Diego , and in a few days I will be able to go out into the hills to find the herbs I need to replenish my medicine chest . Then I 'll be able to get a full night 's sleep . " " I sincerely hope you may , Doctor . " Captain Perez had no time to visit the sick . He wanted to know what had caused the delay of the San Carlos , and he promptly went in search of Captain Vila . He found him in the kitchen , where , after a strenuous day 's work , he was eating his evening meal . Perez was invited to join him . " Our delay , " said Vila , " was caused by heavy storms that drove my ship more than two hundred leagues out into the ocean . This circumstance , and leaky water casks , and mind you we had taken over thirty-eight hundred gallons of fresh water aboard before sailing from La Paz @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my water supply . Unfortunately , the water we found there proved unwholesome , and it may have had something to do with bringing on the attack of scurvy . Dr. Prat , however , does not think so , but he believes it has caused some dysentery , and its weakening effects , no doubt , made our men easy victims of the more serious malady . Another protracted delay was due to Galvez 's instructions to me . He ordered me to sail as far north as thirty-four degrees , then stand inshore and sail southwarduntil we located the port of San Diego . " " I was ordered to do likewise , " said Captain Perez , " and by my reckoning I found that the latitude of San Diego is about thirty-two degrees and forty minutes . " " I believe that is about right , Perez . Now you have full knowledge as to what caused our delay , but I might add that we could have made better time if we had had enough men to man the ship . At present I have just four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it had not been for the help and assistance of Senor Costanso and Lieutenant Fages and a few of his soldiers , I doubt if we would have been able to reach San Diego . " " You certainly have had a run of hard luck , Captain . Now , if it is agreeable to you , I 'll send over some of my men and we will move the San Carlos nearerp103to our landing , and in the morning we will help you transfer your helpless men ashore , which I presume you will want to do ? " " Yes , indeed , Perez , and it was very kind of you to make the suggestion , and on behalf of myself and my crippled crew I sincerely thank you . Before you go , Captain , tell me what you know about the land ex-peditions . " " I came near forgetting to tell you about them . Both are gradually nearing San Diego . Captain Portolasent a courier from Loreto , Corporal Rocha , and in his despatches he has ordered us to remain in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who sends his greetings to both of us by the same courier , says he expects to reach San Diego by the middle of May . " " That is news , indeed , and it suits me . " The next day sails were stripped from the San Carlos and utilized for tents , and the doctor 's patients transferred from ship to shore and made as cornfortableas possible . It was a sad spectacle to see so many brave soldiers and sailors stretched out on these quickly improvised cots , fighting for breath , as the ( ; rim Reaper hovered over them . Their high hopes of glory and renown crashed to a figment.  |p104Serra  Joins Portola AFTER leaving the mission San Borja , Serra decided to stop over at the old mission Calomofue , also known as Calagnujuet by the Jesuits . The location was picturesque , but the soil was very poor and the water unfit to drink . Therefore , it had to be abandoned . In describing the place , Serra said : " All that was left of the deserted church was a ruinous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians , and , it being Sunday , I celebrated Mass for them and delivered a short sermon . On the following day I arrived at mission Santa Maria . Here I came up with Governor Portola and Father Campa . " Serra was heartily welcomed by the governor and all the members of the expedition , as few had thought it possible that he would be able to make the long journey from Loreto . All noticed , however , that the father was still suffering from his ulcerated leg , and that only his indomitable will had kept him going . After all the suffering he had endured , it would have been natural for one in his condition to seek as much rest as possible , but knowing that the abandonment of the Santa Maria mission was under consideration , which , if carried out , would cause much unhappinessp105to the Indian neophytes belonging to the mission , Father Serra decided to make a thorough investigation of the conditions surrounding the place and see for himself if it was absolutely necessary to abandon this popular site . Early @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father de la Campa , Governor Portola and the soldier guard of the mission , Bernal Salgado , he made a most careful inspection of the arable lands , the water supply and other essential needs for a mission . Serra was so well pleased with what he saw that he was opposed to its abandonment , and by letters so informed His Excellency Don Joseph de Galvez , the inspector-general , and the newly appointed Father President of the Lower Californiamissions , Father Francisco Palou . On the morning of May eleventh , Captain Portola , Fathers Serra and Campa , accompanied by a number of soldiers and a few of the neophytes , left Santa Maria de Los Angeles for Velicata , which place they reached on the thirteenth , and on the following day Serra dedicated the new mission San Fernando de Velicata . He was assisted in his work by Father Campa , Captain Portola and many of the soldiers and Indian neophytes who had come up with the second overland expedition . Before completing the ceremoniesFather de la Campa was fittingly installed by Father Serra , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the Franciscans in Lower California . Captain Portola , Father Serra , Sergeant Ortega and the other members of the expedition left Velicata the next day , and on reaching a place known as San Juan de Dios they camped there for the night . At this time Serra 's leg caused him such intense pain that Portola proposed sending the father back to Velicata , but the latter refused to return , firmly believing that God would so strengthen him as to make it possible for him to go on . Portola could not but admire Father Serra 's courage , and , to make his traveling less painful , he ordered a litter to be made on which Serra could easily be carried from camp to camp by the neophytes . This greatly disturbed Father Serra when he heard of it , and he asked his servant to call Juan Antonio Coronel , the head muleteer . When he came in , Father Serra said to him , " Juan , my son , could you prepare some remedy for my sore leg ? " " I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cured the wounds of animals only . " " Well , my son , imagine that I am an animal and that it is one of their wounds that has caused this swelling , and prepare for it the same remedy you would apply to one of your animals . " " This I will do , Father , if you insist . " " Then do it , my son . " The muleteer soon returned , applied the mixture , skillfully bandaged Father Serra 's leg , and advised him to keep off his feet until the next day . As Coronel finished his work , Serra rested his hand on his head and said , " Arise Surgeon Juan Antoniop107Coronel , and as such I greet you and sincerely thank you , my good friend . " Strangely enough , the treatment proved efficacious , and the next morning Serra was able to continue on his travels with the Portola expedition , once more on the way to San Diego , and the litter was left behind . From that day Serra 's condition seemed to improve @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he might reach Alta California had been answered.  |p108The  Two Overland ExpeditionsReach San Diego C APTAIN RIVERA , with his army of occupation , was slowly wending his way northward toward the goal that had been selected as a site for the first mission in Alta California . There were still many problems for Rivera to puzzle over before reachinghis destination . Lately his men had been cut down to half rations , and on several occasions there was a shortage of good drinking water , and a lack of fodder for his animals  --  petty trials that must be endured , but often likely to break down the morale of an army . Although Rivera was nearing the end of his long overland journey , his troubles were not yet over . Duringthe eight days or more preceding this time he had been harassed by numerous bands of savages following along the trail of the expedition . Natural curiosity no doubt impelled most of them to follow . They did not know what to make of this singular spectacle . Never before had they seen such a cavalcade of abnormal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horses , mules or herds of cattle . Where had these strange individualscome from and whither were they bound ? From time to time some of the more daring savages wouldp 109fire arrows at them , but Captain Rivera ordered his men to pay no attention to them , as their arrows all fell short ; but when his sergeant reported that a band of a hundred or more was trying to close in on them , he ordered a dozen of his soldiers to go after them . They did . It was a real battle , short and full of dash . It was all over in ten minutes . Two of the soldiers were slightly wounded . No one knew nor cared what happened to the savages . It was all a part of the day 's work , and Rivera kept on going . Finally on Sunday , May 14 , 1769 , Captain Rivera and the members of his expedition , after being seven and a half months on the way from Santa Ana , Lower California , reached San Diego , and were heartily welcomed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Father Crespi were shocked when they learned of the great misfortune that had overtakenthe San Carlos since leaving La Paz , and horrifiedwhen they learned how many of the sailors and soldiers had died , and how many more were still seriouslyill . It was an overwhelming tragedy , and the end was not yet . It seems that Galvez had handed Lieutenant Pedro Fages certain instructions before he left La Paz , on the 9th of January . These were to the effect that Fages was to be the military chief of the sea expedition , and was to exercise the same authority on land pending the arrival of Governor Portola ; that he was to be Captain Rivera 's superior , etc . If Rivera had not arrived ( in advance of Fages ) , Fages was authorized to erect some buildings and thus prepare for the coming of Rivera . Due to the stricken condition of the soldiers and sailors that had come up on both the San Carlos and San flntonio , virtually nothing had been done , so it devolved on Rivera and his men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the buildings . To avoid any trouble , Lieutenant Fages called a conferenceof all the officials and many important matters were discussed . Among those who attended the meeting were Captains Rivera , Vila and Perez , Lieutenant Fages , Miguel Costanso , Jose Canizares , Dr. Prat , and Fathers Crespi , Vizcaino , Gomez and Parron . Captain Rivera , whose long military career made his advice valuable , declared that what was immediately needed were numerous corrals for all the animals , sheds for the cattle and necessary sleeping quarters for the soldiers . Also a plentiful supply of potable water for man and beast , and some grazing grounds . Dr. Prat made a request for additional quarters , either tents or brushwoodhuts , for his patients . These should be well built and well roofed over . Timber would he needed for the mission building , a storehouse and barracks to house the soldiers and laborers . It was then agreed that Senores Costanso and Canizares , with a guard of six soldiers , should explore the surrounding country , with a view of locating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would be needed to supply the mission and outlying buildings . They were also to locate some timber lands as close in as possible . It was also agreed that the mis/sion fathers should jointly select a suitable site for the San Diego Mission building and the ground cleared off , all to be subject to Serra 's approval . In the meantime , a roadway was cleared off and leveled . Captain Rivera , with the necessary help , erected temporary cabins of brushwood or tules , to be replaced later with adobe structures . No time was lost in carrying out this program . The first thing considered was Dr. Prat 's patients . They must be made comfortable , and the first building erected by Rivera was for their use . A second courier arrived in San Diego on the twentyfifthof June with despatches from Portola for Rivera and Fages . In these communications Portola stated , " We expect to reach San Diego with a part of our expedition on the twenty-ninth of June , and the balance , including the pack train , should reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have been making splendid headway , due largely to the roads that were opened up by Rivera 's expedition . We were annoyed somewhat , during the past ten days , by the natives . One of our soldiers and three or four savages were slightly wounded in a skirmish we had with them a few days ago . The savages got more than they bargained for , and , as far as I know , they are still on the run . " Father Serra joined us at Santa Maria and traveled ahead with me to Velicata , where he dedicated a new mission . A messenger , sent on here by Father de la Camp , who was placed in charge of the new mission , informed Serra that thirty-two of the natives in that vicinity called on the father , since the mission 's dedica/tion , stating that they desired to become Christians . ' We were all pleased to get this information . " Shortly after leaving Velicata , Father Serra 's leg became so seriously inflamed that I suggested he return south to recuperate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I believed his death imminent . Strange to say , a few days later his leg was virtually cured by a liniment applied to it by my head muleteer . Some of my men consider it a miracle , but Father Serra gives full credit to my muleteer , who is now called Doctor or Surgeon Coronel . " While the interesting news received from Captain Portola was enlightening and cheerful , San Diego was not in the happiest of moods when the time came to celebrate the advent of their commander-in-chief . Every day the scurvy had taken its death toll , and how many more were to pass over into the great beyond beforethat terrible malady had run its course none dared to predict . The missionary fathers gave nearly all their time to caring for the sick and dying , while poor Dr. Prat was at his wits ' end and knew not what to do or where to turn for the supplies he so sorely needed to aid the helpless victims . However , for one day at least they were all striving to forget about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young men who had come from far-away Spain to take possession of Alta California . It was Lieutenant Fages who insisted that every man that was half-way able to mount a horse should join the cavalcade that was to ride out to meet and welcomep113their beloved commander , Captain Portola , and escort him to San Diego . Everyone was dressed in holiday attire , and as Portola , accompanied by some of his soldiers and half a dozen Indian neophytes , was seen advancing toward them , they fired off their muskets and wildly cheered him . The padres , too , had come out to greet him , but they were disappointed when they saw that their dear Father President Junipero Serra was not with the company . The coming of Captain Portola was an epochal event , and he and his brave followers deserved the rousing welcome given them . Of course , there was a lot of hand-shaking and embracing , while the savages , from many vantage points , looked on and wondered what it was all about . When , on the procession 's final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional firing of more musket and can not shots , the natives hastily scattered and kept in hiding for some time . Two days later Father Serra , Sergeant Jose Ortega with a dozen or more soldiers , the muleteers with their pack train , headed by Juan Antonio Coronel , followed by the neophyte Indians , laborers and servants , arrived in San Diego . While their welcome was not so noisy as that accorded Captain Portola and his followers , it was fully as sincere . Everyone was happy to have Father Serra with them again , and to learn that he was none the worse for his long overland journey from I . oreto . It was a great shock to Serra , as it had been to Por- tola and Rivera , when he learned how many of the soldiers and sailors had died of scurvy and dysentery , and the large number still sick or convalescing . After he had met and been greeted by everyone , the first thing that Serra did was to visit the sick patients at the hospital with the other Franciscan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he knew that some among them were not likely to recover . Nevertheless , even the weakest among the patients were heartened by the presence of the father , and his comforting words and the gentle touch of his hand brought smiles and tears as well , to the bedridden sailors and soldiers . Just what effect the scurvy epidemic was to have on Galvez 's plans for the spiritual and physical conquest of Alta California had not yet been considered . It was a serious problem . That evening , after the five missionaries had finished their supper , they entertained each other by recounting their experiences since leaving Lower California . Of them all Father Parron had the saddest story to tell . Those of Fathers Vizcaino and Gomez were the least interesting , as good fortune had followed in the wake of the San Antonio , and barring the death of two sailors during her voyage to San Diego , there was really nothing worth while to talk about . Father Crespi 's pilgrimage with Captain Rivera 's expedition was interesting , and his description of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It is up to you now , Father Serra , and we are all anxious to hear your story , " said Father Crespi.  | " There is much of it you are already familiar with , if you have received and read the letters Corporal Rocha delivered to you , and what personal information he gave you up to the time of Portola 's departure from Loreto . Since then I forwarded two long letters to Brother Crespi , of the contents of which you have no doubt been informed . In my last letter , that Governor Portola was to forward with some of his despatches about ten days ago , I gave you a succinct account of my journey after leaving Loreto up to the time of the dedication of our new mission at Velicata . " " Your letter was promptly delivered to me and we all enjoyed your many interesting remarks . In fact , I think every one of us read it over several times , " said Father Crespi , " and there was a postscript added to your letter at San @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ muleteer named Juan Antonio Coronel cured your sore leg , which we all thought the most interesting item in the whole letter . " " I remember adding it to my letter , and I shall never forget how kind and helpful he was to me . The followingsix weeks I shall always count among the happiest of my life . I had prayed to our dear Lord God to give me strength to reach San Diego , and my prayer was answered . My feelings were indescribable . Some day I may be able to tell you more about this . " On the twenty-eighth of May our troops had a bloody encounter with about forty aggressive savages . I t did not last long . During the day very many Indians , all naked , followed us to the halting-place . Until then we had seen no women among them , nor did I desire to see them , because I feared they went naked like the men , but in that I was mistaken , as two women came along presently , talking as efficaciously as this sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decently covered that we could take it in good part if greater nudities were never seen among the Christian women of the missions . " The next day 's journey was only three hours , but most painful , for all of it was through hills , ascents , descents , all slopes of earth , but steep and wearisome . At last we descended to the plain , and the hardships could be well endured because of the excellence of the stopping-place , equal to which we have seen none so far . " Great crowds of Indians were occasionally encounteredthe nearer the expedition approached San Diego . I presume , Brother Crespi , you also noticed this on your way here with Captain Rivera . " " Yes , indeed , I did , " Crespi replied , " and I believe Captain Rivera had a bloody fight with the same band of savages who attacked Portola 's soldiers . Corporal Rocha also mentioned he was followed one day by a very aggressive band of savages , just as it was getting dark , but he kept on going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days ago , " Serra continued , " I noticed that more and more pagan men , women and children gathered about us in such large numbers that I did not count them . They wanted us to give them everything they saw . They even asked me for my habit . The gov/ernor they begged for his leather jacket , waistcoat , breeches , and all he had on . Oh , you may laugh , brothers . I , too , can see its funny side now . They even botheredme enough to give them my spectacles . I took them off for one whose actions seemed to signify that I should lend them to him to see what they were , but God knows what it cost me to recover them after they had been in the hands of women who hankered for them . " It was probably the droll way in which Serra told this story that caused the other brothers to burst out in loud guffaws , and , as their noisy laughter subsided somewhat , one of the friars could not refrain from remarking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " But not a laughing one to me , at the time , " Father Serra good-naturedly responded.  |p118An  Important ConferenceSERIOUS situation confronted Captain Portola , Hl who , as commander-in-chief of both the landand sea expeditions , would have to decide upon what steps to take as to all future movements . As a wise precaution , however , he decided to invite not only the military and naval officers but the five missionaries as well , to a conference to be held at his headquarters . Among those present were Captain Rivera , Lieutenant Fages , Captains Vila and Perez , Sergeant Ortega , Miguel Costanso , Jose Canizares , Dr. Prat and Fathers Serra and Vizcaino . The three other missionarieswere caring for the sick and could not attend . Captain Portola gave them a resume of the objects of the expeditions , and recounted the many handicaps that were likely to retard them in their efforts to carry out Inspector-General Galvez 's instructions . " The question uppermost in my mind , " said Portola , " is whether we should return to Lower California or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against this question was unnecessary , as everyone at the meeting shouted , " We must go on to Monterey ! " " That is just what I thought you would say , and I feel that way about it myself ; but here is what we willp119have to contend against : We are short of supplies and short of men , and it is absolutely necessary to send one of the ships back to San Blas to bring up the supplies we need , and the sailors and soldiers required to replacethose who have died . But Captain Vila tells me that there are not enough sailors left to man even one of the ships . " " I beg your pardon , Governor , I said to properly man one of our ships . I have talked this matter over with Captain Perez , and he thought that with three of the five sailors I have left on the San Carlos , and six that he can safely rely upon on his own ship , with his two mates and himself , he would undertake to make his way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Captain Perez ? " Portola asked him . " I believe that I can do it , Captain . I was shorthandedwhen I started north from Cape San Lucas , and I managed to get along . In sailing south I am likely to he favored with strong northwest winds that will help to make up for the shortage . " " You are a brave seaman , Captain Perez , and I admireyour courage and daring . When can you start south , Captain ? " " Hardly before the ninth , Governor ; I want to give my ship a good overhauling before I leave , and two of my ablest seamen are still in the hospital , but Dr. Prat says they will be allowed to leave in three or four days . " " All right , Perez , we will make it July ninth . I will have lists made up as to what supplies we need , and send word through you to Don Jose de Galvez and the quartermaster of the royal warehouses at San Blas . " " You can count on me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considered is our departure for Monterey . As some of you may have heard , Galvez'splan called for a third ship , the San Jose , to be fitted out from San Blas with additional supplies for us . He notified me that the San Jose would sail direct to the port of Monterey , and the ship may be there now awaiting our arrival . My own instructions were to continue on to the same port , so I have set July fourteenthas the day for our departure , unless anyone here can offer some good reason for an earlier or later date . There will be many things to talk over and a lot of work to do before we can leave for the north , and I know I can rely upon you to do your share of the work , so that Captain Perez can sail for San Blas next Sunday , and we may be able to start off the following Friday for Monterey . That is all for this morning , gentlemen . " No mention had been made about the dedication of the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many duties , had been quietly completing arrangements for the planting and raising of the cross , which was to be followed by the founding of the San Diego mission de Alcala . This was to take place on the date he had set , Sunday , July 16 , 1769 . Serra was grievously disappointedthat Captain Portola and his men would not be able to wait over for the dedication , but under exist/ing circumstances Portola was justified in leaving two days before the time set for the long anticipated ceremony . The site for the first California mission had been unanimously approved , and afforded an excellent view of the bay , ocean and surrounding country , but constructionwork on the permanent mission building was deferred and a brushwood structure temporarily devised . In the meantime the father had plenty to do . For some reason or other the pagan Indians in the San Diego region held aloof and showed very little interest in what was going on . From time to time the missionariesurged them to come nearer , and tempted by the presents of colored glass beads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloth , some did come closer , but they could not persuade any of them to accept the food that was offered , as the savages believed it was the food the white faces had been eating that caused the death of so many of the sailors and soldiers . It was not an inept assumption . Following Captain Portola 's arrival in San Diego , changes had been made to provide better accommodationsfor the scurvy patients . A much larger tent had been erected for their use , and commodious tents or huts had been set up for the use of Dr. Prat and the Franciscan friars , all located within a short distance of the hospital . Another large tent had been set up for Portola 's headquarters , where all business was transacted . It wasp122a busy place . At one table Sergeant Ortega was hurriedlypreparing duplicated lists of " supplies wanted , " which were to be forwarded to the officer in charge of the royal warehouses at San Blas . At another table Jose Tapis , a Catalonian soldier and private secretary to the governor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . As Captain Vila passed out of the tent , Fages and Rivera were seen to enter . They wanted to check over the lists Ortega had been working on . Fages , convalescing from an attack of scurvy , still looked somewhat emaciated , but was gradually regaining his health . He was anxious to get away , as he believed the journey to Monterey would benefit him . After the departure of Rivera and Fages , Portola came in , and as he watched Tapis fold and seal a number of his letters and papers , he asked him , " Jose , have you finished my letters to Galvez and the Marquis de Croix ? " " Yes , Your Excellency , and if you care to look them over , here they are , all ready to be sealed . " Tapis handed the letters over to Portola , and kept on with his work . After Portola read the two letters , he handed them back to Tapis and said , " They read all right and you may seal them . When you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go with me , Jose , to see Captain Perez . " Portola then walked over to where Sergeant Ortega was at work , and asked him , " How near are you ready with the requisitions , Sergeant ? "  | " In about two hours I 'll be able to submit them to Your Excellency , " Ortega replied . " Very well , Sergeant , I 'll stop in later and we can go over the lists together . Are you ready , Tapis ? " " Ready , Your Excellency , " Tapis replied , and both left for a visit to Captain Perez of the San Antonio . Almost immediately after the departure of Portola and Tapis , Corporal Rocha entered the tent . Sergeant Ortega was surprised to see him , as he had heard that Juan had been temporarily relieved from duty on account of illness . They saluted each other , and Ortega , after having asked Juan to be seated , said : " What can I do for you , Corporal ? " Juan was both nervous and worried , but , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he quickly came to the point and said , " Sergeant , you have known for some time that I have thought a great deal of your sister , Senorita Ortega , but you opposed my paying her any attention , going so far even as to threaten my life . I cared very little about that , but the fact that you have resented my paying her any attention has caused both of us a great deal of suffering and annoyance and brought about an intolerable situation . " Ortega started to speak , but Juan , raising his hand , stopped him , and continued , " I beg of you , Sergeant , let me finish what I have to say . You may not have known or realized it , Sergeant , but Camila  --  " Ortega interrupted , " Senorita Ortega , if you please . " " Be it so , Sergeant , but your sister , Senorita Ortega , and I love each other dearly , and realizing that my enforced absence in Upper California might separate us for a long time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . " Juan broke down as he said this and buried his head in his hands . Ortega , unable to grasp such a possibility , looked upon Juan with amazement . Then , stirred by the fear of its being true and of its terrible consequences , he jumped up from his seat and , grabbing Juan with both hands , pulled him up on his feet , swung him around and said , " My God , man , you do n't mean to tell me that you got my sister , Camila , to elope with you ? It ca n't be possible , man . You lie , you lie . " " No , Sergeant , it is the truth . I know I did wrong in urging your sister to join me . Unintentionally , I took advantage of her great love for me  --  do n't misinterpretmy meaning  --  and in doing so , we have both suffereduntold agony . " " By what contemptible means did you manage to bring about this dastardly outrage ? " " While I can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean to harm your sister . You may remember the day , Sergeant , when Captain Portola ordered me to carry dispatches to Rivera and the ship captains at San Diego . Early that morning I met your sister and asked her to be my wife . She agreed , but knowing you would not give your consent , we decided to keep our betrothal a secret . Together we entered the Mission church and kneeling before the altar we vowed to be true to each other . As we were leaving Father Serra came in . Kneeling before him we asked his blessing . Asp125we were about to part , your sister whispered to me , We will have dear Father Serra perform the marriage ceremony . ' I did not know when we would meet again . " " I certainly will not give my consent . She is not only too young , but I have other plans for her . However , all this does not explain by what trickery you accomplishedthis reprehensible act . " " That is the saddest part of all , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kill me for having obtained your sister 's consent to join me by a ruse . " Breaking under the nervous strain , Juan cried out : " Why , why did I ever do it  --  bear with me for a moment . When I learned that I was to leave for San Diego ahead of the expedition I sent your sister a note asking her to meet me at our trysting place on the way to the Zarate ranch . She agreed . " After hurriedly obtaining necessary supplies , detailedinstructions and the dispatches , I started north with Ignacio , the Indian neophyte . After passing the confines of the presidio I rode on ahead . Your sister soon joined me . I told her my plans . There were objections , but I finally gained her consent to go with me , disguised as an Indian lad . I suggested immediate marriage , but she refused either from fear of you or lackingyour sanction . I also suggested that Senora Zarate go with us , but that was impossible . " From the day when your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most unhappy man . Gradually , as we traveled northward , your sister became restless and ill at ease . At night the howling of wild beasts dis- turbed her rest and the fear of an Indian attack preyed upon her mind . Loss of appetite sapped her strength , and there were fainting spells that frightened me . " Deeply distressed by Rocha 's recital , Ortega , ventinghis feelings , said , " My dear Camilita , what a terribletime you must have had . How much better it would have been if I had kept you at the convent school . Poor Camilita . " " There is not much more to tell you , Sergeant . Fear urged me on . I was anxious to reach San Diego where I hoped to find Dr. Prat aboard the San Carlos . Instead I found the San Antonio anchored near the shore . I met Captain Perez and Father Vizcaino . I told the father of my distress and your sister 's serious condition . A kinder man never lived . When he saw your sister , tears @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delirious for days , the soft tones of the father 's voice soon quieted her . Both he and Dr. Prat , who is now attending her , say she has brain fever . " In her delirium , " Juan continued , " she frequently speaks of your kindness to her as a little girl and how you tried to be both father and mother to her , and then as she grows restless , tells of your threatening to kill me , to lock her up , or send her back to the convent school . Dr. Prat believes that her fear of you , and her thinking of those threats , our elopement and the hardshipsof the long journey caused her illness , and I  --  I  --  may God forgive me  --  have been to blame for it all . At night as I sit by her side , listening to her as she repeats over and over again the things that havep127troubled her , her fear for my life , or a possible attack by the savages , or wild beasts , that so frequently disturbedher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep back my tears . I can not eat  --  I can not sleep  --  and every hour in the day comes the fear that she might die . I try not to think of that , but if it should happen  --  " Father Serra and Dr. Prat entered the tent just then and interrupted Juan 's speech . It was Serra who had urged Juan to see Ortega and tell him of all that had happened . There were many important matters to considerregarding Camila 's care during the absence of Sergeant Ortega and Corporal Rocha , as both were to go north with Captain Portola . It was to talk this matter over that Father Serra advised holding a joint meeting with Ortega and Rocha . Dr. Prat suggested that a cabin be built near those occupied by the missionaries and himself , and that it be large enough to house both Camila and Ignacioand Marta , his wife , who was to act as nurse . Sergeant Ortega was also to arrange matters so that Ignacio would be allowed to remain at San Diego instead of going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serra assured Ortega and Juan that they would do everything possible for Camila while they were gone , and , with Marta in attendance , they would not need to feel uneasy . Ortega asked Dr. Prat 's opinion as to the outcome of Camila 's condition and he said , " I believe that Camilais going to get well , but it may be many months hr fore she will be able to leave her bed . The equable climate we have here , and her enforced rest , I feel certain , will help to effect a cure , provided , of course , that nothing else happens to impair her vitality . " " Would it be possible , Doctor , for me to see my sisterbefore I leave for the north ? " " I should advise against it , Sergeant . She is very weak and any unusual excitement might prove fatal to your sister in her present condition . " The departure of the San Antonio for San Blas on July ninth was a sad blow to Captain Vila of the San Carlos . To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his ship into one of the newly constructed cabins , close to the bay shore . As the place would afford him a fine view of the bay and ocean , and he would be in closer touch with Dr. Prat , Jose Canizaresand the missionaries , who were to remain in San Diego , he thought he would try it , but following the departure of Portola , Vila would frequently return to his ship , where he felt more at home and could do as he pleased . On board the ship at that time were two sailors and two boys , convalescing . The savages , aware that the San Carlos was virtuallydeserted , decided , out of idle curiosity , to row out to the ship in their tule canoes . As nobody was about they helped themselves to such articles as pleased their fancy . When Portola heard of this act of piracy , he detailed two soldiers to serve as guards on board the ship , thesep129to be changed from time to time while the San Carlos remained in the harbor . What Captain Vila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long he would have to remain in San Diego waiting for the coming of the sailors needed to man his ship , and who would enable him to leave for Monterey . He knew it was going to be a long and monotonous wait , and to make it less tiresome he mapped out a daily program for himself and his men to follow , which was to be strictly adhered to by everyone . A few days more would see the departure of Captain Portola and his men for their long overland march to Monterey . Then those who were to remain in San Diego would settle down to a more or less humdrum life.  |p130California  's First Mission B EFORE a partially completed brushwood structure , which was to be dedicated on the following Sunday by Father Serra , as San Diego 's first mission , a short service was held on Friday , July 14 , 1769 . A Mass was sung , in which Serra was assisted by Fathers Crespi , Vizcaino , Gomez and Parron . Among those present at the ceremony were Captains Portola , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miguel Costanso , Jose Canizares , Juan EstevanRocha and virtually all of the soldiers and Indian neophytes who were well enough to attend . Father Serra , after a short talk to the men , asked them all to kneel as he prayed for those who were to leave for Monterey . A high wind was blowing in from the ocean , which assured the members of the San Diego-Monterey expeditiona cool and comfortable day as they started their northward march along the roadway that was subsequentlydesignated as El Camino Real ( the King 's Highway ) . Riding at the head of the troops were Captain Portola , Captain Rivera and Lieutenant Fages . Following the soldiers came Fathers Crespi and Gomez , then the Indian neophytes with a few stragglingsoldiers , back of them the pack train in charge ofp113the muleteers , and , bringing up the rear , were Sergean Ortega , Corporal Rocha and two other soldiers . The handful of soldiers , sailors , laborers and India , neophytes left at San Diego to aid and assist in caring for the mission property , help in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and guard the lives o the mission fathers , deeply regretted seeing their friends and former companions leaving them . As the passed out of sight , a farewell salute was fired anc those left behind returned to their duties . The two months ' old town site of San Diego , follow ing the departure of Portola and his men , was in deplorable condition . There were still a number of bed ridden sailors and soldiers suffering from scurvy , anc Surgeon Prat and Fathers Serra , . Vizcaino and Parrot were kept busy day and night , in caring for the sick anc ( lying . The serious situation that existed in San Diego no doubt caused Captain Portola to leave so hurriedly for the north . The many deaths weighed heavily upor everyone , and he was probably afraid that if he did no start at once , he might not be able to start at all . Portola knew Father Serra would be deeply hur because of his leaving just two days prior to the dedica tion of the first of the California missions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his duty to go on There was still another reason for his hurried depar tore . Portola was anxious to reach Monterey as earl as possible , so that he might complete the work he had been ordered to do , then turn over his troops and hi authority , in accordance with his instructions , to LieutenantFages . He would then be free to return to Mexico . The total number of Christian inhabitants left in San Diego after Portola started north amounted to less than fifty people , possibly less than forty , though the exact number has never been stated . Included among the inhabitants were Fathers Serra , Vizcaino and Parron ; Dr. Pedro Prat ; Jose Canizares ; eight leatherjacketsoldiers and the same number of neophytes from Baja California ; one carpenter , one blacksmith and one servant . On the San Carlos there were two sailors , two boys and Captain Vila . In addition there were many helpless sick , including Camila Ortega . Before the end of the year there were many additional deaths . The dedication of California 's first mission was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the members of his expedition could have taken part in the ceremonies . However , this did not deter Father Serra from carrying out his program , and early on Sunday morning , July 16 , 1769 , he blessed the cross that had been planted in front of the chapel , after which he sang a high Mass and delivered a fervent address to the little company present . Its first missionaries were Fathers Junipero Serra and Fernando Parron . All that was now needed to complete Serra 's happiness was the approach of the natives seeking conversion . Camila , in a comfortable litter , was carried to the newly constructed brushwood cabin where she could bep133given better care , - attention and protection . Dr. Pr had promptly diagnosed her trouble as brain fever , ar while he was hopeful of her recovery , he knew it wou take months to restore her to good health , and th. much would depend on good nursing and cheerful su roundings . The cabin was quite a large one and had tvi separate compartments , which made it possible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Camila consta attention . With the help of her husband , who was pe mitted to remain in San Diego , and following tl advice of r . Prat , Juan 's betrothed would certain be well lo lid after . In case of an emergency , Mari or Ignacio could call Dr. Prat or one of the Francisco fathers to lend a helping hand , if necessary , as the were all within hailing distance.  |p134Portola  Fails to Find MontereyS Captain Portola and the members of the Montereyexpedition traveled northward , they wereagreeably surprised to find that the savages they met from day to day were more congenial than those living in the San Diego Bay region . Whether this was due to climatic conditions or merely natural perversity has never been established . That there was a difference could not be gainsaid . After leaving the San Fernando Valley the expeditiongradually made its way to the coast , and it was in the Ventura-Santa Barbara region that Portola and his men first came in contact with a new type of the California Indian . There they found most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white faces . Wherever the expeditioncamped for the night it was visited by a vast number of the natives , nor did they come emptyhanded . The savages gave freely of all they had . Captain Portola , not wanting to be outdone by the generosity of the savages , and as they still had a goodly supply of knickknacks on hand , ordered that the visitors be given glass beads , ribbons and other trinkets . The Indians frequently entertained the newcomerswith their singing and dancing , and in everyp 135way tried to show that they were friendly to th travelers . In this section of the territory the men were know as boat-builders , and with nothing more than a flint ( they had no metals ) they fashioned serviceable boat capable of carrying as many as ten persons . These the navigated with long , sweeping paddles , and their fist ermen frequently ventu far out to sea . Their wome excelled in the weaving fine-baskets and in the mat ing of elaborate fur garments . While it was true that the overland journey fror San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serious problems that th explorers had to overcome . Father Crespi , in referring , to the roads , rivers , creeks , sand dunes and marshes that the Portola expedition had to travel over , lef this interesting description : " Continuing along th shore , the pioneers were every little while obliged t , repair many bad places , which troublesome wort caused much delay . . . . On September 20 we brok camp and immediately began to climb another high mountain , and on the top we appeared to haveview of the whole Sierra . This was a sad spectacle fo poor wanderers , tired and exhausted from the hard ships of such a march full of obstacles , which require ) filling up marshes , the opening up of roads through mountains and forests , sand dunes and swamps . " All this , naturally , delayed them and limited thei travel to less than three leagues a day . In additior quite a number of the soldiers were stricken wit scurvy , and , for a time , about twenty of them had to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called tijeras in Spanish ) that were fitted on the backs of the mules and the invalid tied to it , to keep him from falling off . All this caused additional delay . Finally on October 1 , 1769 , after following down along the Salinas River , the expedition again came within sight of the ocean and an open hay , and near there they expected to find the port of Monterey . Ever since Sebastian Vizcaino anchored in the Bay of Monterey on December 16 , 1602 , that port had been spoken of in connection with Spanish activities in New Spain and the Californias . Vizcaino 's somewhat exaggerated report and description of the bay and the surrounding country had been widely commented upon . Naturally , Galvez was anxious that Spain should own and hold it against all comers , and to this end he ordered Portola to take possession of the port and territory in the name of Carlos III . Captain Portola was quite willing to carry out the orders of Galvez , but on the morning of October 2 , 1769 , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of Monterey . Very wisely , he ordered Captain Rivera to take Corporal Rocha and half a dozen soldiers to scout southward along the Pacific coast and see if they could locate the bay of Montereyand the expected supply ship , the San Jose . Rivera and his men returned late in the evening of the second day and reported they had not been able to locate either the ship or the harbor . P137The next day Portola called a council of his officers . " When all were assembled , " Father Crespi wrote in his diary , " he laid before them the lack of provisions , the many sick , the distance already traveled , all that the men , still able , suffered from the excessive burden of guarding the stock at night , having to perform sentinelduty , and continually making explorations and surveys . In view of what had been said , and that the port of Monterey had not been found , he wished each one to give his opinion freely , in order to determine what might be judged most expedient . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ continued as the only expedient that remained , in the hope , with the favor of God , of reachingthe desired port of Monterey and to find in it the packet-boat San Jose , which would relieve all necessities ; and that , should God permit that in search of Monterey all perished , we shall have complied with our duty to God and to men , while working together till death , for the success of the enterprise intrusted to us . With this all agreed , and all determined to continue the journey . We two religious ( Fathers Crespi and Gomez ) also attended the council , and we voted t he same way . " Before continuing their journey , however , Captain Potrtola ordered Sergeant Ortega with some of his men to examine the coast toward the north . They were gone two days , but failed to find either ship or harbor . The following day the expedition again started movingnorth and slightly westward and they kept on going , in a more or less hopeless way , until the eleventhday of November , when Portola @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fathers , Crespi and Gomez , and they unanimously agreed that the only thing left for them to do was to turn around and go back to Point Pinos , as , according to the observations taken that day , both by Father Crespi and Don Miguel Costanso , they must long since have passed the port of Monterey . However , their northward march was not altogetherbarren of results , as they discovered both the bay of San Francisco and the ocean inlet , afterward called the Golden Gate , but by that time their rationshad been cut down to five sickly looking pancakes(tortillas) a day , and a trifling thing like the discovery of the bay of San Francisco did n't mean anything to those half-starved men . Occasionally they would pass an Indian village , which afforded the men an opportunity to barter some of their souvenirs for some of the Indians ' black seeds and ground acorn meal with which to appease their hunger . The seeds were all right and they enjoyed eating them , but the acorn meal made them wish that they could turn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ monotony of their daily marches , hunting parties were frequently sent out , and on lucky days their scant larder was increased by the addition of a bear , some deer , antelope , ducks or wild geese . When a halt was made for a day 's rest , some of the soldiers would try their luck at fishing or clamming , P 139and in this , as well as in other ways , actual starvation was staved off . In the meantime , cold weather had set in the winter rains would frequently drench the men to the skin and thus add to their discomfort . On November 26 they reached their old camp-site , Santa Delfina ( so named by Father Crespi ) , near the mouth of the Salinas River , where they camped for the night . Early the next day they forded the river above tide water and selected their camp site for that night near a small inlet in full view of Point Pinos . Again they were facing the port of Monterey . Again they failed to recognize the long sought for harbor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ship , San Jose . On November 28 , they crossed the heavily wooded hills to the south and camped near Carmelo Bay . Portola then ordered Captain Rivera and some of his men to make a careful survey along the coast southwardfrom Point Pinos . In the meantime , the men in camp suffered exceedinglyfor want of food ; for neither game , nor fish , nor even clams could be obtained . Hunger drove the men to kill sea gulls and pelicans . Finally , a mule was slaughtered , but only the Catalonianvolunteers and the Indian neophytes would eat the flesh . As cold weather set in , the situation became desperate . Captain Rivera returned on December fourth and again reported that they had failed to locate any harbor , but learned that they were at the foot of a mountain range ( it was the Santa Luciap140Sierra ) which completely estopped any further advanceto the south . A final council meeting was called on December seventh . Sergeant Ortega reported supplies on hand , as follows : " Fourteen small sacks of flour and no meat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Lower California Indian neophytes had deserted , and that left only fifty-four men to feed . Some of the officers present at the meeting favored remaining at their present location until all the supplies had been consumed and depend on mule meat to supply their wants on the return journey , but the majority favored their immediate return to San Diego . Before leaving for the south the Portola expedition planted two large wooden crosses , one on a hillside near their camp at Carmelo Bay , and carved on this cross were the following words : " Dig at the base and thou wilt find a writing . " The writing was placed in a bottle and buried at the foot of the cross . The second cross was erected in a conspicuous place north of Point Pinos on the shore of the very harbor which they could not find , and carved thereon were these words : " The expedition for want of provisions returns by land to San Diego to-day . December 9 , 1769 . " The bottled note gave a short account of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 14 , 1769 ) up to December 9 , 1769 . In closing the note the writer said : " At last , undeceived and despairing of finding it ( Monterey Bay ) after so many hardships , surveys and anxieties , with no more pro/visions than fourteen sacks of flour , the expedition leaves this Ensenada ( Carmelo Bay ) for San Diego . Pray Almighty God to guide it ; and thou , navigator , may Divine Providence will to bring thee to the port of safety . " Ensenada de Pinos , December 9 , 1769 . That told the sad story in a few words . They still hoped that the ship San Jose might come along , and they wanted her captain to know what had become of the Portola expedition . On December tenth , Portola and his men left the Carmelo Bay district , crossed the pine-covered peninsula , again forded the Salinas River and continued moving along their self-established highwayback to San Diego . That Portola and his men failed to find the port of Monterey indubitably proved a blessing in disguise . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their return journey after having discovered the bay of San Francisco , they would in all likelihood have starved to death . Their fourteen small sacks of flour would not go far to feed fifty-four men . It is true they had a large number of mules and some horses that could be sacrificed to furnish them with food . They could also count on a limited amount of game , and , when travelingalong the shore , a moderate supply of fish and even an occasional supply of clams , but in their weakenedcondition , due to the scurvy , the men could not have long survived on a strictly meat diet . I lad they located the port of Monterey , naturally they would have waited there for the arrival of the supply ship , San Jose , long overdue , with a load of provisions that was to be forwarded from San Blas , Mexico , direct to that port . At that time no one knew or suspected that the San Jose had been lost at sea with all on board . It was more than probable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to San Diego of his safe arrival at Monterey , and even have ordered some of his men to return to San Diego for additional supplies . Perhaps he would have returned with them , as his instructions were to turn over his command to Lieutenant Fages after reaching Monterey . To have sent for and conveyed a load of supplies from San Diego would have taken not less than three and a half to four months , as the men would have had to contend against the winter rains , swollen streams , almost impassable marshes and many other obstacles that would have caused frequent delays and made it impossible to reach the men of the Portola expedition before April first or fifteenth , too late to save them . There was still another way in which help might have reached them before the impending catastrophe could have overwhelmed them . They could have counted on the return of the San Antonio . It was the ship that had been sent back to the royal warehouse at San Blas , Mexico , for additional supplies , and a request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died of scurvy . Five months had elapsed since her departure and she might return any day with the sadly needed soldiers , sailors and provisions . What happened to that ship is told elsewhere . P143While the Monterey situation , as above set forth has never been considered by our historians , it require ; no great stretch of the imagination to see what would more than likely , have happened to Commander-in Chief Portola and his men if they had succeeded it finding the famous port.  |p144San  Diego 's Serious Condition C ONDITIONS at San Diego had not improved any since Portola 's departure . Additional soldiersand sailors had died of scurvy , and few , if any , had escaped from that dreaded disease . Taking advantage of existing conditions , the savages had grown insolent and daring , and did not hesitate to steal anything they could lay their hands on , even going so far as to rob the hospital beds of their sheets and blankets . While two of the soldiers remaining at San Diego were taking their horses to be watered , they noticed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a most unusual thing . This aroused their suspicion , and as quickly as possible they returned to the mission and reported these facts to Martin Reyes , who immediatelyordered all the capable men under arms , had the invalids and sick removed to safer quarters and then prepared to defend the mission , if attacked . They did not have long to wait . At a signal , thesavages began firing arrows from all sides , but the soldiers , for the first time using their muskets againstthem , were ordered to aim carefully and shoot to kill . This was more than the savages had bargained for , and after three of their number had been killed and  |p145a  dozen or more seriously wounded , they quickly with . drew , carrying off their dead and wounded . Among the mission 's defenders , one soldier , one Christian Indian and Father Vizcaino were slightly wounded , and a young man by the name of Vergerano , servant to Father Serra , was killed . Previous to this unexpected outbreak the soldiers had always fired into the air with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the savages , and they saw how deadly it was , they fled precipitately , and there was no further molestation of the inmates of the mission and the outlying tents and cabins . Martin Reyes , in charge of the mission guard , after consulting with Captain Vila of the San Carlos , Jose Canizares , Dr. Prat and the Franciscan fathers , immediatelyset all the men at work erecting a stockade around the main buildings , and at no ' time were any armed savages allowed to enter the inclosure . In makingthis change , the cabin built for Camila 's use was moved nearer to the mission building . At the suggestion of Dr. Prat , one of the Francis= can fathers would at different times accompany the doctor on his visits to Camila . She was gradually improvingin health , but still required a great deal of care and attention . Marta and Ignacio , like so many others that remained at San Diego , were also stricken with an attack of scurvy , but fortunately both had a mild attack and made a rapid recovery. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the care and comfort of their beloved charge . During the long winter evenings Ignacio would touch his guitar , and together with Marta he crooned the lullabies and love songs that Juan had taught them . The sweet blending of their voices , coming to Camila from the adjoining apartment , would gradually quiet her nerves and she would drop off into a deep and restful sleep . As the days , weeks and months went by , and no word came from Mexico , there was a general feeling of depression , especially among the soldiers and sailors who were still sick or convalescing at San Diego , and the same was true of nearly everyone connected with the expeditions . More than six months had passed since the San Antoniohad sailed for San Blas , Mexico , for additional men and supplies . The men , soldiers , sailors and neophytes , were sorely needed to replace those that had died , and , as no crops had yet been raised in Alta California , the supplies brought up by Captain Rivera and the two sailing ships would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ San Antonio . It was possible , as Captain Vila pointed out , that the San Antoniomight have been ordered to sail direct for the port of Monterey . Even so , some word should have come overland , apprising the San Diego mission of it . The saddest part of all was , that nothing had been accomplished during all those weary months of waiting . On the contrary , the mission records showed that since the departure of Captain Portola for Monterey , there had been nineteen additional deaths , and not a single convert to gladden the hearts of the brave , self-p 147sacrificing Franciscan fathers . That dreaded disease scurvy , and the many deaths it had caused so fright ened the savages that they wanted none of the food o religion of the white faces . It has been well said " that misfortunes never corn singly . " Another , and a far more serious , misfortun was about to overtake the dwindling colony at San Diego in the return to it , on January 24 , 1770 , of th entire Portola expedition , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that delightfully coo summer day , July 14 , 1769 . Slowly and dejectedly Captains Portola and Rivera , Lieutenant Fages , th engineer Miguel Costanso , Sergeant Ortega , Corpora Rocha , Fathers Crespi and Gomez , and a straggling line of soldiers , muleteers and a few neophytes , al looking half-starved and completely worn out , came into the stockade . At intervals , a few shots were fire ( to apprise the mission of their coming , and all wen made welcome , but the greetings were tinged with dis may and dread . " What was the matter ? " " What has happened ? ' " Why have you returned ? " Were a few of the ques t ions that were asked . The sad story was soon told and its telling did not lighten the general depression . Then followed a perioc of wistful waiting . There were some rifts in the over hanging clouds . Father Crespi 's report of the man ) Indian rancherias , and the almost universal kindness shown to the members of the expedition by the native ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ful signs , and greatly pleased Father Serra , as it assured many converts to Christianity . A small outline drawing , made by Crespi , of the coast line where the second cross had been planted convincedboth Serra and Captain Vila of the San Carlos that both in going north and returning south the expeditionhad camped close to and even faced " the famous port of Monterey , " as it had been called by Cabrera Bueno and Sebastian Vizcaino . Another cheerful bit of news , told by Sergeant Ortega , was the finding of a big inland body of water and an arm of the sea which they could not cross without a boat . " Unfortunately , " said Ortega , " we did not have the time to make a more careful investigation , as His Excellencyhad ordered us to prepare to return to Point Pinos . " Among the most harrowing tales told around the camp-fire after the expedition 's return to San Diego was of the slaughtering of the first mule , and serving it as a part of the daily rations to the hungry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or go hungry . Some went hungry . They told of the terrible hardships , made more trying as they advanced farther north , by incessantdays of cold and penetrating rains ; and of snowstormsin the higher altitudes , that made every foot of the weary way through that wild and unknown region seem like a mile . They told of the many men taken sick ( seventeen at one time ) , and how they had to be carried along in lit/ters , and how the soldiers had to feed them like babies , and rub their arms and legs to help circulation . It was a pitiful sight , and , with all this , starvation staring them in the face . " It was hard , " exclaimed one of the soldiers ; " but we did not find fault or complain , as we knew El Comandante ( the soldiers had various titles for Portola : Some spoke of him as El Capitan , others as El Comandanteand others as El Gobernador ) was suffering just as much as the rest of us , and the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say , boys , " spoke up another soldier , " it certainly was a very happy hour when the order came for all to prepare to return to San Diego , even though our rations had been cut down to three pancakes a day . " On their return march , at several of the camp-sites near Santa Barbara , considerable food was supplied to the expedition by some of the natives in exchange for glass beads , colored calicoes and pieces of cheap jewelry , and it was this additional food , with what little the soldiers brought in from their hunting and fishing trips , that kept the men from actual starvation . But on reaching San Diego they all showed the effects of their very limited rations . Naturally , Corporal Rocha was anxious to hear about Camila , and he thought it strange that Ignacio had not looked him up to tell him what had happened since he left San Diego . As soon as his duties permitted , Juan hastened to see Father Serra . He was warmly welcomed . The father had already been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ north by Father Crespi , and he turned to Juan with , " Well , my son , you certainly did not gain much weight while looking for the port of Monterey ? " " Alas ! no , nor did I lose any by indulging my appetitefor mule stew and raw acorns . " " Evidently you believe it is better to lose in weight than in wit , my son ? " " I have n't any too much to spare of either , but knowing my disposition , I drew the line at mule stew . " " Why underestimate yourself ? " " Youth rarely does , and I am still young and hope-ful . " " You will be even more hopeful , my son , after you hear what I have to say . Your Camila is doing very well , in fact even better than Dr. Prat expected . I call to see her quite often , in company with the doctor , and so do Fathers Vizcaino and Parron . " " That is certainly very kind of you , Father . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a very capable nurse and she is devotedly attached to her . Ignacio has also been a great help , poor boy . He is just getting over an attack of pneumonia . " " Ah , that is why I did not see him on my arrival . " " That was why . When he learns that you are here , it will cheer him up , I know . You might call on him and urge his going for walks with you . " " Indeed , I will , Father . " " I know , Corporal , that you are anxious to seep 151Camila , and it is only right that you should , but we must ask Dr. Prat as to the time . You want to remember , when you do see her , not to show any surprise at her appearance . She is still very weak , and you must be careful not to excite her . " Juan cried out , " Father you are not holding anythingback ? Is there any danger ? " " Only such as might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied Serra as Juan got up and turned away to hide his tears . In a voice breaking with sobs , Juan begged the father to forgive him . Deeply moved by the corporal 's emotion , Serra to show his sympathy for Juan , rested a hand upon his shoulder as he said , " Try to control your feelings , my son . " " God knows how hard I try to control them , dear Father , but the memory of my dear one 's suffering has lived with me continuously ever since we left here . In the daytime I prayed for the night to come , so that , on bended knees , I might offer up my prayers for her recovery , and I regretted my sleeping hours , fearing that in them my thoughts might not be of my loved one . So day and night I suffered . The one hope I had was that God , in His Divine goodness , would save her , and earnestly I begged His forgiveness for the wrong I had done my dear Camila in urging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done well , my son , to ask God 's help and forgiveness , and who knows but what your penitentialprayers have been answered , and that bothp152you and Camila will live to enjoy many years of hapness . Keep on praying , and I will add my prayers yours , and ask our Heavenly Father to bless and comfort both you and Camila . I will speak to Dr. rat for you and ask his consent to your seeing Camila. a come and see me again about this time tomorrow id , if the doctor does not object , I will let you know hen we can go to see your betrothed . " Serra and Dr. Prat were visiting with Camila . As ey came into the cabin , Marta greeted them and en retired through a curtained opening into her own apartment . Dr. Prat , after making a cursory examination of s patient , remarked : " I think Camila is doing quite ell , Father , and I believe we will soon be justified letting her sit up again . " " That is good news @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Camila , Serra continued , " Were you frightedby the noise of the shooting ? " " Just for a moment , Father , but I am curious to tow what the shooting was about ? " " You see , even the daughter and sister of a soldier n be curious , Doctor . I presume , in order to satisfy . r curiosity , I had better tell her ; but , my daughter , to are not to get excited or upset over it , or the ) ctor will send me away and give you some of those sty pills he carries about with him . Well , here goes , shall I start with once upon a time ' ? "  | " Doctor , Father Serra is trying to tease me , and I think you had better send him away . " " Senorita , your wishes shall be obeyed . Father , you must leave at once . Your doctor commands you ! " " Worthy sir , I regretfully take my departure . Adios . " As Serra started to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , I did not mean that . You must not let him go , Doctor , until he has told me all the latest news , and I 'll promise not to get excited , and wear my sweetest smile . " " Now that is more like it , eh , Doctor ? Well , the shots you heard , my daughter , were to announce the returnfrom the north of Captain Portola and the members of his expedition , and by this time tomorrow all will be back again in San Diego . " That was quite a shock to Camila , who was trying hard to control herself , and in a tense and halting voice whispered , " Then Juan is here , and I can see him , Father ? " " If the doctor gives his consent . " Both Serra and Camila were looking at the doctor , who finally answered , " Perhaps tomorrow , under certainrestrictions . But first , Camila , you must promise me , if Juan comes to see you , not to get excited or give way to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Serra present at the meeting . " " I am willing to promise you anything , Doctor , but do , do , dear friend , let me see Juan ? " " I want you to see him , Camila , but his first visit will have to be a short one , and remember , you are to control your emotions or Juan will be ordered to leave at once . " " I will try my best , Doctor , and I feel quite confidentthat you will have no cause to find fault with me . " " That is the way I like to hear you talk , and in the meantime I will see Juan and prepare him for his visit to you . No doubt you will also want to see your brother , Jose  --  " " But he will scold me , Doctor , " Camila cried out . " No , no , never again , " Serra assured her . " Your brother realizes that you are no longer a child , but as your guardian he has certain rights , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I admit Jose has such rights , Father , but for the past two years he has been so strict with me , and so hard toward Juan , that I have learned to fear him . " " I know that the sergeant is a strict disciplinarian . Even the doctor has commented on that , but he is also a just man , and I believe he has your best interestsat heart . Furthermore , I am sure that in your present condition he will have the greatest possible sympathy for you . " " Then you do n't think he will scold me ? " " Scold you ! I 'd like to see him try it ! No , no , Camila , you need not fear Jose . On the contrary , " Dr. Prat assured her , " he will take you up in his arms , just as he did , no doubt , when you were a three-yearoldand begged him for some money to buy candy with . "  | " You are right , " Serra added . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " Yes , this patient of yours has been abusing us shamefully . I want you to see that she keeps quiet , and no cry , but make plenty smiles , and maybe sleep . " " I know , Doctor . " " All right . How is Ignacio ? " " All right . Him go walk now , first time . " " Good . Remember your promise , Camila . Ready Father ? " " All ready . Adios. "  |p156Have  They Deserted Us ? NEARLY a year had passed since the last of the four expeditions left Lower California , and in all that time nothing had been heard from Don Joseph de Galvez , the inspector-general , or the Marquisde Croix , the Mexican viceroy , or any of the Franciscanauthorities . The situation puzzled everyone . Galvez knew that additional supplies would be needed , and knowing this , why had he failed to send them ? The Marquis de Croix was also interested in the successful outcome of the San Diego-Monterey occupation . Had they been ordered to abandon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they failed to send word of it to Captain Portola or Father Serra ? Why had the sailing ship San Jose failed to bring the sorely needed supplies ? What had become of the San Antonio , also long overdue ? These and many other weighty questionswere bandied about by the officers and men at San Diego , but no one could satisfactorily answer them . Even the neophytes knew that they were facing a serioussituation and , like all the other members of the San Diego colony , they looked to their commander-in-chief to make the next move . Captain Portola called a meeting of all his officers and the Franciscan fathers . They were to talk things  |p157over  and it was understood that Portola was to tell them of some of his experiences in the north , for the information and edification , if they could so consider it , of those who remained at San Diego . " After we had failed to find the port of Monterey , " Portola told them , " we decided to keep on going north , where Sergeant Ortega and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the east , and an ocean gateway to the north , but this could not be explored for the want of a boat to cross it . The inland sea , Father Crespi believes , was the bay of San Francisco . " With ample provisions we could have carried these explorations on for a longer period , but a rapidly diminishing supply of flour and the lack of meat , vegetablesand dried fruit made that impossible . Then our failure to find the San Jose or San Antonio within the next few days compelled us to turn about and come back . " We were troubled , too , by the large number of our men on the sick list . Few escaped and many had to be carried along in litters from camp to camp . Weather conditions were also growing worse . Our days and nights were cold and damp , and thick heavy fogs that penetrated to the bone shut out the world and made t raveling dangerous . It was not a very agreeable outlook , yet our men did not complain . Rations had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to three , and finally , to add to our supplies , mules had to be sacrificed . " At last , with starvation facing us , we turned south- ward , but kept within sight of the sea wherever possible , still hoping we might find the port of Monterey or sight the San Jose or San flntonio , but it was not to be . " No doubt , much of this you have already heard and will hear again . For those brave men who went with me in search of the port of Monterey , and , thank God , safely returned to San Diego , I feel that a word of praise is due . The trials , hardships and disappointmentsthey underwent so cheerfully will never be forgottenby our officers , and I want to thank each and every member of the expedition , in behalf of our country and our king , for their unflagging devotion and loyalty . " The one hopeful outlook that was left to us was the expectation of our finding at least one of the long overdue ships riding at anchor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at least one of these ships here has been the greatest of our disappointments ; as you all realize , it is also the most serious . Our food supplies are being rapidly consumed , and even though our rations have been reduced to a minimum , they will not last much longer . Now , gentlemen , knowing the seriousness of our situation , I should like to hear from each and every one of you , and what suggestions you have to offer . " Father Serra , the head of the Franciscan fraternity in the Californias , was the first to be called on . " Personally , " said the eminent padre , " I am not at all depressed by the existing conditions , as I feel confidentthat relief , in some form or other , will soonp159reach us and make it possible for us to carry on this work that God has ordained we are to do . In speaking with Father Crespi , and our engineer , Senor Costanso , about what the place looked like where you had planted the second cross , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , that you did find the port of Monterey , and both these gentlemen are now inclined to agree with me . Captain Vila is also of the same opinion , but it will take another visit to prove we are right . " Captain Rivera and Lieutenant Fages made no comment on Father Serra 's statement , but both agreed that some drastic action must soon be taken should no additionalmen and provisions reach them . Sergeant Ortega , recognized by everyone as a most capable officer , agreed with Rivera and Fages , but , in addition , he suggested that as many men as possible be sent out on hunting and fishing trips , not only to increasethe supply of food , but likewise to keep the men busy , and if , at the expiration of another fortnight , no relief came from the south another conference be called . Although Captain Portola was inclined to return to lower California immediately , he thought Sergeant Ortega 's suggestion worthy of consideration , and ordered them to be carried out . Corporal Rocha was again to meet with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a definite time when he would be allowed to see Camila , had , for some reason or other , sent word to Juan by Ignacio , that he delay his visit for a day or two . So it was not until the fifth day after his return to San Diego that Juan was permitted to see his betrothed , who had had a slight relapse , due , undoubtedly , to the noise and unusual excitement caused by the return of the Portola expeditionfrom the north . The change from the prevailing quiet existing at the San Diego mission , where one rarely heard any noise at all , and where even the human voice in ordinary conversationfailed to carry to Camila 's apartment , was quite marked , and both Dr. Prat and Marta noticed its reactionon their patient , and how much it interfered with her rest and sleep . This resulted in Dr. Prat 's ordering the postponement of Camila 's meeting with Juan and her brother , Jose , until she regained some of her strength . While waiting to see Camila , Juan had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he learned how very ill Camila had been . Ignacio , again able to be out , had gone on two fishing trips with Juan , and these outingswere doing both of them a lot of good . While Ignacio was getting the benefit of the fresh air and sunshine , he also had the pleasure of again being with his beloved corporal . At the same time , Juan , with Camila as his sole subject , was plying his friend Ignacio with a hundred and one questions about his sweetheart . Occasionally , they would catch a few fish , but their day 's fishing would not greatly increase the mission 's food supply . Dr. Prat , accompanied by Father Serra , was againp 161visiting Camila . With a smile and cheerful greeting , the doctor seated himself by Camila 's bedside . After feelingher pulse , he turned to Serra and said , " Do you know , Father , I think our Camila has been praying to Our Lady of Loreto , ' at least I should judge so from her looks . " As Camila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , you are not to talk , I want you to reserve your strength and keep on smiling . Let me raise your pillow up a bit and give you a teaspoonful of honey . There . Now , Father Serra , I think it will be all right to have Camila see Corporal Rocha , so I 'll step out and ask him to come in , and then look up the sergeant . Remember , Father , Juan is not to remain over five minutes . " " Did you hear that , my daughter ? " Serra countered . After going out the doctor again cautioned Juan to subdue his feelings , and not to remain with Camila more than a few minutes . As Camila 's room was darkened , Juan at first failed to notice how frail she was . Her appearance was a great shock to him . As he looked down upon the woman he so dearly loved , words failed him , nor could he check his tears as he dropped on his knees at his dear one 's bedside , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who gently urged her dear Juan not to take it so hard . Almost reverently she laid her hand on his head , trying to soothe him as the deep sobs he tried so hard to control completely unnerved him . Father Serra was so deeply moved by this heart- breaking scene that he hastily withdrew , leaving Juan and Camila to compose their feelings . Serra knew that both had passed through countless days of intense suffering , and Juan 's nervous collapse could easily be excused . Poor boy , having been half-starved and underfed for months , and distressed from day to day by the constant thought that his loved one might not live , his was an ordeal that few could have lived through . Still soliloquizing , Serra remembered that Dr. Prat had told him he must not let Juan remain with Camila more than five minutes . Aloud he said , " Fortunately , I forgot to wind up my timepiece last night . I am sure a few minutes more will not harm either one of them . " Gradually , Camila succeeded in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes , and as she stretched out her arms , Juan clasped her to his breast . They were alone once more , with their hearts overflowingwith happiness , and their dear friend Father Serra guarding them from intrusion . Juan knew he had overstayed his time . Dr. Prat knew he would , and Serra 's watch had stopped . Gently Juan laid his Camila down , and as he withdrew his arms he whispered to her , " Only God knows how I longed for this day and hour , dearest . To feel your arms around my neck as your heart beat in unison with mine should make us both feel deeply grateful to our Heavenly Father , and our dear friends Dr. Prat , Fathers Serra and Vizcaino , Marta and Ignacio . Listen , dear ! That is Father Serra coughing . It meansp163that I must go . " Juan called to him : " Come right in , Father . " As Serra entered the room he was surprised to see how happy and contented they both appeared . Turning to Camila , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " I do n't believe that it has , Father . " " Then all is well . Now , Juan , when Dr. Prat knocks on the door , you can slip through Ignacio 's quarters , and the doctor will be none the wiser . " " Thank you , Father , for your great kindness to me and my dear Camila . Good-bye , dearest , until we meet again . " " Your five minutes are up , my son . Hurry ! " As Juan left , Marta came into Camila 's room and overheard her saying to Father Serra , " Did you notice , Father , how thin Juan is ? " " Yes , I did , and no wonder . I heard that for many weeks they did not have enough to eat , and food became so scarce that they had to kill some of the mules to keep from starving . I am inclined to believe that for sentimental reasons Juan did not care to eat any of the mule stew , or else it disagreed with him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied , then , as though communing with herself : " Poor , poor Juan , how he must have suffered ! " Dr. Prat 's entrance broke up this train of thought , and walking up to Camila 's bedside he said , " I see our charming patient has kept her promise , so , do n't you think , Father Serra , that she is entitled to an extra cup of chocolate for good behavior ? " " You remember , Doctor , that I told you I was sure Camila would obey your instructions , and I agree with you that she is entitled to the chocolate . " " How about it , Marta , is there still some chocolate left ? " " Oh , yes , Doctor , you say me not much use one time , so I mix with panoche ( Mexican sugar ) up , and she makes yet some drinks for dear friend what likes much sweetness . I go now for make hot water and bring cholclet quick . " Dr. Prat , stepping to the outer door : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like Juan , Sergeant Jose de Ortega had been duly cautioned to he careful and limit his stay . Jose came in very slowly , and , walking up to Camila 's bedside , said , " My dear , dear little sister . " Jose , stooping over , kissed Camila and rested his hand lightly on hers . Wistfully looking up at Jose , who was having a hard time of it trying to check his tears , Camila , in a voice vibrant with deep affection and arms outstretched , cried out as her brother lifted her up and held her in his arms , " My dear , dear brother . " Dr. Prat and Father Serra had quietly left the cabin as Jose entered it . In the adjoining apartment Marta and Ignacio were crooning a lullaby.  |p165The  Indian Chief Topanque SOME days prior to the return of Captain Portola a party of Indians had set up a few brushwood wigwams on the bay shore not far from where the San Carlos was anchored . They spent most of their time fishing , and many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Indians differed somewhat from those inhabiting the San Diego bay region . The men were mostly well built and appeared quite superior to the other natives , with whom they rarely mingled . There were fifteen men in the party , and with them was one middle-aged and one young woman and two boys , one about eleven and the other about twelve years old . It was learned that they were members of a large Indian rancheria ( village ) living in the back country , and , like many others , were lured to the coast by their liking for salt-water food . Corporal Rocha and two other leather-jacket soldiers , Martin Reyes and Manuel Machado , had been detailed to act as guards for two days on the San Carlos . While Juan was looking over the bay , he saw two Indian boys paddling about on a raft built of tules . Apparently they intended to row out to the San Carlos , when suddenly one of the boys was seen to fall and slip partly over the edge of the raft and , in so doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were thrown into the bay . Their loud cries for help soon attracted attention . Both Juan and Martin Reyes , quickly pulling off their heavy boots and leather jackets , jumped overboard , and as both were powerful swimmers they soon reached the drowning boys and swam to shore with them . The boys belonged to the small band of savages that had located a camp near the bay shore . They were the sons of Topanque , chief of the tribe . The older boy afterward became known as Fernando and the younger one as Juanito . Their cries for help had been heard by all the members of Topanque 's party , but they were too far away to reach them in time to save them . Every move of the swimmers was anxiously watched from the shore by the Indians , and several of them swam out to lend a helping hand if needed , and willing hands were outstretched to welcome the rescued and rescuers . In every way known to Topanque 's Indians they tried to show their gratitude and appreciation to Juan and Martin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A word or two from Topanque and his braves quietly surrounded these strange white faces as the chief presentedeach one of them with a bow , some arrows and a finely tanned deerskin . Although Juan and Martin could not converse with the Indians , they soon learned the names of all the members of Topanque 's people . They were also introduced to the chief 's daughter , Natooka , and his sister , Cojuati . In sign language , Topanque also tried to tellp167Juan and Martin that every member of his band was ready to lay down his life for them or the members of the mission party . While this pantomime was going on , the third soldier , Manuel Machado , had rowed in from the San Carlos and was ready to carry his companions back to the ship . Machado was a gray-haired Catalonian volunteer who had spent many years of his life in the service of his country . He was exceedingly bashful , a habit he had never outgrown , and even though some of the younger men made fun of him , they all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cojuati , the widowedsister of Topanque , who was fair , fat and slightly past forty , had noticed his arrival , and going up to Juan , she motioned to him and called his attention to Machado . Juan , quickly grasping what Cojuati wanted , called to Machado and asked him to join them . He came reluctantly , but Juan , being his superior officer , told him to step lively , and he was soon introduced to the others . Cojuati was greatly attracted to this doughty son of Mars . Martin on the other hand , found Natooka unusually attractive and he decided to become better acquainted with her . After some further interchangeof good feeling , Juan , Martin and Machado , with a military salute , bade them all good-bye , and returned to their ship . After completing their two days of guard duty on board the San Carlos , Juan , Reyes and Machado were paying another visit at Topanque 's camp . There theyp168were soon joined by the Indian neophyte , Ignacio , who came to report Camila 's condition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be able to understand Topanque 's dialect and act as an interpreterfor them . After greeting their newly made friends , they introduced Ignacio to Topanque . Ignacio tried to speak to the chief in his own tongue , and Topanquemade a like attempt in several of the tribal tongues that he understood , but the two attempts were not at all successful . However , there were a few words that both seemed to understand and with their sign language and pantomine they got along fairly well . There were a great many things they all wanted to talk about , but not being able to understand one anothermade it rather difficult . Finally , Ignacio made out that Topanque wanted to leave the older of his two boys at the mission , under the care of Martin Reyes , who had saved him from drowning . Ignacio explained to Juan that it was Topanque 's idea to have his son learn to speak the language of the white faces , and in turn Juan , Reyes and some of the others , if they so desired , could learn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Juan , and , as spokesman for their party , he asked Ignacio to explain to Topanqueas well as he could that he thought well of the plan , but it would have to he submitted to Father Serra , and he might also want Captain Portola to pass on it , and if they were satisfied , word would be sent to Topanqueabout it . Before leaving Topanque 's camp , Juan and his corn/panions showed the Indians a better way to preserve their fish . In order to facilitate this work , Juan presentedTopanque with his pocket knife . Having virtuallyno tools for disemboweling their fish , or not caring to take the trouble to do so , the Indians would merely hang them up in the air to dry and eat them in any old way , without further ado . With his knife , Juan showed Topanque how to quickly remove the scales , then properlyclean the fish for drying or smoking . In this way , he explained to the chief , fish can be kept for an indefiniteperiod without danger of putrefaction and would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accustomed to eat fish , and in fact nearly all other kinds of food , prepared or unprepared , withoutregard to hygienic laws . While all this was going on , Natooka , Cojuati and many other members of the camping parties had been interested spectators . Reyes and Machado , however , were more interested in Natooka and Cojuati . To have an attractive looking woman smile upon him , and by her actions show that she was really interested in him , was a new and very delightful experience for the grayhairedsoldier Machado , and while it pleased him in a way , he did n't know just what to make of it . With Martin Reyes it was just the other way about . While Natooka was very happy , indeed , to have such a finelookingman treat her with such courtesy and consideration , she failed to sense its significance . She was still too young to realize what it might lead to . In that , Cojuati had the advantage of her more attractive niece.  |p170Portola  's Action CausesConsternationAFTER waiting nearly three weeks at San Diego @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jose or the San Antonio enter the harbor , Captain Portola had another conference with Rivera , Fages and Ortega at the company headquarters . WithCorporal Rocha 's completed inventory before them , showing the total amount of food left on hand at themission , they all agreed that something would have tobe done at once . Various suggestions were made anddiscussed , and finally Captain Portola decided to sendCaptain Rivera , with necessary soldiers and pack animals , back to Velicata to bring up the cattle , etc. , leftat that mission , and such other supplies as could beobtained from the other missions in Lower California . Turning to Ortega , Portola said , " Sergeant , you willsee to it that twenty soldiers are properly outfitted toaccompany Captain Rivera . Use all the available helpso as to get the expedition started as soon as possible . " As Portola was leaving with Rivera and Fages , hecalled out to Ortega , " Sergeant , Father Vizcaino maywant to go south with Captain Rivera . If so , I wish youwould see that he is furnished with an easy-ridinghorse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during the skirmish the mission soldiers had with the San Diego savages , on August 15th , and the wound had not yet healed . ) Ortega saluted . " I will see to it , Your Excellency . " He then ordered one of the soldiers to find Corporal Rocha and tell him to report at company headquarters at once . After returning to the mission , Juan , Reyes and Machado called on Father Serra and told him of their meeting with the Indian chief , Topanque , and the members of his tribe . This deeply interested Serra , and he plied the three soldiers with questions about the savages . Turning to Juan , he said , " Tell me , my son , what is your personal opinion of the boy and his people ? " " To me , Father , Fernando , for that is the name we have given him , seems to be unusually bright and he should prove an apt pupil . I was very favorably impressed with Topanque , the chief or headman of his tribe , and most of his followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far superior to the natives in this vicinity , both mentally and physically . They have some traits that I know you will find objectionable , but , I believe , once they are pointed out to them , they will be changed . " Turning to Reyes and Machado , Serra asked , " Are you both of the same opinion ? " " We are , indeed , Father , " both answered . " Did you- learn , Juan , how much longer they will remain here ? "  | " Ignacio told me that they intend to leave within the next few days . " " Then we must lose no time in letting them know about the boy . I am sure that Captain Portola will approve of our having the boy stay here , even though it will mean another mouth to feed , but I am willing to share part of my food with him , and I know the other fathers will gladly give up a portion of their food allowance to help supply the boy 's needs . " Turning to Reyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , go with Father Parron and Ignacio to Topanque 's camp and invite the chief and the members of his band to come and see us ? I should like to have some kind of a talk with your Indian friends and I am sure that GovernorPortola would also like to meet them . You may also inform Chief Topanque that we will be pleased to have his son  --  I believe you christened him Fernando  --  come and live at the mission with us , and I will see to it that he is properly looked after when you are busy elsewhere . " " I 'll be ready to go with Father Parron and Ignacio at any time , and I am sure , Father Serra , that Topanque'speople will enjoy meeting you , and that you will find them interesting . " " Thank you , my son . " Serra again addressing Juan : " Did you hear , Corporal , that one of Sergeant Ortega'smen has been looking for you ? He called here some time ago and said the sergeant wanted to see you at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have heard of it , Father . Thankp173you for the information . I wonder what 's in the wind ? " " I can answer that for you , Corporal , " said Martin Reyes . " I 'll bet my last month 's pay that El Comandantewants to send you to Madrid as a courier to His Majesty , King Carlos . " " No such luck , Martin . It behooves me to report to the sergeant . Good luck to you , Martin . " " Oh , by the way , Machado , I think you had better go along with Reyes , you may meet Cojuati again , " was Juan 's parting shot as he hurried away . Machado tried to answer Juan , but he was so greatly flustered that words refused to come , and he turned aside to hide his confusion . Martin Reyes , sympathizing with his bashful friend , came to his rescue , and patting Machado on the shouldersaid , " You must not mind what Juan says , Manuel . I think he is jealous of you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I am sure of it , Manuel . " It did not take Juan long to reach Portola 's headquarters . On entering , Juan saluted Ortega and said , " I just learned , Sergeant , that you wanted to see me . " " Yes , I do . I ordered one of my men to look for you and ask you to report to me . " " I am sorry if I have kept you waiting , Sergeant . " " No harm has been done , Corporal . Commander Tortola has ordered Captain Rivera with an escort of twenty soldiers , some muleteers and a few Indians to return to Velicata and bring up what cattle and supplies were left there last year and such other provisions as he may obtain from the other missions . I want you , Corporal , to select twenty men , have them properly outfitted , and arrange to go along with them under Captain Rivera 's command . Before doing this , you had better report to Captain Rivera and ask him to furnish you with necessary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it will take to reach Velicata , so that necessaryrations may be supplied for the men . " As Juan was about to leave , Ortega stopped him : " Just a moment , Corporal . I do not want you to think that I have selected you for this detail because of any feelings I have against you . Quite the contrary . It is because I know that you are the best man for the job . " Juan , with considerable doubt in his mind as to Ortega'sunnecessary compliment , yet sore that under presentconditions he was selected to accompany Captain Rivera , replied , " Sergeant , I am a soldier in the king 's service , sworn to obey the orders of my superior offi-cers . " Too late Ortega awakened to the fact that Rocha was an exceptional man , and he wondered if his sister , Camila , was not right in her appraisal of Juan 's character and ability , and that he was wrong . ' Well , time would tell , and the sergeant 's only comment on the corporal 's reply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal . " While Ortega had not shown any open hostility towardJuan , he certainly was not prepossessed in his favor , and he meant to prevent his sister , Camila , fromp175marrying him , if he possibly could . That Ortega purposelyselected Juan to go with Captain Rivera on the expedition to Lower California could not be denied . It was the opening wedge of a scheme he had in mind for weaning Camila away from Juan , and during the corporal'senforced absence bring about a marriage , or at least an engagement , between Camila and Lieutenant Fages . From some remarks made by Lieutenant Fages before he left Lower California in charge of the soldiers that came north on the San Carlos , Ortega knew that Fages was deeply interested in Camila , and , given the opportunity , he believed the lieutenant would soon declare his intentions . There was still another reason for Ortega 's anxiety to bring about this marriage . While at work in Portola'sheadquarters , shortly after the return of the expedition from the north , he could not avoid overhearingCaptain Portola telling Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to turn over his command to Lieutenant Fages , as soon as they reached Monterey and that he was then to return to Mexico . Ortega realized that this was a state secret and he doubted if even Fages knew of the great honor t hat was to be conferred upon him. however , it was still a question of their finding Monterey . If this could be done , it would make LieutenantFages commander-in-chief of all the Alta Californiaforces and virtually a dictator . What a fine thing it would be to have his sister married to a man of such prominence , instead of an unknown soldier ! Who knows to what height a man of Fages ' ability might not attain ? To have Lieutenant Fages , in charge of all of Spain 's activities in Alta California , as a brother-in-law might also serve to advance his own interests , but that , to Sergeant Ortega , was a secondary consideration . The next thing to do was to have anothertalk with Camila . As Sergeant Ortega had not seen his sister for several days , he entered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ health . ' When he learned that she was very much better he asked Marta to find out if he could see Camila . As there was no longer any reason why Ortega could not see her , he was promptly admitted . The constraint between brother and sister had not entirely worn off , but Camila , being anxious to placate her brother , tried her best to please him . Although still confined to her bed , Camila was able to move about more freely , showing that she was steadily improving . In fact , Dr. Prat had consented to let her sit up within the next few days , providing there were no further complications . " Come in , my dear Jose , " Camila called out to her brother . " I am glad that you have come to see me again . Have you had any word from Loreto ? " " No , we have not had any word from Loreto since we left there nearly a year ago , " Jose answered , as he stooped over and kissed her , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Our present situation is causing much uneasiness , and , with the limited rations being doled out , it is causing general dissatisfaction . " " What does Captain Portola think is the cause for this long silence and delay ? " " Neither Captain Portola , Father Serra , nor CaptainVila can offer any satisfactory explanation . It is mysterious to say the least . Lieutenant Fages has offered two solutions , but neither one may be right , although they are reasonable enough . He believes that either one or both our ships have been lost at sea , or that an earthquake may have wiped out the west coast of Mexico . " " You think a great deal of Lieutenant Fages , do n't you , Jose ? " " Yes , I do , Camila . He has a bright , active mind , is a capable soldier , and I am sure if he lives he will some day become one of Mexico 's ablest officers . It may please you to know , Camila , that he inquires about you almost every day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are able to sit up I would bring him in to see you . " " That was very nice of you , Jose . " " He is the kind of a man that I 'd like to have you marry . " " You forget , Jose , that I am engaged to another . " " You could give up Juan . " " Why should I ? We love each other sincerely and I know he is worthy of any woman 's love . " " Do n't you think you could do much better ? " " In what way ? You must admit , Jose , that his familyp178is as good as ours and some day he will be a rich man , but even if he were poor , I would marry him just the same . I know that Juan is a gentleman and a brave soldier , two qualities that have endeared him to his superior officers and his fellow soldiers , who , I have been told , greatly admire him . Do n't you think , brother , that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ qualities ? " " I have nothing against Rocha as a soldier and I am willing to admit that he is above the average , but to have him as a brother-in-law is another question . I had always hoped to see you married to a man of reputation and prominence , and I can not deny that your elopement with him was a sad blow to me . " " It was wrong , I know , Jose , and we both regret it , but Juan believed it was the only thing left for us to do . " " At least promise me , Camila , that you will not marry anyone without my consent , and not until you are fully restored to health and are assured of a comfortablehome . " " I do not want to make any rash promises , Jose , but you are my brother , as well as my legal guardian , and it is only right that you should be consulted in the matterof my marriage . I am willing to make this promise : until I reach my twenty-first birthday @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not then , if I am not in good health ; but in return , Jose , I want you to promise me that you will treat Juan with the consid/eration due from one gentleman to another , regardless of your position as his superior officer . " " We both have our duties to perform , Camila , andI know Corporal Rocha will ask no favors of me . " " He is too proud for that , I know , but I do not wantyour resentment to turn to hatred , Jose . " " If it did , I 'd still try to be just to him . " The entrance of Dr. Prat and Father Serra interruptedthe conversation between Camila and Ortega , and while Dr. Prat visited with his patient , Father Serra took advantage of the opportunity to inquire of Ortega , " When do you think Captain Rivera will leave for Velicata ? " " Possibly the day after tomorrow . If you have any letters you want forwarded , have them ready by that time . If you will pardon me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things to look after , and must be going . " Ortega walked over to Camila , kissed her , and , salutingFather Serra and Dr. Prat , he left the room . " Well , Father , it begins to look as though I 'll soon he out of a job . " " Is it as bad as that , Doctor ? " " Alas ! yes , my dear friend . Even now our dear Camila is planning to banish me from her presence , and henceforth her welcoming smiles will be reserved for a younger and handsomer man . " " How can you be so unkind , Doctor ? Do you think it will ever be possible for me to forget your kindness and sympathy for me during the many months while I was lying at death 's door , and how you and Fathers Serra and Vizcaino and our dear Marta watched over and prayed for me as I lay partly or wholly unconscious , often unseeing and unknowing , through those days of racking pain . " I know , of course , dear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , and merely intended it as a bit of banter , but to me the memory of your kindness and that of Father Serra and so many others who did so much to comfort me will never be forgotten , and in my prayers I always ask God to bless and reward you for what you have done for me . " " It was our bounden duty , Camila , but we , and I am now speaking not only for myself but for Fathers Serra , Vizcaino , Marta and Ignacio , all know you fully appreciate what we have done for you , and , in return , I feel that we owe you our sincere thanks for your having , unknowingly , been a source of inspiration to all of us . " " Indeed , she has , " said Father Serra , interrupting Dr. Prat , " and we do not want you , my daughter , to feel that you owe us anything ; but , on the contrary , we feel that we are indebted to you for the many lessons you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and steadfast faith in God , and as the years go on I trust and pray that His blessing will abide with you and yours . " The " Amen " of Dr. Prat adequately expressed his feelings . " To change the subject , " said Father Serra , " didp 181your brother tell you that Captain Rivera has been ordered to start for Velicata at once ? " " No , he did not mention it . " " I also heard , " said Dr. Prat , " that Jose had ordered Juan and twenty soldiers to go with him . " " We must not let Juan go ! Father , you must see Captain Portola at once and have him countermand Jose 's order . " " Juan would not want me to do that , Camila . He may only be gone for a few weeks at the most , as I understand they are only going to Velicata . Our food supply is decreasing rapidly and the governor believes that if the cattle that were left at mission Velicata and such additional supplies as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may serve to tide us over until the San Jose or San flntonio arrives , and thus make it possible to successfully carry on our work here , in which I know , my daughter , you are just as deeply interested as we are . " " You are right , Father , but why can not my brother go with Captain Rivera instead of Juan ? " " Portola may have greater need for your brother here . He also knows that Juan is a capable officer , and that in any emergency he will be able to give a good account of himself . " " That is true , Father , and I suppose I must be resignedto whatever may come . " " Bravely said , Camila . . . Ah ! here comes Juan . " As Juan enters , Dr. Prat , asking to be excused , said , " I must go , dear friends , I 'll see you later . Adios. "  | " Am I intruding ? " " Quite to the contrary , Juan . Your coming is quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Camila . " " Then she has heard that I have been ordered to go to Velicata with Captain Rivera ? " " Dr. Prat thought it was best that I should tell Camila , and we are proud of her . If Camila will excuse us for a few minutes I 'll tell you something , Juan , that I think you ought to know . " " You are excused . " " Thank you . " Speaking in a low voice , Father Serra continued , " I may be able to enlighten you , Juan , regardingthe possibility of the Lower California missionssupplying us with such provisions as they can spare . Governor Portola has asked me to write to Father Palou about this , with a request that he take this matter up with the various missions that he thinks can help us , and I know , Father Palou will see to it that this is promptly done . However , this will cause considerabledelay , and I am afraid , unless the San Jose or San Antonio soon puts in an appearance , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego , as it would be useless , because , long before you will be ready to start northward from Velicata , Governor Portola and his expedition will be well on their way toward Loreto . " " Why , of course . I might have figured that out myself , Father . I made up an inventory of our food suppliesand know exactly how much food we have on hand . I also know that it took Captain Rivera fifty-twop183days to march from Velicata to San Diego . In my talk with him a while ago about our journey back to Velicata , he ordered me to prepare rations for twenty-five men for twenty-one days . It will probably take us from fifteen to eighteen days to reach Velicata . It will take from twenty-five to fifty days , at least , to send word to all the missions and gather up the supplies they can spare us , and it will take at least forty-five days to bring up the cattle and supplies from Velicata to San Diego . Conservatively estimated , it would take us one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diego about June fifteenth , if not needlessly delayed . I am beginning to realize how serious the situation is . " " Serious , yes , but far from hopeless , Juan . I am so confident that help will come , that , regardless of what action Captain Portola may take , I mean to stay here and live like the natives , if I have to . " " Then it is really true , Juan , that you must go ? " Camila cried out . " Yes , I am sorry to say it is , " Juan replied , as he walked over to Camila 's bedside . After asking Father Serra to excuse them for a few minutes , Juan and Camila had a whispered conversation . Coming to some decision , Juan turned about and said , " Father , we have a favor to ask of you . " " That you want me to marry you ? " " Yes , we do , Father , but not just yet . Instead , Camilaand I want to know if you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remain true to our betrothal , no matter what may happen to us here or hereafter . "  |p184To  this Camila added , " We want to feel that althoughwe are not able to marry at present , that we belong to each other . " " Have you any fear that someone desires to have you break your engagement , or is there something else that you do not care to disclose that might cause you to break your betrothal vows ? " Camila looked to Juan to answer Father Serra 's questions , and , after hesitating for a moment , Juan cautiously explained , " No , not exactly . You see , Camila made certain promises to her brother , and , unless she gains his consent , he being her legal guardian , our marriagemay be delayed for some years . I believe , eventually , the sergeant will approve our marriage , but in the meantime it would make us both happier , Father , if we knew that , living or dead , no one could come between us and our love ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years to come , such an obligation would make our temporary separation more endurable . So , until we are married , Camila would know that somewhere I am waiting for the coming of that happy hour when I may honestly and honorably lead her to the altar , and I would likewise know , although thousands of miles might separate us , that somewhere my dear Camila is waiting for me . " Father Serra , after first carefully thinking the matterover , said , " This is a rather unusual request , yet I see no reason why I can not grant the favor you ask . Come , join your hands , my children , and carefully weigh my words : Do you , Juan Estevan Rocha , andp185you , Camila Maria de Ortega , promise by your faith in God and the hope of a hereafter , to remain faithful and true to ydur pledged word to join each other in thends of holy wedlock , when it shall please Divine Providence to make that possible ? " Both answered , " We do , and we hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremony . " " Nothing , my dear children , could afford me greater pleasure . Until then , may God keep you in His holy love and grace . "  |p186To|panque  Visits Serra THE cordial invitation of Father Parron 's that Topanque and the members of his band should visit Father Serra and the San Diego mission before they returned to their home in the back country was greatly appreciated by the Indian friends of Juan , Reyes and Machado . Topanque , with words , and aided by gestures , told Ignacio of his plans , and Ignacio in turn informed Father Parron : " Chief he say , maybe two-three days he have so many fish can use . Then he say all come see Fader Serra . I say him , you make dance and sing ? He say , not got plenty men for dance , but he make sing , like Indians , if Fader Serra , he like . " " You may tell him , Ignacio , " said Father Parron , " that we would like to hear them sing , and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son , Fernando , with us , so that he may learn to speak Spanish and to sing our songs . " " I have make two talk , Fader , with chief , and he say , all happy that Fernando , he stay like bruder for Senor Reyes , and he learn speak like white faces . I say him , maybe Fader Serra he let all Indians see holy pictures . He say , we much like see everything . " In this friendly meeting with the Indians Fatherp 187Parron alsoaw the possibility of converting Topanqueand his people to Christianity , and he inquired of Martin Reyes if this subject had been spoken of to any of Topanque 's Indians . " Yes , Father , it has , with the help of Ignacio , but I do not believe that Topanque fully understood what Ignacio tried to tell him . I feel confident , however , that when his son , Fernando , has learned to speak Spanish and becomes a convert to our faith , his own people will soon embrace a like opportunity . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parron , visited with Topanque , the fathers of the mission were surprised to learn that this much talked of Indian chief and his followers , accompanied by Reyes , Machado and Ignacio acting as their escort , were waiting outside of Father Serra 's cabin . As soon as the fathers learned of this they hurried out to meet them . After the Indians'were introduced to the fathers , there was an interchange of questions and some were funny enough to cause considerable merriment . The gathering of so large a body of Indians from the back country aroused unusual interest and soon brought nearly every member of San Diego 's seven-months-old colony to join the crowd . Even Captain Portola and his staff officers were anxious to know what was going on , and as soon as they appeared upon the scene they were introduced to Father Serra 's guests . As Reyes had learned a number of words in the tongue spoken by Topanque , he was able to do somep188of the honors on this occasion and personally presented Natooka and Cojuati to Captain Portola , Lieutenant Fages @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff , Captain Vila and the Franciscan fathers . The unique visit of Topanque and his Indians was greatly appreciated , and before their departure they were presented with strings of glass beads , pieces of gaily colored calicoes and other knickknacks by the mission fathers . Not to be outdone by their hosts , Topanque , in behalf of his tribe presented the fathers with some fine deer skins and also gave them a day 's supply of fresh fish . Fernando , the son of Topanque , who was to remain at the mission under the care of Martin Reyes and the mission fathers , also came into the limelight , and was cordially welcomed to his future home by Father Serra . At Ignacio 's suggestion , the Indians were also shown the room in which church services were held , and Topanque and his followers saw the holy pictures that decorated the interior . This was followed by the Indians singing some of their native songs , which greatly pleased the crowd . As the Indians had a long journey ahead of them , they did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ packs , they passed out of the stockade on their slow but steady march towards the distant foothills . Captain Rivera , with Corporal Rocha and nineteenp189soldiers , Father Vizcaino , two muleteers and two Indianneophytes , left San Diego , February 11 , 1770 , with a string of eighty pack-mules and ten horses . There was nothing to delay their march to Velicata , and as they carried merely enough supplies to see them through to their destination they made rapid headway and reached that newly established mission on February twenty-fifth , making the three hundred and some odd mile journey in fifteen days . They had several insignificant skirmishes with some small bands of savages while nearing Velicata and reported havingkilled two of the Indians and wounding several others . The letters , giving a full account of Captain Portola 's troubles , that they carried for Don Jose de Galvez , the Marquis de Croix , Fathers Palou , Lasuen and some of the other missionaries were promptly forwarded to San Borja and Loreto , via the Lower California mission route.  |p190AT  the San Diego mission a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ busy hewingand sawing some heavy timber that was to be used in the construction of the new presidio building . Captain Portola , seeing these men at work , orderedthem to quit , as he thought it was a waste of time and they might be better employed at something else . When Father Serra heard of this , he began to realize that Portola had made up his mind to leave San Diego for Loreto , as he ( Portola ) was more than ever convinced , as the dreary and tiresome days went by , that the long expected supplies would not reach San Diego in time . Soon after halting all construction work at the San Diego mission , Captain Portola called for another conference , at which all the officers and the Franciscan fathers were asked to be present . After further discussionof the serious outlook now confronting them , Portola finally decided to act , and he told all those present at the meeting that if relief did not reach them by the twentieth of March everyone was to be ready on the morning of that day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Portola 's decision and repeatedly tried to have him reconsider the questionupon which so much depended . He pointed out to Portola that the abandonment of Alta California at so critical a time might mean the loss of the entire province to Spain and the collapse of Galvez 's plans for the establishment of the various new missions for the conversion of the natives to Christianity . He also called Portola 's attention to the fact that within the next ten days there would be quite a large supply of fresh vegetables and that these would be gradually augmented by others , as a great amount of seed had been planted and everything was growing nicely . With a continuous supply of fresh vegetables and with the fresh fish , wild game and temporarily reduced rations , the present food supply could be made to last many weeks longer , and God would surely come to their assistance . Portola , however , being more practical , and with the responsibility of his post as commander-in-chief of the expeditions to be considered , was not to be moved , and even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he refused to make any change in his plans and promptly ordered Sergeant Ortega to see to it that all preparations were made , so that they could leave San Diego on the day set for their departure . That night a secret conference was held in Serra 's cabin . There were present Fathers Serra , Crespi , Par/ron and Gomez , Captain Vila of the San Carlos and Miguel Costanso , the engineer . Avoiding all preliminaries , Serra told them , in as few words as possible , the object of the meeting . " If Captain Portola persists in leaving for Loreto , " said Father Serra , " I shall remain here with Father Crespi or alone , if necessary , and hold out to the end . I am more confident than ever that God has not forsakenus , nor do I intend to forsake Him . I tried to persuade the governor to reconsider his action , but he refused . Possibly , each one of you , if you were in his position , would have done likewise , therefore , we must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the expeditions to Loreto on March twentieth . He is responsible to His Majesty King Carlos , and he would undoubtedly be censured were he to act otherwise under the circumstances . But we followers of our seraphic father St. Francis are responsible only to His Divine Majesty , and He will not censure us if we do not turn back on account of any shortage of food . " Captain Vila and Senor Costanso at once assured Father Serra that they would remain with him . " We can also count on Sergeant Ortega , Martin Reyes , Manuel Machado and several other soldiers , as well as Ignacio and a few other neophytes remaining , if Captain Portola does not object , " said Father Crespi . Father Serra was greatly pleased to learn that so many of his friends were willing to remain and take chances with him for better or for worse. p 193 " In the meantime , " Father Serra kept on , as though uninterrupted , " let us continue to offer up our prayers to God and on bended knees ask Him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to order some of his men to keep fires burning throughout the night from now on , near the entrance to the harbor , so that if the San Jose or the San Antonio should come along after dark , our fires might light them on their way to us . I can not tell you , my dear friends , how deeply I appreciate your sincere loyalty to this blessed cause . Although I am unable to reason it out , I feel confident that help will come before many days have passed , and I want you all to feel as I do about this . Do not become disheartened or discouraged . There is no reason why we should be , now that we have decided on what we are going to do . God bless you all and hold you in His keeping . Good night . " At San Diego bonfires were kept burning at night , near the entrance to the harbor . Every dawn brought renewed hope to that faithful band of peaceful **26;383;TOOLONG , as they watched and waited for the ships that failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disappointed , they were not discouraged . The winter rains , the green grass-covered hills and the beautiful wild flowers were all harbingers of a fruitful year and brought cheer and comfort to the lovers of nature , while the maturing crops of fresh vegetables aided in curing the last of the scurvy vic/tims and helped to increase their daily rations . But the fateful day was drawing nearer and nearer and still no signs of relief . The soldiers and Indians were kept busy . Some were sent out daily on hunting and fishing trips , while others cut up and prepared to dry or smoke the fish and wild game that the men brought into camp . Night after night , while the other inmates of the mission were sleeping , Father Serra , forgetful of the hour , was silently praying to God , and , as he knelt at his prie-dieu , the dim night light showed his fervid countenance inspired with holy thoughts . In the midst of all these troubles that were trying men 's souls at San Diego , Camila was not forgotten . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long time , she accepted the situation cheerfully . This was largely due to the obligation assumed by the lovers to eventually assure their marriage , which proved a living and sustaining joy , both to Camila and Juan , as day and night , though widely separated , they constantly thought of each other , both satisfied to leave their future in God 's hands . Their obligation also served to broaden their views of life . Both began to take a deeper interest in the lives of those with whom they came into daily contact , and it helped them to cheer and comfort others less fortunate than they . As Camila became stronger , it was a pleasure to see her teaching Marta the rudiments of simple living . With such a limited variety of foods , naturally , therep195were restrictions , yet she accomplished wonders . Marta was shown at least a dozen ways of preparing tempting dishes with pinole ( cereal meal ) . The different ways of cooking and serving the various kinds of meat and fish were shown her . She also taught Marta how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ children and how to care for them properly . Then , to Marta 's great enjoyment , she taught her how to read and write , thus opening up an unknown world to one of God 's own children who had heretoforebeen living in total ignorance of life and its manifoldbeauties and obligations . All this , however , was done merely as a return to Marta for the loving care she had taken of Camila during her serious illness , but in doing it she not only made Marta happy but was herself made happier by serving . One day , while Camila was painstakingly showing Marta how to write some simple Spanish words , her brother came in with Lieutenant Fages for a short visit . Marta at once excused herself and retired . Both Jose and the lieutenant were surprised to see Camila take such pains to teach an ordinary Indian woman how to write , and Jose did not hesitate to remark : " I think you are wasting your time , Camila . " " Then you can say the same of Father Serra . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for doing it . " " Fie on you , Brother . How can you speak so disparaginglyof dear Father Serra . Furthermore , you know very well that no Franciscan is ever allowed to receive or accept any money , and about all that any of them get is the simplest kind of food and barely enough clothing to cover the body . " " You are right , Camila , and I 'll retract my state-ment . " " Oh , I know , Jose , that you did not mean to cast any reflections on Father Serra , whom I know you love and respect , and I know that he has the highest regard for you . " " That is the kind of a sister any brother can be proud of , Lieutenant . " " You are right , Sergeant , and I admire your sister because she not only stands up for you , when she knows you are right , but does not hesitate to find fault with you when she knows you are wrong . " " That is very kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and no one should be ashamed to acknowledge them . " " I quite agree with you , Senorita Ortega , and I think anyone who is conceited enough to believe himselfor herself mistake proof , should be socially os-tracised . " " It was my guardian brother , Jose , who first taught me never to be ashamed to admit a mistake , and I have always found that he practices every precept he has ever taught me . " " I am afraid , Camila , that Lieutenant Fages will demand that I be court-martialed for acting under false pretenses . After your able defense of me , he willp 197claim that I am not a soldier but a professor of moral philosophy and demand my dishonorable discharge from the king 's service . " " Do you know , sergeant , without flattery to you , I have often thought you were fitted for something better than a soldier . " " Talking about soldiers , " said Camila , in order to change the subject , " can either of you tell me when we are going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lieutenant Fages can answer that question for you , Camila . " " As far as I know , the commander has definitely set March twentieth as the day for our departure and he is not likely to change it , unless our long expected supplies should arrive . " " I do n't know how you gentlemen feel about it , but I know that I shall feel very sorry for Father Serra if we have to return . I know he will never turn back , and if I were a man , I 'd stay here with him and starve to death , if I had to , and feel that I had died for a worthy cause . However , I feel just as confident as Father Serra does about it that relief will come , in some form or other , before it is too late , and Spain 's peaceful conquest of California can then be carried out . " " I sincerely hope that both you and Father Serra are right . Well , Jose , I think we had better go back to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say adios . " " I am with you , Lieutenant . Adios , Camila. "  |p198With  Portola 's consent Father Serra ordered a novena , or nine days of public prayer . This was done in honor of St. Joseph , San Diego 's patron saint . As the time set for Portola 's departure was drawingnear , Serra asked for a single day 's postponement . As twenty-four hours would make but little difference one way or another , Captain Portola , to please Father Serra , granted his request . Undaunted and undismayed , and as hopeful as ever that God would not forsake them , the morning of March 19 , 1770 , found the devout Father Serra arrayedin full canonicals and assisted by Fathers Crespi , Parron and Gomez , holding a special church service for those who were about to leave for Lower California . A holy Mass had been sung , a short sermon delivered , and as a fitting close for the ninth day of public prayers all joined in singing that thrilling anthem , " Te Deum Laudamus . " That same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the western horizon , loud cries were heard from all parts of the mission compound , and every member of the expeditionwas astonished at seeing a huge sailing ship  --  at least so it appeared in the distance  --  passing by the entrance to the harbor , sailing northward . Four days later this self-same ship ( she was the San Antonio bound for Monterey , but due to an accidentwas obliged to turn back to San Diego for repairs ) for the second time came sailing into the bayp 199of San Diego , and the good Father Serra 's prayers were answered . There was great rejoicing , and the preparations that had been made for their return trip to Lower California served instead for their second march to Monterey.  |p200Serra  's Prayers AnsweredMAGICAL change was wrought at San Diego bythe return of the San Antonio . Despair gaveway to hope , and discouragement to newly awakened enthusiasm . Letters brought in by the San Antonio , dating back from one to two years , gave their recipients interesting information about Lower California , Mexico , Spain and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far-away Russia , where , Don Joseph de Galvez mentioned , Count Lacy , the newly appointed Spanish ambassador to the court of Catherine the Great , had replaced the Marquis de Herreria . The letters Captain Portola received from Galvez and the Mexican viceroy , the Marquis de Croix , gave him a different view of the California situation , and he was now quite anxious to start on his return march to Monterey , and even more anxious to quit this desolate country and his tiresome and uninteresting job and return to Mexico and civilization , where he hoped , beforereturning to Spain , to spend many happy days with old-time friends and enjoy such pleasures as life still had in store for him . Portola knew , however , that this could not be done until Monterey was occupied . After the occupation of that port and the territory of Altap 201California taken possession of in the name of King Carlos , of Spain , he could then turn over his command to Lieutenant Fages , according to Don Jose de Galvez'sinstructions , and he would be free to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Father Serra , a lengthy account was given to the deplorable conditions of affairs in Lower California . Palou also stated that Galvez was opposed to giving up the Loreto mission , which had been under contemplation , as that was the first of all the missions established by the Jesuits in Lower California . " He insisted , " wrote Father Palou , " that I not only act as the Father Presidentof the Lower California missions , but likewise take personal charge of the Loreto mission . Naturally , I consented to accept his suggestions . However , due to the extraordinary and arbitrary changes that were ordered to be put into effect by Galvez , the Lower California missions are rapidly disintegrating , and unlessthese conditions are promptly remedied , all our missions will have to be abandoned . " In a second letter from Palou to Serra , received at the same time , Palou wrote , " It may surprise you to learn that the newly appointed governor for the Californias , Don Matias de Armona , arrived in Loreto on June 12 , 1769 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which I fully explained to him , and realizing that it would be impossible for him to carry out his instructions regarding them , he disgustedlythrew up his job and returned to San Blas on June 24 , on the same ship ( Galeto ) that brought him to Loreto . So the sergeant-major , Don Juan Guitierrez , who had been acting governor since Captain Portola 's departure , March 9 , 1769 , was again placed in charge . " The return of the San Antonio was of far greater importance to Serra than to all the others who lined the shore of that beautiful land-locked harbor , watchingthe welcome relief-ship , that all had so anxiously been waiting for , come sailing into the bay . To Serra the coming of the San Antonio was a living answer to his prayers , a vindication of his faith in God . Although never despairing , the ship came as a messenger of hope . On the night of that great day , while alone in his simply furnished cabin , Father Serra , kneeling in humble piety before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , body and soul as a simple follower in the footsteps of his seraphic father St. Francis , to faithfully serve God to the end of his days . It was the greatest moment of his life , this midnightcommunion with the Spirit of the Man of Galilee , whom on bended knees he so earnestly begged to serve . Whereas the return of the San Antonio made possiblethe early completion of Captain Portola 's service in California , to Father Serra it marked the beginning of the service he would now be able to undertake for the spiritual uplift of the native Indians , which had been halted by so many untoward circumstances.  |p203The  California Indians BEFORE the Portola expedition started on its overland journey in search of the port of Monterey , on July 14 , 1769 , Serra had asked both Sergeant Jose de Ortega and Don Miguel Costanso , the engineer , to make as close a study as possible of the natives a1ong their route . As both of these capable and observing officers were members of the Diarist 's Club , they willingly consented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own . Up to the day of the timely arrival of the San Antoniowith the greatly needed supplies , neither Costansonor Ortega had made any report of their studies of the natives to Father Serra , and it was not until they learned that their friend was to sail in a few days on the San Antonio for Monterey that they informed him they were ready to give him a brief account of their observations of the Alta California savages . Sergeant Ortega was the first to make his report . " I found , " he said , as he opened up his diary , " that there was no marked difference between the pagans of the north and those of the San Diego bay region or , in fact , of those in Lower California . Nor is there much difference among any of them physically , mentally or morally . They all live in a wretched way . Most of them are extremely stupid , brutish , filthy , and too lazy to work . I only noted a single exception in our travels . As we reached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that section , both men and women , who were more industrious , and with the crudestof implements , they fashion many useful articles . Their manner of living , however , does not vary perceptiblyfrom that of the other tribes to the north and south of them . " I noticed that some of the southern savages have a darker complexion , due possibly to climatic conditions . As we advanced northward , we found the natives more kindly disposed toward us . In fact , they were too friendly , if anything . All seemed to be fond of singing , dancing and gambling , especially gambling . Most of them live , or at least sleep , in brushwood huts . There is no privacy , except that I noticed at most of the rancherias they have sweathouses , which are barred to the women , and used by the men for various purposes . These huts or wigwams are larger than any of the others , and are daubed over with mud . There is an opening at the top to let out the smoke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to crawl in . There is a pit in the center where a fire is kept burning during the winter months . This is merely an outline of some features of the Indian 's mode of living that attracted my attention and could be greatly elaborated . " " It is certainly interesting , Sergeant , and I thank you for your kind attention to my request . I am sure that Senor Costanso will also be able to give us somep205enlightening information in his study of the natives . " " It would , I know , Father Serra , " said Costanso , " take up too much of your time to give you a detailed report of my study and observation of the numerous bands of savages I came in contact with since leaving Lower California . I have devoted many pages of my diary to this work . I agree , however , with what SergeantOrtega has said about them . " Fortunately , in most of my contacts with these savages , I was accompanied by the mulatto arriero ( muleteer ) , Pablo Rosario @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ linguist , and speaks a number of dialects used by the Indians , and in many instances I was able , with his assistance , to obtain information at first hand . One thing that astonished me was the large number of dialectsused by the natives of Alta California . I kept track of them up to twelve and then gave it up . The fact that Rosario could speak various Indian languages gained him many friends among the savages , and no doubt the attention paid to him turned his head , and he finally deserted . By this time he has probably fenced off his own Garden of Eden or been elected chief of one of the numerous rancherias . " I tried to get some information as to where their ancestors came from , but they did n't know . Now and then one would point to the north and the others toward the south . At times , I have come to the conclusion that they were the descendants of a prehistoric people , but I could find no facts on which to base this theory . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are not descendants of a single tribe . If they were , there would be fewer dialects spoken by them . " Although we reached a latitude about thirty-eight degrees north , we found the men going about without clothes . In very cold weather they would cover their bodies with mud or resort to the sweathouses . Their squaws would make temporary use of furs to protect themselves against cold weather or heavy rains . Their weapons consist of bows and arrows , spears , pointed wooden swords and knotted clubs . " Nowhere did we find that any of the natives had ever cultivated the soil . They eat everything animate or inanimate , from a coyote to a flea , a worm to a snake , a whale to a sardine , a wildcat to a lion or a humming-bird to a buzzard , the one exception being the rattlesnake , which many refuse to eat . They eat their food raw or cooked , depending altogether on their degree of hunger . To this elaborate bill of fare , they add acorns , certain kinds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and nuts . To gather their food and prepare it they use different kinds of baskets . " I found no trace of religion or worship of any kind or description . They know neither God nor devil . They have , however , sorcerers or medicine men among them . To call these sorcerers devils might be more appropriate , as they are up to all kinds of deviltry . Their word is law among the members of the rancherias and they rule them wholly through fear . " " Marriage is a matter of selection , minus the cere-p 207molly . If a man sees a woman he wants and she is satisfied to live with him , it constitutes marriage . A divorce is just as easily arranged , the children , if any , going with the mother . There is a certain amount of affection shown by the parents for their offspring , but hardly any more than is shown by wild beasts . Little attention is paid to the sick , and the dead are quickly forgotten . " Every rancheria ( Indian hamlet ) has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accept any statement they make with many grains of salt . Very few of the natives can be trusted and all are inclined to he treacherous . The Indian believes in the common ownership of property , but he wants to be the owner . " I found most of the California Indians notoriously timid and cowardly , and quite unlike the savages I met in Sonora and other parts of New Spain . Indeed , most of them can only be compared to the untamed beasts that roam the forests  --  going about from place to place in search of food . Their virtues , Father Serra , I am afraid , are not numerous , and I leave them for you and your fellow missionaries to discover . " " I am sure , my dear Costanso , we shall find them even though they lie deeply buried in the hidden recesses of their unawakened minds . I thank you , most sincerely , for your fine report . " " I have given you merely a bare outline , dear Father , of these degraded beings who have lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God 's anointed , who , with magic touch , will bring sight to their unseeing eyes and eternal salvation to the lowliest of these ignorant savages . " " Beautifully expressed , Senor Costanso , and it is to be our great blessing to mold , out of this mean clay , God-revering men and women . From the meanest and lowest of these degraded and ignorant savages , with the help of His Divine Majesty , we hope to gain a potential follower of Jesus Christ  --  the head of a Christian family , a husbandman , a carpenter , a blacksmith , a weaver , a tailor , a shoemaker , a hewer of wood , a drawer of water , a mason , a bricklayer , a maker of adobes , a laborer , a builder of homes , and all that is needed to bring about this transformation will be their spiritual and mental awakening , and behold , out of the coarsest and poorest of these clays there will come forth upstanding men and women , reborn in the image of their Creator . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be taught how to work and pray and bow their heads in adoration of a living God . "  |p209Bound  for Monterey ALTHOUGH the San Antonio reached San Di ( on the twenty-third day of March , 1770 , was not able to leave before the sixteenth day April , due to the loss of her anchor at sea , which N replaced by a new one made by the San Diego Jose Lorenzo Esperza . Sailing on this vessel , under command of Captain Juan Perez , with Don Miguel Pino as his first officer , were Father Serra , Mig Costanso , Dr. Pedro Prat , and presumptively Cam de Ortega , Ignacio and his wife , Marta , two mechani three muleteers , six Indian neophytes and five servants . Owing to contrary winds , the San Antonio did t reach Monterey until the thirty-first day of May . Captain Portola left San Diego on his second jo ney northward in search of the famous port of M ( terey on April seventeenth and reached his destinati on May 24 , 1770 , making this long and tiresome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to him to reach the mouth of the Salinas River on his first march northward . Among those leaving with Portola were Lieutena Fages , Father Juan Crespi , twelve Catalonian volunteer soldiers , seven leather-jacket soldiers and five me phyte Indians from Lower California . They followed the same route previously traveled , and as they were not burdened with a long sick list and had but a comparativelysmall amount of supplies to transport , no marshes to fill , no roads to build , and fine weather , they made rapid headway . This time they had no trouble in locating the port of Monterey , the outlines of which had not changed a particle since it was visited by Cabrera Bueno and Sebastian Vizcaino . These early navigators told them that it resembled the half of the letter " 0 , " and , sure enough , there it was staring them in the face . Just a week later the San Antonio dropped anchor in this beautiful harbor . There were left at San Diego , Captain Vila , with his first mate and five sailors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight leather-jacket soldiers , ten neophyte Indians , and Fathers Parron and Gomez , the two missionaries in charge of the mission . The San Diego force , however , was augmented in July of the same year ( 1770 ) by the arrival of Captain Rivera , Corporal Rocha and nineteen additional leather-jacket soldiers , two muleteers and a few Indian neophytes , in charge of a string of eighty mules laden with supplies , a herd of one hundred and sixty-four cattle , some sheep and a few goats.  |p211Two  Great Events JUNE 3 , 1770 , was a great day for the kingdom of Spain . It also happened to be Pentecost Sunday , and became known to historians as the day on which Captain Gaspar de Portola took formal possessionof that vast territory henceforth to be known as Alta California . It was also to become known as the day on which Father Serra dedicated the mission of San Carlos Borromeo de Monterey , the second mission to be established in California . Later on , when the mission was moved over to Carmelo Bay , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and now called the Carmel mission . Every preparation for the founding of the new missionhad been made in advance . These preparations were simple enough , but what they lacked in many essentials was made up by the picturesque location for this new place of worship . A bower made up of innumerablebranches , interwoven with wild flowers , had been erected , and its altar bedecked with costly church decorations . Bells were hung on a nearby tree , a cross had been built and was ready to be set up . Holy water , in a good-sized vessel , that had been blessed by the fathers , was close at hand . Cannons were mounted and properly primed for firing . Soldiers , fully armed and ready for the tasks assigned to them , were stationed at vantage points . To complete the picture , they had the ocean and bay before them , a cloudless sky above , and , with the whispering west winds to temper the sun 's rays , it made an ideal California day . From a nearby cabin came Fathers Serra and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way to the place selected for the new mission . They were followed by two Indian neophytes ( all from Lower California ) clothed in choir gowns , and these were followed by Captain Portola , Lieutenant Fages and the soldiers . Then came Captain Juan Perez , Don Miguel del Pino and the sailors of the San Antonio , and bringingup the rear were Miguel Costanso , Jose Canizares , Dr. Prat and other members of the expeditions . After lustily ringing the bells for some minutes , those attending the ceremony formed a half-circle about the fathers , and the dedicatory services began . Following the chanting of the " Veni Creator Spiritus " came the planting and the blessing of the cross , then the sprinkling of the land surrounding the mission with holy water and the singing of a high Mass . There was a short sermon by Father Serra , and after that the soulstirringwords of the " Te Deum Laudemus , " which all joined in singing , and , as a fitting finale , the startling salvos of cannon shots , the discharge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loud huzzas of the men . The second ceremony , in which Spain had even a greater and more important interest , followed shortlyp213after the church service came to an end . The most in portant personage in this historic event was Don Ga par de Portola , captain of dragoons of the regiment c Spain , former Governor of Lower California and no , commander-in-chief of the expeditions organized by th inspector-general , Don Joseph de Galvez , for th peaceful conquest of Alta California and the protectio of this domain from foreign aggression , and , likewise on this gala occasion , acting as the personal represent tive of His Majesty King Carlos III of Spain , in whos name he had been ordered to take formal possession a this vast territory . Again there was a vigorous ringing of the church hells . Again the men formed in line and marched toward the bay shore , where they halted before a newl erected flagpole . Here they formed a half circle facin the bay , while certain religious and civil formalitie were duly complied with . Next followed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an elalaborately worded scroll , which signature was attested b Captain Juan Perez and Don Miguel del Pino of th San flntonio . This was followed by the throwing o some upturned earth and stones to all points of th compass , and the hoisting and unfurling of the Spanish flag by Don Gaspar himself . Once more came the salvos of cannon shots , the discharge of muskets , the ringing of bells and the shouts and noisy huzzas of th , soldiers , sailors and neophytes . With the hoisting of Spain 's flag on the soil at Mon terey , Portola 's work in California virtually came to an end . The third and most interesting event of the day to most of the officers and men of the expeditions who took part in the founding of the new mission and the occupationof California was the serving of California 's first banquet . Undoubtedly a most delectable affair that must have been hugely enjoyed by all of King Carlos 's guests . There were tables , that had been brought from the San Antonio , spread for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Indians . With the fresh supplies brought from San Blas by the San Antonio , there was an abundance of food , which did not include any mule steaks or mule stews . It would have been interesting to our modern dieticiansif a copy of the bill of fare had been preserved , and with so many diarists present ( Serra , Crespi , Fages , Portola , Perez and Costanso , all of whose diarieshave been published ) it was surprising that not one of them thought of including in his journal a list of the viands and vinos that were served on that momentous occasion . It would also have been interesting and informative if we could have had verbatim copies of the afterdinnerspeeches of Portola , Serra , Crespi , Fages , Perez and del Pino ; all well educated and capable men , who , no doubt , regaled those present with many humorous and tragic accounts of their personal experiences . We know it was an eventful day , and it was probably at the 215banquet table that Captain Portola turned over his command @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took physicalpossession of Alta California her army of occupationconsisted of less than forty-five soldiers . Including the mission fathers , mechanics , laborers , muleteers , servants and Christianized Indians , Spain 's total force in California at that time amounted to less than seventy-fivemen . This number was increased to about one hundred men in July , 1770 , by the return of Captain Rivera 's expedition from Lower California . These figuresdid not include any of the sailors or the ship 's officers . The fact that Spain effected her physical conquestof California with little effort or expense and virtuallyno bloodshed , was greatly to her credit . The next and equally important step was to achieve California 's spiritual conquest , and for this work it is doubtful whether Spain , if she had searched the world over , could have found a better man than that valiant defender of his faith , Father Junipero Serra , known in his youth for his brilliant attainments as a scholar , and esteemed for his ability as a preacher . He gave up a most promising career that assured him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat of a cardinal , to devote himself to the life of a missionary in the wilds of New Spain and the Californias , willingly forsaking his friends , his family ties , his physical comfortsand peaceful days and nights , for a cape , a cowl and a pair of sandals , with a fare often so meager that even a poorhouse inmate would have turned from it in disgust . And it was to this zealous soul-saving apostle of the seraphic father St. Francis , Father Junipero Serra , and his valiant band of missio:taries that Spain had intrustedthis great work  --  the spiritual conquest of the natives of her new empire , Alta California . P219Beginning the Spiritual Conquest H OW fortunate it was for the California Indiansthat so great a man as Father Serra was willing to sacrifice every comfort , and even his life , if necessary , to bring these poor wretches to a more human understanding of life . Ignorant as these pagans were even of the simplest rudiments of savage life , their regeneration was not to prove an easy task . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and assistance of other equally capable , sincere , self-sacrificing and devout members of the Franciscan order , all of them anxious and eager to devote their lives to bring about the conversion of these benighted savages to Christianity . There are no brighter or more illuminating pages in California 's history than those appertaining to the lives and labors of the Franciscan Fathers , Junipero Serra , Firmin Francisco Lasuen , Francisco Palou , her first historian , Luis Jaime , her first martyr , Juan Crespi , Vincente Fuster and a host of others who came from France , Germany , Italy , Spain and other European countries , armed with nothing but the symbol of their Saviour , all bearing His Message of eternal life even to these lowly outcasts of a thousand generations of a primitive people who contested their rights with the wild beasts of the forests for the most loathsomeof foods necessary to sustain life . It was for these ignorant savages that Father Serra and his brave band of missionaries were ready and eager to give their lives in order that they might be taught a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spiritual conquest of Alta California was to be of slow growth . This was due , largely , to lack of soldiers to guard and protect the missions and missionaries ; the need of funds for new buildings ; additionalmissionaries , laborers , mechanics and artisans . And last , but not least , supplies of all kinds . However , five very important events in the history of California'smissions had been chronicled since Fray Junipero Serra arrived in Alta California : the founding of the mission San Diego de Alcala on July 16 , 1769 ; the mission San Carlos Boromeo on June 3 , 1770 ; the mission San Antonio de Padua on July 14 , 1771 ; the mission San Gabriel Arcangel on September 8 , 1771 ; and the mission San Luis Obispo de Toloso on September 1 , 1772 . Then came a startling piece of news that was to have an important bearing in the advancement of the spiritual conquest of the California Indians . Letters were received containing information about an agreement that had been entered into between the DominicanVicar , Reverend Father Fray Juan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the 221College of San Fernando , a Franciscan Institution in Mexico City . Briefly , in said agreement the Franciscan fathers agreed to retire from and turn over all the Lower California missions to the Dominicans . This agreement served to release all the Franciscan padres located in the Peninsula , thus relieving the shortage of sorely needed missionaries in Alta California , and permitting the replacement of such fathers as were incapacitated by illness , and those who were anxious , tom return to their mother college . This release also brought about the transfer to Alta California of two eminent Franciscans , Fathers Palou and Lasuen , who were to attain great prominence by their labor in behalf of the spiritual uplift of the California Indians . Both were men of unusual ability who , together with Father Serra , well deserved the encomiumshistorians have honored them with . The time and labor these three worthy disciples of the seraphic father St. Francis devoted to this herculean task , covereda period of thirty-four years ; beginning with the advent of Father Serra in 1769 and ending with the death of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still another man  --  California'sunknown hero  --  who played a major part in the conquest of this vast territory . Not a single deed in all of Spain 's glorious history  --  and she had many to be deeply proud of  --  can be compared to this unknown hero 's act . Yet the land that gave him birth does notp222even know his name , and he lies buried in an unmarked and unknown grave . Unwept , unhonored and unsung . At the San Diego mission a slow , but steady advance had been made . A number of Indians had been converted , and , largely out of curiosity , others were beginning to come into the mission compound . They had heard surprising tales from the neophytes about a wonderful man who healed the sick , caused the blind to see , and raised the dead to life . They called him the Son of God . Never having had any knowledge of religion or religious worship , all these things were difficult for the Indian to understand . The melodious singing appealed to them . Music stirred something indefinable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chanting of the " Veni Creator Spiritus . " Their first view of the holy pictures thrilled and startled them . The finely embroidered church vestments awakened a desire to possess them . While the friendly greetings of the fathers and their numerousgifts of clothing , food , and drink , as well as the care given to their sick and dying made a strong impressionupon their slowly awakening minds , and graduallythey came in ones or twos , many from distant rancherias , anxious to join with other neophytes . Martin Reyes , one of the soldier guards at the San Diego mission , and Fernando , the Indian lad , whom he had saved from drowning , had become great friends . Fernando , who , at that time , had been left in care of the mission fathers , by the Indian ChiefP 223Topanque , soon manifested an unusual aptitude for study and quickly mastered the intricacies of the Spanishlanguage , and became quite proficient in other studies . In addition to all this he was a likeable lad and popular with the mission fathers , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deeply interested in Fernando and , aside from his studies , he taught him all kinds of outdoor exercises , so that he soon became an expert marksman , horseman , boxer and artisan . Fernando was not ungrateful and in many ways he tried to show his appreciation . In return he taught Reyes , Machado and Father Amurrio , his native tongue , or at least he tried to . Reyes mastered it fairly well , but Machado balked at the gutturals and Father Amurrio 's work interfered with his lessons . Topanque was not unmindful of his son . He came to see him at least once a year and was well pleased with his progress . There were no letters . They had other ways of communicating . Word came of unrest . Topanque 's message asked for his son 's return , and a request that Senor Reyes , Father Amurrio and ManuelMachado come with his son for a long visit . Fernando looked to Reyes for the answer to his father 's message . " Tell Abascal that we will be pleased to go with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and as soon as this can be done we will send word to your father . " " I understand , Senor Reyes , " Fernando replied . " Father Serra will no doubt sanction Father Amur- rio 's visit , and I feel confident that Corporal Rocha will get a permit from Fages or Ortega for myself and Machado , so that we can go with Father Amurrio as his guards . " " That will be fine , Senor Reyes . I know that my people will be pleased to have you come . " " You had better see to it , Fernando , that Abascal is supplied with what food he will need for his return journey and give him this silver coin with my compliments . And be sure to have him tell your people that we send them our friendly greetings . He is also to tell your dear sister , Natooka , that I hope to see her soon . " " I 'll see that he does , Senor Reyes . " " Tell him , he must not forget , Senora Cojuati @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fernando were visiting Fathers Jaime and Fuster , who had replaced Fathers Parron and Gomez at the San Diego mission . They came to tell the fathers of Topanque 's invitation to visit his rancheria . This was pleasing news and Father Jaime told them that he would write Father Serra at once and ask his consent to allow Father Amurrio to go with Fernando , as he believed it would bring about the conversion of many of Topanque 's tribe . While they were still discussing this matter , Corporal Rocha entered the room . He had just returned from a visit to the San Gabriel mission and brought back some very interesting news from the north . As Juan was temporarily in charge of the San Diego presidio heP 225assured both fathers that there would be no objection to Reyes and Machado going to Topanque 's rancheria , as guards for Father Amurrio . " In the meantime , " Juan stated , " I shall write to Captain Fages and inform him of my action which I know he will approve . I stall also ask him to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Reyes thanked Juan , and bidding the fathers good night , all but Juan returned.to the barracks . Naturally , both Jaime and Fuster wanted to hear the latest news about the San Gabriel mission , but no sooner had the corporal started to speak than Pepe and Juanito , son and nephew of Sergeant Ortega , came in to recite their lessons to Father Jaime . So Juan was obliged to wait until after the boys got through . However , . all this fitted in very nicely with Juan 's plans , and he was in no hurry to leave . In fact , he hoped that one of the fathers would suggest they play a game of chess , of which Juan was inordinately fond . There was still another reason why Juan did not want to leave . Both Fathers Jaime and Fuster knew of Juan 's secret betrothal to Camila Ortega , and quite often they were able to please Juan with information contained in letters received from Father Serra . Not having had any news about Camila for several weeks he was anxious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Serra lately . No sooner had the Ortega boys finished their lessonsthan Father Jaime suggested Juan join him in , P226a game of chess , but before they started the game , Juan told them many interesting bits of news about the San Gabriel mission , and then surprised them with the information given him by Father Lasuen , that Serra , in a recent letter stated that the necessary funds would be forthcoming for the building of a new mission , to be erected midway between San Gabriel and San Diego . This greatly pleased both Jaime and Fuster and would greatly hearten Father Amurrio , when he heard of it , as it was understood that he was to be one of the missionariesto have charge of the mission . Shortly after the game started , and a few moves had been made , Juan noticed that Father Jaime was thinking of something far more important than a game of chess . Juan believed he knew what Father Jaime was thinking about and offered him the proverbial penny for his thoughts . " Your price is too low , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wondering why the Indianchief , Topanque , has invited Father Amurrio to pay him a visit . Am I right ? " " It was not a bad guess , Juan . What made you think about it ? " " You may remember Father Jaime , when Topanque and a dozen or more members of his tribe were here about a year ago on their customary fishing trip that nearly all of them were anxious to become Christians . But at that time Father Amurrio was busy proselyting at some distant rancheria , and there was no one else you could send along to teach them the necessaryP 227rudiments of our faith , and it was impossible for you to care for them at the mission . " " Yes , yes  --  now that you speak of it , Juan , I do recall it , and how at that time I greatly regretted our inability to accede to their request* , I also remember how favorably I was impressed with the type of Indiansbelonging to Topanque 's tribe , and I felt confidentthat they would become faithful followers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are right , Father Jaime . It would surprise you to see how they have improved in their personal habits  --  in the cultivation of their lands  --  in the more attractive construction of their huts  --  since we first met Fernando 's people . Much of this has been done on their own initiative , which , in itself , is indicativeof future progress . " " That is interesting , indeed , " Father Jaime admitted . " If you do n't object , Juan , I 'll let Father Fuster take my place , while I write a few lines to our dear Father Serra . " " Not at all , and if you do n't object , Father Jaime , I should like to have you inclose a letter of mine , with yours . " " No objections at all , Juan , provided , of course , it is not too bulky and you agree to pay the carriage charges , " was the father 's humorous response . " Willingly , Father ; but as I am goi to carry it as far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a discount . " " That 's fair enough , " agreed Father Jaime . " When do you intend to leave ? "   " Not for several days . " " You want to be sure , Juan , " Father Fuster jokinglyremarked , " to see that Father Jaime seals his letter properly . " " Pay no attention to what Father Fuster says , Juan , " Father Jaime fired back at him , " he is judging others by himself . Particularly , when he is figuring out some new chess move . " " You mean he indulges in reveries ? " Juan answered . Halting the game once more , Father Fuster whispered to Juan , " Jesting aside  --  I have a confession to make . I once opened one of your letters to your betrothed , in order to properly fit it in with my own to Father Serra , and , unthinkingly , I read the first line wherein you addressed your sweetheart . I admit it was a terrible thing for me to do , and I trust you will forgive me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sacred and inviolate . " " With all my heart , Father , but I want both you and Father Jaime , to know that you are welcome to read any of my letters to my dear Camila ; in fact I would like to have you read them , as I know she would not object . We are both deeply indebted to you , and to dear Father Serra , for your many kind acts . You have helped to brighten the dark days that lay before us , and have shown us how to look upon this long delay , not only as a test of our love and affection , but as a means of broadening our outlook on life and its responsibilities as well . We are no longer downcast and doubtful as to the outcome , but feel sat-p 229isfied and contented to leave our future in God 's hands . " " That is the right view to take , Juan , " said Father Jaime , as he laid down his quill , " you will find that life 's greatest lessons are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young man yet , and the best years of your life still lie before you . And as the years go by , my son , always remember that he who has faith in God will never be forsaken by Him . We both sincerely sympathize with you and your betrothed , and we believe that a happy future will yet be yours . We also want to assure you , Juan , that Father Fuster and I both appreciate and thank you for your filial regard for us . " " To all of which I will say amen , and may God bless you , my dear Juan , " Father Fuster added . " Whose move is it ? " Juan inquired after thanking both the fathers . " It is my move , " Father Amurrio called out , as he entered the room and greeted the fathers and Corporal Rocha . Then turning to Brother Jaime , " What is this I have heard about my going to Topanque 's rancheria with his son , Fernando ? " " Would you like to go ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so sure you would , Brother Amurrio , that in my letter to Father Serra , I have asked that he consent to your going . " " That was very kind of you , and if it is not imposingupon you , would you mind asking him if he hasp230had any further word about the founding of the San Juan Capistrano mission. ? " " No reason why I should n't even though we have just been told by Corporal Rocha that only a few days ago , Father Lasuen , received a letter from Father Serra , in which he stated that funds for the building would soon be forthcoming . So , my inquiry may bring us additional information . " " I sincerely hope it will . I have been looking forward to the time when I shall see its stout walls rise heavenward , and its deep-toned bells calling the lowly savage to its chancel rail , where I , as one of its missionaries , may kneel with them and humbly ask God 's mercy and forgiveness . " P231Camila at Monterey I N the San Carlos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erected near the mission church which Camila had been sharing with Ignacioand Marta , ever since the mission was moved from Monterey to its present location . Camila , greatly improvedin health , and now a very beautiful young woman , was doing some sewing . Dr. Prat and Fathers Serra and Crespi , who had just come in , were seated at the table opposite Camila . Serra had a package in his hand which , upon being undone , revealed a number of letters . At a glance he picked up Father Jaime 's , and , on opening it , he found a missive enclosed addressed to Senorita Ortega , which he handed to her , with a cheerful smile . They all knew that it was a letter from Juan , but no comment was made as Camila , blushingslightly , found a hiding place for it . The receipt of letters or communications of any kind in Spain 's outermost colonies were rare events and everyone connected with mission or presidio was anxious to hear from relatives or friends of their home towns , or pick up some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing how deeply interested everyone was about news from the outside world , Father Serra was always willing to share his letters with his friends , providing they were not marked " confidential , " or the contents were not of such a nature as to prohibit their being divulged . As Serra pulled out a neatly folded handkerchieffrom an inside pocket he said , " Now if you will be patient while I clean my eyeglasses , I 'll read you Father Jaime 's letter , knowing that you are all interestedas to what is going on at the San Diego mission . " " Why not let Camila clean your spectacles , " Dr. Prat suggested . " Yes , let me clean them , Father . " " No , no , my daughter . Dr. Prat is  --  well , what shall I say  --  hurrying me  --  or trying to tease me  --  but I have become immune . Just a moment more  --  there is one more grease spot that I must rub off  --  now they are all right . ( Spreads out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beloved Father President Junipero Serra , " Greetings and best wishes : " It may please you to learn that a mighty ambassador , Prince Abascal , arrived this day from the court of the great Indian chief , Topanque , bringing word from that doughty chieftain to his son , our beloved neophyte , Fernando , requesting him to return home . At the same time , Topanque , not forgetful of his debt of gratitude , nor of his love and great regard for our faithful son , Martin Reyes , nor his esteem for our beloved Brother Amurrio , who has just returned from the San Luis Obispo mission , included in his message a request ( in/vitation might be a more fitting word ) to have both of them pay a visit to his court , assuring them a most graciouswelcome . Nor has he forgotten our faithful and beloved son , Manuel Machado , who is expected to go with Reyes and Father Amurrio . Corporal Rocha , who has just returned from San Gabriel , approves of Reyes and Machado 's going with Fernando , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers going as guards for Brother Amurrio . As we all feel that Amurrio'svisit may serve to gain us a number of converts , I trust that you will sanction our request and allow him to accompany Fernando to Topanque 's rancheria . " During the absence of Reyes and Machado , CorporalRocha has kindly consented to personally supervisethe mission guards . This , we know , will meet with your approval . Senorita Ortega may be pleased to learn that her two nephews , Pepe and Juanito , are now with us and are doing very well , both in their studies and in their fealty to our tenets . They show many lovabletraits and are a constant joy to their teachers . The good Father Amurrio does not have time to dream of castles in Spain , as you well know ; but in his mind 's eye he frequently visions a glorious mission building that is to be named San Juan Capistrano , and he has asked if you will foretell the day this dream child of his is to have its glorious birth ? Have you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Corporal Rocha and , I am sure , many others who are deeply indebted to this worthy follower of our seraphic father St. Francis ,  | would be pleased to hear of his recovery from his very painful wound . " We all love you , dear Father Serra , and trust His Divine Majesty will guard and protect you , and hold you in His keeping . " To our good brother , Father Crespi , and the kindheartedDr . Prat , we beg to be kindly remembered . Also to Senorita Ortega , whom I was not able to meet while at Monterey . " Believe me , your most humble and faithful servant who kisses your hand and asks your prayers and blessingin the name of our beloved Saviour . " Ever yours , in our holy faith , " Father Luis Jaime . ' " " What a beautiful letter , Father Serra , " said Camila . " I should like to meet Father Jaime , and hope to have that pleasure some day . " " I am sure that you would like him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved by everyone who knows him , and the Indian neophytes at the San Diego mission fairly worship him . " " That is true , Doctor . Endowed , as he is , with every God-like quality , I have never known a man more worthy to serve Him who died to save us . His words to the sick and suffering are like the miraculous manna that sustained the starving Israelites in their hour of need . Meek and lowly , seeing only that which is best in man 's nature , he finds something praiseworthy in the meanest and lowest of mankind , and strives to serveP235them . His is a nature that the world 's greatest kings might envy . Of him it may truly be said , He is one of the Lord 's anointed . " " Sorry to disturb this friendly meeting  --  " " Why , Jose ! Where in the world did you come from ? " Camila called out to her brother , as he entered the cabin . After kissing his sister and shaking hands with Fathers Serra , Crespi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I returned to Monterey last night from San Luis Obispo and a two days ' visit at the mission San Antonio . The fathers all asked to be remembered to you . Everyone seemed to be enjoying good health , and at both missions they reported many additional converts , as you have probably heard , Father Serra . " " Their letters to me have been very encouraging , " Serra admitted , " and I am very happy indeed with the progress we are now making . I know , my dear Ortega , that you will want to visit with your sister , so I am sure you will excuse us . If convenient , Sergeant , I 'd like to have a talk with you before you return to Monterey . " " I 'll be only too happy , Father , to talk things over with you . " Then turning to Camila , as Serra , Crespi and the doctor left the room , Jose again kissed and embraced his sister , and , as he noted her improvement , remarked , " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and growing more beautiful every day . " " Do you really think so , Jose ? "  --  sparkling gladness dancing in her eyes.  | " I certainly do . It seems to me you have also gained in weight since I have been away . I brought you two fine Indian baskets which I thought would please you . " " That was very kind of you , Jose , and I thank you , both for the baskets and your kind remembrance . " " What was Father Serra talking about , as I came in , Camila ? " " Mostly about Father Jaime , from whom he had received a charming letter , in which he stated that the Indian Chief Topanque had invited Father Amurrio and Martin Reyes to pay him a visit . He also spoke very kindly of Pepe and Juanito . Both fathers seem to think very well of them . " " Their letters to me are most encouraging , " said Jose ; " and I know both Jaime and Fuster will take good care of our boys . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom he , with the assistance of CaptainFages , had managed to keep away from Monterey and Rio Carmelo . In this , however , he was mistaken . In an idle talk Jose had with his sister , he mentioned a very interesting conversation he had had with Captain Fages about California conditions generally , and how the commander finally switched the subject around to her . " He told me , said Jose , " that he called on you a number of times and that he had fallen deeply in love with you , and is anxious to marry you , if I , your guardian , would give my consent . I told him , quite candidly , Camila , that I would gladly give my consent and wouldp 237consider it an honor to have him as a brother-in-law , but that I had better talk the matter over with you first and find out what you thought about it . This is a great opportunity for you , Camila , and I should like to have you accept the captain . " " Jose , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is true that Captain Fages did call on me , far oftener , in fact , than I cared to have him , and  --  without wanting to be impolite  --  I tried in many ways to discouragehis coming . I know he is a man of ability and , no doubt , destined to attain a much more prominent position than he now holds ; but he does not appeal to me , nor could I ever learn to love him . " I know , Jose , that is going to be a great disappointment to you , which I deeply regret , but you will eventuallyget over it and forgive your Camilita . " Jose fully realized that no argument he could advancewould cause his sister to change her mind , once it was made up . He had found that out years ago , but he was not quite ready to give up trying to have it his way ; and without showing much concern , he suggested , " Why not take a few days ' time to think it over and let me tell the commander @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this at once ? " " It would not be fair to Captain Fages . " " Then what am Ito tell him ? " " Why not tell him the truth ? " " What  --  that you still love Juan , whom I thought you had long since forgotten ? " " Yes , Jose , tell him that I still love Juan . Nor has he ever been forgotten ; but in consideration of your feelings , I have never mentioned him to you . But Juan knows that I love him , and I know that he loves me , and some day we mean to be married . " " You certainly deceived me . To think of your wanting to marry an ordinary soldier , when you could have the pick of a dozen or more of the most eminent men in New Spain . Well you are not yet of age , and you may change your mind . " " No , I do n't intend to change my mind , Jose . " " It is not going to be a very agreeable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fages that  --  I am sorry , dear sir , but my sister refuses to accept the great honor you would confer upon her , because she is in love with Corporal Rocha . ' " " I would change that somewhat , proud brother of mine , and say , I regret to inform you , dear sir , that my sister sincerely appreciates the great honor you would bestow upon her , but as her heart is engaged elsewhere , she can not accept you . ' " " It is no joking matter with him , and I must manage , somehow , to sweeten the bitter pill . " P239What the Fathers Had toFight Against LATE in the afternoon at a rancheria , about halfway J between Monterey and Carmelo , a number of Indians were quietly attending to their own affairs , wholly unaware of any danger , when , suddenly , one of the savages came rushing into their midst , cryingout in alarm , " Soldados ! soldados ! " ( Soldiers ! soldiers ! ) while close upon his heels a half dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as they came nearer , they fired their muskets , intending thus to frighten the natives and drive them off toward a distant hillside . The single word " Soldados ! " was so weighted with fear as to cause the savages to scurry in all directions , seeking various hiding places , and all but one managed to escape . A young and attractive squaw , the wife of the chief of the rancheria , who had been at work in her wigwam was not so fortunate . She was caught by one of the soldiers who rode her down as she tried to get away . Leaping from his horse , he quickly tied her hands behind her , lifted her up on his horse and carried her off to his cabin near the Monterey presidio . Upon reaching there , he tied up his victim so that she could not possibly escape , and threw her on his cot , leaving   her there  --  a prisoner , to be maltreated at his convenience . There was consternation at the rancheria . The women and children were wailing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen the chief 's squaw carried off and believed she had been murdered . The husband and some of his followers had been off for a day 's fishing . On their return at sunset , they soon learned what had happened , and , gnashing their teeth in rage , they swore to be avenged . The soldier and his captive was soon trailed to their destination , when the chief ordered his followers to retire . After waiting a short time , he saw a soldier approaching  --  enter the cabin , and light a tallow dip , which pointed the way for the husband . Through an opening in the wall he watched the soldier , who , totally indifferent as to what might happen , untied his victim and roughly ordered her to get up . He then tried to caress her , which she resented . Picking up a club he started to beat her , when the maddened husband fired an arrow at him through a chink in the wall and hit him , causing a painful , but not a dangerous , wound . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , quickly grabbing his loaded musket , rushed out through the door , sighted the fleeing Indian , and killed him . A supernumerary connected with the San Carlos mission happened to be in the neighborhood , and heard the whole story of the attempted outrage and the kill/ing of the Indian chief . Accompanied by Ignacio , an ( one of the soldier guards of the mission , he visited the rancheria and showing his sympathy for the savages whom he had visited several times , asked that the widow of the dead chief be allowed to go with him to the mission where she would have the best of care . A ; the Indians agreed to this , they hurried back to Ric Carmelo . Father Serra was quickly informed of the infamous outrage that had taken place ; also of the subsequent arrest of the perpetrator who was to come up for trial the next day at the presidio before the commander-inchief , Captain Fages . " We have brought the poor woman with us , " said the supernumerary to Father Serra , " and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his cabin where his wife , Marta , and the Senorita Ortega are taking care of her . " That Father Serra was deeply moved by this brutal deed of the soldier , Pedro Melos , hardly expressed his feelings . This villainous act was but one of the many handicaps with which the Franciscan fathers had to contend in their efforts to convert the savages to Christianity . Owing to her necessities , Spain was always in need of soldiers to guard and protect her numerous dependencies , and to replenish her standing army . In order to supply this steady demand , she was frequently forced to ' conscript men from convict camps and the city slums of Spain . However , these formed only a fraction of herp242vast army which included many thousands of soldiers recruited from the cream of Spanish youth . The majority of them fine , stalwart men , brave fighters , ready and willing to face any danger , and all manner of hardships , and to sacrifice their lives , if need be , for their king , their country , or their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who marched from Loreto to San Diego and thence to Monterey . Dr. Prat had also heard of the lamentable outrage , and when he learned that the Indian woman had been taken to Marta 's cabin , he called there to see if he could be of any assistance to Camila or Marta . He found that the grief-stricken widow was being well cared for , and left an opiate which he suggested be given to quiet the patient 's nerves and induce sleep and forgetfulness . Knowing that Serra was greatly wrought up about this affair , the doctor called on him and Father Crespi and told them of his visit to the broken-hearted widow , and of Marta and Camila 's sisterly care of her . All were wondering what punishment would be meted out to the soldier who so brazenly defied the laws of God and man . When Captain Portola turned his authority over to Lieutenant ( now Captain ) Fages , after taking possession of California in the name of King Carlos , he also turned over to him certain other rights and privileges , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authority over all the inhabitants , excepting theP243Franciscan fathers , but even these valiant defenders of their faith were , to a certain extent , subject to his authority , although it may have been an usurped authority  --  but it was frequently evident . The trial of Pedro Melos for the killing of the Indian chief , showed Commander-in-Chief Fages in a new light  --  a light that added no luster to his name or fame . In a room in the presidio building at Monterey , Judge Fages was seated at the head of a long table , awaiting the arrival of Corporal Cordero , who had gone to bring in the prisoner . While waiting , the clerk of the court was busy preparing the necessary documents , as a complete record had to be kept of the trial , which was to be a judicial , and not a court-martial , trial . Scattered about the room were a number of soldiers , some Indian neophytes , several savages from the raided rancheria and the supernumerary with the neophyte , Ignacio . As Corporal Cordero entered with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Judge Fages to the prisoner : " What is your name ? " " Pedro Melos , " the prisoner answered . After the accused had been duly sworn , Judge Fages asked , " Pedro Melos , are you guilty or not guilty of having shot and killed the Indian chief ? " " Guilty , Your Honor . But it was in self-defense . " The onlookers were startled . " If you will permit me , Your Honor , " the prisoner went on , starting to roll back his sleeve ( Fages nods consent as Melos bares his arm ) , " I 'll show you that the Indian first shot at me  --   | and he would have killed me if I had not made a quick turn at the time . " Judge Fages : " Do n't you know , Melos , that all of our soldiers have strict orders not to kill any of the savages , except when ordered to do so in a fight ? " Pedro Melos : " Yes , Your Honor , but I did not mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at random . " Judge Fages : " As it is shown and admitted by you , Pedro Melos , that you killed an Indian , I must pronounceyou guilty ; but since it was done without premeditation , you are sentenced to ten days confinement in the guard-house . " After a short pause , " Corporal Cordero , you will remove the prisoner . " As the amazed spectators were leaving , " Is there any other matter to come before the court ? If not , the court stands ad-journed . " P245Disquieting News From Mexico THE dawn of another day brought disquieting news from Mexico City . There was a strong undercurrent of excitement that almost came to a boiling point , when the full report of the trial and the ridiculous sentence of Pedro Melos , which was now temporarily forgotten , reached Father Serra , while the fathers read and re-read the startling news from the Father Guardian , Rafael Verger , of the Franciscan College at Mexico City . The contents of Verger 's communicationmight have such far-reaching results as to cause the abandonment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give up their work and return to their mother college . Viewed from every angle , the situation was a serious one , and , as if to add to its complexities , Captain Fages was seen approaching . Fages 's visit was certainly untimely , but nothing could be done about it . After the usual greetings , he was asked to be seated . To Father Serra , the presence of Captain Fages brought up the subject of Pedro Melos 's trial , and his farcical sentence . Although Serra tried hard to control his feelings he could not help but question Fages : " Is it true , your Honor , that you let Pedro Melos off with a ten days '  | sentence in the guard-house for the killing of the Indian chief ? " " Yes , it is true . You have frequently complained , Father , that I am too severe with my men , and now , I presume , you want to find fault with my being too lenient with them . I 'll admit it was probably a lighter sentence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not premeditated . " Father Serra , interrupting : " And that is your idea of justice ? " " You must remember that the Indian fired first at Melos and aimed to kill him . " " Yes , that is true , but do n't you think that , under the circumstances , the Indian was justified ? " " I can not argue that point with you , as our views are radically " different , and the case is closed . To change the subject , I was told , Father Serra , that you had also received some letters from Mexico City . It is about one of mine that I came to see you . I presume you have also learned that the king has appointed a new viceroy in place of the Marquis de Croix ? " " Yes  --  Don Frey Antonio Maria Bucareli . " " Then you probably have also been informed that he means to abandon the port of San Blas and send our supplies overland ? " " Yes , but he will soon find that to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandonmentof our missions , and the nullification of our work in California . " While all that Serra said might be true , it did notP247mean anything to Captain Fages , since he was not personallyinterested in the missions or the work of the missionaries . Shrugging his shoulders , he said , indifferently , " You may be right , Father Serra . Sorry , but I must be going . I bid you good-day , gentlemen . " Father Crespi , who had been an interested spectator during the conversation between Serra and Fages , marveled at his friend 's patience while speaking of the trial of Pedro Melos with Fages . Troubles seemed to be coming thick and fast to the missionaries , and they were not of their own seeking . After an interval of brooding silence Father Crespi asked , " How can we expect to win converts to our faith if such an outrageous treatment is to be so flagrantly condoned ? " " We can not , Brother Crespi . It would be asking too much , " Serra replied , as he kept on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fages 's indifference . " God knows I do not want to think ill of anyone , but when men in high places make a travesty of justice , it is our bounden duty , if we would follow in the footstepsof our Lord , to protest against such inhuman acts . It is the least we can do for these poor unfortunate ones who look to us to protect them . Like you , my dear friend , I realize this state of affairs can not go on . Something must be done ! " " You are right , dear Father , and you are the man to do it . You know that from time to time , in many of your letters from the various missions , the fathers have suggested that one of our fraternity ought to be sent toP248Mexico City to straighten out some of our troubles , and now , with a new viceroy who is unfamiliar with our work , we will be worse off than ever before . " " I have also thought of that , Brother Crespi , and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ port of San Blas , I do not see how we can continue our work here . " " It would be impossible . But I believe if this matter were properly explained to the viceroy , he would change his mind about abandoning the harbor of San Blas . " " I think you are right , but who is there we can send to explain our situation to His Excellency ? " " You ! Father Serra , are the logical man , " was Crespi'sprompt reply . " I know it will be a great hardship , with your sore leg , to make that long and tiresome journey ; that is really the only thing I regret about it ; but I know of no one in our beloved fraternity who is better fitted for the task . You know that Father Palou has more than once mentioned in his letters to you how much could be accomplished if it were possible to have you go to Mexico City . And in his last communication to me , Father Lasuen said the same thing . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father President of the Alta California missions , would be received with proper consideration , and your requests would more than likely be granted . " " I had never thought of that . " " No , we knew you would n't . But we have  --  and we are all of one mind , dear friend . You are the one man , p 249Father Serra , who would be given a hearing by our new viceroy , and we feel confident that he will not only listen to you , but will , undoubtedly , agree to furnish us with necessary supplies of food and funds for the buildingof additional missions , which are so sorely needed . " " You may be right . I can see , now , that it is my duty to go and I shall prepare to leave on the San Carlos ; but before leaving , I must send word to all the fathers and arrange to have Father Palou act as Father Presidentduring my absence . This I know will meet with your approval , dear friend . " Camila @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Crespi stopped in to inquire how their patient , the Indian widow , was getting on . The fathers were not altogether surprised to see what Camila and Marta were doing , as they had learned from Ignacio for whom the garments they were making were intended . Serra , however , asked Camila to let the widow know that Dr. Prat would see to it that she receiveproper care and attention at the mission . As Camila had heard about the disquieting news that had come in letters from the City of Mexico on the San Carlos , she inquired of Father Serra , " Is it true that you are going to.leave for Mexico City ? " " Yes , that is my intention , and I expect to sail on the San Carlos when she leaves , which will probably be in a few days . "  | " Then I have a favor to ask of you . " " Anything serious ? " " Yes , and no . But , if you do n't object , I would like to leave here with Marta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gabriel mission . " " Have you any particular reason for wanting to make the change ? " " There are several reasons , but I would prefer not to mention them . You know of my betrothal to Juan , and what our plans are . But as we can not marry just yet , I want to take up some useful work and be able to see Juan , if possible , from time to time . " " Then Jose still refuses to give his consent ? " " I have n't asked him , Father , as I know he would refuse it , being anxious to have me marry someone else . " " I understand , and I can see no reason why you cannot go to the San Gabriel mission . " " I do not want you to think that I am finding fault with Jose . I know the day will come when he will think better of Juan and be only too glad to sanction our marriage . But until then , I would like , with your permission , to teach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cook and sew  --  and to read , write and speak Spanish . " " Your brother may object to your doing this . " " No , I do n't think he will , but as he is now , or soon will be , at San Gabriel , I 'll talk the matter over with him there . "  | " In the meantime , I shall write a letter that you are to deliver to Father Cruzado , in which I shall outline your plans to him . I know he will be pleased to have you undertake this work , and he will see to it that you are provided with necessary accommodations . " " Thank you , Father Serra. " wP252Serra Approves Topanque'sRequestAt San Diego , letters arrived from Serra and Crespi for Jaime , Fuster , Amurrio , CorporalRocha and Martin Reyes . In his letter to Jaime , Serra notified him of his early departure for Mexico , and what caused him to decide on going . As both Jaime and Fuster had advocated sending one of the fathers to the Capital @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ government and the missions , they were greatly pleased to learn that their dear Father President , himself , was going to Mexico to talk over the situation with the newly appointed viceroy . Jaime 's request that Amurrio be permitted to visit Topanque 's rancheria was also approved by Serra , to . whom Serra had also written personally , wishing him success in his efforts to win additional converts . When Martin Reyes learned that Serra approved of Father Amurrio 's going to Chief Topanque 's rancheria , in company with Fernando , Machado and himself , he lost no time in making necessary preparations for their departure . As their stay was to be indefinite , they provided themselves with ample sup- p 253plies , for which three pack animals were required . These were to be cared for by the muleteer , Juan AntonioCoronel , and a young neophyte ; the latter was also to act as a servant and assistant to Father Amurrio , whenever called upon . Horses were supplied for all the members of the party , with one extra mount for use in case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go fully armed , and to carry an extra supply of ammunition . Fernando also was supplied with a musket , which he had learned to use with deadly effect . Although quite a young lad , he was considered a first-class marksman . Inasmuch as there were no roads , and very few trails , Reyes did not neglect to include in his outfit an ax , two picks , two shovels and a heavy sledge hammer , as these implements might prove helpful in clearing off heavy brush , cutting down trees , breaking up boulders , and even building roads . They estimated that it would take them from five to seven days to reach their destination . There was no need to hurry , and they intended to explore as much of the back country as possible . They were delayed a few days waiting for the return of Corporal Rocha from San Gabriel . Although the communication from Commander Fages , which Juan had permitted Reyes to open in case it should be received during his absence , fully approved of Martin Reyes and Manuel Machado accompanying Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out until the corporal was on hand to take over the supervision of the mission guard and personally approveall that had been done . After having made the long overland journey from Loreto to San Diego , this back country excursion was much like child 's play to such experienced travelers as Reyes and Machado and everything went on smoothly for the first four days . They made good time , frequentlyrested their animals , stopped for their noondaymeal and customary siesta , and found good campingsites . As Martin Reyes had brought along his guitar , their evenings were spent with music and song . Father Amurrio also furnished interesting and improvingentertainment in telling some of his experiencesas a young man , and why he decided to study for the priesthood , and then finally prepared himself for missionary work among the savages . Machado , a Catalonian from the Pyrenees Mountains , was also prevailed upon to relate some of his experiences , and the tales he told of his native country brought both tears and laughter . With a limited and friendly audience , and no women around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the simple telling of his boyhood hardships , his long years of army life , and the many battles in which he had fought and been frequentlywounded , he unconsciously proved himself to be of heroic dimensions and a man who had earned and deserved a hundred medals for bravery and distinguishedservice , none of which he had ever received . Towards evening of the fifth day , while Martin Reyes was riding somewhat in advance of the otherp255members of his party , he was halted by a strange sight . At a distance , but advancing toward him , he saw a band of savages and in their midst a number of women , children and old men . Reyes did not know just what to make of it  --  whether the savages were membersof a migrating tribe , or some of Topanque 's followers , coming part of the way to meet them . No sooner had some of the women and children caught sight of Fernando , than they cried out : " Save us , friends , save us ! Help ! Help ! " Fernando , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own tribe , dashed towards them , and as he did so , he yelled : " Martin ! Martin ! come quick ! These Indians have captured some of my people . " Reyes and Machado , whipping up their steeds , soon caught up with Fernando ; then halting their horses , they aimed  --  fired their muskets , and seriously wounded three of the marauders . So thoroughly did they frighten the rest of them that they scampered in all directions , leaving their prisoners happy and unharmed . Fernando was quickly informed of what had happened : the women and children , guarded by some of the old men of their tribe , had been sent out to gather reeds and grasses for their basket work , when they found themselves surrounded by members of a powerful and unfriendly horde of savages that lived many miles from Topanque 's camp . The timely arrival of Reyes , Machado and Fernando probably saved their lives , or saved them from a fate even worse than death.  | Father Amurrio examined the three wounded savages ; and after having @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of their distant rancheria . Martin Reyes then had a talk with the releasedprisoners assuring them that there was not likely to be any further trouble . He then ordered everyone to fall in line ; and , with Fernando leading off , they were soon on their way to Topanque 's rancheria . After an hour 's march , Reyes called a halt . It was then decided that one of the old men of the tribe , who knew every tree and every trail from the sea to Topanque 's , should take Fernando 's place at the head of the line , and that Fernando was to ride on ahead as fast as he could , to his father 's rancheria and let him know what had happened . " You can tell your father , " said Reyes , " that he need not feel uneasy about us . It is our intention to keep on moving for another hour or two , and then camp for the night . We will have a supper of corn meal mush and spitted cotton-tails . Sentries will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack , and at daybreak we shall be on our way . " " That is fine , Senor Reyes , and I know my father will be grateful to you , as I am , for the kindness and care you are showing my people . " With a rather sheepishlook Fernando asked , " Have you ank other mes-sage ? " " Yes , you good-for-nothing kid , you tell your sister that I said she should box your ears , and that if all goes well I hope to see her tomorrow night . " p 257 " All right , I say , my friend , he tell me , my sister , she is a scamp so soon she box her ears tomorrow night . " " No ! No ! you got it all wrong , Fernando . " " I mix up , Senor Reyes , so may be , Natooka , she understand . Adios . " There is nothing the Indian enjoys quite so much as a fiesta . This word has many meanings in Spanish , but its general meaning to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all its dictionary definitions . Such holidays can not come too often for him . It also means a time for rejoicing , and Topanque , in order to honor his guests and the return of his first-born son , Fernando , as well as the safe return of the rescued prisoners , announced a three days ' holiday , and sent out invitations to his friends to come and join with them on this gala occasion . They came from near and far , in goodly numbers ; it mattered not how many , just so they came care-free and ready to take part in the games , dances , wrestling matches and the singing . There was an abundance of food , but none of the guests came emptyhanded , and all expected to have a good time . The dances of the early California Indians differed greatly from those of other Indians in various parts of the United States . When seen at night , in the enchantinglight of the moon or a blazing campfire , the effect was startling and bizarre . These dances were only indulged in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circle , sometimes chanting to the stamping steps and grunts of the males.  | Father Jacob Baegert , who had been in charge of one of the Lower California missions , left the followingdescription of their ancient dances : " Their dances consist in a foolish , irregular gesticulating and jumping , or advancing , and walking in a circle . Yet they take such delight in these amusements that they spend whole nights in their performance . These pastimes , though innocent in themselves , had to be rigidly interdicted , because the grossest disorders and vices were openly perpetrated by the natives during the performances ; but it is hardly possible to prevent them from indulging in their sports . " The younger element cared less for dancing , but it seemed to be fond of wrestling and a simple and almost childlike gambling game that consisted in guessing in which hand a stick of wood or shell was held . On the last night of the fiesta , Martin Reyes , who loved all kinds of manly sports , easily defeated Cuyamac , the strongest and most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an unsuccessful suitor for the hand of Natooka . Cuyamac , greatly chagrined at his defeat and jealous of the favor shown Reyes by Natooka and many others as well , was overheardmaking threats against the life of Reyes . There was still another element that cared not at all for the tribal games or dances , but preferred a far more interesting pastime  --  a " game " known the world over . And it was Cojuati , sister of Topanque , who was trying to instruct Manuel Machado in the rudiments of the ancient " game , " hoping thereby to overcome hisp259bashfulness . It was to prove a difficult task , but her ardent nature and her sincere belief that success would crown her efforts , made the work an enjoyable pastime . Love-making is an art  --  and Cojuati was a past-mistress of all its intricacies , and , unknown to Machado , she was gradually weaving about him a net that finally enmeshed the gallant soldier , and held him captive to her charms . Martin Reyes had been in such great demand since his arrival @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seen much of Natooka ; but now that he had completed the lengthy program that had been prepared for him , which had included playing the guitar , singing duets with Fernando , some Spanish love songs , dancing the fandango , bolero and other old-fashioned Spanish dances , and , as a finale , the wrestling match with Cuyamac , he joined Natooka , the senorita of his dreams . Together they walked off into the night . Father Amurrio , the guest of honor at Topanque 's rancheria , was looked upon as a superman by the savages . Although he had so far acquired only a smatteringof the dialect used by Topanque 's tribe , he made good use of it in telling them about some of the fiestas he had enjoyed as a boy in Spain . Then gradually he began to interest them in more serious stories , and at the end of the third day 's entertainment , and long past the customary bedtime hour , he asked Fernando to act as his interpreter while he told them of a wonderfulfiesta recounted in the Bible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how one of Christ 's disciples had betrayed Him with a kiss , and how his name had been handed down , from generation to generation , as the man who sold his soul for thirty pieces of silver . The story made a deep impression upon the Indians . At the close , as a tribute to Topanque and his people , Father Amurrio asked Fernando to recite the Lord 's prayer in his native tongue.  |p261Serra  in Mexico FATHER SERRA , accompanied by a fifteen-yearoldIndian boy , named Juan Evangelista , one of the first of the Monterey converts , . had safely reached San Blas , a port on the western coast of Mexico . The day following his arrival there , he left for Tepic , a small inland town , some distance from San Blas , where the Franciscans maintained a convent , known as the Hospice de Santa Cruz , where Serra intended to rest a few days before leaving on his long overland journey to the Capital . Besides the two burros which Father Serra and Juan Evangelista were riding , they had two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which they were slowly traveling frequently dipped into beautiful valleys , and rose up over rugged and picturesque mountains that awed the young Indian lad who had never beheld such a wondrous sight before . Several days after leaving Tepic , Father Serra complained of having a severe headache , and as it grew worse , he decided , after having reached a suitable camp-site , to rest awhile . Evangelista helped him to dismount , and quickly arranged blankets and pillows to make the father comfortable . It was quite a new experience for the young Indian to have a sick man to care for . As he looked at Father Serra , he noticed that he was breathingvery heavily and his half-opened eyes seemed wholly unconscious of his surroundings . This began to worry Evangelista and he did n't know what to do . Looking about him , he saw a small adobe cabin some distance away , and , after waiting a while longer , hoping that Father Serra might wake up , he decided to walk over to the cabin , and , if there was anyone living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the cabin , he met a young Mexican halfbreed , named Andreas Moreno , who was living there with his wife and their baby . As well as he ' could in broken Spanish , Evangelista told Senor Moreno what had happened , and between them they arranged to move Father Serra to the Mexican 's cabin , while the wife quickly freshened up her homely bed for Father Serra 's use . The burros and mules were staked out nearby , where there was ample pasturage . No sooner were all these arrangements made than young Evangelista collapsed and had to be placed on a couch of pine boughs in the same room with Serra . After both of Moreno 's patients were made comfortable , the Mexican and his wife hurriedly fixed up their lean-to of brushwood , for their own use ; and towards evening , Senora Moreno prepared a simple meal of atole ( cornmeal gruel ) and broiled kid that had been slaughtered the previous day . They hoped this rarebit might tempt the appetites of their distinguishedguests after they had recovered from theirp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following day that Father Serra awoke from his trancelikesleep . After looking about for awhile , Father Serra was greatly surprised to find himself a guest in the little adobe cabin . The Mexican , seeing that the father was awake , explained to him what had happened . It was all a mystery to Father Serra . Finally he decided to get up , but found he was too weak , nor did he feel the want of food ; however , at Moreno 's earnest solicitation , he drank a cup of creamy goat 's milk . What worried the father most was the illness of Evangelista . Calling him two or three times , brought no response , so he asked  --  the Mexican to bathe the boy 's face and hands with cold water . This treatment was fairly successful , and shortly afterward Evangelista regained consciousness , and , at Serra 's request , he drank a cup of milk , but refused the food . He wanted to get up , but Father Serra insisted that he keep off his feet for the rest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were able to get up and partake of some cornmeal gruel and goat 's milk . This greatly pleased Moreno and his wife , who looked upon the coming of Father Serra as a great blessing , and therefore were anxious and willing to serve him to the best of their ability . While questioning his hosts , Serra learned that on account of the great distance to any place of worship , they had been unable to have their baby baptized ; so , as a partial return to these wayside Samaritans , he offered to perform this ceremony for them . Beamingp264with joy , the Mexicans made the necessary preparations for the event , and after talking the matter over , Moreno asked the father if he would have any objections to naming the boy after him . " Not at all , " said Serra . " I shall deem it an honor , and I sincerely trust the boy will grow up and be a joy and blessing to you . " After blessing the water to be used for the boy 's baptism , Serra named their first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duly accredited the boy 's godfather and with Father Serra 's consent , presentedthe lusty youngster with his own rosary . On the morning of the fourth day , as both Serra and Evangelista were feeling better , they decided to leave . After again thanking his hosts and bestowing his blessingupon these simple , kind-hearted and God-fearing people , Serra bade them farewell , and again resumed his long-delayed journey to the Capital . Unfortunately , a malignant fever forced both travelersto seek relief at the hospital in Guadalajara , where , for a time , neither the doctors nor the nurses believed that Father Serra or Juan Evangelista would recover . While the shadow of death was hovering over their sorely tried patients , these kind-hearted doctors and nurses did not know that the Father President of the California missions had not yet finished his work in the Lord 's vineyard  --  and not until that work was done would the gateway into the great beyond be opened to him , nor could they be opened to his youthful convert , until after the purpose of Serra 's long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ relief came to both travelers , and again they started towards their destination . Just before reaching Queretaro , which was about one hundred and twenty miles from Mexico City , Father Serra again had a slight relapse and was obliged to spend several days at a hospital in that city . Arriving at Mexico City  --  weak and weary from his serious illness and travel , Father Serra 's arrival at the San Fernando College , unexpected as it was , created a sensation . Some years had passed since their beloved brother last rested within its walls . The numerous and glowing reports of his successful work in the Californiashad made his name a household word throughout New Spain , and all the members of their fraternity from the Reverend Father Guardian to the sacristan of the college , were happy to welcome their zealous brother missionary . In an unostentatious way , they tried to show their love and esteem for their brother by trying to serve him . Serra 's simple wants , however , were soon supplied . And as he always preferred to serve , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could do for him . After resting a few days , Serra joined them in their daily tasks , and when their evening meal was over , they all gathered around him and he told them about the work that had been done in Alta California . He told them about the planning of the four expeditions and their final arrival at San Diego , of the many who lost their lives fighting the dreaded scurvy  --  of the marchp266to Monterey and Captain Portola 's return to San Diego because of their failure to locate that famous port  --  of the danger of starvation , and the contemplatedabandonment of the San Diego mission  --  also of the nine days of prayer and the miraculous coming of the San Antonio . Then he told them of the second march to Monterey ; the founding of the five missions and the discovery of t'he great body of water which they named San Francisco Bay in honor of their seraphicfather St. Francis . Another night he told them of the California Indians ; of the many converts they had gained , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the new missions . To most of the fathers that were present , Serra 's story was a revelation , and all were deeply moved as he recounted their successes , their failures , and the hardships they had endured . Gradually his hearers began to realize the immensity of the great work their Order had undertaken in their efforts to Christianize these ignorant savages . Then Serra began to point out the many handicaps that had so often impeded and hampered them in their work , of the outrageous and unjust treatment of the savages  --  telling them , as a case in point , of the soldiers ' assault on a distant rancheria : how they had driven off the women , and how one of their number had captured the young wife of the Indian chief and carried her off , how the husband , justly incensed , tried to kill the guilty man and was shot down in attempting to avenge this dis/graceful outrage . This being one of the many evils they had had to contend with . " And then , as a climax to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ startled brothers , " came the word from our beloved Father Guardian that the newly appointed viceroy , His Excellency , Don Antonio Marie Bucareli , was going to abandon the port of San Blas , and send our needed supplies overland . " Resting for a moment , Serra continued , " And that , my dear brothers , would prove fatal , as the cost would be too great . Now you can all see that if we are to continueour glorious work in Alta California , something must be done . " It was at the earnest solicitation of the fathers now in charge of our missions in California , that I consented to undertake this arduous task , not for the pleasure there was in it , yet , thank God ; it has been a great joy and pleasure to be with you once more , to join you in your daily devotions , to advise with you , and to decide among us what is the best thing to do . If it is agreeable to you , let us take this matter up with our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a good and pious man  --  but before all , my beloved brothers , let us ask God 's aid and assistance in this meritorious work we have undertaken in California ; and to show by our efforts how deeply we appreciate the honor of being afforded the opportunity of bringing these simple souls to kneel at His feet in adoration of Almighty God . " The hour being late , all knelt as the Reverend Father Verger , the head of the college , repeated their nightly prayers . P268Indian Unrest AMONG the Indians living in the vicinity of San Diego , there was developing a well defined undercurrent of animosity both against the white faces of the San Diego mission and those of the presidio . There was no apparent cause for it , and little thought or attention was given to the matter . Perhaps it owed its origin to the fight that had taken place between the mission soldiers and the Indians , on August 15 , 1769 , when three Indians had been killed and an unknown number wounded , but this had never been definitely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the soldier guards , named Francisco Pena , caught an Indian climbing over the palisade surrounding the women 's quarters . Chasinghim with a drawn sword , Pena followed him into the mission church where , forgetful of time and place , he gave the savage an extra jab , causing the blood to flow quite freely . Father Jaime , who happened to be at his morning devotions when this occurred , was aroused by the cry of the Indian and hurried to the scene . He was horrified at what he saw , and dumbfoundedat the desecration of the sanctity of the holy church . His anger aroused , Jaime threatened to excommunicatethe soldier as he came between him and thep269wounded Indian , both of whom fell at the father 's feet , the savage crying in fear to be saved  --  Pena begging the father to forgive him . A crowd quickly gathered about them . Without asking any questions , Jaime ordered two neophytes to drag Pena out of the building , while he himself cared for the Indian 's wounds , after which he had him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time he did not know what to do . With the fear of excommunication hanging over his head , he was certainly not in a happy mood . At first he thought he would ask Father . Fuster to intercede for him ; but , being doubtful of the outcome , he quickly dismissed that from his mind . Finally , Pena decided he would go to the presidio and tell his good friend , Corporal Rocha , all about his troubles , and explain how , after numerous and unheededwarnings , he had again found the Indian climbingover the palisade to the women 's quarters , which had been strictly forbidden . As Pena had been placed there to guard against this very thing , he believed he was justified in punishing the Indian ; and , being furtherincensed against the unfaithful neophyte for his cursing and villifying Fathers Serra , Jaime , Fuster and the white faces generally , he admitted that he may have carried the thing too far , and in his choler , failing to notice that both had entered the church , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in so doing aroused the ire of the good Father Jaime . " It was only after the Indian cried out for help , "   said Pena , " that I noticed where we were , and kneeling at the father 's feet I begged his forgiveness . Instead of being forgiven , Father Jaime said he would excommunicateme , and had me , a soldier of King Carlos of Spain , and a faithful member of the church , ignominiouslydragged from the building by two neophytes . It would break my dear mother 's heart if she knew of my sad predicament . You know , Corporal , that I did not mean to do anything wrong , but the good Father Jaime , whom I have always greatly respected and admired , is spoiling those Indians . They are getting so insolent and overbearing that it is becoming more and more difficult to make them obey our rules and regulations . Those slovenly sneaks can make Father Jaime believe they are sprouting angels ' wings ; but I know better . Even now , I have reason to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Juan had given close attention to Pena 's report , and asked , " What reasons have you for believing the Indiansare planning some mischief ? " " My suspicions were first aroused by some of their queer actions and the curious and inquisitive questions they asked . One of the Indians wanted to know at how great a distance one of our soldiers could kill a man . Another one wanted to know how many musketswe had , and where we got the powder and shot we put in them ; while a third Indian 's curiosity was aroused as to what caused the noise when the guns were fired . These are but a few of the many questionsthey asked . I have also noticed that of late theyP271act quite different from the way they used to . It is true they are not all alike , and many of them are as kind and thoughtful as our own people . " Another unusual thing that aroused my suspicions were the meetings that have taken place between our neophytes and some of the Indians from the distant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted , they either ignored my questions , or started to tell me some lies . " I called Father Fuster 's attention to . what was going on , and asked him to warn Father Jaime not to visit any of the rancherias without taking a soldier guard with him . Yet he keeps on going alone , and pays no attention to our warnings . It is true , they all like Father Jaime , and he is gaining many converts ; btxt I know it is not safe for any white faces , as they call us , to go among those Indians unarmed . " " I am glad you told me. all this , Pena , and I think I shall start an investigation on my own account . I shall also intercede for you with Father Jaime , and I feel sure that he will forgive you for having desecrated the sanctity of the church , when he learns what caused you to forget yourself . As additional protection , I shall ask that another soldier be stationed at the mission . To make the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alternation of the guard personnel if it meets with the fathers ' approval . However , all this can wait until I return from San Gabriel , where Captain Rivera has also ordered some changes to be made . In the meantime , Pena , you had better return to the mission and keep close watch about why is going on among the mission neophytes . And be sure to report to me anything that you think may require prompt investigation . We must keep both our eyes and ears open and take no chances . " The following day Juan questioned a number of the soldiers at the presidio about Pena 's story , and was given ample corroborative information . On the strength of it he rode out to the mission , intending to caution the fathers . As he turned in at the barracks he met Father Fuster , who promptly insisted that Juan have supper with them . As usual , after they had wined and dined on frijoles ( the French kidney bean ) , boiled spinach and rabbit stew , Jaime suggested a game of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the subject of the fathers ' carelessness in traveling back and forth among the different rancherias unaccompaniedby a soldier guard . The corporal cautioned both the fathers not to wander too far afield , and have one of the guards go with them , as there was always some danger . Jaime pooh-poohed it all , and spoke of the Indians  --  how friendly they had grown , and of their many new converts . He knew all this would please Father Serra when he heard of it on his return from Mexico . " I sincerely hope , Father Jaime , that you are makingno mistake about there being no danger . We have heard many rumors of discontent among the savages , and we know they have had some trouble both at SanP273Carlos and San Gabriel , that is why I think we should not be too sanguine about conditions in this vicinity . " I do n't suppose Pena told you , Father Jaime , how some of the Indians , even from distant rancherias , are trying to get all the information they can about how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shot and powder . Nor did he tell you about one of our Christian Indians , who climbed over the palisade to the women 's quarters , despite frequent warnings that if caught doing it again he would forfeit his life. - This , however , did not deter him , but what aroused Pena 's ire , was thZ. neophyte 's villification of both you and Father Fuster . It was this foul-mouthed abuse that caused Pena to punish him , which brought him such a severe reprimand . " Of course , we all know that Pena should not have followed the Indian into the church ; but the poor boy , in his anger  --  and it was justifiable  --  had forgotten even the laws of sanctuary . I sincerely hope , Father Jaime , that you will forgive Pena even this grave offense , which weighs so heavily upon him . You know he is a fine soldier ; well educated , and a man of good character . That was why I , personally , selected him for one of your guards , knowing , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and will do his duty regardless of consequences . " " You are right , my son , " Jaime admitted ; " I feel that I have been too severe with him . " Turning to Fuster , " would you mind taking my place and finishing THE CONQUEST OF CALIFORNIAthis game with Juan , while I go and beg Pena 's forgivenessfor my rash temper which , I trust , God will help me to bring under subjection . " Father Jaime soon returned from the barracks and assured Juan that both he and Pena were feeling much happier , now that they had come to a better understanding . " But I cautioned him , " said Jaime , " to be more lenient with the Indians , to whom the ways of religion are still passing strange . " P275Cuyamac BanishedARTURO CUYAS , the distinguished lexicographer gives the following definitions for the word " Rancheria "  --  a settlement ; a cluster of huts ; hamlet ; camp ; etc . For the word , " Rancho "  --  a mess ; hut ; , hamlet ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Rancheria " in connection with the native savages , the Franciscans referred to a settlement or cluster of huts , and not , as many believed , to a small ranch or farm ; for the savages of Alta California had no farms and knew nothing about cultivating the soil , prior to the coming of California 's expeditions . At Topanque 's rancheria  --  Amurrio , Reyes , Machado , Coronel and Fernando utilized their spare time by teaching the Indians how to improve their lands and make them productive , how to make useful articles from reeds and grasses , besides baskets , how to fashionclay into pots , bowls , jugs , etc. , as well as adobe bricks for the building of huts more durable than those built of tules , broken branches and the like . These were but a few of the many things they taught them . Although none of Topanque 's Indians had been accustomed to manual labor , they soon became interested , and gradually a creative as well as imitativep276instinct was slowly developed . And instead of spending their time as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many hours to various kinds of labor ; and eventually they became useful , instead of useless , members of the human family . During the late afternoonsand evenings , Father Amurrio had a number of classes which he instructed in Spanish and simple arithmetic . This was done objectively and was greatly enjoyed by his pupils . As they advanced in their knowledge of the language , Amurrio began to instruct them in the rudiments of religion , thus preparing them for conversion . Although , if questioned , Martin Reyes would not have admitted it , the impelling reason for his wanting to go with Fernando and Amurrio to visit Topanque 's rancheria , was his keen desire to see more of Natooka for whom he had taken a great fancy , which had now ripened into love for the beautiful young Indian girl . After his day 's work was done , Reyes managed , somehow , to join Natooka . They would frequently take long walks , or on moonlight nights , they would , together with Fernando and his girl friend , or Machadoand Cojuati , cluster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ playing his guitar ; or , they would all join in singing some of the old Spanish ballads he had taught them . Eventually , the nightly meetings between Reyes and Natooka aroused Cuyamac 's jealousy . Although Cuyamacwas a suitor for Natooka 's hand , she treated himp277with scant courtesy , and he was beginning to doubt his ability to win her . Action was necessary . The tribal medicine man had agreed to help him , but failed . The best way would be to kill Reyes . Cuyamac , biding his time , when the opportunity came , broke up an interestingmeeting between the lovers , by firing an arrow at Reyes who , fortunately , was wearing his leather jacket which saved his life . Natooka , with a loud cry , drew out the arrow and ran to her father with it . The arrow was recognized as belonging to Cuyamac . Topanque called some of his followers and ordered them to find the would-be assassin , Cuyamac , and bring him in . A meeting of the tribal elders was promptly called to try the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Topanque explainedwhat had happened and they were dumbfoundedat Cuyamac 's action . The elders did not have long to wait . The ceremony was opened with a weird tribal chant as Cuyamac was brought before them . Topanque ordered Cuyamac to speak and tell the elders why he had so flagrantly disgraced his tribe by trying to kill their friend and guest . Cuyamac : " That I shot Reyes is true , and I am sorry I did not kill him . You all know Cuyamac wanted Natooka for his woman . Since these white faces came , she no longer looks at me . I did not like to have her go with Reyes , so I had a talk with our medicine man and he told me , he would fix it , so that Reyes would not get Natooka . He lied to me , so I decided to kill Reyes . "   An elder : " There was yet another way to get Na-tooka . " Cuyarnac : ( proudly ) " You all know I am strong . Yet this white face , thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like all white faces , he has a charmed life , else why did n't Cuyamac 's poisoned arrow kill him ? " Among Topanque 's braves what one dares me to fight ? What two can throw me down ? Yet here comes a new man , who is still a boy , and puts me to shame before all our warriors . Then I swore to kill him . Cuyamac has had his way , and Cuyamac is not afraid to die . " The elders ( after conferring ) : " It is well , Cuyamacdies at sunrise . " Reyes , Machado and Amurrio had silently witnessedthis thrilling scene . Then Reyes , holding up his right hand to attract the attention of the elders : " May I speak. ? " The elders : " Speak . " Reyes , coming forward : " I have a favor to ask . Althoughit is true that Cuyamac tried to kill me , I forgivehim and I should like to have him go unpunished . " Contrary murmurs were heard at this request . Reyes , again holding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father Amurrio to speak ? " The elders : " Yes ! Yes ! Let him speak . " Then Amurrio , facing the elders : " Senores , when Chief Topanque sent word to his son , Fernando , who had long been living among us , and whom we have learned to love , that he wanted him to return to hisp 279home , and you so kindly asked me to accompany him , I was greatly pleased . I came as a friend , and I want you all to be my friends . I came to you with a message from one who died many years ago in order that we might be saved . It was to tell you about Him that I came here . While He lived He taught men to forgive those who fought against them . " But even before His time , there was another great teacher to whom God entrusted His Ten Commandments , ' which He ordered His children to obey , and one of those commandments says : ' Thou Shalt Not Kill . ' Senor Reyes knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Among us , we , too , have elders who sit in judgment against those who break these commandments , and our elders have often said that ignorance of the law will excuse no one ; but it was because of Christ 's appeal for the sinner , to forgive those who trespass against us , that Senor Reyes forgaveCuyamac , and it is in the name of our Lord God , that I also ask you , my friends , to forgive Cuyamac , and let him go . " Again there were murmurs , but the elders promptly demanded silence . Fernando was the next to hold up his hand . He asked the elders : " May Fernando , the son of Topanque , speak ? " All : " Aye ! Aye ! Let Fernando speak . " Fernando : " Dear friends , you have heard Senor Reyes , the man who saved my life , speak , and you have heard our friend , Father Amurrio , speak ; and if the great Father Serra were here , he , too , would beg you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does not speak of revenge , but of salvation and an eternal life , which we may all gain if we obey God 's laws , and I know it would please him and our friends here , if you would let Cuyamac go free . " Topanque then stepped forward and said : " Your chief never says much . However , our elders found Cuyamac guilty , and our tribal laws make death the penalty . The white faces , who are our friends , say let Cuyamac live . Our elders do not like this , but Father Amurrio says we should let him go . Senor Reyes , and my son , Fernando , who will some day be your chief , and who now speaks for the great white chief , Father Serra , also want you to let Cuyamac go . So we have agreed not to kill Cuyamac , but he must go , because he tried to kill Senor Reyes , who is our friend , and who saved the life of Fernando . Topanquehas made his talk . " Topanque , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pointing off commandingly : " Cuyamac , you are no longer one of Topanque 's braves . Go  --  the way is open . " As Cuyamac , carrying himself proudly , left the meeting place and camp , with his head he motioned to two of his friends , Holgu and Rezic , to follow him . Beyond the confines of Topanque 's rancheria they came to a halt , when Cuyarnac told his friends that he intended to kidnap Natooka , and asked them to help him . He also told them that a great uprising of some ofP281the Indian tribes was being planned for the purpose of killing the white faces , robbing them , and destroying the San Diego mission and presidio . Word had been sent far and wide to those tribes who were opposed to the coming of these bearded men  --  ordering them to get ready . Cuyamac assured Holgu and Rezic it would be great sport , then added , " When the day of the attackis agreed upon I want you to go with me . There will be much to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As Holgu and Rezic had long been friends of Cuyamac 's , whom they respected for his strength and cunning , and believed  --  from the Indian 's point of view  --  that he was justified in attempting to kill Natooka 's white-faced lover , they agreed to help him . Cuyamac quickly unfolded his scheme to his confederates , and while he planned to carry off Natooka himself , his friends were to steal the horses , let the mules out of the corral , and wait for him at the water hole about a mile north of the camp . It was long after the midnight hour when Cuyamac gave them the word , nor was there any hitch in their pre-arranged plans , and everything was carried out so quietly that none of Topanque 's followers learned of Natooka 's abduction until the following morning . The same evening that Cuyamac hatched his diabolicalscheme to kidnap Natooka , the old gray-haired soldier , Manuel Machado , had a serious repair job on his hands  --  one that greatly worried him . His awk-P282ward hands were dexterous enough in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to threading a needle , and sewing on a patch , or darning holes in his socks , he was at a disadvantage . However , " Army Regulations " required neatness and cleanliness ; and how could a soldier be neat and clean with torn trousers or torn unmentionables ? That was what worried him , and before sunrise he must finish repairing a rent in his army trousers . How it happened he could n't tell , but he knew it happened that evening , and all the ripping cuss words in a soldier 's vocabulary would not close the rip , so with infinite bravery and many deep sighs , poor Machado started to close the gap . As Machado was busily engaged in his sartorial job , Cojuati entered his tent , bringing with her a beautiful basket of her own weaving , which she presented to her gray-haired hero . The entrance of Cojuati rather startledMachado , and he blushed for shame at being caught doing a woman 's work . He thanked Cojuati for the fine basket she had brought him , and asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his awkward mending . Cojuati for a time watched how clumsily Machado worked , then took the trousers out of his hands and said : " Me fix ' em up fine . You no can do . " Machado , after watching how cleverly she did the work , was willing to admit the allegation  --  " You no can do . " After the mending was finished , Cojuati straightened up things in the tent and was about top 283leave when Machado handed her a silver peso . She was so happy to receive the present that she impulsivelyembraced the donor , and , with a deep sigh of contentment she comfortably rested her head on Machado'sshoulder . The bashful soldier was so taken aback that he did not know what to do , when Cojuati , trying to help him out of his dilemma , did another repair job by placing Machado 's arm about her waist , and added the significant words : " We do like Senor Reyes and Natooka . " As the muleteer , Juan Antonio Coronel , who accompanied Reyes and Machado on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his early morning visit to the corral , which had been fenced in for the safe-keepingof their horses and mules , he found the bars down  --  all the animals gone , and the young Indian , whom Topanque had placed in charge of the inclosure , se  --  curely bound , gagged , badly battered , and unconscious . When finally aroused the young man was so dazed that he could n't tell what had happened , but spoke in a disconnected manner of some huge monster who had hit him with a big club . Hurriedly making his way to Reyes 's tent , Coronel told him what had occurred , and at the same time aroused the whole camp . It was then discovered that Natooka was missing . Topanque quickly assembled his followers , and , as they were being checked up found that Holgu and Rezic were also missing . He was then told of their having been seen with Cuyamac shortly after he was banished . It did not take Topanquelong to figure out what had taken place , and he promptly planned to start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trio . had carried off Natooka and driven off the animals so as to delay pursuit . Selecting twenty of his youngest and ablest warriors , Topanque then prepared to pursue the abductors . He was joined by Reyes , Machado and Coronel , and after considerable persuasion , Fernando was also allowed to go along . All were fully armed . The first thing they had to do was to find the trail of the miscreants . They were puzzled for a time , as there were hoof prints in all directions . However , when Reyes explained to them that it was more than likely that Cuyamac would make use of the horses and drive off the mules purposely to puzzle them , he also assured them that if they followed the hoof prints of the horses they-would undoubtedly be able to locate Cuyamac , rescue Natooka , and punish her abductors . Although Topanque accepted Reyes 's dictum , he nevertheless ordered two of his warriors to follow the trail of the mules , and thus avoid making any mistake . Although Cuyamac and his friends had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly . As they were not familiar with the handling of horses it proved a handicap to their progress . They had tied Natooka on the back of a horse , which was led by Rezic  --  another cause for delay . While there werep285numerous well-worn trails , some of them were so narrowand steep that the riders were frequently compelled to dismount and walk or ride along in single file . Cuyamac was headed for a steep and almost inaccessiblemountain where he had lately discovered a deep cavern with a long tunnel leading to a second opening . There he and his party intended to hide until the felt they were safe from pursuit . While Natooka , who had been gagged to keep her from crying out , made the best of a precarious situation , she was not altogether helpless . She knew that , sooner or later , both her father and Martin Reyes would learn what had happened to her and hasten to her rescue . The thought uppermost in her mind was  --  what could she do to help them ? By the time her captorscame @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a shell necklace that Reyes had given her , hoping that he , or one of the Indians , would find it . It was not long before a prized bracelet was sacrificed . Then she pulled out some of her hair and dropped it , and she even succeeded in tearing a piece out of her cotton wrapper which she had made from some material Reyes had given her . Natooka believed that any one of these things would serve to point the way and let her people know that she was being carried off . She knew that help would have to come quickly , or it would be too late . While Topanque , Reyes and some of the Indians were following a freshly broken trail over which it appeared horses had lately passed , one of the
