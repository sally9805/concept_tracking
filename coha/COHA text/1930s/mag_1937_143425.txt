Every year at the end of November muskrats set out to do something about their annual housing shortage . In the summer they burrow into the banks of streams or ponds but during the northern winter the underwater entrances freeze up and the muskrats must build houses . A muskrat house is a haphazard domelike heap of reeds and marsh grass . Muskrats are vegetarians , so if necessary in the dead of winter they can eat their houses . Mostly each family lives alone , which makes muskrat census-taking easy . Walter Abner Gibbs , who is the biggest muskrat breeder in the eastern U. S. , used to wade round his 700 acres of Maryland marshland in hip boots , counting muskrat houses to see how large his next year 's catch would be . But last week impatient Walter Gibbs decided to take this year 's muskrat census by airplane , an innovation . He counted 4,000 muskrat huts , estimated they had 20,000 tenants . <P> When Walter Gibbs bought his land in 1913 he thought he was just going to use it for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay his taxes in muskrat pelts . Mr. Gibbs was pleased to find he could . He invented two traps : one which got the muskrats not only by the leg ( which they often gnaw off to escape ) but also by the body ; another which netted them , captured them alive . Before long he was inventing and manufacturing traps to catch everything from English sparrows to bears . By 1919 he had a large factory in Trainer , Pa. , made as many as 2,000,000 traps a year , grossed annually as much as $400,000 . But the fur business in all its branches was hit hard by Depression . Last year he sold out to his only big competitor , Animal Trap Co. of Lititz , Pa. , which began as an enterprise of the celebrated Oneida Community . <P> Two to three million brown muskrats are caught annually by fur companies like Orange Cameron Land Co. in the Louisiana bayous , the great U. S. muskrat country . Their pelts retail at from 50 to $1.25 . , But prime muskrat is black muskrat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and whose pelts bring $2 . With the money he got for his trap factory Mr. Gibbs promptly bought 3,000 acres of muskrat marsh on Currituck Sound , N. C. , began transferring his black muskrats south . More than half the 2,400 muskrats he caught alive in Maryland last year he shipped off to breed in North Carolina . Since then he has been busy dredging canals and ditches so his muskrats can swim deep in winter and grub for roots underneath the ice , using the mud to build up the banks so there will be plenty of slick slopes for them to slide down in their leisure hours . Next week Mr. Gibbs will fly down to North Carolina to see how his muskrats are doing . Though he does not plan to do any trapping there till 1939 , in five years he expects to be catching 25,000 a season . <P> Since Mr. Gibbs went into the muskrat business he has caught about 75,000 animals , which would mean more than 1,000 muskrat coats if he had sold them all for fur . Actually he sells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Czechoslovakia . A pair of black muskrats used to bring him $50 , twice as much as he gets now . Almost all the skinned muskrats are sold to markets in Baltimore and Philadelphia . Sometimes the meat is retailed as " marsh rabbit , " sometimes as terrapin.
