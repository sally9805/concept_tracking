In his transcontinental tour last autumn , Franklin Roosevelt let the voters of several States see how much he resented their Senators ' fight against his plan to enlarge the Supreme Court . Last week , on tour again , the President let the voters of another section of the country see how he felt about their representatives ' action on part of his current legislative program . Starting on his spring vacation , the President paused at Gainesville , Ga . to dedicate a public square named after him . Introduced to the crowd of 20,000 by Georgia 's Senator Walter F. George , who like most other Southern Congressmen , last summer went on record against the Wages &; Hours Bill , the President ignored Mr. George in his speech , pointedly patted the back of loyal Governor Eurith D. Rivers and then proceeded to give his favorite theme-that Recovery is being held up by " minority selfishness " -a new twist : <P> " They selfish minorities have the same type of mind as those representatives of the people who vote against legislation to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the objectives but do not like the methods , and then fail utterly to offer a better method of their own . <P> " Georgia and the lower South may just as well face facts-simple facts presented in the lower South by the President of the United States . Your Governor understands these facts . The purchasing power of the millions of Americans in this whole area is far too low . Most men and women who work for wages in this whole area get wages which are far too low . On the present scale of wages , and therefore on the present scale of buying power , the South can not and will not succeed in establishing successful new industries . " Not since Madam Secretary Perkins twitted Dixie on its shoelessness have Southerners taken from Washington such a jolt as came next . The President ascribed part of the South 's economic difficulties to old-fashioned feudalism , added that : " When you come down to it , there is little difference between the feudal system and the fascist system . If you believe in the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President 's curt speech by a tobacco-chewing crowd which had expected a few congratulatory truisms was one of silent , hurt amazement . Next day , it was echoed by the Southern press , by which time the President was in a fairly snappish mood himself .
