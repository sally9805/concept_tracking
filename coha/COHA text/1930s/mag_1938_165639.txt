Solemnest of man 's buildings , the mausoleum gets its name from the great tomb of King Mausolus at Halicarnassus ( c. 353 B.C. ) . The favorite mausoleum of a generation ago resembled a Greek shrine ; today 's favorite more appropriately resembles a Frigidaire . But last week near Wilmington , Del. , a family noted for its independence was about ready to move the remains of the late Alfred Irne du Pont into a tomb of quite original design and princely size . One of the largest concrete and granite towers in the world , 210 feet high , with an eventual capacity of six Du Ponts , it was planned by A. I. 's architect son , Alfred Victor du Pont . <P> This family memorial will not be isolated . When saturnine old A. I. du Pont died in 1935 he left a trust fund of $4,000,000 , $1,000,000 in cash and " Nemours , " his 1,600-acre Wilmington estate , to establish a foundation for Delaware 's crippled children and aged poor . For this foundation , the $300,000 mausoleum will be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as soon as workmen finish waterproofing the vaults , Jessie Ball du Pont , A. I. 's widow , may have a section of Nemours ' high wall knocked down to allow public inspection of the tomb . <P> The Du Pont tower is probably the first private mausoleum in history with a six-passenger elevator , beacon lights and a carillon . Four concrete eagles stare from the tower 's four corners , the Du Pont arms in concrete ornament the severe Renaissance faade . RECTITUDINE STO ( " By rectitude I stand " ) is the motto carved above it .
