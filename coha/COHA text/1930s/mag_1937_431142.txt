 | MACHINES are coming to agricultural Mississippi . After a morning tour of industrial Jackson I had to scrape from my shoe soles layers of cottonseed oil , pungent creosote , and clayey bentonite , all caked hard with dried mud from a petroleum well being dug by special appropriation of the State Legislature . Twice daily the red and silver streamline Rebel train flashes through the State ? past ox teams plodding along sunken roads , new myriad-windowed garment factories , negroes driving ramshackle buckboards ? and glides beneath airplanes that are heading into the capital 's spacious , four-way airport . The train hostess was holding a platform reception as we alighted at Jackson , greeting many passengers by name , thanking one woman for flowers she had sent her the week before , while another called , " I 'm going to bring you a jar of my peach preserves when I go back next week . " HOOP SKIRTS AND COVERED WAGONS Over in Natchez girls in lavender hoopskirt gowns trimmed with rare old lace sidled into Fords and Chevrolets to drive annual pilgrimage-week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Red the Rose . Up in the Delta a sprightly gentleman of 82 years called his chauffeur to take THE GEOGRAPHIC 'S photographer and me in his Packard to a log cabin still standing on the plantation of 6,000 acres of cotton , corn , pecans , and hay . He and his uncle built the cabin only 6S years ago , after they had cleared the land and floated the timbers in from the surrounding forest and the chimney brick from the river dock ten miles distant ( page 264 ) . This epic from covered wagon to limousine in one man 's lifetime is a clue to why Mississippians call their State " the last frontier . " THE GENESIS OF JACKSON Busy , modern Jackson illustrates the transformation . The city is no upstart ; it has been the State Capital since 1822 . Stately homes with Wistaria growing over columned porticoes and with crape myrtle on the lawns line wide avenues . Barber shops still are spacious forums of political argument where a southern colonel may doff his broad-brimmed hat in courtly salutation without toppling over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and homes knew not the builder who estimates costs in cubic feet . From sidewalks beneath rusty tin roofs you look across the street toward shop fronts with onyxlike tiles , burnished metal , and neon lights ( Plate VIII ) . One tall office building with cubistic floors and chromium elevator doors rises knife-edged to carve an otherwise gracious skyline just opposite a colonial-type home now painted green and occupied by the Salvation Army . Taking swift elevators to the 18th floor , the visitor may see how the city is laid out in mammoth squares which usually have only six or eight dwellings to a block ? houses set far apart in the parklike expanse of gardens , trees , and lawns . 264 THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE  | A lofty office building , which modified its design and added gargoyles to conform to an adjacent Gothic church , houses a modernistic cafe that faces the pillared Governor 's Mansion , serene in a mid-city lawn shaded by oaks and native cedars . Natural-gas wells click in pastures within sight of the State Capitol ; shafts on their campuses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ colleges ; several State Street residents have pooled their rock gardens to give space to a highly productive digging . Growing pains , these , of a pioneering city implanted upon a community which retains the gracious leisure of the Deep South . As recently as 1920 century-old Jackson still had only 22,817 people ; by 1930 it counted more than twice that number ; in 1937 a local census estimated nearly 60 , - 000 , a rate of growth rivaling that of Los Angeles . The citizens disclaim any boom . The increase , they assert with reason , is the normal result of several obvious causes . One impetus was the discovery only seven years ago of natural gas which now flows from nearly 100 wells in the city limits , much of it into pipe lines that radiate all over the State and reach even into Louisiana and Florida . Another change was putting through high-power transmission lines ? the State had none until 1925 ? and the consequent encouragement of factories in Jackson as well as in many other places . Most important factor , perhaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ever-wider wingspread as a shopping point , and controverts the old taunt that " Mississippi has three big cities : Mobile , New Orleans , and Memphis . " Early among Jackson 's industries , naturally enough , were cottonseed-oil mills . In the musty archives of the squat Old State Capitol are ante-bellum laws which  | prohibited gin owners from polluting streams with cottonseed or dumping it inside town and city limits . No need for enforcing such laws now , when for every 500-pound bale of cotton the planter may sell an average of 900 pounds of seed for about $18 . All around Jackson 's " hoop skirts , " as someone aptly called the outlying industrial belt , tall , circular warehouses with conical metal tops rise like the oasthouses of Kent 's hop-growing districts . Each seed house stores 5,000 tons or so of cottonseed which awaits the mechanical alchemy that will convert its parts into horse collars , salad dressing , blotting paper , cheese crackers , house roofing , and an amazing variety of other products . Should you be reading your GEOGRAPHIC @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Guy Lombardo 's orchestra , you will be indebted to the velvety cottonseed for ingredients in camera film and phonograph record . The seeds pour first into huge machines which whirl , shake , screen , and pull out all the dirt and foreign particles . The clean seed goes to delinters where the lint fiber is removed and collected to help make felt , absorbent cotton , mattresses , and even underwear . Mechanical hullers crack open the seed proper , and the rejected hulls start their way toward becoming fertilizer , dynamite , or stuffing for cheap baseballs . The kernels , or meats , emerge from a steam-jacketed cooker into hydraulic presses which squeeze out the oil that will be used to pack sardines , make butter substitutes , soap , and cooking oils . The cakes remaining in the powerful hydraulic presses are removed and broken up to feed cattle and rejuvenate the soil .  | Negroes , stripped to the waist , deftly handle the literal " hot cakes , " wrapping them for the presses into mats made of human hair from China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the presses is like that of hot buttered toast . At their lunch time we saw the workers dip their bread into the dripping oil , and eat the oil-spread slices with evident relish . " We do n't mind , " commented the manager . " No seed-mill worker ever gets pellagra . " STATE 'S EXPORTS WORLD WIDE Enter a bathroom of the leviathan Queen Mary and you encounter Mississippi composition board ; stroll along Atlantic City 's boardwalk or go aboard some British manof-war and your feet tread the State 's yellow-pine planks ; contract a cold in London , Australia , or Argentina and your prescription is apt to contain pine oil extracted from Mississippi stumps ; buy gasoline as you tour Italy or Japan and it may have been bleached by a distinctive product , bentonite , from the State some people call provincial . A plant at Jackson hauls in each week some 800 tons of bentonite , mined in Smith County . The soft , porous clay , sleek as an alligator 's belly , product of ash from volcanic eruptions of bygone geologic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mixed into a slurry , and treated with acids . You must climb a high platform to see the giant drum , covered with fine cloth , which draws the water content through a screen as it revolves , permitting the residue cake to be scraped from the outside . A glass-bottle works at Jackson best illustrates Mississippi as a customer of many States and foreign lands . Tons of old bottles from everywhere are piled high in the yard to be carried on moving belts to crushers , then to be mixed with sand from Arkansas , salt cake from Chile , lime from Ohio , barium from Missouri , feldspar from Colorado , arsenic from Montana , and selenium from Canada , to make enough bottles every day to supply one for each white family in the entire State . You can look , but not too long , through colored glasses into furnaces where these  | products and others from huge bins are melted by natural-gas flames at 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit . Seventy tons of raw materials are shoveled out of the bins for each day 's production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in carload lots , toward their ultimate destinations on drugstore shelves , cosmetic counters , nocturnal milk wagons , liquor cabinets , and beautyparlor tables . HAULING 118,000 PUPILS TO SCHOOL South of Jackson , at Crystal Springs , we came upon one of the most surprising aspects of Mississippi 's up-to-date educational system , its huge consolidated schools . This one has 1350 pupils , of whom 900 are transported daily . On the average 118,000 children are carried free daily in nearly 5,000 buses to and from more than a thousand schools . Some of the rural buildings are monumental is size and as modernistic in design as the gleaming new glass and chromium structures of Rome or Mexico City . Adjoining many are small apartmentlike dormitories , where teachers who used to " board out " now reside . In Crystal Springs still lives the alert , 86-year-old mother of a , baseball pitcher famous in southern collegiate games of the nineties , whom a breezy sports writer called " the long , tall canebrake sapling . " Later the " sapling " taught school until he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Eight years thereafter he defeated James K. Vardaman in a spirited race for the U. S. Senate , and now Senator Pat Harrison is one of the veteran and beloved statesmen in Washington . MOTORING BACK TO HORSE-AND-CARRIAGE DAYS Driving due west from Jackson to the Mississippi River bluffs , then south along the serpentine channel , was like leafing backward history 's pages through the " tragic era " of Reconstruction , to the memorable Siege of Vicksburg , and into the glamorous forties . Those were the days of melodrama showboats , palatial stern-wheelers , and proud Natchez planters who sailed up the muddy  | river to bring home European trees , Grecian urns , Spanish grilles , and French furniture , which still grace the mansions where their descendants live . Ten miles out of Jackson is Hillman College , founded in 1853 as the Central Female Institute . A historic catalogue of the following year advises parents : " The Boarders are allowed to spend no more than 50 cents per month for pocket money . Any young lady Dipping Snuff or bringing Snuff into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here , and elsewhere , to feminine education is a reminder that Mississippi also was a pioneer in " women 's rights . " In 1839 a bill was passed giving property rights to married women . The Pankhurst of that day was a Mrs. Hadley who kept a boarding house in Jackson frequented by members of the Legislature . The story goes that she endured no hunger strike herself , but put the legislative patrons on short rations until they acceded to her point of view ! WHERE SLEEP THE DEAD OF NORTH AND SOUTH As the motorist approaches Vicksburg over newly paved roads , the city still seems in a state of siege . Its sheer bluffs , rising 250 feet and more above where the Yazoo River joins the Mississippi , and the fertility of its rich loess soil that grows a versatile profusion of plants , give it more the aspect of a fortified city of the Rhineland than " the Gibraltar of the Confederacy . " A bird's-eye view of the area 's topography tells more vividly than the military books why Admiral Farragut withdrew his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grant and Sherman later abandoned their converging attack from the north ; and why General Grant finally evolved the amazing strategy of severing his communication lines and living off the enemy country while he doggedly laid the siege of 47 days in 1863 . The Vicksburg National Military Park is a crescent-shaped tract of rugged scenic beauty , aside from the 898 tablets and the 676 statues , monuments , markers , and other memorials along its 32 miles of well-kept roads . Most elaborate of these , perhaps , is the Illinois State Memorial , which inscribes in bronze , alphabetically arranged , the names of some 35,000 participants from that State . Tacit evidence of the healing hand of time is the annual meeting here of many  | members from the North and the South enrolled in an organization with t h e breath-taking title of " Descendants of the Participants o f t h e Campaign , Siege , and Defense of Vicksburg . " Bitterness has vanished , but the tactful Vicksburg visitor will not call " The War Between the States " a mere " Civil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tendered " or " presented " his sword to General Grant , and did not " surrender " it ( page 265 ) . If " the War " is mentioned , and it will be , he should not inquire " What war ? " nor smile if a lady speaks of visiting friends " up north in Virginia . " Lacy iron verandas that overhang steep streets , stately homes with hand-carved furniture , rose-tinted windows , and giant wine demijohns ; walls pierced by vagrant cannon balls , and the ante-bellum courthouse built by slave labor ? these and many other landmarks attest the proud history of the city of Vicksburg . THE LURE AND LORE OF VICKSBURG Many are the tales of the Prentiss House , once famous throughout the South for its cuisine and for its proprietor who scorned a printed menu and always presided at the table , calling out the day 's dishes in a rich , sonorous monotone . Most cherished possession of a few old Vicksburg families are faded war-time editions of the Daily Citizen , printed throughout the siege on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ named Swords , whose vitriolic comment on Yankees is recalled by General Grant in his Memoirs . INTO THE DEEPEST SOUTH South of Vicksburg , toward Natchez , the motorist approaches the ever-deeper South of movie sets and romantic fiction . Spanish moss smothers rugged oaks . 274 THE NATIONAL GEO ,  | The dank , shaded roads , sunk beneath auto-top level in many places , were not excavated by steam shovels , but by the slow erosion of countless wagon and oxcart wheels cutting the soft loess soil . Here are ghost river towns , sometimes wholly deserted since freight cars and trucks captured the cargoes of the awkward , blunt-prowed boats that once hauled corn , cotton , whiskey , and hides . Plantation homes , some dilapidated , others restored , attest the easy fortunes of the antebellum cotton boom . The new Irwin Russell Memorial Bridge spans Bayou Pierre ; near it still stands the gaunt hulk of the old bridge the Confederates burned in 1863 to check Grant 's approach to Vicksburg . Its rusty pylons , cables , railings , and iron crossbeams reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still are an engineering curiosity . To the wilderness here in 1788 came Samuel Gibson , self-taught stockman , gardener , beekeeper , planter , orchardist , and manufacturer , who boasted that he needed only to buy tea , coffee , salt , and sugar from the outside world . Here , too , some decades later , came Harman Blennerhassett , first ostracized in England for marrying his niece , then imprisoned for conspiracy in Aaron Burr 's empire enterprise , and built a plantation home retreat which he called La Cache . RADIO PANELS AND FAT CATTLE Even in this quaint town of Old World charm , its bank dimmed by a columned portico , eight churches within three blocks , and wide , tree-shaded streets with hitching posts and troughs for watering horses , there is a busy factory that turns out veneer panels and sounding boards for nationally advertised radio sets . At its annual Fat Stock Show and Auction Sale we met buyers from Illinois , Minnesota , and South Dakota . The Hermitage still stands , mansion of General Benjamin G. Humphreys , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have named his own home in Tennessee . General Humphreys , first governor elected after the War , was evicted from the Governor 's Mansion at Jackson , and compelled to walk between carpetbagger and negro troops , some of whom had been his own slaves . The best-known name here probably is that of Rezin Bowie , whose body rests in Port Gibson 's Catholic Cemetery . The knife , fashioned by a Philadelphia cutler from a blacksmith 's rasp after Bowie 's model , and first used by his brother in a duel at Natchez , is familiar wherever English is spoken . CROSSING THE NATCHEZ TRACE Mississippi is not an altitudinous State ? the highest point is only 780 feet above sea level ? but the highway from Port Gibson to Natchez presents the aspect of rugged mountain scenery . The sunken road , sometimes 30 feet deep , is flanked by escarpments that sheer off to steep declivities and look out over rolling woodland . Near Fayette is one of the few places where the romantic Natchez Trace is discernible . This Indian trail and subsequent planters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic seaboard Colonies and the Mississippi bluffs . Along it General Andrew Jackson marched his troops to the defense of New Orleans in the War of 1812 . Later it was a veritable Khyber Pass for highwaymen and bandits to prey upon travelers going east in stagecoach or luxurious carriage with the moneybags of their cotton-crop yield . Before entering Natchez one may visit Windy Hill Manor , quaint home of a planter , with its dormer windows in a transverse-ridge roof and its front-door fanlight of opalescent glass tinting its ingenious spiral staircase . Here , in 1807 , Colonel Benijah Osmun sheltered Aaron Burr after the latter 's release on bail . Beneath the moss-draped cedars and myrtles on its sloping lawn the courtly Burr met Madeline Price . After he forfeited his bond he risked capture by remaining at the neighboring cottage of Widow Price in a vain effort to persuade Madeline to flee with him . Natchez is the Williamsburg of Mississippi , with the startling difference that its citizens live on in their ancestral homes , which adhere to no set pattern or period . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grandee , English Tudor , French provincial , and Italian villa . Their conglomerate furniture and furnishings ranged from Chippendale to cloisonne , Salem to Neapolitan , early river steamboat saloons to Virginia Colonial , Imperial Peking to Patapsco.  | Over an Early American mahogany table still is suspended an India punkah which used to oscillate by handpower of a plantation negro in London town house livery . All this is credible only when you recall that Natchez gave allgiance successively to the flags of France , England , Spain , and the United States , not counting the Confederate interlude . Each occupation left its culture and columns and social castes . Moreover , in the gay and golden forties Natchez was accounted one of the richest towns of its size in all the world . Its cotton tycoons roamed Europe , New England , and Baltimore to sell their crops and spend their fortunes . A ship was chartered to bring from Europe the carved mantels , gold-leaf mirrors , and other furnishings of Stanton Hall . New England coastal houses of the period had their widow 's walks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can still climb the observation towers of Natchez homes where the lordly planter viewed his acres and his slaves at work . Faded household accounts show clothing of expensive cloth and stylish cut made to measure in Philadelphia at $100 a suit , and shoes from Boston and Paris at from $10 to $14 a pair . " There are old libraries here ; the letters and the oratory of those times abounded in Greek and Latin quotations ; why did they write so little in those days ? " I asked a student of the State 's history . " In New England of a comparable era , " he replied , simply , " Emerson , Thoreau , Hawthorne were writing a literature of protest . They sought a better life , a more gracious civilization . Natchez had it , and just lived it . " SHRINES OF FOUR FLAGS In a morning 's stroll around Natchez one may visit shrines of each occupation . The site of Fort Rosalie , founded by the youthful Bienville in 1716 , overlooks the riverside site of the notorious settlement " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ escaped slaves held sway while @#  | the reputable residents of " Natchez on the Hill " kept literally and figuratively aloof . The British , arriving in 1763 , left fewer traces than either the French who preceded them or the Spanish who followed , after the spirited Don Bernardo de Galvez , Spanish governor of Louisiana , captured the city 18 years later . Remaining are the spiral iron stairways , the hand-wrought iron railings , the enclosed gardens , and the broad verandas of the Castilian builders . Then came the Stars and Stripes , in 1798 , and soon the era of planters who erected homes that , even with slave labor , cost tens of thousands of dollars . Enormous rooms with lofty ceilings , carved panels of rosewood and mahogany , stately columns and elaborate gardens , huge fireplaces , broad galleries , doorknobs and hinges of solid silver all attest lavish and lordly expenditure . There is even a Moorish castle of 32 rooms , opening into a central rotunda and out upon encircling balconies . It has mantels of Egyptian marble , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mediterranean fruits , huge mirrors in gilded frames , and an intricate bronze candelabra . But the niches which were to hold imported statuary are empty , the place for a marble stairway ordered in Italy is vacant , and a library designed for the owner 's 10 , - 000 volumes is comparatively bookless , because the War interrupted the furnishing of this amazing mansion . Tools were thrown aside , scaffolding  | abandoned , buckets of paint were left to dry , and these remain today as more vivid evidence than landscaped battlefields or ornate memorials of the sudden shock of the call to civil arms . The very names of many estates have the euphony of romance : Melrose , Elmscourt , D'Evereux , Propinquity , Green Leaves , Auburn , Monmouth , Monteigne . A THREE-PERIOD HOME Richmond demands mention because it incorporates three parts which represent three Mississippi epochs . The central portion is provinial Spanish , with a shallow pitched roof , and a flaring outside stairway or iron balustrades leads to a balcony portico off the drawing room . Below are rooms with brick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddled . The back part is an austere two-story brick wing that might have been transported from Beacon Hill , in Boston . The front is an ornate example of the Greekplanter style , with a two-story portico supported by Ionic columns , and a Colonial entrance with Doric pilasters . Two treasured antiques within are the piano used by her accompanist when Jenny Lind sang in Natchez , and a cumbersome ante-bellum shower-bath device , operated by heavy hand-wrought iron gadgets , and called " portable . " Perhaps it was , when three or four brawny slaves were available to move it about . WHERE COTTON IS KING Retracing our route to Vicksburg , and driving north toward Greenville and Clarksdale , we plunged straight into the 278 THE NATIONAL GE &;  | Delta , that " strange land of huge plantations , feudalistic , cotton intoxicated , " the fiber empire of today that Natchez was a century ago . One road , that to Yazoo City , follows the sharp cleavage between Bluffs and Delta . To the right , sheep and goats graze on hills that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cattle and snowy cotton stretch across an unbroken plain . To the Mississippian " the Delta , " spelled with capitals , is not the Mississippi 's marshy mouths , but the Greek-lettershaped triangle between that river and the Yazoo ( map , pages 268-9 ) . There patient Nature laid down the tar-black alluvium and decayed leaf mold that form the richest cotton land this side of the benign Nile . This Delta " begins in the lobby of the Peabody Hotel in Memphis and ends in Catfish Row in Vicksburg . " It is as flat as a Netherlands landscape . In August towns loom like mirages on the pancake level of fluffy fields dotted with black men , women , and children , trailing their bags and singing as they pluck the white gold from the black-earth acres ( page 267 ) . Rows of willows , honey locusts , gleaming birches , cypress , and swamp hickory mark the mesh of rivers , creeks , lakes , and bayous that make this an area of thousands of inland islands . Like a lazy field hand the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ narrows , twists , and bends to avoid its self-made obstruction . Five or ten miles back of its course the land is lower than at the water 's edge . An endless array of negro cabins , some neat and whitewashed , others unkempt and dilapidated , surround the planters ' homes , stores , gins , and barns . LOAM , CLAY , AND " BUCKSHOT " SOIL Any Delta citizen will talk about soil with the fervor of a Californian praising sunshine , or a Gloucester fisherman sizing up a nor'easter . They teach soil in the schools , and talk about it before Rotary Clubs . A banker will assay the fine , sandy loam between thumb and forefinger as he passes upon a plantation mortgage . And when it comes to Yazoo clay and the underlying " buckshot " stratum then the paeans well to the tenderness of poetry . The late John Sharp Williams , senatorial " sage of Yazoo , " he of ready response and rapier wit , famed in Washington for World War and States ' Rights orations , won many home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirt . We drove out to the cotton plantations on cotton-reinforced auto tires , steered by a part-cotton wheel , to take a picture of a cotton gin with film that utilized cotton linters . The Pharaohs of this former flood plain are the affluent planters , also the corporations and northern insurance companies that now operate thousands of acres they took over during the cotton price slump . " But we are not in the cotton business ; we do n't want to go into the cotton busi- , ness , " insisted a Boston banker one day in 1931 . " Well , you all mixed in the cotton business in the sixties ; anyway , you are in it right now , " drawled a Delta planter as he laid a pile of mortgages on the banker 's desk , bowed low , and set forth for a trip to Europe . HOW SHARE CROPPING WORKS The negro provides the labor of this Dixie Egypt that grows enough pyramids of long-staple cotton to sheathe the structures of Cheops and pile up more besides . He represents more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most part he is a share cropper or tenant farmer ; sometimes he acquires a patch of land . " Uncle , did you ever think of buying land of your own ?

"  | To the plantation stores , which extend them credit from May " plantin ' time " until September ' pickin ' come the share croppers for their ' three M 's ' ? meat , meal , and molasses . One negro 's requisition always was : a peck of corn meal , three pounds of salt meat , one pound of coffee , one gallon of molasses , and one plug of ' Red Coon ' chewing tobacco . The only variation was that sometimes he preferred the chew ' Brown 's Mule " or " Dixie Land . " UNCLE SAM 'S BIGGEST COTTON FARM the Scott Farm , north of Greenville , illustrates how share cropping operates on a well-managed plantation , where owners find it profitable to keep workers healthy , happy , and contented to remain year after year . The Scott establishment is the principal holding of the Delta and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States . It uses mules , not tractors ; pays its workers by shares and not in daily wages ; and picks by hand , not by machinery . Thus it is typical except for its size , of many of the larger Delta plantations . The Scott Farm alone , exclusive of two subsidiary holdings ( at Deeson and Estill ) , spreads over an area nearly as large as the District of Columbia . On it live about 900 families , aggregating 3,300 people . In 1936 is sold 13,200 bales of cotton and more than 5000 tons of cottonseed . Managers of each of its eleven units report to a general manager and his staff . Among its experts are research scientists in breeding and a ' mule buyer " who cares for its 865 animals . There is a head blacksmith with a gang of helpers ( page 277 ) , a building crew to keep its more than 1,000 houses in repair , a meat-curing plant for its croppers , and a savings department where they may deposit their earnings . A physician is always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were delivered last year . Workers ' children attend seven county schools on the premises . Airplanes are hired to fly low over its fields and dush the plants with powdered calcium arsenate to poison the boll weevil . For the share cropper and his family the management furnishes a cabin , mules , fuel , water , tools , cottonseed , and credit for clothing , food , and other necessary provisions . Each worker of the family is allotted six acres to grow cotton , and two more acres for his own corn , vegetable garden , cow and pigs . Credit is extended at the rate of $1 per acre per fortnight . At the end of about 125 days the worker receives exactly one-half of the current price of the cotton he raised , the amount of his rations account is deducted , and he is handed the balance in a lump sum . In some poor years he may receive less than his store bill . Then the account is closed and the plantation takes that loss in addition to overhead . In 1931 the Scott @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year it paid a single tenant family of man , wife , and four children $1,480 for their share of a good crop . The Scott general store annually reports about $260,000 gross sales . Negro families at Scott own 280 automobiles , ranging from new cars to Model T 's and other museum pieces . At pay-off time some thrifty croppers buy a patch of land , some deposit their savings , others indulge their fancy for such characteristic Delta negro luxuries as gold teeth , riding on trains , and the inevitable " rolling the bones . " One faithful worker was all for buying his own mules when $350 was handed him . But his wife and children had other ideas , and they prevailed . He invested the lump sum in an automobile . He forgot about gasoline , but borrowed enough for a few trips . Then he had a puncture . Soon there came a freeze and cracked the radiator . He descended upon his family in a tirade of impotent indignation . " What did I tell you ? You got your auto ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's cracked up and no money to fix her . Next time I buys mules ; they drains theirselves ! " A GREENVILLE PILGRIMAGE , A. D. 2037 Greenville is the Natchez of today 's cotton empire of the Delta . One may imagine a Greenville Pilgrimage of 2037 , when alert young belles , wearing the tailored suits , short skirts , and quaint cubist hats of today , will meet visitors as they step from their airplane parking field to view the gracious homes , wide streets with trees down the center , and concrete levees sloping steeply to the river port . Already cacophonous cranes and windlasses have replaced the chanteys of roust-  | abouts , and tiers of barges anchor there instead of paddle-wheel palaces with mahogany bars , and mustache cups on long , laden tables beneath cut-glass chandeliers and carved ceilings with gilded mermaids . All the manual power of Washington County would have been taxed to load barges and freight cars with its 1936 cotton crop of more than 119,000 bales , from which planters realized nearly nine million dollars . That is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and about a million dollars in alfalfa and hay .

At Greenwood , which proclaims itself " the world 's largest inland long-staple cotton market , " the conversation is cotton , cotton , and more cotton . If you ca n't talk cotton with the shippers , the buyers , the factors , the planters ; or discuss gins , compresses , staple lengths , and cover crops , you will be lonesome there . In the cotton exchange gather the classers , those experts whose fingers are as sensitive to the 150 or so grades of cotton as a taster 's palate is to the flavors of tea .

" PEACH BLOSSOMS AND DOGTROT DWELLINGS It was peachblossom time as we drove from Grenada to Oxford . The pink orchards painted pastel patches against the backdrop of silvery cypress and gums , beech and birch . Every home , even the humblest " dogtrot " shanties , had peach-tree shade . The dogtrot house is as characteristic of Mississippi as its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has two rooms , with a floorless and doorless passage between , and a roof over all ( page 293 ) . It emerges now in more elaborate homes with additional rooms on each square side , and the dogtrot is a hallway . floored , furnished , and the doors often have graceful fanlights above . Prosperity has added porticoes with  | 291 columns . B u t still , all over the State , the cubic units and the passageway a r e retained . In contrast to the smooth Delta , with its crazyquilt stitches of bayous and irrigation ditches , the highland around Oxford drops into fields of eroded clay like folds of a blanket hanging over the foot of a cot . It is hard to believe that settlers once swarmed like locusts to this scarred and rumpled land . The sluggish Tallahatchie , tired and jaundiced with loam stripped from the watershed , once was laden with cotton cargoes " an artery pumping new blood into the lives of its upper valley with each throb of the Liverpool markets . " Then came the Var @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ William Faulkner writes about , often so poor now that they can not afford a mule to till the worn-out soil . At Coffeeville is a Soil Conservation Service Camp where some ten million black locust and other seedlings were grown last year to halt the scoop-shoveling of wind and rain . The Sardis Reservoir , at Batesville , will help , too . OXFORD AND " OLE MISS " Like an oasis in this newborn desert are the University of Mississippi ( Plate IX ) and the adjacent town of Oxford , treeshaded , with hitching posts and " heaven trees " in the yard of its white courthouse . Pigeons perch in the cupola with its clock of four faces that seldom agree ( page 272 ) . Here lived Lucius Quintus Cincinnatus Lamar , United States Senator , Cabinet member , and United States Supreme Court Justice , whose generous eulogy of Charles Sumner , of Massachusetts , helped heal the wounds of war and reconstruction . Jacob Thompson , of Oxford , served as Secretary of the Interior under James Buchanan , and subsequently was a Confederate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " of  | William Faulkner 's writings . In a Georgian home secluded by cedars and magnolias , seemingly as reticent as its master , lives the author whose folk novels are historic records of the desolate hill country . Another fragrant yard is the scene of the incident in So Red the Rose where a negro boy was shot and killed as he climbed a tree to hide from Federal troops as they entered the town . Stark Young was graduated from the University of Mississippi and later taught there ; Faulkner attended classes there for two troublous years . They tell at " Ole Miss " of the time when young Faulkner was postmaster at the university town , but his indisposition to carry a mailbag over to the railroad station until it was completely filled resulted in delays of letters , indignant complaints , and his severance from that job . Oxford has a general store , dating from 1839 , conducted by the fourth generation of its founder 's family . Great-grandchildren of its original customers shop there for evening gowns , overalls , lounging pajamas , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before our visit was an alert saleslady who once was the belle of levees , tilting tournaments , and the " infairs " of two generations ago which extended wedding festivities over two or three days .

Her keen memory failed her only when we ventured to ask her age . COEDS STUDY THE STARS Beneath a white observatory dome at Ole Miss we saw coeds studying the stars through a telescope and taking notes in large astronomy classes ( page 273 ) . The subject is elective , but about 200 students , nearly a fourth of t h e student body , take it . This celestial popularity is a living tribute to Dr. F. A. P. Barnard ( for whom Barnard College was named ) , prewar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and equip scientific laboratories of highest quality . Closest to his heart was the astronomical observatory , erected in 1859 , for which was planned the largest telescope of that time . The order for the instrument was placed with a firm of Cambridge , Massachusetts , and the casting of the disk was done in Birmingham , England . The telescope , with its 19-inch lens of flawless optical quality , was ready in 1861 , but the outbreak of the War prevented its delivery . On the first night it was set up in the maker 's shop it revealed for the first time the " companion star " of Sirius . Later it was mounted at Dearborn Observatory , of Northwestern University . Not until 1893 was a comparable instrument acquired at Ole Miss , which , with its accessory equipment , makes up one of the finest astronomical observatories available anywhere for daily use of students .

THE MIDWEST THRUSTS A FINGER INTO THE SOUTH Eastward from Oxford the red clay hills continue past Pontotoc , then drop away as suddenly as they rise from the Delta , and the Midwest seems to thrust a long peninsula into northeastern Mississippi . Wind-blown fields of grain and tinkling cowbells in well-watered pastures suggest level Iowa farms . Century-old Pontotoc still holds a " swapping market " on Saturdays . Boxlike churches in the country thereabouts have pine pews and no slave galleries .

" Consciously modern is much younger Tupelo , in the prairie , first city to contract for T. V. A. power , and a pioneer in building factories . The newness is emphasized now by more than 500 new houses built since the tornado of April 5 , 1936 , ripped up  | homes , schools , churches , and mammoth oak trees in its disastrous swath . COTTON , FROM FIELD TO GARMENT Cotton still prevails . From the Tupelo station platform one may see cotton growing in the fields , wagons and trucks converging along every road with their dusty bales , buyers and sellers fingering sample tufts as they argue prices , and the bales being hauled off again to near-by compresses , gins , warehouses . Across the street is a smokeless factory where the raw cotton from home farms is cleaned , dyed , made into yarn , and woven into cloth . Not far away the cloth is converted into men 's shirts , women 's house dresses , and baby clothes . Frequently 23 miles of cotton goods a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tupelo , unlike Delta towns , is not all cotton . Every morning fleets of trucks leave to pick up milk cans from farmers ' gates . Returning to a mammoth milk plant , they automatically pour the fluid into sterilized vats . Thence it passes to metal condensers , and is afterwards fed into carloads of tin containers , all without touch of human hand from milkmaid to can opener . In 28 acres of willow-shaded pools of the United States Fisheries Station are hatched hundreds of thousands of fish annually to restock the lakes and streams of the State . The hatchery 's location at Tupelo was a triumph of Private John Allen 's oratory . He concluded his famous plea with a grandiloquent peroration : " I can say , Mr. Chairman , that while there are larger places than Tupelo , I do not think there is any other place exactly  | like it . Tupelo is very near the center of the world . The horizon seems about the same in every direction . We have the ideal place for a fish hatchery at Tupelo . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get into the water we have at Tupelo . Thousands and millions of unborn fish are clamoring to this Congress today for an opportunity to be hatched at Tupelo . " South through collegiate Columbus and Starkville ( Plate IV ) , toward the busy wholesale and railroad center , Meridian , the prairie belt progresses . Milk plants , vegetable canneries , and cheese factories abound ; freshly painted big barns house prize cattle ; hay wagons and logging teams park in main streets . THE LAND OF THREE RIVERS It is less than 150 miles across the State to the Delta cotton towns of like latitude , but they are a thousand miles away in tradition and local flavor . The low Pontotoc watershed was a Rocky Mountain barrier to east-west communication in the days when commerce and travel flowed south along the parallel rivers that empty into the Gulf ( map , pages 268-9 ) . The planters clung to the sinuous Mississippi then , as now . The no-slave pioneers hewed clearings in the piney woods along the Pearl River . But the eastern settlements gravitated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ State for Alabama and empties into Mobile Bay . The Mississippi State College for Women , at Columbus , preserves the ideal of sheltered womanhood . Iron fences enclose the shaded campus ; students are not permitted to roam the town evenings without a chaperone ; freshmen and sophomores must wear all-blue uniforms . Upperclassmen are allowed to wear white jabots which , upon graduation , are initialed by the owners and passed on to cherished friends . A pioneer public school in Mississippi was Franklin Academy , founded in 1820 . Its building at Columbus still is in daily use . Woodsy Lee Park is not named for General Lee , but for the Stephen D. Lee who fired the first shot at Fort Sumter . Bustling , modern Meridian , though itself in the hills , is the shipping focus for the fruit , truck , and dairy products of the southern prairie . Its stockyard is the largest in the State . Meridian 's new stadium that seats 15,000 people is one evidence of the State 's keen interest in high school athletics . Educators are proudest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its 47.5 per cent of high school graduates who attend college . THE EPIC OF LAUREL Southwest from Meridian , on the edge of the famed piney woods , is Laurel , one of the State 's most startling cities ( Plate III ) . Here is a mill town with an art gallery , flowers and evergreens planted along railroad tracks , home-built model homes for workers , 25 active garden clubs , municipal golf courses and swimming pool , spacious parks , a high school with a collegelike campus ? a " planned city " which really was planned from its recent beginnings . One church , the First Presbyterian , which reproduces a 13th-century Gothic cathedral , engages nationally known musicians to give recitals on its 4-manual organ with 3,300 pipes . There are 700 titles of oratorios , anthems , cantatas , and solos in its musical library , and eleven pianos in its commodious clubrooms and parlors . The pulpit was done by a cousin of Anton Lang , the Bible box has an easel from the vicarage at K orbury , England , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Communion table is a rare old Persian rug . Pew ends are carved in designs recalling early days when woodsmen members made their own pews , hauled them to church , and set them up themselves . Laurel is in the northeast corner of the piney woods , which stretch over through Columbia , northward toward Jackson , and coastward almost to Gulfport . This land boomed with yellow pine prosperity , waned with the decimation of that natural resource , and rehabilitated itself by sheer human resourcefulness . From the Piedmont of the Carolinas and Georgia in the decade of 1815 migrated settlers who brought no slaves . Often they had little else than their oxen , hound dogs , and rifles to shoot deer and guard their stock from wildcats . They planted patches of corn and potatoes on river bottoms and home-raised a few pigs , cows , and chickens . In their secluded clearings these pioneers peeled logs for cabins with batten doors and windows . They made their own sugar . tanned leather in wooden troughs , manufactured soap from wood-ash lye , molded their own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from wooden pegs , and built their " tarpole " wagons so called because the center poles were greased with tar to make it easier for the oxen to drag them . Always there was a patch of potatoes and tobacco . One traveler , relating the rough but ready hospitality of a woodsman 's home , tells how at mealtime meats were garnished with potatoes , coffee was flavored with potato juice , side dishes of potatoes were served , and for dessert there was potato pie . At nightfall all retired to cots mattressed with potato vines , and , next morning , when he had a sore throat he was treated with a potato poultice moistened with vinegar . The party departed , their pockets stuffed with potato chips ! THE " FREE STATE OF JONES " Jones County , of which Laurel is the seat , still is referred to as the Free State of Jones because it voted not to secede from the Union in the sixties . Some of its citizens protested fighting what they called a " planters ' war , " and for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guerrilla campaign . In the seventies came the lumbering and logging boom . An old-timer summed up the area 's economic history in a sentence : " Grandpap was a sheep man , pappy was a farmer , I am a sawmill hand . " When the timber was cut , " dead towns " began to appear . You encounter a few there still with sagging sawmills , homes crumbling from neglect , and empty stores which seem sightless with their windowpanes gone . Farmers now flock back to abandoned acres and dig up stumps to feed insatiable naval stores plants . Saplings are hauled in by thousands of cords for the chemical miracle of making rock-hard composition board . In Laurel a genius of restless mind , apprentice of Edison and engineer , was impressed by sawmill discards of slabs , edgings , and sawdust , and by useless trees on marginal lands . He fed waste wood chips into a metal " gun " made from a piece of shafting , heated the sealed-up mixture by gasoline torches , " exploded " it by dislocating a pin with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old letter press , " just to see what would happen . " What ultimately happened was the vast Masonite plant which now employs a thouTO MISSISSIPPI 311 sand men , buys 500 cords of peeled young pine every day from hundreds of Jones County farmers , and ships out a million square feet ( which is nearly 23 acres ) of knotless " wood board " every 24 hours . EXPLODING WOOD BY STEAM That first steel gun , which they now keep in a safe , fired an industrial shot which is seen , if not heard , around the world ? in grainless fronts of Tokyo shops , in kitchens of jungle Malay posts , in a new office building near Milan , in Park Avenue penthouse billiard tables , in ocean steamship corridors , in Hollywood movie sets , and in speedboat hulls of many harbors . Now ceaseless streams of chips flow all through the 4-shift , 24-hour day into nine perfected " guns , " steam is shot into firing chambers , the guns are discharged by releasing the valves , and the chips explode @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " cyclone " separates fibers from steam the downy blanket of reddish brown creeps along by wire conveyer where suction boxes and roll presses squeeze out the water . Cutters even the edges and trimmers snip off 12-foot lengths . In chrome-plated hydraulic presses which exert about 500 pounds to the square inch , these pieces are squeezed and dried into hardwood boards , with tough fiber intact , bound by the natural wood cement . When I asked what these boards are used for , the inventor handed me a closeprinted list of seven pages , arranged alphabetically from acoustical panels and auto trailers to wardrobes and waste baskets . Other farm and forest products are bought by Laurel plants from farmers a hundred miles or more away sweet potatoes for its big starch factory , sugar cane for its syrup-blending plant , vegetables and fruits for its canning company , clay for a bentonite plant , pine stumps for its turpentine distillery . COLUMBIA INDUSTRIAL LABORATORY Driving southwest again , from Laurel , we visited Columbia , municipal experiment laboratory for Governor Hugh White 's ambitious and already successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Columbia grew around the White lumber mills , but when the area 's timber was cut off , this city , like others , faced disintegration until Citizen White , long before  | he thought of politics , evolved a diversified industrial program for his home town . We mistook a garment factory for a high school , what with its landscaped approach , modern brick construction , and many windows . Inside we saw 360 bolts of cloth , each 85 yards long , piled on a table where an operator guided an electric blade , shuttling 3,600 times a minute , cutting 181,440 parts for 8,640 shirts . Mere man must have become fashion conscious at bedtime , for here were 70 pajama styles to supply his sleeping sartorial whims . This one plant employs 780 people ; adjacent to it are parked daily from 320 to 350 cars which employees drive to town from a radius of 25 miles . More than half the 720 women here are high-school graduates . Across the street , in another lighted and ventilated factory , nearly a hundred workers were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Changing disks on a pattern drum regulates any of several hundred designs of stripes or clocking . The most surprising sight is the rows of aluminum boarding forms , to shape the socks , which look like the cross section of a gym class with the athletes ' legs aloft for their daily exercises . Summer sleep is disturbed at sunrise in Columbia ? but nobody minds by trucks , autos , carts , wagons , and an occasional ox team , clattering into town with loads of tomatoes , peas , sweet corn , beets , broccoli , beans , and turnip greens , according to season . These are bound for a canning factory , which sometimes loads four freight cars a day . Here as many as 60,000 cans of string beans have been put up in 24 hours . COUGH SYRUP FROM PINE STUMPS Utilization of stumps at plants in Columbia , and other places , is a Machine Age drama of how invention has rehabilitated waste acres . Crops carpet fields after farmers get paid for the stumps they pull up and haul @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a " hog " which chips them , and the chips are poured into a shredder which grinds them to ricelike fineness . Chutes feed this " sawdust " into extrac-  | tors where live steam is shot in to vaporize volatile oils in the wood . Steam then discharged , containing vaporized oils , is vented through condensers . The oil-and-water solution from the condensers goes to separators where the oils are floated off to storage tanks . At that stage the oil contains 80 per cent turpentine and 20 per cent pine oil . Separation of these is effected by distillation . Into the wood residue left in the extractors a solvent is pumped and , under high temperature and high pressure , a liquid emerges containing rosin . That which remains fires furnaces to " boil " more stumps . There are many more stages than these in the intricate chemical processes which the engineer compared to " killing a cat for the fur , feeding the cat to catfish in a pond , catching the catfish and feeding it to the kittens . " One marvels at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long ago chopped for some village church or yacht 's deck , which now yield turpentine for lithography and shoe polish ; pine oil for insect spray and cough syrup , synthetic camphor , soaps , and flotation in mines ; and rosin to finish paper , remove hair from hogs , dress belts , and stiffen linoleums . TUNG TREES AND PICAYUNE Still heading south , we drove from Columbia to Poplarville and Picayune , mile after mile fragrant with Satsuma orange blossoms , and field after field creamy and dubonnet with the bloom of new tung trees . Picayune , the town that was named for a New Orleans newspaper , in addition to established industries is tying its faith to a tung tree boom ( page 295 ) . Residents are endowing their alma maters and other institutions with tung tree acres . THE COASTAL COBWEB OF BAYOUS As distinctive geographically as the Delta are the coastal counties of Mississippi 's southern " panhandle " where five river sys-  | tems - the Pascagoula , Biloxi , Wolf , Jordan , and Pearl - and numberless seagoing bayous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 75 miles . Each of these rivers is extraordinary for its spiderweb of tributaries . For one example , Creole Bayou , a small tributary of the Pascagoula , has seven tributaries of its own . A sportsman may start fishing Creole Bayou Monday morning , cast every day of the entire week in new water , and on Sunday night be only four miles from his Monday starting point . Mississippi 's coastal area is adjacent to Nature 's famous hatchery , the Louisiana marshes , fertile spawning grounds of both crustacean and fish life . Hence countless tons of crabs , shrimp , and small fish are poured annually into Mississippi Sound and make their instinctive way up the various river basins to tidewater limits . Through incredible miles of rivers and bayous , fishermen angle for bass , barfish , crappies and perch , bluegills and sea trout . Chandeleur Islands might well be considered the Mississippi coast 's most valuable piece of real estate , even though they are part of Louisiana . For this broken sand strip , 23 miles long , runs north and south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and thus makes Chandeleur Sound a happy " grazing ground " for migratory fish . Lanes of fish migration are as clearly marked as beaten forest paths or steamship routes . Wintering off the great banks of Yucatan Peninsula , enormous schools of  | kingfish , Spanish mackerel , lemon fish , crevalle , bonito , dolphin , tarpon , and others funnel north in the spring to the Mississippi coast through the inviting Chandeleur Sound corridor . Trace the 7-fathom line along the Gulf coast and you mark off the shallow saltwater " dinner table " serving the rich daily meals that detain these migratory fish along Mississippi 's shores for the long sport fishing season from May to early November . SPANISH MOSS AND THE SPANISH TRAIL Eastward along the coastwise Spanish trail , marked by Spanish moss weeping from ancient oaks , we traversed one of the State 's most scenic and historic drives . From Bay St. Louis through Pass Christian , Gulfport , Biloxi , and Pascagoula , there are constant reminders that here were the oldest white settlements in the lower Mississippi Valley , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , oyster dredges and shrimp fishermen , beach bathers , and restful watering places that do not obtrude merry-go-rounds or chute-the-chutes . A BIRD LOVER 'S EDEN On few 60-mile drives can the bird lover identify so many varieties . For this shore of tree thickets , sandy beach , and marshes , along with the chain of offshore islands , is the neck of a migration bottle through which birds converge fanwise from wide expanses of the United States and Canada to radiate  | again over broad areas of their South American seasonal homes . Gulls , terns , and brown pelicans rear their young in Louisiana and Alabama and feed in the Mississippi Sound . These and the black skimmer ( locally , the shearwater ) , both the royal and Caspian terns , and the laughing gull are seen all spring and summer long . The more northern gulls ? herring , ringbilled , and Bonaparte 's arrive during winter months . Flocks of shore birds include 35 species of sandpipers and plovers and often contain hundreds of individuals . The light plumage of the Cuban snowy plover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement denotes its presence . Hardier Nature lovers who penetrate the salt marshes may come upon the Louisiana clapper rail and Howell 's seaside sparrow , which have a very narrow range ; the least bittern and many kinds of herons , notably the stately egret , multiplying again after nearly being exterminated by plume hunters . In the piney woods are the pine warblers and the brownheaded nuthatch ; that southern songster , Bachman 's sparrow ; and the red-cockaded wood - pecker , which smears the opening of its nest cavity , dug in a living pine , with a patch of pitch . " OYSTER MA-A-N FROM PASS CHRISTI-A-AN ! " Cotton fields and factories seem remote , indeed , as one idles along the sea-wall road of Pass Christian . Yachts and yawls ride the waters and , landward , honeysuckle , wild cherries , roses , and trumpet vines climb the fences of white cottages . Down these streets once came the oxteam caravans , six and eight yokes long ,  | bearing hides and venison , furs , honey , gophers ( land burrowing tortoises @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this resort , with its summer homes of up-State and New Orleans business men , is broken only by the throb of oyster-boat engines and the street cries of " Oyster ma-a-n from Pass Christi-a-an . " Gulfport , lying at the apex of the deepwater V of the pass between Cat and Ship islands , is essentially a farm and forest products port ( page 296 ) . Yellow pine still is shipped , but now , in addition , we saw crossties and piling consigned to South America , rosin to Liverpool and Hamburg , cotton to England and Italy , composition board to Oaxaca , and coals to Newcastle in the form of fish to Massachusetts . From this young city 's neat bungalows , with infant palms and newly planted shade trees , through up-to-date colonies of tourist cabins and trailer parking lots , one arrives suddenly plump into the mellow past and French traces of venerable Biloxi . BILOXI ONCE CAPITAL OF HALF THE UNITED STATES Here is the Plymouth Rock , the Jamestown , of the deep South ? the city that once was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yellowstone National Park to the site of present-day Pittsburgh . Its romantic annals run far off the main tracks of American history ; the names of its heroes seem strange to eastern ears . Imperious Hernando de Soto , who marched a magnificent army through the wilderness to the river he called the Rio Grande de la Florida , and Rene Robert Cavelier , Sieur de la Salle , who toiled down the Mississippi and laid spacious claim to its whole watershed for Louis XIV , are known at least for cars that bear their names . Other founders also came down from Canada or direct from Europe , not from the Atlantic coast Colonies . There was Tonti of the " iron hand , " La Salle 's loyal companion , whom the Indians regarded as a miracle man when his artificial member cracked down on their recalcitrant skulls . Thrilling were the deep-sea and bayou adventures of the tactful Pierre le Moyne , Sieur d'Iberville , who found Ship Island with the help of a pirate guide , made friends with the gentle Biloxi Indians , and named the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , was Jean TO MISSISSIPPI 317 Baptiste le Moyne , Sieur de Bienville , who took the helm of the remote and sickly colony when he was only 22 years old , gave nearly forty years of his life to the French settlements , and founded Mobile and New Orleans . France , Spain , and England ; territorial Louisiana , Georgia , and West Florida ? all were sovereign here , at times ( Plate I ) . " One reason so many lawyers came here , " an elder citizen explained , " was because land titles along parts of the coast involved 22 different tenures , even including recent claims of the State of Georgia . " They still serve you French coffee in bed in the morning in Biloxi . Venders call colorful " soup bunches " ? carrots , beans , tomatoes , and various greens ? all made up in proper proportion for a favorite Provencal vegetable soup .

French and Dalmatian fishermen man the shrimp and oyster boats , and their daughters work in the canneries which ship their stock to our Middle West and inland Mexico . The Blessing of the Fleet is an ancient Norman custom which makes a colorful August ceremony . On still , dark nights the velvety beach is lighted by hundreds of eerie flares that smoke like the frost-time smudge pots in the tomato fields of Crystal Springs . These are the torches of giggers , who spear flounders , a flat-bodied fish with both eyes on one side of its head , which swims in the shore waters and burrows into the sand ( p. 301 ) . THE MOUNT VERNON OF THE SOUTH Most revered of many historic places near Biloxi is Beauvoir , Mount Vernon of the Confederacy , the postwar home of Jefferson Davis ( page 312 ) . Built in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ basement , with floor-to-ceiling windows , a broad gallery , and wide central hall . The original builder of the fifties is said to have pulled its cypress from the Louisiana swamps and carried the logs as far as Lake Pontchartrain by camels . On the front lawn is a statue to the pet dog of the Confederate leader 's daughter ,  | who forsook her northern suitor to be her father 's companion . Would you delve deeper into lotus land ? Drive on then to Pascagoula , which was " unperturbed by the American Revolution , by the creation of the United States Government , even by the War between the States . " Be prepared to believe that its river really " sings " ? a monotone song , they say , like the humming of myriad bees in flight ? and leave it to the geologists to settle whether the " song " is generated by grating of sand on slate bottom , by escaping natural gas , or by a queer species of fish .

At Moss Point a huge factory produces white paper from yellow pine ; another makes paper into bags for shoppers in fardistant cities . Experts fashion fish lures and decoys . Jackson County growers ship from here the papershell pecans and other varieties they developed . Yet , circled by sterile pine ridges , cupped in a flat bowl of marshy bayous , its traffic impeded by a toll bridge , Pascagoula seems sequestered from affairs that trouble men elsewhere from Spanish revolution , sitdown strikes , resettlement projects , or Su- preme Court debates . A woman was hanging out the week 's wash at the 219-year-old Spanish fort , with its walls of oyster shells bound by moss and mortar masonry . Grass grew high in a historic cemetery with its horizontal slabs , foreign language epitaphs , and rusty wrought-iron crosses . THE WEATHER AND THE JONESES Pascagoula is busy , but never restless .
