THE DAUGHTER OF A PRINCESS A STORY BY CHARLES CALDWELL DOBIE I AST evening when I came home from the bakery where I work I saw . A a handful of household goods on the sidewalk before my lodgings . My landlady stood in the doorway , and a man was carrying a small trunk on his back up the long blue flight of steps . " Josef Vitek , " my landlady called down to me , " what do you suppose has happened ? " " Why , we have a new lodger , of course , " I laughed back at her . " Two new lodgers , " said my landlady as I came up to her . " But that is not all . One of them is a princess . " " A princess ! " I cried . " Yes , a princess , " replied my landlady . " But she is not a young princess out of a fairy story such as you imagine . She does not wear a crown . Her hair is very white , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know that she was a princess . I can not tell you why but as soon opened the door to her ring I saw she was a noble person . " " I know what you mean , " I answered . " A princess such as you describe used to come and walk in the monastery gardens at Polna in Bohemia where I learned my trade . She used to come every morning and walk among the roses . She wore a long black cloak and a little black bonnet . At a distance you might have thought she was a nun but when you came closer you saw that she had a proud face and a proud way of carrying her head . Yet , she was very poor and she had many griefs . " " They are all like that ! " said my landlady . " When plain folk Iike you and me are in trouble we can bow our heads and weep . But a. princess must keep her back straight and her eyes flashing . .. ? No , I do not envy them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " But who is the second lodger ? " " Ah ! " answered my landlady , shaking a playful finger at me . " The second lodger will be more to your taste . A slip of a girl who is the Princess 's daughter . You will lose your heart to her , Josef Vitek , if I am not mistaken . " " I hope not ! " I answered gravely . " For there is no happiness in loving above one 's station . " And saying this I went into the house . The room in which I sleep is on the second floor of my landlady 's house . It is a small room but it looks out upon a street and across to a public park . This park is upon a hill and from it one can see the city below gay or gray as the weather makes it . For San Francisco is a city of mists and sunshine . This evening there was a fresh breeze blowing in from the sea , and a cold wind was bending the plumes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my curtain because I like to watch trees dancing in the wind , and at that moment I saw two women coming up the front steps . One was in black and one was in red , and at once I said to myself , " The woman in black must be the princess and the woman in red must be her daughter . " In a moment I heard the front door THE DAUGHTER close and the creak of stairs , and I knew that they were mounting to their lodgings which were across the half from mine . I listened at the door so that I might discover their country from their speech . But when I heard the French tongue I said to myself , " That proves nothing . " And I was more curious than ever . I threw myself on my bed , for I was very tired . From across the hall came the patter of feet and the noise of tables and chairs and trunks being moved  --  and the tap of a hammer and all the happy sounds that come from setting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It would be pleasant if I were helping them . There must be heavy things to lift . " And while I was wondering about this I heard a scream and a door opened suddenly . I came to my feet and opened my door . In the hallway stood the young woman in red . " Oh , please ! " she cried . " Will you not help me ? My mother has fainted ! " I followed her into her lodgings . The Princess lay upon the fluor . I lifted her up and carried her to a couch . The young woman in red brought a glass of water . I put it to the Princess 's lips . She opened her eyes . " You are very kind , " she said . Then she turned to her daughter . " I think I shall go to bed , " she whispered . As she said this she tried to rise . " Had I not better carry her into the next room ? " I asked . " No ! No ! " cried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carry me but you may help me ! " And her eyes flashed as she said this . I felt my cheeks burn . She put one arm in mine and another in the arm of her daughter , and we walked slowly into the bedroom . She seemed feeble but she held her head high , and I knew then that she was a princess and no mistake . I came from the Princess 's bedroom and sat down near the spot where she had fallen to the floor . Before these new lodgers had come to it this room had been a sad , gray room but now already it seemed gay . On the table was a. bright scarf and on the walls pictures in gold and silver frames . In a corner on a shelf was a. gilded icon with a lamp already burning before it ; a burnished samovar sat high up on a chest of drawers . If I had seen only the icon I should have thought that the old lady was a Greek princess . For did not my Greek friend who worked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his room , with a taper burning before it ? But , seeing the samovar , I said to my . self , " This is a Russian princess ! " And I knew at once why they had fallen upon evil days . At that moment the young woman in the red dress came out of the bedroom . " 1 see you are Russian , " I said , pointing to the samovar . She smiled and nodded . " How is the Princess ? " I asked . " Princess ? Ah , you know everything there is to know about us . Who are you  --  a captain of the police ? " She showed a row of white teeth pleasantly . " My mother is better . Moving is always tiresome , and we did not even take time to make a cup of tea . My mother says , ' Women think of food for everyone but themselves . " As I have said , she showed her teeth pleasantly while she spoke , but her smile did not deceive me . I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacked food . And suddenly I thought of the plate of fruit which my landlady always puts on the table beside my bed . I left her to fetch it and in a moment I came back with a blue dish that had two yellow pears and a bunch of black grapes upon it . I put the fruit down on the table and I saw my new friend 's eyes sparkle . " Pears ! " she cried , and she bent down to smell their fragrance . " Do they make you think of home ? " I asked . " How did you guess ? " " By the light in your eyes . " For answer she put one of the pears to her lips , and I saw her white teeth bite into it . " When 1 was a child , " she said , " I used to love the time when the pears ripened better than any time of year . I can see now , if I close my eyes , the pear trees bending under their burden . I can see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the long , summer evenings , and smell the sweet smell of the fruit ripening in straight rows in the storehouse . Yes , you are right pears make me think of home . They make me think , too , of the day we left it . My father had been warned that he was to be taken . It was a summer day and the pears were ripening . I remember I went out into the orchard and filled my apron full of hard , firm fruit . Even in his sorrow my father laughed at me . But the next day when we were in flight we had pears along the roadside . " A mist came into her eyes and I said , " Do you ever wish to go back ? " She shook her head . " Only as one wishes sometimes to redream a dream . " " Your father is dead ? " ayes. , , " And your brothers and sisters ? " " There is a sister in Paris . She keeps a shop there . And a brother still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother and me . For ten years he has been trying to escape . He leads a false life for fear that one day someone will bring charges against him and have him shot . When he writes to us his letters are gay and full of happiness . He dares not have them otherwise . But we hear from others , through my sister in Paris , the real story . . . . From one day to another we do not know . At this moment he may be dead ! It breaks my mother 's heart . There is no sacrifice too great for her to make to save him . She loves him better than anything else in the world ! " " Better than you , her daughter ? " I inquired . " A daughter whom a mother loves better than her life ? . . . How little you know ! " And , as she said this , she shook her head merrily . All the next day while I worked I thought of the Princess and her daughter . It was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of little tarts with the dough that fell from the pie plates as I scraped their edges . I made a row of little tarts with this dough and filled them with spoonfuls of jam that still clung to the empty jars . For I thought , " These new friends of mine will he hungry again to-night , and it will be nice to bring them a present . " After the large pastries had been put in the oven I set the tarts in a row before the oven door . My Greek friend , who works beside me , said , " What are you doing , Josef , baking a feast for a doll 's house ? " But I laughed and said , " I am baking a feast for a princess and her daughter ! " He gave me a mocking look . " A princess and her daughter ! Do not tell me that you have fallen in love again ! " I shook my head . " In love with the daughter of a princess ? . . . That would be folly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All love is folly ! " said he bitterly . And I remembered Miriam the Jewess who had danced in the Greek coffee houses , and the terrible woman with the sharp teeth who had once snared my heart and I said nothing . That night I walked home quickly . I went at once to my room and washed myself and I put on a clean shirt and a bright tic . Then I took the freshly baked tarts and stood before the door of the Princess and her daughter , my heart beating strangely . I wondered what I should say to them for , suddenly , I remembered that I was but a baker . At that the door opened and the Princess herself looked up at me . " Ah , so it is you ! " she said . " I heard footsteps coming this way and then a silence . . . . Footsteps and then a silence always fills me with dread . . . . It is so with everyone who has lived among spies . " She stood aside and made a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not know it , " I began . " But I am a baker by trade and to-day I made some pastries . I brought a few to you . I thought they would be nice to eat after you had finished your evening meal . " She took the tarts from me and her thin hand shook . " I think they will be much nicer now , with my tea , " she answered . " My daughter Lubov will be in any moment , and I have been getting the samovar in readiness . " She carried the tarts to a table and set them down . " You were the youth who helped us last night . I ate your black grapes this morning . They tasted like captured sunlight . . . Lubov tells me she let you know a word or two of our story . " She said all this very graciously , but I felt ill at ease . I wished that her daughter Lubov might come back . " You have a son , " I began . . . A look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lubov tell you ? Every night I pray for him . Every night I wonder whether he is alive or dead . My daughter in Paris hears of him , from people who conic and go . She is trying to use her influence with those who have friends in power so that he may leave the country . On some pretext , you understand . For every moment that he stays is full of danger . Every moment that he stays there is danger that they may find him out for what he is  --  an aristocrat at heart . An aristocrat who is pretending until the moment comes when he may escape . .. . My daughter in Paris , as I have said , is trying to use her influence . But she is not beautiful , she has no charm . Now , if I could be there with my Lubov ! " She lifted her hands and let them fall again . At that moment Lubov entered the room . At that moment Lubov entered the room , and it was as if the sun suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our neighbor across the hall has brought us , " said the Princess . " He tells me that he is a baker and he has made these with his own hands . " I looked at Lubov . Her eyes were shining . " How nice you are ! " she said to me . " Pears and black grapes last night and to-day a dish of pastries ! " " Did a letter come from Paris ? " asked the Princess . " No , " answered Lubov . " Olga has forgotten us . But one came from Moscow . " The old lady made the sign of the cross . " Ah , then , Grigory is safe ! " " Who knows ? " replied Lubov . " For it is a very old letter . It has followed us through Siberia into China and across the Pacific . It had so many postmarks and directions on it that the official at the post office could scarcely make out to whom it was addressed . " " Old or new , " said the Princess , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he say ? " Lubov shrugged . " That he is well and happy . And that the country prospers under the new rule . He says also that the police are vigilant . He says , ' Every day they make fresh arrests of those who are traitors to the glorious cause ! " ' " God help us ! " cried the Princess with a trembling voice . " It is thus he warns us of his danger . " " If it is an old letter , " I said , " perhaps the danger has passed . " The Princess shook her head . " If we were only in Paris . . . If we were only in Paris ! " she kept repeating . " What could we do in Paris ? " demanded Lubov . " What could we possibly do ? " " I do not know exactly , " answered the Princess . " But , I am sure there would be things to do . There would be men of influence to meet . " " But Olga is there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you do not understand , Lubov . You are too young to understand . Olga does what she can . But there are things that are beyond her . Your sister has a heart of gold , but a heart of gold is nothing at a time like this . Some day you will understand that , Lubov . " A cloud passed over Lubov 's face but it vanished quickly . " Let us have . our tea and our pastries , " she said . And she began to arrange glasses on a tray . She took a withered lemon and cut it into thin slices while the Princess went in search of sugar . Presently the glasses were full of steaming tea the color of amber . We drew up to a low table . Lubov passed the glasses and the plate of pastries . I took a very small pastry out of politeness . The Princess and Lubov ate slowly as they sipped their tea . And I thought , " How slowly they eat . And yet they are starving ! " The weeks went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ friends had money and food for a few days . But for the most part I knew that all they had to stop their hunger was tea brewed when they heated water in the samovar . At such times I brought a fresh loaf with me from the bakery , or some cinnamon rolls , or I baked some tarts for them as I did on the first day . I would think all the way home about an excuse for offering these things to the Princess and her daughter . For I discovered that it was as my landlady had said : People of noble birth must always be pretending  --  that they are happy , that they have enough to eat and drink , that things are well with them . That was why I said nothing to my landlady of their condition . She is a kindly soul , and while she could guess their pride , she would not have the wit to invent an excuse for helping them . Once my landlady said to me , " Josef , how do these people live ? Sometimes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rent . And then suddenly everything is settled . " " There is a rich daughter in Paris , " I answered , going at once to my room . For I thought , " If they wished her to know the true condition of things they would have told her . " I did not like to think that they lacked food , but the evenings when I hurried home from the bakery , with a crisp loaf under my arm for them , were happy times . Even before I came near their door I could smell the charcoal burning in the samovar and I knew that they were waiting for me . I knew that they were hoping that I would come even though they would pretend that my knock had startled them . On these evenings we would sit , sipping our tea out of tall glasses and talking about pleasant things . I would talk about the city of Prague near where I was born , and how the sunset lighted up the windows of the Archbishop 's palace that stood upon a hill , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little village of Polna . Lubov would describe the white winter in her country and the chiming of sleigh bells and the golden domes of the churches . And the Princess would tell about the serfs that her grandfather had once owned and the jewels that she had seen at the opera when St. Petersburg was the great city , and the splendors of the Tzar . In the evenings which followed a letter from Paris I came empty handed to their door . For I knew that they would have cheer of their own providing . But on these evenings the talk was not so happy . For the Princess would speak of her son and of the latest news from Moscow , and she would sigh for Paris and lament that her daughter Olga had a heart of gold but no further weapon for turning disaster aside . And Lubov would wear a troubled look . And my heart would be heavy . Sometimes on my way home from work I would meet Lubov , hurrying back to her mother from an errand . Often she took embroidery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her spare moments she contrived neck bands and cuffs and scarfs in the fashion of her country for those who wished to be gay . If a trade wind blew in from the sea we quickened our steps , thinking of the steaming samovar at the end of our journey , but if the air was still and warm we walked slowly . We walked slowly when the air was warm , and often we sat for a moment in the public square at the top of the hill . We sat upon a little red bench watching the sunset flame the western windows , and Lubov spoke of the things that were dear to her heart . As for me , I said little , for the things close to my heart could not he spoken . For was not Lubov the daughter of a princess and I a simple baker plying my trade ? Sometimes she told me of those terrible days when they seemed forever in flight , when life was one hiding place after another . And I would say to her , " How you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life you might have led if these things had not been . " Then she would turn her beautiful gray eyes upon me and say : " I would not have it otherwise . If these things had not been , my life would have remained as still and calm as a shallow pool . . . . I was but a child the day I gathered pears in the orchard and fled with my father and mother into the world . But even at that age I had been spoken for in marriage . Our neighbor , who was a worthy man , had a son who would one day have me for his wife . He would have been an officer in the Tzar 's army , and I should have married him and brought him a dowry , and that would have ended everything . As it is , I have seen the world . It is strange and hard and cruel . But it is also very beautiful . I should have missed so many things if I had remained forever like a sheep in a green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suddenly she would put her hand on my cheek and turn my face toward her and say : " Why , if these things had not been , I should have missed you , Josef I " At that my heart would beat and my cheeks would flame . And , again , I would remember that she was the daughter of a princess and I nothing save a baker from the little village of Polna , where my father keeps a guest-house . And so I would keep from my lips that which was so close to my heart . As time went on there came news of prosperous days from Paris , The shop run by Lubov 's sister had great success , and with every letter there was money . I no longer baked pastries from scraps of dough for these friends of mine , because they had rich fare now , in the fashion of their country . When I returned from my work in the evening I would stop for a moment before their door and listen to the sounds of laughter and good cheer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a company of ladies and gentlemen who came to gather round the samovar and drink tea . I was happy that they had so much good fortune but I was sad too . For I saw Lamy now but seldom . Yet , how could it have been otherwise ? I was but a poor baker , and they had once been grand people and might , with God 's help , be so again . One day , when I was climbing up to my room , I met my landlady coming down from the Princess 's lodgings . " Ah , Josef , my son , " she said , " we shall soon have the house to ourselves again . " " What do you mean ? " I inquired . " Are the Princess and her daughter taking grander quarters ? " She shook her head . " That I do not know . But , grander quarters or not , they are leaving for Paris next week . " " Paris ! " I cried . And I felt my heart stand still . That night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so I w ent boldly and knocked upon the door . The Princess herself opened to me . Lubov was not there . " Come in ! Come in ! " cried the Princess gaily . And once I was seated she said , " Have you heard the news ? " " Then it is true ? " I said . " I mean , you are going to Paris ? " " Yes  --  at last ! " And she gave a happy sigh . " Olga has written asking us to come . She realizes that the time is at hand to strike a blow for my son . There is a man who has arrived in Paris from Moscow named Samaroff . He comes to my daughter 's shop in Paris in the name of friendship . But Olga is not deceived . She knows his true mission . " " And what may that be ? " I asked . " To spy upon people . To find out what communications the folk out of Russia have with those within . But , Olga is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has no fear . " " Pear ? " I said . " What has she to fear ? She is not in Russia . " " But you forget , my son still is . One false step and word would go back to Moscow that Grigory is not a desirable citizen . " She gave a little shiver . " Even now I grow sick when I think of what might happen before Lubov and I can get to Paris . Olga is clever , she has a heart of gold . But , as I have said before , she has no beauty , no charm . " She gave me a strange look as she said this , and I guessed what was in her mind . I guessed what was in her mind and I could find no words in which to reply . So I rose and said : " You make me very sad ! " And so I left her . I could not eat any supper ; instead I went out at nightfall and walked the streets of the town . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old woman and the next moment I would say to myself , " Josef Vitek , what folly ! She is a noblewoman and a Christian in the bargain . Such people do not throw innocence in the path of evil ! " I thought of every Russian I had ever met . I tried to picture in my mind this man Samaroff who came to Paris to spy upon his countrymen . Had he a flat face and a head close-clipped , or was his nose long and sharp and cruel and were his eyes greedy like a pig 's ? . . I even went that night to a caf ? that I knew was frequented by countrymen of the Princess . It was run by a woman from the Volga district who said that she was a daughter of an admiral . It was a very gay place , with gaudy pictures painted upon the wall and an orchestra in embroidered smocks , wearing high hats trimmed with white astrakhan . The leader was a dashing fellow who danced in high boots while the orchestra echoed his shouts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were like this I should not mind so mulch . At least he would he young and gay . " But I knew that a man who went about spying could not be such a one . I ordered a dish of beet soup and some slices of black bread , for by this time I felt hungry . A man sitting opposite me was eating a pancake spread with caviar and sour cream . He was a thin man with a kind face . The music stopped , and we began to talk . We talked at first about nothing at all , but presently I found myself speaking of the Princess and Lubov . My companion had heard of them though he did not know them . " And do you know a man named Samaroff ? " I asked . " He has something to do with the present government and he spends a great deal of time in Paris . " " If he is the same man I think he is , I can remember nothing to his credit , " replied the thin man sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he is without God or a conscience . He is a man of iron , but he has one weakness . " " And what is that ? " I inquired . It ' Women , " replied my companion , " young women . " I felt suddenly sick . My companion looked at me sharply . " What has this Samaroff done to you ? " he asked . I shook my head for at that moment I could not speak . The orchestra began to play again and the gay leader to dance and shout . All during the dance I kept asking myself , " Shall I tell this man ? Shall I tell what is in my heart to a stranger ? " But before the dance was finished I knew that I should tell him everything because he was a stranger . When there was silence again I told him everything . " Is it not shameful ? Is it not shameful , " I demanded , " to think of a mother who .. . " He put his hand on my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a daughter . That is the terrible thing about life . One must always make aschoice . " " I know what my choice would be ! " I cried . " Naturally , " returned my companion . " But , then , you are not the mother of a son . " " If the son would die ! If the son would only die ! " I said . " Things in life are never that easy , " said my new friend sadly . I gave a little shiver . For in that moment I knew that I had wished for the death of a man who had done me no harm . The days went by . I did not see Lubov or the Princess but 1 knew that they were making ready to depart I would lie upon my bed in the twilight , listening to them moving about and hearing the tap of a hammer , the scrape of a chest being drawn across the floor , the sound of a book falling from someone 's hand  --  all the sad noises that come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and think , " What if tomorrow word would come that this son in Moscow is dead ? " But when I asked myself , " Do you wish this thing to come to pass , Josef Vitek ? " I would cover my face and shiver . At last there came a Sunday when the lodgings of the Princess were thronged with people . All day long a company of ladies and gentlemen came and went . They climbed the stairs laughing , and they left as gaily , calling out , " Good-by ! Good-by , darlings ! What luck to go to Paris ! " I used to listen for a word of sorrow . I used to listen for tears in the voice of the Princess  --  for tears in the voice of Lubov . But even their voices were gay as they called after all who departed , " Keep well ! If you come to Paris , look us up ! " Could it be , I thought , that even Lubov was happy ? Toward nightfall the company had all departed . Even Lubov @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I heard a tap upon my door . I rose and opened it , thinking that my landlady had brought me a red apple or a handful of cakes . To my surprise the Princess stood before me . " Mr. Vitek , " she said pleasantly , " will you come with me ? I have a present for you . " I followed her without a word . The room that had been so bright looked like a dead thing . The smoke from cigarettes was in the air , and in a corner stood trunks and corded chests . Nothing remained as it had been except the samovar glistening in its place high up on a chest of drawers . " You have been so kind , Mr. Vitek , " began the Princess , " that Lubov and I have decided to leave our samovar with you . We thought you might like it . We thought it might make you remember the pleasant evenings when you drank tea with us . " " Already they seem long ago , " I answered . " Yet I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Princess drew herself up . " You do not wish the samovar , then ? " " Forgive me ! I do not know . . . . If I could forget those happy times I think it would be well . " The Princess frowned . " When you are as old as I am , Mr. Vitek , " she answered , " you will know that happy times are for just that thing  --  to be remembered . " " Even if they bring pain ? " " Even if they bring pain . But come , you are talking nonsense , Mr. Vitek . Why should the memory of a pleasant hour with two passers-by give you pain ? We are like travelers who meet upon the roadside and pass on . " I am a simple man but I am not too simple to know that the Princess meant to rebuke me : I was but a baker and she a woman of noble birth . Yet , I remembered that she had broken bread with me , so I said : " I am sad @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going fills me with unhappiness . . . . When I think of Lubov  --  when I think how young she is  --  when I think . . . " " What right have you to think about Lubov at all ? " said the Princess with a voice of ice . " My daughter knows her duty . " I saw she wished me to leave . but I knew that I should never see her again , so I said : " You have a heart of stone ! You have a heart of stone or you would not sacrifice your daughter ! " She gave me a strange smile . " You talk like all men , " she said bitterly . " You talk like all men who pretend to believe that women are made for anything but sacrifice . " When I got back to my room I said to myself , " They must be leaving soon . Perhaps to-morrow . If this is so , I shall never see Lubov again . " At first I thought this might be best , but the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the last time . She had gone out , and I felt sure that she would not be long away , so I went down and stood upon the sidewalk before the house , waiting for her return . It was a warm night , and in a near-by garden a twisted magnolia tree sent out perfume from a few sad buds . I walked up and down , up and down , and presently I saw her in the distance . But she did no I come up to me . Instead , she crossed to the other side of the street and halted in the public square , looking down upon the city twinkling at her feet . I went over and stood by her . She turned and gave me one look . I felt for her hand and we stood there silently . At last I said : " You were going away without a farewell . " " Yes . " " Must you go ? " " Yes . " " Are you happy ? " She withdrew her hand . " Yes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she , too , was rebuking me as the Princess had before her . I felt a hot anger stir me and I said : " If you knew . . if you knew what was in store for you ! If you knew about this man Samaroff ! " She turned and gave rue a proud look . " Josef Vitek , you forget yourself ! " she cried . I felt as if she had struck me and I covered my face with my hands . I covered my face with my hands and I stood there with hot tears streaming between my fingers . . . . I felt her lips pressed against first one hand and then the other . . . . I opened my eyes . Lubov had disappeared . I could not go back into the house . Instead , I went and sat in the Russian cafe run by the woman from the Volga district . At midnight my thin-faced friend , who had told me about Samaroff , came in . He saw me and crossed over to sit at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We sat for a long time in silence . Finally he said : " Have they gone yet ? " " I think they leave to-morrow . " " You see , the son did not die . It is as I told you  --  life is not that easy . " " I do not understand , " I said . " She is so young  --  so innocent ! " My friend sipped his tea . " So young . . . so innocent ! " he repeated . " There is no virtue in being either . " " I tried to warn her . " " And she would not listen . . . Nat-urally . " " God should not permit such things ! " I cried . " God should not permit her to make this sacrifice ! " My friend gave me a kindly look . " God permits a sacrifice always , " he answered . I sat there for a long time looking at him . . . Suddenly , I knew that he was right .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
