txt Was the Mayor addressWas It Ing himself exclusively by Way of to the champion Giants Parable ? when he said what he said on Thursday ? He called attention to the " commentators on baseball " whose early season predictions , put the New York team in the second division . Did the Giants proceed to lose heart in the face of an unsympathetic world ? They did not . " That sort of reading matter was not calculated to arouse your enthusiasm or stimulate you to great efforts , " Mr. O'BRIEN reminded the players . But the Giants did not falter even when Pelion was piled upon Ossa , when on top of a hostile body of reportorial opinion there came the Los Angeles earthquake . " The shock you received in that earthquake , I take it , you passed along to the other teams in the National League . " The newspapers employ commentators on politics as well as on baseball . They have been suggesting that Mr. O'BIUEN 's chances of carrying off the gonfalon are not brilliant . You can figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jobs says that payrolls from midand July to mid-August were $12 , - Pay . 000,000 higher than in the preceding thirty-day period , It means , of course , the weekly payroll . At that rate the indicated annual spending power of the industrial workers was higher by $625,000,000 on Aug. 15 than on July 15 . This notable increase  --  the Perkins report says it is equal to 11.6 per cent  --  is chiefly accounted for by increased employment . The average hourly wage went up a trifle less than 6 cents , but the weekly number of hours went down by more than three and a half , so that for those already employed the average weekly wage went up from $18.06 to $18.72 . This rise would perhaps account for one-fourth of the rise in the total payroll . The remainder is new jobs .

Plane construction has , of course , made rapid strides . The flying machine long ago ceased to be the fragile combination of wood sheeting and canvas which first achieved conquest of the air . Nevertheless , compared . with s its steel monster rivals on land and sea , the airplane seems so frail an object and the stresses to which it is subjected so enormous , that one reads with wonder how long a life has been granted to some of the pioneer craft of the skies .

As . for the distinction between consumption goods and capital goods , passenger automobiles against trucks and other commercial automobiles , there is nothing in the figures to show the much-discussed " saturation " in the latter field . Passenger car sales so far this year are 37 per cent higher than last year . Trucks are 42 per cent higher . The LINDBER01113 have arrived in Leningrad .
