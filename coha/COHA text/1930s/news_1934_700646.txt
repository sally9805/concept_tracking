txt The Branch Libraries . We , as library users , resent curtailment of our reading by the closing of branches and dismissal of about sixtyfive librarians . We talk and grumble , but what are we doing about it ? Let each of us write the Board of Estimate and point out why this is not true economy from the taxpayer 's standpoint . The books of those branches are still on hand , earning nothing on the money paid out for them . Payment of rent is even now going on and bringing nothing in . Certainly the Board of Education and even the Police Department are decided beneficiaries of library expenditures , if in a roundabout way . Books keep the youngsters out of mischief , and much of this recreation , amusement and entertainment  --  through reading  --  is truly educational . We owe it to the staffs . who have always had to be content with modest salaries and no pensions . Some of these dischargees have been with the system for from eight to twenty years . ECONOMY .
