txt Social Security . Homer M. Green states that ha hopes that the Supreme Court will declare the Social Security Bill unconstitutional , inasmuch as the farmer would be forced to contribute through various indirect means to its support without receiving any benefits thereof . While the farmer will be forced to contribute by various indirect means , he will receive benefits by more direct means , inasmuch as this bill was passed so that wage-earners would have more stable purchasing power . Mr. Green should realize that as a worker becomes unemployed for any length of time his purchasing power becomes impaired , and if unemployment grows to any extent it would bring about lower prices for farm commodities as it has in the past . This bill was passed with the idea of preventing another depression in the future which otherwise might be as bad if not worse than the one we are emerging from . GEORGE GOLOKOW . Brooklyn , March 2 , 1936.
