txt A year of operation of state unemployment relief in New Zealand reveals the futility of national taxation to aid the idle , for in spite of a government collected tax of 6 cents to the dollar from all workers , local committees have been forced to beg voluntary funds to meet the needs of sufferers . The unemployment insurance act , which was jammed through the legis ? lature twelve months ago , was to have removed all fear of the future for the 70,000 idle men and women . Instead of that it has proved a source of public danger , has irritated the workers still holding Jobs , has set up one more bureaucracy , and has threatened to disrupt the government Itself . Dries IVells of Public Charity . The act , the country was told , was to bo scientifically administered and all the unemployed would be spivs : thetically considered . But the first result of the new legislation was to accomplish something on which the government had not reckoned . It dried up the wells of private charity . Benevolent citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured out their unemployment tax and found that they were paying from $60 to $120 a year to aid the Idle . In addition these citizens paid a tint - tax of $5 a year . The $60 payment called an " emergency tax , " , ' . , bpt. ' . it was not easier to pay becauseAtitaL , With the ' weekly pay envelope lighter now because of the vanished bills , the workers decided that since the government was taxing them so heavily for the benefit of the unemployed it was the government 's task to keep them . Unrest Among the Idle . The next factor was the creation of unrest among the idle themselves . The government had admitted Its responsibility to care for the idle army , one which is four or five times as great as this country put into the field in the world war . The Idle , highly or ? ganized because this Is a country of joiners , determined that the government should keep its pledge . They resented the manner In which they were sent to camps in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a bid for the few jobs that were offered . They also resented the fact that they were re ? fused food and shelter if they did not enlist In the camps drafts . Mere bitterly still they resented the method of the government in granting Tens of thousands of dollars . they knew . were being collected in taxation and were being held in a fund . At once they began efforts through their organizations , to have the benefits extended . Refusal Causes Riots , It was the government 's peremptory refusal to grant greater benefits which caused the riots in Auckland and Wel lingfon . Tito administration was stall ? lng in the fear of still greater uncm ? employment In the winter just past and followed the natural path of boldin on to fends to meet the needs of addi tions to the ranks of the unemployed . This could not he explained to the Idle whose discontent was carefully played upon by a clever band of communists . and if it had been explained they two ! . ably would not have appreciated it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and demanded the right to live in a manner anproximatfrig that to which they had been ac. customed . Discontent among the idle was ac. companied by irritation in the ranks of the workers . Taxed as much CIF they could bear , with incomes cut 10 per cent by order of the state Indus ? trial commission , and tariff rates and depreciated- currency boosting livine costs , the workers met tile protests of the less fortunate with annoyance . Sympathy for Idle Vanishes . - Reminded every week of what they were contributing towards the sup ? port of tile idle they believed that this should be ample to aid tile submerged tenth of the popthLtion . Sympathy for the unemployed vanished . Willingness to ? organlie against threats . to property and intolerance of the pro tests of the Idle became marked . Dia. ' raeli 's two . nations , the , rich and . the poor , became replaced with two differ . eat racesthe idle and the employed . lyitj/in the house , of parliament the effect of - this. nationwide- tension was felt . Ministers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 1diacontent , and stirring up In WieSSnekS , Legislation was ? passed to crush- any attempt , to organize the unemployed for an effective protest against their lot . Government members , in reaction , condemned their own ministry and threatened to vote against it because of its lack of sympathy with the unemployed . A leader in this movement was R. A. Wright , Conservative front bendier and ranking member of important committees , and a former minister of education . The existence of the government was threatened within and without . One More Bureaucracy . By implication the government had promised to tackle the unemployment problem and find a way of starting new industries to absorb the idle army . Committees were appointed for this purpose , but nothing came from them . It began to look as if the position were permanent . And on top of this there was the irritant effect of the creation of one more bureaucracy  --  and one trading on the misery of men . Clerks discharged from other government de- , partments Were taken in here and given jobs on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ officers and inspectors to scrutinize claims of the idle . A great organization was created and , sensitive about the cost of operating the ' scheme , the government would ' not publish administration . costs . But the country knew what was happening and resented it , the taxpayer because this was not what he believed he should be taxed for , the idle man be ? cause he saw the offices run at the cost of himself and his family . Befere long , too , the unemployment funds were raided to build a hotel . It was an important hotel , and on a hey site in Napier , the district wrecked by We disastrous - earthquake almost two years ago , but it was still a hotel . Money Runs Out . That was not what the funds had been created for and more bitterness was aroused . Then the money began to run out . Principal cities could raise no more cash to aid their own unemployed and the state could give them no further advances . The only way was to turn back to the citizens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and state relief , having proved incompetent , city and town must appeal to the humanity of the people , to the age old warmth of fellowship and pity for those in distress . " It is bad that man in our midst should be unemployed , but it is infinitely worse and is intolerable that women and children should go hungry , " said Mayor Estop of Wellington in a recent appeal for funds . And so , dances , contests , processions and street days , the old methods of raising charity funds , return and the state scheme , which was to have taken over the responsibility , stands condemned as inefficient , Honduras Reopens Port Closed During Rebellion THGUCIGALPA , Honduras , Jan. 4. ? ( / ? )  - -  The government today issued a decree reopening the west coast port of Amapala , which has been closed on account of the rebel uprising .
