txt CHAPTER FIFTEEN * * * * * * * * * * * * * it * * * * it it * * it * Mahan Triumphant : The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt ( 1901 ? 1909 ) MAHAN 's philosophy of sea power entered the White House in the person of Theodore Roosevelt , who succeeded to the presidency in the autumn of 1901 , following the tragic death of President McKinley . In previous years , as we have repeatedly noted , foreign relations and international crises had frequently influenced naval development . Naval policy now began to influence the spirit and direction of American foreign relations . And so completely did the new President dominate both foreign relations and naval development in these opening years of the twentieth century , that the naval policy of imperial America was , in large degree , the naval policy of Theodore Roosevelt . STRATEGIC AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND Strategically speaking , the continental United States in 190 t , as in 180 , consisted of two long and exposed seaboards , as far apart as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distance by water from New York to San Francis ( u exceeded 13,000 nautical miles , more than twice as far as from San Francisco to Yokohama . It had required the first ? class battleship Oregon sixty-eight days to steam front San Francisco to Key West . It would require even longer to move // a whole fleet from one ocean to the other , and , under conceivable strategic conditions , it might prove impossible to make the transfer at all . There were two , and only two , solutions to this strategic puzzle . One was to station in each ocean a virtually independent naval force strong enough to cope with any situation likely to arise there . The other was to build an interoceanic isthmian canal which would halve the distance between our Pacific and Atlantic seaboards . The first solution had bristled with difficulties even before the war with Spain . It became utterly impracticable after the annexation of the Spanish islands in the Western Pacific , and the ensuing complication of American political relations in the Far East . Thus the only alternative was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presidency thoroughly committed to this undertaking , the initiation of which was one of the notable achievements of his Administration . Construction of an isthmian canal would solve one strategic problem but create another . As Roosevelt put it , the canal would " greatly increase the efficiency of our Navy if the Navy is of sufficient size . . . . " Otherwise , the " building of the canal would be merely giving a hostage to any power of superior strength . " 1 Or as Mahan had repeatedly pointed out during the ' nineties , an isthmian canal would be a strategic asset only if the United States Navy held indisputable command over the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific.2 The strategic position of the United States in the Caribbean , and indeed throughout the Western Atlantic north of the Equator , was naturally a strong one . After the turn of the century , this position tended to become progressively stronger , as a result of the rapid increase of the United States Navy , the growing complexity of naval technology , and , paradoxically , the rise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the twentieth century , Great Britain was the only non-American Power with a considerable naval establishment in the Western Atlantic . Germany 's threat to Great Britain 's naval supremacy in European waters soon forced the latter to cut down its oversea squadrons , including those in American waters . And the accelerating naval race with Germany , as well as the increasingly unfavorable international outlook in Europe , presently eliminated Great Britain as a possible military aggressor in the Western Hemisphere.3 The prospect of German aggression was equally remote . Germany lacked naval bases in the Western Hemisphere , and at home faced potential land enemies on two fronts . And the superior British Navy always stood between Germany and the Americas . Whatever the Kaiser and his fellow imperialists might have liked to do , there was never a time after 1900 when technical and political conditions permitted them seriously to consider the war with the United States which would inevitably have resulted from German military aggression anywhere in the Caribbean , and which probably would have followed in case of such aggression even in the more remote parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ force with respect to the other continental European Powers . In the light of all these circumstances , it would seem that American statesmen might reasonably have taken a highly optimistic view of the politico-strategic outlook in the Western Atlantic . They might even have concentrated their main fighting fleet in the Pacific where , after 1900 , it was more urgently needed than in the Atlantic . Actually , however , Roosevelt and his naval advisers took a somewhat different view . They apparently had little fear of British aggression , and the Presi- // dent to the end of his life opposed a naval race with that Power . But he regarded Germany in an altogether different light . The specter of German aggression in the Caribbean or elsewhere in Latin America , became a veritable nightmare with him . He was absolutely convinced that the Kaiser would one day start trouble somewhere in this hemisphere. ? Ignoring or belittling the all but insuperable strategic , technical , and political obstacles in the way of such aggression , Roosevelt harped on this theme until it became almost an obsession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Britain 's , he firmly believed , could forestall or resist the anticipated aggression , and insure the security of the Panama Canal. ? The naval situation in the Eastern Pacific was even more favorable to the United States . European aggression in this sector was too remote to be considered . The only conceivable source of attack was the rising Japanese Empire . And the Pacific Ocean plus the United States Navy constituted an impregnable barrier against aggression from that quarter . Even if the Japanese Navy were stronger than that of the United States , which it decidedly was not , practically insuperable difficulties would have stood in the way of a trans-Pacific assault on the continental United States . Although we have repeatedly noted the difficulties involved in waging war across the ocean , the recurrent bogey of Japanese aggression renders it highly important to leave no doubts on this point . By the beginning of the twentieth century , thanks largely to the world-wide influence of Mahan , it was recognized practically everywhere that naval operations in war , aside from sporadic raids on coast or commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confinement of the enemy 's fighting fleet , as a preliminary to commercial blockade or military invasion . A hostile fleet invading the Eastern Pa ( ill ( in force , would have to bring with it an immense train oI auxiliary vessels . These would have to carry the supplies necessary to maintain scores of naval ships of all kinds for weeks or months of continuous sea service thousands of miles front their nearest base . These supplies would necessarily include enormous quantities of fuel and ammunition ; materials and equipment for making major structural repairs ; spare parts for engines , guns , hoists , and other machinery ; medical equipment , food supplies , and the thousand other articles necessary to the maintenance of the complicated fighting machines into which men-of-war had evolved by the opening of this century . This train of auxiliary vessels would constitute a serious encumbrance , limiting the fleet 's speed , and requiring strong escort to guard it against surprise attacks by hostile cruisers . The units of the fleet would have to refuel frequently at sea , a difficult operation at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Any ship suffering serious mechanical breakdown or receiving severe injury in battle , would have to limp back to its distant dockyards , across an ocean infested with enemy raiders . To provide escorts for such ships would dangerously weaken the invading fleet . Each successive week at sea would increase the latter 's difficulties . Mechanical troubles would accumulate . The ships ' bottoms would gradually foul , with progressive loss of speed . Health and morale of officers and men would eventually suffer from the constant strain of continuous service in hostile waters . The attacking force , as already stated , could accomplish nothing strategically important until it had first destroyed or blockaded the defending fleet . The latter could always choose the time and place of battle , or refuse to fight at all . And the ability of the invaders to blockade the defending forces would depend not only upon a decisive initial superiority hu t also upon a continued efficiency impossible to maintain or , et // an extended period , thousands of miles from their nearest drydocks and machine shops . While the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have beset any trans-Pacific aggressor against the continental United States in the opening years of this century , it is sufficient to indicate the remarkable security which the United States had come to enjoy , as a result of geographical isolation , of its own naval development , and of the increasing complexities of naval technology . No one understood these facts more clearly than did Theodore Roosevelt . Yet when a crisis with Japan arose in 1907 and 1908 , he displayed astonishing alarm lest the distinctly inferior Japanese Navy launch an attack in force on our Pacific seaboard. ? The strategic problem in the Western Pacific was much more difficult . In Guam and the Philippines , the American people possessed not only exposed dependencies , but also well located sites for the advanced bases necessary to sustain the naval power essential to support the prestige and policies of the United States in the Far East.8 But these sites had yet to be developed , 9 and the government had yet to build a fighting fleet strong enough to insure their security . Until such developments had taken place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ outposts would remain negligible , and in certain conceivable war situations they might become simply gigantic liabilities.10 The peril lay chiefly in the possibility of war with Japan . The European Powers maintained squadrons in Asiatic waters // which symbolized a continuing threat to Chinese sovereignty , and hence to the Asiatic interests and policy of the United States . But these forces were comparatively weak , and were not generally regarded as a direct menace to the Philippines . With Japan the situation was different . Japanese commitments and ambitions related chiefly to Eastern Asia , and Japanese power was concentrated in Asiatic waters . Japanese ambitions , like those of the continental European Powers , collided with American interests and policies . And in case of war , Japanese strategists would logically strike first at the Philippine Islands . This situation had far-reaching implications . An American fleet , strong enough to guarantee security to the Philippines , could destroy the Japanese Navy and blockade Japan . On the other hand , a fleet that could defend the Japanese homeland against the United States , would constitute a standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movement on the part of either Power to strengthen its navy would quickly arouse anxiety in the other country . While the United States was potentially the stronger , it was not then certain that the American people would support their government to the bitter end in a naval race with Japan . Yet the recent struggle with Spain had revealed how easily the American public could be stampeded into war . As long as the American flag floated over Manila , it was axiomatic that the Navy must be prepared to defend the Philippines . But no one envisaged more clearly than Roosevelt the desperate struggle that would ensue if the United States , inadequately prepared , should have to fight Japan singlehanded in Asiatic waters.11 Thus , briefly , stood the complicated and portentous politiconaval situation that confronted Roosevelt in the Far East . He did not immediately grasp all its elements and implications . At first , he regarded Russia as the greatest menace to American interests in Asia ; but he eventually realized that the American people would not fight Russia in Manchuria , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // United States in the Philippines or anywhere else.12 Gradually , as he watched the growing antagonism of Japanese and American interests in the Far East , and the ominous development of anti-Japanese sentiment within the United States , Roosevelt transferred his anxiety to Japan , 13 launched a larger naval program , and finally , as a display of power , sent the battleship fleet into the Pacific , and on around the world . Meanwhile , the drift of events , his own temperamental preferences , and the course already charted by Secretary of State John Hay , had propelled Roosevelt , via the Far East , into the main stream of world politics , resulting in adventures which further enlarged his conception of naval adequacy . To safeguard American interests in the Far East , he followed a line calculated to foster a balance of power in general and , in particular , to play off Russia and Japan against each other.14 Since the Great Powers were all involved , any upset in Europe would inevitably produce serious repercussions in the Far East . Hence the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ equilibrium.15 And the authority of the United States , whether in Europe or in the Far East , depended , as Roosevelt saw it , on the power and reputation of the American Navy . PUBLIC OPINION AND THE NAVY : ORGANIZATION OF THE NAVY LEAGUE Public opinion , a factor at every stage in the rise of American naval power , underwent an important development early in the administration of Theodore Roosevelt . As pointed out in the foregoing chapters , large sections of the American people // had traditionally remained apathetic , indifferent , sometimes even hostile toward the Navy . On the other hand , particular groups had shown keen interest . Shipowners , exporters , producers of goods entering largely into foreign commerce , and citizens anxious to enhance the power and prestige of the United States , all had favored increasing the Navy . The same was true of shipbuilders , the metallurgical industries , and others who participated directly or indirectly in the profits of naval construction . Then there were the professional members of the Service who had a perfectly natural desire to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were the politicians , for some of whom , depending largely on the location of their constituencies , liberal naval appropriations served as a means of political advancement at the polls . The sporadic and largely uncoordinated efforts of these various groups to influence naval legislation have entered repeatedly into this study of the rise of American naval power . And , viewing them in retrospect , it now appears rather surprising that the advocates of naval expansion should have delayed so long pooling their resources in some common organization dedicated to the twofold task of educating the public and of urging their views on Congress and the President . Europe pointed the way toward such an organization . The British Navy League was founded in 1894 , the German Navy League four years later . Similar societies sprang up in Spain , Italy , and France.16 And in 1903 an American counterpart , the Navy League of the United States , came into existence . Detailed analysis of this famous association 's influence on American naval policy , would constitute a book in itself , but we may note briefly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference will be made in subsequent connections . The League was from the outset an association of individuals of diverse backgrounds and interests . It included some whose only apparent interest was the national // one of seeing the power and prestige of the United States sustained and increased . It included retired naval officers . And it also embraced prominent financiers , industrialists , and corporation lawyers , at least some of whom had a direct pecuniary interest in progressive naval expansion.17 It would be as difficult to measure the League 's direct influence on legislation as its indirect influence through popular education and propaganda . But in both spheres , it is no exaggeration to say that this influence was great.18 And the organization and growth of this association in these opening years of the century was unquestionably a factor of no small importance in the remarkable success with which President Roosevelt brought about an increase of naval power , unapproached in any previous comparable period in American history . ROOSEVELT 'S NAVAL PROGRAMS Executive leadership in naval policy took on new meaning under Roosevelt . Certain Presidents and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ framing a legislative program . More often the Executive had simply presented more or less specific recommendations , and then left Congress to take whatever action , if any , it saw fit . Now for the first time , Congress , during nearly eight years , faced a Chief Executive who combined an almost fanatical desire for a big navy , expert knowledge of naval affairs , an extraordinary flair for showmanship , and a fighting spirit that would not accept defeat . The President lost no time getting his naval program under way . In December 1901 , he sent Congress a ringing appeal // obviously intended as much for public as for congressional consumption.19 He followed this with specific demands , 20 backed by all the influence he could bring to bear on Congress . As on previous occasions , strong executive leadership plus safe partisan majorities produced results . Year after year , a determined minority , recruited from both parties , fought the President , denouncing his naval program as imperialistic , militaristic , grossly excessive , a menace to our peaceful relations , and calculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it included some of the most distinguished congressional leaders , 22 failed to stop the Administration 's drive which did not slacken until 1905 . The results of this drive were impressive . Within four years , Congress had authorized ten first-class battleships , 23 four armored cruisers , 24 and seventeen other vessels of different // classes , 25 the whole aggregating over 250,000 tons displacement . During these four years , naval appropriations had mounted from $85,000,000 to $118,000,000 per year , a record without peacetime precedent.26 And these results were even more impressive , because achieved in the face of formidable and growing opposition both inside and outside the halls of Congress.27 At this point , December 1905 , Roosevelt announced a breathing spell . Counting vessels still under construction , he estimated the effective naval strength at forty armored ships ? twenty-eight battleships and twelve armored cruisers28 ? which placed the United States second only to France and Great Britain.29 It did " not seem . . . necessary . . . at least in the immediate future , " he declared in December 1905 , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It would suffice merely to replace " worn out " or " inefficient " units , adding " probably . . . a single battleship . . . each year . " 30 Actually , the Administration never put this replacement policy fully into operation . The General Board whose conception . // of an adequate fighting fleet exceeded even Roosevelt 's , strongly opposed any slackening in the pace of naval construction.31 And the President , perhaps because of his rising anxiety over the anti-Japanese movement in California , 32 supported the Navy Department 's request for two battleships in the same message in which he announced the one-a-year replacement program.33 As Senator Lodge had warned , the latter announcement placed the President at a fatal disadvantage in making fresh demands on Congress . The opponents of further naval expansion could , and repeatedly did , cite Roosevelt as authority for the view that the Navy was now large enough . And when the latter launched a second large building program in 1907 , they immediately countered it by vociferously endorsing his former one-a-year replacement policy . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were forming for the coming struggle , with the advocates of continuous but moderate naval development holding new battleship authorizations down to one instead of two as requested by the Administration.34 Before Congress again assembled , in December 1906 , events on our Pacific Coast had plunged the United States into a grave political crisis with Japan . This crisis arose from the rising anti-Japanese agitation , especially in California , leading to boycotts and discrimination which culminated , in October 1906 , in the segregation of Oriental school children in San Francisco . An alarming situation rapidly developed , with war widely regarded as the possible outcome . Roosevelt strove conscientiously to reach a peaceful settlement , but characteristically determined to prepare for the worst . In public , he spoke The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 263 calmly of the Navy 's readiness for any eventuality . But privately , he sent warning letters to the chairmen of the House and Senate Naval Committees , which foreshadowed early abandonment of his one-a-year replacement policy.35 Such action was hastened by a revolutionary advance in naval architecture which fortuitously coincided with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the socalled " all-big-gun " battleship . The first-class battleship of the decade , 1895-1905 , carried a main battery of four large ( elevento thirteen-inch ) and a larger number of medium caliber ( eight- to nine-inch ) guns , mounted usually in pairs in revolving turrets . In December 1906 , however , the British Admiralty completed a battleship the main battery of which consisted entirely of twelve-inch guns , ten in number . This battery , together with heavier armor , greater speed , higher freeboard , and hence higher gun-platforms , gave this battleship at least twice the offensive power of any warship in existence . And the advent of this ship , named the Dreadnought , rendered immediately obsolete every capital ship afloat.36 American naval authorities had anticipated this development . They had already designed two battleships with singlecaliber main batteries . These ships , authorized in 1905 but not laid down until the following year , carried eight twelveinch guns instead of four.37 And the battleship , authorized in 1906 , following completion of the British Dreadnought , completed the American Navy 's transition to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Delaware , was the first American dreadnought . It displaced 20,000 tons , practically twice as much as the Oregon , best American battleship in 1898 . The Delaware could steam better than 21.5 knots , nearly five knots faster than the Oregon . It carried two and one-half times as many big guns , each with longer range , higher power , and . // greater accuracy . And its construction marked another stage in rise of American naval power 38 The advent of the dreadnought battleship , coming on top of the Japanese crisis , galvanized the President into action . In January 1907 , he addressed a warning to the House Naval Committee that we must build dreadnoughts or relinquish our political power and position in both oceans.33 And when the forces of conservatism in Congress once more authorized only one capital ship , 40 Roosevelt countered , the following December , with a peremptory demand for immediate construction of four all-big-gun ships.41 This demand precipitated one of the bitterest legislative struggles in American naval history . The House Naval Committee recommended only two ships.42 The President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alabama , 43 countered with a motion to restore the number to four.44 In support of this motion , it was repeated that such an increase was necessary to hold our naval rank among the Powers . It was imperative to maintain that rank , or even to forge ahead , not to support aggressive policies , for we had none ; but to compel respect for our commercial rights and interests in the Far East , to maintain the supremacy of the white race in the Pacific , to prevent violations of the Monroe . The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 265 Doctrine , to deter potential aggressors against our continental and oversea territories , and in the final analysis , to repel aggression , if necessary by war.45 In reply , advocates of the smaller program scouted the war rumors which , they asserted , were annually cooked up when the naval appropriation bill was under consideration . They flatly rejected the familiar argument that a big navy was cheap insurance against war , contending instead that naval expansion in one country fostered distrust and fear abroad , stimulating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war , or both . They also made much of our strong geographical position , stressing the all-but-insuperable strategic and technical , as well as political , obstacles which would prevent any Asiatic or European Power from carrying a war across the Pacific or Atlantic . And expressly or by implication , they stood opposed to building up a great navy for waging war overseas . " It was not to be expected that a man of Roosevelt 's temper would quietly await the outcome . Already , in December 1907 , he had made a bold and dramatic gesture , calculated both to overawe Japan and to popularize the Navy and his latest naval program . This was nothing less than sending a fleet of sixteen battleships to our Pacific Coast , where they arrived in April 1908 , when the struggle in Congress was approaching a climax . Meanwhile , he had ordered Congress to authorize his four battleships without further delay.47 He had also resurrected // the Japanese crisis , now on the way toward settlement , and exploited it behind the scenes to subdue the opposition.48 In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ local public buildings bill , " a pork-barrel measure , dear to every Congressman who must soon face his constituents in the rapidly approaching election.49 These and other maneuvers failed , however , to quell the revolt . The House voted down Hobson 's motion , 199 to 83 , without the formality of a roll call ; then adopted the committee 's two-battleship proposal ; but appropriated no funds with which to begin work on the vessels thus authorized.5o The battleground now shifted to the Senate , where a group of younger members , under the aggressive leadership of Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana , rallied behind the President . But the Senate also was completely out of hand . For seven years , Roosevelt had ridden roughshod over senatorial pride , prestige , and prerogative . He had repeatedly ignored or sidestepped the Senate 's role in foreign relations . He had pushed sundry social reforms against the wishes of Republican conservatives who dominated the Senate organization . But now his " reign " was swiftly drawing to a close ; his " big stick " no longer had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Senate conservatives took revenge all along the line.51 After a savage debate , 52 in which even Roosevelt 's ancient friendship with Senator Lodge hung precariously in the balance , 53 the Republican " Old Guard , " including a few genuine small-navy men as well as many who would normally have supported a strong The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 267 naval policy , joined with a majority of the Democrats to vote down the President 's four-battleship program.54 After thus wrecking his favorite project , the Senate relented sufficiently to sustain the two-ship authorization of the House , and to restore , under threat of veto , 65 the appropriation necessary to begin work on the new vessels.56 The political implications of this dramatic legislative struggle are by no means clear . Taking the House proceedings as a fair index of public opinion , J7 it would appear : first , that the American people as a whole were overwhelmingly opposed to the President 's naval program ; and , second , that the Middle West was the stronghold of anti-navy sentiment.68 Certain collateral evidence , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ active public opposition to the President 's program came not from the Middle West but from the Atlantic seaboard . The active groups consisted chiefly of the Society of Friends , Protestant clergymen , teachers , businessmen , and financiers.59 A conspicuous leader in the movement was Andrew Carnegie , who appealed personally to the President , 60 and whose name headed an impressive petition , // signed by hundreds of prominent New Yorkers.61 Conspicuous , also , were outspoken criticisms from a committee of the National Association of Manufacturers , 62 and from editors of leading financial journals.63 Turning to press opinion in general , one encounters still other puzzling facts . In February 1908 , the Literary Digest reported a sharp difference of opinion among the newspapers , with respect to the President 's battleship program.64 Two months later , however , a poll of editors65 and a survey of editorials revealed a press overwhelmingly supporting the President against Congress.E6 Letters and telegrams pouring in upon Congress during the struggle were said also to reflect this later drift of opinion.67 Yet , as already noted , the House on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's program by the decisive majority of 199 to 83 . Whatever inference one may draw from these contradictory indications , certain facts are clear . By demanding four , Roosevelt secured two battleships instead of one , thereby smashing the one-a-year replacement policy , which he had previously endorsed , and which his opponents were now citing against him . And this achievement set a precedent for the next congressional session ( 1908-1909 ) , in which Roosevelt , using the same strategy , secured two more capital ships in the face of even stiffer opposition . // With this final compromise , Roosevelt stepped down from the presidency . Since launching his second drive in 1907 , he had maneuvered Congress into authorizing four new capital ships , larger , more powerful , and more expensive than their predecessors.69 In the face of financial panic and industrial depression , he had forced up naval appropriations from $100 , - 900,000 in 1907 to the unprecedented peacetime figure of $140 , - 000,000 in 1909 . On the other hand , he had secured many less battleships than he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their presumed utility for coast and harbor defense , 70 the Administration had secured comparatively little besides battleships . After authorizing three scout cruisers in 1904 , Congress had ignored all subsequent recommendations for these indispensable " eyes " of a fighting fleet . The Administration had further secured only twenty destroyers , a mere fraction of the number needed for a fleet as large as that of the United States.71 And in addition to all this , and perhaps even more important , the President 's demands had aroused , strengthened , and solidified an opposition , hitherto scattered and largerly unorganized , 72 foreshadowing stormy times in case the next Administration should // undertake to carry on Roosevelt 's policy of keeping pace with the still accelerating naval race in Europe . BUILDING A FIGHTING NAVY It was one thing to persuade or coerce Congress into authorizing ships . It was another to design and build them . And it was as great a task , if a less spectacular one , to weld the ships , the officers and crews who manned them , and the supporting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded to the presidency in 1901 , the country 's warship-building facilities , both public and private , were still far from adequate . The battleship Illinois , authorized back in June 1896 , was just going into commission in September 1901 . It required nearly four and a half years on the average to build each of the ten battleships authorized between 1896 and 1900 . And many of them when completed showed defects of design which seriously impaired their fighting qualities . Their protective belt of armor extended insufficiently above the waterline . They had such low freeboard that it was impossible to work some or all of their guns in a heavy sea . A direct vertical shaft from the big-gun turrets to the ammunition-handling rooms opened the way for a powder flash in the turret to explode the magazine . The gun ports were too large to afford adequate protection for gun crews and the elaborate mechanism for handling the guns . And there were other faults too technical to mention here . When Roosevelt left the presidency , most of these defects had either been corrected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for battleships was less than two years . And a large share of the credit for these achievements belonged to the President.73 Roosevelt found the Navy 's organization and administration even more defective . Despite the teachings of Mahan and recent experience in the war with Spain , there was still no permanent The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 271 fleet in being . The capital ships in commission were widely scattered . Ships on oversea stations had to come home frequently for repairs , or else depend upon such facilities as were obtainable in foreign ports . There was an acute personnel shortage , rendering it absolutely impossible to man all the ships built and building . Yet the personnel system in force kept officers in subordinate ranks until late in their careers . Despite recent efforts to adjust the long-standing feud between the Line and engineer corps , ill-will was smoldering between these branches of the Service . Several years of timid and cautious political leadership had tightened the hold of the Navy Department bureaucracy , which now ruled with an iron hand , usually ignoring , sometimes penalizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With Congress , as in earlier years , more interested in naval spoils than in naval efficiency ; with the lay public apathetic , as ever , to the details of naval art and science ; and with cautious and conservative elderly officers dominating the Service , the need was great and the time was ripe for a thorough housecleaning . Of all men in public life at that time Roosevelt was preeminently the best equipped to wield the broom.74 In December 1901 , less than three months after taking office , he was ready with a program of reforms . These included : additional officers and seamen ; less shore duty ; more ships in commission ; a new emphasis on efficiency ; and constant training under conditions as similar as possible to those of actual warfare . " It is important , " he declared , " to have our Navy of adequate size , but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world . This is CHAPTER FIFTEEN * * * * * * * * * @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it * * it * Mahan Triumphant : The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt ( 1901 ? 1909 ) MAHAN 's philosophy of sea power entered the White House in the person of Theodore Roosevelt , who succeeded to the presidency in the autumn of 1901 , following the tragic death of President McKinley . In previous years , as we have repeatedly noted , foreign relations and international crises had frequently influenced naval development . Naval policy now began to influence the spirit and direction of American foreign relations . And so completely did the new President dominate both foreign relations and naval development in these opening years of the twentieth century , that the naval policy of imperial America was , in large degree , the naval policy of Theodore Roosevelt . STRATEGIC AND POLITICAL BACKGROUND Strategically speaking , the continental United States in 190 t , as in 180 , consisted of two long and exposed seaboards , as far apart as if situated on opposite sides of the globe . The shortest distance by water from New York to San Francis ( u exceeded 13,000 nautical miles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Yokohama . It had required the first ? class battleship Oregon sixty-eight days to steam front San Francisco to Key West . It would require even longer to move // a whole fleet from one ocean to the other , and , under conceivable strategic conditions , it might prove impossible to make the transfer at all . There were two , and only two , solutions to this strategic puzzle . One was to station in each ocean a virtually independent naval force strong enough to cope with any situation likely to arise there . The other was to build an interoceanic isthmian canal which would halve the distance between our Pacific and Atlantic seaboards . The first solution had bristled with difficulties even before the war with Spain . It became utterly impracticable after the annexation of the Spanish islands in the Western Pacific , and the ensuing complication of American political relations in the Far East . Thus the only alternative was to build a canal , and Roosevelt came to the presidency thoroughly committed to this undertaking , the initiation of which was one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canal would solve one strategic problem but create another . As Roosevelt put it , the canal would " greatly increase the efficiency of our Navy if the Navy is of sufficient size . . . . " Otherwise , the " building of the canal would be merely giving a hostage to any power of superior strength . " 1 Or as Mahan had repeatedly pointed out during the ' nineties , an isthmian canal would be a strategic asset only if the United States Navy held indisputable command over the Caribbean and the Eastern Pacific.2 The strategic position of the United States in the Caribbean , and indeed throughout the Western Atlantic north of the Equator , was naturally a strong one . After the turn of the century , this position tended to become progressively stronger , as a result of the rapid increase of the United States Navy , the growing complexity of naval technology , and , paradoxically , the rise of German naval power . // At the beginning of the twentieth century , Great Britain was the only non-American Power with a considerable naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Great Britain 's naval supremacy in European waters soon forced the latter to cut down its oversea squadrons , including those in American waters . And the accelerating naval race with Germany , as well as the increasingly unfavorable international outlook in Europe , presently eliminated Great Britain as a possible military aggressor in the Western Hemisphere.3 The prospect of German aggression was equally remote . Germany lacked naval bases in the Western Hemisphere , and at home faced potential land enemies on two fronts . And the superior British Navy always stood between Germany and the Americas . Whatever the Kaiser and his fellow imperialists might have liked to do , there was never a time after 1900 when technical and political conditions permitted them seriously to consider the war with the United States which would inevitably have resulted from German military aggression anywhere in the Caribbean , and which probably would have followed in case of such aggression even in the more remote parts of South America.4 And this conclusion applied with even greater force with respect to the other continental European Powers . In the light of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reasonably have taken a highly optimistic view of the politico-strategic outlook in the Western Atlantic . They might even have concentrated their main fighting fleet in the Pacific where , after 1900 , it was more urgently needed than in the Atlantic . Actually , however , Roosevelt and his naval advisers took a somewhat different view . They apparently had little fear of British aggression , and the Presi- // dent to the end of his life opposed a naval race with that Power . But he regarded Germany in an altogether different light . The specter of German aggression in the Caribbean or elsewhere in Latin America , became a veritable nightmare with him . He was absolutely convinced that the Kaiser would one day start trouble somewhere in this hemisphere. ? Ignoring or belittling the all but insuperable strategic , technical , and political obstacles in the way of such aggression , Roosevelt harped on this theme until it became almost an obsession . Only a fighting fleet , second to none save Britain 's , he firmly believed , could forestall or resist the anticipated aggression , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naval situation in the Eastern Pacific was even more favorable to the United States . European aggression in this sector was too remote to be considered . The only conceivable source of attack was the rising Japanese Empire . And the Pacific Ocean plus the United States Navy constituted an impregnable barrier against aggression from that quarter . Even if the Japanese Navy were stronger than that of the United States , which it decidedly was not , practically insuperable difficulties would have stood in the way of a trans-Pacific assault on the continental United States . Although we have repeatedly noted the difficulties involved in waging war across the ocean , the recurrent bogey of Japanese aggression renders it highly important to leave no doubts on this point . By the beginning of the twentieth century , thanks largely to the world-wide influence of Mahan , it was recognized practically everywhere that naval operations in war , aside from sporadic raids on coast or commerce , had only one // major objective : destruction or confinement of the enemy 's fighting fleet , as a preliminary to commercial blockade or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( ill ( in force , would have to bring with it an immense train oI auxiliary vessels . These would have to carry the supplies necessary to maintain scores of naval ships of all kinds for weeks or months of continuous sea service thousands of miles front their nearest base . These supplies would necessarily include enormous quantities of fuel and ammunition ; materials and equipment for making major structural repairs ; spare parts for engines , guns , hoists , and other machinery ; medical equipment , food supplies , and the thousand other articles necessary to the maintenance of the complicated fighting machines into which men-of-war had evolved by the opening of this century . This train of auxiliary vessels would constitute a serious encumbrance , limiting the fleet 's speed , and requiring strong escort to guard it against surprise attacks by hostile cruisers . The units of the fleet would have to refuel frequently at sea , a difficult operation at best , and one of extreme hazard in hostile waters . Any ship suffering serious mechanical breakdown or receiving severe injury in battle , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an ocean infested with enemy raiders . To provide escorts for such ships would dangerously weaken the invading fleet . Each successive week at sea would increase the latter 's difficulties . Mechanical troubles would accumulate . The ships ' bottoms would gradually foul , with progressive loss of speed . Health and morale of officers and men would eventually suffer from the constant strain of continuous service in hostile waters . The attacking force , as already stated , could accomplish nothing strategically important until it had first destroyed or blockaded the defending fleet . The latter could always choose the time and place of battle , or refuse to fight at all . And the ability of the invaders to blockade the defending forces would depend not only upon a decisive initial superiority hu t also upon a continued efficiency impossible to maintain or , et // an extended period , thousands of miles from their nearest drydocks and machine shops . While the foregoing summary by no means exhausts the difficulties which would have beset any trans-Pacific aggressor against the continental United States in the opening years of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ security which the United States had come to enjoy , as a result of geographical isolation , of its own naval development , and of the increasing complexities of naval technology . No one understood these facts more clearly than did Theodore Roosevelt . Yet when a crisis with Japan arose in 1907 and 1908 , he displayed astonishing alarm lest the distinctly inferior Japanese Navy launch an attack in force on our Pacific seaboard. ? The strategic problem in the Western Pacific was much more difficult . In Guam and the Philippines , the American people possessed not only exposed dependencies , but also well located sites for the advanced bases necessary to sustain the naval power essential to support the prestige and policies of the United States in the Far East.8 But these sites had yet to be developed , 9 and the government had yet to build a fighting fleet strong enough to insure their security . Until such developments had taken place ashore and afloat , the strategic value of these insular outposts would remain negligible , and in certain conceivable war situations they might become simply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war with Japan . The European Powers maintained squadrons in Asiatic waters // which symbolized a continuing threat to Chinese sovereignty , and hence to the Asiatic interests and policy of the United States . But these forces were comparatively weak , and were not generally regarded as a direct menace to the Philippines . With Japan the situation was different . Japanese commitments and ambitions related chiefly to Eastern Asia , and Japanese power was concentrated in Asiatic waters . Japanese ambitions , like those of the continental European Powers , collided with American interests and policies . And in case of war , Japanese strategists would logically strike first at the Philippine Islands . This situation had far-reaching implications . An American fleet , strong enough to guarantee security to the Philippines , could destroy the Japanese Navy and blockade Japan . On the other hand , a fleet that could defend the Japanese homeland against the United States , would constitute a standing menace to the security of the Philippines . Any aggressive movement on the part of either Power to strengthen its navy would quickly arouse anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ potentially the stronger , it was not then certain that the American people would support their government to the bitter end in a naval race with Japan . Yet the recent struggle with Spain had revealed how easily the American public could be stampeded into war . As long as the American flag floated over Manila , it was axiomatic that the Navy must be prepared to defend the Philippines . But no one envisaged more clearly than Roosevelt the desperate struggle that would ensue if the United States , inadequately prepared , should have to fight Japan singlehanded in Asiatic waters.11 Thus , briefly , stood the complicated and portentous politiconaval situation that confronted Roosevelt in the Far East . He did not immediately grasp all its elements and implications . At first , he regarded Russia as the greatest menace to American interests in Asia ; but he eventually realized that the American people would not fight Russia in Manchuria , and that the Russians , whatever their inclinations , could not attack the // United States in the Philippines or anywhere else.12 Gradually , as he watched the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ East , and the ominous development of anti-Japanese sentiment within the United States , Roosevelt transferred his anxiety to Japan , 13 launched a larger naval program , and finally , as a display of power , sent the battleship fleet into the Pacific , and on around the world . Meanwhile , the drift of events , his own temperamental preferences , and the course already charted by Secretary of State John Hay , had propelled Roosevelt , via the Far East , into the main stream of world politics , resulting in adventures which further enlarged his conception of naval adequacy . To safeguard American interests in the Far East , he followed a line calculated to foster a balance of power in general and , in particular , to play off Russia and Japan against each other.14 Since the Great Powers were all involved , any upset in Europe would inevitably produce serious repercussions in the Far East . Hence the United States had a vital if indirect interest in the shaky European equilibrium.15 And the authority of the United States , whether in Europe or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the power and reputation of the American Navy . PUBLIC OPINION AND THE NAVY : ORGANIZATION OF THE NAVY LEAGUE Public opinion , a factor at every stage in the rise of American naval power , underwent an important development early in the administration of Theodore Roosevelt . As pointed out in the foregoing chapters , large sections of the American people // had traditionally remained apathetic , indifferent , sometimes even hostile toward the Navy . On the other hand , particular groups had shown keen interest . Shipowners , exporters , producers of goods entering largely into foreign commerce , and citizens anxious to enhance the power and prestige of the United States , all had favored increasing the Navy . The same was true of shipbuilders , the metallurgical industries , and others who participated directly or indirectly in the profits of naval construction . Then there were the professional members of the Service who had a perfectly natural desire to see their institution grow and prosper . And finally , there were the politicians , for some of whom , depending largely on the location of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of political advancement at the polls . The sporadic and largely uncoordinated efforts of these various groups to influence naval legislation have entered repeatedly into this study of the rise of American naval power . And , viewing them in retrospect , it now appears rather surprising that the advocates of naval expansion should have delayed so long pooling their resources in some common organization dedicated to the twofold task of educating the public and of urging their views on Congress and the President . Europe pointed the way toward such an organization . The British Navy League was founded in 1894 , the German Navy League four years later . Similar societies sprang up in Spain , Italy , and France.16 And in 1903 an American counterpart , the Navy League of the United States , came into existence . Detailed analysis of this famous association 's influence on American naval policy , would constitute a book in itself , but we may note briefly certain features of its composition and activities to which further reference will be made in subsequent connections . The League was from the outset an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included some whose only apparent interest was the national // one of seeing the power and prestige of the United States sustained and increased . It included retired naval officers . And it also embraced prominent financiers , industrialists , and corporation lawyers , at least some of whom had a direct pecuniary interest in progressive naval expansion.17 It would be as difficult to measure the League 's direct influence on legislation as its indirect influence through popular education and propaganda . But in both spheres , it is no exaggeration to say that this influence was great.18 And the organization and growth of this association in these opening years of the century was unquestionably a factor of no small importance in the remarkable success with which President Roosevelt brought about an increase of naval power , unapproached in any previous comparable period in American history . ROOSEVELT 'S NAVAL PROGRAMS Executive leadership in naval policy took on new meaning under Roosevelt . Certain Presidents and Secretaries of the Navy had displayed energy and initiative in framing a legislative program . More often the Executive had simply presented more or less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , if any , it saw fit . Now for the first time , Congress , during nearly eight years , faced a Chief Executive who combined an almost fanatical desire for a big navy , expert knowledge of naval affairs , an extraordinary flair for showmanship , and a fighting spirit that would not accept defeat . The President lost no time getting his naval program under way . In December 1901 , he sent Congress a ringing appeal // obviously intended as much for public as for congressional consumption.19 He followed this with specific demands , 20 backed by all the influence he could bring to bear on Congress . As on previous occasions , strong executive leadership plus safe partisan majorities produced results . Year after year , a determined minority , recruited from both parties , fought the President , denouncing his naval program as imperialistic , militaristic , grossly excessive , a menace to our peaceful relations , and calculated to impoverish the country.21 But this opposition , even though it included some of the most distinguished congressional leaders , 22 failed to stop the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The results of this drive were impressive . Within four years , Congress had authorized ten first-class battleships , 23 four armored cruisers , 24 and seventeen other vessels of different // classes , 25 the whole aggregating over 250,000 tons displacement . During these four years , naval appropriations had mounted from $85,000,000 to $118,000,000 per year , a record without peacetime precedent.26 And these results were even more impressive , because achieved in the face of formidable and growing opposition both inside and outside the halls of Congress.27 At this point , December 1905 , Roosevelt announced a breathing spell . Counting vessels still under construction , he estimated the effective naval strength at forty armored ships ? twenty-eight battleships and twelve armored cruisers28 ? which placed the United States second only to France and Great Britain.29 It did " not seem . . . necessary . . . at least in the immediate future , " he declared in December 1905 , to increase the fleet " beyond the present number of units . " It would suffice merely to replace " worn out " or " inefficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single battleship . . . each year . " 30 Actually , the Administration never put this replacement policy fully into operation . The General Board whose conception . // of an adequate fighting fleet exceeded even Roosevelt 's , strongly opposed any slackening in the pace of naval construction.31 And the President , perhaps because of his rising anxiety over the anti-Japanese movement in California , 32 supported the Navy Department 's request for two battleships in the same message in which he announced the one-a-year replacement program.33 As Senator Lodge had warned , the latter announcement placed the President at a fatal disadvantage in making fresh demands on Congress . The opponents of further naval expansion could , and repeatedly did , cite Roosevelt as authority for the view that the Navy was now large enough . And when the latter launched a second large building program in 1907 , they immediately countered it by vociferously endorsing his former one-a-year replacement policy . Meanwhile , in the congressional session of 1905-1906 , the lines were forming for the coming struggle , with the advocates of continuous but moderate naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two as requested by the Administration.34 Before Congress again assembled , in December 1906 , events on our Pacific Coast had plunged the United States into a grave political crisis with Japan . This crisis arose from the rising anti-Japanese agitation , especially in California , leading to boycotts and discrimination which culminated , in October 1906 , in the segregation of Oriental school children in San Francisco . An alarming situation rapidly developed , with war widely regarded as the possible outcome . Roosevelt strove conscientiously to reach a peaceful settlement , but characteristically determined to prepare for the worst . In public , he spoke The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 263 calmly of the Navy 's readiness for any eventuality . But privately , he sent warning letters to the chairmen of the House and Senate Naval Committees , which foreshadowed early abandonment of his one-a-year replacement policy.35 Such action was hastened by a revolutionary advance in naval architecture which fortuitously coincided with the Japanese crisis . This advance was the development of the socalled " all-big-gun " battleship . The first-class battleship of the decade , 1895-1905 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thirteen-inch ) and a larger number of medium caliber ( eight- to nine-inch ) guns , mounted usually in pairs in revolving turrets . In December 1906 , however , the British Admiralty completed a battleship the main battery of which consisted entirely of twelve-inch guns , ten in number . This battery , together with heavier armor , greater speed , higher freeboard , and hence higher gun-platforms , gave this battleship at least twice the offensive power of any warship in existence . And the advent of this ship , named the Dreadnought , rendered immediately obsolete every capital ship afloat.36 American naval authorities had anticipated this development . They had already designed two battleships with singlecaliber main batteries . These ships , authorized in 1905 but not laid down until the following year , carried eight twelveinch guns instead of four.37 And the battleship , authorized in 1906 , following completion of the British Dreadnought , completed the American Navy 's transition to the new standard of capital-ship power . This ship , the Delaware , was the first American dreadnought . It displaced 20,000 tons , practically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1898 . The Delaware could steam better than 21.5 knots , nearly five knots faster than the Oregon . It carried two and one-half times as many big guns , each with longer range , higher power , and . // greater accuracy . And its construction marked another stage in rise of American naval power 38 The advent of the dreadnought battleship , coming on top of the Japanese crisis , galvanized the President into action . In January 1907 , he addressed a warning to the House Naval Committee that we must build dreadnoughts or relinquish our political power and position in both oceans.33 And when the forces of conservatism in Congress once more authorized only one capital ship , 40 Roosevelt countered , the following December , with a peremptory demand for immediate construction of four all-big-gun ships.41 This demand precipitated one of the bitterest legislative struggles in American naval history . The House Naval Committee recommended only two ships.42 The President 's supporters , led by Representative Richmond P. Hobson of Alabama , 43 countered with a motion to restore the number to four.44 In support @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase was necessary to hold our naval rank among the Powers . It was imperative to maintain that rank , or even to forge ahead , not to support aggressive policies , for we had none ; but to compel respect for our commercial rights and interests in the Far East , to maintain the supremacy of the white race in the Pacific , to prevent violations of the Monroe . The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 265 Doctrine , to deter potential aggressors against our continental and oversea territories , and in the final analysis , to repel aggression , if necessary by war.45 In reply , advocates of the smaller program scouted the war rumors which , they asserted , were annually cooked up when the naval appropriation bill was under consideration . They flatly rejected the familiar argument that a big navy was cheap insurance against war , contending instead that naval expansion in one country fostered distrust and fear abroad , stimulating armament competition that could end only in national bankruptcy or war , or both . They also made much of our strong geographical position , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political , obstacles which would prevent any Asiatic or European Power from carrying a war across the Pacific or Atlantic . And expressly or by implication , they stood opposed to building up a great navy for waging war overseas . " It was not to be expected that a man of Roosevelt 's temper would quietly await the outcome . Already , in December 1907 , he had made a bold and dramatic gesture , calculated both to overawe Japan and to popularize the Navy and his latest naval program . This was nothing less than sending a fleet of sixteen battleships to our Pacific Coast , where they arrived in April 1908 , when the struggle in Congress was approaching a climax . Meanwhile , he had ordered Congress to authorize his four battleships without further delay.47 He had also resurrected // the Japanese crisis , now on the way toward settlement , and exploited it behind the scenes to subdue the opposition.48 In desperation , he even threatened to veto a special " local public buildings bill , " a pork-barrel measure , dear to every Congressman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These and other maneuvers failed , however , to quell the revolt . The House voted down Hobson 's motion , 199 to 83 , without the formality of a roll call ; then adopted the committee 's two-battleship proposal ; but appropriated no funds with which to begin work on the vessels thus authorized.5o The battleground now shifted to the Senate , where a group of younger members , under the aggressive leadership of Albert J. Beveridge of Indiana , rallied behind the President . But the Senate also was completely out of hand . For seven years , Roosevelt had ridden roughshod over senatorial pride , prestige , and prerogative . He had repeatedly ignored or sidestepped the Senate 's role in foreign relations . He had pushed sundry social reforms against the wishes of Republican conservatives who dominated the Senate organization . But now his " reign " was swiftly drawing to a close ; his " big stick " no longer had its old-time efficacy . As power slipped from his grasp , the Senate conservatives took revenge all along the line.51 After a savage debate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lodge hung precariously in the balance , 53 the Republican " Old Guard , " including a few genuine small-navy men as well as many who would normally have supported a strong The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 267 naval policy , joined with a majority of the Democrats to vote down the President 's four-battleship program.54 After thus wrecking his favorite project , the Senate relented sufficiently to sustain the two-ship authorization of the House , and to restore , under threat of veto , 65 the appropriation necessary to begin work on the new vessels.56 The political implications of this dramatic legislative struggle are by no means clear . Taking the House proceedings as a fair index of public opinion , J7 it would appear : first , that the American people as a whole were overwhelmingly opposed to the President 's naval program ; and , second , that the Middle West was the stronghold of anti-navy sentiment.68 Certain collateral evidence , however , throws some doubt upon these conclusions . Practically all active public opposition to the President 's program came not from the Middle West but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Society of Friends , Protestant clergymen , teachers , businessmen , and financiers.59 A conspicuous leader in the movement was Andrew Carnegie , who appealed personally to the President , 60 and whose name headed an impressive petition , // signed by hundreds of prominent New Yorkers.61 Conspicuous , also , were outspoken criticisms from a committee of the National Association of Manufacturers , 62 and from editors of leading financial journals.63 Turning to press opinion in general , one encounters still other puzzling facts . In February 1908 , the Literary Digest reported a sharp difference of opinion among the newspapers , with respect to the President 's battleship program.64 Two months later , however , a poll of editors65 and a survey of editorials revealed a press overwhelmingly supporting the President against Congress.E6 Letters and telegrams pouring in upon Congress during the struggle were said also to reflect this later drift of opinion.67 Yet , as already noted , the House on the eve of a general election voted down the President 's program by the decisive majority of 199 to 83 . Whatever inference one may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . By demanding four , Roosevelt secured two battleships instead of one , thereby smashing the one-a-year replacement policy , which he had previously endorsed , and which his opponents were now citing against him . And this achievement set a precedent for the next congressional session ( 1908-1909 ) , in which Roosevelt , using the same strategy , secured two more capital ships in the face of even stiffer opposition.68 // With this final compromise , Roosevelt stepped down from the presidency . Since launching his second drive in 1907 , he had maneuvered Congress into authorizing four new capital ships , larger , more powerful , and more expensive than their predecessors.69 In the face of financial panic and industrial depression , he had forced up naval appropriations from $100 , - 900,000 in 1907 to the unprecedented peacetime figure of $140 , - 000,000 in 1909 . On the other hand , he had secured many less battleships than he had demanded . Except for submarines which Congressmen especially favored because of their presumed utility for coast and harbor defense , 70 the Administration had secured comparatively @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1904 , Congress had ignored all subsequent recommendations for these indispensable " eyes " of a fighting fleet . The Administration had further secured only twenty destroyers , a mere fraction of the number needed for a fleet as large as that of the United States.71 And in addition to all this , and perhaps even more important , the President 's demands had aroused , strengthened , and solidified an opposition , hitherto scattered and largerly unorganized , 72 foreshadowing stormy times in case the next Administration should // undertake to carry on Roosevelt 's policy of keeping pace with the still accelerating naval race in Europe . BUILDING A FIGHTING NAVY It was one thing to persuade or coerce Congress into authorizing ships . It was another to design and build them . And it was as great a task , if a less spectacular one , to weld the ships , the officers and crews who manned them , and the supporting shore organization into an efficient fighting machine . When Roosevelt succeeded to the presidency in 1901 , the country 's warship-building facilities , both public and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois , authorized back in June 1896 , was just going into commission in September 1901 . It required nearly four and a half years on the average to build each of the ten battleships authorized between 1896 and 1900 . And many of them when completed showed defects of design which seriously impaired their fighting qualities . Their protective belt of armor extended insufficiently above the waterline . They had such low freeboard that it was impossible to work some or all of their guns in a heavy sea . A direct vertical shaft from the big-gun turrets to the ammunition-handling rooms opened the way for a powder flash in the turret to explode the magazine . The gun ports were too large to afford adequate protection for gun crews and the elaborate mechanism for handling the guns . And there were other faults too technical to mention here . When Roosevelt left the presidency , most of these defects had either been corrected or were in process of correction . The building time for battleships was less than two years . And a large share of the credit for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's organization and administration even more defective . Despite the teachings of Mahan and recent experience in the war with Spain , there was still no permanent The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 271 fleet in being . The capital ships in commission were widely scattered . Ships on oversea stations had to come home frequently for repairs , or else depend upon such facilities as were obtainable in foreign ports . There was an acute personnel shortage , rendering it absolutely impossible to man all the ships built and building . Yet the personnel system in force kept officers in subordinate ranks until late in their careers . Despite recent efforts to adjust the long-standing feud between the Line and engineer corps , ill-will was smoldering between these branches of the Service . Several years of timid and cautious political leadership had tightened the hold of the Navy Department bureaucracy , which now ruled with an iron hand , usually ignoring , sometimes penalizing , those who attempted to introduce reforms and innovations . With Congress , as in earlier years , more interested in naval spoils than in naval @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to the details of naval art and science ; and with cautious and conservative elderly officers dominating the Service , the need was great and the time was ripe for a thorough housecleaning . Of all men in public life at that time Roosevelt was preeminently the best equipped to wield the broom.74 In December 1901 , less than three months after taking office , he was ready with a program of reforms . These included : additional officers and seamen ; less shore duty ; more ships in commission ; a new emphasis on efficiency ; and constant training under conditions as similar as possible to those of actual warfare . " It is important , " he declared , " to have our Navy of adequate size , but it is even more important that ship for ship it should equal in efficiency any navy in the world . This is // possible only with highly drilled crews and officers , and this in turn imperatively demands continuous and progressive instruction in target practice , ship handling , squadron tactics , and general discipline . " 75 The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was imperative , in Roosevelt 's eyes , to provide officers and crews for all the ships , and then to keep them in commission . Modern warships were complicated mechanisms , formidable when manned by trained personnel , but utterly useless in inexperienced hands.77 Yet the United States , he declared publicly in 1902 , was facing an alarming shortage of enlisted personnel , and had less than half enough officers to man properly the ships already built and under construction.78 Year after year he pressed these facts on Congress79 which grumbled but responded after a fashion.80 The Navy 's enlisted strength was stepped up from 25,050 in 1901 , to 44,500 in 1909.81 By increasing admissions to the Naval Academy , and raising the quotas for certain ranks , the " active list " of officers was boosted from 883 to 1,096 in the same interval.82 But the stringency still continued . The enlisted strength fell short of that authorized by law.83 And the slight increase in officer personnel failed to keep abreast of the rapidly accelerating pace of naval construction . As a result , by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second only to Great Britain in first-class capital ships , and third in tonnage built and building , had less than one-third as many line officers as Great // Britain , and about half as many as Germany , France , and Japan respectively.S4 The personnel shortage bore directly on the problem of efficiency . With officers and crews overworked , training and discipline inevitably suffered . Yet the fighting power of the Navy depended no more on the excellence of the ships than on the knowledge , skill , and efficiency of the men who handled them and worked the guns.85 The gunnery problem was especially acute when Roosevelt took office . Naval gunnery in the preceding century had occasionally risen to an art , but never to a science . The development of rifle ordnance of great range , power , and potential accuracy , opened the way for a revolution in gunnery . But this revolution hung fire . The Navy Department , it is recalled , had long remained indifferent to precision instruments for rangefinding , gun-sighting , and gun-pointing.86 Though the Spanish War had fully exposed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorities complacently ignored the deficiency . Target practice , traditionally unpopular , was left largely to the discretion of commanding officers on the different stations . And the primitive gunnery and target-practice methods still in vogue effectually blocked any real progress.87 Here and there , individual officers , mostly younger men of subordinate rank , were struggling with the gunnery problem . One of them in particular , Lieutenant ( later Admiral ) William S. Sims , had worked out improved techniques both for aiming and firing the guns , and for conducting target practice.88 When Roosevelt entered office , Sims was vainly strug- // gling to get a hearing at the Navy Department . Finally , at the risk of his future career , he carried the issue straight to the President . The latter , with the forthrightness which characterized so many of his acts , ordered the new system tried , appointed Sims inspector of target practice , and started a noisy crusade to enlighten the Navy , Congress , and the public as to the vital importance of efficient gunnery.89 And so remarkable were the results that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Navy 's shooting had already improved fully ioo per cent.90 Roosevelt was less successful in his attempt to reorganize the Navy Department . Since 1842 , the Department had been divided into administrative divisions or bureaus . One bureau had jurisdiction over hulls , another over machinery , another over ordnance , another over navy yards , another over personnel , etc . Each bureau chief was responsible only to the Secretary of the Navy , who was thus the sole coordinator and supervisor of the work of the Department as a whole . Yet the Secretary , invariably a civilian , rarely , if ever , possessed sufficient technical knowledge to perform this function well . As a result , there was waste , duplication , and conflict of jurisdiction . Precedent and routine dominated the Department . Complaints multiplied . Yet the Secretary could usually do little more than refer these to the bureau whose work was under fire . And no bureau staff , with personal reputations and even positions at stake , could afford to admit blunders the rectification of which might cost thousands or millions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advocated a // permanent board of line officers , to constitute a general staff . It was urged that such a body should centralize the functions performed by the Naval War College , the Naval Intelligence Office , and the General Board . In addition , it should have broad powers over the bureaus , and advise the Secretary of the Navy on all matters pertaining to policy and administration.92 While this plan had much to commend it , especially on purely military grounds , and while a similar organization was instituted in the Army during this period , the movement for a Navy general staff made little headway outside the Service . Congress was absolutely opposed from fear that such a body would reduce the Secretary of the Navy to a mere figurehead , and even usurp the policy-determining function of Congress , a function which included the prerogative of the national legislature to exploit the Navy for the mutual benefit of favored districts and electioneering politicians.93 Roosevelt , however , with preparedness for war uppermost in his mind , had championed the general staff idea from the beginning of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but failed to secure any action.95 Then in 1908 the issue suddenly came to a head as a result of sensational charges against the Navy Department . The burden of these charges was that the departmental bureaus were responsible for numerous grave defects in the design of American battleships , and that they had perpetuated these defects , to the jeopardy of the sea-going personnel despite repeated complaints from the officers who actually handled the ships.96 It subsequently appeared that Sims . now naval aide to the // President , was one of the instigators of this attack97 which rocked the Department , produced an explosion in the press , and led to a full-dress congressional investigation.98 And it now appears that Roosevelt was a sympathetic observer , if not actually a conspirator , in this melodrama which set the stage for another drive to create a naval general staff.99 This drive , however , was as unsuccessful as those that had gone before , and it could hardly have been otherwise , considering the temper of Congress and the President 's unhappy relations with that body during his final @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efforts to develop a system of oversea naval stations . In 1901 , and again in 1902 , the Navy Department raised the question , 10 ' but Congress , while pouring millions into navy yards within the States , ignored the pressing need for well-equipped stations overseas.102 In 1903 , the Administration took a stronger position . The United States , declared the Secretary of the Navy , had a " large fleet " in " Asiatic waters , " but " no naval base . . . nearer than Puget Sound or San Francisco Bay . " This fleet was having to depend upon " dockyards at Hongkong and in Japan , " and to transport its " stores and supplies " across the Pacific . In case of war ; under existing conditions , it would be impossible to repair and extremely difficult to supply a fleet in the Western Pacific . " Without a sufficient naval base of our own in Asiatic waters , the position of our fleet would be untenable . " 1o3 The The Naval Policy of Theodore Roosevelt 277 President backed up this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but with little effect . Congress authorized slightly larger expenditures on the oversea stations , but failed to go into the matter in a large way , and continued to vote millions for unneeded navy yards in the States.105 The explanation was obvious . Political strategy , not naval strategy , dominated the navy-yard policy of Congress . The House and Senate naval committees were invariably loaded with members from seaboard constituencies in which navy yards or stations were located . These seaboard committeemen annually combined to support their respective claims on the public treasury . Partisan differences were forgotten in this conspiracy for political plunder . And through the devious methods of bargaining and trading , which are the essence of the legislative process in the American governmental system , the claims of the seaboard were usually sustained upon the floor of House and Senate.1o6 Not so fortunate were the oversea stations . They had no Senators and Representatives to press their respective claims , or congressional votes with which to bargain for appropriations.107 Congressmen were more interested in immediate benefits at home than in prospective national advantages overseas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or nothing , on the ground that experts could not agree as to the best location for permanent naval bases in the West Indies and the Pacific.108 And in the end Roosevelt left the presidency with this problem still hanging in the air . His efforts to organize a permanent fighting fleet met with greater success . When Roosevelt took office , the United States had nine armored ships in active service : three in the North Atlantic Squadron , one fitting out for the European Station , // three in Asiatic waters , and two in the Eastern Pacific , one of which was soon to leave for the South Atlantic Station.109 The effect of this dispersion of armored ships was to destroy even a semblance of strategic unity , and to frustrate all efforts to organize a permanent fighting fleet.11 ? Roosevelt promptly took steps to remedy this situation which violated the first canon of sound strategy . Working in cooperation with a group of forward-looking naval officers , he had all battleships withdrawn from the European and South Atlantic Stations . Next , these stations were abolished , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Atlantic Squadron , which now became the Atlantic Fleet . The Asiatic Squadron was strengthened and renamed the Asiatic Fleet . Next , all battleships were withdrawn from the Pacific , and , in their place , the Asiatic Fleet was supplied with a homogeneous group of heavy armored cruisers . And finally , all forces in the Pacific were placed under one organization which was named the Pacific Fleet . Thus , by the end of 1907 , the United States had two great fighting units ? the Atlantic Fleet of sixteen battleships , and the Pacific Fleet of eight armored cruisers and an equal number of lighter cruisers.m Roosevelt accompanied this concentration of power with an educational drive , designed to eradicate the ignorance and lingering prejudices , which , despite Mahan 's widely publicized writings in the ' nineties , and experience in the war with Spain , still infected American public opinion.112 As he neared the end of his second term , this matter weighed more and more heavily upon him . Demands from the West Coast that the battleships be divided between the Atlantic and Pacific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , an eloquent public appeal for a united fighting fleet . The Navy 's true function , he reiterated , was not " to defend harbors and sea-coast cities , " but to attack and destroy the enemy 's naval forces . In this way , a battle fleet would contribute vitally , if indirectly , to coast defense . In the future as in the past , every crisis was sure to bring forth a " demand , under pressure , of fright , " to divide and scatter the Navy 's capital ships along the coast , under the mistaken notion that such a dispersion of our forces would best insure security to our coast cities . " Under penalty of terrible disaster , this demand must be refused . . . the ships . . . kept together , and their objective made the enemies ' fleet . " 113 No one understood better than Roosevelt the utter impossibility of improvising an efficient fleet in an emergency . Just as it took years to build battleships , and to train officers and crews to handle them , years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting unit . Success in the latter undertaking depended upon keeping the battleships under a single command , and bringing them together frequently for drills , exercises , and more extended maneuvers . Roosevelt 's final " legacy " to his chosen successor , was a solemn warning , never to " divide the battleship fleet between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans prior to the finishing of the Panama Canal . " 114 Roosevelt 's crowning achievement was the World Cruise of the Atlantic Fleet . We have previously alluded to the political motives behind this undertaking . Its execution had a significance exceeding even the President 's expectations . The Fleet 's visit to Japan helped liquidate the crisis that had brought the two countries to the verge of war . The cruise revealed an unsuspected community of feeling among the English-speaking peoples , and greatly enhanced American naval prestige through- 28o The Rise of American Naval Power out the world . This globe-encircling parade splendidly publicized the Navy , and tremendously increased its popularity at home . But that was not all . This undertaking dramatized , as could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forces , as well as of the privately owned American merchant marine , for transporting fuel and supplies for a large fleet operating overseas . Furthermore , this cruise of an organized fleet , steaming thousands of miles in formation , with constant attention to mechanical and tactical efficiency , provided invaluable training and experience for the officers and crews of the sixteen battleships . The Fleet left Hampton Roads in December 1907 , an aggregation of tolerably efficient individual ships ; it returned to the same anchorage late in February 1909 , a veteran unit of power , a monument to the leadership of a President who had momentarily lifted the American people out of their traditional isolationism and , in the face of stubborn and growing opposition , had led them with pomp and circumstance into the main stream of world politics.115 But the President 's term was almost over . Within a fortnight , he would have to relinquish the reins once and for all . And the question might well have occurred to him , as he watched the homecoming ships pass in review , whether his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ role that he had created . CHAPTER SIXTEEN Rooseveltian Policy Without Roosevelt 1909 ? 1913 NAVAL IMPLICATIONS OF TAFT 'S FOREIGN POLICY THE Presidency of William Howard Taft ( 1909 ? 1913 ) spanned a critical period in the world 's history . In that period , the international struggle in the Far East revealed more fully its sinister potentialities . In that period also , feverish preparation for war , as well as successive diplomatic crises , both reflected and further aggravated the growing tension and chronic sense of insecurity that pervaded the Old World . And in that period , the United States government , although taking a more aggressive part in the Far Eastern struggle , once more sought security for America and Americans , in the ancient tradition of political isolation which had been partially abandoned under McKinley and Roosevelt . There was no mistaking the isolationist drift of Taft 's foreign policy . An indiscreet utterance by Captain ( later Admiral ) William S. Sims , before a London audience in 1910 , to the effect that Englishmen could always count on their " kindred across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public reprimand .. When , in 1911 , a second Moroccan crisis shook the European continent , Taft showed no inclination to follow in the steps of his predecessor who had played so prominent a // role in the earlier one.2 The halo-Turkish War , that same year , evoked a presidential declaration that this struggle , as well as other rumblings in the Near East , while a " cause of uneasiness in European diplomacy " was " without direct political concern " or " interest " to the United States.3 And the following year , the President took the same stand with respect to the Balkan War , declaring that the United States " was involved neither directly nor indirectly with the causes or questions incident to . . . these hostilities , " and had , therefore , " maintained in regard to them an attitude of absolute neutrality and complete political disinterestedness. " 4 While studiedly avoiding political commitments to , or even active collaboration with , the Powers in relation to European questions , the President stood ready to contribute in his own way to peace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his faith in arbitration as a substitute for war , and he was active in the movement to create an efficient international tribunal for the pacific settlement of justiciable disputes . He deplored the struggle for military and naval supremacy , and pursuant to a congressional resolution passed at the instigation of the " peace lobby , " 5 he made cautious advances to ascertain the possibility of securing an international agreement limiting armaments.6 Pending tangible progress toward universal arbitration and international limitation of armaments , however , Taft refused Rooseveltian Policy Without Roosevelt 283 even to consider any slackening of his own armament program , designed to keep the United States abreast of the Anglo-German naval race . The Administration 's logical steps to this position were not altogether clear . Judging from their public utterances , it would appear that both the President and his Secretary of the Navy believed that failure to keep pace with the European naval race would expose the United States to attack from overseas. ? Such logic was difficult to sustain . The United States Navy at its then existing strength would probably have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possibly Britain 's , that could cross the ocean to assail it. $ And there was little likelihood of any European Power undertaking armed aggression in this hemisphere as long as the Old World continued to seethe from the pressure of imprisoned forces , and the two greatest navies glared at each other across the North Sea . While the Taft administration publicly advanced no cogent reasons for keeping pace with European naval programs , it did not follow that such reasons did not exist . It was arguable that a great navy was desirable as a means of compelling respect for American neutral interests , in case of a general European war involving Germany and Great Britain . It was also arguable that the United States had a vital interest in helping to maintain the European balance of power and , above all , the Anglo-German naval equipoise , which kept the two greatest European fleets , especially Germany 's , confined to European waters . With a navy second only to that of Great // Britain , the goal toward which Roosevelt had worked , the United States could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ either of those Powers from destroying the sea power of the other . While such considerations received some public attention during these pre-war years , ? they were not cited , so far as we are aware , in any public utterance of the Administration , which chiefly supported its policy of keeping pace with European naval development on the ground that European navies constituted a potential standing menace to the territorial security of the United States and the Panama Canal . In relation to the Far East , President Taft and his financially minded Secretary of State , Philander C. Knox of Pennsylvania , projected an aggressive as well as isolationistic policy . Secretary of State John Hay and President Roosevelt had repeatedly endorsed the open-door principle with regard to China , and had striven discreetly to secure as favorable commercial opportunities as possible for Americans in that country . But Hay and Roosevelt had carefully avoided head-on collisions with the Great Powers , whose claims and activities , despite ostensible acceptance of the open door in principle , still denied to Americans equality of opportunity in practice . Taft @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the theory of the open door . To this end they sponsored a scheme for neutralizing the railways in the Russian and Japanese " spheres of interest " in Manchuria ; they backed claims on behalf of American capital to share equally in loans to China , and otherwise asserted the right of Americans to participate on an equality with other foreigners in that country.10 Such demands naturally irritated all the Powers maintaining special spheres and concessions in China . In particular , it // placed the United States squarely in the way of the imperial progress of Japan . Yet Taft and Knox , pressing their claims as settled rights to which Americans were unquestionably entitled , showed no inclination to approach the Far East in a spirit of compromise , or to offer anything in return for concessions to the United States . Nor did they manifest any disposition to approach the East through Europe as Roosevelt and Hay had done , or even to view American claims in relation to the world situation . On the contrary , they not only pressed their aggressive Asiatic policy without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine disregard for possible European repercussions . " A strong navy would appear to be an obvious corollary of such a policy of intervention . The Administration 's aggressive , singlehanded assault on the entrenched interests of the Powers clearly called for a fleet able if necessary to carry on offensive war in the Western Pacific . And such , it appeared , was the view of the President , who began his Administration with an unqualified endorsement of his predecessor 's naval policy , and with the declared intention of " backing up " American " interests " " in the Orient " with something more potent than " mere verbal protest . . . . " 12 THE REVOLT OF CONGRESS Events , conditions , and personalities , rather than large conceptions of national interest and policy , set rigid practical limits both to the Administration 's naval program and to the response of Congress . In the first place , neither the President nor his otherwise capable Secretary of the Navy , George von Lengerke Meyer , possessed the necessary capacity for political leadership . Second , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the incipient political insurgency that traditionally // goes with hard times . Finally , a bitter intersectional tariff struggle early in the new regime smashed the discipline and solidarity of the Republican organization in Congress , and all but destroyed the political influence of the President . Hard times , intersectional warfare , and intraparty strife hardly produced a favorable atmosphere in which to launch a great naval program . Indeed , so unfavorable was the fiscal and political outlook in the autumn of 1909 that the President felt constrained to ask Congress for only two battleships , instead of the four recommended by the General Board and annually demanded by Roosevelt since 1907.13 And so unfavorable did the outlook continue that the next year 's program also was kept down to two capital ships.14 At this rate , the United States would rapidly lose place in the struggle for naval supremacy . Yet only with great difficulty did the Administration secure congressional sanction to lay down even two battleships in 1910,15 and , with greater difficulty , to do the same in 1911.16 And worse was in store ! The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the House , cut down Republican strength in the Senate , and enlarged the so-called Progressive bloc , recruited chiefly from the Middle West . Anticipating trouble , the Administration tried Rooseveltian tactics . A great review of the Atlantic Fleet was staged at New York , and a similar review of the Pacific Fleet at San Diego , in November 1911 , shortly before the opening of Congress.17 These splendid and carefully // publicized pageants set the stage for public appeals by Secretary Meyer " and the President , and for pointed editorials in the pro-navy press.l9 But Congress ignored Administration appeals , editorial criticism , and pressure by various interested groups . The House Naval Committee , acting under orders from the Democratic congressional caucus , reported a naval appropriation bill without provision for any battleships at all.20 There was a stormy debate , and numerous attempts to add battleship amendments , but the Democratic lines held , and the bill went to the Senate still lacking any provision for battleships . While it was pending there the Democratic National Convention met at Baltimore , nominated Woodrow Wilson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Two days later the Senate voted two battleships into the bill.21 Then , after a deadlock lasting until midAugust , the House Democrats , whose position had been undermined by the turn of events at Baltimore , compromised on one battleship 22 Once more the Administration prepared for the struggle . There was another splendid review of the Fleet lasting three days in mid-October , at the height of the presidential cam- // paign.23 Speaking before a great banquet in New York City , the President , now campaigning for reelection , made a strong plea for the Navy . And Secretary Meyer , before the same assemblage , took Congress severely to task for obstructing the Administration 's program 24 Even after his crushing defeat at the polls , the President made one more stand , this time for three battleships to make up for the preceding year 's deficiency.25 The House Naval Committee pared the program down to two.20 A bipartisan bloc consisting chiefly of Southerners and Middle Westerners27 forced it down to one , by threatening a filibuster.28 The upper chamber restored the number to two ; 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the clock ticked off the final hours of the session , and the crowds gathered for the inauguration of a new President.3 ? One result of Taft 's four-year struggle with Congress was the development of a still more " top-heavy " navy . A balanced fighting fleet should have included not only first-class battleships , but also fast scout cruisers , destroyer flotillas to protect the capital ships , and various other classes of vessels in certain recognized proportions . Forced to make compromises at every turn , the Administration had sacrificed cruisers , destroyers , and the other essential components of a fighting fleet , in its desperate , but futile , attempt to keep pace with capital-ship construction abroad . This course was justified on a theory and two hopes . // The theory was that first-class battleships were the ultimate index of naval power . The hopes were , that the European naval race would slow down , and that the situation in Congress would improve sufficiently to allow the United States to catch up in the so-called auxiliary categories.31 This policy of sacrificing everything for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the circumstances , resulted in a fleet with deficiencies as a fighting organization , which might have proved fatal in a contest with a well balanced hostile fleet.32 Another result of Taft 's losing struggle with Congress was to emphasize the supreme importance of vigorous executive leadership , party discipline , and one-party control . Lack of astute political leadership handicapped the Taft administration from first to last . Insurgency within the Republican Party aggravated the situation . And Democratic control of the House during the last two years of the Administration insured disaster . Under these conditions , as on previous occasions , the Navy became a football of partisan politics , a victim of patronage , and a subject of pork-barrel legislation . It is significant that Congress , while drastically curtailing the Administration 's building program , did not reduce naval appropriations , but , on the contrary , increased them by some sixty million dollars over the last four years of the Roosevelt regime ; and that the Democratic House , in the winter of 1912-1913 , while ruthlessly paring down the President 's battleship program , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ date.33 Third , the traditional partisan and sectional cleavages were still in evidence . With very few exceptions , seaboard Republicans backed the Administration 's program , while many from the interior voted with the opposition . Interior Democrats were preponderantly opposed to increasing the Navy , while // their seaboard colleagues were markedly divided . It was a fatal coincidence that Republican insurgency was strongest in those sections which had traditionally opposed a big navy . And while desire to discredit the Republican President unquestionably determined many Democratic votes , it also happened that some of the strongholds of Democratic power were also regions where small-navy sentiment had traditionally prevailed.34 Finally , the progressive revolt of Congress against the naval program of the Taft administration is not without significance as an index of opinion within the national legislature , and possibly also in the country at large , during those final years of peace . Many advocates of a stronger navy were unquestionably sincere . But the number who showed any real anxiety regarding the present or future security of the United States , was virtually negligible . And one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the minority report of the House Naval Committee , in February 1913 , well summed up the prevailing state of opinion . " . . . For the purpose of defending our country against attacks from any nation on earth we confidently believe that our Navy is amply sufficient and fully adequate , and for any other purpose we need no navy at all . " 35 POLITICS , ADMINISTRATION , AND NAVAL STRATEGY While waging a losing struggle to keep pace with foreign building programs , the Taft administration was simultaneously battling with politics , inertia , and prejudice , in a strenuous effort to carry forward Roosevelt 's unfinished work of welding ships , men , and equipment into an efficient fighting machine . Further progress was made in fleet organization and training . With the completion of additional units , the Atlantic Fleet was increased to twenty-one battleships ? four divisions of five ships // each , and a flagship . By reducing the necessary periodic overhauls to a system , work at the navy yards was maintained at a fairly uniform level , and four ships in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no slackening in gunnery training , tactical drills , and fleet maneuvers . And Secretary Meyer was also instrumental in recommissioning and organizing the older vessels into the Atlantic and Pacific Reserve Fleets.36 Meyer likewise made some progress with the thorny problem of Navy Department reorganization . Opposition from within the Department , as well as from Congress , it will be recalled , had blocked Roosevelt 's efforts to create a general staff of line officers to advise the Secretary on policy , and to direct and coordinate naval administration in the interest of military efficiency . Roosevelt 's frontal attacks having failed , Meyer tried a flank movement . Instead of confronting Congress with another general staff proposal , he secured expert advice , and then went ahead on his own responsibility.37 The Department was divided into four sections : fleet operations , personnel , material , and inspections . The existing bureaus were grouped under these sections , according to the kind of service performed . Over each section was placed a high-ranking line officer with the title of " aid . " Individually , each aid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his jurisdiction . Collectively , the four aids were to constitute an advisory council on departmental policy and administration as a whole . This plan was a step toward a general staff , and , in conjunction with other administrative reforms introduced by Meyer , greatly increased the military efficiency of the Navy Department.38 The next step was to secure congressional endorsement of these reforms . Successive efforts to this end , 39 however , produced . // little result . Congress sanctioned a few administrative changes , 4 ? but ignored requests to put the aid system upon a permanent statutory basis . While there is little direct evidence on this point , one may infer from the general drift of congressional opinion , that many Senators and Representatives preferred to keep the status quo , even at the expense of military efficiency , rather than sanction any concentration of executive power in the hands of the Line , which , as previously stated , might jeopardize the ability of Congress to exploit the Navy for the mutual benefit of favored constituencies and electioneering politicians.41 This conflict between politics and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the navy-yard problem . Germany at this time was maintaining only three home navy yards , and Great Britain only six . The United States , in contrast , had eleven such establishments , nine on the Atlantic , and two on the Pacific , as well as a variety of smaller naval stations . Yet these eleven yards altogether contained fewer drydocks than the single largest British yard , and they were otherwise inadequately equipped , despite the millions of dollars annually poured into them.42 Now as previously , politics barred the way to reform . Secretary Meyer might and did reiterate that the navy yards existed for the fleet ; but Congress had long acted on the contrary theory , that the fleet existed for the navy yards . The House and Senate naval committees were invariably loaded with members from constituencies possessing navy yards or stations . These members habitually supported each other 's claims on the Treasury . Any move against particular establishments drew protests and even threats of reprisal from the constituencies // and members afected.43 And if the Administration persisted in its course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight to the floor of House or Senate , where they could usually muster support enough to defeat the proposed reform.44 Against this unfortunate situation , Meyer waged unremitting if cautious warfare.45 In one way or another , he introduced needed reforms in navy-yard management . He closed the yards at Pensacola and New Orleans , as well as smaller coaling stations in Maryland and Connecticut . And he sponsored systematic development of docking and other facilities , with a view to the efficiency and well-being of the Navy as a whole.46 Meyer also attacked the closely related problem of developing an adequate naval base in the West Indies . Naval officers had long desired such a base , but had unfortunately disagreed as to the best location.47 The prospective opening of the Panama Canal forced this question to the front . While the danger of European aggression in the Western Hemisphere was remote , it was nevertheless considered necessary , as a precautionary measure , to equip and fortify an insular station where an American fleet in the Caribbean could readily secure fuel , supplies , and emergency repairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was Guantanamo Bay on the southeast coast of Cuba . With a well equipped station at Guantanamo , the American fleet could command all the passages into the Caribbean and the Gulf of Mexico.48 Development of this site would , there- footnote 43 See , for example , the revelations published in the Army and Navy Journal , Vol . XLIX ( Dec. 2 , 1911 ) , p. 412 ; ( Dec. 9 ) , p. 431 ; Vol . L ( Jan. 25 , 1913 ) , p. 644 . On the last cited date , the Journal quoted the New Orleans Picayune to the effect that " a determined stand " on the part of the Southern members " against any battleship increase . . . would do more to bring the Navy Department to terms for closing the New Orleans navy yard than any other course of procedure . " // fore , increase the security not only of the Canal , but also of the Gulf seaboard as well , thereby removing the only strategic justification for maintaining any navy yards in the Gulf States . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Guantanamo , but Congress had voted no funds for it since 1904 . Finally in 1911 , after urgent appeals from the Administration , Congress voted another small appropriation , and work was resumed without delay . But the decision of the Administration to close the Pensacola and New Orleans navy yards , and its request in the interest of economy to transfer some of their equipment to Guantanamo , produced an uproar in the Gulf States , with congressional repercussions that all but wrecked the enterprise and effectually prevented early completion of the station at Guantanamo.49 Domestic politics also largely conditioned the disposition of American forces afloat . The North Atlantic Squadron , it will be recalled , had evolved by stages into the great fleet of battleships which Roosevelt sent around the world . On the return of this fleet , it was generally assumed that it would remain in the Atlantic . Yet there was no compelling international reason for keeping it there . The Anglo-German naval race , as well as the growing political tension that was hurrying the Old World on to disaster , at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The declared policy of the Taft administration was rigid abstention from commitments to the European Powers , as well as from entanglement in Old World crises and wars . The presence of the main fleet in the Atlantic , at least in time of peace , had little bearing or effect , therefore , on the political relations of the United States with Europe.5 ? // The presence of the battleship fleet in the Pacific , on the other hand , would have greatly strengthened the Administration 's hand in the Far East . Taft 's aggressive policy of intervention in China , if not pure bluff , implied ability , even if reluctance , to use force against Japan . In case of a rupture with that country , the theater of war would inevitably embrace a large area in the Western Pacific , with the Philippines as one of the pawns in the game . It is arguable that the presence of the battleship fleet in the Pacific after 1909 might have exerted a strong deterrent influence , as it clearly had in 1908 ; and that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the Far East . All proposals to transfer the fleet to the Pacific , however , were flatly rejected . This stand was publicly justified on grounds of expense and inadequacy of existing shore facilities in the Pacific.51 A far more compelling motive , one strongly suspects , was fear of the political repercussions that such a move would produce on the Atlantic seaboard . The East Coast had long claimed a vested interest in the fleet.52 And the Administration had to depend on the Eastern seaboard for the congressional votes necessary to save its naval building program from total disaster . If the Asiatic policy of the Taft administration , as well as the general political situation in the Far East , called for sta- // tioning a fleet of battleships in the Pacific , these conditions also called for maintaining a first-class naval base either in Guam or in the Philippine Islands . To fight the Japanese Navy without such a base would involve formidable if not insuperable difficulties . Naval officers were generally agreed on this point , and practically unanimous in the opinion that Olongapo , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was the best site , and the only one defensible against attack by sea . But the Army had demurred on the ground that Olongapo was vulnerable to attack by land . And Admiral Robley D. Evans declared bluntly in 1910 that many had opposed Olongapo because of its isolation from the metropolitan delights of Manila.53 Be that as it may , the question had dragged along from year to year , with the Navy Department making shift with the old Cavite station in Manila Bay , and gradually developing Olongapo as funds were available.64 Finally , in 1909 , a joint army and navy board ended the impasse by recommending that the government abandon the idea of developing a first-class base in the Philippines , locate its principal insular base at Pearl Harbor in the Hawaiian Islands , and maintain only a small , unfortified station at Olongapo . The Taft administration ratified this decision , and Congress voted the funds necessary to begin work on a large scale at Pearl Harbor.55 The decision to establish a strong naval base in Hawaii was unquestionably a sound one . While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters was remote , the strategic importance of the Panama Canal was so great as to justify this development which clinched the American Navy 's hold on the Central and Eastern Pacific . The decision with reference to the Philippines was more questionable . It was publicly explained that " changed conditions in the Pacific " rendered it unnecessary to have a strong // naval base in the Philippines.66 Yet it is difficult to escape the conclusion that conditions in the Pacific had changed for the worse , rather than for the better . The immigration question , if momentarily quiescent , was not settled . And the Taft administration had deliberately set out to thwart Japanese ambitions in Asia . As long as the United States followed these policies , there would be tension between the two countries . And as long as the American flag floated over Manila , naval strategists had to envisage a war with Japan , fought in the Western Pacific , to defend the Philippines in the name of national honor and prestige . Defense of these distant islands hinged on command of what were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters , which was absolutely prerequisite to sending troops and military supplies to the Philippines , was to be established only by destroying or blockading the Japanese Navy . To expect the United States Navy to accomplish such a gigantic feat without a first-class base in the Western Pacific was to expect something never before achieved in naval warfare.57 The retirement of President Taft , in March 1913 , closed a strange chapter in the rise of American naval power . Without any comprehensive discussion of national aims , or of the relation of naval power thereto , the Administration had vainly labored to hold the naval rank attained under Roosevelt . Under the capable direction of Secretary Meyer and his well chosen professional advisers , the Navy had attained a new standard of military efficiency . But the exigencies of domestic politics had severely restricted the scope of administrative reform and forced opportunistic compromises in the disposition of the fleet . And there had been an inexplicable failure to face the implications of the Administration 's Asiatic policy , and to prepare sys- . // tematically for the war that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States tried to block Japanese projects in Asia , while persisting in retaining in the Western Pacific an insular possession which was virtually a hostage to Japan . Thus viewed as a whole , the naval policy of the Taft administration appears as a strange blend of intelligent planning , sound achievement , political opportunism , strategic myopia , inconsistency , and frustration . And in the background , affecting policy at every turn , stood that placid indifference to world affairs , and that pervading sense of security which characterized American public opinion in those final years of peace . Politics and Policy on the Eve of the Great War ( 1913 ? 1914 ) THE political campaign of 1912 resulted in the election of a Democratic President , and the return of Democratic majorities to both branches of Congress . President Wilson took office March 4 , 1913 . The new Administration 's policies took form during the ensuing months . In December , its naval program was laid before Congress . In due course , this program was substantially embodied in the regular naval appropriation bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the bill was passed and sent to the President , who signed it on June 30 ? two days after the assassination of an Austrian prince had ignited the train leading to the long-feared , long-discussed war which the staggering burden of armaments was supposed to prevent . That this conflict , the most destructive and widespread of modern times , would profoundly affect the United States , was realized from the very beginning . But few men dreamed of the revolutionary political and naval consequences that were in store for the United States . Even today , it is difficult to appreciate the politico-naval implications of what took place between 1914 and 1918 . One can do it , if at all , only by viewing the postwar landscape against the pre-war situation of the United States , against the foreign policy and naval program of the Wilson administration , and against the drift of American naval policy and opinion in that final year of peace . 30o The Rise of American Naval Power POLITICO-STRATEGIC BACKGROUND The politico-strategic situation of the United States on the eve of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakness . Within the Western Hemisphere , the United States had achieved a position of strategic invulnerability . Technical obstacles to military aggression from overseas , as discussed in preceding chapters , gave the United States Navy , at its then existing strength , a wide margin of supremacy throughout the Eastern Pacific , and in the Western Atlantic ( including , of course , the Caribbean ) at least as far south as the Equator . And the Anglo-German naval equipoise , the complicated balance of power in Europe , and the secondary balance in the Far East , effectually tied the hands of every Great Power whose financial , political , or military leaders might otherwise have seriously contemplated armed aggression against the republics of the Western Hemisphere ) . In the Far East the position of the United States was more vulnerable . Though repudiating the methods of the Taft administration , President Wilson showed no disposition to renounce the traditional aims of American diplomacy in Eastern Asia . On the contrary , he expressly affirmed the open-door and integrity-of-China doctrines , in terms which left no doubt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the newborn Chinese Republic against all imperialistic aggressors.2 Simul- // taneously , the Japanese question had again flared up in California , this time over discriminatory state legislation pertaining to land ownership . While Wilson and his Secretary of State , William Jennings Bryan , resolutely refrained from warlike gestures , 3 and strove earnestly to save Japanese " face " and prestige , they could make no real concessions , and the basic issue remained unsettled , a potential source of future trouble.4 The Philippine problem was another disturbing factor in the Pacific . While the Democratic platform of i 912 had promised independence to the Filipinos , the date and extent of American withdrawal was still undetermined. ? As long as the United States continued to exclude Japanese immigrants , to discriminate against those already in America , and to oppose Japanese expansion in Asia , there would be smoldering ill-will that might at any moment blaze up into another crisis , and even eventuate in war . And as long as the United States , under these conditions , retained any vestige of sovereignty over the Philippines , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western Pacific , these islands , as already stated , would remain a vulnerable outpost which might become a grave strategic liability . With respect to Europe , the Wilson administration , like its predecessor , moved cautiously in the traditional path of nonintervention and isolation . The President supported Secretary Bryan 's project of negotiating treaties of conciliation and arbitration with European , as well as non-European , states ; but these treaties were not regarded as having any entangling political implications. ? Wilson also permitted Colonal Edward M. House , his intimate friend and counsellor , to visit Europe early in 1914 , to explore in a quasi-official capacity the possibility of relieving the political tension of the Old World . But it is not clear that the President fully understood the scope of House 's grand project of uniting the German , British , and American // Navies to enforce peace . And it may be doubted if Wilson , at that date , would have sanctioned an enterprise so intimately associating the United States in the politics of Europe. ? At first glance , the attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have no naval implications at all . Yet this certainly was not the case . As already noted in several previous connections , the United States derived great strategic advantage from the European balance of power , and especially from the Anglo-German naval equipoise which effectually confined the two greatest fleets within European waters . Destruction of either fleet ? especially Britain 's ? would potentially diminish the security of the United States in the Atlantic . A general war in Europe , moreover , would inevitably cause violent repercussions in the Far East . It would certainly compel at least a temporary withdrawal of European forces , and might possibly eliminate the European Powers from the Far East altogether . Even a temporary withdrawal would jeopardize the position of the United States in that region , and might even force American statesmen to choose between abandoning their time-honored Asiatic policies and attempting singlehandedly to block the imperialistic expansion of a Japan freed from the multiple pressures inherent in the traditional balance of power in the Far East . Thus , taking a long view and considering all possible eventualities , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the eve of the Great War called for a greater navy than at any previous period in the history of the United States.8 NAVAL PROGRAM OF THE WILSON ADMINISTRATION The Democratic Party , it is recalled , had historically stood for a moderate naval policy . A majority of the congressional // opponents of Roosevelt 's and Taft 's naval programs had been Democrats . And the Democratic caucus in the House had managed the parliamentary strategy which , in 1912 , had brought Taft 's building program almost to a standstill . On the other hand , the Democratic National Convention of that year had endorsed a platform containing a strong-navy plank . The President-elect was widely regarded as rather a big-navy man.9 And for Secretary of the Navy , he selected Josephus Daniels , a North Carolina editor who had actively supported the naval policy of the Taft administration.10 The naval outlook continued a topic of speculation throughout the spring , summer , and autumn of 1913 , with frequent predictions that the Administration would present a legislative program as ambitious as that sponsored by the Taft regime @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In his first annual message to Congress , President Wilson made no specific reference to naval policy , but merely gave blanket endorsement to the annual reports of the various executive departments.12 The report of Secretary Daniels embodied a building program not radically different from that of the Taft administration , but his accompanying exposition bore little resemblance to the reports of Secretary Meyer . Daniels prefaced his concrete demands with a discussion of the armament problem , paying special attention to a recent suggestion , put forward by Winston Churchill , First Lord of the Admiralty in Great Britain , that the Great Powers cease laying down warships for a year.13 This idea appealed to Daniels , who deplored the feverish competition in armaments . He took the view that no " single nation , with large interests , " could by itself , " safely take a vacation in the building of battleships . " . // Moreover , it was " not merely a vacation " that was needed , " but a permanent policy to guard against extravagant and needless expansion . " To this end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to discuss plans for limiting armaments . With refreshing optimism and a fine disregard for political realities , he thought that " it ought not to be difficult to secure an agreement by which navies will be adequate without being overgrown and without imposing overheavy taxation upon the industry of a nation . " Pending such an achievement , Daniels held that the " wise naval policy for the United States " was " to find the golden mean . " On the one hand , he rejected all proposals to stop building up the Navy ; on the other , he did not fully endorse the program put forward by the General Board , which called for immediate construction of four more battleships and a large number of smaller warships and naval auxiliaries . With a view to keeping naval expenditures " within the limits of the country 's probable income , " he asked Congress for only two battleships , eight destroyers , and three submarines.14 Daniels next turned to matters patently more to his taste . He had ambitious plans for reopening and expanding all the government navy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ordnance , and powder factories , oil refineries , and coal mines , as a means of breaking the grip of powerful industrial corporations which , he maintained , were exploiting the government by means of collusive bidding for contracts , and by " exorbitant " prices charged for equipment , supplies , and services . Daniels had equally ambitious plans for developing the Navy into a " great university , " for providing religious instruction and leadership , and for otherwise promoting the welfare of the Navy 's enlisted personnel.16 Nowhere in this document can one detect the slightest trace // of anxiety regarding the country 's security . Daniels spoke complacently of the Navy 's existing power and efficiency . He had not one word to say with respect to the naval implications of the Administration 's foreign policies . And there is little to indicate that he had given any serious consideration at all to this fundamental problem.17 THE GENERAL BOARD 'S PROGRAM In 1913 , for the first time , the views of the General Board of the Navy were formally spread upon the public record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on war plans and other phases of policy , had been in existence since 1 goo . Its recommendations embodied the best professional opinion obtainable . Previous Administrations had frequently acted upon these recommendations , but had generally kept the Board from coming into direct contact with the public or even with Congress . The Wilson administration , for reasons not altogether clear , reversed this precedent , publishing , as an appendix to the Secretary 's report , a comprehensive memorandum by the General Board on naval policy and permitting a representative of that body to testify before the naval committees of Congress.18 The General Board 's memorandum opened with a statement deploring the Navy 's haphazard development . The United States had not now , and had never had , a long-term policy . The Board , as far back as igo3 , had formulated such a policy , but this had never received executive sanction , and was not " understood by the people or Congress . " It was high time that Congress adopt a long-term policy , " founded on our national needs and aims . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving the widest publicity " to its own views on policy , " taking the // people and the Congress into . . . full confidence . . . inviting intelligent criticism as well as support . " The Board 's program rested upon the premise that the United States should have a navy " powerful enough to prevent or answer any challenge " to its " well established national policies . . . . The absolute strength necessary to accomplish this " depended " upon the national policies of prospective challengers and the force which they can bring to bear against us , and , hence , is relative and varies with their naval policies and building programs . " The power of a navy depended upon two elements : the excellence of its equipment , and of its personnel . " . . . The two must expand and grow together until the needed power is attained . " The unit of power was the first-line battleship . But the life of such ships , and their " continued power to act " in war , depended upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ auxiliaries in recognized proportion . . . . " The Board 's program called for 48 battleships , 192 destroyers , g6 submarines , 24 colliers and tankers , 12 destroyer tenders , 12 submarine tenders , 6 ammunition ships , 6 supply ships , 6 transports , and ( tentatively ) g6 airplanes . This force , " ready for action by 1920 , " the Board believed to be the smallest that would give us a fleet " equal or superior to that of any probable enemy . . . . " ls The specific connotations of this program were more fully developed at a hearing of the House Naval Committee . Asked what well established American policies required a force of this size , Admiral Charles Vreeland , representing the General Board , mentioned the Monroe Doctrine , the open door in China , and exclusion of Asiatics from the United States . Questioned as to probable aggressors , he gave guarded answers which , however , disclosed that Germany and japan were considered the Powers most likely to challenge one or more of these policies . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its geographical isolation . He also // admitted that conditions in the Old World , at least for the time being , effectually tied the French , German , and British Navies to European waters . But he placed little reliance upon political factors , for " no one , " he insisted , with complete disregard for the continuity of European politics , could " predict what alliances and ententes may exist a year hence . " He felt still greater anxiety regarding conditions in the Pacific . The danger there was not so much that the Japanese Navy would launch an attack against our continental seaboard , as that our anti-Japanese policies might inspire reprisals against American possessions in the Western Pacific . And Japan , unlike the European Powers , could wage war on the United States with the entire naval resources at its command.20 CROSS CURRENTS IN CONGRESS The Administration 's policy of continuing capital-ship construction , with the General Board 's larger plans looming in the background , precipitated a parliamentary struggle which brought into sharp relief the antithetical currents of congressional opinion in the spring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republican minority , but revealed a deep cleavage within the dominant party . A combination of Republicans and big-navy Democrats reported a bill from the House Naval Committee , substantially in accord with the recommendations of the Secretary of the Navy.21 A group of four Democratic committeemen carried the fight to the floor with a minority report , vigorously attacking the Committee 's Administration bill.22 This report , as well as the terms of the bill , evoked a debate which continued for weeks during April and May . At one extreme stood Representative Richmond P. Hobson , // Democrat from Alabama , a former naval officer , and the lower chamber 's most vigorous champion of a big navy . The American people , Hobson assumed , had no aggressive designs on any country . But other nations , he maintained , had policies that menaced our national security , and our system of national defense should be framed with a view to the actual situation confronting us . The British Navy gave him no concern , because Britain had no army to follow up a naval victory by invading @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hostage that would always restrain Britain 's hand . Germany , on the contrary , was a real menace . That Power had a great army and a merchant marine adequate to transport that army across the Atlantic , as soon as the German Fleet should have destroyed our Navy . And Hobson placed no reliance upon the supposedly inhibiting effects of the European balance of power . He also regarded the combined Army and Navy of Japan as a menace , not only to our insular possessions in the Pacific , but even to our western continental seaboard . In his eyes , " America 's true naval policy , . . . simple , inevitable , with no idea of aggression upon anyone , " was " to have always in the Atlantic a fleet equal to the German Navy and to have always in the Pacific a fleet equal to the Japanese Navy . " 23 At the other extreme stood a group violently opposed to building any more battleships at all , at least for the time being . The leaders of this group , chiefly Middle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standard , but maintained that our Navy already had indisputable command throughout the Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific . They cited statistics to show that the fleet was relatively much stronger than the big-navy men admitted.25 And they stressed the unstable condi- // tions in Europe and the Far East , which , they sincerely believed , absolutely precluded any aggression against the United States.26 Disclaiming any hostility to the Navy per se , they declared that Congress and the country were simply victims of unfounded rumors and alarms , traceable to various groups interested in building up the Navy for economic , political , professional , or other selfish purposes.27 Between these extremes ranged all shades of opinion . Representative William E. Williams , Democrat from Illinois , a member of the Naval Committee , was perhaps the best-informed and most moderate in tone . Williams felt no anxiety regarding an attack on the United States proper . Conditions in Europe and the Far East rendered such an aggression improbable , and our geographical isolation was an all but insurmountable strategic barrier . Our Navy was already more than sufficient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attack us . But that was only half of the picture . The United States was committed to certain policies ? notably the Monroe Doctrine and the open door in China ? and we had assumed " gratuitous responsibilities in the Philippines . . . . " With all due respect to the naval experts , he doubted whether anyone could say exactly what measure of naval power might be necessary to halt all possible aggressors in South America or the Far East . Personally , he believed that our existing power was sufficient . But other navies were forging ahead rapidly , and ours must likewise , in order to sustain our relatively strong position . For this reason , there- // fore , he intended to support the Administration 's comparatively moderate building program.28 In the end , such arguments prevailed , and the bill as it finally passed both chambers provided for two more battleships , and also a third , contingent on sale of the relatively new but hopelessly obsolete Idaho and Mississippi.29 Another provision of the Act of June 30 , 1914 , is likewise significant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeks before the outbreak of war in Europe . The Administration 's program included three submarines , without specification as to type.30 The bill reported from the House Naval Committee , provided for " one seagoing submarine torpedo boat , three coast defense submarine torpedo boats , and four small torpedo boats intended for harbor defense . " 31 And the bill as finally passed authorized one " seagoing " submarine , and " seven or more " submarines of " coast and harbor defense type . " 32 Here , within a few weeks of the Great War , was a surprising congressional revival of the theory of passive defense . There had been forewarnings , however , of such a revival , in the congressional debates touching on the strategic functions and value of torpedo boats and , later , of submarines ; and in the willingness of many members of Congress , in the first decade of the twentieth century , to vote for large numbers of submarines , while opposing additional battleships.33 But Congress had never gone so far as to authorize submarines specially designed for " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such // phraseology in 1914 remains something of an enigma . About all one can say is that this phraseology unquestionably reflected strategic views long associated with the Democratic Party , and still popular in the South and Middle West ; and that it may well have been used merely to procure votes needed for the Administration 's naval program as a whole . This revival , in a modern form , of the doctrine of passive coast defense , was symptomatic of the confusion and unreality that still pervaded American civilian discussion of naval policy on the eve of the Great War . The amazing vitality of this doctrine was possibly attributable to our geographical isolation and the consequent sense of security which had traditionally conditioned American thinking on naval matters . Against this pervading conviction of security , advocates of a big navy flung themselves , often without the slightest visible result . In their efforts to break through the wall of public ignorance and apathy , they sometimes indulged in wild flights of imagination as , for example , when they pictured the German Fleet , with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of miles from its nearest bases , to destroy the American Navy , seize the Panama Canal , and open the way for the German Army , following in a great fleet of transports , to invade and lay waste the United States . Such alarms partially served their purpose of frightening people into supporting larger naval appropriations . But such flights transferred the discussion of naval policy from the world of cold reality to the realm of emotion , and may well have contributed , as much as did the ignorance and apathy against which they were directed , to the failure of the American people and their official spokesmen , right down to the war , to develop a sound , realistic opinion on the great question of naval defense . THE outbreak of the Great War in August 1914 , foreshadowed an upward surge of navalism within the United States . President Wilson 's policy of neutrality which , from the winter of 1914-1915 , necessarily envisaged the possibility of American entry into the war , called into question the Navy 's readiness and adequacy , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or to play an effective role in case the United States joined one of the warring coalitions . Sober consideration of these eventualities , the pressure of special interests , and the exhilarating effects of war viewed from a safe distance , gave rise to an organized agitation for " preparedness , " which steadily gathered momentum during the year 1915 . The propaganda of individuals and organized groups , the exigencies of domestic politics , the course of events in Europe , the temperament of the President , and above all , the logic of his neutrality policy , impelled the Administration toward a program of warlike preparation which found partial expression in the great Naval Bill of 1916 ; passage of which marked another milestone in the rise of American naval power . INITIAL IMPACT OF THE WAR The outbreak of war in Europe had surprisingly little immediate effect on naval policy in America . From August until // mid-October there was practically no public discussion either of the possibility that the American Navy might eventually play a role in this conflict , or of the possible bearing of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' Then , almost overnight , silence gave way to heated debate , following the publication by Representative Augustus F. Gardner , Republican from Massachusetts , of sensational charges regarding the condition of our national defenses , and his introduction in Congress of a resolution calling for public investigation of the military and naval establishments.2 The response of the Administration was vigorous and unmistakable . President Wilson at first ridiculed , and then denounced Gardner 's proposal.3 Secretary of the Navy Daniels declared that the Fleet 's recent operations in Mexican waters4 " showed that country that the Navy is always ready ; that it lives in a state of preparedness. . . . " 5 And the President went before Congress , early in December , with an annual message designed to silence all the Gardners in the land . The United States , he reminded his countrymen , was " at peace with all the world . " And no one , speaking " from a just and candid interpretation of realities " could show " reason to fear " aggression from any quarter . Asserting that " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and natural means of defense , " he implied that we already had such a navy , deplored current attempts to alarm the public , denied the existence of any emergency , and calmly stated his intention to continue the orderly , unhurried development of our power upon the seas // This attitude found concrete expression in the Administration 's legislative program . The General Board 's recommendations for increasing the Navy only slightly exceeded those of the preceding year. ? Yet Secretary Daniels , as on the previous occasion , drastically pared them down in the interest of economy. $ He took the same stand with regard to the personnel shortage which , according to expert opinion , was handicapping the Navy in peace , and would seriously curtail its operations in war . Daniels consented to establishing a reserve corps of men who had formerly served in the Navy , 9 but he was immovably opposed to increasing the active enlisted force . When the General Board , in its annual report for 1914 , placed the personnel deficiency at 19,600 , Daniels refused to publish the report until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he took the position , in his own annual report , that the enlisted strength of the Navy was adequate for all existing requirements.1 ? Proceedings in Congress revealed the same pervading sense of security . The House Naval Committee , after listening to a great deal of conflicting testimony on the existing condition of the Navy , 11 reported a bill providing for an increase of only two battleships , six destroyers , three auxiliary vessels , and seventeen submarines12 ? a program , except for the larger number of // submarines , practically identical with the one reported the preceding year , before the outbreak of war in Europe.13 The ensuing debate showed a marked disposition to regard the Navy as already adequate , and to discount allegations respecting its unreadiness for war . There was objection to voting more battleships , on the ground that submarines were about to drive heavy armored ships from the sea . While congressional leaders managed to carry the provision for two battleships , it taxed their resources to do so.14 On the other hand there was little opposition to authorizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in war could not possibly extend very far from the coast . ' 5 The prevailing attitude was further revealed in connection with a project for creating an Office of Naval Operations to perform the functions of a general staff . This project was sponsored by Representative Richmond P. Hobson , Democrat from Alabama , who , it will be recalled , was the lower chamber 's most outspoken champion of naval expansion . Hobson 's plan , drafted in collaboration with Admiral Bradley A. Fiske , called for a Chief of Naval Operations who , with the aid of fifteen assistants , would be " responsible for the readiness of the Navy for war and be charged with its general direction . " As finally enacted , however , the clause provided for a Chief , without any assistants , " who shall , under the direction of the Secretary of the Navy , be charged with the operations of the fleet , and with preparation and readiness of plans for its use in war . " The change of phraseology , emphasized by our italics , struck at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said to be the work of certain Administration leaders who were absolutely opposed to strengthening professional influence in the Navy Department.15 " // The indifference , if not actual hostility , of Wilson , Daniels , and a majority of the Democratic Senators and Representatives , during the winter of 1914-1915 , to all projects for military and naval preparedness , apparently reflected the drift of opinion in most of the sections and social groups whose votes had put the Democratic administration and congressional majorities in office and which alone could keep them there . " A nation-wide newspaper poll , following Wilson 's declaration of policy , early in December , clearly suggested such a conclusion . While 285 out of 400 editors to whom the Literary Digest sent questionnaires favored strengthening the Navy , there was no agreement as to how much . This poll also showed big-navy sentiment stronger among metropolitan editors than among those in small towns and cities . Such sentiment was strongest along the Middle and North Atlantic , and Pacific seaboards , weaker in the South Atlantic States , and weakest in the Gulf @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The drift of inland opinion was further disclosed by another poll , taken by the Columbus ( Ohio ) Citizen . This poll , based upon nearly 150,000 returns from persons in twenty Middle Western cities , showed sentiment running , three to two against increasing the Army and Navy . ' 7 And these findings coincided with the impressions of competent political observers during the ensuing months.18 Thus , while the country as a whole was sharply divided on the issue of national defense , there were indications that those sections which had shown the greatest Democratic voting strength in the presidential election of 191219 were generally supporting the Administration and the Democratic majorities // in Congress in resistance to the " preparedness " drive that was rapidly getting under way in the winter of 1914-1915 . THE GREAT PREPAREDNESS MOVEMENT A detailed study of the great " preparedness " campaign of 1915 would itself fill a volume . But we can not neglect this movement altogether , for no one can possibly understand either the dynamics of naval legislation during the war , or the drift of American thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knowledge of the propaganda campaign that preceded the great Army and Navy Acts of 1916 . And one can not fairly analyze or even understand the preparedness campaign and its results without taking cognizance of the intellectual fog that rolled in across the Atlantic after the outbreak of war in Europe and eventually surged westward , blanketing the country with rumors , half-truths , and even falsehoods , all of which stimulated the demand for military preparedness within the United States and , at the same time rendered millions of Americans emotionally receptive to propaganda calculated to produce an unreasoning clamor of fear and hysteria . The preparedness campaign got under way in the winter of 1914-1915 . The leading spirits , chiefly Easterners , included some of the most prominent men in America.20 Preparedness societies sprang up and grew like mushrooms . The most famous of these was the National Security League , organized late in the fall of 1914 , with a notable membership drawn from political , industrial , financial , and professional circles.21 The already existing Navy League acquired new strength and popularity.22 Almost without exception , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ campaign.23 The Army and Navy took a strong stand for preparedness.24 And presently the Administration , reversing its earlier policy , came forward with a great armament program of its own and a supporting propaganda that equalled that of any pressure group in the field . Many other groups , though less active , were none the less in full sympathy with the preparedness movement . In June 1916 , for example , a nation-wide poll of local chambers of commerce and other business groups enrolled in the United States Chamber of Commerce , revealed , among other things , a division of 952 to 10 , in favor of immediate measures " to restore the United States at least to its former position of second naval power in the Atlantic , with surplus in the Pacific sufficient to protect its coasts , its possessions , its trade routes , the Canal Zone , and adjacent territory . " 25 Other business groups went on record to similar effect.26 Organized labor swung into line.27 And what was especially significant , a large segment of the American peace movement cut loose from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new society called the League to Enforce Peace ; adopted a platform foreshadowing the system of collective security later envisaged in the Covenant of the League of Nations ; and endorsed military and naval preparedness as a logical corollary of their program of concerted international action to prevent or if necessary to stop future wars.28 // A great variety of motives impelled men into the preparedness movement . There was , for example , a widespread desire , among both Republicans and Democrats , to capture and to capitalize so stirring an emotional issue for the approaching presidential campaign . " The personnel of some of the most active groups led to public charges that profit , as well as patriotism , was supporting the preparedness campaign.30 Some foresaw that events were driving the United States toward war 31 And countless others flocked to the preparedness standard in a sincere if mistaken belief that the country 's security was immediately at stake . This belief was in large measure a product of the propaganda broadcast over the land during 1915 and 1916 . The directors of this propaganda utilized many vehicles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there were preparedness parades , with bands playing and flags fluttering . Citizens ' training camps were organized , for publicity as well as military training.32 The clergy were solicited to preach sermons on the " duty of preparedness. " 33 Statesmen like Majority Leader Claude Kitchin of the House of Representatives , who opposed a great armament program , were subjected to scurrilous attacks in the press.34 But the most effective of all was the appeal to fear . In // thousands of public speeches , 35 press releases , 3 's books and pamphlets , 37 cinema features , 38 and other vehicles of publicity , the point was hammered home that the American people would sooner or later have to face a merciless foreign enemy at their very threshold.3s This theme recurred again and again . And in the end , the American public rather generally came to believe : that the European Allies , with their backs to the wall , were fighting desperately to save democracy and liberty from the withering blight of Prussian autocracy and militarism ; that the German " war lords , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ British Navy , would then loose their savage , victorious hordes on the republics of the Western Hemisphere ; that a " defenseless America " would suffer the fate of the European democracies ; that the German fleets could quickly and easily destroy our existing Navy , shell our great port cities , and prepare the way for military invasion ; that the German armies , millions strong , would then pour across the Atlantic , land anywhere upon our defenseless coast , brush aside our puny army , and advance at will , destroying our cities , committing unmentionable atrocities , and generally laying waste our fair countryside.4o // Now as a matter of actual fact , it was manifest , both from indisputable data publicly available at that time and from inferences easily and fairly deducible therefrom , that such a sequence of events simply could not occur . It was obvious after the first few weeks of the war , and was repeatedly made clear , that the European conflict would so exhaust all the engaged Powers , as to incapacitate them from menacing the United States for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's radius of operations was rigidly and narrowly limited by the fuel and service requirements of modern warships . And if there were any lingering doubts on this point , they were , or should have been , laid to final rest by the emphatic testimony of Admiral Austin M. Knight , President of the Naval War College . This testimony , given before the House Naval Committee in 1916 , dealt specifically with the difficulties of waging naval war across the Pacific ; but , as members of Congress expressly pointed out , it applied with only slightly less force to naval war in the Atlantic . " It would take me a very long time , " Knight declared , " to go into . . . all the difficulties under which a fleet 7,000 miles from its home ports would labor . Ships break down . Out of a large number of ships a certain number are bound to be crippled in one way or another . The supplies needed to maintain the fleet would be very extensive . Five or six hundred thousand tons of coal would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there . That coal must be delivered and transferred from colliers to ships . It can not be done at sea except under the most favorable possible conditions . It must be done in sheltered waters . The bottoms of the ships would gradually get foul . They ought to have docks where the bottoms can be cleaned . They are subject in their progress over that
