txt Legislation which would block some forms of tax evasion and at the same time discourage the flow of unwanted gold to this country is being considered in Treasury circles . The Congressional tax evasion hearings will result in an increase in the withholding tax against earnings of foreign , capital and collection of this tax will be made more rigid , observers at the hearings believe . An effect of an increase in the tax on foreign capital earnings probably would be to discourage foreign speculation and investment here . In this connection the board of governors of the Federal Reserve System observed in its annual report this week that the investment movement from abroad in the final quarter of 1936 " was the chief factor in the heavy inflow of gold . " Gold is coming into the country , in the opinion of some Treasury officials , first , because of the more stable conditions here , and second , because , as one man put it , " we run a better casino . " Reciprocal Factors In projecting any increase in the tax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the reciprocal aspects of the situation . What , in other words , would be the effect of such a tax increase on American investments abroad ? Since the State Department 's policy is to play fair with foreign countries with respect to taxation , our taxes would have to be on a par with those placed abroad against American investments and earnings . In no event , under the State Department 's policy , could it be discriminatory . The present withholding tax on foreign earnings is 10 per cent for all countries except those contiguous to the United States , in which eases the tax may be not less than 5 per cent , depending upon the reciprocal agreements which the United States maintains with such nations . Canada is already cooperating with the United States in exchanging tax information , and efforts are being made to work out reciprocal agreement with other countries in order that all may better keep track of the foreign earnings of their nationals , according to testimony at the tax-evasion hearing . So many authoritative opinions have recently been made public to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States for gold would have a ruinous effect on fininacial structures here and abroad , that , regardless of whether such would actually be the result of a price change , the psychological attitude of financial leaders everywhere makes such a change virtually prohibitive . Rate of Gold Inflow Under its sterilization policy the United States has bought since December more than $1,000,000,000 worth of gold with borrowed money . It is generally regarded as impossible for the Treasury to go on much longer buying gold at the present price and in the present vole ume . Since a price change seem% out of the question , only the flow can be tampered with . Thus , in the opinion of some Treasury officials , the placing in effect of a tax increase to discourage the heavy gold movement would be extremely desirable , especially if by such an enactment the Treasury also could snare some taxes from evasive citizens . The withholding taxes already affect some wealthy American citizens who have formed foreign corporations which invest in American securities , or who have changed their citizenship to evade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the past week . Treasury officials suggested at the hearings an increase in the withholding tax on income received from this country by non-resident individuals and foreign corporations . One report stated that should the withholding tax be advanced to 25 per cent taxpayers abroad might receive the choice of paying that levy or ordinary domestic income taxes , in which event they might elect to pay the regular taxes . Another aspect of the gold situation to which Treasury officials have been giving some consideration is that gold , which originally gained its position of eminence in finance through its function as currency , is no longer domestically convertible in most of the countries of the world . Views of World Bank The annual report of the Bank for International Settlements gave consideration to this aspect of the problem in the following language : " It has also been suggested that gold coins should again be put in circulation .

There would certainly be no increase in the commercial banks ' balances at the central bank so long as the gold went into circulation , but the new coins - when not hoarded might also constitute an addition to the existing volume of purchasing power , while gold production would not be reduced . " It is pertinent to remember that in the years before the war , when gold was effectively in circulation to an extent that it would be difficult to attain again , the increase in the South African gold production brought about an appreciable rise in prices . " A high Treasury official recently stated that consideration was being given to all methods and suggestions for relieving the heavy flow of gold to this country and that no one course has as yet been decided upon . ices and in causing offerings of ares frequently to decrease with ing prices . oreigners , on the other hand , n liquidate at the - first sign of ouble at the trifling penalty of a per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is safearded by the fact that large erican investors are inhibited om following suit because of the iff tax penalties they face . p s Fear Abroad Is a Factor An increase in the withholding tax on foreign investments in this country would act as a deterrent , but not as a complete bar , to the flow of gold from abroad , in the opinion of Wall Street bankers and economists who discussed last night the report that the Treasury is planning such an action . The gold now flowing into the United States at the rate of about $150,000,000 a month is coming partly because of the fears of foreigners for the safety of their capital at home and partly in expectation of profits here . To the extent that fear of loss at home motivates the flight of capital , taxes would have to be raised sharply to act as an effective check to the movement , bankers here felt . But a moderate increase in the withholding tax might be sufficient to cut down that part of the capital influx which comes chiefly for investment and speculation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was felt , might at least serve to divert the flow of capital partly toward other countries , thereby helping to distribute the burden of absorbing the increased new gold production of the world and the huge amounts of gold that are being dehoarded . As matters now stand , almost the entire task of taking up the new supplies of gold coming into the world market is falling upon the United States . Not a Complete Solution The proposal to increase the taxes levied upon foreign capital invested here has been under discussion among Treasury experts for several months . It has been recognized , however , as a measure that would be difficult to apply effectively and as one which , while helpful , did not provide a complete solution of the gold problem . That it is now being actively considered may be a sign , it was remarked here last night , that the Treasury experts are despairing of finding a more effective remedy for the gold problem . The influx of gold to the United States in recent years , which has amounted to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 31 , 1934 , is the outward sign of a huge transfer of capital . It is estimated that roughly $8,000 , - 000,000 of foreign money is now invested here , of which about $6,000 , - 000,000 is in long-term or fixed investments , with the remainder in short-term funds . Apart from its influence upon the gold problem , however , the suggestion of an increase in the tax withheld at the source here on foreigners ' security profits has received much support from bankers lately on the ground that the present tax structure gives undue favor to foreigners over American investors and speculators . Foreigners Have Advantage The 10 per cent tax withheld on the profits of foreigners , except Canadians , who pay only 5 per cent , is very much less , financiers here have contended , than the taxes which large American investors have to pay . The result of this discrimination , they have contended , has been to make our stock market liquid for foreigners but illiquid for domestic investors . The fact that capital gains are taxed like income under our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deterring large investors from taking profits freely in the stock market , it is argued . This , it has been charged , is a factor in bringing about unreasonable rises in stock
