txt COOPERATION THE BIG NEED Trade Associations Could Do Much to Lift the Depression . To the Editor of The New York Timea : General William W. Atterbury , president of the Pennsylvania Railroad , says that one of the greatest needs of the country in the present economic crisis is for industrial leadership . He suggests " a council of Susiness men cooperating with the United States Government " to inquire into the causes of the existing industrial situation and recommend concerted action to bring about measures of relief and improvement . Nearly all writers on economic subjects of late have stressed the lack of leadership among commercial interests , not only on this continent but in the world at large , and have prayed for a Moses to lead the people out of the present conditions of depression and want . The cause of the existing crisis may have been overspeculation , overproduction and underdistribution , but , as Mark Twain once said about the weather , " every one talks about it and nobody does anything about it . " Many remedial measures  --  mostly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the Government of the United States and other governments to undertake , but it is not clear that any of them would do more than take money from one pocket to put it into another and to increase the already too heavy burden of taxation . Many of them , in fact , suggest doles and subsidies , either directly or in disguise , and would offer no permanent reliefq-ite the reverse , in fact . Any improvement in industry , in commerce , in agriculture , must be brought about by the interests directly concerned , with the cooperation of labor and that section of the consuming public which has money to spend . The burden of initiative lies largely , if not principally , with associations of producers and marketers in the various fields , and it is among them that leaders must be found . What is any association doing to meet this need ? Members of trade associations may well ask themselves that question . A suggestion from any one of them to the directors or governing board of his own organization may start a movement @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that " the busiest of living agents are certain dead men 's thoughts . " Why not have a few ideas from live ones ? C. A. TUPPER . Chicago , Ill. , June 2 , 1931 . Condemnation Awards . To the Edttor of The New York Times : May I say a word anent your editorial " School Sites " ? There is only one way to prevent the city from being " stung " on condemnation awards . The only remedy is a constitutional amendment that no court can grant an award in excess of 25 per cent over the average of the previous three years ' assessed valuations . The assessed valuation of practically every parcel of real estate is grossly overvalued from a net income basis  --  the only true basis of value . It 's assessed at future potential values . This is done for the city 's budget necessities . This bill I drafted and it was introduced in the 1931 Legislature , but because I was in the hospital from February to the end of April it was not pushed . The bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
