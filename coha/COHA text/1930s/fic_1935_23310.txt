NIGHT WATCH A STORY BY OLIVER LA FARGE G OOSE ISLAND , flat , sandy , and gray in the stormy dusk , broke the wind . The catboat slid into quiet waters of its harbor as though the little vessel sighed and relaxed gratefully . The tightness in the pit of Arthur 's stomach let go ; he was sure of himself again , relieved of a too great strain as he picked a spot clear of rocks , lulled , and beached her gently . There was the strange , complete cessation of motion and the cold wind whistling as he made all snug . " We may have to stay here overnight , " he said , fearful of the protests Sally would make . " Old Eben Water-man 's shack 's just behind the trees . " She nodded . " All right . I suppose it ca n't be helped . Mother will worry . " Evidently the pounding they had come through had impressed her , little though she knew of boats . That was some comfort . " I guess mine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea . It ought to blow out by morning . We could n't do anything else . " " No . And really , Arthur , you handled her very well . " He made no answer . Her praise was not valid , and also inadequate . For a solid hour he had been contemplating imminent death , knowing that the storm was beyond the boat 's capacity , his physical strength stretched to the utmost . He could n't explain that , any more than he could tell her that Waterman was a disreputable old poacher or make clear his humiliation at having let an older girl talk him into putting forth when he really knew better . The shelter which awaited them was dingy , no place for a girl . He was at odds with himself and the situation , tired , cold , lonely , oppressed by continuing responsibility beyond his years of having a girl on his hands , when his condition made him wish to sink back toward the little boy he so recently had been . Finishing the last coil of rope , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well go . " They climbed out . He carried the grapnel inland and hooked it against a rock , with the line taut . There were two other boats in the cove , Water-man 's old sloop at anchor and a dirty , heavy power-dory beached near their own vessel . Arthur did not recognize her . They followed a path through beach-grass , over low dunes to a scattered growth of bay , thorn-apple , and wild cherry , stunted , twisted , and looking cold in the little remaining day . light . Now the storm reached them again , nearly full force . They could hear the seas pound on the windward side of the little island . Waterman 's shanty showed two orange lighted windows ahead of them , a jumble of irregular , tar-paper extensions on a shingled center , a round pipe chimney , and at one side a pile of lobster-pots almost as big as the house . " Goodness , it looks like a smuggler 's den . " Sally shivered . " But I 'll be glad to get in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're almost castaways , are n't we ? " The romanticism seemed ill-timed . " He 's an old poacher , shiftless you know , " Arthur said . Waterman might be drunk ; there was no telling . Arthur knew him only as a man who had endless time for boys ? little boys of ten and twelve  --  when he came to town , kindly and wise in many things , especially the sea . When one was older , recognizing his raggedness , his reputation , one saw less of him . Drunks were vague figures to Arthur 's mind , seen on streets or in trolley cars , an evil terror about them . They said Waterman got drunk often . Then what to do ? He braced himself . The wind hummed around the shanty , making it tremble . Arthur knocked , was shamed by the betraying weakness of his first blow , then struck the door hard . He knew he was afraid of what had not yet happened , what might not happen . He seemed cowardly to himself . This was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door opened , the rich light within showing the old fisherman as he peered at them , a large man , stooped , unshaven , in dirty , heavy trousers and checked shirt . They noticed his wide , hard hands , hooked permanently ready for ropes . " By gracious , " he said , " it 's Arthur . Come in , boy , and you , young lady . Storrnbaound , I reckon ? " He stood aside to let them step into the thick , warm air within  --  a room with a table and chairs , a stove , a lamp , odd bits of gear , old sails , nets , unwashed dishes , oilskins , an oar , a barrel ? a room too small for all it contained , so that even when one moved in theclear space in the center one felt the need to dodge and step high . Another big man , slouched in a chair tipped against the wall , looked at them with dull curiosity . He had fair hair , a heavy , stupid , vacuous , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ throat and red neck rising from his open shirt-collar . At the sight of Sally he rose slowly to his feet , his expression faintly livened . Waterman looked about him with a smile . " Quite a party for this old island . This here 's John Whitin ' . " Arthur said , " This is Miss Lane , Mr. Waterman . " The oId man bowed slightly . " Pleased to know ye . Set daown and make yourselves to home . We 're fixin ' a chaowder , I reckon there 's a plenty for us all . " They found seats . Waterman took a place near the stove , where he could watch the brew preparing there . His eyes were lively , humorous in their deep , wrinkled setting . " Ye put int ' the cove ? " he asked . " Yes . We had to run for it . " " In the Spindrift ? " " Yes . " " Ye 'd ought to ' ye known better , day like this and so late in the year . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl had put him up to it , that he 'd let his judgment go because it flattered him when she addressed him as she did the older boys . " Reckon ye 'll have to spend the night here at Eben 's hotel , " Whiting said in a deep voice . " I will too , I guess . It 's narsty aout and makin ' up thick . " Arthur disliked this man on sight . Something jarring , aggressive about him . He merely nodded in answer . " Ought to moderate by mornin ' , " Eben Waterman said . " Aiyes , some . What kind o ' vessel ye got , boy ? " " A catboat . " " One o ' them little matchboxes I see in Qunnochaug harbor ? " " She 's small , but she 's sturdy . " Arthur bristled . Whiting nodded and smiled tolerantly . " I know ' em . give ye a tow home in the mornin ' . The young lady can ride with me . Be more amusin ' for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Arthur squirmed inwardly while he waited for Sally 's answer . " I think I 'll go with Arthur , thank you . He 's a good sailor . " Whiting smiled , showing big uneven white teeth . " Spunky , " he said . " Jest fine . Lady like you 'd ought to take up with a real sailor . " Eben rose . " John , wash up some o ' them dishes . Arthur , you and Miss Lane mought set the table with sech as ye can find . Chaowder 's most ready . " The situation dissolved , but while they cleared the table and arranged the dishes , Arthur thought hard . Whiting was bad , mean . He 'd like to make trouble . The kind of men who catcalled after girls and sometimes , while they loafed about the docks , said nasty things to boys to see if they understood them . He was unusually aggressive for a countryman . And Waterman would be little or no help . He was responsible , he wanted to do his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were grown . How ? That big man . He felt baffled , useless , disgracefully childish . Sally talked to Waterman as though nothing were amiss  --  more , she was acting toward the ragged old man just as she did toward college boys , with that smiling attention , all those girl 's tricks . He knew them , saw them with new completeness . When I grow up 1 ' 11 never fall for that . Now , of all times ! Eben was eating it up ton , wise though the fisherman had always seemed . The chowder , served with pilot biscuit , was very good . At first everyone was absorbed in eating , then Whiting , the edge off his first hunger , became over-solicitous in passing Sally biscuits , coffee , sugar , salt . Almost immediately she reopened her play with Waterman . Arthur began to suspect that there was reason in her behavior . A girl could n't know what he did about rough men , but she would probably have an instinct . The old man responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how one brings down ducks by lantern-light , " they come in so 's ye could kill ' em with a hat-pin " ? and by that route , to storms . Arthur felt he should help keep the ball rolling  --  Sally included him and so did Waterman  --  but he could n't . Fatigue and inner discomfort froze his thoughts , he was sunk fathoms deep in wordlessness , nervous and ill at ease . He glanced sidelong at the big man across from him with his bold eyes and loutish look . He wished they were well out of this . Whiting laughed with talk-drowning boisterousness at one of Eben 's remarks . " Yessir , that 's true by Gard . Reminds me of a time I was to Montevideo . " He seized the conversation by main force . He was a blue-water sailor , he said ; fishing just now as a makeshift . " I ai n't a-stayin ' raound Rhode Island , not when I know them foreign parts . No sir . The girls here is too dull for a man like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you show it to ' em . And it 's too close here . I 've traveled , I have , and seen plenty . I ai n't a man to he cooped up . Naow in Noo Orleens one time . Arthur thought the tale which followed scandalous , doubly so since it was levelled right at Sally , a grotesque form of showing off . He could see the girl turn cold , her eyes downcast . Eben cut a plug of tobacco , pulled an empty box near him with his foot , spat into it , and sat back as though he were enjoying the show . Whiting ran on , delighted in himself . The storms he 'd been through  --  he 'd seen hurricanes , he had , he knew the sea . He detailed , boastful , improbable ; aiming obvious , crude side-blows at college-boy summer sailors . Arthur sat with clenched hands , eyes on plate , despairing . What could he do ? Eben cleared his throat tremendously , spat , coughed , and said , " Wall , wall , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ third saga . " Too bad ye was never in sail , John . " " Haow ? " Whiting flushed deeply . " Too bad ye was never in sail . Them steamers is awful cranky in a blow . " " Why  --  uh  --  hell , sure I ben in sail . " " Have ye ? I had n't realized . " Eben 's tone was still mild , with gentle surprise . " Sail makes a difference . In my time , I sailed clear to Chiny , more'n oncet , the Horn and the Cape o ' Good Hope and the North Atlantic and all , but if ye want danger at sea , gim me a small boat right in these here waters . I mind me one time I had a little sloop , the Lizzie H. , and was headin ' for P'int Judy . Wall , it come on to blow aout the no'thcast , and to blow , and then to blow . Thick too . I had to run under the bare pole finally ; had to go right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . I was alone , but young then and handy . It got dark and wet , and I could look daown int ' the cabin to a pot o ' stew on my stove , and I did n't dast leave the stick long enough to go daown and gilt it . A beamy little boat she was , but sweet to handle . Newport-built . She 's ben bruk up these twenty years . " Wall , by-and-by the marst alone was too much for her to carry , and she commenced laborin ' somethin ' awful . So I took th'axe and cut the shraouds and the pole went over , bruk off right flush with the deck . Left her stripped clean , ye see ; so then I lost steerage way and she broached to . So I druv a marlin spike into what the marst had ben , stickin ' up abaout a foot . She sailed nice with that , and when the tempest got worse I 'd jest fetch the spike a tap with th'axe , drive it in another inch , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn , and beat into the harbor to windward under the label tore off the inside o ' my oilskin breeches . " " Wall , let 's tidy up . " Whiting had been nicely deflated . Arthur could see that he was angry without being able to take open offense . " Ye got any rum ? " the young man asked . " I do n't guess I have . Jug 's empty , " Eben answered . " Bet ye have . Ye most generally do . " Whiting opened a locker , then another , and brought out a jug . " Here ye be , Ehen . Jest the thing for a stormy evenin ' . " " Wall , by gracious , did n't know there was any left . " Whiting rinsed mugs and set them on the table . " Have a drink , Miss Lane ? " " No , thank you . " " Ye 'd ought to try some , it 'd do ye good . You 're a grown lady , ye should commence to live . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I do n't like it . " " Boy , have ye lamed to drink yet ? Big little man , hey ? " " No thanks . " " Eben , I do n't need ask ye . " " That 's right . " Sally and Arthur took chairs against the wall , close together . The boy could hardly look at her . He saw that she was glad to have him near-by , but what did it prove ? This was what he had feared . He thrust his clenched hands into his pockets , wondering whether , in a pinch , he could brain Whiting with a chair or find a knife to use . He could throw one pretty well , his elder brother had taught him . The two men poured drinks  --  Whiting took a brimming mug  --  said , " here 's how , " and drank . Whiting emptied his at a gulp ; shortly he began to talk more rapidly , addressing Eben but eyeing Sally . After the second round his voice was louder and he seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his voice thickened , blurred . " It ai n't goin ' to your head already ? " Whiting asked . " Seems so . I 'm gittin ' old , I guess . Head 's feeble , and this here 's strong rum . " Whiting laughed . " I 've drunk a quart right daown and only jest ben started . In Havany one time . . . " Eben rose , lurching , to get his plug . The boy visualized clearly drunkenness and riot . Fragments of things heard , books , Stevenson  --  the messy little cabin with its oil light , the many sea-goods piled round , was an indicated setting for murder , assault . Rape , the word forced itself at him , an appalling concept . His mouth was dry and his palms sweated . There was a big knife by the sink . If I can get to that . I 'll say I want water . Returning , Eben stumbled , hit the table , and his outstretched arm sent the jug crashing down onto an anchor just beneath . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Whiting leaped up , shouting , " Jesus , ye damn fool ! " " Oh my goodness , " Eben lamented , " oh my goodness , it 's all gone . Landed right on that mud-hook . Oh my goodness . " He sat down heavily . " Clumsy old fool . " Stooping , Whiting retrieved a curved shard from which he poured a last mugful of the liquor . " Here 's somethin ' . " He drank it down . " Your head 's weak all right . " The old man , clumsy and stumbling , picked up the pieces and mopped the floor . " Reckon we 'd all better turn in , " he said . " Party 's plumb spiled . " Whiting seemed about to object , then he thought of something . His eyes darted quickly toward the boy and Sally . " Might 's well . " " Miss Lane , there 's the bedroom in there . John , you can have the storeroom yander ; plenty sails , I reckon . Arthur , you and me 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Mr. Waterman , " Sally said . Arthur nodded , and their eyes met . He too felt it was best to stay on watch . " That 's right , " Whiting said . " Let the old man and the boy turn in . You and me 'll set up a spell . " Arthur waited . The girl seemed to have no answer . " Ought to be calm shortly after sunrise , " Eben announced , " and ye'lI be wantin ' to start early . Best turn in . " " That 's right , " the girl replied , " I think I will go to bed . Good-night . " Eben and Arthur said , " Goodnight . " Whiting grinned unpleasantly . Through the thin wall they could hear the girl shoot the bolt in her outside door , then drag something heavy against the one into the kitchen . Whiting looked over at the two others as though making a calculation . " Wall , good-night , " he said and went into the storeroom . Eben indicated one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Arthur . " The drunken sound had left his voice . The boy said , " I 'm thirsty , " and crossed to the sink . He took a long drink and sighed . Eben , still standing , watched him . " Nice knife you 've got . " He picked it up . " Aiyes . Put it back . " Arthur hesitated , obeyed . Eben was against them then ; the jug had been an accident . The old man smiled . " D'ye know hauw to clean a gun ? " " Yes . " The question was surprising . What now ? " Ye might lend me a hand . Duck season 's started , and I 'm plannin ' to git me some . " Eben took two shotguns and a box of materials from a locker . Handing Arthur one , he seated himself in the second comfortable chair , on the opposite side of the table , cradling the other . " Ye'lI find rags and all there , and the rod 's in the corner . " Pulling up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have loaded it and regretted the necessity of taking the weapon apart . Eben seemed to be acting according to a plan . " That 's right ; my fingers is kind ce stiff for sech work . This here now , " he patted the worn hammerlock in his hands , " my daddy give it to me when I was a boy . She 's still good . I keep her loaded . " He opened the breech , showed the shells , and snapped it shut with a resonant click which must have been audible throughout the house , for all the continued tearing of wind outside . ' ' Many a goose I bagged with her before they had all these dumb laws . Still do , times when my luck 's in . Too many laws we got . Now they talk abaout forbiddin ' rum , but the country wo n't never stand for it . " His talk ran on , amiable , easy , garrulous , and interesting . Since he was quite little Arthur had liked to listen to him ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he thought that some of the sea stories were lies , but he listened , and his tenseness slackened . When he had done a good job removing the last of the few rust spots , he said , " There ! " and put the gun together . " Stick it in the closet , boy . " Arthur hesitated . Eben said very quietly , in a different voice , " Guns can be serious . Serious things is what we 're airnin ' to avoid right naow . You 're all right , boy , but put it away . " Arthur obeyed and sat down again . He felt drowsy . There was the orange lamp flame , the heat of the stove , the old man slouched in his chair with his over-long , old cannon across the arms of it , the nasal , easy voice with its thick accent continuing : a . blowin ' so cold I up-ended my skiff to make a windbreak , and the birds comin ' dtivin ' past in the flyin ' snow . I 'd have to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ geese and duck and teal , went by , and then I 'd shoot again . I war n't more'n your age , and in them days things was plentiful . . " Arthur 's attention wandered . Conservation , his father 's opinions . .. under six inches we put ' em on the fields for fertilizer . I seen the skip-jack craowdin ' into Narrow River so 's they jammed at the bridge and had to mill and jump over one another to git on upstream . One time me and Eliphalet Calhoun . . . " A very bad thing had been held off for a long time , but he 'd thrown away his talisman , and now terror had caught up with him . He opened his eyes suddenly . Eben slept in his chair , still holding the gun . The lamp burned the same , with a tiny humming noise , the storm pounded outside . The place was changed , lonely , secret . Whiting 's door was slowly opening ; the man showed behind it , he came into the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his head turned cautiously about , the pale-blue eyes met Arthur 's . Without hesitation a big arm shot out to clamp rough fingers about the boy 's throat . " One yip aout o ' ye , ye little bastard - ? . " Arthur felt his insides melt and fall away as he stared at Whiting 's face , receiving the hot , liquor-heavy breath . The man removed his hand , eyed the boy , grinned , and straightening , tiptoed with painful caution round the table , toward Eben . I 've got to wake him . I ca n't . I must . He 'll kill me . I must . He 'll get the gun , that 's ruin . Must . Must . Agonizingly nerving himself , he tried to shout , producing a mouselike , futile murmur : " Eben . " Whiting whirled round . " Ebel-1r he called shrilly . Whiting stepped toward him ; he cowered . Eben snorted , moved . The big man looked over his shoulder , muttered something at the boy , and slipped back into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door softly . Waterman looked about him . " What  --  I must ha ' snoozed . D'ye call ? " Arthur still felt limp , his mouth dry . He jerked his head toward Whiting 's door . " D'he come in ? " Eben asked softly . Arthur nodded . " I vow ! " Well awake now , the fisherman studied the boy . " Ye look upset . He threatened ye ? " Arthur nodded again . " Move your chair over here . We might talk a bit . See if there 's any coffee left ; a spot would set well . " Arthur hefted the pot , and poured them each a half-cupful . " That 's all . " " It 'll do . Hark at that wind aoutside ; notice it 's kind o ' puffy naow ? Lets up times ? It 's beginnin ' to blow itself aout . " He cut himself a chew . " Puts me in mind o ' one time I visited with Jack Palmer , when he was tendin ' Whale Rock Light @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Every time one o ' them big waves bruk over the rock , she fair danced , andeverything below decks rattled . I arsked him , did n't he mind it , and he says no , it was the quiet nights bothered him worse . Lighthaouse-keepers gits funny sometimes , if they 're too much alone . They was a Dutchman in the Malay Straits one time . . . " Eben was reaching back into the wide seas of his youth , fishing up matter certain to hold a boy 's attention in spite of himself , to occupy his mind . The drag of recent fright let go as Arthur listened , fascinated and wakeful . The Malay Straits , the Yellow Sea , the Far North  --  Russian revenue cutters and the sealing trade . The old man paused and sighed . " I seen plenty , I done plenty , some good , some bad . I was pretty bad as a youth , I guess . Got a good bit o ' meanness in my system still . As I was , so I acted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't fool myself none , and I was smart enough to be thorough and able at whatever foolishness I started . But him , naow , " he jerked his head toward the storeroom , " his trouble is he 's tryin ' to be bad . He never did have narthin ' under his thatch anyway . Even if he 's ben to all the places he 's laid tongue to , he ai n't never ben nowhere . Nor never will . The little life he 's seen in ports has given him one-eighth of an idee abaout himself ; and bein ' as he 's narthin ' but a bull in human form anyway , he jest keeps on a buttin ' along that way . A deck-hand , that 's all  --  ye look at a man like that and figger if he stays aout o ' jail he 'll wind up in a squatter 's shanty . Not like me , because I like to make my own haours and my own rules and I love my own company , but because there jest ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He 's half-seas-over naow and spoilin ' for a fight , but I guess one way or another ' we 'll aoutsmart him . " Arthur listened without comment , feeling new trust in his companion , re-assured of his capacity and awareness . He could see that what he said was true . But a bull can be dangerous ; this man was so big . " When I was boatswain on the barque Pleiades , there was an Irish feller before the mast , I remember . . . " Eben 's voice was pitched low , almost whispering , giving his talk a confidential , intimate quality . No other sound competed against the storm  --  he owned no clock . The night glided by . Sharp and clear , startling , Sally 's voice cried , " Who 's that ? " They heard her outside door rattle as it was shaken hard , and stiffening to attention , heard Whiting 's answer from beyond it . " It 's me , John . I want to talk with ye . " The door rattled again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Lane , give me a chance . I 'm thinkin ' and thinkin ' of ye , and I got to talk with ye . Do n't be scairt of me . All ye know is them college boys , and maybe I seem rough , but I 'm all right . I 'm real . . . " A hard puff of wind drowned out his voice . Eben nodded . " Ye see ? He believes in stories . He reads them cheap magazines with the showy colors , and he listens to lies in the forecastle , and by gum , he thinks it 's life . Pathetic . " They heard him again , in snatches , and again Sally 's clear , frightened , " Go away . It 's too late at night to talk now . " " Naow 's jest the time . Do n't ye be frightened . Ye ai n't never lived , that 's what 's ailin ' ye . Leave me show ye . Let yourself be bad , girl , and commence to live . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Arthur squirmed in his chair . " Mr. Waterman ? " he began , and choked . He felt himself tremble , was sure that he was white . " Right ye are , boy , it 's too hard on the lady , though she ai n't a-goin ' to take no harm from it . We 'll fix it in a minute . " Reaching for an oily rag , he dabbed at an invisible rust spot on his gun . He seemed to meditate , then he grinned and raised his bead , speaking in a loud voice . " Sets me in mind of a Cape Cod man called Tewitt was courtin ' a Spanish lady in Callao . " His voice was that of a man giving orders aboard ship , not shouting , but every word clearly carrying through the thin shanty walls . Whiting 's appeal ceased . " Tewitt was aoutside one o ' them barred , Spanish windows , ye know , and the lady inside was tryin ' to git some sleep . Wall , he went on and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lady , she up and called aout : " ' Papa , ' she yells , ' papa , there 's somethin ' aout here smells like a lobster-crate and talks like an ape , what 'll I do abaout it ? ' " And her pa , he answers , ' Likely it 's some durned net-robber got adrift in deep water . Put a cake o ' soap on the window-sill and he 'll run a mile . ' " Eben laughed deeply , then they sat silent . Soon enough they heard Whiting return to the storeroom . Sally 's door opened , and she came in , a trifle pale but with a spark of amusement in her eyes . " Come right in , Miss Lane , and set with us . We was wakeful , sort of , and I ben tryin ' to git the rust off'n this old gun o ' mine . " He scrubbed with the rag as he spoke . " That 's right , make yourself easy . " " I do n't feel sleepy either . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was jest tellin ' the boy ' baout the big storm of ' 86 . I had a schooner then , tradin ' garden-truck and sech , and I was comin ' up from Block Island .. . " Arthur listened at first , then he meditated . The whole situation became clear to him , he took its pattern into himself , gravely adding to his structure , his growth  --  the precarious balance which an old man maintained between humor , absurdity , and a loaded shotgun , the trouble eased aside each time . Not at all like the books , but there was something of Jim Hawkins in his own part . Perhaps a boy can not be a man , but he can be the best of what there is in boys . He had had a part , and no slight one . Eben had used him , from their first arrival when he felt so alone and helpless . Eben had been using him right along for this end , wisely planning and fore-seeing . That was something to remember . Waterman rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the night . " Dawn comin ' , " he said , " and not more than a reef breeze naow . " He cocked his head , listening . " John 's pullin ' aout ; there 's his motor star tin ' , Seems so he could n't wait for breakfast . We 'll fix a mess o ' fish , and pretty soon it 'll be light , and with the wind droppin ' so , jest fine for yachtin ' . Will ye rinse the coffee pot , Miss Lane ? " As he walked to the storeroom for supplies he paused by Arthur . " You 're all right , boy , ye 'll do fine .
