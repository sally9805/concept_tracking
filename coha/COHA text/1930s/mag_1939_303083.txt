Under stress at high temperatures ( 750-1,000 F. ) , most metals , even hard alloy steels , manifest a sort of internal slip or " creep . " To prevent costly machine failures and ugly accidents , metallurgists have long studied , measured and allowed for creep , but they still do not know much about what fundamentally happens . <P> Last week the metallurgical journal Metal Progress commented on the researches of Professor Daniel Hanson of England 's University of Birmingham , who had divided creep into four stages . These are elastic stretch ( like rubber ) ; plastic flow ( like mud ) ; slower plastic flow ; approach to fracture . Professor Hanson 's theory of fracture is that the metal atoms , under continuing mechanical stress plus their own agitation due to heat , are moved one by one to new positions so that the whole structure is weakened . When enough atoms are thus individually moved , the metal breaks .
