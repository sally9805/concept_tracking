" It is a fair guess that Franklin D. Roosevelt is in very fact the most important American educator of today . More people have recently been studying about the Supreme Court than ever before , not even excepting the time of the Dred Scott decision . " <P> So spoke venerable William Heard Kilpatrick , just retired by Columbia 's Teachers College and now at Northwestern University , at the 75th or " diamond " convention of the National Education Association in Detroit last week . As 1,300 delegates and 12,000 vacationing NEA members crowded warmly into the Masonic Temple to begin four days of talk about their profession , no one was more on teachers ' minds than the President of the U. S. He had just signed a new NEA charter which democratized the board of directors by dropping from it the Association 's 22 past presidents , mostly school superintendents and long a thorn to rebellious classroom teachers . And he had sent Chairman Floyd W. Reeves of his Advisory Committee on Education to tell the NEA just how good a friend of Education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Federal Government spent over $21,800,000 to keep rural schools open in 1934 and 1935 , loaned $84,271,000 through the PWA and spent another $213,832,000 outright for school buildings and repairs up to the end of 1936 . The National Youth Administration had 435,000 needy students on its lists , WPA had given work to 42,000 unemployed teachers , there have been 1,500,000 youngsters in the CCC . To NEA , however , this tale of generosity did not atone for the fact that the Association 's pet Harrison-Black-Fletcher bill , providing Federal school subsidies up to $300,000,000 a year to the States , was sidetracked this year by the President when he sent his economy message to Congress . Ohio 's fiery Representative Brooks Fletcher appeared at the convention to complain : <P> " When the richest nation on earth permits seven million-nearly a third-of its school children to be taught by a quarter million teachers who receive less than $750 a year , and 30,000 poverty-stricken teachers who receive less than $450 a year , there is need for an awakening of civic pride in the discharge of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resolved to plump for the Harrison-Black-Fletcher bill , encouraged NEA 's adult education section to strike Congress for another $25,000,000 to eradicate illiteracy .
