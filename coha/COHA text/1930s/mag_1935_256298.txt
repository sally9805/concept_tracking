The Treaty of Versailles forbids Germany to possess submarines or war planes . Herr Hitler has tacitly admitted possession of an air force ( TIME , March 4 ) . Last week the naval correspondent of London 's carefully conservative Morning Post did not say that Germany has any actual submarines , but he did affirm that she has an excellent new type of undersea boat on drafting boards and in the brains of capable designers . Special advantage of this blueprint craft is that it needs no storage batteries for submerged propulsion . <P> Operation of this theoretical submarine depends on a fact familiar to high-school chemistry students-that water separates into its component gases when an electric current is passed through it , hydrogen collecting on the negative pole , oxygen on the positive . While under way on the surface the submarine 's engines burn a mixture of oil and hydrogen , have enough reserve power to drive an electric generator . This generator furnishes current to an electrolyzer which turns water into hydrogen and oxygen under pressure . The excess hydrogen and all the oxygen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dives , the oil supply to the engines is cut off and they are fed from the tanks with oxygen and hydrogen . The explosive recombination of oxygen and hydrogen into water releases energy . Because of the engine temperature this exhaust water is in the form of superheated steam . All the steam is condensed inside the submarine . Hence no gases leave the ship to betray it by telltale bubbles on the surface .
