txt PLAYGROUNDS IN THE PARK . There Are Reasons Why More of Them Would Be Undesirable . To the Editor of Tho New York Times : . The letter of Charles Ide 's in THE TIMES of July 27 is interesting reading . His feeling that the people in New York are not provided - with enough playgrounds in Central Park is a natural one , but it would seem that he does not view this matter of using the grass on the several meadows in a practical manner . When I was a youngster , with the population of New York below one million , the present sheep meadow along the western side of the park was a playground for baseball , and it was not then , in the early ' 70s , used by so many thousand of boys as it would be in our present day . The authorities are well aware of this probability and know that if the meadows were thrown open to the tens of thousands , the park would soon be , in a fair way , comparable to Tompkins and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ugly and unsightly . In the early ' 80s the north meadows were opened to tennis players , and during that period the players did not destroy the grass , but in later years , with the increasing influx of the proletariat , the permits to use the meadows were withdrawn . as the grass was almost destroyed . The signs " Keep Off the Grass " are absolutely essential if we desire to continue having a real park . Mr. Ide says , " It needs more fields and meadows and fewer lawns . It needs more of what this country stands for and does not have much of  --  freedom . " Central Park Is the only stretch of green this city has in its residential part and should be rigidly maintained as such , notwithstanding the fact that there are a limited number of playgrounds . Theoretically , the idea that more playgrounds and more meadows should be made for the use of the people is quite commendable , but practically it is out of the question , and the Park Commissioner undoubtedly knows it and so do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELISHA FLAGG . New York , July 29 , 1930 . Reason for Restrictions . To the Editor of The New York Times : Charles Ide , who finds so many restrictions in Central Park , according to his letter to THE TIMES , perhaps in his zeal to find proof for specific contentions seems to have met with many rebuffs from policemen , or to have seen others meet with such rebuffs . This picture of Central Park seems strange to one who has spent hundreds of hours in this happy land of the city children , and has enjoyed watching all kinds of joyous play on the despised cement walks under the shade of trees without any kind of interference from police whatever . In my opinion , the great fault in this discussion about the use of the reservoir site is the failure to realize that both sides are aiming at the happiness and health of poor children and adults , but both have not apparently studied the child at play scientifically , to be able to prove what is the really best environment for the happiest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demand , wide freedom was allowed in the use of grass . This resulted in large tracts of ugly dirt , which were finally made green again only after high boy-proof fences had been put around the various plots for a long enough period for new grass to grow . It is not quite fair to keep up the argument that the park is wanted merely as " scenery " by the wealthy , when no attempt has ever been made to keep out children or any poor person . Regulations made have been necessary to protect the " freedom " of law-abiding citizens against those who would carelessly injure the park . MABEL E. MACOMBER , President , City Playground League . New York , July 29 , 1930 . Concrete and Earthquakes . To the Editor of The New York Times : THE TIMES of July 25 contained an article to the effect that the loss of life in the recent Italian earthquake was largely due to the use of masonry in building construction , and the inference that reinforced concrete was , an almost positive preventive against building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deny the good qualities of reinforced concrete properly designed and constructed or of any dependable building material , it is , nevertheless , a fact that the use of reinforced concrete is not of itself assurance against collapse during earthquakes and similar disturbances . I would refer to the partial collapse of the San Marcos Building in the Santa Barbara quake , to the damage done to reinforced concrete in the Masonic Temple in the same disaster and to the almost complete destruction of the Arlington Hotel . A. S. Mitchell , in the October , 1929 , issue of The Journal of the New Zealand Institute of Architects , commenting on the seismic disturbance in June , 1929 , says : " * * * No evidence has been forthcoming as to the superiority of concrete ( plain or reinforced ) over well-built brick walls , as has been contended by some authorities , mostly American . * * * " R.

To the Editor of The New York Times @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York " ? so Hobart College is called in Mr. Jewett 's interesting letter in your issue of July 27 . Hobart College ought to have the endowment which it is seeking . But in 1818 , four years before Hobart 's date , Auburn Theological Seminary was founded . It was in Western New York as much as Hobart , Auburn being twenty-five miles east of Geneva . It was an " instituti'on for higher learning , " all its students being college graduates . Auburn Seminary was established in pioneer days , to meet the intellectual and religious needs of the frontier . I The right of its founders to their Iplace in history must be maintained .
