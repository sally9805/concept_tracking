OUR hat , our high hat , goes off to Sears , Roebuck &; Company for their adoption of the thirteen-month calendar . The millpond of business will have its placidity disturbed now , in a most charming way . Gradually the firms which use the thirteen-month system will begin to gain on the other firms , and on the populace . Sears Roebuck are already four or five days up on us . Popular song writers are working on a new lyric : " When it 's Sunday in Sears Roebuck , it 's only Wednesday in Rogers Peet . " Personally , we enjoy the uneasy feeling that a business house is gaining on us  --  it makes us restless , and we work better when we are restless . One friend of ours , however , has run up against one of the situations that will inevitably arise in the thirteen-month calendar  --  he ordered a pair of skis from Sears Roebuck , forgetting that it was getting well along into springtime in that organization . He has n't received the skis yet , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't send roller-skates , on their own initiative . WE retain a fairly well-hung pessimism about the theatre-ticket situation . The managers , tearful at the evils of ticket speculation , are resolving several new plans , none of which seems to get very far . We 'd like to see the managers quit blubbering about the agencies and make a united effort to compete , in a business way , with the speculators . In order to do this , they would have to performsome of the duties and functions of a speculator  --  which would benefit the public and themselves both . The theatregoer ( or rather the theatremaybegoer ) turns to an agency because it is centrally located and because the chances of getting- a seat are better than at the box office of the show . If theatre managers were n't such a ragtag-andbobtailed crew they would run their own ticket bureau with a plus-seventyfive-cent system and peddle their wares at first-hand , instead of letting somebody else do it . Also , they would pay some attention to our suggestions for box-office methods , Theatre box @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in town where the customer is treated like a thief , a miscreant , and a yellow dog , and where the purchase of a commodity is made to be a complete pain in the neck to the purchaser , OF therigors , hardships , and dangers which explorers face we have only a rather sketchy knowledge , wrapped up as we arc in our greatcoat and our soft living . At this distance it is hard to visualize what Rear Admiral Byrd has gone through , even though you read the Tim : - . One hazard at the time , however , came through to us with a sort of clean cold clarity  --  it was a brief radio message from Byrd , dispatched while he was flying over Antarctica in his plane . " We have discovered , " it said , " a great new mountain range in Marie Byrd Land , running in a generally north and south direction . We hope this is worth while for science , for we are flying in rough weather and taking chances to map it . " That hazard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain range , after years of preparation , and not knowing whether it is worth while for science or not Hamlet , in a tri-motored plane , uncertain whether to map or not to map , his mind ravaged by the fierce tug of indecision . We know that phase of exploration : the cold terror of arriving at a destination and doubting , even for an instant , its significance . We 've flown that far , at least , with Byrd ! THE Nation has put THE NEW YuRKER on its Honor Roll fur 1929 , along with Rear Admiral Byrd , the New York Telegram , Professor Michelson , Eva Le Gallienne , and the United States Senate . Here are the very words of the announcement : " The New Yorker , for being consistently amusing , good-tempered , intelligent , resourceful , and good-tolook-at . " We arc naturally grateful ; it is the first time anybody has put us on an honor list . But after thus elevating us , the Nation , in an explanatory paragraph , plunges us into despair . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deciding whether to give first place , on the score of humor , to the New Yorker or to the Department of State . We finally gave it to the New Yorker on the ground that our cheerful contemporary is always good-natured , which the State Department sometimes is not . But we confess that we find the State Department a great deal funnier than the New Yorker . " To us this comparison seems unfair . No magazine , whether weekly or annual , could ever hope to be as funny as the State Department . We defy most magazines to be as funny , even , as the Passport Bureau . In a comedic moment of history such as today , with its funny taxes , its funny prohibition , its funny prosperity , and its funny talk of peace , a mere publication whose aim is to interpret the times is somewhat at a loss to compete , in entertaining qualities , with the institutions themselves . We often feel like giving up and going home . Elusive AYOUNG and thoroughly up-to-date mother placed her three-year-old daughter in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It is thoroughly up on psychological adjustments , spiritual analysis , alter ego  --  and all the very newest things . The child , however , was reported not doing well . She sulked , did n't learn , and sometimes swore . The mother came over anxiously to have a talk with a director , who told her all the discouraging details . " Do n't he a bit alarmed , though , " he counselled cheerfully at the end . " We expect cuty day now to catch her rhythm . " Briton EVELM LAYE , of " Bitter Sweet , " has taken an apartment at 50 West Fifty-ninth Street to that she can walk in the Park , that being her favorite diversion . She wears a leather trench coat trimmed with fur  --  you may have seen her . She has been homesick for England ever since arriving here , although her mother landed in time to make plum pudding for Christmas . She keeps pretty much to her apartment , feeling that leading ladies should not destroy the illusion of the theatre by being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here and rarely uses taxis . She walks to the theatre , getting there usually half an hour ahead of anybody else and frequently bringing a box of cigars for the stare hands . A few of Miss Laye 's intimate friends call her " Boo . " One of them is Dennis King . He and she were once stranded together in the sticks of England when a stock company fell to pieces . Soberly talking over the future then , they made a wager as to which would be starred first . King won . Evelyn probably inherits her talent from her father , who was an actor . He toured England in minor troupes and once came to New York to play in " Peter Pan " with Maude Adams . The family still has a collection of Buster Brown comic strips which he sent home as a souvenir of his trip to this country . As a child she travelled with her father , learned much about the stage , and liked it . This was to his dismay . He did n't want her to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' school , hoping to divert her ambition . She ran away shortly , however , and joined the chorus of " Mr. Wu . " In a few years she was a prima donna . She has her own notions about things , pretty much . Ziegfeld wanted to hill her as a star when " Bitter Sweet " opened here , but she refused . She would n't even allow herself to be featured . Advertising matter had to be changed overnight to meet this unexpected situation . She does n't like press agents or interviewers and flatly refuses to talk to either at the theatre . All this bewildered Mr. Ziegfeld , but after the critics praised her , he finally gained her consent to being presented as a star . She likes Edna Ferber 's novels , Scotch toffee , and frosted chocolates . About three years ago she married Sonnie Hale , one of the popular English comedians . Subsequently they separated and a divorce is now pending . The talkies are also pending when she returns to America after a trip home next summer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ re-ported on the whims and foibles of the street-car conductors and motormen . One of the latter , at a busy hour last Saturday , stopped his northbound Fourth Avenue car at the corner of Twenty-sixth Street , and ran cater-cornered across the intersection to where a southbound car had stopped . Into this he disappeared . Most of his thirty passengers , thus abandoned , craned their necks to stare after him . He presently hurried back , hearing , for all to see , a small , red , paper pinwheel . " Gee , ' at 's a lucky break , " he explained to loungers on the front platform . " A woman and kid got off that car yesterday when I was makin ' a trip on it , and left this . I stuck it away where I could get it for my own kid , but I forgot to take it when I made my last trip .

The conductor got one of the broadest smiles of the year out of that . ? A STUDENT attending the Grad-A uate School of Fordham University met a friend . " Come on up to the campus , " he said . They went to the Woolworth Building and up to the forty-second floor . That 's where the Graduate School of Fordham University is . Use it as a topic at dinners ? " Madam , where do you suppose the campus of the Graduate School , etc. , etc ? " Tea on the East Side GGO up the steps to almost any one of the houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street , near Second Avenue , and you will find yourself in a tea house . There are dozens of them , all crowded , all filled with the clatter of strange tongues , alive with fierce gesticulations . They form , in a sense , the clubrooms of the East Side . Newly arrived immigrants are brought in , to get jobs , to look for unfound relatives . Some of them have even become art centres ; young Jewish painters hang gloomy landscapes and Lraunt portraits on the walls and sit down to wrangle over Kisling. and Matisse . Hermann 's ( last name unknown ) is as picturesque as any . His place is in a long narrow room one flight above an Italian grocery . At the front is a double window , but the dirt of years curtains it ; except for a few electric lights , the interior is always dark and heavy with smoke . The walls are of sheet tin , stamped to imitate tile . From the exact centre of the ceiling hangs an old-fashioned wooden-bladed electric fan which no one can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ group themselves about the tables by nationality  --  Armenians , Hindus , Arabs , Egyptians , Jews , each separate . The Russians sit near the rear of the room . They talk excitedly and sip pale tea , sucking it through a lump of sugar held lightly between the teeth . Between times , they drink vodka . All drinks are served in the tumblers  --  tea , schnapps , vodka , whiskey , wine  --  all brimful . The schnapps and vodka , at twenty cents a glass , arc surprisingly good . The whiskey is terrible . It is also the most expensive . Nobody but outsiders ever orders it , and Hermann charges whatever he thinks they will pay . Hermann himself is something of a man of the world . He is lean , tall , dark , muscular . He once travelled , as a sailor before the mast . He speaks eleven languages , most of them the tongues of the Near East ; he is proud of the fact that he is a thirty-second-degree Mason . Although he has had his tea house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; even his wife , short , placid , enormously fat , is addressed as Mrs. Hermann . In spite of the crowds that come to his place , Hermann is not rich . For one thing , the turnover is su slow . People who come there often sit all clay over one drink ; many of them bring in their own rye bread and salami , and make a meal out of one glass of tea . Hermann never bothers them . Furthermore , he lets the accounts of old customers run as long as they want . He keeps a little book , and they can pay by the month or by the year ; he does n't care . East Siders , he says , are honest . In all his years in business , only one customer has ever failed to pay , he reports , and in this instance there were exten Lusting circumstances . A Cuban sailor left the place one night , owing a small amount , and was killed a few minutes later in a street fight . Park Avenue THE other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the apartment houses on Park Avenue in the Fifties . For some reason the doorman was absent and she stood at the curb , tapping one toe impatiently . Only for a few moments though . Rcsourccf silly , she placed two fingers between her lips , schoolboy fashion , and blew a loud clear blast . Not one , but three cabs responded , and several passers-by gasped . Valuable Scraps SIMMER it down , and you 'll probably find there is no end to the collecting business . We have come upon Mr. Burnet Hershey . His specialty is documents pertaining to the Versailles Peace Conference and his accumulation is unique and valuable . A journalist at the Conference , he began by saving the mimeographed communiqw 's released from official sources . Copies of these were so plentiful they immediately became scrap paper , but Hershey saved one of each and now has the only complete set in existence . At the same time he broadened his scope , going after maps , memoranda , copies of treaties distributed to the plenipotentiaries , and the like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ delegations , in effect organizing a secret service of his own . He thus got his must valuable item , a copy of the first draft of the covenant of the League of Nations . Six copies only were made of this and all of these , save his and one retained by Mrs. Woodrow Wilson , are lost now . Hershey also came into possession of the second draft of the covenant . These two documents , together with the treaty as finally drawn up , show the steps taken in form ulating the League of Nations agreement , the most interesting document in recent history . Many of the Conference documents came from German delegates or attacHs . The Germans were n't supposed to know about the existence of many of them which were " secret and confidential . " The y had their own way of getting hold of things , however , although their headquarters at Versailles was guarded and they were n't even allowed to go into Paris . They had the best secret service of any country in the war , probably , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got well acquainted with the Germans . Allied correspondents at the Conference were denied entrance to the German delegation 's headquarters , but he copied the dress of the Germans ? wore a frock coat , a German make of hat , and put on horn-rimmed spectacles , carried a portfolio , and thus passed in and out , the French guards never questioning him . He was , of course , discovered as an American by the Germans but they thought it was a pretty good joke . He won their friendship , largely by making them presents of brilliantine , which he bought in Paris . They gave him many papers . It has become known that the Hershey collection exists and he has had many offers for it  --  from libraries , statesmen , museums , and even the Japanese Foreign Office . Pharmacopoeia APROFESSOR of archeology , re-turning from Central America , arrived with some earthen bowls , dried herbs , charms , and so on , and these bewildered the customs man . He just did n't know what to do about it , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ huddle they turned to the archeologist with a question directed at the heart of the matter : " What are these things used for ? " They were used , the archeologist explained , by medicine men of prehistoric Yucatan . " Ah , " said one of the inspectors , " we 'll list them under ' Druggists ' Samples ' and let them go through . " Big and Little IN a men 's store , buying a handsome suit for ourself , we were ushered into one of those little privy chambers for the changing of the pants . Immediately , we spied a large shoehorn  --  by far the largest shoehorn. in existence . It was so large that it was two feet long . Beside it was a little buttonhook , so little that it was no bigger than a buttonhook should be . Well , you Can imagine that this state of affairs among the shoehorns and buttonhooks of our shop piqued our interest ; so we hung around a long time , after we 'd changed our pants , plucking at fabrics and criticizing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the big shoehorn . Finally we blurted it right nut : " Why is the shoehorn so big ? " we asked . " Men ca n't resist taking shoehorns away with them , " answered the clerk . " Men slip them into their pockets , if they 're just regular little shoehorns . They 've got to be enormous , or men can spirit them away when we 're not lhoking . " For a short time that satisfied us . Then we got thinking . " Why are the buttonhooks so small , then ? " we asked . The clerk looked at us angrily . " They do n't swipe buttonhooks , " he said . " They just swipe shoehorns . Nobody swipes buttonhooks . " Dark Red Tape ONE of our Washington agents re- ? s --  , ports exactly what happened in government circles over the big problem of communicating that note to the Soviets . The United States not having recognized the Union of Socialist Soviet Republics  --  the State Department , in fact , being grimly oblivious of its existence  --  it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and send a cable addressed " Moscow , U.S.S.R. " That would he recognizing the Soviet government . At the same time he knew that if he addressed it " Moscow , Russia , " it would n't get anywhere  --  the Soviets Would indignantly refuse to accept a cable so addressed . This difficult situation , the toughest Secretary Stimson has had to face since the Gann-Lnngworth dilemma , got him down for a time . Finally , after thought and solemn consultation , he sent the cable to France , requesting that government to forward it . The French performed this service courteously , keeping a straight face , simply changing " Russia " to " U. S. S. R. " and sending the message along , Now if Mr. Stimson had decided to send the note by mail , instead of cable , he would have been in hot water of an even higher temperature . A letter addressed " Moscow , Russia , " would instantly have been returned by our own Post Office Department , with a rubber-stamped notice that the address was insufficient The Post @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it is addressed " U.S.S.R. " In short , the Post Office recognizes the Soviet government , but not the old Russian government , while the State Department recognizes the old Russian government but not the Soviets . In this way the United States avoids entanglements with foreign nations . ? NO doubt about it , the talkies do complicate life . A talkie-goer has made this complaint : The other day she arrived in a theatre just before the conclusion of the feature picture . In the old days , to remain in pleasant ignorance of the outcome , she would have had merely to lean back and shut her eyes . Now , in addition to doing this , she has to put her fingers in her ears . Orthography THE dial telephone- still has its surprises . Sometimes it is the telephone company which is surprised . One subscriber had had his new instrument for scarcely two weeks when he entered tearful complaint about the number of calls he received which were for other people . Someune was always ringing and asking if this was the delicatessen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insisted that everybody who got a wrong number got him . The company installed en observer , puzzled , frowned , tested wires and instruments , and got nowhere . For days it was a mystery , and it probably would have continued one to this day but for a young engineer who suddenly hit upon the explanation while shaving one morning . The subscriber was on the Watkins exchange . The bright fellow suddenly realized that if you spelled out Watkins instead of dialling just w.s.a. and then going into the number , the switchboard automatically transposed " kin ? ' into 5467 . The machines put through a call as soon as seven characters have been registered . Consequently , no matter what numbers they dialled afterward , people who spelled out Watkins got WAT 5467 . And the unfortunate subscribc-r 's number , my dear Watson , was Watkins 5467 . It was just hard luck all around . The gentleman had n't been getting all the wrong numbers called in the city hurt he had been getting all the calls from tyros at the dial who spelled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which does n't spell anything . Watkins 5467 has been abandoned . Old New York DEFERENCE was made here late- ly to the razing of a building which exposed a forgotten placard annwacing Francis Wilson in " When Knights Were Bold . " Now , if you hurry right up to Third Avenue . and Seventy-eighth Street you may sec exposed a long-hidden wall upon which is printed , in several colors : " Old Rye and Bourbon Whiskies , Cognac &; Rochelle Brandies , Rum , Apple Jack , Blackberry &; Cherry Brandies , Madeira , Port , Sher ? " oh , that gives the idea .
