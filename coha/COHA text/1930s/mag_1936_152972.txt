After the quail-shooting season closes and before spring plowing begins , people in the South who really know and care about bird dogs turn their attention to the field trials , the series of winter tournaments culminating with the National Championship at Grand Junction , Tenn . There , last week , over the broad acres of Hobart Ames 's plantation , the biggest galleries in years plodded after a field of 23 pointers and two setters , run in pairs for heats of three hours each . Weeks of cold and snow had made birds so scarce that , despite ideal weather , for the first time in all the 40 years of the championship , one heat was run without either dog making a find . <P> With broad-shouldered Planter Ames , a patriarchal figure in mustard corduroy , at the head of the procession , the championship week began with a fast heat by Yankee Doodle Jack , and a hot favorite , the orange-spotted pointer , Doctor Blue Willing . The latter stayed in hand better than on two other championship occasions and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handled his birds like a Ziegfeld beauty handles a millionaire . " Tips Manitoba Jake , the big , white- &-black; pointer owned by Golfer Glenna Collett Vare ( see p. 27 ) , ran the next heat worthy of notice . He , too , had the morning course where birds were more plentiful , scoring six finds to four by his brace mate , Air Circus . There was pathos in the next heat . Out came Oil Tycoon Jacob France 's big pointer , Kremlin , winner of many a lesser stake , to try once more for the blue ribbon of bird dogdom . But his seven years hung heavy upon him . When famed Handler Chesley Harris released him at the starting signal , Kremlin just stood there . Then he tried to start , but he had only three legs . A tendon had tied up . He hobbled out 75 yd. from the gallery , turned and looked back apologetically . Handler Harris had to take him up . <P> Third day 's honors went to Pointer Ufton Congressman , obedient and stylish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rain-drenched ground . His brace mate disgraced herself by chasing off after a covey of deer . Next good heat of the stake was run by Sulu , liver- &-white; pointer bitch owned by Andrew G. C. Sage , whose Rapid Transit , champion in 1933 , had run disappointingly the first day . Last year , Sulu had the honor of working in the runoffs as brace mate to Homewood Flirtatious the day Homewood Flirtatious won the Trials . Last week Sulu found six coveys and worked with dainty accuracy on single birds . That afternoon Homewood Flirtatious made a sorry showing . She ran slowly through a warm afternoon , pointing four out of eight times where birds we 're not . Equipoise , the second setter of the meeting , did no better . <P> The Saturday afternoon crowd was pulling for a Memphis dog called Hugh White , but he found only one covey and one rabbit . That left only one dog to run , Wicomico . Waiting around the drug store and hotel in tiny Grand Junction , experts figured that here was a make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ win . Otherwise , two or more top dogs would be called back to try again . For once , the wise bird dog fanciers of Grand Junction were wrong . Wicomico 's heat was not good enough to win . Instead of calling for a runoff , the judges gave first prize-$1,500 and a second leg on the Robert Worth Bingham Trophy-to Mr. Sage 's Sulu.
