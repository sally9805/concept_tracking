Tokyo was tense last week with citizens in ignorance of behind-the-scenes doings in the grim Oriental tug-of-war be tween Army and Party leaders which upset the Hirota Cabinet ( TIME , Feb.1 ) . <P> Efforts to form a new Cabinet by more or less mild General Kazushige Ugaki , retired , were abandoned after bodyguards of the Premier-Designate had been obliged to fight off last week an especially resolute group of would-be assassins , assumed by the panicky populace to be " regular Army assassins . " Only hasty decision at midnight by the Emperor 's advisers to have the Son-of-Heaven ask a onetime War Minister and stanch Army man , General Senjuro Hayashi , to take over the job of Cabinetmaking somewhat slackened tension , by no means ended the crisis . <P> In Washington at latest reports Japanese Ambassador Hirosi Saito was uncertain whether or not he was being called home to become Foreign Minister , as correspondents were cabling from Tokyo .

" There is talk in the streets , " softly ad mitted the Count , " but the Army has no intention of carrying out a Dictatorship or a Fascist regime . "
