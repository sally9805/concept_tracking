Co-operation Uncoordinated <P> While Big Business , at the conference of the National Association of Manufacturers was proclaiming its new-found passion to cooperate with the New Deal in Manhattan last week ( see p. 49 ) the Council for Industrial Progress , called by President Roosevelt 's Coordinator for Industrial cooperation , met in Washington with not a single top-notch business leader in attendance . Prime reason for Big Business ' boycott of this first post-Election attempt to devise a substitute for NRA was that the Coordinator for Industrial Co-operation is big , smooth , hairy-fisted Major George Leonard Berry , who is also longtime president of International Pressmen and Assistants Union . <P> Coordinator Berry 's invitations to his first co-operation party , year ago , were also turned down by the nation 's industrial leaders , who then made no bones of their antipathy to New Deal meddling ( TIME , Dec. 16 , 1935 ) . Since Nov. 3 Big Businessmen have professed themselves more than eager to cooperate , but not under the supervision of a Labor leader . The biggest businessman Coordinator Berry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paine , Manhattan , who heads the Music Publishers ' Protective Association . Perfectly willing to let NRA-substitute ideas simmer in more than one pot , President Roosevelt sent the Berry conference a noncommittal greeting , written before his South American trip , expressing the hope that their deliberations would " promote the stability of our whole national economy . " <P> Even Labor , split by the feud between the American Federation of Labor and the Committee for Industrial Organization , was not unanimously represented at the conference . With A. F. of L. 's President William Green leading the Council 's Labor section , C. I. O. Chairman John L. Lewis announced himself out-of-town , resting . But some 900 representatives of Labor and small business turned up , sat down for a two-day talkfest about Government regulation of Business . <P> " There was definite agreement , " declared Chairman Paine when the conference was over , ' ' on the need for systematic reduction of hours and increases of pay . " But the formal conclusions of the conferees were so nebulous that seasoned Washington correspondents despaired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Council 's recommendations were left to be ironed out by a committee to be appointed by Coordinator Berry , which would also decide whether they should be submitted to Congress in legislative drafts or merely presented to President Roosevelt for his consideration . <P> Evening after his conference adjourned , Major Berry took to the radio , offered to resign as Coordinator for Industrial Co-operation if large industry would thereby be persuaded to cooperate . " Of course , " boomed he , " I fully understand that there are those who previously declined to join us because they disliked the President and also because they disliked the representation of organized Labor . . . . Now they do n't dislike the President . . . . They want to cooperate . But in order to cooperate with the Federal Government the President must get himself a new co-ordinator . "
