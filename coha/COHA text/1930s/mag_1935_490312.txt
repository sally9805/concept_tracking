DYING-ELEGANCE NOTE : At no time do we feel so like a late Roman as when we are on our way to a smart haberdashery , bearing a card admitting us to an exclusive pre-liquidation sale . IF we had time we 'd like to write " The Twenty-Eight Days of Musa February . " It 's been quite a month . Neily Vanderbilt said farewell to Fifth Avenue for the twentieth time , Duris Duke got married to an advertising man , the municipal ground hog came and went , and the Hauptmann trial wound up on the same day that the Tribune published the headline " LINCOLN UP ALL NIGHT DECIDING TO FREE SLAVES . " Feeling its oats , the Daily Worker announced " an autographed de luxe edition of ' Hunger and Revolt , ' the pictorial history of the world crisis . " Quite a month . The Macon sank , Admiral Byrd started for home , and a new Sunday supplement appeared , a riot of cnlorgravure . The other papers covered Septuagesima and the threat of war in Africa . Rudy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ removal ; and the Reno Merry-Go-Round , 146 East Fifty-sixth Street , arranged weekly " freedom parties " for divorcees . A witness in a civil action in Seattle stopped the trial when he answered " Oakie-doke " to a question . The New Deal administration , learning that Mickey Mouse single-handed had lifted the receivership for the Lionel Toy Train Company and sold five million dollars ' worth of Ingersoll watches , opened negotiations with Disney for a Mickey Mouse dollar . Washington , Lincoln , and Babe Ruth celebrated their birthdays , and the only thing lacking was a ten-word message from Postal to Western Union on the fourteenth : " ROSES RED VIOLETS BLUE SUGAR SWEET PHOOEY FOR YOU COLLECT . " MR . VANDERBILT , as we remarked , has said farewell to Fifth Avenue , but it is up to us to say goodbye to the Park Avenue tunnel , where the streetcars used to run , between Forty-first and Thirty-third . The new buses do n't dare go in the tunnel , they stick to the roadway ; and this leaves the city with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very guts of Murray Hill . What 's tn become of it ?

The Boston &; Maine could garage their new streamlined train there  --  which would be a wonderful convenience to us . It would make a good root cellar , and a fine place to start bulbs . America 's Little House could keep its lawnmower , crab-apple jelly , and children 's sleds down there , as well as the cook 's trunk . A nice thing to do with it would be to install steam heat and fit it up as an all-night gameroom for bums , free checkers and beer . Unquestionably it will he turned into an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should he owning a car anyway  --  like us . NEXT year , when Dog Show time comes round , we would like tosee a wholly new brand of showmanship introduced into the Garden . We were horribly bored by the judging last week  --  all that business of standing around a ring , hour after hour , brushing a dog 's hair the wrong way and jacking his tail up with the palm of your hand . Who cares , anyway ? Only a handful of fanciers know about a dog 's points , and besides , conformation and ring manners are piffling qualities in a dog , revealing little about the animal 's character , exploits , or temper . A dog should be made to work for his ribbon , each breed in its own wise . Pointers should have to point . Shepherds should be required to herd a band of sheep from the east goal to the west goal . Poodles should he required to jump through a paper hoop , not just follow Mrs. Sherman Hoyt around the ring . English bull terriers should he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ducks , Scotties chew up old shoes . Greyhounds should be put over the high hurdles . Sled dogs should race with a little antitoxin , while St. Bernards carry brandy to anyone in the audience who feels weak , preferably us . Beagles would jolly well have to beagle , or shut up . How about it , dogs  --  are you dogs , or mice ? THE surest indication of the re- turn of good times is the return of surliness in the town 's box offices . During the slump , ticket men were too weary to be objectionable , too far reduced in circumstances to maintain the tradition of incivility . There is a different spirit abroad this winter : a patron can go to the play these fine gusty days confident of being treated once more as an impostor by the person who takes his money at the window . Day 's Pay THE afternoon following the great blizzard of 1935 , an energetic young resident of a municipality to the north got home early from his office and set out to clear his driveway . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was busy , and as our friend gradually approached the end of his task , he came nearer and nearer to them . Finally , as he stood resting on his shovel practically among them , he was astonished to be addressed by a gentleman who seemed to he the boss . " That will he all for today , " the gentleman said , officially , and handed our man two dollars . Dentures SEVERAL years ago , when all the George Washington research workers began to assemble their data for the Bicentenary of 1932 , Dr. Bernhard Wolf ' Weinberger , formerly Professor of Dental History and Literature at N.Y.U. , started to dig up all he could about Washington 's dental history and his false teeth , or dentures . He had little to start with . He knew that Washington had had lots of dental trouble , that one set of teeth was buried with him , and that another set was at the Baltimore College of Dental Surgery . Both sets were presumably by John Greenwood . That was about nil . No one had ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than Greenwood . The first thing Dr. Weinberger discovered , in a search which led through the New York Public Library to the London Public Record Office , was that a French dentist named Le Mayeur came here , obtained a letter of recommendation to Washington , and did some work for him . Dr. Weinberger 's method was to check all known Washington diaries , ledgers , and other private papers , and follow up clues wherever they led him . He was handicapped by the fact that Washington was sensitive about his teeth until quite late in life , and even to his diary would say only " I was indisposed today " when he had had a toothache , or " Stayed at home today " when he 'd really remained there to receive a dentist . Dr. Weinberger discovered the great-great-grandson of John Greenwood living here in New Yorke real-estate man named Joseph Rudd Greenwood , who died last year . This Mr. Greenwood had in his possession the first set of teeth Washington ever wore , made in 1789 , with a hole in the plate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had that , too , glass-enclosed and set in a gold locket . Mr. Greenwood revealed that there had been another plate , for the lower jaw , in his family , but that , counter to the will of the original Greenwood , which specified that the teeth should not be given away until there should be no male heir , one Isaac John Greenwood , in the eighteen-twenties , had given this plate away in two pieces , it having been broken . Dr. ? Veinberger traced one piece to the London Hospital Medical College , but all he could learn of the other was that it had gone to South America about 1825 . The late Joseph Rudd Greenwood left no male heir , and the teeth will go to a museum ; which one has n't been decided yet . Dr. Weinberger found a third new set in the possession of Mrs. Charlotte R. Mustard of Baltimore , after tracing it down through an involved line which included Martha Washington and Eli-za Custis . It 's a full set , upper and lower , the bases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pound , and it 's unlikely that Washington could have done much chewing with it . The Doctor thinks it was used when he was sitting for some of his portraits . There 's supposed to be still another set , made by one James Gardette , which Wash-ington wore for a 1796 Stuart portrait , but the only track the Doctor could get of these plates was a vague record , made in 1859 , that they were in the possession of " a man in Savannah ? ' There are some indica-tions , too , that Paul Re-vere , who seems to have made teeth , along with everything else , once made Washington a set ; a thorough search of all Revere 's carefully kept records failed to confirm this . Dr. Weinberger Iong ago realized that it would be impossible to complete his re-search for the Bicentenary- , but he kept right on and now he 's just finished a five-hundred-page manuscript on his work . Solution SOME graduate students in chemis-kJ try down at Princeton were assigned a problem by their instructor the other day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the following morning . It turned out to be so complicated none of the young men could do a thing with it . One was more resourceful than the rest , however . After struggling for several hours , he gave up , and called Information , asking for Professor Einstein 's telephone number . It took a little persuading to get it , but he won out , and the Professor himself answered . He was very nice . In no time at all , right over the wire , he worked the problem out . Said it was no trouble ; glad to he of service . Hence the Camel IN the current Harper 's Bazaar is a full-page photograph of a charming young lady wearing a two-toned tweed suit and standing beside a camel , " Good for travel , " explains the caption , " ( hence the camel ) . " Weil , we know a story about this picture . When the Harper 's Bazaar people get the idea of posing a model with a camel , they began shopping around New York for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no problem at an . Another time we 'll tell you where to get camels whenever you want them . ) Best place for the photograph , it turned out , was the Botanical Garden , so they called up and asked if they might invade one of the greenhouses long enough to take some pictures of a girl with a camel . Why , of course , they were told ; come right ahead . Charmed by the ease with which things were working out , they took their young lady and their camel up into the Bronx and , after a certain amount of trouble ( mostly with the camel ) , got them inside a greenhouse filled with rare tropical shrubs and began taking pictures . At this point a Botanical Garden official came running in , in a really dangerous emotional state . He bawled incoherently , but they gathered that he wanted to know what they were doing in his greenhouse with a camel . Did n't he remember , asked one of the photographers , that they 'd called up and got permission to take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You did n't say " the official groaned , " you said ' camera . ' " Both parties to the misunderstanding looked at each other gloomily for a long time ; then the H filer 's Bazaar men began shoving the camel out of the greenhouse . He ate most of a pretty valuable shrub on his way out , which did n't help matters any . They set up their cameras out-side and took the pictures . That 's all there is to the story , and we hope you appreciate what magazines go through for you . Home Product CHANCCHANCES are that on next Tues- ES when Albert Spalding gives his only New York solo recital of the season , one of the most enthusiastic auditors will he Mayor LaGuardia , who , everyone may not know , is an old comrade-in-arms . Afterward the two might even get together and talk over their World War days , when they engaged in international intrigue of E. Phillips Oppenheim-like proportions .

Could n't do it legally , of course , because of Spain 's neutrality . So they sneaked into Spain , in civilian clothes , bought their supplies , and began looking around for a way to get them out . They were stuck until Fiorello had a notion . Find the Spanish shipping company which has suffered the biggest loss from German submarines , he said , and they 'll he pro-Ally . And sure enough , he and his admiring companion were able to seduce a company into secretly delivering all the supplies they wanted . " An interesting and exciting little trip , " Spalding calls it . Except for the war interlude , Spalding 's life has been placid . His biggest problem , he has said , was getting established as an artist in the face of his father 's wealth . He began young  --  won the violin prize at the Bologna Conservatory when lie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fourteen-year-old had won it ; first winner was a promising lad named Mozart . Spalding made his ckbut in Paris when he was sixteen , but he wore long trousers and was n't billed as a prodigy . A few weeks after that he played at Patti 's final appearance in Paris . Through some nightmarish mixup , his own accompanist failed to arrive , and lie had to play with Patti 's accompanist . He Caine through with colors flying , and Patti told him , " Do n't worry , you 'll have a career . " He made his American debut when he was twenty , with the New York Symphony . Then came a series of concerts backed by his father , which did n't prove much either way , and , in 1910 , a tour of Russia , which was a big success . Artistically speaking , that is . Financially not so good , because the manager swiped most of the receipts . From there Spalding went right on , being more and more successful . When he joined the army , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His fees now run to one hundred thousand dollars annually , they say . Spalding remembers his 1917 voyage overseas ( as they used to call it ) chiefly because the food was bad and he lived on handouts from a friendly cabin boy named Dick . Last year he announced while broadcasting that if Dick would look him up , he'd*buy him the best meal he ever ate . About five hundred Dicks wrote in suggesting Spalding send the money for the meal , which he did n't . Offer 's still open , if you 're Dick . Spalding lives comfortably , he and his wife dividing their time between here and Great Barrington . They have a palazzo in Florence , but have n't been there in three years . Once in a while he shows up at a directors ' meeting of A. G. Spalding &; Bros. , the family firm . His only deep athletic interest is tennis .

Anonymous p EADERS of the maritime news will no doubt remember that a pretty important launching took place at Camden last month  --  a huge tank steamer built for the Socony-Vacuum Company . We have just learned about a frantic scene that took place , in the office of the company which built the ship , immediately before the launching . The president and all the high officials were receiving reporters and cameramen , and answering all sorts of questions about the new vessel  --  her length , breadth , deck space , size of engines , and so on . After about an hour of this , oneof the reporters glanced over his notes and said apologetically that he did n't seem to have got the name of the tanker . The president thought for a moment , then said that he was darned if he could think of it him-self . He turned to the next in command ? vice-president , or general manager , or some-body of equal impor-tance  --  but he could n't think of it , either . Well , to make a pain-fully long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the name of the ship they 'd built . One of the company officials finally whis-pered in the ear of an office boy , who imme-diately left the office . After a period of stall-ing around , during which nobody knew which way to look , the office boy came run-ning hack with the name . He had found it out by climbing over the ship 's cradle and peering up at the stern . Socony-Vacuum , it was called . The reporters jotted this down , and everybody went out to the launching , with the name well in mind . Miscount THE vaudeville act of Mr. and Mrs. Dionne in Chicago opened with a motion picture of a day in the life of the quintuplets . A lady writes us to report that the woman beside her in the theatre watched the pictures with obvious disappointment , and finally voiced her disillusionment .

" Pipes Whistler AJOKE  --  you 've heard it a dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Forgotten Man being Whistler 's father . The joke has point , for Whistler 's mother is a byword in the land , but who ever heard of her husband ? A gentleman on Governors Island , Mr. Carlisle Allan , detided to look into the matter , and his findings are interesting and ironic . George Washington Whistler , it turns nut , was one of the greatest engineers in the world in his day . When they buried him , in a small cemetery in Stottington , Connecticut , in 1849 , even the Czar of Russia bowed his head . The elder Whistler ( father , by the way , of one famous son , six forgotten sons , and a forgotten daughter ) washorn in 1800 in the Northwest Territory . His own father , John , although only a lieutenant , won the favorable notice of President Madison because of having built Fort Dearborn . George Washington Whistler ( the Forgotten Man ) lived in that fort until he was eleven . Later , President Madison , still mindful of John Whistler 's services , appointed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was nineteen , Number 10 man in a class of thirty , ranking first in drawing . ( Some thirty years later , James McNeil Whistler ranked first in his class in drawing at West Point , too . ) Shortly after graduation , George Washington Whistler was assigned to a corps making surveys for the harbor defences of the New England coast . He devised the contour system now uni versally used in topography . Later  --  after a year at West Point as a professor of drawing  --  he helped trace a part of the Canadian border . That took four years . Then he went in for railroad-building and shortly became the most distinguished American engineer of his day . With one Captain McNeil he built four or five railroads , and laid some track for the Baltimore &; Ohio . After that , Whistler resigned from the army to become chief engineer of a company called " Proprietors of the Locks and Canals on the Merrimack River . " This took him to Lowell , Massachusetts . There Whistler and his assistants took apart and put together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their study of it began building the finest locomotives in America . In Lowell , James Abbott Whistler ( he changed his middle name to McNeil  --  his mother 's maiden name  --  at West Point ) was horn . In Lowell , too , the Forgotten Whistler invented the locomotive whistle , just a little thing he thought up on the side . In 1842 , the Forgotten Man was selected from among the best engineers of Europe and America by Czar Nicholas I of Russia to build the St. Petersburg-Moscow railroad . Whistler spent seven years at it and was paid twelve thousand dollars a year . He had as many as two hundred locomotives and six thousand cars under construction at one time , and was in charge of sixty thousand mechanics and laborers . He did n't quite finish the railroad because he died in Russia in 1849 of cholera . The Czar had given him the Cross of St. Anne while he lived , and sent his body to the Baltic seaboard on the imperial barge when he died , accompanied by the then unknown lady @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a United States stamp . There is a monument to him in Greenwood Cemetery in Brooklyn , erected by the American Society of Engineers . In what little spare time he had , George Washington Whistler played the flute for relaxation . At West Point , hecause of that , he gained the nickname of Pipes .

It may even constitute a short introduction to Oriental philosophy . The butler we are now speaking of had been taught by his employer ? at the price of considerable mental strain on both sides  --  to keep the household accounts in a special ledger ; when he finally got the idea , though , he became an enthusiastic and meticulous bookkeeper .
