; the printing outfit , securely roped and lashed , went in the other . This wagon held the little hand press ; two six-column forms ; the case rack containing the type ( cardboard was tacked snugly over this to keep the type from escaping ) ; the rollers ; a stock of paper ; a can of printer 's ink , tubes of job ink , a box of wooden quoins used in locking the forms . There was , to the Wichita eye , nothing unusual in the sight of these huge covered freighters that would soon go lumbering off toward the horizon . Their like had worn many a track in the Kansas prairie . The wagon train had wound its perilous way westward since the day of the old Spanish trail , deeply rutted by the heavy wheels of Mexican carts . The very Indians who traffickedin pelts and furs and human beings had used the white man 's trails for their trading . Yet in this small expedition faring forth there was something that held , the poignancy of the tragic and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impractical ; the woman , tight lipped , terribly determined , her eyes staring with the fixed , unseeing gaze of one who knows that to blink but once is to be awash with tears ; the child , out of hand with excitement and impatience to be gone . From the day of Yancey 's recital of the Run , black nowhere to be found . The wagons , packed , stood waiting before the Venable house . Perhaps never in the history of the settling of the West did a woman go a-pioneering in such a costume . Sabra had driven horses all her life ; so now she stepped agilely from ground to hub , from hub to wheel top , perched herself on the high wagon seat and gathered up5zthe reins with deftness and outward composure . Her eyes were enormous , her pale face paler . She wore last year 's second best gray cheviot , lined , boned , basqued , and ( though plain for its day ) braided all the way down the front with an elaborate pattern of curlycues . Her gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bird . Her feet , in high buttoned shoes , were found to touch the wagon floor with difficulty , so at the last minute a footstool was snatched from the house and placed so that she might brace herself properly during the long and racking drive . This article of furniture was no more at variance with its surroundings than the driver herself . A plump round mahogany foot rest it was , covered with a gay tapestry that had been stitched by Sabra 's grandmother on the distaff side . Its pattern of faded scarlet and yellow and blue representedwhat seemed to be a pair of cockatoos sparring in a rose bush . Yancey had swung Cim up to the calicocushionedseat beside Sabra . His short legs , in their copper-toed boots , stuck straight out in front of him . His dark eyes were huge with excitement . " Why do n't we go ? " he demanded , over and over , in something like a scream . He shouted to the horses as he had heard teamsters do . " Giddap in ' ere ! Gee-op @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up with sudden agony in their faces at sight of this little expedition actually faring forth so absurdly into the unknown , had ceased to exist for Cim . As Sabra drove one wagon and Yancey the other , the boy pivoted between them through the long drive , spending the morning in the seat beside his mother , the afternoon beside his father , with intervals of napping curled up on the bedding at the53iiiback of the wagon . All through the first day they could do nothing with him . He yelled , " Giddap ! Whoa ! Gee-op ! " until he was hoarse , pausing only to shoot imaginary bears , panthers , wildcats and Indians , and altogether working himself up into such a state of excitement and exhaustion that he became glittering eyed and feverish and subsequently had to be inconvenientlydosed with castor oil . Now , with a lurch and a rattle and a great clatter of hoofs the two wagons were off . Sabra had scarcely time for one final frantic look at her father and mother , at minor massed Venables , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyeballs . She was so busy with the horses , with Cim , so filled with a dizzy mixture of fright and exhilaration and a kind of terror-stricken happiness that she forgot to turn and look back , as she had meant to , like the heroine in a melodrama , at the big white house , at the hedge , at the lovely untidy garden , at the three great elms . Later she reproached herself for this . And she would say to the boy , in the bare treeless ugliness of the town that became their home , " Cim , do you remember the yellow and purple flags that used to come up first thing in the spring , in the yard ? " " What yard ? " " Granny 's yard , back home . " " Nope . " " Oh , Cim ! " It was as though the boy 's life had begun with this trip . The four previous years of his existence seemed to be sponged from his mind like yesterday 's exercise from a slate . Perched beside his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in tales that became forever part of his consciousness and influenced his whole life . They had made an early start . By ten the boy 's eyes were heavy with sleep . He refused stubbornly to lie on the mattress inside the larger wagon ; denied that he was sleepy . Sabra coaxed him to curl up on the wagon seat , his head in her lap . She held the reins in one hand ; one arm was about the child . It was hot and still and drowsy . Noon came with surprising swiftness . They had brought along a precious keg of water and a food supply sufficient , they thought , to last through most of the tri  --  alt pork , mince and apple pies , bread , doughnut  --  uttheir appetites were enormous . At midday they stopped and ate in the shade . Sabra prepared the meal while Yancey tended the horses . Cim , wide awake now and refreshed , ate largely with them of the fried salt pork and potatoes , the hard-boiled eggs , the mince pie . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey had been provided by his grandparents . It was all very gay and comfortable and relaxed . Short as the morning had been , the afternoon stretched out , somehow , endless . Sabra began to be horribly tired , cramped . The boy whimpered . It was mid-afternoonand hot ; it was late afternoon ; then the brilliant Western sunset began to paint the sky . Yancey , in the wagon ahead , drew up , gazed about , got out , tied his team to one of a clump of cottonwoods . " We 'll camp here , " he called to Sabra and came toward her wagon , prepared to lift her down , and the boy . She was stiff , utterly weary . She stared down at him , dully , then around the landscape . " Camp ? " 55 l " Yes . For the night . Come , Cim . " He lifted the boy down with a great swoop . " You mean for the night ? Sleep here ? " He was quite matter-of-fact . " Yes . It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a fire before you can say Jack Robinson . Where 'd you think you were going to sleep ? Back home ? " Somehow she had not thought . She had not believed it . To sleep out of doors like this , in the open , with only a wagon top as roof ! All her neat conventional life she had slept in a four-poster bed with a dotted Swiss canopy and net curtains and linen sheets that smelled sweetly of the sun and the air . Yancey began to make camp . Already the duties of this new manner of living had become familiar . There was wood to gather , a fire to start , water to be boiled . Cim , very wide awake now , trotted after his father , after his mother . Meat began to sizzle appetizingly in the pan . The exquisite scent of coffee revived them with its promise of stimulation . " That roll of carpet , " called Sabra , busy at the fire , to Yancey at the wagon . " Under the seat . I want Cim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damp . . . . " A sudden shout from Yancey . A squeal of terror from the bundle of carpeting in his arm  --  bundle that suddenlywas alive and wriggling . Yancey dropped it with an oath . The bundle lay on the ground a moment , heaving , then it began to unroll itself while the three regarded it with , starting eyes . A black paw , a woolly head , a face all open mouth and whites of eyes . Black Isaiah . He had found a way to come with them to the Indian Territory. 56BY NOON next day they were wondering how they had got on at all without him . He gathered wood . He started fires . He tended Cim like a nurse , played with him , sang to him , helped put him to bed , slept anywhere , like a little dog . He even helped Sabra to drive her team , change and change about , for after all there was little to it but the holding of the reins slackly in one 's fingers while the horses plodded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mile . Yancey pointed out the definiteness with which the land changed when they left Kansas and came into the Oklahoma country . " Okla-homa , " he explained to Cim . " That 's Choctaw . Okl  --  eople . Humm  --  ed . Red People . That 's what they called it when the Indians came here to live . " Suddenly the land , too , had become red : red clay as far as the eye could see . The rivers and little creeks were sanguine with it , and at sunset the sky seemed to reflectit , so that sometimes Sabra 's eyes burned with all this scarlet . When the trail led through a cleft in a hillthe blood red of the clay on either side was like a gaping wound . Sabra shrank from it . She longed for the green of Kansas . The Oklahoma sky was not blue but steel color , and all through the day it was a brazen sheet of glittering tin over their heads . Its glare seared the eyeballs . It was a hard trip for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not run about , except when they stopped to make camp . Sabra , curiously enough , had not the gift of amusing him as Yancey had , or even Isaiah . Isaiah told him tales that were negro folklore , handed down by word of mouth through the years . Like the songs he sang , these were primitive accounts of the sorrows and the tribulations of a wronged people and their inevitable reward in after life . " An ' de angel say to him , he say , Mose , come on up on dis'ya throne an ' eat ' case yo ' hongry , an ' drink ' case yo ' parch , and res ' yo ' weary an ' achin ' feet ... ' " But when he rode with his father he heard thrilling tales . If it was just before his bedtime , after their early supper had been eaten , Yancey invariably began his story with the magic words , " It was on just such a nightas this ... " There would follow a legend of buried treasure . Spanish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , led , perhaps , by the false golden promises of some captured Indian eager to get back to the home of his own tribe far away . Like all newly settled countries , there were here hundreds of such tales . The sparsely settled land was full of them . The poorer the class the more glittering the treasure. 58These people , wresting a meager living from the barren plains , consoled themselves with tales of buried Spanish gold ; of jewels . No hairy squatter or nester in his log cabin with his bony parchment-skinned wife and litter of barelegged brats but had some tale of long-sought treasure . Cim heard dozens of these tales as they dragged their way across the red clay of Oklahoma , as they forded rivers , passed little patches of blackjack or cottonwood . He was full of them . They became as real to him as the rivers and trees themselves . During the day Yancey told him stories of the Indians . He taught him the names of the Five Civilized Tribes , and Cim remembered the difficult Indian words and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Chickasaw . He heard the Indian story , not in terms of raids , scalpings , tomahawk , and tom-tom , but as the saga of a tricked and wronged people . Yancey Cravat needed only a listener . That that listener was four , and quite incapable of comprehending the significanceof what he heard , made no difference to Cravat . He told the boy the terrific story of the Trail of Tears ? of the Cherokee Nation , a simple and unnomadic people , driven from their homes in Georgia , like cattle across hundreds of miles of plain and prairie to die by the thousands before they reached the Oklahoma land that had been allotted to them , with two thousand troops under General Winfield Scott to urge on their flagging footsteps . " Why did they make the Indians go away ? " " They wanted the land for themselves . " " Why ? " " It had marble , and gold and silver and iron and lead , 59 land great forests . So they took all this away from them and drove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their promise . " Sabra was horrified at Cim 's second-hand recital of this saga . He told her all about it as he later sat on the seat beside her . " Uncle Sam is a mean bad man . He took all the farms and the gold and the silver and the buff ' - loes away from the Indians and made them go away and they did n't want to go and so they went and they died . " He knew more about David Payne than about Columbus . He was more familiar with Quanah Parker , the Comanche , with Elias Boudinot and General Stand Waitie , his brother , both full-blooded Cherokees , than he was with the names of Lincoln and Washington . Sabra , in her turn , undertook to wipe this impression from the boy 's mind . " Indians are bad people . They take little boys from their mammas and never bring them back . They burn down people 's houses , and hurt them . They 're dirty and lazy , and they steal . " She was unprepared for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy grew white with rage . " They 're not . You 're a liar . I hate you . I wo n't ride with you . " He actually prepared to climb down over the wagon wheel . She clutched at him with one hand , shook him smartly , cuffed him . He kicked her . She stopped the team , wound the reins , took him over her knee and spanked him soundly . He announced , through his tears , that he was going to run away and join the Indians and never come back . If she could have known that his later6olife was to be shaped by Yancey 's tales and this incident , certainly her protests would have been even more forcefulthan they were . " Why ca n't you talk to him about something besides those dirty thieving Indians ? There 's enough to teach him about the history of his country , I should think . George Washington and Jefferson Davis and Captain John Smith ... " " The one who married Pocahontas , you mean ? " " I declare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " O  --  othing . " But often the days were gay enough . They fell into the routine , adjusted themselves to the discomfort . At first Sabra had been so racked with the jolting of the wagon that she was a cripple by night . Yancey taught her how to relax ; not to brace herself against the wagon 's jolting but to sway easily with it . By the second day her young body had accustomed itself to the motion . She actually began to enjoy it , and at the journey 's end missed it as a traveler at sea misses the roll and dip of a ship . By this time she had the secondbestgray cheviot open at the throat and her hair in a long black braid . She looked like a schoolgirl . She had got out the sunbonnet which one of the less formidable Venables had jokingly given her at parting , and this she wore to shield her eyes from the pitiless glare of sky and plain . The gray straw bonnet , with its puff of velvet and its bird , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The sight of her in that prairie wilderness engaged in the domestic task of beating up a bowl of biscuit dough struck no one as being incongruous . The bread supply61was early exhausted . She baked in a little portable tin oven that Yancey had fitted out for her . As for Yancey himself , Sabra had never known him so happy . He was tireless , charming , varied . She herself was fascinated by his tales of hidden mines , of Spanish doubloons , of iron chests plowed up by some gaunt homesteader 's hand plow hitched to a stumbling mule . Yancey roared snatches of cowboy songs : whistle , its snap . The coiled thing lay in ribbons . Isaiah , though ashen with fright , still had to be forcibly restrainedfrom prowling among the mass for the rattlers which , with some combination of sunset and human saliva , were supposed to be a charm against practically every misfortune known to man . Cim had nightmare all that night and awoke screaming . Once they saw the figure of a solitary horseman deleted linesthat a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They had two days of rain during which they plodded miserably , inch by inch . Cim squalled , Isaiah became just a shivering black lump of misery , and Sabra thought of her dimity-hung bed back home in Wichita ; of the garden in the cool of the evening ; of the family gathered in the dining room ; of the pleasant food , the easy talk , the luxurious ease . " Lak yo ' breakfus ' in bed , Miss Sabra ? Mizzly mo'nin ' . " At Pawnee Yancey saw fresh deer tracks . He saddle a horse and was off . They had , before this , caught bass in the streams , and Yancey had shot prairie chicken and quail , and Sabra had fried them delicately . But this was their first promise of big game . Sabra felt no fear at being left alone with the two children . It was midafternoon . She was happy , peaceful . There was about this existence a delightful detachment . Her prim girlhood , which , because she had continued to live in her parents @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now behind her . Ahead of her lay all manner of unknown terrors and strangeness , but here in the wilderness she was secure . She ruled her little world . Her husband was hers , alone . Her child , too . The little black boy Isaiah was as much her slave as though the EmancipationProclamation had never been . Here , in the wide freedom of the prairie , she was , temporarily at least , suspended out of the reach of human interference . Now she welcomed this unexpected halt . She and Isaiah carried water from the creek and washed a few bits of clothes and hung them to dry . She bathed Cim . She heated water for herself and bathed gratefully . She set Isaiah to gathering fuel for the evening meal , , 64while Cim played in the shade of the clump of scrub oak . She was quite serene . She listened for the sound of horse 's hoofs that would announce Yancey 's triumphant return . She could hear Cim as he played under the trees , crooning to himself some snatch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to wonder if Yancey should not have returned by now . She brushed her hair thoroughly , enjoying the motion , throwing it over her head and bending far forward in that contortionistic attitude required by her task . After she had braided it she decided to leave it in a long thick plait down her back . Audaciously she tied it with a bright red ribbon , smiling to think of what Yancey would say . She tidied the wagon . She was frankly worried now . Nothing could happen . Of course nothing could happen . And in another part of her mind she thought that any one of a dozen dreadful things could happen . Indians . Why not ? Some wild thing in the woods . Broken bones . A fall from his horse . He might lose his way . Suppose she had to spend the night alone here on the prairie with the two children . Here was the little clump of scrub oaks . The land just beyond showed a series of tiny hillocks that rolled gently away toward the horizo  --  olled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head perhaps even now peering craftily over the slope 's edge to see what it could see . In a sudden panic she stepped out of the wagon with the feeling that she must have her own human things near her Cim , Isaia  --  o talk to . Cim was not thereplaying with his bits of stone and twigs . He had gone off with Isaiah to gather fuel , though she had forbidden it . Isaiah , his long arms full of dead twigs and small65branches , was coming toward the wagon now . Cim was not with him . " Where 's Cim ? " He dropped his load , looked around . " I lef ' him playin ' by hisself right hyah when Ah go fetch de wood . Ain ' he in de wagon ? " " No . No . " " Might be he crep ' in de print wagon . " " Wagon ? " She ran to the other wagon , peered inside , called . He was not there . Together they looked under the wagons , behind the trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are hiding I shall punish you if you do n't come out this minute . A shrill note of terror crept into her voice . She began to run up and down , calling him . She began to scream his name , her voice cracking grotesquely . Cim ! Cim ! She prayed as she ran , mumblingly. 0 God , help me find him . 0 God , do n't let anything happen to him . Dear God , help me find hi  --  im ! Cim ! Cim ! She had heard among pioneer stories that of the McAlastair wagon train crossing the continent toward California in ' 49 . The Benson party had got separated perhaps a half day 's journey from the front section when scouts brought news of Indians on the trail . Immediatelythey must break camp and hurry on to join the section ahead for mutual protection . In the midst of the bustle and confusion it was discovered that a child ? a boy of thre  --  as missing . The whole party searched at first confidently , then frenziedly , then despairingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ small children and another on the way . Every second 's delay meant possible death to every other member of the66party . They must push on . They appealed to the mother . " I 'll go on , " she said , and the wagon train wound its dusty way across the plains . The woman sat ashen faced , stony , her eyes fixed in a kind of perpetual horror . She never spoke of the child again . O God ! whimpered Sabra , running this way and that . O God ! Oh , Cim ! Cim ! She came to a little mound that dipped suddenly and unexpectedly to a draw . And there , in a hollow , she came upon him , seated before a cave in the side of the hill , the front and roof ingeniously timbered to make a log cabin . One might pass within five feet of it and never find it . Four men were seated about the doorstep outside the rude cabin . Cim was perched on the knee of one of them , who was cracking nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nuts and having altogether a delightful time of it . Sabra 's knees suddenly became weak . She was trembling . She stumbled as she ran toward him . Her face worked queerly.The men sprang up , their hands at their hips . " The man is cracking nuts for me , " remarked Cim , sociably , and not especially glad to see her . The man on whose knee he sat was a slim young fellow with a sandy mustache and a red handkerchief knotted cowboy fashion around his throat . He put the boy down gently as Sabra came up , and rose with a kind of easy grace . " You ran awa  --  o  --  e hunted ever  --  im she stammered , and burst into tears of mingled anger and relief . The slim young man seemed the spokesman , though the other three were obviously older than he. 67t " Why , I 'm real sorry you was distressed , ma'am . We was going to bring the boy back safe enough . He wandered down here lookin ' for his pa , he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tenderly , on Cim 's head , and looking down at Sabra with a smile of utter sweetness . His was the soft-spoken , almost caressingvoice of the Southwestern cowman and ranger . At this Sabra 's anger , born of fright , vanished . Besides , he was so youn  --  carcely more than a boy . " Well , " she explained , a little sheepishly , " I was worried . . . . My husband went off on the track of a deer . . . hours ago . . . he has n't come back . . . then when Cim . . . I came out and he was gone . . . . I was s  --  o terribly . . . " She looked very wan and schoolgirlish in her prim gray dress and with her hair in a braid tied with a bright red ribbon , and her tear-stained cheeks . One of the men who had strolled off a little way with the appearance of utmost casualness returned to the group in time to hear this . " He 'll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He did n't get no deer . " " But how do you know ? " The soft-spoken young man shot a malignant look at the other , and the older man looked suddenly abashed . Sabra 's question went unanswered . " Wo n't you sit and rest yourself , ma'am ? " suggested the spokesman . The words were hospitable enough , yet there was that in the boy 's tone which conveyed to Sabra the suggestion that she and Cim had better be gone . She took Cim 's hand . Now that her fright was past she thought she must have looked very silly running down the draw with her tears and her pigtail and her screaming . She68thanked them , using a little Southern charm and Southern drawl , which she often legitimately borrowed from the ancestral Venables for special occasions such as this . " I 'm ve'y grateful to you-all , " she now said . " You 've been mighty kind . If you would just drop around to our camp I 'm sure my husband would be delighted to meet you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the others looked at him , an inexplicable glint of humor in their weather-beaten faces . " I sure thank you , ma'am . We 're movin ' on , my friends here and me . Pronto . Floyd , how about you getting a piece of deer meat for the lady , seeing she 's been cheated of her supper . Now , if you and the little fella do n't mind sittin ' up behind and before , why , I 'll take you back a ways . You probably run fu'ther than you expected , ma'am , scared as you was . " She had , as a matter of fact , in her terror , run almost half a mile from camp . He mounted first . His method of accomplishing this was something of a miracle . At one moment the horse was standing ready and he was at its side . The next there was a flash , and he was on its back . It was like an optical illusion in which he seemed to have been drawn to the saddle as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the pommel , holding him with one hand ; Sabra , perched on the horse 's rump , clung with both arms round the lad 's slim waist . Something of a horsewoman , she noticed his fine Mexican saddle , studded with silver . From the sides of the saddle hung hair-covered pockets whose bulge was the outline of a gun . A slicker such as is69the knee of one of them as though he 'd known him allhis life eating nuts . . . . Anything might have happened Hto him and to me while you were off after your old . deer . " Yancey seemed less interested in the part that she and Cim had played in the adventure than in the appearance and behavior of the four men in the draw , and especially the charming young man who had so gal-lantlybrought them back . it " Thin faced , was he ? And a youngster ? About Inineteen or twenty ? What else ? " 1 ' ' " Oh , a low voice , and kind of sweet , as though he sang tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were n't they ? The two at the side , I mean . Like a wolf 's ? " " Yes . How did you Do you know him ? " " Sort of , " Yancey answered , thoughtfully . Sabra was piqued . " It was lucky for us it was some-one I ! who knows you , probably . Because you do n't seem jlto care much about what happened to u  --  hat might have happened . " " You said you wanted to go a-pioneering . " " Well ? " u " This is it . Stir that fire , Isaiah . Sabra , get that deer meat a-frizzling that your friend gave you . Becausewe 're moving on . " " Now ? To-night ? But it 's late . I thought we were camping here for the night . " " We 'll eat and get going . Moonlight to-night . I do n't just like it here . There 's been a lot of time lostthis afternoon . We 'll push on . In another day or so , L 1 with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ safe . " 71carried by those who ride the trails made a compact ship-shape roll behind the saddle . The horse had a velvet gait , even with this triple load . Sabra found herself wishing that this exhilarating ride might go on for miles . Suddenly she noticed that the young rider wore gloves . The sight of them made her vaguely uneasy , as though some memory had been stirred . She had never seen a plainsman wearing gloves . It was absurd , somehow . A hundred feet or so from the camp he reined in his horse abruptly , half turned in his saddle , and with his free hand swung Sabra gently to the ground , leaning far from his saddle and keeping a firm hold on Cim and reins as he did so . He placed the child in her upraised arms , wheeled , and was gone before she could open her lips to frame a word of thanks . The piece of deer meat , neatly wrapped , lay on the ground at her feet . She stood staring after the galloping figure @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ran toward the camp . Isaiah had a fire going , a pot of coffee bubbling . His greeting to Cim was sternly admonitory . Ten minutes later Yancey galloped in , empty handed . " What a chase he led me ! Twice I thought I had him . I 'd have run him into Texas if I had n't thought you 'd beSabra , for the first time since her marriage , felt superior to him ; was impatient of his tale of prowess . She had her own story to tell , spiced with indignation . She was not interested in his mythical deer . She had an actual piece of fresh deer meat to cook for their supper. " ... and just when I was ready to die with fright , there he was , talking to those four men , and sitting on70They ate hurriedly . Yancey seemed restless , anxious to be off . They jolted on . Cim slept , a little ball of weariness , in the back of the wagon . Isaiah drowsed beside Sabra , and she herself was half asleep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sun-warmed prairie came up to her , and the pungent smell of the sagebrush . The Indians had swept over this plain in hordes ; and buffalo by the millions . She wondered if the early Span ards , , in their lust for gold , had trod this groun  --  , rhaps this very trail . Coronado , De Soto , Narvaez . She had seen pictures of them , these dark-skinned elegantes in their cumbersome trappings of leather and heavy metal , tramping the pitiless plains of this vast Southwest , searching like children for cities of gold . . . . The steady clop-clop of the horses ' feet , the rattle of the wagon , the squeak of the wheels , the smell of sunbakedearth .. . She must have dozed off , for suddenly the sun 's rays were sharply slanted , and she shivered with the cool of the prairie night air . Voices had awakened her . Three horsemen had dashed out of a little copse and stood in the path of Yancey 's lead wagon . They were heavily armed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grim . They wore the mournful mustaches of the Western plainsman , their eyes were the eyes of men accustomed to great distances ; their gaze was searing . All three wore the badge of United States marshals , but there was about them something that announced this even before the eye was caught by their badge of office . The leader addressed Yancey , his voice mild , even gentle. 72 " Howdy . " " Howdy . " " Where you bound for , pardner ? " " Osage . " The questioner 's hand rested lightly on the butt of the six-shooter at his waist . " What might your name be ? " " Crava  --  ancey Cravat . " The spokesman 's face lighted up with the slow , increduloussmile of a delighted child . " I 'll be doggoned ! " He turned his slow grin on the man at his right , on the man at his left . " Yancey Cravat ! " he said again , as though they had not heard . " I sure am pleased to make your acquaintance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you . " " Why , thanks , " replied Yancey , unusually modest and laconic . Sabra knew then that Yancey was playing one of his roles . He would talk as they talked . Be one of them . " Aimin ' to make quite a stay in Osage ? " " Aim to live there . " " Go on ! I 've a notion to swear you in as Deputy Marshal right now , darned if I ai n't . Citizens like you is what we need , and no mistake . Lawy'in ' ? " " I 'm planning to take up my law practice in Osage , yes , " Yancey answered , " and start a newspaper as well . " The three looked a little perturbed at this . They glanced at each other , then at Yancey , then away , uncomfortably . " Oh , newspaper , huh ? " There was little enthusiasm in the marshal 's voice . " Well , we did have a newspaper there for a little while in Osage , ' bout a week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There was something sinister in this . " What became of it ? " " Well , seems the edito  --  ame of Pegle  --  ied . " There was a little silence . Sabra gathered up her reins and brought her team alongside Yancey 's , the better to hear . The three mustached ones acknowledged her more formal presence by briefly touching their hat brims with the forefinger of the hand that had rested on their guns . " Who killed him ? " A little shadow of pained surprise passed over the features of the marshal . " He was just found dead one morning on the banks of the Canadian . Bullet wounds . But bullets is all pretty much alike , out here . He might ' a ' killed himself , plumb discouraged . " The silence fell again . Yancey broke it . " The first edition of the Oklahoma Wigwam will be off the press two weeks from to-morrow . " He gathered up the reins as though to end this chance meeting , however agreeable . " Well , gentlemen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three did not budge . " What we stopped to ask you , " said the spokesman , in his gentle drawl , " was , did you happen to glimpse four men anywhere on the road ? They 're nesting somewheres in here , the Kid and his gang . Stole four horses , robbed the bank at Red Fork , shot the cashier , and lit out for the prairie . Light complected , all of ' em . The Kid is a slim young fella , light hair , red handkerchief , soft spoken , and rides with gloves on . But then you know what he 's like , Cravat , well 's I do . " 741Yancey nodded in agreement . " Everybody 's heard of the Kid . No , sir , I have n't seen him . Have n't seen anybody the last three days but a Kaw on a pony and a bunch of dirty Cheyennes in ' a wagon . Funny thing , I never yet knew a bad marl who was n't light complecte  --  r , anyway , blue or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " protested the marshal , stroking his sandy mustache . " Fact . You take the Kid , and the James boys , and Tom O'Phalliard , and the whole Mullins gang . " " How about yourself ? You 're pretty good with the gun , from all accounts . And black as a crow . " Yancey lifted his great head and the heavy lids that usually drooped over the gray eyes and looked at the marshal . " That 's so , " said the other , as though in agreement at the end of an argument . " I reckon it goes fur killers and fur killers of killers . . . . Well , boys , we 'll be lopin ' . Good luck to you . " " Good luck to you ! " responded Yancey , politely . The three whirled their steeds spectacularly , raised their right hands in salute ; the horses pivoted on their hind legs prettily ; Cim crowed with delight . They were off in a cloud of red dust made redder by the last rays of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stared at him in bewildered indignation . " But the person who shields a criminal is just as bad as the criminal himself , is n't he ? " Yancey looked back at her around the side of his wagon top . His smile was mischievous , sparkling , irresistible . " Do n't be righteous , Sabra . It 's middle clas  --  nd a terrible trait in a woman . " 75 lLate next day , just before sunset , after pushing on relentlessly through the blistering sun of midday , Yancey pointed with his wagon whip to something that looked like a wallow of mud dotted with crazy shanties and tents . Theatrically he picked Cim up in his arms so that the child , too , might see . But he spoke to Sabra . " There it is , " he said . " That 's our future home . " Sabra looked . And her brain seemed to have no order or reason about it , for she could think only of the green nun 's veiling trimmed with ruchings of pink which lay so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with soft paper , in the trunk under the canvas of the wagon. 76viLONG before the end of that first nightmarish day in Osage , Sabra had confronted her husband with blazing eyes . " I wo n't bring up my boy in a town like this ! " It had been a night and a day fantastic with untowardhappenings . Their wagons had rumbled wearily down the broad main street of the settlemen  --  raw gash in the prairie . All about , on either side , were wooden shacks , and Indians and dried mud and hitchingposts and dogs and crude wagons like their own . It looked like pictures Sabra had seen of California in ' 49 ? They had supped on ham and eggs , fried potatoes , and muddy coffee in a place labeled Ice Cream and Oyster Parlor . They spent that first night in a rooming house above one of the score of saloons that enlivened the main stree  --  awhuska Avenue , it was called . It was a longish street , for the Osage town settlers seemed to have felt the need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street stopped abruptly at either end and became suddenly prairie . " Pawhuska Avenue , " said a tipsy sign tacked on thefront of a false-front pine shack . Yancey chose this unfortunate time to impart a little Indian lore to Cim , wide eyed on the wagon seat beside his mother . " That 's Osage , " he shouted to the boy . " Pawhuthatmeans hair . And scab , that means white . White Hair . Pawhusk  --  hite Hai  --  as an old OsageChief " Yancey Cravat ! " Sabra called in a shout that almost equaled his own , and in a tone startlingly like one of Felice Venable 's best ( she was , in fact , slightly hysterical , what with weariness and disappointment and fear ) , " Yancey Cravat , will you stop talking Indian history and find us a place to eat and sleep ! Where 's your sense ? Ca n't you see he 's ready to drop , and so am I ? " The greasy food set before them in the eating house sickened her . She shrank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in front of them on the oilcloth-covered table . At this same table with them ? there was only one , a long board accommodating perhaps twent  --  at red-faced men talking in great rough voices , eating with a mechanical and absentmindedthoroughness , shoveling potatoes , canned vegetables , pie into their mouths with knives . Cim was terribly wide awake and noisily unruly , excited by the sounds and strangeness about him . " I 'm an Indian ! " he would yell , making a great clatterwith his spoon on the table . " 01 ' White Hair ! Wawa-wa-wa-wa-wa-wa ! " Being reprimanded , and having the spoon forcibly removed from his clutching fingers , he burst into tears and howls . Sabra had taken him up to the bare and clean enough little room which was to be their shelter for the night . From wide-eyed wakefulness Cim had become suddenly limp with sleep . Yancey had gone out to see to the horses , to get what information he could about renting a house , and a shack for the newspaper . A score of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be all right , " he had said . " A good night 's sleep and everything 'll look rosy in the morning . Don'tlook so down in the mouth , honey . You 're going to like r I it . " " It 's horrible ! It '  --  nd those men ! Those dreadful men . " " For my part , I had rather be the first man among these fellows than the second man in Rome . ' Yancey struck an attitude . Sabra looked at him dully . " Rome ? " " Plutarch , my sweet . " He kissed her ; was gone with a great flirt of his coat tails . She heard his light step clattering down the flimsy wooden stairs . She could distinguish his beautiful vibrant voice among the raucousspeech of the other men below . The boy was asleep in a rude box bed drawn up beside theirs . Black Isaiah was bedded down somewhere in a little kennel outside . Sabra sank suspiciously down on the doubtful mattress . The walls of the room werewafer thin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came women 's shrill laughter , the sound of a piano hammered horribly . Horses clattered by . Voices came up in jocose greeting ; there were conversationsand arguments excruciatingly prolonged beneath her window . " I was sellin ' a thousand beef steers one timeholdin ' a herd of about three thousan  --  nd me and 78 791R R O Ning again but the clink of glasses and plates ; the tinny piano , the slap of cards . She longed with unutterable longing , not for the sweet security of her bed back in Wichit  --  hat seemed unreal no  --  ut for those nights in the wagon on the prairie with no sound but the rustle of the scrub oaks , the occasional stamp of horses ' hoofs on dry clay , the rippling of a near-by stream . She looked at her littlegold watch , all engraved with a bird and a branch and a waterfall and a church spire . It was only nine . It was midnight when Yancey came in . She sat up in bed in her high-necked , long-sleeved nightgown . Hereyes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a piece of paper . " What was it ? What was it ? " " What was what ? Why are n't you asleep , sugar ? " " Those shots . And the screaming . And the men holler-ing . " " Shots ? " He was unstrapping his broad leather belt with its twin six-shooters whose menacing heads peered just above their holsters . He wore it always now . It came , in time , to represent for her a sinister symbol of all the terrors , all the perils that lay waiting for them in this new existence . " Why , sugar , I do n't recollect hearing any O  --  hat ! " He threw back his great head and laughed . " That was just a cowboy , feeling high , shooting out the lights over in Strap Turket'ssaloon . On his way home and having a little fun with the boys . Scare you , did it ? " He came over to her , put a hand on her shoulder . She shrugged away from him , furious . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cold and wet. 8rmy foreman , we was countin ' the cattle as they come between us .

" " Heard where the Mullins gang rode in there this morning and cleaned up the tow  --  oth bank  --  leven thousand in one and nineteen thousand in the other , and when they come out it looked like the whole county 'd rallied against ' em . . . . " " Say , he 's a bad hombre , that fella . Got a poisoned tongue , like a rattlesnake . . . . Spades trump ? " " No , hearts . Say , I would of known how to handle him . One time we was campirt ' on Amarillo Creek . . . " A loud knock at the door opposite Sabra 's room . The knock repeated . Then a woman 's voice , metallic , high . " Quien es ? Quien es ? " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's gruff voice . A long-drawn wail in the street below , " Oh , Joe ! He-e-e-ere 's your mule ! " followed by a burst of laughter . Yet somehow she had fallen asleep in utter exhaustion , only to be awakened by pistol shots , a series of blood-curdling yells , the crash and tinkle of broken glass . Then came screams of women , the sound of horses galloping . She lay there , cowering . Cim stirred in his bed , sighed deeply , slept again . She was too terrified to go to the window . Her shivering seemed to shake the bed . She wanted to waken the child for comfort , for company . She summoned courage to go to the window ; peered fearfully out into the dim street below . Nothing . No one in the street . Yancey 's bleeding body was not lying in the road ; no masked men . Noth-8oShe was panting a little . " 1 wo n't bring my boy up in a town like this . I wo n't . I 'm going back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? ? " Wait till morning , anyhow , wo n't you , honey. he said , and took her in his arms . Next morning was , somehow , magically , next morning , with the terrors of the night vanished quite . The sun was shining . For a moment Sabra had the illusion that she was again at home in her own bed at Wichita , Then she realized that this was because she had been awakened by a familiar sound . It was the sound of Isaiah 's voice somewhere below in the dusty yard . He was polishing Yancey 's boots , spitting on them industriouslyand singing as he rubbed . His husky sweet voice came up to her as she lay there . Lis'en to de lambs , all a-cryin ' Lis'en to de lambs , all a-cryin ' Lis'en to de lambs , all a-cryin ' , Ah wanta go to heab'n when ah die . Come on , sister , wid yo ' ups an ' downs , Wanta go to heab'n when ah die , De angels waitin ' fo ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heab'n when ah die . Lugubrious though the words were , Sabra knew he wasutterly happy . There was much to be don  --  dwelling to be gotsomeho  --  place in which to house the newspaperplant . If necessary , Yancey said , they could live in therear and set up the printing and law office in the front . Almost everyone who conducted a business in the towndid this . " Houses are mighty scarce , " Yancey said , making a great masculine snorting and snuffling at the wash8zJbowl as they dressed . " It 's take what you can get or live in a tent . I heard last night that Doc Nisbett 's got a good house . Five rooms , and he 'll furnish us with water . There 're a dozen families after it , and Doc 's as independent as a hog on ice . " Sabra rather welcomed this idea of combining office and home . She would be near him all day . As soon as breakfast was over she and Yancey fared forth , leaving Cim in Isaiah 's care ( under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on her black grosgrainsilk with the three box pleats on each side , trimmed with the passementerie and jet buttons ? somewhat wrinkled from its long stay in the trunk ? and her modish hat with the five ostrich plumes and the pink roses that had cost twelve dollars and fifty cents in Wichita , and her best black buttoned kid shoes and her black kid gloves . In the tightly basqued black silk she was nineteen inches round the waist and very proud of it . Her dark eyes , slightly shadowed now , what with weariness , excitement , and loss of sleep , were enormous beneath the brim of the romantic black plumed hat . Yancey , seeing her thus attired in splendor after almost a fortnight of the gray cheviot , struck an attitudeof dazzlement . Blank verse leaped to his ready lips . " But who is this , what thing of land or sea , ? female of sex it seem  --  hat so bedeck 'd , ornate , and gay , comes this way sailing , like a stately ship of Tarsus , bound @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her bravery on ....

" 83 ments in which Sabra had seen the women back home in Wichita hanging up the Monday wash to dry on the line in the back yard . Here they came out of butcher 's shop or grocery store with the day 's provisions in their arms ; a packet of meat , tins of tomatoes or peaches , unwrapped . After sharp furtive glances at Sabra , they vanished into this little pine shack or that . Immediately afterward there was great agitation among the prim coarse window curtains in those dwellings boasting such elegance . " But the other  --  he other kind of women Sabra faltered . Yancey misunderstood . " Plenty of the other kind in a town like this , but they are n't stirring this time of day . " Do n't be coarse , Yancey . I mean ladies like myself ? that I can talk t  --  ho 'll come callin  --  hat is He waved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you just saw some women folks , did n't you ? " " Those ! " " Well , now , honey , you ca n't expect those ladies to be wearing their best bib and tucker mornings to do the housework in . Besides , most of the men came without their women folks . They 'll send for them , and then you 'll have plenty of company . It is n't every woman who 'd have the courage you showed , roughing it out here . You 're the stuff that Rachel was made of , and the mother of the Gracchi . " Rachel was , she knew , out of the Bible ; she was a little hazy about the Gracchi , but basked serene in the knowledge that a compliment was intended . There was the absurdly wide stree  --  urely fifty " You 're right , my darling . Even Milton has no wordsfor such beauty . " " Do hurry , dear . We 've so much to do . " With his curling locks , his broad-brimmed white sombrero , his high-heeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his Prince Albert spreading and swooping with the vigor of his movements , Yancey was an equally striking figure , though perhaps not so unusualas she , in this day and place . The little haphazard town lay broiling in the summer sun . The sky that Sabra was to know so well hung flat and glaring , a gray-blue metal disk , over the prairie . " Well , Sabra honey , this is n't so bad ! " exclaimed Yancey , and looked about him largely . " Now Morning saffron-robed arose from the streams of Ocean to bring light to gods and men . ' " Ocean ! " echoed Sabra , the literal . " Mighty little water I 've seen around her  --  nless you call that desert prairie the ocean . " " And so it is , my pet . That 's very poetic of you . The prairie 's an ocean of land . " He seemed enormously elate  --  ubilant , almost . His coat tails switched ; he stepped high in his fine Texas star boots . She tucked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was sweet , and they were young , and it was morning . Perhapsit was not going to be so dreadful , after all . Somehow , she had yet no feeling that she , Sabra Cravat , was part of this thing . She was an onlooker . The first thing she noticed , as she stepped into the dust of the street in her modish dress and hat , caused her heart to sink . The few women to be seen scuttling about wore sunbonnets and calic  --  he kind of gar-deleted linesHills , or the Osage , swooping down from their hidden haunts to terrorize a town , shoot up a bank , hold up a train , and dash out again , leaving blood behind them . They risked their lives for a few hundred dollars . Here was a vast domain without written laws , without precedent , without the customs of civilization ; part of a great country , yet no part of its government . Here a horse was more valuable than a human life . A horse thief , caught , was summarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man often went free . Down the street these two stepped in their finery . the man swaggering a little as a man should in a white sombrero and with a petty woman on his arm ; the woman looking about her interestedly , terrified at what she saw and determined not to show it . If two can be said to make a procession , then Yancey and Sabra Cravat formed quite a parade as they walked down Pawhuska Avenue in the blaze of the morning sun . Certainly they seemed to be causing a stir . Lean rangers in buckboards turned to stare . Loungers in doorways nudged each other , yawping . Cowboys clattering by whooped a greeting . It was unreal , absurd , grotesque . " Hi , Yancey ! Howdy , ma'am . " Past the Red Dog Saloon . A group in chairs tilted up against the wall or standing about in high-heeled boots and sombreros greeted Yancey now with a familiarity that astonished Sabra . " Howdy , Cim ! Hello , Yancey ! " " He called you Cim ! " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he passed . " Boys are up to something . If they try to get funny while you 're here with me . . . " 88Sabra , glancing at the group from beneath her shieldinghat brim , did see that they were behaving much like a lot of snickering schoolboys who are preparing to let fly a bombardment of snowballs . There was nudging , there was whispering , an air of secret mischief afoot . " Why are the  --  hat do you think makes them " Sabra began , a trifle nervously . " Oh , they 're probably fixing up a little initiation for me , " Yancey explained , his tone light but his eye wary . " Do n't get nervous . They wo n't dare try any monkeyshineswhile you 're with me . " " But who are they ? " He evaded her question . She persisted . " Who are they ? " " I ca n't say for sure . But I suspect they 're the boys that did Pegler dirt . " " Pegler ? Who i  --  h @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the one who was found dea  --  hot dead on the banks of the Yancey ! Do you mean they did it ! " " I do n't say they did i  --  xactly . They know more than is comfortable , even for these parts . I was inquiringaround last night , and everybody shut up like aclam . I 'm going to find out who killed Pegler and print it in the first number of the Oklahoma Wigwam . " " Oh , Yancey ! Yancey , I 'm frightened ! " She clung tighter to his arm . The grinning mirthless faces of the men on the saloon porch seemed to her like the fanged and snarling muzzles of wolves in a pack . " Nothing to be frightened of , honey . They know me . I 'm no Pegler they can scare . They do n't like my white hat , that 's the truth of it . Dared me last night down at the Sunny Southwest Saloon to wear it this morning. 89Just to try me out . They wo n't have the guts to come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra heard a curious buzzing sound past her ear . Something sang ? zing ! Yancey 's white sombrero went spinning into the dust of the road . Sabra 's mouth opened as though she were screaming , but the sounds she would have made emerged , feebly , as a croak . " Stay where you are , " Yancey ordered , his voice low and even . " The dirty dogs . " She stood transfixed . She could not have run if she had wanted to . Her legs seemed suddenly no part'of he  --  emote , melting beneath her , and yet pricked with a thousand pins and needles . Yancey strolled leisurely over to where the white hat lay in the dust . He stooped carelessly , his back to the crowd on the saloon porch , picked up the hat , surveyed it , and reached toward his pocket for his handkerchief . At that movement there was a rush and a scramble on the porch . Tilted chairs leaped forward , heels clattered , a door slammed . The white-aproned proprietor who , tray in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vanished as though he had been blotted out by blackness . Of the group only three men remained . One of these leaned insolently against a porch post , a second stood warily behind him , and a third was edging prudently toward the closed door.There was nothing to indicate who had fired the shot that had sent Yancey 's hat spinning . Yancey , now half turned toward them , had taken his fine white handkerchief from his pocket , had shaken out its ample folds with a gesture of elegant leisure , 90and , hat in hand , was flicking the dust from his headgear . This done he surveyed the hat critically , seemed to find it little the worse for its experience unless , perhaps , one excepts the two neat round holes that were drilled , back and front , through the peak of its crown . He now placed it on his head again with a gesture almost languid , tossed the fine handkerchief into the road , and with almost the same gesture , or with another so lightning quick that Sabra 's eye @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There was the crack of a shot . The man who was edging toward the door clapped his hand to his ear and brought his hand away and looked at it , and it was darkly smeared . Yancey still stood in the road , his hand at his thigh , one slim foot , in its fine high-heeled Texas star boot , advanced carelessly . His great head was lowered menacingly . His eyes , steel gray beneath the brim of the white sombrero , looked as Sabra had never before seen them look . They were terrible eyes , merciless , cold , hypnotic . She could only think of the eyes of the rattler that Yancey had whipped to death with the wagon whip on the trip across the prairie . " A three-cornered piece , you 'll find it , Lon . The Cravat sheep brand . " " Ca n't you take a joke , Yancey ? " whined one of the three , his eyes on Yancey 's gun hand . " Jok  --  ell ! " snarled the man who had been nicked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God help you , Cravat . " " He always has , " replied Yancey , piously . " If your missus was n't with you " began the man whom Yancey had called Lon . Perhaps the rough joke would have ended grimly enough . But here , sud-91denly , Sabra herself took a hand in the proceedings . Her fright had vanished . These were no longer men , evil , sinister , to be feared , but mean little boys to be put in their place . She now advanced on them in the majesty of her plumes and her silk , her fine eyes flashing , her gloved forefinger admonishing them as if they were indeed naughty children . She was every inch the descendant of the Marcys of France and the very essenceof that iron woman , Felice Venable . " Do n't you missus ' me ! You 're a lot of miserable , good-for-nothing loafers , that 's what you are ! Shooting at people in the streets . You leave my husband alone . I declare , I 've a notion toFor one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slap the leathery bearded cheek of the bad man known as Lon Yountis . Certainly she raised her little hand in its neat black kid . The eyes of the three were popping . Lon Yountis ducked his head exactly like an urchin who is about to be smacked by the schoolmarm . Then , with a yelp of pure terror he fled into the saloon , followed by the other two . Sabra stood a moment . It really looked as though she might make after them . But she thought better of it and sailed down the steps in triumph to behold a crushed , a despairing Yancey . " Oh , my God , Sabra ! What have you done to me ! " " What 's the matter ? " " This time to-morrow it 'll be all over the whole Southwest , from Mexico to Arkansas , that Yancey Cravat hid behind a woman 's petticoats . " " But you did n't . They ca n't say so . You shot him very nicely in the ear , darling . " Thus had a scant92 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so askew that she did not even notice the grotesquerie of what she had just said . " They 're telling it now , in there . My God , a woman 's got no call to interfere when men are having a little dis-pute . " " Dispute ! Why , Yancey Cravat ! He shot your hat right off your head ! " " What of it ! Little friendly shooting . " The enormity of this example of masculine clannishnessleft her temporarily speechless with indignation . " Let 's be getting on , " Yancey continued , calmly . " If we 're going to look at Doc Nisbett 's house we 'd better look at it . There are only two or three to be had in the whole town , and his is the pick of them . It 's central " ( Central ! she thought , looking about her ) " and according to what he said last night there 's a room in the front big enough for getting out the paper . It 'll have to be newspaper and law office in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to live in . Plenty . " " Oh , plenty , " echoed Sabra , thinking of the nine or ten visiting Venables always comfortably tucked away in the various high-ceilinged bedrooms in the Wichita house . They resumed their walk . Sabra wondered if she had imagined the shooting outside the Red Dog Saloon . Doc Nisbett ( veterinarian ) shirt sleeved , shrewd , with generations of New England ancestry behind him , was seated in a chair tipped up against the front of his coveted property . Nothing of the brilliant Southwestsun had mellowed the vinegar of his chemical make-up . In the rush for Territory town sites at thetime of the Opening he had managed to lay his gnarled hands on five choice pieces . On these he erected dwellings , tilted his chair up against each in turn , and took his pick of late-comers frantic for some sort of shelter they could call a home . That perjury , thieving , trickery , gun play , and murder had gone into the acquiring of thes  --  s well as many othe  --  ites was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The dwelling itself looked like one of Cim 's childish drawings of a house . The roof was an inverted V ; there was a front door , a side door , and a spindling little porch . It was a box , a shelter merely , as angular and unlovely as the man who owned it . The walls were no more than partitions , the floors boards laid on dirt . Taking her cue from Yancey ? " Lovely , " murmured Sabra , agonized . The mantel ornaments that had been Cousin Dabney 's wedding present ! The hand-woven monogrammed linen ! The silver cake dish with the carefree cupids . The dozen solid silver coffee spoons ! " Do very nicely . Perfectly comfortable . I see . I see . I see . " There you are ! " They stood again on the porch , the tour completed . Yancey clapped his hands together gayly , as though by so doing he had summoned a genie who had tossed up the house before their very eyes . In the discussion of monthly rental he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grasping New Englander . " There you are ! That 's all settled . " He struck an attitude . " Survey our empire , and behold our home ! ' " Heh , hold on a minute , " rasped Doc Nisbett . " How about water ? " 94 " Sabra , honey , you settle these little matters between yo  --  ou and the Do  --  ill you ? I 've got to run down the street and see Jesse Rickey about putting up the press and setting up the type racks and helping me haul the form tables , and then we 've got the furniture to buy for the house . Meet you down the street at Hefner 's Furniture Store . Ten minutes . " He was off , with a flirt of his coat tails . She would have called , " Yancey ! Do n't leave me ! " but for a prideful reluctance to show fear before this dourvisagedman with the tight lips and the gimlet eyes . From the first he had seemed to regard her with disfavor . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , his Puritan New England revulsion against her plumes , her silks , her faintly Latin beauty . " Well , now , " repeated Doc Nisbett , nasally , " about water . " " Water ? " " How much you going to need ? Renting this house depends on how much water you think you going to need . How many barrels . " Sabra had always taken water for granted , like air and sunshine . It was one of the elements . It was simply there . But since leaving Wichita there was always talk of water . Yancey , on the prairie journey , made it the basis of their camping site . " Oh , barrels , " she now repeated , trying to appear intensely practical . " Well , let ? m  --  ee . There 's cooking , of course , and all the cleaning around the house , and drinking , and bathing . I always give Cim his bath in the evening if I can . You would n't believe how dirty that child gets by the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  ell , I should think ten barrels a day would be enough . " " Ten barrels , " said Doc Nisbett , in a flat voice utterly devoid of expression , " a day . " " I should think that would be ample , " Sabra repeated , judiciously . Doc Nisbett now regarded Sabra with a look of active dislike . Then he did a strange thing . He walked across the little porch , shut the front door , locked it , put the key in his pocket , seated himself in the chair and tilted it up against the wall at exactly the angle at which they had come upon him . Sabra stood there . Seeing her , it would have been almost impossible to believe that anyone so bravely decked out in silk and plumes and pink roses could present a figure so bewildered , so disconsolate , so defeated . Literally , she did not know what to do . She had met and surmounted many strange experiences in these last ten days . But she had been born of generations of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all her life she had never encountered the slightest discourtesyin a man , much less this abysmal boorishness . She looked at him , her face white , shocked . She looked up , in embarrassment , at the glaring steel sky ; she looked down at the blinding red dust , she looked helplessly in the direction that Yancey had so blithely taken . She glanced again at Doc Nisbett , propped so woodenly against the wall of his hateful house . His eye was as cold , as glassy , as unseeing as the eye of a dead fish . She should , of course , have gone straight up to him and said , " Do you mean that ten barrels are too much ? 96I did n't know . I am new to all this . Whatever you say . " But she was young , and inexperienced , and full of pride , and terribly offended . So without another word she turned and marched down the dusty street . Her head in its plumed hat was high . On either cheek burned a scarlet patch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hot tears , were blazing , liquid , enormous . She saw nothing . From the saloons that lined the street there came , even at this hour of the morning , yelps and the sound of music . And then a fearful thing happened to Sabra Cravat . Down the street toward her came a galloping cowboy in sombrero and chaps and six-shooters . Sabra was used to such as he . Full of her troubles , she was scarcely aware that she had glanced at him . How could she know that he was just up from the plains of Texas , that this raw town represented for him the height of effete civilization , that he was , in celebration of his arrival , already howling drunk as befits a cowboy just off the range , and that never before in his life ( he was barely twenty-three ) had he seen a creature so gorgeous as this which now came toward him , all silk , plumes , roses , jet , scarlet cheeks , and great liquid eyes . lip he galloped ; stared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her in his high-heeled cowboy boots ( strangely enough all that Sabra could recall about him afterward were those boots as he came toward her . The gay tops were of shiny leather , and alternating around them was the figure of a dancing girl with flaring skirts , and a poker hand of cards which later she learned was a royal flush , all handsomely embossed on the patent leather cuffs of the boots ) . She realized , in a flash of pure terror , that he97arms atop the object nearest at hand . Her slim body shook with her sobs . Her tears flowed . She cried aloud like a child . But at that a plaintive but firm note of protest enteredMr . Hefner 's voice . " Excuse me , ma'am , but that 's velvet you 're crying on , and water spots velvet something terrible . If you 'd just lean on something else ... " She raised herself from the object on which she had collapsed , weeping , and looked at it with brimming eyes that widened in horror as she realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hefner 's Furnitureand Undertaking establishment , the newly arrived white velvet coffin ( child 's size ) intended for show window purposes alone. 1was making straight for her . She stood , petrified . He came nearer , he stood before her , he threw his arms like steel bands about her , he kissed her full on the lips , releasedher , leaped on his horse , and was off with a bloodcurdlingyelp and a clatter and a whirl of dust . She thought that she was going to be sick , there , in the road . Then she began to run , fleetly but awkwardly , in her flounced and bustled silken skirts . Hefner 's Furniture Store . Hefner 's Furniture Store . Hefner 's Furniture Store . She saw it at last . Hefner 's Furniture and Undertaking Parlors . A crude wooden shack , like the rest . She ran in . Yancey . Yancey ! Everythinglooked dim to her bewildered and sun-blinded eyes . Someone came toward her . A large moist man , in shirt sleeves . Hefner , probably . My husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , ma'am . Ai n't been in , I know of . Anything I can do for you , ma'am ? She blurted it , hysterically . " A ma  --  cowbo  --  was walking alon  --  e jumped off his hors  --   --  never saw him b he kissed m  --  here on the streetin broad dayligh  --  cowbo  --  e kissed " Why , ma'am , do n't take on so . Young fella off the range , prob'ly . Up from Texas , more'n likely , and never did see a gorgeous critter like yourself , if you 'll pardon my mentioning it . " Her voice rose in her hysteria . " You do n't understand ! He kissed me . He k-k-k-k racking sobs . " Now , now , lady . He was drunk , and you kind of went to his head . He 'll ride back to Texas , and you 'll be none the worse for it . " At this calloused viewpoint of a tragedy she broke down completely and buried her head on her folded 98 99viiFR7M Doc Nisbett , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rented by a family whose aquatic demands were more modest than Sabra 's . Sabra was inconsolable , but Yancey did not once reproach her for her mistake . It was characteristic of him that he was most charming and considerate in crises which might have been expected to infuriate him . " Never mind , sugar . Do n't take on like that . We 'll find a house . And , anyway , we 're here . That 's the main thing . God , when I think of those years in Wichita ! " " Why , Yancey ! I thought you were happy there . " " A prison 'd soul , lapped in Elysium . ' Almost five years in one plac  --  hat 's the longest stretch I 've ever done , honey . Five years , back and forth like a trail horse ; walking down to the Wigwam office in the morning , setting up personal and local items and writing editorials for a smug citizenry interested in nothing but the new waterworks . Walking back to dinner at noon , sitting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garden or the Venables in the house until Icould n't tell vegetables from Venables and began to think , by God , that I was turning into one or the other myself . " He groaned with relief , stretched his mighty arms , shook himself like a great shaggy lion . In all this welter of red clay and Indians and shirt sleeves and tobacco juice and drought he seemed to find a beauty and an exhilaration that eluded Sabra quite . But then Sabra , after those first two days , had ceased to search for a reason for anything . She met and accepted the most grotesque , the most fantastic happenings . When she looked back on the things she had done and the things she had said in the first few hours of her Oklahoma experienceit was as though she were tolerantly regarding the naivetes of a child . Ten barrels of water a day ! She knew now that water , in this burning land , was a precious thing to be measured out like wine . Life here was an anachronism , a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of the United States , in this year of 1889 , was living a conventionally civilized and primly Victorian existence , in which plumbing , gaslight , trees , gardens , books , laws , millinery , Sunday churchgoing , were taken for granted , here in this Oklahoma country life had been set back according to the frontier standards of half a century earlier . Literally she was pioneering in a wilderness surrounded but untouched by civilization . Yancey had reverted . Alway  --  ven in his staidest Wichita incarnatio  --  somewhat incredibly romantic figure , he now was remarkable even in this town of fantastichumans gathered from every corner of the brilliantlypicturesque Southwest . His towering form , hisIOIcurling locks , his massive head , his vibrant voice , his dashing dress , his florid speech , his magnetic personality drew attention wherever he went . On the day followingtheir arrival Yancey had taken from his trunk a pair of silver-mounted ivory-handled six-shooters and a belt and holster studded with silver . She had never before seen them . She had not known that he possessed these grim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a rattlesnake skin of gold and silver , with glass eyes , a treasure also produced from the secret trunk , as well as a pair of gold-mounted spurs which further enhanced the Texas star boots . Thus bedecked for his legal and editorial pursuits he was by far the best dressed and most spectacular male in all the cycloramic Oklahoma country . He had always patronized a good tailor , and because the local talent was still so limited in this new community he later sent as far as San Antonio , Texas , when his wardrobe needed replenishing . Sabra learned many astounding things in these first few days , and among the most terrifying were the things she learned about the husband to whom she had been happily married for more than five years . She learned , for example , that this Yancey Cravat was famed as the deadliest shot in all the deadly shooting Southwest . He had the gift of being able to point his six-shooters without sighting , as one would point with a finger . It was a direction-born gift in him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the few who could draw and fire two six-shooters at once with equal speed and accuracy . His hands would go to his hips with a lightninggesture that yet was so smooth , so economical , IO2that the onlooker 's eye scarcely followed it . He could hit his mark as he walked , as he ran , as he rode his horse . He practised a great deal . From the back door of their cabin Sabra and Cim and rolling-eyed Isaiah used to stand watching him . He sometimes talked of wind and trajectory . You had to make allowance mathematically , he said , for this ever-blowing Oklahoma wind . Sabra was vaguely uneasy . Wichita had not been exactly effete , and Dodge City , Kansas , was notoriously a gunplaytown . But here no man walked without his sixshootersstrapped to his body . On the very day of her harrowing encounter with Doc Nisbett and . the cowboy , Sabra , her composure regained , had gone with Yancey to see still another house owner about the possible rentingof his treasure . The man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a combination dwelling and land office . He and Yancey seemed to know each other . Sabra was no longer astonished to find that Yancey , twenty-four hours after his arrival , appeared to be acquainted with everyone in the town . The man glanced up at them from the rough pine table at which he was writing . " Howdy , Yancey ! " " Howdy , Cass ! " Yancey , all grace , performed an introduction . The lean , leather-skinned house owner wiped his palm on his pants ' seat in courtly fashion and , thus purified , extended a hospitable hand to Sabra . Yancey revealed to him their plight . " Well , now , say , that 's plumb terr'ble , that is . Might be I can help you ou  --  ou and your good lady here . But say , Yancey , just let me step out , will you , to the103corner , and mail this here letter . The bag 's goin ' any minute now . " He licked and stamped the envelope , rose , and took from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pair of holstered six-shooters , evidently temporarily laid aside for comfort while writing . This he now strapped quickly about his waist with the same unconcernthat another man would use in slipping into his coat . He merely was donning conventional street attire for the well-dressed man of the locality . He picked up his sheaf of envelopes and stepped out . In three minutes he was back , and affably ready to talk terms with them . It was , perhaps , this simple and sinister act , more than anything she had hitherto witnessed , that impressedSabra with the utter lawlessness of this new land to which her husband had brought her . This house , so dearly held by the man called Cass , turned out to be a four-room dwelling inadequate to their needs , and they were in despair at the thought of being obliged to wait until a house could be built . Then Yancey had a brilliant idea . He found a two-room cabin made of rough boards . This was hauled to the site of the main house , plastered , and added @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ newspaper plant , and law office . There was all the splendor of sitting room , dining room , bedroom , and kitchen to live in . One room of the small attached cabin was a combination law and newspaper office . The other served as composing room and print shop . The Hefner Furniture and Undertaking Parlors provided them with furnitur  --  large wooden bedstead to fit Sabra 's mattress and spring ; a small bed for Cim ; tables , chairs104 ? the plainest of everything . The few bits of furnishing and ornament that Sabra had brought with her from Wichita were fortunately or unfortunatel  --  ossessed of the enduring beauty of objects which have been carefullymade by hands exquisitely aware of line , texture , color , and further enhanced by the rich mellow patina that comes with the years . Her pieces of silver , of china , of fine linen were as out of place in this roughly furnished cabin of unpainted lumber as a court lady in a peasant 's hovel . In two days Sabra was a housewife established in her routine as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pan of biscuits in the oven of the wood-burning kitchen stove ; a dress pattern of calico , cut out and ready for basting , on the table in the sitting room . Setting up the newspaper plant and law office was not so simple . Yancey , for example , was inclined to write his first editorial entitled Whither Oklahoma ? before the hand press had been put together . He was more absorbed in the effect of the sign tacked up over the front of the shop than he was in the proper mechanical arrangement of the necessary appliances inside . THE OKLAHOMA WIGWAM , read the sign in block letters two feet high , so that the little cabin itself was almost obscured . Then , beneath , in letters scarcely less impressive : YANCEY CRAVAT , PROP . AND EDITOR . ATTORNEY AT LAW . NOTARY . The placing of this sign took the better part of a day , during which time all other work was suspended . While the operation was in progress Yancey crossed the road fifty times , ostensibly to direct matters from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bask in the dazzling effect of the bold fat black letters . As always in I05the course of such proceedings on the part of the laboringmale there was much hoarse shouting , gesticulation , and general rumpus . To Sabra , coming to the door from time to time , dish towel or ladle in hand , the clamor seemed out of all proportion to the results achieved . She thought ( privately ) that two women could have finished the job in half the time with one tenth the fuss . She still was far too feminine , tactful , and in love with her husband to say so . Cim enjoyed the whole thing enormously , as did his black satellite , bodyguard , and playmate , Isaiah . They capered , shouted , whooped , and added much to the din . Yancey , from across the road ? " Lift her up a little higher that end ! " . " What say ? " from the perspiring Jesse Rickey , his assistant . " That en  --  p ! NO ! UP ! I said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chris ' sakes , right or left ? " " Right ! RIGHT ! God Almighty , man , do n't you know your right from your left ? " " Easy now . E-e-e-esy ! Over now . Over ! There ! That '  --   --  e  --  ow head her a little this way . . . . " " How 's that ? " " Oh , my land 's sakes alive ! " thought Sabra , going back to her orderly kitchen . " Men make such a lot of work of nothing . " It was her first admission that the male of the species might be fallible . A product of Southern training , even though a daily witness , during her girlhood , to the dominance of her matriarchal mother over her weak and war-shattered father , she had been bred to the traditionthat the male was always right , always to beIo6deferred to . Yancey , still her passionate lover , had alwaystreated her , tenderly , as a charming little fool , and this role she had meekl  --  ven gratefull  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . These last three weeks had shown her that the male was often mistaken , as a sex , and that Yancey was almost always wrong as an individual . But these frightening discoveries she would not yet admit even to herself . Also that he was enthralled by the dramatics of any plan he might conceive , but that he often was too impatient of its mechanics to carry it through to completion . " Yancey , this case of type 's badly pied . " Jesse Rickey , journeyman printer and periodic drunkard , was ' responsible for this misfortune , having dropped a case , face down , in the dust of the road while assisting Yancey in the moving . " It 'll have to be sorted before you can get out a paper . " " Oh , Rickey 'll tend to that . I 've got a lot of importantwork to do . Editorials to write , news to get , lot of real estate transfer  --  nd I 'm going to find out who killed Pegler and print it in the first issue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , please do n't . What does . it matter ! He 's dead . Maybe he did shoot himself . And besides , you 've got Cim and me to think of . You ca n't let anything happen to you . " " Let that Yountis gang get away with a thing like that and anything is likely to happen to me ; the same thing that happened to him . No , sir ! I 'll show them , first crack , that the Oklahoma Wigwam prints all the news , all the time , knowing no law but the Law of God and the government of these United States ! Say , that 's a107pretty good slogan . Top of the page , just above the editorialcolumn . " In the end it was she who sorted the case of pied type . The five years of Yancey 's newspaper ownership in Wichita had familiarized her , almost unconsciously , with many of the mechanical aspects of a newspaper printing shop . She even liked the smell of printer 's ink , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand press . She found that the brass and copper thin spaces , used for setting up ads , had no proper container , and at a loss to find one she hit upon the idea of using a muffin tin until a proper receptacle could be found . It never was found , and the muffin tin still served after a quarter of a century had gone by . She was , by that time , sentimentalabout it , and superstitious . The hand press was finally set up , and the little job press , and the case rack containing the type . The rollers were in place , and their little stock of paper . Curiously enough , though neither Yancey nor Sabra was conscious of it , it was she who had directed most of this manual work and who had indeed actually performed much of it , with Isaiah and Jesse Rickey to help her . Yancey was off and up the street every ten minutes . Returning , he would lose himself in the placing of his law library , his books of reference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not enough shelf room in the house proper . He had brought along boxes of books stowed away in the covered wagons . If the combined book wealth contained in all the houses , offices , and shops of the entire Oklahoma country so newly settled could have been gathered in one spot it probably would have been found to number less than this preposterousro8library of the paradoxical Yancey Cravat . Glib and showy though he was with his book knowledge Yancey still had in these volumes of his the absorption of the true book lover . He gave more attention to the carpenterwho put up these crude bookshelves than he had bestowed upon the actual coupling of the two cabins when first they had moved in . The books he insisted on placing himself , picking them up , one by one , and losinghimself now in this page , now in that , so that at the end of the long hot afternoon he had accomplished nothing . Blackstone and Kent ( ineffectual enough in this lawless land ) were shocked to find themselves hobnobbingside by side with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosily between the shameless tale of the sprightly Wife of Bath and Yancey 's new and joyously discovered copy of Fitzgerald'sOmar Khayyam . Lost to all else he would call happily in to Sabra as she bent over the case rack , her cheek streaked with ink , her fingers stained , her head close to Jesse Rickey 's bleary-eyed one as she sorted type or filled the muffin tin with the metal thin spaces : " Sabe ! Oh , Sab  --  isten to this . " He would clear his throat . " Son of Nestor , delight of my heart , mark the flashing of bronze through the echoing halls , and the flashing of gold and of amber and of silver and of ivory . Such like , methinks , is the court of Olympian Zeus within , for the world of things that are here ; wonder comes over me as I look thereon . ' ... God , Sabra , it 's as fine as the Old Testament . Finer ! " " The world of things that are here , ' echoed Sabra , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perhaps if you 'd pay more attention to those , and less to your 109 nonsense in books about gold and silver and ivory , we might get settled . " But he was ready with a honeyed reply culled from the same book so dear to his heart and his grandiloquent tongue . " Be not wroth with me hereat , goddess and queen . ' " The goddess and queen pushed her hair back from her forehead with a sooty hand , leaving still another smudge of printer 's ink upon that worried surface . Jesse Rickey , the printer ( known , naturally , to his familiars as " Gin " Rickey , owing to his periods of intemperance ) and black Isaiah were , next to Sabra , most responsible for the astounding fact that the Cravat familyfinally was settled in house and office . The front door , which was the office entrance , faced the wide wallow of the main street . The back and the side doors of the dwelling looked out on a stretch of Oklahoma red clay , littered with the empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ especially one whose drought is relieved by the thirst-quenching coolness of tinned tomatoes and peaches . Perhaps the canned tomato , as much as anything , made possible the settling of the vast West and Southwest . In the midst of this clay and refuse , in a sort of shed-kennel , lived little Isaiah ; rather , he slept there , like a faithful dog , for all day long he was about the house and the printing office , tireless , willing , invaluable . He belonged to Sabra , body and soul , as completely as though the Civil War had never been . A little servant of twelve , born to labor , he became as dear to Sabra , as accustomed , as one of her own children , despite her Southern training and his black skin . He dried the dishes , a towel tied round hisI lo neck ; he laid the table ; he was playmate and nursemaid for Cim ; he ran errands , a swift and splay-footed Mercury ; he was a born reporter , and , in the course of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or that brought into Sabra 's kitchen more items of news and gossip ( which were later transferred to the newspaperoffice ) than a whole staff of trained newspaper men could have done . He was so little , so black , so lithe , so harmless looking , that his presence was , more often than not , completely overlooked . The saloon loungers , cowboys , rangers , and homesteaders in and about the town alternately spoiled and plagued him . One minute they were throwing him dimes in the dust for his rendition of his favorite song : King Jesus come a-ridin ' on a milk-white steed , Wid a rainbow on his shoulder . The next moment they were making his splay-feet dance frenziedly as the bullets from their six-shooters plopped playfully all about him and his kinky hair seemed to grow straight and dank with terror . Sabra , in time , taught him to read , write , and figure . He was quick to learn , industrious , lovable . He thought he actually belonged to her . Cim was beginning to learn the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Isaiah , too , would bring his little stool out of its corner . Perched on it like an intelligent monkey he mastered the curlycuesin their proper sequence . He cleared the unsightly back yard of its litter of tin cans and refuse.Together he and Sabra even tried to plant a little garden in this barren sanguine clay . More than anything else , Sabra missed the trees and flowers . In the whole town ofIIIA. almost ten thousand inhabitants there were two trees : . stunted jack oaks . Sometimes she dreamed of lilies of the valle  --  he translucent , almost liquid green of their stems and leaves , the perfumed purity of theirwhite bells . All this , however , came later . These first few days were filled to overflowing with the labor of making the house habitable and the office and plant fit for Yancey 's professional pursuits . Already his talents as a silvertonguewere being sought in defense of murderers , horse thieves , land grabbers , and more civil offenders in all the surrounding towns and counties . It was known that the average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his plea it was as though he were painting the emotions that succeeded each other across the faces of the twelve ( or less , depending on the number available in the community ) good men ( or good enough ) and true . A tremolo ton  --  heir eyes began to moisten , their mouth muscles to sag with sympathy ; a wave of the hand , a lilt of the golden voic  --  hey guffawed with mirth . Even a horse thief , that blackest of criminals in this country , was said to have a bare chance for his life if Yancey Cravat could be induced to plead for hi  --  nd provided always , of course , that the posse had not dealt with the offender first . Yancey , from the time he rose in the morning until he went to bed late at night , was always a little overstimulatedby the whisky he drank . This , together with a natural fearlessness , an enormous vitality , and a devouringinterest in everybody and everything in this fantastic Oklahoma country , gained him friends and enemies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their arrival in Osage , his II2one interest seemed to be the tracing of the Pegler murde  --  or he scoffed at the idea that his predecessor 's death was due to any other cause . He asked his question everywhere , even in the most foolhardy circumstances , and watched the effect of his question . Pegler had been a Denver newspaper man ; known , respected , decent . Yancey had sworn to bring his murderers to justice . Sabra argued with him , almost hysterically , but in vain . " You did n't do anything about helping them catch the Kid , out there on the prairie , when they were looking for him , and you knew where he wa  --  r just abou  --  nd he had killed a man , too , and robbed a bank , and I do n't know what all . " " That was different . The Kid 's different , " Yancey answered , unreasonably and infuriatingly . " Different ! How different ? What 's this Pegler to you ! They 'll kill you , to  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do ? ? Ci  --  i  --  nd I here , alone ? Yancey , darlin  --  love you s  --  f anything should happen to you " She waxed incoherent . " Listen , honey . Hush your crying and listen . Try to understand . The Kid 's a terror . He 's a bad one . But it is n't his fault . The government at Washington made him an outlaw . " " Why , Yancey Cravat , what are you talking about ? Do n't you ever say a thing like that before Cim . " " The Kid 's father rode the range before there were fences or railroads in Kansas , and when this part of the country was running wild with longhorn cattle that had descended straight from the animals that the Spaniards had brought over four centuries ago . The railroads be-I131gan coming in . The settlers came with it , from the Gulf Coast , up across Texas , through the Indian Territory to the end of steel at Abilene , Kansas . The Kid was brought up to all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hunters , and cowboy  --  hat 's all he knew . Into Dodge City , with perhaps nine months ' pay jingling in his pocket . I 'll bet neither the Kid nor his father before him ever saw a nickel or a dime . They would n't have bothered with such chicken feed . Silver dollars were the smallest coin they knew . They worked for it , too . I 've seen seventy-five thousand cattle at a time waiting shipment to the East , with lads like the Kid in charge . The Kid 's grandfather was a buffalo hunter . The range was the only life they wanted . Along comes the government . What happens ? " " What ? " breathed Sabra , as always enthralled by one of Yancey 's arguments , forgetting quite that she must oppose this very plea . " They take the range away from the cattle men and cowboy  --  he free range that never belonged to them really , but that they had come to think of as theirs through right of use . Squatters come in , Sooners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rush of the Opening . The range is cut up into town sites , and the town into lots , before their very eyes . Why , it must have sickened the  --  illed them almos  --  o see it . " " But that 's progress , Yancey . The country 's got to be settled . " " This was different . There 's never been anything like this . Settling a great sectiQn of a country always has been a matter of year  --  ecade  --  enturies , even . But here they swept over it in a day . You know that as well " 41as I do . Wilderness one day ; town sites the next . And the cowboys and rangers having no more chance than chips in a flood . Ca n't you see it ? Shanties where the horizon used to be ; grocery stores on the old buffalo trails . They went plumb locoed , I tell you . They could n't fight progress , but they could get revenge on the people who had taken their world away from them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're taking the part of criminals , of murderers , of bad men ! I 'm ashamed of you ! I 'm afraid of you ! You 're as bad as they are . " " Now , now , Sabra . No dramatics . Leave that for me . I 'm better at it . The Kid 's bad , yes . They do n't come worse than he . And they 'll get him , eventually . But he never kills unless he has to . When he robs a bank or holds up a train it 's in broad daylight , by God , with a hundred guns against him . He runs a risk . He does n't shoot in the dark . The other fellow always has a chance . It 's three or four , usually , against fifty . He was brought up a reckless , lawless , unschooled youngster . He 's a killer now , and he 'll die by the gun , with his boots on . But the man who fathered him need n't be ashamed of him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For one dreadful sickening second something closed with iron fingers around Sabra Cravat 's heart and squeezed it , and it ceased to beat . White faced , her dark eyes searched her husband 's face . Wichita whispers . Kansas slander . But that face was all exaltation , like the face of an evangelist , and as pure . His eyes were glowing . The iron fingers relaxed . " But Pegler . The men who killed Pegler . Why are they so much worseH51 " Skunks . Dirty jackals hired by white-livered poli-ticians . " " But why ? Why ? " " Because Pegler had the same idea I hav  --  hat here 's a chance to start clean , right from scratch . Live and let live . Clean politics instead of the skulduggery all around ; a new way of living and of thinking , because we 've had a chance to see how rotten and narrow and bigoted the other way has been . Here everything 's fresh . It 's all to do , and we can do it . There 's never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can make a model empire out of this Oklahoma country , with all the mistakes of the other pioneers to profit by . New England , and California , and the settlers of the Middle Wes  --  t got away from them , and they fell into the rut . Ugly politics , ugly towns , ugly buildings , ugly minds . " He was off again . Sabra , all impatience , stopped him . " But Pegler . What 's that got to do with Pegler ? " She hated the name . She hated the dead man who was stalking their new life and threatening to destroy it . " I saw that one copy of his paper . He called it the New Da  --  oor devil . And in it he named names , and he outlined a policy and a belief something lik  --  ellalongthe lines I 've tried to explain to you . He accused the government of robbing the Indians .

They wo n't work . You 've said so yourself . They just squat there , rotting . " " I 've tried to explain to you , " Yancey began , gently . " White men ca n't do those things to a helpless " And so they killed him ! " Sabra cried , irrelevantly . " And they 'll kill you , too . Oh , Yance  --  leas  --  lease ? I do n't want to be a pioneer woman . I thought I did , but I do n't . I ca n't make things different . I liked them as they were . Comfortable and safe . Let them alone .

And when I find the man who killed Pegler I 'll face him with it , and I 'll publish his name , and if he 's alive by then I 'll bring him to justice and I 'll see him strung up on a tree . If I do n't it 'll be because I 'm not alive myself . " " Oh , God ! " whimpered Sabra , and sank , a limp bundle of misery , into his arms . But those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He put her from him , gently , but with iron firmness , and walked out of the house , through the newspaper office , down the broad and sinister red road. 117 A ANCEY put his question wherever he came upon a little group of three or four lounging on saloon or store porch or street corner . " How did Pegler come to die ? " The effect of the question always was the same . One minute they were standing sociably , gossiping , rolling cigarettes ; citizenry at ease in their shirt sleeves . Yancey would stroll up with his light , graceful step , his white sombrero with the two bullet holes in its crown , his Prince Albert , his fine high-heeled boots . He would ask his question . As though by magic the group dispersed , faded , vanished . He visited Coroner Hefner , of Hefner 's Furniture Store and Undertaking Parlor . That gentleman was seated , idle for the moment , in his combination office and laboratory . " Listen , Louie . How did Pegler come to die @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ less roseate . His pale blue pop-eyes stared at Yancey in dismay . " Are you going around town askin ' that there question , or just me ? " " O  --  round . " Hefner leaned forward . He looked about him furtively . He lowered his voice . " Yancey , you and your missus , you bought your furniture and so on here in my place , and what 's more , you paid cash for it . I want you as a customer , see , but not in the other branch of my business . Do n't go round askin ' that there question . " " Think I 'd better not , h 'm ? " " I know you better not . " " Why not ? " The versatile Hefner made a little gesture of despair , rose , vanished by way of his own back door , and did not return . Yancey strolled out into the glaring sunshine of Pawhuska Avenue . Indians , Mexicans , cowboys , solid citizens lounged in whatever of shade could be found in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood Pete Pitchlyn talking to the Spaniard , Estevan Miro . They were the gossips of the town , these two . This Yancey knew . News not only of the town , but of the Territory ? not alone of the Territory but of the whole brilliant burning Southwest , from Texas through New Mexico into Arizona , sieved through this pair . Miro not only knew ; he sold his knowledge . The Spaniard made a gay splash of color in the drab prairie street . He wore a sash of purple wound round his middle in place of a belt and his neckerchief was of scarlet . His face was tiny , like the face of a child , and pointed ; his hair was thick , blue-black , and lay in definite strands , coarse and glossy , like fine wire . His two upper incisor teeth were separated by , perhaps , the width of an eighth of an inch . He was very quiet , and his movements appeared slow because of their feline grace . Eternally he rolled cigarettes in 119 lCthe cowboy fashion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ magically between The thumb and two fingers of his right hand . The smoke of these he inhaled , consuming a cigarette in three voracious pulls . The street corner on which he lounged was ringed with limp butts . Pete Pitchlyn , famous Indian scout of a bygone day , has grown pot-bellied and flabby , now that the Indians were rotting on their reservations and there was no more work for him to do . He was a vast fellow , his height of six feet three now balanced by his bulk . His wife , a full-blood Cherokee squaw , squatted on the ground in the shade of a near-by frame shack about ten feet away , as befits a wife whose husband is conversing with another male . On the ground all around her , like a litter of puppies tumbling about a bitch , were their halfbreedchildren . Late in his hazardous career as a scout on the plains Pitchlyn had been shot in the left heel by a poisoned Indian arrow . It was thought he would surely die . This failing , it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combination of unlimited whisky , a constitution made up of chilled steel , and a determinationthat those varmints should never kill him , somehowcaused him not only to live but to keep the poisonravagedleg clinging to his carcass . Stubbornly he had refused to have it amputated , and by a miracle it had failed to send its poison through the rest of that iron frame . But the leg had withered and shrunk until now it was fully twelve inches shorter than the sound limb . He refused to use crutches or the clumsy mechanical devices of the day , and got about with astonishing speed and agility . When he stood on the sound leg heItowas , with his magnificent breadth of shoulders , a giant of six feet three . But occasionally the sound leg tired , and he would rest it by slumping for a moment on the other . He then became a runt five feet high . The story was told of him that when he first came to Osage in the rush of the Run he , with hundreds of others , sought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten  --  ad opened its bar and stood ready for business as the earliest homesteader drew his red-eyed sweating horse up before the first town site to which claim was laid in the settlement of Osage ( at that tim  --  ully a month befor  --  piece of prairie as bare and flat as the palm of your hand ) . The crowd around the rough pine slab of the hastily improvised bar was parched , wild eyed , clamorous . The bartenders , hardenedimportations though they were , were soon ready to drop with fatigue . Even in this milling mob the toweringfigure of Pete Pitchlyn was one to command attention . Above the clamor he ordered his drin  --  hree fingers of whisky . It was a long time coming . He had had a hard day . He leaned one elbow on the bar , while shouts emerged as croaks from parched throats , and glasses and bottles whirled all about him . Dead tired , he shifted his weight from the sound right leg to the witheredleft , and conversed half-heartedly with the thirsty ones on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whisky , shoved it toward him , saw in his place only a wearily pensive little man whose head barely showed above the bar , and , outraged , his patiencetried beyond endurance , yelled : " Hey , you runt ! Get out of there ! Where 's the son of a bitch who ordered this whisky ? " I2ItLike a python Pete Pitchlyn uncoiled to his full height and glared down on the bewildered bartender . Crowded though it was , the drinks were on the house . These two specimens of the Southwest it was that Yancey now approached , his step a saunter , his manner carefree , even bland . Almost imperceptibly the two seemed to stiffen , as though bracing themselves for action . In the old scout it evidenced itself in his sudden emergence from lounging cripple to statuesque giant . In the Spaniard you sensed , rather than saw , only a curiously rippling motion of the muscles beneath the smooth tawny skin , like a snake that glides before it really moves to go . " Howdy , Pete ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Miro eyed him innocently . " Que tal ? " " Bien . Y to ? " They stood , the three , wary , silent . Yancey balanced gayly from shining boot toe to high heel and back again . The Cherokee woman kept her sloe eyes on her man , as though , having received one signal , she were holding herself in readiness for another . Yancey put the eternal question of the inquiring reporter . " Well , boys , what do you know ? " The two were braced for a query less airy . Their faces relaxed in an expression resembling disappointment . It was as when gunfire fails to explode . The Spaniard shrugged his shoulders , a protean gesture intended on this occasion to convey to the beholder the utter innocenceand uneventfulness of the daily existence led by 122Estevan Miro . Pete Pitchlyn 's eyes , in that ravaged face , were coals in an ash heap . It was not for him to be seen talking on the street corner with the man who was asking a fatal questio  --  atal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be foolhardy enough to answer it . He knew Yancey , admired him , wished him well . Yet there was little he dared say now before the reptilian Miro . Yancey continued , conversationally : " I understand there 's an element rarin ' around town bragging that they 're going to make Osage the terror of the Southwest , like Abilene and Dodge City in the old days ; and the Cimarron . " The jaws of Pete Pitchlyn worked rhythmically on the form of nicotine to which he was addicted . Estevan Miro inhaled a deep draught of his brand of poison and sent forth its wraith , a pale gray jet , through his nostrils . Thus each maintained an air of nonchalance to hide his nervousness . " I 'm interviewingcitizens of note , " continued Yancey , blandly , " on whether they think this town ought to be run on that principle or on a Socratic one that the more modern element has in mind . " He lifted his great head and turned his rare gaze full on the little Spaniard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black eyes , and the darker ones shifted . " Are you at all familiar with the works of Socrates ? Socrates . . . whom well inspir 'd the oracle pronounced wisest of men ' ? " Again Estevan Miro shrugged . This time the gesture was exquisitely complicated in its meaning , even for a low-class Spaniard . Slight embarrassment was in it , some bewilderment , and a grai  --  he merest flec  --  f something as nearly approaching contempt as was possible in him for a man whom he feared. 123 " Yancey , " said Pete Pitchlyn , deliberately , " stick to your lawy'in ' . " " Why ? " " Anybody 's got the gift of gab like you have is wastin ' their time doin ' anything else . " " Oh , I would n't say that , " Yancey replied , all modesty . " Running a newspaper keeps me in touch with folks . I like it . Besides , the law is n't very remunerativein these parts . Running a newspaper 's my way of earning a living @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an afterthought , " there have been times when running a newspaper has saved the editor the trouble of ever again having to earn a living . " The faces of the two were blank as a sponged slate . Suddenly ? " Come on , boys . Who killed Pegler ? " Pete Pitchlyn , his Cherokee squaw , and the litter of babies dispersed . It was magic . They faded , vanished . It was as though the woman had tossed her young into a pouch , like a kangaroo . As for the cripple , he might have been a centipede . Yancey and the Spaniard were left alone on the sunny street corner . The face of Miro now became strangely pinched . The eyes were inky slits . He was summoning all his little bravado , pulling it out of his inmost depths . " I know something . I have that to tell you , " he said in Spanish , his lips barely moving . Yancey replied in the same tongue , " Out with it . " The Spaniard did not speak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ already he must have been well paid by someone to show such temerity when his very vitals were gripped-with fear . " You know something , h 'm ? Well , Miro , mas vale saber que haber . " With1241which bit of philosophy he showed Miro what a Westernercan do in the way of a shrug ; and sauntered off . Miro leaped after him in one noiseless bound , like a cat . He seemed now to be more afraid of not revealing that which he had been paid to say than of saying it . He spoke rapidly , in Spanish . His hard r sounds drummedlike hail on a tin roof . " I say only that which was told to me . The words are not mine . They say , Are you a friend of Yancey Cravat ? ' I say , Yes . ' They say then , Tell your friend Yancey Cravat that wisdom is better than wealth . If he does not keep his damn mouth shut he will die . ' The words are not mine . " " Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then with one fine white hand he reached out swiftly and gave Miro 's scarlet neckerchief a quick strong jerk and twist . The gesture was at once an insult and a threat . " Tell them " Suddenly Yancey stopped . He opened his mouth , and there issued from it a sound so dreadful , so unearthly as to freeze the blood of any within hearing . It was a sound between the gobble of an angry turkey cock and the howl of a coyote . Throughout the Southwest it was known that this terriblesound , famed as the gobble , was Cherokee in origin and a death cry among the Territory Indians . It was known , too , that when an Indian gobbled it meant sudden destruction to any or all in his path . The Spaniard 's face went a curious dough gray . With a whimper he ran , a streak of purple and scarlet and brown , round the corner of the nearest shack , and vanished . Unfortunately , Yancey could not resist the temptationof dilating to Sabra on this dramatic triumph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elision , as the Katy The newly acquired treasure was a picture , done in oils , of a robust and very pink lady of full habit who , apparently having expended all her energy upon the arrangement of her elaborate and highly modern coiffure , was temporarily unable to proceed further with her toilette until fortified by refreshment and repose . To this end she had flung herself in a complete state of nature ( barring the hairpins ) down on a convenient couch where she lolled at ease , her lips parted to receive a pair of ripe red cherries which she held dangling betweenthumb and forefinger of a hand whose little finger was elegantly crooked . Her eyes were not on the cherries but on the beholder , of whom she was , plainly , all unaware . . As a tent naturally boasts no walls , it was impossible properly to hang this objet d'art , and it was being suspended by guy ropes from the tent top so that it dangled just in front of the bar , as it properly should , flanked by mirrors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days of Denver , San Francisco , White Oaks , and Dodge City . In these precocious cities his artistic tastes had been developed . He knew that the eye , as well as the gullet , must have refreshment in hours of ease . A little plump man , Grat , with a round and smiling countenance , strangely unlined . He looked like an old baby . He now , at Yancey 's entrance , called his attention to the newly acquired treasure , expressing at the same time his admiration for it . " Ai n't she , " he demanded , " a lalapaloosa ! " Yancey surveyed the bright pink lady . He had come1301to ask a favor of Grat , but he would not sell his artistic soul for this mess of pottage . " It 's a calumny , " he announced , with some vehemence , " on nature 's fairest achievement . " The word was not contained in Mr. Gotch 's vocabulary . He mistook Yancey 's warmth of tone for enthusiasm . " That 's right , " he agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the boys only this morning when she come . " Yancey ordered his drink and invited Gotch to have one with him . Arkansas Grat was not one of those abstemious characters frequently found in fiction who , being dispensers of alcoholic refreshment , never sample their own wares . Over the whisky Yancey put his case . " Listen , Grat . The women folks have got it into their heads that there ought to be a church service Sunday , now that Osage is over a month old , with ten thousand inhabitants , and probably the metropolis of the great Southwest in another ten years . They want the thing done right . I 'm chosen to conduct the meeting . There 's no building in town big enough to hold the crowd . What I want to know is , can we have the loan of your tent here for about an hour Sunday morning for the purpose of divine worship ? " Arkansas Grat set down his glass , made a sweeping gesture with his right hand that included faro tables , lolling cherry eater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tent contained . " Divine worship ! Why , hell , yes , Yancey , " he replied , graciously . They went to work early Sunday . So as not to mar the numbers they covered the faro and roulette tables1311with twenty-two-foot boards . Such of the prospective congregation as came early would use these for seats . There were , too , a few rude benches on which the players usually sat . The remainder must stand . The meeting was to be from eleven to twelve . As early as nine o'clock they began to arrive . They seemed to spring out of the earth . The horizon spewed up little hurrying figures , black against the brilliant Oklahoma sky . They came from lonely cabins , dugouts , tents . Ox carts , wagons , buggies , horsemen , mule teams . They were starving for company . It was n't religion they sought ; it was the stimulation that comes of meeting their kind in the mass . They brought picnic baskets and boxes , prepared for a holiday . The cowboys were gorgeous . They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , their gayest neckerchiefs , their most ornate high-heeled boots . They rode up and down before the big tent , their horses curveting and stepping high . " Whoa there ! Do n't crowd the cattle ! . . . You figgerin ' on gettin ' saved , Quince ? . . . Yessir , I 'm here for the circus and I 'm stvin ' for the concert and grand olio besides ... . Say , you 're too late , son . Good whisky and bad women has ruined you . " The town seemed alive with blanketed Indians . They squatted in the shade of the wooden shacks . They walked in from their near-by reservations , or rode their mangy horses , or brought in their entire families ? squaw , papoose , two or three children of assorted sizes , dogs . The family rarely was a large one . Sabra had once remarked this . " They do n't have big families , do they ? Two or three children . You 'd think savages like tha  --  mean " 132Yancey explained . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost . I do n't know whether it 's the food they ea  --  heir die  --  r the vigorous outdoor life they 've lived for centuries , or whether they 're a naturallysterile race . Funny . No hair on their face  --  o beards . Did you ever see an Indian festival dance ? " " Oh , no ! I 've heard they " They work themselves up , you know , at those dances . Insidious music , mutilations , hysteri  --  ll kinds of orgies to get themselves up to pitch . " Sabra had shuddered with disgust . This Sunday morning they flocked in by the dozens , with their sorry nags and their scabrous dogs . The men were decked in all their beads and chains with metal plaques . They camped outside the town , at the end o ; the street . Sabra , seeing them , told herself sternly that she must remember to have a Christian spirit , and they were all God 's children ; that these red men had been converted . She did n't believe a word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before Joshua , " Mother Bridget had said . Rangers , storekeepers , settlers . Lean squatters with their bony wives and their bare-legged , rickety children , as untamed as little wolves . Sabra superintended the toilettes of her men folk from Yancey to Isaiah . She herself had stayed up the night before to iron ? his finest shirt . Isaiah had polished his boots until they glittered . Sabra sprinkled a drop of her own cherished cologne on his handkerchief . It was as though they were making ready a bridegroom . He chided her , laughing , " My good woman , do you realize that this is no way to titivate for the work of133delivering the Word of God ? Sackcloth and ashes is , I believe , the prescribed costume . " He poured and drank down three fingers of whisky , the third since breakfast . Cim cavorted excitedly in his best suit , with the bright plaid silk tie and the buttoned shoes , tasseled at the top . The boy , Sabra thought as she dressed him , grew more and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father 's driving force , his ebullience . But he was high spirited enough now , so that she had difficulty in dressing him . " I 'm going to church ! " he shouted , his voice shrill . " Hi , Isaiah ! Blessed be the name of the Lawd Anien hall'ujah glory be oh my fren 's come and be save hell fire and brimstone " Cimarron Cravat , stop that this minute or you 'll have to stay home . " Evidently he and Isaiah , full of the Sunday meeting , had been playing church on Saturday afternoon . This was the result of their rehearsal . Yancey 's sure dramatic instinct bade him delay until he could make an effective entrance . A dozen times Sabra called to him , as he sat in the front office busy with paper and pencil . This was , she decided , his sole preparation for the sermon he would be bound to deliver within the next hour . Later she found in the pocket of his sweeping Prince Albert the piece of paper on which he had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whorls , crisscrosses , parallel lines and skulls with which the hand unconsciously gives relief to the troubled or restless mind . One word he had written on it , and then disguised it with meaningless mark  --  ut not quite . Sabra , studying the paper after the events of the morning , made out the word " Yountis. " 134At last he was ready . As they stepped into the road they saw that stragglers were still hurrying toward the tent . Sabra had put on , not her second-best black grosgrain , but her best , and the hat with the plumes , none of which splendor she had worn since that eventful first day . She and Yancey stepped sedately down the street , with Cim 's warm wriggling fingers in her own clasp . Sabra was a slimly elegant little figure in her modish black ; Yancey , as always , a dashing one ; Cim 's clothes were identical with those being worn , perhaps , by a million little boys all over the United States , now on their unwilling way to church . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back yard , had announced that his churchgoing toilette was not quite completed , urged them to proceed without him , and promised to catch up with them before they should have gone a hundred feet . They went on their way . It occurred neither to Sabra nor to Yancey that there was anything bizarre or even unusual in their thus proceeding , three well-dressed and reasonably conventional figures , toward a gambling tent and saloon which , packed to suffocation with the worst and the best that a frontier town has to offer , was for one short hour to become a House of God . " Are you nervous , Yancey dear ? " " No , sugar . Though I will say I 'd fifty times rather plead with a jury of Texas Panhandle cattlemen for the life of a professional horse thief than stand up to preach before this gang of He broke off abruptly . " What 's everybody laughing at and pointing to ? " Certainly passers-by were acting strangely . Instinctively Sabra and Yancey turned to look behind them . Down the 135 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He was strutting in an absurd and yet unmistakably recognizable imitation of Yancey 's stride and swing . Around his waist was wound a red calico sash , and over that hung a holstered leather belt so large for his small waist that it hung to his knees and bumped against them at every step . Protruding from the holsters one saw the ugly heads of what seemed at first glance to be two sixshooters , but which turned out , on investigation by the infuriated Mrs. Cravat , to be the household monkey wrench and a bar of ink-soaked iron which went to make up one of the printing shop metal forms . On his head was a battere  --  n unspeakabl  --  ombrero which he must have salvaged from the back-yard debris . But this was not , after all , the high point of his sartorial triumph . He had found somewhere a pair of Yancey 's discarded boots . They were high heeled , slim , star trimmed . Even in their final degradation they still had something of the elegance of cut and material that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ splendor Isaiah had thrust , as far as possible , his own great bare splay feet . The high heels toppled . The arched insteps split under the pressure . Isaiah teetered , wobbled , walked11now on his ankles as the treacherous heel betrayed him ; now on his toes . Yet he managed , by the very power of his dramatic gift , to give to the appreciative onlooker a complete picture of Yancey Cravat in ludicrou  --  n grotesque miniature . He advanced toward them , in spite of his pedestrian handicaps , with an appalling imitation of Yancey 's stride . Sabra 's face went curiously sallow , so that she was , suddenly , Felice Venable , enraged . Yancey gave a136 1great roar of laughter , and at that Sabra 's blazing eyes turned from the ludicrous figure of the black boy to her husband . She was literally panting with fury . Her idol , her god , was being mocked . " Yo  --  augh ! . . . Stop . . . . " She went in a kind of swoop of rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's hand was still tightly clutched by her own she had quite forgotten that he was there so that , as she flew toward the small mimic , Cim was yanked along as a cyclone carries small objects in its trail by the very force of its own velocity . She reached him . The black face , all eyes now ( and those all whites ) , looked up at her , startled , terrorized . She raised her hand in its neat black kid glove to cuff him smartly . But Yancey was too quick for her . Swiftly as she had swooped upon Isaiah , Yancey 's leap had been quicker . He caught her hand halfway in its descent . His fingers closed round her wrist in an iron grip . " Let me go ! " For that instant she hated him . " If you touch him I swear before God I 'll not set foot inside the tent . Look at him ! " The black face gazed up at him . In it was worship , utter devotion . Yancey , himself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in his struttings and swaggerings , there had been only that sincerest of flattery , imitation of that which was adored . The eyes were those of a dog , faithful , hurt , bewildered . Yancey released Sabra 's wrist . He turned his brilliant winning smile on Isaiah . He put out his hand , removed the mangy sombrero from the child 's head , and let his fine white hand rest a moment on the woolly poll. 1371Isaiah began to blubber , his fright giving way to injury . " Ah did n't go fo ' to fret nobody . You-all was dress up fine fo ' ch'ch meetin ' so I crave to dress myself up Sunday style " That 's right , Isaiah . You look finer than any of us . Now listen to me . Do you want a real suit of Sunday clothes ? " The white teeth now vied with the rolling eyes . " Sunday suit fo ' me to wear ! Fo ' true ! " " Listen close , Isaiah . I want you to do something for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go to the church meeting . " Then , as the black boy 's expressive face , all smiles the instant before , became suddenly doleful : " Isaiah , listen hard . This is something important . Everybody in town 's at the church meeting . Jesse Rickey 's drunk . The house and the newspaper office are left alone . There are people in town who 'd sooner set fire to the newspaper plant and the house than see the paper come out on Thursday . I want you to go back to the house and into the kitchen , where you can see the back yard and the side entrance , too . Patrol duty , that 's what I 'm putting you on . " " Yes , suh , Mr. Yancey ! " agreed Isaiah . " Patrol . " His dejected frame now underwent a transformation as it stiffened to fit the new martial role . " Now listen close . If anybody comes up to the house ? they wo n't come the front way , but at the back , probably , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He took from beneath the Prince Albert a gun which , well on the left , under the coat , was not visible as were the two six-shooters that he always carried at his belt . It was a six-shooter of the kind known as the single138action . The trigger was dead . It had been put out of commission . The do  --  hat part of the mechanism by which the hammer was held cocked and which was releasedat the pulling of the trigge  --  ad been filed off . It was the deadliest of Southwestern weapons , a sixshooterwhose hammer , when pulled back by the thumb , would fall again as soon as released . No need for Isaiah 's small forefinger to wrestle with the trigger . " Oh , Yancey ! " breathed Sabra , in horror . She made as though to put Cim behind he  --  o shield him with her best black grosgrain silk from sight of this latest horror of pioneer existence . " Yancey ! He 's a child ! " Now it was she who was protecting the black boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I told you last week , " he went on , equably . " When we were shooting at the tin can on the fence post in the yard . Do it just as you did it then ? draw , aim , and shoot with the one motion . " " Yes , suh , Mr. Yancey ! I kill ' em daid . " " You 'll have a brand-new suit of Sunday clothes next week , remember , and boots to go with it . Now , scoot ! " Isaiah turned on the crazy high-heeled boots . " Take them off ! " screamed Sabra . " You 'll kill yourself . The gun . You 'll stumble ! " But he flashed a brilliant , a glorified smile at her over his shoulder and was off , a ludicrous black Don Quixote miraculously keeping his balance ; the boots slapping the deep dust of the road now this way , now that . All Sabra 's pleasurable anticipation in the church meeting had fled . " How could you give a gun to a child139 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here , next . Alone in the house , with a gun . " " It is n't loaded . Come on , honey . We 're late . " For the first time in their married life she doubted his word absolutely . He strode along toward the tent . She hurried at his side . Cim trotted to keep up with her , his hand in hers . " What did you mean when you said there were people who would set fire to the house ? I never heard of such ... Did you really mean that someone . . . or was it an excuse to send Isaiah back because of the way he looked ? " " That was it . " For the second time she doubted him . " I do n't believe you . There 's something going o  --  omething you have n't told me . Yancey , tell me . " " I have n't time now . Do n't be foolish . I just do n't like the complexion o  --  just thought that maybe this meeting was the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a closer communion with God . Just occurred to me . I do n't know why . Good joke on me , if it 's true . " " I 'm not going to the meeting . I 'm going back to the house . " She was desperate . Her house was burning up , Isaiah was being murdered . Her linen , the silver in the DeGrasse pattern , the cake dish , the green nun 's veiling . " You 're coming with me . " He rarely used this tone toward her . " Yancey ! Yancey , I'm-afraid to have you stand up there , before all those people . I 'm afraid . Let 's go back . Tell them you 're sick . Tell them I 'm sick . Tell them ? " 14oThey had reached the tent . The flap was open . A roar of talk came to them from within . The entrance was packed with lean figures smoking and spitting . " Hi , Yancey ! How 's the preacher ? Where 's your Bible , Yancey ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the capacious skirt of his Prince Albert to produce in triumphthe Word of God . " Come in or stay out , boys . No loafing in the doorway . " With Sabra on his arm he marched through the close-packed tent . " They 've saved two seats for you and Cim down fron  --  r should have . Yes , there they are . " Sabra felt faint . She had seen the foxlike face of Lon Yountis in the doorway . " That man , " she whispered to Yancey . " He was there . He looked at you as you passed b  --  e looked at you so " That 's fine , honey . Better than I hoped for . Nothing I like better than to have members of my flock right under my eye . " 141 1ixRANGED along the rear of the tent were the Indians . Osages , Poncas , Cherokees , Creeks . They had come from miles around . The Osages wore their blankets , striped orange , purple , green , scarlet , blue . The bucks wore hat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads . The thin snaky braids of their long black hair hung like wire ropes over their shoulders and down their breasts . Though they wore , for the most part , the checked gingham shirt of the white man there was always about them the gleam of metal , the flash of some brightly dyed fabric , the pattern of colored beads . The older women were shapeless bundles , with the exception of those of the Osage tribe . The Osage alone had never intermarried with the negro . Except for intermingled white blood , the tribe was pure . The Indian children tumbled all about . The savages viewed the proceedings impassively , their faces bronze masks in which only the eyes moved . Later , on their reservations , with no white man to see and hear , they would gossip like fishwives ; they would shake withlaughter ; they would retail this or that absurdity which , with their own eyes , they had seen the white man perform . They would slap their knees and rock with mirth . " Great jokers , the Indians @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sabra . She had felt sure that he was mistaken . They were sullen , taciturn , grave . They did not speak ; they grunted . They never laughed . Holding Cim 's hand tightly in her own , Sabra , escorted by Yancey , found that two chairs had been placed for them . Other fortunate ones sat perched on the saloon bar , on the gambling tables , on the benches , on upturned barrels . The rest of the congregation stood . Sabra glanced shyly about her . Me  --  undreds of men . They were strangely alike , all those faces ; young-old , weather-beaten , deeply seamed , and , for the most part , beardless . The Plains had taken them early , had scorched them with her sun , parched them with her drought , buffeted them with her wind , stung them with her dust . Sabra had grown accustomed to these faces during the past two weeks . But the wome  --  he was not prepared for the women . Calico and sunbonnets there were in plenty ; but the wives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show what they had in the way of finery ; dresses that they had brought with them from Kansas , from Texas , from Arkansas , from Colorado , carefully laid away in layers of papers which in turn were smoothed into pasteboard boxes or into trunks . Headgear trembled with wired roses . Cheviot and lady's-cloth and henrietta graced shoulders that had known only cotton this month past . Near her , and occupying one of the seats evidently reserved for persons of distinction , was a woman who must be , 143 lSabra thought , about her own age ; perhaps twenty or twenty-one , fair , blue eyed , almost childlike in her girlish slimness and purity of contour . She was very well dressed in a wine-color silk-warp henrietta , bustled , very tightly basqued , and elaborate with fluting on sleeves and collar . Dress and bonnet were city made and very modish . From Denver , Sabra thought , or Kansas City , or even Chicago . Sabra further decided , with feminine unreason , that her nose was the most exquisite feature of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not long endure this burning , wind-deviled climate and that the man beside her , who looked old enough to be her father , must be , after all , her husband . It was in the way he spoke to her , gazed at her , touched her , Yancey had pointed him out one day . She remembered his name because it had amused her at the time : Waltz , Evergreen Waltz . He was a notorious Southwest gambler , earned his living by the cards , and was supposed to be the errant son of the former governor of some state or othe  --  he thought it was Texas . The girl looked unhappy ; and beneath that , rebellious . Still , the sight of this lovely face , and of the other feminine faces looking out from at least fairly modish and decent straw bonnets and toques , gave Sabra a glow of reassurance . Immediately this was quenched at the late , showy , and dramatic entrance , just before Yancey took his place , of a group of women of whom Sabra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the leader of this spectacular group , whose appearance caused a buzz and stir throughout the tent , had arrived in Osage only the day before , accompanied by a bevy of six young ladies . The group had stepped off the passen- 144 lger coach of the Katy at the town of Wahoo arrayed in such cinder-strewn splendor as to cause the depot loafers to reel . The Katy had not yet been brought as far as Osage . It terminated at Wahoo , twenty-two miles away . The vision , in her purple grosgrain silk , with a parasol to match , and two purple plumes in her hat , with her six gayly bedecked companions had mounted a buckboardamid much shrill clamor and many giggles and a striking display of ankle . In this crude vehicle , their silks outspread , their astounding parasols unfurled , they had bumped their way over the prairie to the town . Osage , since that first mad day of its beginning , had had its quota of shady ladies , but these had been radO led creatures , driftwood from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle aged , unsavory , and doubtless slightly subnormal mentally . These were different . The leader , a handsome blackhairedwoman of not more than twenty-two or - three , had taken for herself and her companions such rooms as they could get in the town . Osage gazed on the parasols , bedazzled . Within an hour it was known that the woman claimed the name of Dixie Lee . That she was a descendant of decayed Southern aristocracy . That her blooming companions boasted such fancy nomenclature as Cherry de St. Maurice , Carmen Brown , Belle Mansero , and the like . That the woman , shrewd as a man and sharp as a knife , had driven a bargain whereby she was to come into possession , at a stiff price , of the building known as the Elite Rooming House and Cafe , situated at the far end of Pawhuska Avenue , near the gambling tent ; and that she contemplated building a house of her own , planned for her own peculiar needs , if business1451- 1warranted . Finally , she brought the news , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be extended to Osage and perhaps beyond it . Thus harlotry , heretoforea sordid enough slut in a wrapper and curling pins , came to Osage in silks and plumes , with a brain behind it and a promise of prosperity in its gaudy train . Dixie Lee , shrewd saleswoman , had been quick to learn of Sunday 's meeting , and quicker still to see the advantage of this opportunity for a public advertisement of her business . So now , at Osage 's first church meeting , in marched the six , with Dixie Lee at their head making a seventh . They rustled in silks . The air of the closepackedtent became as suffocating with scent as a Persian garden at sunset . Necks were craned ; whispers became a buzz ; seats were miraculously found for these representatives of a recognized social order , as for visitingroyalty . The dazzling tent top , seeming to focus rather than disseminate the glare of the Oklahoma sun , cast its revealing spotlight upon painted cheeks and beaded lashes . The nude and lolling lady of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at them , open-mouthed , with the look of one who is surprised and vanquished by an enemy from her own camp . The hard-working worthy wives of Osage , in their cheviots and their faded bonnets and cotton gloves , suddenly seemed sallow , scrawny , and almost spectacularly unalluring . All this Sabra beheld in a single glance , as did the entire congregation . Only the Indians , standing or squatting in a row at the back , like an Egyptian frieze against the white of the tent , remained unagitated , remote . Yancey , having lifted Cim into the chair next1461his mother , looked up at the entrance of this splendid procession . " God Almighty ! " he said . His tone was as irreverent as the words were sacred . A dull flush suffused his face , a thing so rare in him as to startle Sabra more than the words he had uttered or the tone in which he had said them . " What is it ? Yancey ! What 's wrong ? " " That 's the girl . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Le  --  he 's the girl in the black tights and the skullcap . . . in the Run . . . on the thoroughbred . . . " he was whispering . " Oh , no ! " cried Sabra , aloud . It was wrung from her . Those near by stared . So this was the church meeting toward which she had looked with such hope , such happy assurance . Harlots , pictures of nude women , Indians , heat , glare , her house probably blazing at this moment , Isaiah welteringin his own gore , Lon Yountis 's sinister face sneeringin the tent entrance . And now this woman , unscrupulous , evil , who had stolen Yancey 's quarter section from him by a trick . Yancey made his way through the close-packed crowd , leaped to the top of the roulette table which was to be his platform , flung his broad-brimmed white sombrero dexterously to the outjutting base of a suspended oil lamp , where it spun and then clung , cocked rakishly ; and , lifting the great lolling head , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . Probably never in the history of the Christian re-147 lligion had the Word of God been preached by so romanticand dashing a figure . His long black locks curled on his shoulders ; the fine eyes glowed ; the Prince Albert swayed with his graceful movements ; his six-shooters , one on each side , bulged reassuringly in their holsters . His thrilling voice sounded through the tent , stilling its buzz and movement . " Friends and fellow citizens , I have been called on to conduct this opening meeting of the Osage First Methodist , Episcopal , Lutheran , Presbyterian , Congregational , Baptist , Catholic , Unitarian Church . In the course of my career as a lawyer and an editor I have been required to speak on varied occasions and on many subjects . I have spoken in defense of my country and in criticism of it ; I have been called on to defend and to convict horse thieves , harlots , murderers , samples of which professions could doubtless be found in any large gathering in the Indian Territory to-day . I name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good or for evil , the fact remains that any man or woman , for whatever purpose , found in this great Oklahoma country to-day is here because in his or her veins , actuated by motives lofty or base , there is the spirit of adventure . I ask with Shakespeare , Why should a man , whose blood is warm within , sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster ? ' Though I know the Bible from cover to cover , and while many of its passages and precepts are graven on my heart and in my memory , this , fellow citizens of Osage , is the first time that I have been required to speak the Word of God in His Temple . " He glanced around the gaudy , glaring tent . " For any shelter , however sordid , however humbl  --  o offense , Gra  --  ecomes , while His Wordis spoken within it , His Temple . Suppose , then , that we unite in spirit by uniting in song . We have , you will notice , no hymn books . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inevitably , glorious history of the city of Osage by singin  --   --  hat do you all know boys , anyway ? " There was a moment 's slightly embarrassing pause . The hard-bitten faces of the motley congregation stared blankly up at Yancey . Yancey , self-possessed , vibrant , looked warmly down on them . He raised an arm in encouragement . " Come on , boys ! Name it ! Any suggestions , ladies and gentlemen ? " " How about Who Were You At Home ? just for a starter , " called out a voice belonging to a man with a shining dome-shaped bald head and a flowing silky beard , reddish in color . He was standing near the rear of the tent . It was Shanghai Wiley , up from Texas ; owner of more than one hundred thousand long-horn cattle and of the Rancho Palacios , on Tres Palacios Creek . He was the most famous cattle singer in the whole Southwest , besides being one of its richest cattle and land owners . Possessed of a remarkably high sweet tenor voice that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ known to quiet a whole herd of restless cattle on the verge of a mad stampede . It was an art he had learned when a cowboy on the range . Many cowboys had it , but none possessed the magic soothing quality of Shanghai 's voice . It was reputed to have in it the sorceryof the superhuman . It was told of him that in a milling herd , their nostrils distended , their flanks heaving , he had been seen to leap from the back of one maddenedsteer to another , traveling the moving mass that148 1491was like a shifting sea , singing to them in his magic tenor , stopping them just as they were about to plunge into the Rio Grande . Yancey acknowledged this suggestion with a grateful wave of the hand . " That 's right , Shanghai . Thanks for speaking up . A good song , though a little secular for the occasion , perhaps . But anyway , you all know it , and that 's the main thing . Kindly favor us with the pitch , will you , Shanghai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soprano voices ? Now , then , all together ! " It was a well-known song in the Territory where , on coming to this new and wild country , so many settlers with a checkere  --  ot to say plai  --  ast had found it convenient to change their names . The congregation took it up feelingly , almost sol-emnly : Who were you at home ? Who were you at home ? God alone remembersEre you first began to roam . Jack or Jo or Bill or Pete , Anyone you chance to meet , Sure to hit it just as neat , Oh , who were you at home ? " Now , all together ! Again ! " Somebody in the rear suddenly produced an accordion , and from the crowd perched on the saloon bar came the sound of a jew 's harp . The chorus now swelled with all the fervor of song 's ecstasy . They might have been singing Onward , Christian Soldiers . Through it all , high and clear , sounded Shanghai Wiley 's piercing tenor , like brasses in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ' cello of Yancey Cravat 's powerful , rich barytone . Oh , WHO were you at home ? WHO were you at HOME ? They had not risen to sing for the reason that most of the congregation was already standing , and the few who were seated were afraid to rise for fear that their seats would be snatched from under them . Sabra had joined in the singing , not at first , but later , timidly . It had seemed , somehow , to relieve her . This , she thought , was better . Perhaps , after all , this new community was about to make a proper beginning . Yancey , she thought , looked terribly handsome , toweringthere on the roulette table , his eyes alight , his slim foot , in its shining boot , keeping time to the music . She began to feel prim and good and settled at last . " Now , then , " said Yancey , all aglow , " the next thing in order is to take up the collection before the sermon . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yancey fixed him with a pitying gray eye . " Because , you Spanish infidel , part of a church service is taking up a collection . Southwest Davis , I appoint you to work this side of the house . Ike Bixler , you take that side . The collection , fellow citizens , ladies and gentleme  --  nd you , too , Pet  --  s for the new church organ . " " Why , hell , Yancey , we ai n't even got a church ! " bawled Pete again , aggrieved . " That 's all right , Pete . Once we buy an organ we 'll have to build a church to put it in . Stands to reason . Members of the congregation , anybody putting in less 15111 ' than two bits will be thrown out of the tent by me . Indians not included . " The collection was taken up , in two five-gallon sombreros , the contents of which , as they passed from one hairy sunburned paw to the next , were watched with eagle eyes by Southwest Davis and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entire gathering . The sombreros were then solemnly and with some hesitation brought to the roulette table pulpit for Yancey 's inspection . " Mr. Grat Gotch , being used to lightning calculations in the matter of coins , will kindly count the proceeds of the collection . " Arkansas Grat , red-faced and perspiring , elbowed his way to the pulpit and made his swift and accurate count . He muttered the result to Yancey . Yancey announcedit publicly . " Fellow citizens , the sum of the first collection for the new church organ for the Osage church , whose denomination shall be nameless , is the gratifying total of one hundred and thirty-three dollars and fifty-five cents. ? Heh , wait a minute , Grat ! Fiftyfive -- didyou say fifty-five cents ? " " That 's right , Yancey . " Yancey 's eye swept his flock . " Some miserable tightfistedskinflint of a But maybe it was a Ponca or an Osage , by mistake . " " How about a Cherokee , Yancey ! " came a taunting voice from somewhere in the rear . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the squeak . A Cheroke  --  s you 'd know if you knew anything at al  --  ou and Yountis and the rest of your outfi  --  s too smart to put anything in the contribution box of a race that has robbed him of his birthright . " He 152 ) did not pause for the titter that went round . He now took from the rear pocket of the flowing Prince Albert the small and worn little Bible . " Friends ! We 've come to the sermon . What I have to say is going to take fifteen minutes . The first five minutes are going to be devoted to a confession by me to you , and I did n't expect to make it when I accepted the job of conducting this church meeting . Walt Whitma  --  ay , boys , there 's a poet with red blood in him , and the feel of the land , and a love of his fellow beings ! ? Walt Whitman has a line that has stuck in my memory . It is : I say the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . ' That 's what Walt says . And that 's the text I intended to use for the subject of my sermon , though I know that the Bible should furnish it . And now , at the eleventh hour , I 've changed my mind . It 's from the Good Book , after all . I 'll announce my text , and then I 'll make my confession , and following that , any time left will be devoted to the sermon . Any lady or gent wishing to leave the tent will kindly do so now , before the confession , and with my full consent , or remain in his or her seat until the conclusion of the service , on pain of being publicly held up to scorn by me in the first issue of my newspaper , the Oklahoma Wigwam , due off the press next Thursday . Anyone wishing to leave the tent kindly rise now and pass as quietly as may be to the rear . Please make way for all departin  --   --  or-shipers . " An earthquake might have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expectant gathering : certainlyno lesser cataclysm of nature . Yancey waited , Bible in hand , a sweet and brilliant smile on his face. 153 lHe waited quietly , holding the eyes of the throng in that stifling tent . A kind of power seemed to flow from him to them , drawing them , fixing them , enthralling them . Yet in his eyes , and in the great head raised now as it so rarely was , there was that which sent a warning pang of fear through Sabra . She , too , felt his magnetic draw , but mingled with it was a dreadful terro  --  stab of premonition . The little pitted places in the skin of forehead and cheeks were somehow more noticeable . Twice she had seen his eyes look like that . Yancey waited yet another moment . Then he drew a long breath . " My text is from Proverbs . There is a lion in the way ; a lion is in the streets . ' Friends , there is a lion in the streets of Osage , our fair city , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lion is in the streets . And I have been a liar and a coward and an avaricious knave . For I pretended not to have knowledge which I have ; and I went about asking for information of this lio  --  hough I would change the word lion to jackal or dirty skunk if I did not feel it to be sacrilege to take liberties with Holy Wri  --  hen already I had proof positive of his guil  --  roof in writing , for which I paid , and about which I said nothing . And the reason for this deceit of mine I am ashamed to confess to you , but I shall confess it . I intended to announce to you all todaythat I had this knowledge , and I meant to announceto you from this pulpit ? " he glanced down at the roulette table ? " from this platfor  --  hat I would publish this knowledge in the columns of the Oklahoma Wigwam on Thursday , hoping thereby to gain profit and fame because of the circulation which this would gain for my paper , starting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 154 1 " bang , " uttered with much vehemence , the congregation of Osage 's First Methodist , Episcopal , Lutheran , etc. , church jumped noticeably and nervously . " Friends and fellow citizens , I repent of my greed and of my desire for self-advancement at the expense of this community . I no longer intend to withhold , for my own profit , the name of the jackal in a lion 's skin who , by threats of sudden death , has held this town abjectly terrorized . I stand here to announce to you that the name of that skunk , that skulking fiend and soulless murderer who shot down Jack Pegler when his back was turne  --  hat coward and poltroon ? " he was gesturing with his Bible in his hand , brandishing it aloft ? " was none other than " He dropped the Bible to the floor as if by accident , in his rage . As he stooped for it , on that instant , there was the crack of a revolver , a bullet from a six-shooter in the rear of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , and there appeared in the white surface of the tent a tiny circlet of blue that was the Oklahoma sky . But before that dot of blue appeared Yancey Cravat had raised himself halfway from the hips , had fired from the waist without , seemingly , pausing to take aim . His thumb flicked the hammer . That was all . The crack of his six-shooter was , in fact , so close on the heels of that first report that the two seemed almost simultaneous . The congregation was now on its feet , en masse , its back to the roulette table pulpit . Its eyes were on one figure ; its breath was suspended . That figur  --  man ? was seen to perform some curious antics . He looked , first of all , surprised . With his left hand he had gripped one of the taut tent ropes , and now , with his hand still155 lligrasping the hempen line , his fingers slipping gently along it , as though loath to let go , he sank to the floor , sat there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand 's hold of the rope , turned slightly , rolled over on one side and lay there , quite still . " ? Lon Yountis , " finished Yancey , neatly concludinghis sentence and now holding an ivory-mounted sixshooterin right and left hand . Screams . Shouts . A stampede for the door . Then the voice of Yancey Cravat , powerful , compelling , above the roar . He sent one shot through the dome of the tent to command attention . " Stop ! Stand where you are ! The first person who stampedes this crowd gets a bullet . Shut that tent flap , Jesse , like I told you to this morning . Louie Hefner , remove the body and do your duty . " " Okeh , Yancey . It 's self-defense and justifiable homicide . " " I know it . Louie , . . . Fellow citizens ! We will forego the sermon this morning , but next Sabbath , if requested . I shall be glad to take the pulpit again , unless a suitable and ordained minister of God can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be from Proverbsxxvi , 27 : Whoso diggeth a pit shall fall therein ' ... This church meeting , brethren and sisters , will now be concluded with prayer . " There was a little thudding , scuffling sound as a heavy , inert burden was carried out through the tent flap into the noonday sunshine . His six-shooters still in his hands , Yancey Cravat bowed his magnificent buffalo hea  --  ut not too fa  --  nd sent the thrilling tones of his beautiful voice out into the agitated crowd before him. " ... bless this community , 0 Lord . . . . " 1561V1 OURNFULLY , and in accordance with the custom of the community , Yancey carved a notch in the hangsome ivory and silver-mounted butt of his six-shooter . It was then for the first time that Sabra , her eyes widening with horror , noticed that there were five earlier notches cut in the butts of Yancey 's two gun  --  wo on one , three on the other . This latest addition brought the number up to six . Aghast , she gingerly investigated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not worn completelyencased in the holster but each was held within it by an ingenious steel clip , elastic and sensitive as a watch spring . This spring gripped the barrel securely and yet so lightly that the least effort would set it free . Yancey could pull his gun and thumb the hammer with but one motion , instead of two . The infinitesimal saving of time had saved his life that day . " Oh , Yancey , you have n't killed six men ! " " I 've never killed a man unless I knew he 'd kill me if I didn't.

As the printing plant boasted only a little hand press , the two six-column forms had to be inked with a hand roller . Over this was placed the damp piece of white print paper . Each sheet was done by hand . The first issue of the Oklahoma Wigwam numbered four hundred and fifty copies , and before it was run off , Yancey , Jesse Rickey , Sabra , Isaia  --  very member of the householdexcept little Ci  --  ad taken a turn at the roller . Sabra 's back and arm muscles ached for a week . Yancey made vigorous protest . " What ! Ink on the white wonder of dear Juliet 's hand ! Out , damned spot ! See here , honey . This will never do . My sweet Southern jasmine working over a miserable roller ! I 'd rather never get out a paper , Ji tell you . " " It looks as if you never would , anyway .

Clay in which beauty and virtue triumphed over evil . An instalment of this would appear weekly . The second half of it was missing . But Sabra sagely decided that this fragment , for a time at least , would compensate the feminine readers of the Oklahoma Wigwam for the preponderance of civic and political matter and the scarcity of social and personal items . She made up her mind that she would conquer her shyness and become better acquainted with some of those cheviots and straw bonnets seen at the Sunday church meeting . Yancey and Jesse Rickey seemed to have some joke between them . Sabra , in her kitchen , could hear them snickering like a couple of schoolgirls . They were up to some mischief . Yancey was possessed of the rough and childlike notion of humor that was of the day and place . " What are you boys up to ? " she asked him at dinner . He was all innocence . " Nothing . Not a thing ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The paper came out on i hursday afternoon , as scheduled . Sabra was astonished and a little terrified to see the occasion treated as an event , with a crowd of cowboys and local citizens in front of the house , pistols fired , whoops and yells ; and Yancey himself , aided by Jesse Rickey , handing out copies as if they had cost nothing to print . Perhaps twenty-five of these were distributed , opened eagerly , perused by citizens leaning against the porch posts , and by cowboys on horseback , before Sabra , peeking out of the office window , saw an unmistakable look of surpris  --  ven of shoc  --  n theirdeleted linessocial order for the good wives of the community . All her life Sabra had been accustomed to the open-handed hospitality of the South . The Venable household in Wichita had been as nearly as possible a duplicate of the Mississippi mansion which had housed generations of Sabra 's luxury-loving and open-handed ancestors . Hordes of relatives came and went . Food and drink were constantly being passed in abundance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative tinkle of the handsome old square piano with its great blobs of grapevine carving . Friends drove up for midday dinner and stayed a week . Felice Venable 's musical drawl was always tempting the sated guest to further excesses .

Mittie , pass the currant jell . " Grimly Sabra ( and , in time , the other virtuous women of the community ) set about making this new frontier town like the old as speedily as possible . Yancey , almost single handed , tried to make the new as unlike the old as possible . He fought a losing fight from the first . He was muddled ; frequently insincere ; a brilliant swaggerer . He himself was not very clear as to what he wanted , or how to go about getting it . He only knew that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , injustice , and dishonesty in office were everywhere ; that here , in this wild and virgin land , was a chance for a Utopian plan . But he had no plan . He was sentimental about the under dog ; overgallant to women ; emotional , quick-tempered , impulsive , dramatic , ideal-166istic . And idealism does not flourish in a frontier settlement . Yancey Cravat , with his unformed dreams ? much less the roistering play boys of saloon and plain and gambling hous  --  ever had a chance against the indomitable materialism of the women . Like Sabra , most of the women had brought with them from their homes in Nebraska , in Arkansas , in Missouri , in Kansas , some household treasure that in their eyes represented elegance or which was meant to mark them as possessed of taste and background . A chair , a bed , a piece of silver , a vase , a set of linen . It was the period of the horrible gimcrack . Women all over the country were covering wire bread toasters with red plush , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole with satin ribbons and hanging it on the wall to represent a paper rack ( to be used on pain of death ) . They painted the backsides of frying pans with gold leaf and daisies , enhanced the handles of these , too , with bows of gay ribbon and , the utilitarian duckling tbqus turned into a swan , hung it on the wall opposite the toaster . Rolling pins were gilded or sheathed in velvet . Coal scuttles and tin shovels were surprised to find themselves elevated from the kitchen to the parlor , having first been subjected to the new beautifying process . Sabra 's house became a sort of social center following the discovery that she received copies of Harper 's Bazar with fair regularity . Felice Venable sometimes sent it to her , prompted , no doubt , by Sabra 's rather guarded account of the lack of style hints for the person or for the home in this new community .

She then graciously printed these instructions in the Oklahoma Wigwam , causing a flurry of excitement in a hundred homes and mystifying the local storekeepersby the sudden demand for jars. of former trips to Chicago during which she had reveled in the culture of that effete city . Yancey was heard learnedly discoursing to her on the subject of Etruscan pottery , of which he knew nothing . The ex-school teacher rolled her eyes and tossed her head a good deal . " You do n't know what a privilege it is , Mr. Cravat , to find myself talking to someone whose mind can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yancey 's ardent eyes took on their most melting look . " Madam , it is you who have carried me with you to your heights . In youth and beauty wisdom is but rare ! ' It was simply his way . He could not help it . " Ah , Shakespeare ! " breathed Mrs. Wyatt , bridling . " Shakespeare hell ! " said Yancey to Sabra , later . " She does n't know Pope when she hears him . No woman ought to pretend to be intelligent . And if she is she ought to have the intelligence to pretend she is n't . And this one looks like Cornelia Blimber , to boot . " " Cornelia ? ... " " A schoolmarm in Dickens 's Dombey and Son .

" " Because she is so plain , darling . " " It 's just that you ca n't bear not to have everybody think you 're fascinating . " She never read Dombey and Son , after all . She decided 170that she preferred exchanging recipes and discussing the rearing of children with the other women to the more intellectual conversation of Mrs. Wyatt . It was Sabra who started the Philomathean Club . The other women clutched at the idea . It was part of their defense against these wilds . After all , a town that boasted a culture club could not be altogether lost . Sabra had had no experience with this phase of social activity . The languorous yet acid Felice Venable had always scorned to take part in any civic social life that Wichita knew . Kansas , even then , had had its women 's clubs , though they were not known by this title . The Ladies ' Sewing Circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; the Hypatias .

Besides , I do n't believe in women running around to club meetings . They 'll be going into politics next . " Sabra timidly approached Mrs. Wyatt with her plan to form a woman 's club , and Mrs. Wyatt snatched at it with such ferocity as almost to make it appear her own idea . Each was to invite four women of the town 's Elite . Ten , they decided , would be enough as charter members . " I , " began Mrs. Wyatt promptly , " am going to ask Mrs. Louie Hefner , Mrs. Doc Nisbett deleted linesMrs .

She was annoyingly proud of this , and referred to it on all possible occasions . " The first meeting , " she said , " will be held at my house , of course . It will be so much nicer . " She did not say nicer than what , but Sabra 's face set itself in a sort of mask of icy stubbornness . " The first meeting of the Philomathean Society will be held at the home of the Founder . " After all , Mrs. Wyatt 's house could not boast a screen door , as Sabra 's could . It was the only house in Osage that had one . Yancey had had Hefner order it from Kansas City . The wind and the flies seemed to torture Sabra . It was so unusual a luxury that frequently strangers came to the door by mistake , thinking that here was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door in the town . " I 'll serve coffee and doughnuts , " Sabra added , graciously . " And I 'll move to elect you president . I " ? this not without a flick of malice ? " am too busy with my household and my child and the newspaper ? I often assist my husband editorially ' ? to take up with any more work . " The paper on Mrs. Browning 's " Aurora Leigh " never was written by the pretty Mrs. Evergreen Waltz . Three days later Sabra , chancing to glance out of her sittingroomwindow , saw the crippled and middle-aged gamblerpassing her house , and in spite of his infirmity he was walking with great spee  --  unning , almost . In his hand 1741 1751was a piece of white pape  --  letter , Sabra thought . She hoped it was not bad news . He had looked , she thought , sort of odd and wild . Evergreen Waltz , after weeks of tireless waiting and watching , had at last intercepted a letter from his young wife 's lover . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat at the window , sewing . The single shot went just through the center of the wide white space between her great babyish blue eyes . They found her with the gold initialed thimble on her finger , and the bit of work on which she had been sewing , now brightly spotted with crimson , in her lap . " Why did n't you tell me that when she married him she was a girl out of  --  ut of  --  ouse ! " Sabra demanded , between horror and wrath . " I thought you knew . Women are supposed to have intuition , or whatever they call it , are n't they ? All those embroidered underthings on the line in a town where water 's scarce as champagn  --  carcer . And then Aurora Leigh . " She was thoroughly enraged by now . " What , for pity 's sake , has Aurora Leigh ' got to do with her ! " He got down the volume . " I thought you 'd been reading it yourself , perhaps . " He opened it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ XiSABRA 'S second child , a girl , was born in June , a little more than a year after their coming to Osage . It was not as dreadful an ordeal there in those crude surroundings as one might have thought . She refused to send for her mother ; indeed , Sabra insisted that Felice Venable be told nothing of the event until after her granddaughter had wailed her way into the Red Man 's country . Yancey had been relieved at Sabra 's decision . The thought of his luxury-loving and formidable mother-inlawwith her flounced dimities and her high-heeled slippersin the midst of this Western wallow to which he had brought her daughter was a thing from which even the redoubtable Yancey shrank . Curiously enough , it was not the pain , the heat , nor the inexpert attention she received that most distressed Sabra . It was the wind . The Oklahoma wind tortured her . It rattled the doors and windows ; it whirled the fed dust through the house ; its hot breath was on her agonized face as she lay there ; if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ snatching the cloth off the table , the sheets off the bed , the dishes off the shelves . " The wind ! " Sabra moaned . " The wind ! The wind ! Make it stop . " She was a little delirious . " Yancey ! With your gun . Shoot it . Seven notches . I do n't care . Only stop it . " She was tended , during her accouchement , by the best doctor in the county and certainly the most picturesque man of medicine in the whole Southwest , Dr. Don Valliant . Like thousands of others living in this new country , his past was his own secret . He rode to his calls on horseback , in a black velveteen coat and velveteen trousers tucked into fancy leather boots . His soft black hat , rivaling Yancey 's white one , intensified the black of his eyes and hair . It was known that he often vanishedfor days , leaving the sick to get on as best they could . He would reappear as inexplicably as he had vanished ; and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ horse was jaded . It was no secret that he was often called to attend the bandits when one of their number , wounded in some outlaw raid , had taken to their hiding place in the Hills . He was tender and deft with Sabra , though between them he and Yancey consumed an incredible quantity of whisky during the racking hours of her confinement . At the end he held up a caterwauling morsel of flesh torn from Sabra 's fles  --  thing perfect of its kind , with an astonishing mop of black hair . " This is a Spanish beauty you have for a daughter , Yancey . I present to you Senorita Dona Cravat . " And Donna Cravat she remained . The town , somewhatscandalized , thought she had been named afterf 177Dr . Don himself . Besides , they did not consider Donna a name at all . The other women of the community fed their hunger for romance by endowing their girl children with such florid names as they could conjure up out of their imagination or from the novels they read between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pathetic to the ridiculous . Czarina McKee ; Emmeretta Folsom ; Gazelle Slaughter ; Maurine Turket ; Cassandra Sipes ; Jewel Riggs . The neighborhood wives showered the Cravat householdwith the customary cakes , pies , meat loaves , and bowls of broth . Black Isaiah was touching , was wonderful . He washed dishes , he mopped floors , he actually cooked as though he had inherited the art from Angie , his vast black mother , left behind in Wichita . One of Sabra 's gingham kitchen aprons , checked blue.and white , was always hitched up under his arms , and beneath this utilitarian yet coquettish garment his great bare feet slapped in and out as he did the work of the household . He was utterly fascinated by the new baby . " Looka dat ! She know me ! Hi , who yo ' rollin ' yo ' eyes at , makin ' faces ! " He danced for her , he sang negro songs to her , he rocked her to sleep . He was , as Donna grew older , her nursemaid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and later still her playmate as well as Cim 's . When Sabra Cravat arose from that bed something in her had crystallized . Perhaps it was that , for the first time in a year , she had had hours in which to rest her tired limbs ; perhaps the ordeal itself worked a psychic as well as a physical change in her ; it might have been that she realized she must cut a new pattern in this178Oklahoma life of theirs . The boy Cim might surmount it ; the girl Donna never . During the hours through which she had lain in her bed in the stifling wooden shack , mists seemed to have rolled away from before her eyes . She saw clearly . She felt light and terribly capabl  --  o much so that she made the mistake of getting up , dizzily donning slippers and wrapper , and tottering into the newspaper office where Yancey was writing an editorial and shouting choice passages of it into the inattentive ear of Jesse Rickey , who was setting type in the printing shop. " . the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a civilized country .... " He looked up to see in the doorway a wraith , all eyes and long black braids . " Why , sugar ! What 's this ? You ca n't get up ! " She smiled rather feebly . " I 'm up . I felt so light , " I should think you would . All that physic . " " I feel so strong . I 'm going to do so many things . You 'll see . I 'm going to paper the whole house . Rosebuds in the bedroom . I 'm going to plant two trees in the front . I 'm going to start another clu  --  ot like the Philomathea  --  think that 's silly no  --  ut one to make this town . . . no saloons . . . women like that Dixie Lee . . . going to have a real hired girl as soon as the newspaper begins to . . . feel so queer . . . Yancey ... " As she began to topple , Yancey caught the Osage Joan of Arc @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper the entire house , aided by Isaiah and Jesse Rickey . Isaiah 's ebony countenance splashed with the white paste mixture 179 lsomade a bizarre effect , a trifle startling to anyone coming upon the scene unawares . Also Jesse Rickey 's inebriate eye , which so often resulted in many grotesque pied print lines appearing in unexpected and inconvenient places in the Oklahoma Wigwam columns , was none too dependable in the matching of rosebud patterns . The result , in spots , was Burbankian , with roses grafted on leaves and tendrils emerging from petals . Still , the effect was gay , even luxurious . The Philomathean Club , as one woman , fell upon wall paper and paste pot , as they had upon the covered jars in Sabra 's earlier effort at decoration . Withina month Louie Hefner was compelled to install a full line of wall paper to satisfy the local demand . Slowly , slowly , the life of the community , in the beginningso wild , so unrelated in its parts , began to weave in and out , warp and woof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faint , almost undiscernible . But presently the eye could trace here a motif , there a figure , here a motif , there a figure . The shuttle swept back , forward , back , forward . " It 's almost time for the Jew , " Sabra would say , looking up from her sewing . " I need some number forty sewing-machine needles . " And then perhaps next day , or the day after , Cim , playing in the yard , would see a familiar figure , bent almost double , gnomelike and grotesque , against the western sky . It was Sol Levy , the peddler , the Alsatian Jew . Cim would come running into the house , Donna , perhaps , trotting at his heels . " Mom , here comes theJew ! " Sabra would fold up her work , brush the threads 18o from her apron ; or if her hands were in the dough she would hastily mold and crimp her pie crust so as to be ready for his visit . Sol Levy had come over an immigrant in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was blue-black and very thick , and his face was white in spite of the burning Southwest sun . A black stubble of beard intensifiedthis pallor . He had delicate blue-veined hands and narrow arched feet . His face was delicate , too , and narrow , and his eyes slanted ever so little at the outer corners , so that he had the faintly Oriental look sometimesseen in the student type of his race . He belonged in crowded places , in populous places , in the color and glow and swift drama of the bazaars . God knows how he had found his way to this vast wilderness . Perhaps in Chicago , or in Kansas City , or Omaha he had heard of this new country and the rush of thousands for its land . And he had bummed his way on foot . He had started to peddle with an oilcloth-covered pack on his back . Through the little hot Western towns in summer . Through the bitter cold Western towns in winter . They turned the dogs on him . The children cried , " Jew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disguised with that stubble of beard . He would enter the yard of a farmhouse or a dwelling in a town such as Osage . A wary eye on the dog . Nice Fido . Nice doggie . Down , down ! Pins , sewing-machine needles , rolls of gingham and calico , and last , craftily , his Hamburg lace . Hamburg lace for the little girls ' petticoats , for the aprons of the lady of the house ; the white muslin apron edged with Hamburg lace , to be donned after the midday dinner dishes were done , the house set to rights , her hair tidied with a wet comb , thedeleted linesHe was the town Jew . He was a person apart . Sometimes the cowboys deviled him ; or the saloon loungers and professionalbad men . They looked upon him as fair game . He thought of them as savages . Yancey came to his rescue one day in the spectacular fashion he enjoyed . Seated at his desk in the Wigwam office Yancey heard hoots , howls , catcalls , and then the crack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunny Southwest Saloon was filled with grinning faces beneath sombreros . In the middle of the dusty road , his back against a Howe scale , stood Sol Levy . They had tried to force him to drink a great glass of whisky straight . He had struggled , coughed , sputtered ; had succeeded in spitting out the burning stuff . They had got another . They were holding it up from their vantage point on the porch . Their sixshooterswere in their hands . And they were shooting at hi  --  t his feet , at his head , at his hands , expertly , devilishly , miraculously , never hitting him , but always careful to come within a fraction of an inch . He had no weapon . He would not have known how to use it if he had possessed one . He was not of a race of fighters . " Drink it ! " the yells were high and less than human . " You 're a dead Jew if you do n't . Dance , gol darn you ! Dance for your drink @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past his ears , whipped up the dust about his feet . He did not run . He stood there , facing them , frozen with fear . His arms hung at his sides . His face was deathly white . They had shot off his hat . He was bareheaded . His eyes were sunken , suffering , stricken . His head lolled a little on one side . His thick black locks hung dank on his forehead . At that first instant of seeing him as he rushed 184 out of his office , Yancey thought , subconsciously , " He looks lik  --  ike But the resemblance eluded him then . It was only later , after the sickening incident had ended , that he realized of Whom it was that the Jew had reminded him as he stood there , crucified against the scale . Yancey ran into the road . It is impossible to say how he escaped being killed by one of the bullets . He seemed to leap into the thick of them like a charmed thing . As he ran he whipped out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crowd on the saloon porch made a dash for the door and were caught in it and fell sprawling , and picked themselves up , and crawled or ran again until they were inside . Yancey stood beside Sol Levy , the terrible look in his eyes , the great head thrust forward and down , like a buffalo charging . Here was a scene to his liking . " I 'll drill the first son of a bitch that fires another shot . I will , so help me God ! Go on , fire now , you dirty dogs . You filthy loafers . You stinking spawn of a rattle-snake ! " He was , by now , a person in the communit  --  e was , in fact , the person in the town . The porch loafers looked sheepish . They sheathed their weapons , or twirled them , sulkily . " Aw , Yancey , we was foolin ' ! " " We was only kiddin ' the Jew . . . . Lookit him , the white-livered son of a gun . Lookit -- Holy Doggie , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With a little sigh Sol Levy slid to the dust of the road and lay in a crumpled heap at the foot of the Howe scale . It was at that moment , so curiously does the18511human mind work , that Yancey caught that elusive resemblance . Now he picked the man up and flung him over his great shoulder as he would a sack of meal . " Yah ! " hooted the jokesters , perhaps a little shamefacednow . Yancey , on his way to his own house so near by , made first a small detour that brought him to the foot of the tobacco-stained saloon porch steps . His eyes were like two sword blades flashing in the sun . " Greasers ! Scum of the Run ! Monkey skulls ! " His limp burden dangling over his shoulder , he now strode through the Wigwam office , into the house , and laid him gently down on the sitting-room couch . Revived , Sol Levy stopped to midday dinner with the Cravats . He sat , very white , very still , in his chair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked her to , though she was mystified , had got out her DeGrasse silver and a set of her linen . His long meager fingers dwelt lingeringly on the fine hand-wrought stuff . His deep-sunk haunting eyes went from Sabra 's clearcutfeatures , with the bold determined brows , to Yancey 's massive head , then to the dazzling freshness of the children 's artless countenances . " This is the first time that I have sat at such a table in two years . My mother 's table was like this , in the old country . My fathe  --  eace to his soul ! ? lighted the candles . My mothe  --  ainte  --  pread the table with her linen and her precious thin silver . Here in this country I eat as we would not have allowed a beggar to eat that came to the door for charity . " " This Oklahoma country 's no place for you , Sol . It 's too rough , too hard . You come of a race of dreamers . " 186 The melancholy eyes took on a remot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slight cast in them , as though he were turning his vision toward something the others could not see . " It will not always be like this . Wait . Those savages to-day will be myths , like the pictures of monsters you see in books of prehistoric days . " " Do n't worry about those dirty skunks , Sol . I 'll see that they leave you alone from now on . " Sol Levy smiled a little bitter smile . His thin shoulders lifted in a weary shrug . " Those barbarians ! My ancestorswere studying the Talmud and writing the laws the civilized world now lives by when theirs were swingingfrom tree to tree . " 187xiiIN THE three and a half years of her residence in Osage Sabra had yielded hardiy an inch . It was amazing . It was heroic . She had set herself certain standards , and those she had maintained in spite of almost overwhelmingopposition . She had been bred on tradition . If she had yielded at all it was in minor matters and because to do so was expedient @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her way to the butcher 's or the grocer 's shielded from the sun by one of the gingham sunbonnets which in the beginning she had despised . Certainly one could not don a straw bonnet , velvet or flower trimmed , to dart out in a calico house dress for the purchase of a pound and a half of round steak , ten cents , worth of onions , and a yeast cake . Once only in those three years had she gone back to Wichita . At the prospect of the journey she had been in a fever of anticipation for days . She had taken with her Cim and Donna . She was so proud of them , so intent on outfitting them-with a wardrobe sufficiently splendid to set off their charms , that she neglected the matter of her own costuming and found herself arriving in Wichita with a trunk containing the very clothes with which she had departed from it almost four years earlier . Prominent among these was the green nun 's veiling with the pink ruchings . She had had little enough use for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Your skin ! " Felice Venable had exclaimed at sight of her daughter . " Your hands ! Your hair ! As dry as a bone ! You look a million . What have you done to your-self ? " Sabra remembered something that Yancey once had said about Texas . Mischievously she paraphrased it in order to shock her tactless mother . " Oklahoma is fine for men and horses , but it 's hell on women and oxen . " The visit was not a success . The very things she had expected to enjoy fell , somehow , flat . She missed the pace , the exhilarating uncertainty of the Oklahoma life . The teacup conversation of her girlhood friends seemed to lack tang and meaning . Their existence was orderly , calm , accepted . For herself and the other women of Osage there was everything still to do . There lay a city , a county , a whole vast Territory to be swept and garnishedby an army of sunbonnets . Paradoxically enough , she was trying to implant in the red clay of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Wichita . Yet it was , perhaps , a very human trait . It was illustrated literally by the fact that she was , on her return , more thrilled to find that the scrawny elm , no larger than a baby 's arm , which she had planted outside the doorway in Osage , actually had found some moisture for its thirsty roots , and was now feebly vernal , than189 ? ; 1she had been at sight of the cool glossy canopy of cedar , arbor vitae , sweet locust , and crepe myrtle that shaded the Kansas garden . She took a perverse delight in bringingthe shocked look to the faces of her Wichita friends , and to all the horde of Venables and Marcys and Vians that swarmed up from the South to greet the pioneer . Curiously enough , it was not the shooting affrays and Indian yarns that ruffled them so much as her stories of the town 's social life. " . . . rubber boots to parties , often , because when it rains we wade up to our ankles in mud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sociables . . . . Mrs. Buckner 's sister came to visit her from St. Joseph , Missouri , and she remarked that she had noticed that the one pattern of table silver seemed to be such a favorite . She had seen it at all the little tea parties that had been given for her during her visit . Of course it was my set that had been the rounds . Everybody borrowed it . We borrow each other 's lamps , too , and china , and even linen . " At this the Venables and Marcys and Vians and Goforthslooked not only shocked but stricken . Chests of lavender-scented linen , sideboards flashing with stately silver , had always been part of the Venable and Marcy tradition . Then the children . The visiting Venables insisted on calling Cim by his full nam  --  imarron . Sabra had heard it so rarely since the day of his birth that she now realized , for the first time , how foolish she had been to yield to Yancey 's whim in the naming of the boy . Cimarron . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made such an obstreperous entrance into the world , and Yancey 190 1had shouted , in delight , " Look at him ! See him kick with his feet and strike out with his fists ! He 's a wild one . Heh , Cimarron ! Peceno Gitano . " Cousin Jouett Goforth or Cousin Dabney Venable said , pompously , " And now , Cimarron , my little man , tell us about the big red Indians . Did you ever fight Indians , eh , Cimarron ? " The boy surveyed them frombeneath his long lashes , his head lowered , looking for all the world like his father . Cimarron was almost eight now . If it is possible for a boy of eight to be romantic in aspect , Cimarron Cravat was that . His head was not large , like Yancey 's , butlong and fine , like Sabra '  --  Venable head . His eyes j l were Sabra 's , too , dark and large , but they had the ardent look of Yancey 's gray ones , and he had Yancey 's absurdly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His mannerism  --  he head held down , the rare upward glance that cut you like a sword thrust when he turned it full on yo  --  he swing of his walk , the way he gestured with his delicate hand  --  ll these wereYancey in startling miniature . 1 ; His speech was strangely adult . This , perhaps , be- i ' cause of his close association with his elders in those . first formative years in Osage . Yancey had delighted in talking to the boy ; in taking him on rides and drivesabout the broad burning countryside . His skin was bronzed the color of his father 's . He looked like a little patrician Spaniard or perhaps ( the Venables thought privately ) part Indian . Then , too , there had been few children of his age in the town 's beginning . Sabra had been , at first , too suspicious of such as there were . He ii would , probably , have seemed a rather unpleasant **28;0;TOOLONG took his hand from Effie Perine 's head and en tered the inner office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , raising her sad face for his kiss . He arms were around him before his held her . When the had kissed he made a little movement as if to release her but she pressed her face to his chest and began sobbingHe stroked her round back , saying : " Poor darling . ' His voice was tender . His eyes , squinting at the des : that had been his partner 's , across the room from hi own , were angry . He drew his lips back over his teet in an impatient grimace and turned his chin aside t. avoid contact with the crown of her hat . " Did you send for Miles 's brother ? " he asked . " Yes , he came over this morning . " The words wen blurred by her sobbing and his coat against her mouth . He grimaced again and bent his head for a surreptitiouslook at the watch on his wrist . His left arm was around her , the hand on her left shoulder . His cuff was pulled back far enough to leave the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his arms and raised her face again . Her blue eyes were wet , round , and white-ringed . Her mouth was moist . " Oh , Sam , " she moaned , " did you kill him ? " Spade stared at her with bulging eyes . His bony jaw fell down . He took his arms from her and stepped back out of her arms . He scowled at her and cleared his throat . She held her arms up as he had left them . Anguish clouded her eyes , partly closed them under eyebrows pulled up at the inner ends . Her soft damp red lips trembled . P31Spade laughed a harsh syllable , " Ha ! " and went to 1 he buff-curtained window . He stood there with his back to her looking through the curtain into the court until she started towards him . Then he turned quickly and went to his desk . He sat down , put his elbows on the desk , his chin between his fists , and looked at her . His yellowish eyes glittered between narrowed lids @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put that bright idea in your head ? " " I thought  --  " She lifted a hand to her mouth and fresh tears came to her eyes . She came to stand beside the desk , moving with easy sure-footed grace in black slippers whose smallness and heel-height were extreme . " Be kind to me , Sam , " she said humbly . He laughed at her , his eyes still glittering . " You killed my husband , Sam , be kind to me . " He clapped his palms together and said : " Jesus Christ . " She began to cry audibly , holding a white handkerchief to her face . He got up and stood close behind her . He put his arms around her . He kissed her neck between ear and coat-collar . He said : " Now , Iva , do n't . " His face was expressionless . When she had stopped crying he put his mouth to her ear and murmured : " You should n't have come here today , precious . It was n't wise . You ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around in his arms to face him and asked : " You 'll come tonight ? " He shook his head gently . " Not tonight . " " Soon ? " " Yes . " " How soon ? "   " As soon as I can . " He kissed her mouth , led her to the door , opened it , said , " Good-bye , Iva , " bowed her out , shut the door , and returned to his desk . He took tobacco and cigarette-papers from his vest pockets , but did not roll a cigarette . He sat holding th papers in one hand , the tobacco in the other , and look with brooding eyes at his dead partner 's desk . Effie Perine opened the door and came in . Her bro. eyes were uneasy . Her voice was careless . She asked " Well ? " Spade said nothing . His brooding gaze did not mo from his partner 's desk . The girl frowned and came around to his ski . " Well , " she asked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widow make out ? " " She thinks I shot Miles , " he said . Only his li moved . " So you could marry her ? " Spade made no reply to that . The girl took his hat from his head and put it o the desk . Then she leaned over and took the tobacco sack and the papers from his inert fingers . " The police think I shot Thursby , " he said . " Who is he ? " she asked , separating a cigarette-pap. from the packet , sifting tobacco into it . " Who do you think I shot ? " he asked . When she ignored that question he said : " Thursby ' the guy Miles was supposed to be tailing for the Won . derly girl . " Her thin fingers finished shaping the cigarette . Ship33licked it , smoothed it , twisted its ends , and placed it between Spade 's lips . He said , " Thanks , honey , " put ail arm around her slim waist , and rested his cheek wearily against her hip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ marry Iva ? " she asked , looking own at his pale brown hair . " Do n't be silly , " he muttered . The unlighted cigattebobbed up and down with the movement of his ' ps . " She does n't think it 's silly . Why should she  --  the ay you 've played around with her ? " He sighed and said : " I wish to Christ I 'd never seen " Maybe you do now . " A trace of spitefulness came to the girl 's voice . " But there was a time . " " I never know what to do or say to women except iat way , " he grumbled , " and then I did n't like Miles . " " That 's a lie , Sam , " the girl said . " You know I think he 's a louse , but I 'd be a louse too if it would give mea body like hers . " Spade rubbed his face impatiently against her hip , but said nothing . Effie Perine bit her lip , wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ view of his face , asked : " Do oil suppose she could have killed him ? " Spade sat up straight and took his arm from her waist . He smiled at her . Her smile held nothing but amusement . He took out his lighter , snapped on the flame , and applied it to the end of his cigarette . " You 're an angel , " he said tenderly through smoke , " a nice rattlerainedangel . " She smiled a bit wryly . " Oh , am I ? Suppose I told you that your Iva had n't been home many minutes when I arrived to break the news at three o'clock this morn-ing ? " " Are you telling me ? " he asked . His eyes had become alert though his mouth continued to smile . " She kept me waiting at the door while she undressed or finished undressing . I saw her clothes where she had dumped them on a chair . Her hat and coat were underneath . Her singlette , on top , was still warm . She said she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had wrinkled up the bed , but the wrinkles were n't mashed down . " Spade took the girl 's hand and patted it . " You 're a detective , darling , but "  --  he shook his head  --  " she did n't kill him . " Effie Perine snatched her hand away . " That louse wants to marry you , Sam , " she said bitterly . He made an impatient gesture with his head and one hand . She frowned at him and demanded : " Did you see her last night ? " " No . " " Honestly ? " " Honestly . Do n't act like Dundy , sweetheart . It ill becomes you . " " Has Dundy been after you ? " " Uh-huh . He and Tom Polhaus dropped in for a drink at four o'clock . " " Do they really think you shot this what's-his-name ? " " Thursby . " He dropped what was left of his cigarette into the brass tray and began to roll another . " Do they ? " she insisted . " God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasP35making . " They did have some such notion . I do n't know how far I talked them out of it . " " Look at me , Sam . " He looked at her and laughed so that for the momentmerriment mingled with the anxiety in her face . " You worry me , " she said , seriousness returning to her face as she talked . " You always think you know what you 're doing , but you 're too slick for your own good , and some day you 're going to find it out . " He sighed mockingly and rubbed his cheek against her arm . " That 's what Dundy says , but you keep Iva away from me , sweet , and I 'll manage to survive the rest of my troubles . " He stood up and put on his hat . " Rave the Spade c- Archer taken off the door and Samuel Spade put on . I 'll be back in an hour , or phone you . " Spade went through the St. Mark 's long purplish lobby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wonderly was in . The red-haired dandy turned away , and then back shaking his head . " She checked out this morning , Mr. Spade . " " Thanks . " Spade walked past the desk to an alcove off the lobby where a plump young-middle-aged man in dark clothes sat at a fiat-topped mahogany desk . On the edge of the desk facing the lobby was a triangular prism of mahogany and brass inscribed Mr. Freed . The plump man got up and came around the desk holding out his hand . " I was awfully sorry to hear about Archer , Spade , " he said in the tone of one trained to sympathize readily without intrusiveness . " I 've just seen it in the Call . He was in here last night , you know . " " Thanks , Freed . Were you talking to him ? " " No . He was sitting in the lobby when I came in early in the evening . I did n't stop . I thought he was probably working and I know you fellows like to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything to do with his  --  ? " " I do n't think so , but we do n't know yet . Anyway , we wo n't mix the house up in it if it can be helped . " " Thanks . " " That 's all right . Can you give me some dope on an ex-guest , and then forget that I asked for it ? " " Surely . " " A Miss Wonderly checked out this morning . I 'd like to know the details . " " Come along , " Freed said , " and we 'll see what we can learn . " Spade stood still , shaking his head . " I do n't want to show in it . " Freed nodded and went out of the alcove . In the lobby he halted suddenly and came back to Spade . " Harriman was the house-detective on duty last night , " he said . " He 's sure to have seen Archer . Shall I caution him not to mention it ? " Spade looked at Freed from the corners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't make any difference as long as there 's no connection shown with this Wonderly . Harriman'sall right , but he likes to talk , and I 'd as lief not have him think there 's anything to be kept quiet . " Freed nodded again and went away . Fifteen minutes later he returned.  | " She arrived last Tuesday , registering from New York . She had n't a trunk , only some bags . There were no phone-calls charged to her room , and she does n't , seem to have received much , if any , mail . The only one anybody remembers having seen her with was a tall dark man of thirty-six or so . She went out at half-past nine this morning , came back an hour later , paid her bill , and had her bags carried out to a car . The boy who carried them says it was a Nash touring car , probably a hired one . She left a forwarding address  --  the Ambassador , Los Angeles . " Spade said , " Thanks a lot , Freed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his office Effie Perine stopped typing a letter to tell him : " Your friend Dundy was in . He wanted to look at your guns . " " And ? " " I told him to come back when you were here . " " Good girl . If he comes back again let him look at them . " " And Miss Wonderly called up . " " It 's about time . What did she say ? " " She wants to see you . " The girl picked up a slip of paper from her desk and read the memorandum penciledon it : " She 's at the Coronet , on California Street , apartment one thousand and one . You 're to ask for Miss Leblanc . " Spade said , " Give me , " and held out his hand . When she had given him the memorandum he took out his lighter , snapped on the flame , set it to the slip of paper , held the paper until all but one corner was curling black ash , dropped it on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The girl watched him with disapproving eyes . He grinned at her , said , " That 's just the way it is , dear , " and went out again.  |p39MISS  WONDERLY , in a belted green crepe silk dress , opened the door of apartment 1001 at the Coronet . Her face was flushed . Her dark red hair , parted on the left side , swept back in loose waves over her right temple , was somewhat tousled . Spade took off his hat and said : " Good morning . " His smile brought a fainter smile to her face . Her yes , of blue that was almost violet , did not lose their troubled look . She lowered her head and said in a hushed , timid , voice : " Come in , Mr. Spade . " She led him past open kitchen- , bathroom- , and bedroom-doorsinto a cream and red living-room , apologizing for its confusion : " Everything is upside-down . I have n't even finished unpacking . " She laid his hat on a table and sat down on a walnutsettee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She looked at her fingers , working them together , and said : " Mr. Spade , I 've a terrible , terrible confession make . " Spade smiled a polite smile , which she did not lift her eyes to see , and said nothing . " That  --  that story I told you yesterday was all  --  a story , " she stammered , and looked up at him now with miserable frightened eyes .   " Oh , that , " Spade said lightly . " We did n't exactly believe your story . " " Then  --  ? " Perplexity was added to the misery and fright in her eyes . " We believed your two hundred dollars . " " You mean  --  ? " She seemed to not know what he meant . " I mean that you paid us more than if you 'd been telling the truth , " he explained blandly , " and enough more to make it all right . " Her eyes suddenly lighted up . She lifted herself a few inches from the settee , settled down again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eagerly : " And even now you 'd be willing to  --  ? " Spade stopped her with a palm-up motion of one hand . The upper part of his face frowned . The lower part smiled . " That depends , " he said . " The hell of it is , Miss Is your name Wonderly or Leblanc ? " She blushed and murmured : " It 's really O'Shaughnessy  --  BrigidO'Shaughnessy . " " The hell of it is , Miss O'Shaughnessy , that a couple of murders "  --  she winced  --  " coming together like this get everybody stirred up , make the police think they can go the limit , make everybody hard to handle and expensive . It 's not  --  " He stopped talking because she had stopped listening and was waiting for him to finish . " Mr. Spade , tell me the truth . " Her voice quivered on the verge of hysteria . Her face had become haggard around desperate eyes . " Am I to blame for  --  for last night ? " Spade shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " You warned us that Thursby was dangerous . Of course you lied to us about your sister and all , but that does n't count : we did n't believe you . " He shrugged his sloping shoulders . " I would n't say it was your fault . " She said , " Thank you , " very softly , and then moved her head from side to side . " But I 'll always blame myself . " She put a hand to her throat . " Mr. Archer was so  --  so alive yesterday afternoon , so solid and hearty and  --  " " Stop it , " Spade commanded . " He knew what he was doing . They 're the chances we take . " " Was  --  was he married ? " " Yes , with ten thousand insurance , no children , and a wife who did n't like him . " " Oh , please do n't ! " she whispered . Spade shrugged again . " That 's the way it was . " He glanced at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside her . " There 's no time for worrying about that now . " His voice was pleasant but firm . " Out there a flock of policemen and assistant district attorneys and reporters are running around with their noses to the ground . What do you want to do ? " " I want you to save me from  --  from it all , " she repliedin a thin tremulous voice . She put a timid hand on his sleeve . " Mr. Spade , do they know about me ? " " Not yet . I wanted to see you first . " " What  --  what would , they think if they knew about the way I came to you  --  with those lies ? " " It would make them suspicious . That 's why I 've been stalling them till I could see you . I thought maybe we would n't have to let them know all of it . We ought to be able to fake a story that will rock them to sleep , if necessary . " " You do n't think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  do you ? " Spade grinned at her and said : " I forgot to ask you that . Did you ? " " No . " " ' That 's good . Now what are we going to tell the police ? " She squirmed on her end of the settee and her eyes wavered between heavy lashes , as if trying and failing to free their gaze from his . She seemed smaller , and very young and oppressed . " Must they know about me at all ? " she asked . " I think I 'd rather die than that , Mr. Spade . I ca n't explainnow , but ca n't you somehow manage so that you can shield me from them , so I wo n't have to answer their questions ? I do n't think I could stand being questioned now . I think I would rather die . Ca n't you , Mr. Spade ? " " Maybe , " he said , " but I 'll have to know what it 's all about . " She went down on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . Her face was wan , taut , and fearfulover tight-clasped hands . " I have n't lived a good life , " she cried . " I 've been bad  --  worse than you could know  --  but I 'm not all bad . Look at me , Mr. Spade . You know I 'm not all bad , do n't you ? You can see that , ca n't you ? Then ca n't you trust me a little ? Oh , I 'm so alone and afraid , and I 've got nobody to help me if you wo n't help me . I know I 've no right to ask you to trust me if I won'tP43trust you . I do trust you , but I ca n't tell you . I ca n't tell you now . Later I will , when I can . I 'm afraid , Mr. Spade . I 'm afraid of trusting you . I do n't mean that . I do trust you , but  --  I trusted Floyd and  --  I 've nobody else , nobody else , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you can help me . If I had n't believed you could save me I would have run away today instead of sending for you . If I thought anybody else could save me would I be down on my knees like this ? I know this is n't fair of me . But be generous , Mr. Spade , do n't ask me to be fair . You 're strong , you 're resourceful , you 're brave . You can spare me some of that strength and resourcefulnessand courage , surely . Help me , Mr. Spade . Help me because I need help so badly , and because if you do n't where will I find anyone who can , no matter how willing ? Help me . I 've no right to ask you to help me blindly , but I do ask you . Be generous , Mr. Spade . You can help me . Help me . " Spade , who had held his breath through much of this speech , now emptied his lungs with a long sighing exhalation between pursed lips and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's help . You 're good . You 're very good . It 's chiefly your eyes , I think , and that throb you get into your voice when you say things like Be generous , Mr. Spade . ' " She jumped up on her feet . Her face crimsoned painfully , but she held her head erect and she looked Spade straight in the eyes . " I deserve that , " she said . " I deserve it , but  --  oh !  - -  I did want your help so much . I do want it , and need i t , so much . And the lie was in the way I said it , and not at all in what I said . " She turned away , no longer holding herself erect . " It is my own fault that you ca n't believe me now . " Spade 's face reddened and he looked down at the floor , muttering : " Now you are dangerous . " Brigid O'Shaughnessy went to the table and picked up his hat . She came back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . offering it to him , but holding it for him to take if he wished . Her face was white and thin . Spade looked at his hat and asked : " What happened last night ? " " Floyd came to the hotel at nine o'clock , and we went out for a walk . I suggested that so Mr. Archer could see him . We stopped at a restaurant in Geary Street , I think it was , for supper and to dance , and came back to the hotel at about half-past twelve . Floyd left me at the door and I stood inside and watched Mr. Archer fol. low him down the street , on the other side . " " Down ? You mean towards Market Street ? " " Yes . " " Do you know what they 'd be doing in the neighborhoodof Bush and Stockton , where Archer was shot ? " " Is n't that near where Floyd lived ? " " No . It would be nearly a dozen blocks out of his way if he was going from your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after they had gone ? " " I went to bed . And this morning when I went out for breakfast I saw the headlines in the papers and read about  --  you know . Then I went up to Union Square , where I had seen automobiles for hire , and got one and went to the hotel for my luggage . After I found myip45room had been searched yesterday I knew I would have to move , and I had found this place yesterday afternoon . So I came up here and then telephoned your office . " " Your room at the St. Mark was searched ? " he asked . " Yes , while I was at your office . " She bit her lip . " 1 did n't mean to tell you that . " " That means I 'm not supposed to question you about it ? " She nodded shyly . He frowned . She moved his hat a little in her hands . He laughed impatiently and said : " Stop waving the hat in my face . Have n't I offered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , returned the hat to the table , and sat beside him on the settee again . He said : " I 've got nothing against trusting you blindly except that I wo n't be able to do you much good if I have n't some idea of what it 's all about . For instance , I 've got to have some sort of a line on your Floyd Thursby . " " I met him in the Orient . " She spoke slowly , looking down at a pointed finger tracing eights on the settee between them . " We came here from Hongkong last week . He was  --  he had promised to help me . He took advantage of my helplessness and dependence on him to betray me . " " Betray you how ? " She shook her head and said nothing . Spade , frowning with impatience , asked : " Why did you want him shadowed ? "   " I wanted to learn how far he had gone . He would n't even let me know where he was staying . I wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was meeting , things like that . " " Did he kill Archer ? " She looked up at him , surprised . " Yes , certainly , " she said . " He had a Luger in a shoulder-holster . Archer was n't shot with a Luger . " " He had a revolver in his overcoat-pocket , " she said . " You saw it ? " " Oh , I 've seen it often . I know he always carries one there . I did n't see it last night , but I know he never wears an overcoat without it . " " Why all the guns ? " " He lived by them . There was a story in Hongkong that he had come out there , to the Orient , as bodyguard to a gambler who had had to leave the States , and that the gambler had since disappeared . They said Floyd knew about his disappearing . I do n't know . I do know that he always went heavily armed and that he never went to sleep without covering the floor around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his room . " " You picked a nice sort of playmate . " " Only that sort could have helped me , " she said simply , " if he had been loyal . " " Yes , if . " Spade pinched his lower lip between finger and thumb and looked gloomily at her . The vertical creases over his nose deepened , drawing his brows together . " How bad a hole are you actually in ? " " As bad , " she said , " as could be . "   " Physical danger ? " " I 'm not heroic . I do n't think there 's anything worse than death . " " Then it 's that ? " " It 's that as surely as we 're sitting here "  --  she shivered  --  " unless you help me . " He took his fingers away from his mouth and ran them through his hair . " I 'm not Christ , " he said irritably . " I ca n't work miracles out of thin air . " He looked at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving me nothing to work with . Who killed Thursby ? " She put a crumpled handkerchief to her mouth and said , " I do n't know , " through it . " Your enemies or his ? " " I do n't know . His , I hope , but I 'm afraid  --  I do n't know . " " How was he supposed to be helping you ? Why did you bring him here from Hongkong ? " She looked at him with frightened eyes and shook her head in silence . Her face was haggard and pitifully stubborn . Spade stood up , thrust his hands into the pockets of his jacket , and scowled down at her . " This is hopeless , " he said savagely . " I ca n't do anything for you . I do n't know what you want done . I do n't even know if you know what you want . " She hung her head and wept . He made a growling animal noise in his throat and went to the table for his hat . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choked voice , not looking up , " go to the police ? " " Go to them ! " he exclaimed , his voice loud with rage.  | " They 've been running me ragged since four o'clock this morning . I 've made myself God knows how much trouble standing them off . For what ? For some crazy notion that I could help you . I ca n't . I wo n't try . " He put his hat on his head and pulled it down tight . " Go to them ? All I 've got to do is stand still and they 'll be swarming all over me . Well , I 'll tell them what I know and you 'll have to take your chances . " She rose from the settee and held herself straight in front of him though her knees were trembling , and she held her white panic-stricken face up high though she could n't hold the twitching muscles of mouth and chin still . She said : " You 've been patient . You 've tried to help me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " She stretched out her right hand . " I thank you for what you have done . I  --  I ' 11 have to take my chances . " Spade made the growling animal noise in his throat again and sat down on the settee . " How much money have you got ? " he asked . The question startled her . Then she pinched her lower lip between her teeth and answered reluctantly : " I 've about five hundred dollars left . " " Give it to me . " She hesitated , looking timidly at him . He made angry gestures with mouth , eyebrows , hands , and shoulders . She went into her bedroom , returning almost immediately with a sheaf of paper money in one hand . He took the money from her , counted it , and said : " There 's only four hundred here . " " I had to keep some to live on , " she explained meekly , putting a hand to her breast . " Ca n't you get any more ? "  | " No . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on , " Ile insisted . " I 've some rings , a little jewelry . " " You 'll have to hock them , " he said , and held out his hand . " The Remedial 's the best place  --  Mission and Fifth . " She looked pleadingly at him . His yellow-grey eyes were hard and implacable . Slowly she put her hand inside the neck of her dress , brought out a slender roll o o f bills , and put them in his waiting hand . He smoothed the bills out and counted them  --  four twenties , four tens , and a five . He returned two of the lens and the five to her . The others he put in his pocket . Then he stood up and said : " I 'm going out and see what I can do for you . I 'll be back as soon as I can with the best news I can manage . I 'll ring four times  --  long , short , long , short  --  so you 'll know it 's me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can let myself out . " He left her standing in the center of the floor looking after him with dazed blue eyes . Spade went into a reception-room whose door bore the legend Wise , Merican c- Wise . The red-haired girl at the switchboard said : " Oh , hello , Mr. Spade . " " Hello , darling , " he replied . " Is Sid in ? " He stood beside her with a hand on her plump shoulder while she manipulated a plug and spoke into the mouthpiece : " Mr. Spade to see you , Mr. Wise . " She looked up at Spade . " Go right in . " He squeezed her shoulder by way of acknowledgment , crossed the reception-room to a dully lighted in- ner corridor , and passed down the corridor to a frosted glass door at its far end . He opened the frosted glass door and went into an office where a small olive-skinned man with a tired oval face under thin dark hair dotted with dandruff sat behind an immense desk on which bales of paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Spade and said : " Pull a chair around . So Miles got the big one last night ? " Neither his tired face nor his rather shrill voice held any emotion . " Uh-huh , that 's what I came in about . " Spade frowned and cleared his throat . " I think I 'm going to have to tell a coroner to go to hell , Sid . Can I hide behind the sanctity of my clients ' secrets and identities 1 and what-not , all the same priest or lawyer ? " Sid Wise lifted his shoulders and lowered the ends of his mouth . " Why not ? An inquest is not a courttrial . You can try , anyway . You 've gotten away with more than that before this . " " I know , but Dundy 's getting snotty , and maybe it is a little bit thick this time . Get your hat , Sid , and we 'll go see the right people . I want to be safe . " Sid Wise looked at the papers massed on his desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and went to the closet by the window . " You 're a son of a gun , Sammy , " he said as he took his hat from its hook . Spade returned to his office at ten minutes past five that evening . Effie Perine was sitting at his desk readingTime . Spade sat on the desk and asked : " Anything stirring ? "   " Not here . You look like you 'd swallowed the ca-nary . " He grinned contentedly . " I think we 've got a future . I always had an idea that if Miles would go off and die somewhere we 'd stand a better chance of thriving . Will you take care of sending flowers for me ? " " I did . " " You 're an invaluable angel . How 's your woman 's intuition today ? " " Why ? " " What do you think of Wonderly ? " " I 'm for her , " the girl replied without hesitation . " She 's got too many names , " Spade mused , " Wonderly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I do n't care if she 's got all the names in the phonebook . That girl is all right , and you know it . " " I wonder . " Spade blinked sleepily at Effie Perine . He chuckled . " Anyway she 's given up seven hundred smacks in two days , and that 's all right . " Effie Perine sat up straight and said : " Sam , if that girl 's in trouble and you let her down , or take advantage of it to bleed her , I 'll never forgive you , never have any respect for you , as long as I live . " Spade smiled unnaturally . Then he frowned . The frown was unnatural . He opened his mouth to speak , but the sound of someone 's entrance through the corridor-door stopped him . Effie Perine rose and went into the outer office . Spade Look off his hat and sat in his chair . The girl returned with an engraved card  --  Mr. Joel Cairo.  | " This guy is queer , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Spade . Mr Joel Cairo was a small-boned dark man of mediumheight . His hair was black and smooth and very glossy . His features were Levantine . A square-cut ruby , its sides paralleled by four baguette diamonds , gleamed against the deep green of his cravat . His black coat , cut tight to narrow shoulders , flared a little over slightly plump hips . His trousers fitted his round legs more snugly than was the current fashion . The uppers of his patent-leather shoes were hidden by fawn spats . He held a black derby hat in a chamois-gloved hand and came towards Spade with short , mincing , bobbing steps . The fragrance of chypre came with him . Spade inclined his head at his visitor and then at a chair , saying : " Sit down , Mr. Cairo . " Cairo bowed elaborately over his hat , said , " I thank you , " in a high-pitched thin voice and sat down . He sat down primly , crossing his ankles , placing his hat on his knees , and began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chair and asked : " Now what can I do for you , Mr. Cairo ? " The amiable negligenceof his tone , his motion in the chair , were precisely as they had been when he had addressed the same question to Brigid O'Shaughnessy on the previous day . Cairo turned his hat over , dropping his gloves into it , and placed it bottom-up on the corner of the desk nearest him . Diamonds twinkled on the second and fourth fingers of his left hand , a ruby that matched the one in his tie even to the surrounding diamondsP53on the third finger of his right hand . His hands were soft and well cared for . Though they were not large their flaccid bluntness made them seem clumsy . He rubbed his palms together and said over the whispering sound they made : " May a stranger offer condolences for your partner 's unfortunate death ? " " Thanks . " " May I ask , Mr. Spade , if there was , as the newspapersinferred , a certain  --  ah  --  relationship between that unfortunate happening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Spade said nothing in a blank-faced definite way . Cairo rose and bowed . " I beg your pardon . " He sat down and placed his hands side by side , palms down , on the corner of the desk . " More than idle curiosity made me ask that , Mr. Spade . I am trying to recover an  --  ah  --  ornament that has been  --  shall we say ?  --  mislaid . I thought , and hoped , you could assist me . " Spade nodded with eyebrows lifted to indicate attentiveness . " The ornament is a statuette , " Cairo went on , selectingand mouthing his words carefully , " the black figure of a bird . " Spade nodded again , with courteous interest . " I am prepared to pay , on behalf of the figure 's rightful owner , the sum of five thousand dollars for its recovery . " Cairo raised one hand from the desk-corner and touched a spot in the air with the broad-nailed tip of an ugly forefinger . " I am prepared to promise that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be asked . " He put his hand on the desk again beside the other and smiled blandly over them at the private detective .   " Five thousand is a lot of money , " Spade commented , looking thoughtfully at Cairo . " It  --  " Fingers drummed lightly on the door . When Spade had called , " Come in , " the door opened far enough to admit Effie Perine 's head and shoulders . She had put on a small dark felt hat and a dark coat with a grey fur collar . " Is there anything else ? " she asked . " No . Good night . Lock the door when you go , will you ? " " Good night , " she said and disappeared behind the closing door . Spade turned in his chair to face Cairo again , saying : " It 's an interesting figure . " The sound of the corridor-door 's closing behind Effie Perine came to them . Cairo smiled and took a short compact flat black pistolout of an inner pocket . " You will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at the back of your neck . " P55PAVE , did not look at the pistol . He raised his arms Sand , leaning back in his chair , intertwined the fingers of his two hands behind his head . His eyes , holdingno particular expression , remained focused on Cairo 's dark face . Cairo coughed a little apologetic cough and smiled nervously with lips that had lost some of their redness . His dark eyes were humid and bashful and very earnest . " I intend to search your offices , Mr. Spade . I warn you ! hat if you attempt to prevent me I shall certainly , hoot you . " " Go ahead . " Spade 's voice was as empty of expression as his face . " You will please stand , " the man with the pistol instructedhim at whose thick chest the pistol was aimed , " I shall have to make sure that you are not armed . " Spade stood up pushing his chair back with his calves as he straightened his legs . Cairo went around behind him . He transferred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He lifted Spade 's coat-tail and looked under it . Holding the pistol close I o Spade 's back , he put his right hand around Spade 's side and patted his chest . The Levantine face was then no more than six inches below and behind Spade 's right elbow .  | Spade 's elbow dropped as Spade spun to the right . Cairo 's face jerked back not far enough : Spade 's right heel on the patent-leathered toes anchored the smaller man in the elbow 's path . The elbow struck him beneath the cheek-bone , staggering him so that he must have fallen had he not been held by Spade 's foot on his foot . Spade 's elbow went on past the astonished dark face and straightened when Spade 's hand struck down at the pistol . Cairo let the pistol go the instant that Spade 's fingers touched it . The pistol was small in Spade 's hand . Spade took his foot off Cairo 's to complete his aboutface . With his left hand Spade gathered together the smaller man 's coat-lapels  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his right hand stowed the captured weapon away in a coat-pocket . Spade 's yellow-grey eyes were somber . His face was wooden , with a trace of sullenness around the mouth . Cairo 's face was twisted by pain and chagrin . There were tears in his dark eyes . His skin was the complexion of polished lead except where the elbow had reddened his cheek . Spade by means of his grip on the Levantine 's lapels turned him slowly and pushed him back until he was standing close in front of the chair he had lately occupied . A puzzled look replaced the look of pain in the lead-colored face . Then Spade smiled . His smile was gentle , even dreamy . His right shoulder raised a few inches . His bent right arm was driven up by the shoulder'slift . Fist , wrist , forearm , crooked elbow , and upper arm seemed all one rigid piece , with only the limber shoulder giving them motion . The fist struck Cairo'sp57face , covering for a moment one side of his chin , a corner of his mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo shut his eyes and was unconscious . Spade lowered the limp body into the chair , where it lay with sprawled arms and legs , the head lolling back against the chair 's back , the mouth open . Spade emptied the unconscious man 's pockets one by one , working methodically , moving the lax body when necessary , making a pile of the pockets ' contents on the desk . When the last pocket had been turned out he returned to his own chair , rolled and lighted a cigarette , and began to examine his spoils . He examined them with grave unhurried thoroughness . There was a large wallet of dark soft leather . The wallet contained three hundred and sixty-five dollars in United States bills of several sizes ; three five-pound notes ; a much-vised Greek passport bearing Cairo 's name and portrait ; five folded sheets of pinkish onionskinpaper covered with what seemed to he Arabic writing ; a raggedly clipped newspaper-account of the finding of Archer 's and Thursby 's bodies ; a post-cardphotographof a dusky woman with bold cruel eyes and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with age and somewhat cracked along its folds ; a thin sheaf of Mr. Joel Cairo 's engraved cards ; and a 1 icket for an orchestra seat at the Geary Theatre that evening . Besides the wallet and its contents there were three gaily colored silk handkerchiefs fragrant of chypre ; a platinum Longines watch on a platinum and red gold chain , attached at the other end to a small pear-shaped pendant of some white metal ; a handful of United States , British , French , and Chinese coins ; a ring holdinghalf a dozen keys ; a silver and onyx fountain-pen ; a metal comb in a leatherette case ; a nail-file in a leatherettecase ; a small street-guide to San Francisco ; a Southern Pacific baggage-check ; a half-filled package of violet pastilles ; a Shanghai insurance-broker 's business-card ; and four sheets of Hotel Belvedere writing paper , on one of which was written in small precise lettersSamuel Spade 's name and the addresses of his office and his apartment . Having examined these articles carefully  --  he even opened the back of the watch-case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over and took the unconscious man 's wrist between finger and thumb , feeling his pulse . Then he dropped the wrist , settled back in his chair , and rolled and lighted another cigarette . His face while he smoked was , except for occasional slight and aimless movements of his lower lip , so still and reflectivethat it seemed stupid ; but when Cairo presently moaned and fluttered his eyelids Spade 's face became bland , and he put the beginning of a friendly smile into his eyes and mouth . Joel Cairo awakened slowly . His eyes opened first , but a full minute passed before they fixed their gaze on any definite part of the ceiling . Then he shut his mouth and swallowed , exhaling heavily through his nose afterward . He drew in one foot and turned a hand over on his thigh . Then he raised his head from the chairback , looked around the office in confusion , saw Spade , and sat up . He opened his mouth to speak , started ,  |p59cla|p|ped  a hand to his face where Spade 's fist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Cairo said through his teeth , painfully : " I could have shot you , Mr. Spade . " " You could have tried , " Spade conceded . " I did not try . " " I know . " " Then why did you strike me after I was disarmed ? " " Sorry , " Spade said , and grinned wolfishly , showing his jaw-teeth , " but imagine my embarrassment when I found that five-thousand-dollar offer was just hooey . " " You are mistaken , Mr. Spade . That was , and is , a genuine offer . " " What the hell ? " Spade 's surprise was genuine . " I am prepared to pay five thousand dollars for the figure 's return . " Cairo took his hand away from his bruised face and sat up prim and business-like again . " You have it ? " " No . " " If it is not here "  --  Cairo was very politely skeptical  --  " why should you have risked serious injury to preventmy searching for it ? " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me up ? " Spade flicked a finger at Cairo 's possessions on the desk . " You 've got my apartment-address . Been up t here yet ? " " Yes , Mr. Spade . I am ready to pay five thousand dollars for the figure 's return , but surely it is natural enough that I should try first to spare the owner that expense if possible . " " Who is he ? "  |p60Cairo  shook his head and smiled . " You will have to forgive my not answering that question . " " Will I ? " Spade leaned forward smiling with tight lips . " I 've got you by the neck , Cairo . You 've walked in and tied yourself up , plenty strong enough to suit the police , with last night 's killings . Well , now you 'll have to play with me or else . " Cairo 's smile was demure and not in any way alarmed . " I made somewhat extensive inquiries about you before taking any action , " he said , " and was assured @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to interfere with profitable business relations . " Spade shrugged . " Where are they ? " he asked . " I have offered you five thousand dollars for  --  " Spade thumped Cairo 's wallet with the backs of his fingers and said : " There 's nothing like five thousand dollars here . You 're betting your eyes . You could come in and say you 'd pay me a million for a purple elephant , but what in hell would that mean ? " " I see , I see , " Cairo said thoughtfully , screwing up his eyes . " You wish some assurance of my sincerity . " He brushed his red lower lip with a fingertip . " A retainer , would that serve ? " " It might . " Cairo put his hand out towards his wallet , hesitated , withdrew the hand , and said : " You will take , say , a hundreddollars ? " Spade picked up the wallet and took out a hundred dollars . Then he frowned , said , " Better make it two hundred @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Your first guess was that I had the bird , " Spadep61said in a crisp voice when he had put the two hundred dollars into his pocket and had dropped the wallet on the desk again . " There 's nothing in that . What 's your second ? " " That you know where it is , or , if not exactly that , that you know it is where you can get it . " Spade neither denied nor affirmed that : he seemed hardly to have heard it . He asked : " What sort of proof can you give me that your man is the owner ? " " Very little , unfortunately . There is this , though : nobody else can give you any authentic evidence of ownership at all . And if you know as much about the affair as I suppose , or I should not be here  --  you know that the means by which it was taken from him shows that his right to it was more valid than anyone else 's  --  certainly more valid than Thursby 's . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Excitement opened Cairo 's eyes and mouth , turnedHis face red , made his voice shrill . " He is not the owner ! " Spade said , " Oh , " mildly and ambiguously . " Is he here , in San Francisco , now ? " Cairo asked in IL less shrill , but still excited , voice . Spade blinked his eyes sleepily and suggested : " It might be better all around if we put our cards on the table . " Cairo recovered composure with a little jerk . " I do not think it would be better . " His voice was suave now . " I f you know more than I , I shall profit by your knowledge , and so will you to the extent of five thousand dollars . If you do not then I have made a mistake in coming to you , and to do as you suggest would be simply to make that mistake worse . "   Spade nodded indifferently and waved his hand at the articles on the desk , saying : " There 's your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them to his pockets : " It 's understood that you 're to pay my expenses while I 'm getting this black bird for you , and five thousand dollars when it 's done ? " " Yes , Mr. Spade ; that is , five thousand dollars less whatever moneys have been advanced to you  --  five thousandin all . " " Right . And it 's a legitimate proposition . " Spade 's face was solemn except for wrinkles at the corners of his eyes . " You 're not hiring me to do any murders or burglaries for you , but simply to get it back if possible in an honest and lawful way . " " If possible , " Cairo agreed . His face also was solemn except for the eyes . " And in any event with discretion . " He rose and picked up his hat . " I am at the Hotel Belvederewhen you wish to communicate with me  --  room six-thirty-five . I confidently expect the greatest mutual benefit from our association , Mr. Spade . " He hesitated . " May @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd forgotten it . " Spade took the pistol out of his coat-pocket and handed it to Cairo . Cairo pointed the pistol at Spade 's chest . " You will please keep your hands on the top of the desk , " Cairo said earnestly . " I intend to search your offices . " Spade said : " I 'll be damned . " Then he laughed in his throat and said : " All right . Go ahead . I wo n't stop you . "  | FOR half an hour after Joel Cairo had gone Spade at alone , still and frowning , at his desk . Then he said aloud in the tone of one dismissing a problem , " Well , they 're paying for it , " and took a bottle of Manhattan cocktail and a paper drinking-cup from a desk-drawer . He filled the cup two-thirds full , drank , returned the bottle to the drawer , tossed the cup into the wastebasket , put on his hat and overcoat , turned off the lights , and went down to the night-lit street @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grey cap and overcoat was standing idly on the corner below Spade 's building . Spade walked up Sutter Street to Kearny , where he entered a cigar-store to buy two sacks of Bull Durham . When he came out the youth was one of four people waiting for a street-car on the opposite corner . Spade ate dinner at Herbert 's Grill in Powell Street , When he left the Grill , at a quarter to eight , the youth was looking into a nearby haberdasher 's window . Spade went to the Hotel Belvedere , asking at the desk for Mr. Cairo . He was told that Cairo was not in . The youth sat in a chair in a far corner of the lobby . Spade went to the Geary Theatre , failed to see Cairo in the lobby , and posted himself on the curb in front , facing the theatre . The youth loitered with other loiterers before Marquard 's restaurant below . P64At ten minutes past eight Joel Cairo appeared , walkingup Geary Street with his little mincing bobbing steps . Apparently he did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed moiler , ately surprised for a moment , and then said : " Oh , yes , of course you saw the ticket . " " Uh-huh . I 've got something I want to show you . " Spade drew Cairo back towards the curb a little away from the other waiting theatre-goers . " The kid in the cap down by Marquard 's . " Cairo murmured , " I 'll see , " and looked at his watch . He looked up Geary Street . He looked at a theatre-sign in front of him on which George Arliss was shown costumedas Shylock , and then his dark eyes crawled sidewisein their sockets until they were looking at the kid in the cap , at his cool pale face with curling lashes hiding lowered eyes . " Who is he ? " Spade asked . Cairo smiled up at Spade . " I do not know him . " " He 's been tailing me around town . " Cairo wet his lower lip with his tongue and asked : " Do you think it was wise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How do I know ? " Spade replied . " Anyway , it 's done . " Cairo removed his hat and smoothed his hair with a gloved hand . He replaced his hat carefully on his head and said with every appearance of candor : " I give you my word I do not know him , Mr. Spade . I give you my word I have nothing to do with him . I have asked nobody'sassistance except yours , on my word of honor . " " Then he 's one of the others ? "  | " That may be . " " I just wanted to know , because if he gets to be a nuisance I may have to hurt him . " " Do as you think best . He is not a friend of mine . " " That 's good . There goes the curtain . Good night , " Spade said , and crossed the street to board a westbound street-car . The youth in the cap boarded the same car . Spade left the car at Hyde Street and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upset , but showed unmistakable signs of having been searched . When Spade had washed and had put on a fresh shirt and collar he went out again , walked up to Sutter Street , and boarded a westbound car . The youth boarded it also . Within half a dozen blocks of the Coronet Spade left the car and went into the vestibule of a tall brown apartment-building . He pressed three bell-buttons together . The street-door-lock buzzed . He entered , passed the elevator and stairs , went down a long yellow-walled corridor to the rear of the building , found a back door fastened by a Yale lock , and let himself out into a narrowcourt . The court led to a dark back street , up which Spade walked for two blocks . Then he crossed over to California Street and went to the Coronet . It was not quite half-past nine o'clock . The eagerness with which Brigid O'Shaughnessy welcomedSpade suggested that she had been not entirely certain of his coming . She had put on a satin gown of the blue shade called Artoise that season , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Artoise . The red and cream sitting-room had been brought to order and livened with flowers in squat pottery vases of black and silver . Three small rough-barked logs burned in the fireplace . Spade watched them burn while she put away his hat and coat . " Do you bring me good news ? " she asked when she came into the room again . Anxiety looked through her smile , and she held her breath . " We wo n't have to make anything public that has n't already been made public . " " The police wo n't have to know about me ? " " No . " She sighed happily and sat on the walnut settee . Her face relaxed and her body relaxed . She smiled up at him with admiring eyes . " However did you manage it ? " she asked more in wonder than in curiosity . " Most things in San Francisco can be bought , or taken . " " And you wo n't get into trouble ? Do sit down . " She made room for him on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of trouble , " said with not too much complacence . He stood beside the fireplace and looked at her with eyes that studied , weighed , judged her without pretensethat they were not studying , weighing , judging her . She flushed slightly under the frankness of his scrutiny , but she seemed more sure of herself than before , though a becoming shyness had not left her eyes . He stood there until it seemed plain that he meant toP67ignore her invitation to sit beside her , and then crossed to the settee . " You are n't , " he asked as he sat down , " exactly the sort of person you pretend to be , are you ? " " I 'm not sure I know what you mean , " she said in her hushed voice , looking at him with puzzled eyes . " Schoolgirl manner , " he explained , " stammering and blushing and all that . " She blushed and replied hurriedly , not looking at him : " I told you this afternoon that I 've been bad  --  worse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean , " he said . " You told me that this afternoon in the same words , same tone . It 's a speech you 've practiced . " After a moment in which she seemed confused almost to the point of tears she laughed and said : " Very well , then , Mr. Spade , I 'm not at all the sort of person I pretend to be . I 'm eighty years old , incredibly wicked , and an iron-molder by trade . But if it 's a pose it 's one I 've grown into , so you wo n't expect me to drop it entirely , will you ? " " Oh , it 's all right , " he assured her . " Only it would n't he all right if you were actually that innocent . We 'd never get anywhere . " " I wo n't be innocent , " she promised with a hand on her heart . " I saw Joel Cairo tonight , " he said in the manner of ( ) lie making polite conversation . Gaiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his profile , became frightened , then cautious . He had stretched his legs out and was looking at his crossed feet . His face did not indicate that he was thinking about anything . There was a long pause before she asked uneasily : " You  --  you know him ? " " I saw him tonight . " Spade did not look up and he maintained his light conversational tone . " He was going to see George Arliss . " " You mean you talked to him ? " " Only for a minute or two , till the curtain-bell rang . " 1She got up from the settee and went to the fireplace to poke the fire . She changed slightly the position of an ornament on the mantelpiece , crossed the room to get a box of cigarettes from a table in a corner , straightened a curtain , and returned to her seat . Her face now was smooth and unworried . Spade grinned sidewise at her and said : " You 're good . You 're very good . " Her face did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he say ? " " About what ? " She hesitated . " About me . " " Nothing . " Spade turned to hold his lighter under the end of her cigarette . His eyes were shiny in a wooden satan 's face . " Well , what did he say ? " she asked with half-playful petulance . " He offered me five thousand dollars for the black bird . " She started , her teeth tore the end of her cigarette , and her eyes , after a swift alarmed glance at Spade , turned away from him . " You 're not going to go around poking at the fireP69and straightening up the room again , are you ? " he asked lazily . She laughed a clear merry laugh , dropped the mangledcigarette into a tray , and looked at him with clear merry eyes . " I wo n't , " she promised . " And what did you say ? " " Five thousand dollars is a lot of money . " She smiled , but when , instead of smiling , he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and presently vanished . In its place came a hurt , bewildered look . " Surely you 're not really considering it , " she said . " Why not ? Five thousand dollars is a lot of money . " " But , Mr. Spade , you promised to help me . " Her hands were on his arm . " I trusted you . You can't --  " She broke off , took her hands from his sleeve and worked them together . Spade smiled gently into her troubled eyes . " Do n't let 's try to figure out how much you 've trusted me , " he said . " I promised to help you  --  sure  --  but you did n't say anything about any black birds . " " But you must 've known or  --  or you would n't have mentioned it to me . You do know now . You wo n't  --  you ca n't  --  treat me like that . " Her eyes were cobalt-blue prayers . " Five thousand dollars is , " he said for the third time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders and hands and let them fall in a gesture that accepted defeat . " It is , " she agreed in a small dull voice . " It is far more than4I could ever offer you , if I must bid for your loyalty . " Spade laughed . His laughter was brief and somewhat hitter . " That is good , " he said , " coming from you .   What have you given me besides money ? Have you given me any of your confidence ? any of the truth ? any help in helping you ? Have n't you tried to buy my loyalty with money and nothing else ? Well , if I 'm peddling it , why should n't I let it go to the highest bidder ? " " I 've given you all the money I have . " Tears glistenedin her white-ringed eyes . Her voice was hoarse , vibrant . " I 've thrown myself on your mercy , told you that without your help I 'm utterly lost . What else is there ? " She suddenly moved close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Can I buy you with my body ? " Their faces were few inches apart . Spade took her face between his hands and he kissed her mouth roughly and contemptuously . Then he sat back and said : " I 'll think it over . " His face was hard and furious . She sat still holding her numb face where his hands had left it . He stood up and said : " Christ ! there 's no sense to this . " He took two steps towards the fireplace and stopped , glowering at the burning logs , grinding his teeth together . She did not move . He turned to face her . The two vertical lines above his nose were deep clefts between red wales . " I do n't give a damn about your honesty , " he told her , trying to make himself speak calmly . " I do n't care what kind of tricks you 're up to , what your secrets are , but I 've got to have something to show that you know what you 're doing . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that it 's all for the best , and  --  " " Show me , " he ordered . " I 'm willing to help you . I'veP71done what I could so far . If necessary I 'll go ahead blindfolded , but I ca n't do it without more confidence in you than I 've got now . You 've got to convince me that you know what it 's all about , that you 're not simply fiddling around by guess and by God , hoping it 'll come out all right somehow in the end . " " Ca n't you trust me just a little longer ? " " How much is a little ? And what are you waiting for ? " She bit her lip and looked down . " I must talk to Joel Cairo , " she said almost inaudibly . " You can see him tonight , " Spade said , looking at his watch . " His show will be out soon . We can get him on the phone at his hotel . " She raised her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ca n't let him know where I am . I 'm afraid . " " My place , " Spade suggested . She hesitated , working her lips together , then asked " Do you think he 'd go there ? " Spade nodded . " All right , " she exclaimed , jumping up , her eyes large and bright . " Shall we go now ? " She went into the next room . Spade went to the table in the corner and silently pulled the drawer out . The drawer held two packs of playing-cards , a pad of scorecardsfor bridge , a brass screw , a piece of red string , and a gold pencil . He had shut the drawer and was lighting a cigarette when she returned wearing a small dark hat and a grey kidskin coat , carrying his hat and coat . Their taxicab drew up behind a dark sedan that stood directly in front of Spade 's street-door . Iva Archer was alone in the sedan , sitting at the wheel . Spade lifted his hat to her and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside one of the benches and asked : " Do you mind waiting here a moment ? I wo n't be long . " " That 's perfectly all right , " Brigid O'Shaughnessy said , sitting down . " You need n't hurry . " Spade went out to the sedan . When he had opened the sedan 's door Iva spoke quickly : " I 've got to talk to you , Sam . Ca n't I come in ? " Her face was pale and nervous . " Not now . " Iva clicked her teeth together and asked sharply : " Who is she ? " " I 've only a minute , Iva , " Spade said patiently . " What is it ? " " Who is she ? " she repeated , nodding at the streetdoor . He looked away from her , down the street . In front of a garage on the next corner an undersized youth of twenty or twenty-one in neat grey cap and overcoat loafed with his back against a wall . Spade frowned and returned his gaze to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " he asked . " Has anything happened ? You ought n't to be here at this time of night . " " I 'm beginning to believe that , " she complained . " You told me I ought n't to come to the office , and now I ought n't to come here . Do you mean I ought n't to chase after you ? If that 's what you mean why do n't you say it right out ? " " Now , Iva , you 've got no right to take that attitude . " " I know I have n't . I have n't any rights at all , itp73seems , where you 're concerned . I thought I did . I thought your pretending to love me gave me  --  " Spade said wearily : " This is no time to be arguing about that , precious . What was it you wanted to see me about ? " " I ca n't talk to you here , Sam . Ca n't I come in ? " " Not now . " " Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a thin line of her mouth , squirmed around straight behind the wheel , and started the sedan 's engine , staring angrily ahead . When the sedan began to move Spade said , " Good night , Iva , " shut the door , and stood at the curb with his hat in his hand until it had been driven away . Then he went indoors again . Brigid O'Shauglmessy rose smiling cheerfully from the bench and they went up to his apartment . P74N HIS bedroom that was a living-room now the wallbed was up , Spade took Brigid O'Shaughnessy 's hat and coat , made her comfortable in a padded rocking chair , and telephoned the Hotel Belvedere . Cairo had not returned from the theatre . Spade left his telephonenumberwith the request that Cairo call him as soon as he came in . Spade sat down in the armchair beside the table and without any preliminary , without an introductory remarkof any sort , began to tell the girl about a thing that had happened some years before in the Northwest . He talked in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though now and then he repeated a sentence slightly rearranged , as if it were important that each detail be related exactly as it had happened . At the beginning Brigid O'Shaughnessy listened with only partial attentiveness , obviously more surprised by his telling the story than interested in it , her curiosity more engaged with his purpose in telling the story than with the story he told ; but presently , as the story went on , it caught her more and more fully and she became still and receptive . A man named Flitcraft had left his real-estate-office , in Tacoma , to go to luncheon one day and had neverp75returned . He did not keep an engagement to play golf after four that afternoon , though he had taken the initiative in making the engagement less than half an hour before he went out to luncheon . His wife and childrennever saw him again . His wife and he were supposedto be on the best of terms . He had two children , boys , one five and the other three . He owned his house in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest of the appurtenances of successful American living . Flitcraft had inherited seventy thousand dollars from his father , and , with his success in real estate , was worth something in the neighborhood of two hundred thousand dollars at the time he vanished . His affairs were in order , though there were enough loose ends to indicatethat he had not been setting them in order preparatory to vanishing . A deal that would have brought him an attractive profit , for instance , was to have been concluded the day after the one on which he disappeared . There was nothing to suggest that he had more than fifty or sixty dollars in his immediate possession at the time of his going . His habits for months past could be accounted for too thoroughly to justify any suspicion of secret vices , or even of another woman in his life , though either was barely possible . " He went like that , " Spade said , " like a fist when you open your hand . " When he had reached this point in his story the telephone-bellrang . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Cairo ? . . . This is Spade . Can you come up to my place  --  Post Street  --  now ? . . . Yes , I think it is . " He looked at the girl , pursed his lips , and then said rapidly :  | " Miss O'Shaughnessy is here and wants to see you . " Brigid O'Shaughnessy frowned and stirred in her chair , but did not say anything . Spade put the telephone down and told her : " He 'll be up in a few minutes . Well , that was in 1922 . In 1927 I was with one of the big detective agencies in Seattle . Mrs. Flitcraft came in and told us somebody had seen a man in Spokane who looked a lot like her husband . I went over there . It was Flitcraft , all right . He had been living in Spokane for a couple of years as Charles  --  that was his first name  --  Pierce . He had an automobile-business that was netting him twenty or twenty-five thousand a year , a wife , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suburb , and usually got away to play golf after four in the afternoon during the season . " Spade had not been told very definitely what to do when he found Flitcraft . They talked in Spade 's room at the Davenport . Flitcraft had no feeling of guilt . He had left his first family well provided for , and what he had done seemed to him perfectly reasonable . The only thing that bothered him was a doubt that he could make that reasonableness clear to Spade . He had never told anybody his story before , and thus had not had to attempt to make its reasonableness explicit . He tried now . " I got it all right , " Spade told Brigid O'Shaughnessy , " but Mrs. Flitcraft never did . She thought it was silly . Maybe it was . Anyway , it came out all right . She did n't want any scandal , and , after the trick he had played on her  --  the way she looked at it  --  she didn't ' 7want him . So they were divorced on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around . " Here 's what had happened to him . Going ti lunch lie passed an office-building that was being put up  --  just the skeleton . A beam or something fell eight or ten stories down and smacked the sidewalk alongside him . It brushed pretty close to him , but did n't touch him , though a piece of the sidewalk was chipped off and flew up and hit his cheek . It only took a piece of skin off , but he still had the scar when I saw him . He rubbed it with his finger  --  well , affectionately  --  when he told me about it . He was scared stiff of course , he said , but he was more shocked than really frightened . He felt like somebody had taken the lid off life and let him look at t Ile works . " Flitcraft had been a good citizen and a good husband and father , not , by any outer compulsion , but simply because he was a man who was most comfortable iii step with his surroundings . He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . The life he knew was a clean orderly sane responsible affair . Now a falling beam had shown him that life was fundamen-t ally none of these things . He , the good citizen-husbandfather , could be wiped out between office and restaurant by the accident of a falling beam . He knew then that omen died at haphazard like that , and lived only while blind chance spared them . It was not , primarily , the injustice of it that dis-c urbed him : he accepted that after the first shock . What disturbed him was the discovery that in sensibly orderinghis affairs he had got out of step , and not into step ,  | with life . He said he knew before he had gone twenty feet from the fallen beam that he would never know peace again until he had adjusted himself to this new glimpse of life . By the time he had eaten his luncheonhe had found his means of adjustment . Life could be ended for him at random by a falling beam : he would change his life at random @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , as much as he supposed was usual , but he knew he was leaving them adequately provided for , and his love for them was not of the sort that would make absence painful . " He went to Seattle that afternoon , " Spade said , " and from there by boat to San Francisco . For a couple of years he wandered around and then drifted back to the Northwest , and settled in Spokane and got married . His second wife did n't look like the first , but they were more alike than they were different . You know , the kindof women that play fair games of golf and bridge and like new salad-recipes . He was n't sorry for what he had ' done . It seemed reasonable enough to him . I do n't think he even knew he had settled back naturally into the same groove he had jumped out of in Tacoma . But that 's the part of it I always liked . He adjusted himself to beams falling , and then no more of them fell , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " How perfectly fascinating , " Brigid O'Shaughnessy said . She left her chair and stood in front of him , close . Her eyes were wide and deep . " I do n't have to tell you how utterly at a disadvantage you 'll have me , with him here , if you choose . " Spade smiled slightly without separating his lips . " No , you do n't have to tell me , " he agreed.  | " And you know I 'd never have placed myself in thisposition if I had n't trusted you completely . " Her thumband forefinger twisted a black button on his blue coat . Spade said , " That again ! " with mock resignation . " But you know it 's so , " she insisted . " No , I do n't know it . " He patted the hand that was twisting the button . " My asking for reasons why I should trust you brought us here . Do n't let 's confuse things . You do n't have to trust me , anyhow , as long as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studied his face . Her nostrils quivered . Spade laughed . He patted her hand again and said : " Do n't worry about that now . He 'll be here in a moment . Get your business with him over , and then we 'll see how we 'll stand . " " And you 'll let me go about it  --  with him  --  in my own way ? " " Sure . " She turned her hand under his so that her fingers pressed his . She said softly : " You 're a God-send . " Spade said : " Do n't overdo it . " She looked reproachfully at him , though smiling , and returned to the padded rocker . Joel Cairo was excited . His dark eyes seemed all irises and his high-pitched thin-voiced words were tumblingout before Spade had the door half-open . " That boy is out there watching the house , Mr. Spade , that boy you showed me , or to whom you showed me , in front of the theatre . What am I to understand from that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with no thought of tricks or traps . "   " You were asked in good faith . " Spade frowned thoughtfully . " But I ought to 've guessed he might show up . He saw you come in ? " " Naturally . I could have gone on , but that seemed useless , since you had already let him see us together . " Brigid O'Shaughnessy came into the passageway behindSpade and asked anxiously : " What boy ? What is it ? " Cairo removed his black hat from his head , bowed stiffly , and said in a prim voice : " If you do not know , ask Mr. Spade . I know nothing about it except through him . " " A kid who 's been trying to tail me around town all evening , " Spade said carelessly over his shoulder , not turning to face the girl . " Come on in , Cairo . There 's no use standing here talking for all the neighbors . " Brigid O'Shaughnessy grasped Spade 's arm above the elbow and demanded : " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I shook him before that . Then I suppose he came back here to try to pick me up again . " Cairo , holding his black hat to his belly with both hands , had come into the passageway . Spade shut the corridor-door behind him and they went into the livingroom . There Cairo bowed stiffly over his hat once more and said : " I am delighted to see you again , Miss O'Shaughnessy . " " I was sure you would be , Joe , " she replied , giving him her hand . He made a formal bow over her hand and released it quickly . She sat in the padded rocker she had occupied before.  |p81Cairo  sat in the armchair by the table . Spade , when he had hung Cairo 's hat and coat in the closet , sat on an end of the sofa in front of the windows and began to roll , 6 cigarette . Brigid O'Shaughnessy said to Cairo : " Sam told me about your offer for the falcon . How soon can you have the money ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It is ready . " He continued to smile at the girl for a little while after he had spoken , and then looked at Spade . Spade was lighting his cigarette . His face was tranquil . " In cash ? " the girl asked . " Oh , yes , " Cairo replied . She frowned , put her tongue between her lips , withdrewit , and asked : " You are ready to give us five thou sand dollars , now , if we give you the falcon ? " Cairo held up a wriggling hand . " Excuse me , " he said . " I expressed myself badly . I did not mean to say that I have the money in my pockets , but that I am prepared to get it on a very few minutes ' notice at any time during banking hours . " " Oh ! " She looked at Spade . Spade blew cigarette-smoke down the front of his vest and said : " That 's probably right . He had only a few hundred in his pockets when I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ round and wide he grinned . The Levantine bent forward in his chair . He failed to keep eagerness from showing in his eyes and voice . " I can be quite prepared to give you the money at , say , half-past ten in the morning . Eh ? "  | Brigid O'Shaughnessy smiled at him and said : " But I have n't got the falcon . " Cairo 's face was darkened by a flush of annoyance . He put an ugly hand on either arm of his chair , holding his small-boned body erect and stiff between them . His dark eyes were angry . He did not say anything . The girl made a mock-placatory face at him . " I 'll have it in a week at the most , though , " she said . " Where is it ? " Cairo used politeness of mien to expressskepticism . " Where Floyd hid it . " " Floyd ? Thursby ? " She nodded . " And you know where that is ? " he asked . " I think I do . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Perhaps not a whole week . Whom are you buying it for , Joe ? " Cairo raised his eyebrows . " I told Mr. Spade . For its owner . " Surprise illuminated the girl 's face . " So you went back to him ? " " Naturally I did . " She laughed softly in her throat and said : " I should have liked to have seen that . " Cairo shrugged . " That was the logical development . " He rubbed the back of one hand with the palm of the other . His upper lids came down to shade his eyes . " Why , if I in turn may ask a question , are you willing to sell to me ? " " I 'm afraid , " she said simply , " after what happened to Floyd . That 's why I have n't it now . I 'm afraid top83touch it except to turn it over to somebody else right away . " Spade , propped on an elbow on the sofa , looked at and listened to them impartially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the easy stillness of his features , there was no indication of either curiosity or impatience . " Exactly what , " Cairo asked in a low voice , " happened to Floyd ? " The tip of Brigid O'Shaughnessy 's right forefinger traced a swift G in the air . Cairo said , " I see , " but there was something doubting in his smile . " Is he here ? " " I do n't know . " She spoke impatiently . " What differencedoes it make ? " The doubt in Cairo 's smile deepened . " It might make a world of difference , " he said , and rearranged his hands in his lap so that , intentionally or not , a blunt forefingerpointed at Spade . The girl glanced at the pointing finger and made an impatient motion with her head . " Or me , " she said , " or you . " " Exactly , and shall we add more certainly the boy outside ? " " Yes , " she agreed and laughed . " Yes , unless he 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo 's face . In a shrill enragedvoice he cried : " The one you could n't make ? " Brigid O'Shaughnessy jumped up from her chair . Iler lower lip was between her teeth . Her eyes were ( lark and wide in a tense white face . She took two quick steps towards Cairo . He started to rise . Her right hand went out and cracked sharply against his cheek , leav- i ing the imprint of fingers there . Cairo grunted and slapped her cheek , staggering her sidewise , bringing from her mouth a brief muffled scream . Spade , wooden of face , was up from the sofa and close to them by then . He caught Cairo by the throat and shook him . Cairo gurgled and put a hand inside his coat . Spade grasped the Levantine 's wrist , wrenched it away from the coat , forced it straight out to the side , and twisted it until the clumsy flaccid fingers opened to let the black pistol fall down on the rug . Brigid O'Shaughnessy quickly picked up the pistol . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat , said : " This is the second time you 've put your hands on me . " His eyes , though the throttling pressure on his throat made them bulge , were cold and menacing . " Yes , " Spade growled . " And when you 're slapped you 'll take it and like it . " He released Cairo 's wrist and with a thick open hand struck the side of his face three times , savagely . Cairo tried to spit in Spade 's face , but the dryness of the Levantine 's mouth made it only an angry gesture . Spade slapped the mouth , cutting the lower lip . The door-bell rang . Cairo 's eyes jerked into focus on the passageway that led to the corridor-door . His eyes had become unangry and wary . The girl had gasped and turned to face the passageway . Her face was frightened . Spade stared gloomily for a moment at the blood trickling fromp85Cairo 's lip , and then stepped back , taking his hand from the Levantine 's throat . " Who is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade ; and Cairo 's eyes jerked back to ask the same question . Spade gave his answer irritably : " I do n't know . " The bell rang again , more insistently . " Well , keep quiet , " Spade said , and went out of the room , shutting the door behind him . Spade turned on the light in the passageway and opened the door to the corridor . Lieutenant Dundy and Tom Polhaus were there . " Hello , Sam , " Tom said . " We thought maybe you wouldn't 've gone to bed yet . " Dundy nodded , but said nothing . Spade said good-naturedly : " Hello . You guys pick swell hours to do your visiting ih . What is it this time ? " Dundy spoke then , quietly : " We want to talk to you , Spade . " " Well ? " Spade stood in the doorway , blocking it . " Go ahead and talk . " Tom Polhaus advanced saying : " We , do n't have to do it standing here , do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " You ca n't come in . " His tone was very slightly apologetic . Tom 's thick-featured face , even in height with Spade 's , took on an expression of friendly scorn , though there was a bright gleam in his small shrewd eyes . " What the hell , Sam ? " he protested and put a big hand playfullyon Spade 's chest.  | Spade leaned against the pushing hand , grinned wolf ishly , and asked . " Going to strong-arm me , Tom ? " Tom grumbled , " Aw , for God 's sake , " and took his hand away . Dundy clicked his teeth together and said through them : " Let us in . " Spade 's lip twitched over his eyetooth . He said : " You 're not coming in . What do you want to do about it ? Try to get in ? Or do your talking here ? Or go to hell ? " Tom groaned . Dundy , still speaking through his teeth , said : " It 'd pay you to play along with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with this and you 've got away with that , but you ca n't keep it up forever . " " Stop me when you can , " Spade replied arrogantly . " That 's what I 'll do . " Dundy put his hands behind him and thrust his hard face up towards the private detective 's . " There 's talk going around that you and Archer 's wife were cheating on him . " Spade laughed . " That sounds like something you thought up yourself . " " Then there 's not anything to it ? " " Not anything . " " The talk is , " Dundy said , " that she tried to get a divorce out of him so 's she could put in with you , but he would n't give it to her . Anything to that ? " " There 's even talk , " Dundy went on stolidly , " that that 's why he was put on the spot . " Spade seemed mildly amused . " Do n't be a hog , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a time on me . Your first idea that I knocked Thursby off because he 'd killed Miles falls apart if you blame me for killing Miles too . " " You have n't heard me say you killed anybody , " Dundy replied . " You 're the one that keeps bringing that up . But suppose I did . You could have blipped 1 hem both . There 's a way of figuring it . " " Uh-huh . I could 've butchered Miles to get his wife , and then Thursby so I could hang Miles 's killing on him . That 's a hell of a swell system , or will be when I can give somebody else the bump and hang Thursby 's on them . How long am I supposed to keep that up ? Are you going to put your hand on my shoulder for all the killings in San Francisco from now on ? " Tom said : " Aw , cut the comedy , Sam . You know damned well we do n't like this any more than you do , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hope you 've got something to do besides pop in here early every morning with a lot of damned fool questions . " " And get damned lying answers , " Dundy added deliberately . " Take it easy , " Spade cautioned him . Dundy looked him up and down and then looked him straight in the eyes . " If you say there was nothing between you and Archer 's wife , " he said , " you 're a liar , and I 'm telling you so . " A startled look came into Tom 's small eyes . Spade moistened his lips with the tip of his tongue and asked : " Is that the hot tip that brought you here at this ungodly time of night ? " " That 's one of them . "  | " And the others ? " Dundy pulled down the corners of his mouth . " Let us in . " He nodded significantly at the doorway in which Spade stood . Spade frowned and shook his head . Dundy 's mouth-corners lifted in a smile of grim satisfaction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he told TomeTom shifted his feet and , not looking at either man , mumbled : " God knows . " " What 's this ? " Spade asked . " Charades ? " " All right , Spade , we 're going . " Dundy buttoned his overcoat . " We 'll be in to see you now and then . Maybe you 're right in bucking us . Think it over . " " Uh-huh , " Spade said , grinning . " Glad to see you any time , Lieutenant , and whenever I 'm not busy I 'll let you in . " A voice in Spade 's living-room screamed : " Help ! Help ! Police ! Help ! " The voice , high and thin and shrill , was Joel Cairo 's . Lieutenant Dundy stopped turning away from the door , confronted Spade again , and said decisively : " I guess we 're going in . " The sounds of a brief struggle , of a blow , of a subduedcry , came to them . Spade 's face twisted into a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess you are , " and stood out of the way . When the police-detectives had entered he shut thecorridor-door and followed them back to the livingroom .   BRIGID O'SHAUGHNESSY was huddled in the armchair by the table . Her forearms were up over her cheeks , her knees drawn up until they hid the lower part of her face . Her eyes were white-circled and terrified . Joel Cairo stood in front of her , bending over her , holding in one hand the pistol Spade had twisted out of his hand . His other hand was clapped to his forehead . Blood ran through the fingers of that hand and down under them to his eyes . A smaller trickle from his cut lip made three wavy lines across his chin . Cairo did not heed the detectives . He was glaring at the girl huddled in front of him . His lips were working spasmodically , but no coherent sound came from between them . Dundy , the first of the three into the living-room , moved swiftly to Cairo 's side , put a hand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Levantine 's wrist , and growled : " What are you up to here ? " Cairo took the red-smeared hand from his head and flourished it close to the Lieutenant 's face . Uncovered by the hand , his forehead showed a three-inch ragged tear . " This is what she has done , " he cried . " Look at it . " The girl put her feet down on the floor and looked warily from Dundy , holding Cairo 's wrist , to Tom Pol- haus , standing a little behind them , to Spade , leaning against the door-frame . Spade 's face was placid . When his gaze met hers his yellow-grey eyes glinted for an instant with malicious humor and then became expressionlessagain . " Did you do that ? " Dundy asked the girl , nodding at Cairo 's cut head . She looked at Spade again . He did not in any way respond to the appeal in her eyes . He leaned against the door-frame and observed the occupants of the room with the polite detached air of a disinterested spectator @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her eyes were wide and dark and earnest . " I had to , " she said in a low throbbing voice . " I was all alone in here with him when he attacked me . I could n't  --  I tried to keep him off . I  --  I could n't make myself shoot him . " " Oh , you liar ! " Cairo cried , trying unsuccessfully to pull the arm that held his pistol out of Dundy 's grip . " Oh , you dirty filthy liar ! " He twisted himself around to face Dundy . " She 's lying awfully . I came here iii good faith and was attacked by both of them , and when you came he went out to talk to you , leaving her here with this pistol , and then she said they were going to kill me after you left , and I called for help , so you would n't leave me here to be murdered , and then she struck me with the pistol . " " Here , give me this thing , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cairo 's hand . " Now let 's get this straight . What 'd you come here for ? " " He sent for me . " Cairo twisted his head around toP91stare defiantly at Spade . " He called me up on the phone and asked me to come here . " Spade blinked sleepily at the Levantine and said nothing . Dundy asked : " What 'd he want you for ? " Cairo withheld his reply until he had mopped his bloody forehead and chin with a lavender-barred silk handkerchief . By then some of the indignation in his manner had been replaced by caution . " He said he wanted  --  they wanted  --  to see me . I did n't know what about . " Tom Polhaus lowered his head , sniffed the odor of chypre that the mopping handkerchief had released in the air , and turned his head to scowl interrogatively at Spade . Spade winked at him and went on rolling a cigarette . Dundy asked : " Well , what happened then ? " " Then they attacked me . She struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pistol out of my pocket . I do n't know what they would have done next if you had n't arrived at that moment . I dare say they would have murdered me then and there . When he went out to answer the bell he left her here with the pistol to watch over me . " Brigid O'Shaughnessy jumped out of the armchair crying , " Why do n't you make him tell the truth ? " and  --  lapped Cairo on the cheek . Cairo yelled inarticulately . Dundy pushed the girl back into the chair with the hand that was not holding the Levantine 's arm and growled : " None of that now . "   Spade , lighting his cigarette , grinned softly through smoke and told Tom : " She 's impulsive . " " Yeah , " Tom agreed . Dundy scowled down at the girl and asked : " What do you want us to think the truth is ? " " Not what he said , " she replied . " Not anything he said . " She turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know ? " Spade responded . " I was out in the kitchen mixing an omelette when it all happened , was n't I ? " She wrinkled her forehead , studying him with eyes that perplexity clouded . Tom grunted in disgust . Dundy , still scowling at the girl , ignored Spade 's speech and asked her : " If he 's not telling the truth , how come he did the squawking ' for help , and not you ? " " Oh , he was frightened to death when I struck him , " she replied , looking contemptuously at the Levantine . Cairo 's face flushed where it was not blood-smeared . He exclaimed : " Pfoo ! Another lie ! " She kicked his leg , the high heel of her blue slipperstriking him just below the knee . Dundy pulled himaway from her while big Tom came to stand close toher , rumbling : " Behave , sister . That 's no way to act . " " ' Then make him tell the truth , " she said defiantly . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Just do n't Fget rough . " Dundy , looking at Spade with green eyes hard and bright and satisfied , addressed his subordinate : " Well , Tom , I do n't guess we 'll go wrong pulling the lot of them in . " P93Tom nodded gloomily . Spade left the door and advanced to the center of the room , dropping his cigarette into a tray on the table as he passed it . His smile and manner were amiablycomposed . " Do n't be in a hurry , " he said . " Every-t king can be explained . " " I bet you , " Dundy agreed , sneering . Spade bowed to the girl . " Miss O'Shaughnessy , " he said , " may I present Lieutenant Dundy and DetectivesergeantPolhaus . " He bowed to Dundy . " Miss O'Shaughnessy is an operative in my employ . " Joel Cairo said indignantly : " That is n't so . She  --  " Spade interrupted him in a quite loud , but still genial , voice : " I hired her just recently , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  an acquaintance , at any rate  --  of Thursby 's . He came to me this afternoon and tried to hire me to find something Thursby was supposed to have on him when he was bumped off . It looked funny , t lie way he put it to me , so I would n't touch it . Then he pulled a gun  --  well , never mind that unless it comes to a point of laying charges against each other . Anyway , after talking it over with Miss O'Shaughnessy , I t thought maybe I could get something out of him about Miles 's and Thursby 's killings , so I asked him to come up here . Maybe we put the questions to him a little rough , but he was n't hurt any , not enough to have to cry for help . I 'd already had to take his gun away from him again . " As Spade talked anxiety came into Cairo 's reddened face . His eyes moved jerkily up and down , shifting their focus uneasily between the floor and Spade 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demanded : " Well , what 've you got to say to that ? " Cairo had nothing to say for nearly a minute while he stared at the Lieutenant 's chest . When he lifted his eyes they were shy and wary . " I do n't know what I should say , " he murmured . His embarrassment seemed genuine . " Try telling the facts , " Dundy suggested . " The facts ? " Cairo 's eyes fidgeted , though their gaze did not actually leave the Lieutenant 's . " What assurancehave I that the facts will be believed ? " " Quit stalling . All you 've got to do is swear to a complaint that they took a poke at you and the warrantclerkwill believe you enough to issue a warrant that 'll let us throw them in the can . " Spade spoke in an amused tone : " Go ahead , Cairo . Make him happy . Tell him you 'll do it , and then we 'll swear to one against you , and he 'll have the lot of us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , not into the eyes of anyone there . Dundy blew breath through his nose in a puff that was not quite a snort and said : " Get your hats . " Cairo 's eyes , holding worry and a question , met Spade 's mocking gaze . Spade winked at him and sat on the arm of the padded rocker . " Well , boys and girls , " he said , grinning at the Levantine and at the girl with nothing but delight in his voice and grin , " we put it over nicely . " Dundy 's hard square face darkened the least of shades . He repeated peremptorily : " Get your hats . " Spade turned his grin on the Lieutenant , squirmed into a more comfortable position on the chair-arm , andp96asked lazily : " Do n't you know when you 're being kid-ded ? " Tom Polhaus 's face became red and shiny . Dundy 's face , still darkening , was immobile except for lips moving stiffly to say : " No , but we 'll let that wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose and put his hands in his trousers-pockets . Ile stood erect so he might look that much farther down at the Lieutenant . His grin was a taunt and selfcertaintyspoke in every line of his posture . " I dare you to take us in , Dundy , " he said . " We 'll laugh at you in every newspaper in San Francisco . You do n't think any of us is going to swear to any complaints against the others , do you ? Wake up . You 've been kidded . When the bell rang I said to Miss O'Shaughnessy and Cairo : It 's those damned bulls again . They 're getting to be nuisances . Let 's play a joke on them . When you hear them going one of you scream , and then we 'll see how far we can string them along before they tumble . ' And  --  " Brigid O'Shaughnessy bent forward in her chair and began to laugh hysterically . Cairo started and smiled . There was no vitality in his smile , but he held it fixed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Cut it out , Sam . " Spade chuckled and said : " But that 's the way it was . We  --  " " And the cut on his head and mouth ? " Dundy asked scornfully . " Where 'd they come from ? " " Ask him , " Spade suggested . " Maybe he cut himselfshaving . " Cairo spoke quickly , before he could be questioned ,   and the muscles of his face quivered under the strain of holding his smile in place while he spoke . " I fell . We intended to be struggling for the pistol when you came in , but I fell . I tripped on the end of the rug and fell while we were pretending to struggle . " Dundy said : " Horse feathers . " Spade said : " That 's all right , Dundy , believe it or not . The point is that that 's our story and we 'll stick to it . The newspapers will print it whether they believe it or not , and it 'll be just as funny one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are you going to do about it ? It 's no crime to kid a copper , is it ? You have n't got anything on anybody here . Everything we told you was part of the joke . What are you going to do about it ? " Dundy put his back to Spade and gripped Cairo by the shoulders . " You ca n't get away with that , " he snarled , shaking the Levantine . " You belched for help and you 've got to take it . " " No , sir , " Cairo sputtered . " It was a joke . He said you were friends of his and would understand . " Spade laughed . Dundy pulled Cairo roughly around , holding him now by one wrist and the nape of his neck . " I 'll take you along for packing the gun , anyway , " he said . " And I 'll take the rest of you along to see who laughs at the joke . " Cairo 's alarmed eyes jerked sidewise to focus on Spade 's face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dundy . The gun was part of the plant . It 's one of mine . " He laughed . " Too bad it 's only a thirty-two , or maybe you could findP97it was the one Thursby and Miles were shot with . " Dundy released Cairo , spun on his heel , and his right fist clicked on Spade 's chin . Brigid O'Shaughnessy uttered a short cry . Spade 's smile flickered out at the instant of the impact , but returned immediately with a dreamy quality added . He steadied himself with a short backward step and his thick sloping shoulders writhed under his coat . Before his fist could come up Tom Polhaus had pushed himself between the two men , facing Spade , encumberingSpade 's arms with the closeness of his barrel-like belly and his own arms . " No , no , for Christ 's sake ! " Tom begged . After a long moment of motionlessness Spade 's musclesrelaxed . " Then get him out of here quick , " he said . his smile had gone away again , leaving his face @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade , keeping his arms on Spade 's arms , turned his head to look over his shoulder at Lieutenant Dundy . Tom 's small eyes were reproachful . Dundy 's fists were clenched in front of his body and his feet were planted firm and a little apart on the floor , but the truculence in his face was modified by thin rims of white showing between green irises and upper eyelids . " Get their names and addresses , " he ordered . Tom looked at Cairo , who said quickly : " Joel Cairo , Hotel Belvedere . " Spade spoke before Tom could question the girl . " You can always get in touch with Miss O'Shaughnessy through me. "  |p98Tom  looked at Dundy . Dundy growled : " Get her address . " Spade said : " Her address is in care of my office . " Dundy took a step forward , halting in front of the girl . " Where do you live ? " he asked . Spade addressed Tom : " Get him out of here . I 've had enough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard and glittering  --  and mumbled : " Take it easy , Sam . " He buttoned his coat and turned to Dundy , asking , in a voice that aped casualness , " Well , is that all ? " and taking a step towards the door . Dundy 's scowl failed to conceal indecision . Cairo moved suddenly towards the door , saying : " I 'm going too , if Mr. Spade will be kind enough to give me my hat and coat . " Spade asked : " What 's the hurry ? " Dundy said angrily : " It was all in fun , but just the same you 're afraid to be left here with them . " " Not at all , " the Levantine replied , fidgeting , looking at neither of them , " but it 's quite late and  --  and I 'm going . I 'll go out with you if you do n't mind . " Dundy put his lips together firmly and said nothing . A light was glinting in his green eyes . Spade went to the closet in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade 's face was blank . His voice held the same blankness when he stepped back from helping the Levantine into his coat and said to Tom : " Tell him to leave the gun . " Dundy took Cairo 's pistol from his overcoat-pocket and put it on the table . He went out first , with Cairo at his heels . Tom halted in front of Spade , muttering ,   " I hope to God you know what you 're doing , " got no response , sighed , and followed the others out . Spade went after them as far as the bend in the passageway , where he stood until Tom had closed the corridor-door .   SPADE returned to the living-room and sat on an end of the sofa , elbows on knees , cheeks in hands , looking at the floor and not at Brigid O'Shaughnessy smiling weakly at him from the armchair . His eyes were sultry . The creases between brows over his nose were deep . His nostrils moved in and out with his breathing . Brigid O'Shaughnessy , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her , stopped smiling and regarded him with growing uneasiness . Red rage came suddenly into his face and he began to talk in a harsh guttural voice . Holding his maddened face in his hands , glaring at the floor , he cursed Dundy for five minutes without break , cursed him obscenely , blasphemously , repetitiously , in a harsh guttural voice . Then he took his face out of his hands , looked at the girl , grinned sheepishly , and said : " Childish , huh ? I know , but , by God , I do hate being hit without hitting back . " He touched his chin with careful fingers . " Not that it was so much of a sock at that . " He laughed and lounged back on the sofa , crossing his legs . " A cheap enough price to pay for winning . " His brows came together in a fleeting scowl . ' Though I 'll remember it . " The girl , smiling again , left her chair and sat on the sofa beside him . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Do you always carry on so high-handed ? "  | " I let him hit me , did n't I ? " " Oh , yes , but a police official . " " It was n't that , " Spade explained . " It was that in losing his head and slugging me he overplayed his hand . 1 f I 'd mixed it with him then he couldn't 've backed down . He 'd 've had to go through with it , and we'd 've had to tell that goofy story at headquarters . " He stared thoughtfully at the girl , and asked : " What did you do to Cairo ? " " Nothing . " Her face became flushed . " I tried to frighten him into keeping still until they had gone and he either got too frightened or stubborn and yelled . " " And then you smacked him with the gun ? " " I had to . He attacked me . " " You do n't know what you 're doing . " Spade 's smile did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you : you 're fumbling along by guess and by God . " " I 'm sorry , " she said , face and voice soft with contrition , " Sam . " " Sure you are . " He took tobacco and papers from his pockets and began to make a cigarette . " Now you 've had your talk with Cairo . Now you can talk to me . " She put a fingertip to her mouth , staring across the room at nothing with widened eyes , and then , with narrowereyes , glanced quickly at Spade . He was engrossed in the making of his cigarette . " Oh , yes , " she began , " of Course  --  " She took the finger away from her mouth and smoothed her blue dress over her knees . She frowned at her knees . Spade licked his cigarette , sealed it , and asked , " Well ? " while he felt for his lighter . " But I did n't , " she said , pausing between words as 102 THE MALTESE FALCONp102if she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to finish talking to him . " She stopped frowning at her knees and looked at Spade with clear candid eyes . " We were interrupted almost before we had begun . " Spade lighted his cigarette and laughed his mouth empty of smoke . " Want me to phone him and ask him to come back ? " She shook her head , not smiling . Her eyes moved back and forth between her lids as she shook her head , maintainingtheir focus on Spade 's eyes . Her eyes were inquisitive . Spade put an arm across her back , cupping his hand over the smooth bare white shoulder farthest from him . She leaned back into the bend of his arm . He said : " Well , I 'm listening . " She twisted her head around to smile up at him with playful insolence , asking : " Do you need your arm there for that ? " " No . " He removed his hand from her shoulder and let his arm drop down behind her . " You 're altogether unpredictable , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm still listening . " " Look at the time ! " she exclaimed , wriggling a finger at the alarm-clock perched atop the book saying twofiftywith its clumsily shaped hands. " 17h-huh , it 's been a busy evening . " " I must go . " She rose from the sofa . " This is ter-rible . " Spade did not rise . He shook his head and said : " Not until you 've told me about it . " " But look at the time , " she protested , " and it would take hours to tell you . "  | " It 'll have to take them then . " " Am I a prisoner ? " she asked gaily . " Besides , there 's the kid outside . Maybe he has n't gone home to sleep yet . " Her gaiety vanished . " Do you think he 's still there ? " " It 's likely . " She shivered . " Could you find out ? " " I could go down and see . " " Oh , that 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment and then got up from the sofa saying : " Sure . " He got a hat and overcoat from the closet . " I 'll be gone about ten minutes . " " Do be careful , " she begged as she followed him to the corridor-door . He said , " I will , " and went out . Post Street was empty when Spade issued into it . He walked east a block , crossed the street , walked west two blocks on the other side , recrossed it , and returned to his building without having seen anyone except two mechanics working on a car in a garage . When he opened his apartment-door Brigid O'Shaughnessy was standing at the bend in the passageway , holding Cairo 's pistol straight down at her side . " He 's still there , " Spade said . She bit the inside of her lip and turned slowly , going back into the living-room . Spade followed her in , put his hat and overcoat on a chair , said , " So we 'll have time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He had put the coffee-pot on the stove when she came to the door , and was slicing a slender loaf of French bread . She stood in the doorway and watched him with preoccupied eyes . The fingers of her left hand idly caressed the body and barrel of the pistol her right hand still held . " The table-cloth 's in there , " he said , pointing the bread-knife at a cupboard that was one breakfast-nook partition . She set the table while he spread liverwurst on , or put cold corned beef between , the small ovals of bread he had sliced . Then he poured the coffee , added brandy to it from a squat bottle , and they sat at the table . They sat side by side on one of the benches . She put the pistol down on the end of the bench nearer her . " You can start now , between bites , " he said . She made a face at him , complained , " You 're the most insistent person , " and bit a sandwich . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird , this falcon , that everybody 's all steamed up about ? " She chewed the beef and bread in her mouth , swallowed it , looked attentively at the small crescent its removal had made in the sandwich 's rim , and asked : " Suppose I would n't tell you ? Suppose I would n't tell you anything at all about it ? What would you do ? " " You mean about the bird ? " " I mean about the whole thing . " " I would n't be too surprised , " he told her , grinning so that the edges of his jaw-teeth were visible , " to know what to do next . " " And that would be ? " She transferred her attention from the sandwich to his face . " That 's what I wanted to know : what would you do next ? " He shook his head . P105Mockery rippled in a smile on her face . " Something wild and unpredictable ? " " Maybe . But I do n't see what you 've got to gain by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bit anyhow . ' ' here 's a lot of it I do n't know , but there 's some of it I do , and some more that I can guess at , and , give me anotherday like this , I 'll soon be knowing things about it that you do n't know . " " I suppose you do now , " she said , looking at her sandwichagain , her face serious . " But  --  oh !  --  I 'm so tired of it , and I do so hate having to talk about it . Would n't it  --  would n't it be just as well to wait and let you learn about it as you say you will ? " Spade laughed . " I do n't know . You 'll have to figure that out for yourself . My way of learning is to heave a wild and unpredictable monkey-wrench into the machinery . It 's all right with me , if you 're sure none of the flyingpieces will hurt you . " She moved her bare shoulders uneasily , but said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he phlegmatically , she thoughtfully . Then she said in a hushed voice : " I 'm afraid of you , and that 's the truth . " He said : " That 's not the truth . " " It is , " she insisted in the same low voice . " I know two men I 'm afraid of and I 've seen both of them tonight . " " I can understand your being afraid of Cairo , " Spade said . " He 's out of your reach . " " And you are n't ? " " Not that way , " he said and grinned . She blushed . She picked up a slice of bread encrusted with grey liverwurst . She put it down on her plate . She wrinkled her white forehead and she said : " It 's a black figure , as you know , smooth and shiny , of a bird , a hawk or falcon , about that high . " She held her hands a foot apart . " What makes it important ? " She sipped coffee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know , " she said . " They 'd never tell me . They promised me five hundred pounds if I helped them get it . Then Floyd said afterward , after we 'd left Joe , that he 'd give me seven hundred and fifty . " " So it must be worth more than seventy-five hundred t dollars ? " " Oh , much more than that , " she said . " They did n't pretend that they were sharing equally with me . They were simply hiring me to help them . " " To help them how ? " She lifted her cup to her lips again . Spade , not movingthe domineering stare of his yellow-grey eyes from her face , began to make a cigarette . Behind them the percolator bubbled on the stove . " To help them get it from the man who had it , " she said slowly when she had lowered her cup , " a Russian named Kemidov . " " How ? " " Oh , but that 's not important , " she objected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled impudently  --  " and is certainly none of your business . " " This was in Constantinople ? " She hesitated , nodded , and said : " Marmora . " He waved his cigarette at her , saying : " Go ahead , what happened then ? " " But that 's all . I 've told you . They promised me five hundred pounds to help them and I did and then weP107found that Joe Cairo meant to desert us , taking the falconwith him and leaving us nothing . So we did exactly t hat to him , first . But then I was n't any better off than I had been before , because Floyd had n't any intention at all of paying me the seven hundred and fifty pounds he had promised me . I had learned that by the time we got here . He said we would go to New York , where he would sell it and give me my share , but I could see he was n't telling me the truth . " Indignation had darkened her eyes to violet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get you to help me learn where the falcon was . " " And suppose you 'd got it ? What then ? " " Then I 'd have been in a position to talk terms with Mr. Floyd Thursby . " Spade squinted at her and suggested : " But you would n't have known where to take it to get more money t Ilan he 'd give you , the larger sum that you knew he expected to sell it for ? " " I did not know , " she said . Spade scowled at the ashes he had dumped on his plate . " What makes it worth all that money ? " he demanded . " You must have some idea , at least be able to guess . " " I have n't the slightest idea . " He directed the scowl at her . " What 's it made of ? " " Porcelain or black stone . I do n't know . I 've never touched it . I 've only seen it once , for a few minutes . Floyd showed it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Spade mashed the end of his cigarette in his plate and made one draught of the coffee and brandy in his cup . His scowl had gone away . He wiped his lips with his napkin , dropped it crumpled on the table , and spoke casually : " You are a liar . " She got up and stood at the end of the table , looking down at him with dark abashed eyes in a pinkening face . " I am a liar , " she said . " I have always been a liar . " " Do n't brag about it . It 's childish . " His voice was good-humored . He came out from between table and bench . " Was there any truth at all in that yarn ? " She hung her head . Dampness glistened on her dark lashes . " Some , " she whispered . " How much ? " " Not  --  not very much . " Spade put a hand under her chin and lifted her head . He laughed into her wet eyes and said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll put some more brandy in some more coffee and we 'll try again . " Her eyelids drooped . " Oh , I 'm so tired , " she said tremulously , " so tired of it all , of myself , of lying and thinking up lies , and of not knowing what is a lie and what is the truth . I wish I  --  " She put her hands up to Spade 's cheeks , put her open mouth hard against his mouth , her body flat against his body . Spade 's arms went around her , holding her to him , muscles bulging his blue sleeves , a hand cradling her head , its fingers half lost among red hair , a hand movinggroping fingers over her slim back . His eyes burned yellowly .   BEGINNING day had reduced night to a thin smokiness when Spade sat up . At his side Brigid O'Shaughmessy'ssoft breathing had the regularity of utter sleep . Spade was quiet leaving bed and bedroom and shutting the bedroom-door . He dressed in the bathroom . Then he examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ key from the pocket of her coat , and went out . He went to the Coronet , letting himself into the buildingand into her apartment with the key . To the eye there was nothing furtive about his going in : he enteredboldly and directly . To the ear his going in was almost unnoticeable : he made as little sound as ' night be . In the girl 's apartment he switched on all the lights . Ile searched the place from wall to wall . His eyes and thick fingers moved without apparent haste , and withoutever lingering or fumbling or going back , from one inch of their fields to the next , probing , scrutinizing , testing with expert certainty . Every drawer , cupboard , cubbyhole , box , bag , trunk  --  locked or unlocked  --  was opened and its contents subjected to examination by eyes and fingers . Every piece of clothing was tested by hands that felt for telltale bulges and ears that listened for the crinkle of paper between pressing fingers . He stripped the bed of bedclothes . He looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of furniture . He pulled down blinds to see that nothing had been rolled up in them for concealment . He leaned through windows to see that nothing hung below them on the outside . He poked with a fork into powder and cream-jars on the dressing-table . He held atomizers and bottles up against the light . He examined dishes and pans and food and food-containers . He emptied the garbage-can on spread sheets of newspaper . He opened the top of the flushboxin the bathroom , drained the box , and peered down into it . He examined and tested the metal screens over the drains of bathtub , wash-bowl , sink , and laundrytub . He did not find the black bird . He found nothing that seemed to have any connection with a black bird . The only piece of writing he found was a week-old receiptfor the month 's apartment-rent Brigid O'Shaughnessyhad paid . The only thing he found that interested him enough to delay his search while he looked at it was a double-handful of rather fine jewelry in a polychromebox in a locked dressing-table-drawer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cup of coffee . Then he unlocked the kitchen-window , scarred the edge of its lock a little with his pocket-knife , opened the window  --  over a fire-escape  --  got his hat and overcoatfrom the settee in the living-room , and left the apartment as he had come . On his way home he stopped at a store that was being opened by a puffy-eyed shivering plump grocer and bought oranges , eggs , rolls , butter , and cream . P111Spade went quietly into his apartment , but before he had shut the corridor-door behind him Brigid O'Shaughnessycried : " Who is that ? " " Young Spade bearing breakfast . " " Oh , you frightened me ! " The bedroom-door he had shut was open . The girl sat on the side of the bed , trembling , with her right ! land out of sight under a pillow . Spade put his packages on the kitchen-table and went into the bedroom . He sat on the bed beside the girl , kissed her smooth shoulder , and said : " I wanted to see if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stuff for breakfast . " " Is he ? " " No . " She sighed and leaned against him . " I awakened and you were n't here and then I heard someone coming in . I was terrified . " Spade combed her red hair back from her face with his fingers and said : " I 'm sorry , angel . I thought you 'd sleep through it . Did you have that gun under your pillow all night ? " " No . You know I did n't . I jumped up and got it when I was frightened . " He cooked breakfast  --  and slipped the flat brass key into her coat-pocket again  --  while she bathed and dressed . She came out of the bathroom whistling En Cuba . " Shall I make the bed ? " she asked . " That 'd be swell . The eggs need a couple of minutes Wore : " P112Their breakfast was on the table when she returned to the kitchen . They sat where they had sat the night before and ate heartily . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ate . She put her fork down and looked at him . She drew her eyebrows together and made her mouth small and tight . " You ca n't ask me to talk about that this morning of all mornings , " she protested . " I do n't want to and I wo n't . " " It 's a stubborn damned hussy , " he said sadly and put a piece of roll into his mouth . The youth who had shadowed Spade was not in sight when Spade and Brigid O'Shaughnessy crossed the sidewalk to the waiting taxicab . The taxicab was not followed . Neither the youth nor another loiterer was visible in the vicinity of the Coronet when the taxicab arrived there . Brigid O'Shaughnessy would not let Spade go in with her . " It 's bad enough to be coming home in evening dress at this hour without bringing company . I hope I do n't meet anybody . " " Dinner tonight ? " " Yes . " They kissed . She went into the Coronet . He told the chauffeur : " Hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the youth who had shadowed him sitting in the lobby on a divan from which the elevators could be seen . Apparently the youth was reading a newspaper . At the desk Spade learned that Cairo was not in . Hep113frowned and pinched his lower lip . Points of yellow light began to dance in his eyes . " Thanks , " he said softly I o the clerk and turned away . Sauntering , he crossed the lobby to the divan from which the elevators could be seen and sat down beside  --  not more than a foot from  --  the young man who was apparentlyreading a newspaper . The young man did not look up from his newspaper . Seen at this scant distance , he seemed certainly less than twenty years old . His features were small , in keeping with his stature , and regular . His skin was very fair . The whiteness of his cheeks was as little blurred by any considerable growth of beard as by the glow of blood . I Iis clothing was neither new nor of more than ordinary quality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was marked Icy a hard masculine neatness . Spade asked casually , " Where is he ? " while shaking tobacco down into a brown paper curved to catch it . The boy lowered his paper and looked around , movingwith a purposeful sort of slowness , as of a more natural swiftness restrained . He looked with small hazel eyes under somewhat long curling lashes at Spade 's chest . He said , in a voice as colorless and composed and cold as his young face : " What ? " " Where is he ? " Spade was busy with his cigarette . " Who ? " " The fairy . " The hazel eyes ' gaze went up Spade 's chest to the knotof his maroon tie and rested there . " What do you thinkyou 're doing , Jack ? " the boy demanded . " Kidding me ? " " I 'll tell you when I am . " Spade licked his cigarette and smiled amiably at the boy . " New York , are n't you ? "   The boy stared at Spade 's tie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boy had said yes and asked : " Baumes rush ? " The boy stared at Spade 's tie for a moment longer , then raised his newspaper and returned his attention to it . " Shove off , " he said from the side of his mouth . Spade lighted his cigarette , leaned back comfortably on the divan , and spoke with good-natured carelessness : " You 'll have to talk to me before you 're through , sonny  --  some of you will  --  and you can tell G. I said so . " The boy put his paper down quickly and faced Spade , staring at his necktie with bleak hazel eyes . The boy 's small hands were spread flat over his belly . " Keep asking for it and you 're going to get it , " he said , " plenty . " His voice was low and flat and menacing . " I told you to shove off . Shove off . " Spade waited until a bespectacled pudgy man and a thin-legged blonde girl had passed out of hearing . Then he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on Seventh Avenue . But you 're not in Romeville now . You 're in my burg . " He inhaled cigarette-smoke and blew it out in a long pale cloud . " Well , where is he ? " The boy spoke two words , the first a short guttural verb , the second " you . " " People lose teeth talking like that . " Spade 's voice was still amiable though his face had become wooden . " If you want to hang around you 'll be polite . " The boy repeated his two words . Spade dropped his cigarette into a tall stone jar beside the divan and with a lifted hand caught the attention of a man who had been standing at an end of the cigar-stand for several minutes . The man nodded andp115came towards them . He was a middle-aged man of medium height , round and sallow of face , compactly built , tidily dressed in dark clothes . " Hello , Sam , " he said as he came up . " Hello , Luke . " They shook hands and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Miles . " " 17h-huh , a bad break . " Spade jerked his head to indicate the boy on the divan beside him . " What do you let these cheap gunmen hang out in your lobby for , with their tools bulging their clothes ? " " Yes ? " Luke examined the boy with crafty brown eyes set in a suddenly hard face . " What do you want here ? " he asked . The boy stood up . Spade stood up . The boy looked at the two men , at their neckties , from one to the other . Luke 's necktie was black . The boy looked like a schoolboystanding in front of them . Luke said : " Well , if you do n't want anything , beat it , and do n't come back . " The boy said , " I wo n't forget you guys , " and went out . They watched him go out . Spade took off his hat and wiped his damp forehead with a handkerchief . The hotel-detective asked : " What is it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replied . " I just happened to spot him . Know anything about Joel Cairo  --  six-. thirty-five ? " " Oh , that one ! " The hotel detective leered . " How long 's he been here ? " " Four days . This is the fifth . " " What about him ? "  | " Search me , Sam . I got nothing against him but his looks . " " Find out if he came in last night ? " " Try to , " the hotel-detective promised and went away . Spade sat on the divan until he returned . " No , " Luke reported , " he did n't sleep in his room . What is it ? " " Nothing . " " Come clean . You know I 'll keep my clam shut , but if there 's anything wrong we ought to know about it so 's we can collect our bill . " " Nothing like that , " Spade assured him . " As a matter of fact , I 'm doing a little work for him . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 'd better . Want me to kind of keep an eye on him ? " " Thanks , Luke . It would n't hurt . You ca n't know too much about the men you 're working for these days . " It was twenty-one minutes past eleven by the clock over the elevator-doors when Joel Cairo came in from the street . His forehead was bandaged . His clothes had the limp unfreshness of too many hours ' consecutive wear . His face was pasty , with sagging mouth and eyelids . Spade met in front of the desk . " Good morning , " Spade said easily . Cairo drew his tired body up straight and the droopinglines of his face tightened . " Good morning , " he respondedwithout enthusiasm . There was a pause . Spade said : " Let 's go some place where we can talk . " Cairo raised his chin . " Please excuse me , " he said.  | " Our conversations in private have not been such that I am anxious to continue them . Pardon my speaking bluntly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last night ? " Spade made an impatient gesture with head and hands . " What in hell else could I do ? I thought you 'd see that . If you pick a fight with Tier , or let her pick one with you , I 've got to throw in with her . I do n't know where that damned bird is . You do n't . She does . How in hell are we going to get it if I do n't play along with her ? " Cairo hesitated , said dubiously : " You have always , , I must say , a smooth explanation ready . " Spade scowled . " What do you want me to do ? Learn to stutter ? Well , we can talk over here . " He led the way to the divan . When they were seated he asked : " Dundy take you down to the Hall ? " " Yes . " " How long did they work on you ? " " Until a very little while ago , and very much against my will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and voice . " I shall certainly take the matter up with the Consulate General of Greece and with an attorney . " " Go ahead , and see what it gets you . What did you let the police shake out of you ? " There was prim satisfaction in Cairo 's smile . " Not a single thing . I adhered to the course you indicated earlier in your rooms . " His smile went away . " Though I certainly wished you had devised a more reasonable story . I felt decidedly ridiculous repeating it . " Spade grinned mockingly . " Sure , " he said , " but its goofiness is what makes it good . You sure you did n't give them anything ? "  | " You may rely upon it , Mr. Spade , I did not . " Spade drummed with his fingers on the leather seat between them . " You 'll be hearing from Dundy again . Stay dummied-up on him and you 'll be all right . Do n't worry about the story 's goofiness . A sensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He rose to his feet . " You 'll want sleep if you 've been standing up under a policestormall night . See you later . " Effie Perine was saying , " No , not yet , " into the telephonewhen Spade entered his outer office . She looked around at him and her lips shaped a silent word : " Iva . " He shook his head . " Yes , I 'll have him call you as soon as he comes in , " she said aloud and replaced the receiver on its prong . " That 's the third time she 's called up this morning , " she told Spade . He made an impatient growling noise . The girl moved her brown eyes to indicate the inner office . " Your Miss O'Shaughnessy 's in there . She 's been waiting since a few minutes after nine . " Spade nodded as if he had expected that and asked : " What else ? " " Sergeant Polhaus called up . He did n't leave any message . " " Get him for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's eyes brightened . He asked : " Who ? " " G. That 's what he said . " Her air of personal indifference to the subject was flawless . " When I told him you were n't in he said : When he comes in , will you please tell him that G. , who got his message , phoned and will phone again ? ' . "  |p119S|pade  worked his lips together as if tasting something he liked . " ' Thanks , darling , " he said . " See if you can get Tom Polhaus . " He opened the inner door and went into Iris private office , pulling the door to behind him . Brigid O'Shaughnessy , dressed as on her first visit to the office , rose from a chair beside his desk and came quickly towards him . " Somebody has been in myapart- Went , " she exclaimed . " It is all upside-down , every which way . " He seemed moderately surprised . " Anything taken ? " " I do n't think so . I do n't know . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as I could and came down here . Oh , ' . on must 've let that boy follow you there ! " Spade shook his head . " No , angel . " He took an early copy of an afternoon paper from his pocket , opened it , and showed her a quarter-column headed SCREAM ROUTS BURGLAR . A young woman named Carolin Beale , who lived alone in a Sutter Street apartment , had been awakened at four that morning by the sound of somebody moving in her bedroom . She had screamed . The mover had ran , Tway . Two other women who lived alone in the same building had discovered , later in the morning , signs of 1,1 le burglar 's having visited their apartments . Nothing had been taken from any of the three . " That 's where I shook him , " Spade explained . " I went into that building and ducked out the back door . That 's  --  by all three were women who lived alone . He tried the apartments that had women 's names in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But he was watching your place when we were t here , " she objected .   Spade shrugged . " There 's no reason to think he 's working alone . Or maybe he went to Sutter Street after he had begun to think you were going to stay all night in my place . There are a lot of maybes , but I did n't lead him to the Coronet . " She was not satisfied . " But he found it , or somebody did . " " Sure . " He frowned at her feet . " I wonder if it could have been Cairo . He was n't at his hotel all night , did n't get in till a few minutes ago . He told me he had been standing up under a police-grilling all night . I wonder . " He turned , opened the door , and asked Effie Perine : " Got Tom yet ? " " He 's not in . I 'll try again in a few minutes . " " Thanks . " Spade shut the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . " You went to see Joe this morning ? " she asked . " Yes . " She hesitated . " Why ? " " Why ? " He smiled down at her . " Because , my own true love , I 've got to keep in some sort of touch with all the loose ends of this dizzy affair if I 'm ever going to make heads or tails of it . " He put an arm around her shoulders and led her over to his swivel-chair . He kissed the tip of her nose lightly and set her down in the chair . He sat on the desk in front of her . He said : " Now we 've got to find a new home for you , have n't we ? " She nodded with emphasis . " I wo n't go back there . " He patted the desk beside his thighs and made a thoughtful face . " I think I 've got it , " he said presently .   " Wait a minute . " He went into the outer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone , saying : " I 'll try again . " " Afterwards . Does your woman 's intuition still tell you that she 's a madonna or something ? " She looked sharply up at him . " I still believe that no matter what kind of trouble she 's gotten into she 's all right , if that 's what you mean . " " That 's what I mean , " he said . " Are you strong enough for her to give her a lift ? " " How ? " " Could you put her up for a few days ? " " You mean at home ? " " Yes . Her joint 's been broken into . That 's the second burglary she 's had this week . It 'd be better for her if she was n't alone . It would help a lot if you could take her in . " Effie Perine leaned forward , asking earnestly : " Is she really in danger , Sam ? " " I think she is . " She scratched her lip with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green hemorrhage . I 'll have to tell her site 's a surprise-witness or something that you 're keeping under cover till the last minute . " " You 're a darling , " Spade said . " Better take her out there now . I 'll get her key from her and bring whatever she needs over from her apartment . Let 's see . You ought n't to be seen leaving here together . You go home now . Take a taxi , but make sure you are n't followed . You probably wo n't be , but make sure . I 'll send her out in another in a little while , making sure she is n't followed . "   THE telephone-bell was ringing when Spade returned to his office after sending Brigid O'Shaughnessy off to Effie Perine 's house . He went to the telephone . " Hello . . . . Yes , this is Spade . . . . Yes , I got it . I 've been waiting to hear from you . . . . Who ? . . . Mr. Gutman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now  --  the sooner the better . . . . Twelve C. . . . Right . Say fifteen min- 1 utes . . . . Right . " Spade sat on the corner of his desk beside the telephone and rolled a cigarette . His mouth was a hard complacent v. His eyes , watching his fingers make the cigarette , smoldered over lower lids drawn up straight . The door opened and Iva Archer came in . Spade said , " Hello , honey , " in a voice as lightly amiableas his face had suddenly become . " Oh , Sam , forgive me ! forgive me ! " she cried in a i choked voice . She stood just inside the door , wadding a black-bordered handkerchief in her small gloved hands , peering into his face with frightened red and swollen eyes . He did not get up from his seat on the desk-corner . He said : " Sure . That 's all right . Forget it . " " But , Sam , " she wailed , " I sent those policemen there . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them that if they 'd go there they 'd learn something about Miles 's murder . " THE FAT MAN 123 " What made you think that ? " " Oh , I did n't ! But I was mad , Sam , and I wanted to hurt you . " " It made things damned awkward . " He put his arm around her and drew her nearer . " But it 's all right now , only do n't get any more crazy notions like that . " " I wo n't , " she promised , " ever . But you were n't nice t o me last night . You were cold and distant and wanted t o get rid of me , when I had come down there and waited tot long to warn you , and you  --  " " Warn me about what ? " " About Phil . He 's found out about  --  about you being in love with me , and Miles had told him about my wantinga divorce , though of course he never knew what for , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't give me the divorce so we could get married . ( Ie told me he believed that , and yesterday he went and t old the police . " " That 's nice , " Spade said softly . " And you came to am me , and because I was busy you got up on your ear and helped this damned Phil Archer stir things up . " " I 'm sorry , " she whimpered , " I know you wo n't forgive me . I  --  I 'm sorry , sorry , sorry . " " You ought to be , " he agreed , " on your own account as well as mine . Has Dundy been to see you since Phil ( lid his talking ? Or anybody from the bureau ? " " No . " Alarm opened her eyes and mouth . " They will , " he said , " and it 'd be just as well to not let them find you here . Did you tell them who you were lien you phoned ? " " Oh , no ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your apartment right away they 'd learn something about the . murder and hung up . " " Where 'd you phone from ? " " The drug-store up above your place . Oh , Sam , dearest , I  --  " He patted her shoulder and said pleasantly : " It was a dumb trick , all right , but it 's done now . You 'd better run along home and think up things to tell the police . You 'll be hearing from them . Maybe it 'd be best to say no ' right across the board . " He frowned at something distant . " Or maybe you 'd better see Sid Wise first . " He removed his arm from around her , took a card out of his pocket , scribbled three lines on its back , and gave it to her . " You can tell Sid everything . " He frowned . " Or almost everything . Where were you the night Miles wail shot ? " " Home , " she replied without hesitating . He shook his head , grinning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No , " he said , " but if that 's your story it 's all righ with me . Go see Sid . It 's up on the next corner , the pink ish building , room eight-twenty-seven . " Her blue eyes tried to probe his yellow-grey one . " What makes you think I was n't home ? " she askslowly . " Nothing except that I know you were n't . " " But I was , I was . " Her lips twisted and anger dark ened her eyes . " Effie Perine told you that , " she said indignantly . " I saw her looking at my clothes and snoopingaround . You know she does n't like me , Sam . Why do you believe things she tells you when you know she 'd do anything to make trouble for me ? "  | " Jesus , you women , " Spade said mildly . He looked at the watch on his wrist . " You 'll have to trot along , precious . I 'm late for an appointment now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were you I 'd tell Sid the truth or nothing . I mean leave out the parts you do n't want to tell him , but do n't make up anything to take its place . " " I 'm not lying to you , Sam , " she protested . " Like hell you 're not , " he said and stood up . She strained on tiptoe to hold her face nearer his . " You do n't believe me ? " she whispered . " I do n't believe you . " " And you wo n't forgive me for  --  for what I did ? " " Sure I do . " He bent his head and kissed her mouth , " ' That 's all right . Now run along . " She put her arms around him . " Wo n't you go with me to see Mr. Wise ? " " I ca n't , and I 'd only be in the way . " He patted her arms , took them from around his body , and kissed her left wrist between glove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , turned her to face the door , and released h r with a little push . " Beat it , " he ordered . The mahogany door of suite 12-C at the AlexandriaHotel was opened by the boy Spade had talked to in the Belvedere lobby . Spade said , " Hello , " goodnaturedly . The boy did not say anything . He stood aside holding the door open . Spade went in . A fat man came to meet him . The fat man was flabbily fat with bulbous pink cheeks and lips and chins and neck , with a great soft egg of a belly that was all his torso , and pendant cones for armsP126and legs . As he advanced to meet Spade all his bulbs rose and shook and fell separately with each step , in the manner of clustered soap-bubbles not yet released from the pipe through which they had been blown . His eyes , made small by fat puffs around them , were dark and sleek . Dark ringlets thinly covered his broad scalp . He wore a black cutaway coat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pearl , striped grey worsted trousers , and patent-leather shoes . His voice was a throaty purr . " Ah , Mr. Spade , " he said with enthusiasm and held out a hand like a fat pink star . Spade took the hand and smiled and said : " How do you do , Mr. Gutman ? " Holding Spade 's hand , the fat man turned beside him , put his other hand to Spade 's elbow , and guided him across a green rug to a green plush chair beside a table that held a siphon , some glasses , and a bottle of Johnnie Walker whiskey on a tray , a box of cigars  --  Coronas del Ritz  --  two newspapers , and a small and plain yellow soapstone box . Spade sat in the green chair . The fat man began to fill two glasses from bottle and siphon . The boy had disappeared . Doors set in three of the room 's walls were shut . The fourth wall , behind Spade , was pierced by two windows looking out over Geary Street . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purred , turning with a proffered glass in his hand . " I distrust a man that says when . If he 's got to be careful not to drink too much it 's because he 's not to be trusted when he does . " Spade took the glass and , smiling , made the beginning of a bow over it.  |p127The  fat man raised his glass and held it against a window 's light . He nodded approvingly at the bubbles running up in it . He said : " Well , sir , here 's to plain speaking and clear understanding . " They drank and lowered their glasses . The fat man looked shrewdly at Spade and asked : " You 're a close-mouthed man ? " Spade shook his head . " I like to talk . " " Better and better ! " the fat man exclaimed . " I distrusta close-mouthed man . He generally picks the wrong time to talk and says the wrong things . Talking'ssomething you ca n't do judiciously unless you keep in practice . " He beamed over his glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we will . " He set his glass on the table and held the box of Coronas del Ritz out to Spade . " A cigar , sir . " Spade took a cigar , trimmed the end of it , and lighted it . Meanwhile the fat man pulled another green plush chair around to face Spade 's within convenient distanceand placed a smoking-stand within reach of both chairs . Then he took his glass from the table , took a cigar from the box , and lowered himself into his chair . his bulbs stopped jouncing and settled into flabby rest . He sighed comfortably and said : " Now , sir , we 'll talk if you like . And I 'll tell you right out that I 'm a man who likes talking to a man that likes to talk . " " Swell . Will we talk about the black bird ? " The fat man laughed and his bulbs rode up and down on his laughter . " Will we ? " he asked and , " We will , " he replied . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the man for me , sir , a man cut along my own lines . No beating about the bush , but right to the point . Will we talk about the black bird ? ' We will . I like that , sir . I like that way of doing business . Let us talk about the black bird by all means , but first , sir , answer me a question , please , though maybe it 's an unnecessary one , so we 'll understand each other from the beginning . You 're here as Miss O'Shaughnessy 's representative ? " Spade blew smoke above the fat man 's head in a long slanting plume . He frowned thoughtfully at the ashtippedend of his cigar . He replied deliberately : " I ca n't say yes or no . There 's nothing certain about it either way , yet . " He looked up at the fat man and stopped frowning . " It depends . " " It depends on  --  ? " Spade shook his head . " If I knew what it depends on I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took a mouthful from his glass , swallowed it , and suggested : " Maybe it depends on Joel Cairo ? " Spade 's prompt " Maybe " was noncommittal . He drank . The fat man leaned forward until his belly stopped him . His smile was ingratiating and so was his purring voice . " You could say , then , that the question is which one of them you 'll represent ? " " You could put it that way . " " It will be one or the other ? " " I did n't say that . " The fat man 's eyes glistened . His voice sank to a throaty whisper asking : " Who else is there ? " Spade pointed his cigar at his own chest . " There 's me , " he said . The fat man sank back in his chair and let his bodyP129go flaccid . He blew his breath out in a long contented gust . " That 's wonderful , sir , " he purred . " That 's wonderful . I do like a man that tells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't we all ? I do n't trust a man that says he 's not . And the man that 's telling the truth when he says he 's not I distrust most of all , because he 's an ass and an ass that 's going contrary to the laws of nature . " Spade exhaled smoke . His face was politely attentive . Ile said : " Uh-huh . Now let 's talk about the black bird . " The fat man smiled benevolently . " Let 's , " he said . He squinted so that fat puffs crowding together left nothing of his eyes but a dark gleam visible . " Mr. Spade , have you any conception of how much money can be made out of that black bird ? " " No . " The fat man leaned forward again and put a bloated pink hand on the arm of Spade 's chair . " Well , sir , if I told you  --  by Gad , if I told you half !  --  you 'd call me a liar . " Spade smiled . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I thought it . But if you wo n't take the risk just tell me what it is and I 'll figure out the profits . " The fat man laughed . " You could n't do it , sir . Nobodycould do it that had n't had a world of experience with things of that sort , and "  --  he paused impressively  --  " there are n't any other things of that sort . " His bulbs jostled one another as he laughed again . He stopped laughing , abruptly . His fleshy lips hung open as laughter had left them . He stared at Spade with an intentness that suggested myopia . He asked : " You meanP130you do n't know what it is ? " Amazement took the throatinessout of his voice . Spade made a careless gesture with his cigar . " Oh , hell , " he said lightly , " I know what it 's supposed to look like . I know the value in life you people put on it . I do n't know what it is . " " She did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . A lovely girl , sir . " " Uh-huh . No . " The fat man 's eyes were dark gleams in ambush behindpink puffs of flesh . He said indistinctly , " She must know , " and then , " And Cairo did n't either ? " " Cairo is cagey . He 's willing to buy it , but he wo n't risk telling me anything I do n't know already . " The fat man moistened his lips with his tongue . " How much is he willing to buy it for ? " he asked . " Ten thousand dollars . " The fat man laughed scornfully . " Ten thousand , and dollars , mind you , not even pounds . That 's the Greek for you . Humph ! And what did you say to that ? " " I said if I turned it over to him I 'd expect the ten thousand . " " Ah , yes , if ! Nicely put , sir . " The fat man 's foreheadsquirmed in a flesh-blurred frown . " They @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then : " Do they ? Do they know what the bird is , sir ? What was your impres-sion ? " " I ca n't help you there , " Spade confessed . " There 's not much to go by . Cairo did n't say he did and he did n't say he did n't . She said she did n't , but I took it for granted that she was lying . "   " That was not an injudicious thing to do , " the fat man said , but his mind was obviously not on his words . He scratched his head . He frowned until his forehead was marked by raw red creases . He fidgeted in his chair as much as his size and the size of the chair permitted fidgeting . He shut his eyes , opened them suddenlywide  --  andsaid to Spade : " Maybe they do n't . " His bulbous pink face slowly lost its worried frown and then , more quickly , took on an expression of ineffable happiness . " If they do n't , " he cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm the only one in the whole wide sweet world who does ! " Spade drew his lips back in a tight smile . " I 'm glad I came to the right place , " he said . The fat man smiled too , but somewhat vaguely . Happinesshad gone out of his face , though he continued to mile , and caution had come into his eyes . His face waswatchful-eyed smiling mask held up between his Noughts and Spade . His eyes , avoiding Spade 's , shifted o the glass at Spade 's elbow . His face brightened . " By Gad , sir , " he said , " your glass is empty . " He got up and went to the table and clattered glasses and siphon and bottle mixing two drinks . Spade was immobile in his chair until the fat man , with a flourish and a bow and a jocular " Ah , sir , this kind of medicine will never hurt you ! " had handed him Imis refilled glass . Then Spade rose and stood close to he fat man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ere hard and bright . He raised his glass . His voice wasdeliberate , challenging : " Here 's to plain speaking and clear understanding . " The fat man chuckled and they drank . The fat manP132sat down . He held his glass against his belly with both hands and smiled up at Spade . He said : " Well , sir , it 's surprising , but it well may be a fact that neither of them does know exactly what that bird is , and that nobody in all this whole wide sweet world knows what it is , saving and excepting only your humble servant , Casper Gutman , Esquire . " " Swell . " Spade stood with legs apart , one hand in his trousers-pocket , the other holding his glass . " When you 've told me there 'll only be two of us who know . " " Mathematically correct , sir "  --  the fat man 's eyes twinkled  --  " but "  - -  - his smile spread  --  " I do n't know for certain that I 'm going to tell you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade said patiently . " You know what it is . I know where it is . That 's why we 're here . " " Well , sir , where is it ? " Spade ignored the question . The fat man bunched his lips , raised his eyebrows , and cocked his head a little to the left . " You see , " he said blandly , " I must tell you what I know , but you will not tell me what you know . That is hardly equitable , sir . No , no , I do not think we can do business along those lines . " Spade 's face became pale and hard . He spoke rapidly in a low furious voice : " Think again and think fast . I told that punk of yours that you 'd have to talk to me before you got through . I 'll tell you now that you 'll do your talking today or you are through . What are you wasting my time for ? You and your lousy secret ! Christ ! I know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtreasury vaults , but what good does that do me ? Ip133can get along without you . God damn you ! Maybe you could have got along without me if you 'd kept clear of me . You ca n't now . Not in San Francisco . You 'll come in or you 'll get out  --  and you 'll do it today . " He turned and with angry heedlessness tossed his glass at the table . The glass struck the wood , burst apart , and splashed its contents and glittering fragmentsover table and floor . Spade , deaf and blind to the crash , wheeled to confront the fat man again . The fat man paid no more attention to the glass 's fate than Spade did : lips pursed , eyebrows raised , head cocked a little to the left , he had maintained his pinkfacedblandness throughout Spade 's angry speech , and he maintained it now . Spade , still furious , said : " And another thing , I do n't want " The door to Spade 's left opened . The boy who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stood in front of it with his hands flat against his flanks , and looked at Spade . The boy 's eyes were wide open and dark with wide pupils . Their gaze ran over Spade 's body from shoulders to knees , and up again to settle on the handkerchief whose maroon border peeped from the breast-pocket of Spade 's brown coat . " Another thing , " Spade repeated , glaring at the boy : " Keep that gunnel away from me while you 're making up your mind . I 'll kill him . I do n't like him . He makes ine nervous . I 'll kill him the first time he gets in my way . I wo n't give him an even break . I wo n't give him a chance . I 'll kill him . " The boy 's lips twitched in a shadowy smile . He neither raised his eyes nor spoke.  |p134The  fat man said tolerantly : " Well , sir , I must say you have a most violent temper . " " Temper ? " Spade laughed crazily . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hat , picked up the hat , and set it on his head . He held out a long arm that ended in a thick forefinger pointing at the fat man 's belly . His angry voice filled the room . " Think it over and think like hell . You 've got till five-thirty to do it in . Then you 're either in or out , for keeps . " He let his arm drop , scowled at the bland fat man for a moment , scowled at the boy , and went to the door through which he had entered . When he opened the door he turned and said harshly : " Five-thirty  --  then the curtain . " The boy , staring at Spade 's chest , repeated the two words he had twice spoken in the Belvedere lobby . His voice was not loud . It was bitter . Spade went out and slammed the door . P135PARE rode down from Gutman 's floor in an elevator . His lips were dry and rough in a face otherwise pale and damp . When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hand trembling . He grinned at it and said , " Whew ! " so loudly that the elevator-operator turned his head over his shoulder and asked : " Sir ? " Spade walked down Geary Street to the Palace Hotel , where he ate luncheon . His face had lost his pallor , his lips their dryness , and his hand its trembling by the time he had sat down . He ate hungrily without haste , and then went to Sid Wise 's office . When Spade entered , Wise was biting a fingernail and staring at the window . He took his hand from his mouth , screwed his chair around to face Spade , and said : " ' Lo . Push a chair up . " Spade moved a chair to the side of the big paperladendesk and sat down . " Mrs. Archer come in ? " he asked . " Yes . " The faintest of lights flickered in Wise 's eyes . " Going to marry the lady , Sammy ? " Spade sighed irritably through his nose . " Christ , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brief tired smile lifted the corners of the lawyer 's mouth . " If you do n't , " he said , " you 're going to have a job on your hands . " P136Spade looked up from the cigarette he was making and spoke sourly : " You mean you are ? Well , that 's what you 're for . What did she tell you ? " " About you ? " " About anything I ought to know . " Wise ran fingers through his hair , sprinkling dandruffdown on his shoulders . " She told me she had tried to get a divorce from Miles so she could  --  " " I know all that , " Spade interrupted him . " You can skip it . Get to the part I do n't know . " " How do I know how much she  --  ? " " Quit stalling , Sid . " Spade held the flame of his lighter to the end of his cigarette . " What did she tell you that she wanted kept from me ? " Wise looked reprovingly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began , " that 's not  --  " Spade looked heavenward at the ceiling and groaned : " Dear God , he 's my own lawyer that 's got rich off me and I have to get down on my knees and beg him to tell me things ! " He lowered at Wise . " What in hell do you think I sent her to you for ? " Wise made a weary grimace . " Just one more client like you , " he complained , " and I 'd be in a sanatariumorSan Quentin . " " You 'd be with most of your clients . Did she tell you where she was the night he was killed ? " " Yes . " " Where ? " " Following him . " Spade sat up straight and blinked . He exclaimed incredulously : " Jesus , these women ! " Then he laughed , relaxed , and asked : " Well , what did she see ? " P137Wise shook his head . " Nothing much . When he came home for dinner that evening he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Mark , ragging her , telling her Ihat was her chance to get the divorce she wanted . She t bought at first he was just trying to get under her skin . Ile knew  --  " " I know the family history , " Spade said . " Skip it . ' yell me what she did . " " I will if you 'll give me a chance . After he had gone out she began to think that maybe he might have had I hat date . You know Miles . It would have been like him io  --  " " You can skip Miles 's character too . " " I ought n't to tell you a damned thing , " the lawyer said . " So she got their car from the garage and drove down to the St. Mark , sitting in the car across the street . She saw him come out of the hotel and she saw that he was shadowing a man and a girl  --  she says she saw the same girl with you last night  --  who had come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was working , had been kidding her . I suppose she was disappointed , and mad  --  she sounded that way when she told ine about it . She followed Miles long enough to make sure he was shadowing the pair , and then she went up to your apartment . You were n't home . " " What time was that ? " Spade asked . " When she got to your place ? Between half-past nine and ten the first time . " " The first time ? " " Yes . She drove around for half an hour or so and then tried again . That would make it , say , ten-thirty . You were still out , so she drove back downtown andp138went to a movie to kill time until after midnight , when she thought she 'd be more likely to find you in . " Spade frowned . " She went to a movie at ten-thirty ? " " So she says  --  the one on Powell Street that stays open till one in the morning . She did n't want to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be there when Miles came . That always made him mad , it seems , especially if it was around midnight . She stayed in the movie till it closed . " Wise 's words came out slower now and there was a sardonic glint in his eye . " She says she had decidedby then not to go back to your place again . She says she did n't know whether you 'd like having her drop in that late . So she went to Tait 's  --  the one on Ellis Street  --  had something to eat and then went home  --  alone . " Wise rocked back in his chair and waited for Spade to speak . Spade 's face was expressionless . He asked : " You believeher ? " " Do n't you ? " Wise replied . " How do I know ? How do I know it is n't something you fixed up between you to tell me ? " Wise smiled . " You do n't cash many checks for strangers , do you , Sammy ? " " Not basketfuls . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was at least two o'clock by then  --  must 've been  --  and he was dead . " " Miles was n't home , " Wise said . " That seems to have made her mad again  --  his not being home first to bemade mad by her not being home . So she took the carout of the garage again and went back to your place . " " And I was n't home . I was down looking at Miles'sp139corpse . Jesus , what a swell lot of merry-go-round riding . Then what ? " " She went home , and her husband still was n't there , and while she was undressing your messenger came with the news of his death . " Spade did n't speak until he had with great care rolled and lighted another cigarette . Then he said : " I think that 's an all right spread . It seems to click with most of t lie known facts . It ought to hold . " Wise 's fingers , running through his hair again , combed more dandruff down on his shoulders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked : " But you do n't believe it ? " Spade plucked his cigarette from between his lips . " I do n't believe it or disbelieve it , Sid . I do n't know a damned thing about it . " A wry smile twisted the lawyer 's mouth . He moved his shoulders wearily and said : " That 's right  --  I 'm sellingyou out . Why do n't you get an honest lawyer  --  one you can trust ? " " That fellow 's dead . " Spade stood up . He sneered at Vise . " Getting touchy , huh ? I have n't got enough to think about : now I 've got to remember to be polite to you . What did I do ? Forget to genuflect when I came in ? " Sid Wise smiled sheepishly . " You 're a son of a gun , Sammy , " he said . Effie Perine was standing in the center of Spade 's outer office when he entered . She looked at him with worriedbrown eyes and asked : " What happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What happened where ? " he demanded . " Why did n't she come ? " Spade took two long steps and caught Effie Perine by the shoulders . " She did n't get there ? " he bawled into her frightened face . She shook her head violently from side to side . " I waited and waited and she did n't come , and I could n't get you on the phone , so I came down . " Spade jerked his hands away from her shoulders , thrust them far down in his trousers-pockets , said , " Anothermerry-go-round , " in a loud enraged voice , and strode into his private office . He came out again . " Phone your mother , " he commanded . " See if she 's come yet . " He walked up and down the office while the girl used the telephone . " No , " she said when she had finished . " Did  --  did you send her out in a taxi ? " His grunt probably meant yes . " Are you sure she  --  Somebody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ floor . He put his hands on his hips and glared at the girl . He addressed her in a loud savage voice : " Nobody followed her . Do you think I 'm a God-damned schoolboy ? I made sure of it before I put her in the cab , I rode a dozen blocks with her to be more sure , and I checked her another half-dozen blocks after I got out . " " Well , but  --  " " But she did n't get there . You 've told me that . I believe it . Do you think I think she did get there ? " Effie Perine sniffed . " You certainly act like a Goddamneddamned schoolboy , " she said.  |p141S|pade  made a harsh noise in his throat and went to the corridor-door . " I 'm going out and find her if I have to dig up sewers , " he said . " Stay here till I 'm back or you hear from me . For Christ 's sake let 's do something right . " He went out , walked half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Effie Perine was sitting at her desk when he opened the door . He said : " You ought to know better than to pay any attention to me when I talk like that . " " If you think I pay any attention to you you 're crazy , " she replied , " only "  --  she crossed her arms and felt her shoulders , and her mouth twitched uncertainly  --  " I wo n't be able to wear an evening gown for two weeks , you big brute . " He grinned humbly , said , " I 'm no damned good , darling , " made an exaggerated bow , and went out again . Two yellow taxicabs were at the corner-stand to which Spade went . Their chauffeurs were standing together talking . Spade asked : " Where 's the red-faced blond driver that was here at noon ? " " Got a Ioad , " one of the chauffeurs said . " Will he be back here ? " " I guess so . " The other chauffeur ducked his head to the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to the corner and stood by the curb until the red-faced blond chauffeur had parked his cab and got out . Then Spade went up to him and said : " I got into your cab with a lady at noontime . We went out Stockton Street and up Sacramento to Jones , where I got out . " " Sure , " the red-faced man said , " I remember that . " " I told you to take her to a Ninth-Avenue-number . You did n't take her there . Where did you take her ? " The chauffeur rubbed his cheek with a grimy hand and looked doubtfully at Spade . " I do n't know about this . " " It 's all right , " Spade assured him , giving him one of his cards . " If you want to play safe , though , we can ride up to your office and get your superintendent 's OK . " " I guess it 's all right . I took her to the Ferry Build-ing . " " By herself ? " " Yeah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else first ? " " No . It was like this : after we dropped you I wen on out Sacramento , and when we got to Polk she rapped on the glass and said she wanted to get a newspaper , s . I stopped at the corner and whistled for a kid , and sh got her paper . " " Which paper ? " " The Call . Then I went on out Sacramento some more , and just after we 'd crossed Van Ness she knocked on the glass again and said take her to the Ferry Building . " " Was she excited or anything ? " " Not so 's I noticed . " " And when you got to the Ferry Building ? " " She paid me off , and that was all . " " Anybody waiting for her there ? " " I did n't see them if they was . "  | " Which way did she go ? " " At the Ferry ? I do n't know . Maybe upstairs , or towards the stairs . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had it tucked under her arm when she paid me . " " With the pink sheet outside , or one of the white ? " " Hell , Cap , I do n't remember that . " Spade thanked the chauffeur , said , " Get yourself a moke , " and gave him a silver dollar . Spade bought a copy of the Call and carried it into n **25;30;TOOLONG to examine it out of theHis eyes ran swiftly over the front-page-headlines and over those on the second and third pages . They paused for a moment under SUSPECT ARRESTED AS COUNTERFEITER on the fourth page , andgain on page five under BAY YOUTH SEEKS DEATH WITH BULLET . Pages six and seven held nothing to interest him . On eight 3 BOYS ARRESTEDAS S. F. BURGLARS AFTER SHOOT-I NG held his attention for a moment , and after that nothing until he reached the thirty-fifth page , which held news of the weather , shipping , produce , finance , divorce , births , marriages , and deaths . He . read the list of dead , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found nothing to stop his eyes on the thirty-eighth and last page , sighed , folded the newspaper , put it in his coat-pocket , and rolled a cigarette . For five minutes he stood there in the **31;57;TOOLONG and staring sulkily at nothing . Them he walked up to Stockton Street , hailed a taxicab , and had himself driven to the Coronet . He let himself into the building and into Brigid O'Shaughnessy 's apartment with the key she had given him . The blue gown she had worn the previous night ; was hanging across the foot of her bed . Her blue stockingsand slippers were on the bedroom floor . The polychromebox that had held jewelry in her dressing-tabledrawernow stood empty on the dressing-table-top . Spade frowned at it , ran his tongue across his lips , strolled through the rooms , looking around but not touching anything , then left the Coronet and went downtown again . In the doorway of Spade 's office-building he came face to face with the boy he had left at Gutman 's . The ' boy put himself in Spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on . He wants to see you . " The boy 's hands were in his overcoat-pockets . His pockets bulged more than his hands need have made them bulge . Spade grinned and said mockingly : " I did n't expect you till five-twenty-five . I hope I have n't kept you waiting . " The boy raised his eyes to Spade 's mouth and spoke in the strained voice of one in physical pain : " Keep on riding me and you 're going to be picking iron out of your navel . " Spade chuckled . " The cheaper the crook , the gaudier the patter , " he said cheerfully . " Well , let 's go . " They walked up Sutter Street side by side . The boy kept his hands in his overcoat-pockets . They walked ap145little more than a block in silence . Then Spade asked pleasantly : " How long have you been off the gooseberrylay , son ? " The boy did not show that he had heard the question . " Did you ever  --  ? " Spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glow in his yellowish eyes . He did not address the boy again . They went into the Alexandria , rode up to the twelfth floor , and walked down the corridor towards Gutman 's suite . Nobody else was in the corridor . Spade lagged a little , so that , when they were within fifteen feet of Gutman 's door , he was perhaps a foot and a half behind the boy . He leaned sidewise suddenly andrasped the boy from behind by both arms , just beneath lie boy 's elbows . He forced the boy 's arms forward o that the boy 's hands , in his overcoat-pockets , lifted lie overcoat up before him . The boy struggled and squirmed , but he was impotent in the big man 's grip . ' file boy kicked back , but his feet went between Spade 's spread legs . Spade lifted the boy straight up from the floor and brought him down hard on his feet again . The impact trade little noise on the thick carpet . At the moment of impact Spade 's hands slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrists . The boy , teeth set hard together , did of stop straining against the man 's big hands , but he ould not tear himself loose , could not keep the man 's ands from crawling down over his own hands . The boy 's teeth ground together audibly , making a noise that mingled with the noise of Spade 's breathing as Spade crushed the boy 's hands . They were tense and motionless for a long moment ,  | Then the boy 's arms became limp . Spade released the boy and stepped back . In each of Spade 's hands , when they came out of the boy 's overcoat-pockets , there was a heavy automatic pistol . The boy turned and faced Spade . The boy 's face was a ghastly white blank . He kept his hands in his overcoatpockets . He looked at Spade 's chest and did not say anything . Spade put the pistols in his own pockets and grinned derisively . " Come on , " he said . " This will put you in solid with your boss . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .   GUTMAN opened the door . A glad smile lighted his fat face . He held out a hand and said : " Ah , come in , i r ! Thank you for coming . Come in . " Spade shook the hand and entered . The boy went in behind him . The fat man shut the door . Spade took t lie boy 's pistols from his pockets and held them out to Gutman . " Here . You should n't let him run around with I liese . He 'll get himself hurt . " The fat man laughed merrily and took the pistols . " Well , well , " he said , " what 's this ? " He looked from Spade to the boy . Spade said : " A crippled newsie took them away from him , but I made him give them back . " The white-faced boy took the pistols out of Gutman 's hands and pocketed them . The boy did not speak . Gutman laughed again . " By Gad , sir , " he told Spade , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ character . Come in . Sit down . Give me your hat . " The boy left the room by the door to the right of the entrance . The fat man installed Spade in a green plush chair by the table , pressed a cigar upon him , held a light to i t , mixed whiskey and carbonated water , put one glass in Spade 's hand , and , holding the other , sat down facing Spade . 148 THE MALTESE FALCON " Now , sir , " he said , " I hope you 'll let me apologize for  --  " " Never mind that , " Spade said . " Let 's talk about the black bird . " The fat man cocked his head to the left and regarded Spade with fond eyes . " All right , sir , " he agreed . " Let 's . " He took a sip from the glass in his hand . " This is going to be the most astounding thing you 've ever heard of , sir , and I say that knowing that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some astounding things in his time . " Spade nodded politely . The fat man screwed up his eyes and asked : " What do you know , sir , about the Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem , later called the Knights of Rhodes and other things ? " Spade waved his cigar . " Not much  --  only what I remember from history in school  --  Crusaders or some-thing . " " Very good . Now you do n't remember that Suleiman the Magnificent chased them out of Rhodes in 1523 ? " " No . " " Well , sir , he did , and they settled in Crete . And they stayed there for seven years , until 1530 when they per suaded the Emperor Charles V to give them "  --  Gutman held up three puffy fingers and counted them  --  " Malta : Gozo , and Tripoli . " " Yes ? " " Yes , sir , but with these conditions : they were to pay the Emperor each year the tribute of one "  --  he held up a finger  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and if they ever left the island it wasP149to revert to Spain . Understand ? He was giving it to t hem , but not unless they used it , and they could n't give or sell it to anybody else . " " Yes . " The fat man looked over his shoulders at the three closed doors , hunched his chair a few inches nearer Spade 's , and reduced his voice to a husky whisper : " Have you any conception of the extreme , the immeasurable , wealth of the Order at that time ? " " If I remember , " Spade said , " they were pretty well fixed . " Gutman smiled indulgently . " Pretty well , sir , is puttingit mildly . " His whisper became lower and more purring . " They were rolling in wealth , sir . You 've no idea . None of us has any idea . For years they had preyed on the Saracens , had taken nobody knows what spoils of gems , precious metals , silks , ivories  --  the cream of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We all know that t lie Holy Wars to them , as to the Templars , were largely it matter of loot . " Well , now , the Emperor Charles has given them Malta , and all the rent he asks is one insignificant bird per annum , just as a matter of form . What could be more natural than for these immeasurably wealthy Knights to look around for some way of expressing their gratitude ? Well , sir , that 's exactly what they did , and hey hit on the happy thought of sending Charles for the first year 's tribute , not an insignificant live bird , butu glorious golden falcon encrusted from head to foot with the finest jewels in their coffers . And  --  remember , sir  --  they had fine ones , the finest out of Asia . " Gutman stopped whispering . His sleek dark eyes examinedp150Spade 's face , which was placid . The fat man asked : " Well , sir , what do you think of that ? " " I do n't know . " The fat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ facts , not schoolbook history , not Mr. Wells 's history , but history nevertheless . " He leaned forward . " The archives of the Order from the twelfth century on are still at Malta . They are not intact , but what is there holds no less than three "  --  he held up three fingers  --  " references that ca n't be to anything else but this jeweled falcon . In J. Delaville Le Roulx 's Les Archives de l'Ordre de Saint-Jean there is a reference to it  --  oblique to be sure , but a reference still . And the unpublished  --  becauseunfinished at the time of his death  --  supplement to Paoli 's Dell ' origin ed instituto del sacro militar ordine has a clear and unmistakable statement of the facts I am telling you . " " All right , " Spade said . " All right , sir . Grand Master Villiers de l'Isle d'Adam had this foot-high jeweled bird made by Turkish slaves in the castle of St. Angelo and sent it to Charles , who was in Spain . He sent it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Corvere , a member of the Order . " His voice dropped to a whisper again . " It never reached Spain . " He smiled with compressed lips and asked : " You know of Barbarossa , Redbeard , Khaired-Din ? No ? A famous admiral of buccaneers sailing out of Algiers then . Well , sir , he took the Knights ' galley and he took the bird . The bird went to Algiers . That 's a fact . That 's a fact that the French historian Pierre Dan put in one of his letters from Algiers . He wrote that tlibird had been there for more than a hundred years , untilp151it was carried away by Sir Francis Verney , the English adventurer who was with the Algerian buccaneers for a while . Maybe it was n't , but Pierre Dan believed it was , and that 's good enough for me . " There 's nothing said about the bird in Lady Frances Verney 's Memoirs of the Verney Family during the Seventeenth Century , to be sure . I looked . And it 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he died in a Messina hospital in 1615 . He was stony broke . But , sir , there 's no denying that the bird did go to Sicily . It was there and it came into the possessionthere of Victor Amadeus II some time after he became king in 1713 , and it was one of his gifts to his wife when he married in Chambery after abdicating . That is a fact , sir . Carutti , the author of Storia del Regno di Vittorio Amadeo II , himself vouched for it . " Maybe they  --  Amadeo and his wife  --  took it along with them to Turin when he tried to revoke his abdication . Be that as it may , it turned up next in the possession of a Spaniard who had been with the army that took Naples in 1734  --  the father of Don Jose Monino y Redondo , Count of Floridablanca , who was Charles III 's chief minister . There 's nothing to show that it did n't stay in that family until at least the end of the Carlist War in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the time that Paris was full of Carlists who had had to get out of Spain . One of them must have brought it with him , but , whoever he was , it 's likely he knew nothing about its real value . It had been  --  no doubt as a precaution during the Carlist trouble in Spain  --  painted or enameled over to look like nothing more than a fairly interesting black statuette . And in that disguise ,  |p152sir  , it was , you might say , kicked around Paris for seventyyears by private owners and dealers too stupid to see what it was under the skin . " The fat man paused to smile and shake his head regretfully . Then he went on : " For seventy years , sir , this marvelous item was , as you might say , a football in the gutters of Paris  --  until 1911 when a Greek dealer named Charilaos Konstantinides found it in an obscure shop . It did n't take Charilaos long to learn what it was and to acquire it . No thickness of enamel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir , Charilaos was the man who traced most of its history and who identified it as what it actually was . I got wind of it and finally forced most of the history out of him , though I 've been able to add a few details since . " Charilaos was in no hurry to convert his find into money at once . He knew that  --  enormous as its intrinsic value was  --  a far higher , a terrific , price could be obtainedfor it once its authenticity was established beyonddoubt . Possibly he planned to do business with one of the modern descendents of the old Order  --  the EnglishOrder of St. John of Jerusalem , the Prussian Johanniterorden , or the Italian or German langues of the Sovereign Order of Malta  --  all wealthy orders . " The fat man raised his glass , smiled at its emptiness , and rose to fill it and Spade 's . " You begin to believe me a little ? " he asked as he worked the siphon . " I have n't said I did n't . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how you looked . " He sat down , drank generously , and patted his mouth with a white handkerchief . " Well , sir , to hold it safe while pursuing his researches into its history , Charilaos hadP153-enamelled the bird , apparently just as it is now . One ear to the very day after he had acquired it  --  that was ssibly three months after I 'd made him confess to me I picked up the Times in London and read that his establishment had been burglarized and him murdered . was in Paris the next day . " He shook his head sadly . The bird was gone . By Gad , sir , I was wild . I did n't . lieve anybody else knew what it was . I did n't believe e had told anybody but me . A great quantity of stuff ad been stolen . That made me think that the thief hadply taken the bird along with the rest of his plunder , , 0t. knowing what it was . Because I assure you that a ! lief who knew its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sir  --  at least not anything less than rown jewels . " Ile shut his eyes and smiled complacently at an inner thought . He opened his eyes and said : " That was seven - . en years ago . Well , sir , it took me seventeen years to mate that bird , but I did it . I wanted it , and I 'm notroan that 's easily discouraged when he wants somehing . " His smile grew broad . " I wanted it and I found r t . I want it and I 'm going to have it . " He drained his glass , dried his lips again , and returned his handkerhiefto his pocket . " I traced it to the home of a Russian eneral  --  one Kemidov  --  in a Constantinople suburb . le did n't know a thing about it . It was nothing but a lack enameled figure to him , but his natural contrariess  --  thenatural contrariness of a Russian generalepthim from selling it to me when I made him an offer . erhaps in my eagerness I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know about that . But I did know I wanted it and I was afraid this stupid soldier might begin to investigate his property , might chip off some of the enamel . So I sent some  --  ah  --  agents to get it . Well , sir , they got it and I have n't got it . " He stood up and carried his empty glass to the table . " But I 'm going to get it . Your glass , sir . " " Then the bird does n't belong to any of you ? " Spade asked , " but to a General Kemidov ? " " Belong ? " the fat man said jovially . " Well , sir , yo might say it belonged to the King of Spain , but I don ' see how you can honestly grant anybody else clear titl to it  --  except by right of possession . " He clucked . " An article of that value that has passed from hand to hand by such means is clearly the property of whoever can get hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's now ? " " No , sir , except as my agent . " Spade said , " Oh , " ironically . Gutman , looking thoughtfully at the stopper of the whiskey-bottle in his hand , asked : " There 's no doubt that she 's got it now ? " " Not much . " " Where ? " " I do n't know exactly . " The fat man set the bottle on the table with a bang . " But you said you did , " he protested . Spade made a careless gesture with one hand . " I meant to say I know where to get it when the time comes . " The pink bulbs of Gutman 's face arranged themselves more happily . " And you do ? " he asked . " Yes . " " Where ? " P155Spade grinned and said : " Leave that to me . That 's my end . " " When ? " " When I 'm ready . " The fat man pursed his lips and , smiling with only slight uneasiness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now ? " " In my hands , safely tucked away . " Gutman smiled with approval . " Trust you for that , Mir , " he said . " Well now , sir , before we sit down to talk prices , answer me this : how soon can you  --  or how soon are you willing to  --  produce the falcon ? " " A couple of days . " The fat man nodded . " That is satisfactory . We -- But I forget our nourishment . " He turned to the table , poured whiskey , squirted charged water into it , set a glass at Spade 's elbow and held his own aloft . " Well , sir , here 's to a fair bargain and profits large enough for both of us . " They drank . The fat man sat down . Spade asked : " What 's your idea of a fair bargain ? " Gutman held his glass up to the light , looked affectionatelyat it , took another long drink , and said : " I have two proposals to make , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I will give you twenty-five thousand dollars when you deliver the falcon to me , and another twentylivethousand as soon as I get to New York ; or I will give you one quarter  --  twenty-five per cent  --  of what I realize on the falcon . There you are , sir : an almost immediatefifty thousand dollars or a vastly greater sum within , say , a couple of months . " Spade drank and asked : " How much greater ? "  | " Vastly , " the fat man repeated . " Who knows how much greater ? Shall I say a hundred thousand , or a quarter of a million ? Will you believe me if I name the sum that seems the probable minimum ? " " Why not ? " The fat man smacked his lips and lowered his voice t to a purring murmur . " What would you say , sir , to ' half a million ? " Spade narrowed his eyes . " Then you think the dingus is worth two million ? " Gutman smiled serenely . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spade emptied his glass and set it on the table . He put his cigar in his mouth , took it out , looked at it , and put it back in . His yellow-grey eyes were faintly muddy . He said : " That 's a hell of a lot of dough . " The fat man agreed : " That 's a hell of a lot of dough . " He leaned forward and patted Spade 's knee . " That is the absolute rock-bottom minimum  --  or Charilaos Konstantinideswas a blithering idiot  --  and he was n't . " Spade removed the cigar from his mouth again , frowned at it with distaste , and put it on the smoking .. stand . He shut his eyes hard , opened them again . Their muddiness had thickened . He said : " The  --  the minimum , hull ? And the maximum ? " An unmistakable sh followed the x in maximum as he said it . " The maximum ? " Gutman held his empty hand out , palm up . " I refuse to guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . There 's no telling how high it could go , sir , and that 's the one and only truth about it . " Spade pulled his sagging lower lip tight against the upper . He shook his head impatiently . A sharp fright-P157cued gleam awoke in his eyes  --  and was smothered by the deepening muddiness . He stood up , helping himself up with his hands on the arms of his chair . He shook his head again and took an uncertain step forward . He laughed thickly and muttered : " God damn you . " Gutman jumped up and pushed his chair back . 1E4 fat globes jiggled . His eyes were dark holes in an oily pink face . Spade swung his head from side to side until his dull eyes were pointed at  --  if not focused on  --  the door . He took another uncertain step . The fat man called sharply : " Wilmer ! " A door opened and the boy came in . Spade took a third step . His face was grey now , with jaw-muscles standing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not straighten again after his fourth step and his muddy eyes were almost covered by their lids . Ile took his fifth step . The boy walked over and stood close to Spade , a little in front of him , but not directly between Spade and the door . The boy 's right hand was inside his coat over his heart . The corners of his mouth twitched . Spade essayed his sixth step . The boy 's leg darted out across Spade 's leg , in front . Spade tripped over the interfering leg and crashed facedownon the floor . The boy , keeping his right hand under his coat , looked down at Spade . Spade tried to get up . ' rhe boy drew his right foot far back and kicked Spade 's temple . The kick rolled Spade over on his side . Once more he tried to get up , could not , and went to sleep.  | SPADE , coming around the corner from the elevator at a few minutes past six in the morning , saw yellow light glowing through the frosted glass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lips together , looked up and down the corridor , and advanced to the door with swift quiet strides . He put his hand on the knob and turned it with care that permitted neither rattle nor click . He turned the knob until it would turn no farther : the door was locked . Holding the knob still , he changed hands , taking it now in his left hand . With his right hand he brought his keys out of his pocket , carefully , so they could not jingle against one another . He separated the office-key from the others and , smothering the others together in his palm , inserted the office-key in the lock . The insertion was soundless . He balanced himself on the balls of hiss feet , filled his lungs , clicked the door open , and went in . Effie Perine sat sleeping with her head on her forearms , her forearms on her desk . She wore her coat and ! had one of Spade 's overcoats wrapped cape-fashion around her . Spade blew his breath out in a muffled laugh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the inner door . The inner office was empty . He went over to the girl and put a hand on her shoulder . P159She stirred , raised her head drowsily , and her eyelids fluttered . Suddenly she sat up straight , opening her eyes wide . She saw Spade , smiled , leaned back in her chat : , and rubbed her eyes with her fingers . " So you finally got back ? " she said . " What time is it ? " " Six o'clock . What are you doing here ? " She shivered , drew Spade 's overcoat closer around her , and yawned . " You told me to stay till you got back or phoned . " " Oh , you 're the sister of the boy who stood on the burning deck ? " " I was n't going to  --  " She broke off and stood up , letting his coat slide down on the chair behind her . She looked with dark excited eyes at his temple under the brim of his hat and exclaimed : " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was dark and swollen . " I do n't know whether I fell or was slugged . I do n't think it amounts to much , but it hurts like hell . " He barely touched it with his fingers , flinched , turned his grimace into a grim smile , and explained : " I went visiting , was fed knockout-drops , and came to twelve hours later all spread out on a man 's floor . " She reached up and removed his hat from his head . " It 's terrible , " she said . " You 'll have to get a doctor . You ca n't walk around with a head like that . " " It 's not as bad as it looks , except for the headache , and that might be mostly from the drops . " He went to the cabinet in the corner of the office and ran cold water on a handkerchief . " Anything turn up after I left ? " " Did you find Miss O'Shaughnessy , Sam ? " " Not yet . Anything turn up after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ office phoned . He wants to see you . " " Himself ? " " Yes , that 's the way I understood it . And a boy came in with , a message  --  that Mr. Gutman would be delighted to talk to you before five-thirty . " Spade turned off the water , squeezed the handkerchief , and came away from the cabinet holding the handkerchief to his temple . " I got that , " he said . " I met the boy downstairs , and talking to Mr. Gutman got me this . " " Is that the G. who phoned , Sam ? " " Yes . " " And what  --  ? " Spade stared through the girl and spoke as if using speech to arrange his thoughts : " He wants something he thinks I can get . I persuaded him I could keep him from getting it if he did n't make the deal with me before five-thirty . Then  --  uh-huh  --  sure -- it was after I 'd told him he 'd have to wait a couple of days that he fed me the junk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 'd know I 'd be up and around in ten or twelve hours . So maybe the answer 's that he figured he could get it without my , help in that time if I was fixed so I could n't butt in . " He scowled . " I hope to Christ he was wrong . " His stare becameless distant . " You did n't get any word from the O'Shaughnessy ? " The girl shook her head no and asked : " Has this got anything to do with her ? " " Something . " " This thing he wants belongs to her ? " " Or to the King of Spain . Sweetheart , you 've got anP161uncle who teaches history or something over at the University ? " " A cousin . Why ? " " If we brightened his life with an alleged historical secret four centuries old could we trust him to keep it ( lark awhile ? " " Oh , yes , he 's good people . " " Fine . Get your pencil and book . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more told water on his handkerchief and , holding it to his temple , stood in front of her and dictated the story of the falcon as he had heard it from Gutman , from Charles V 's grant to the Hospitallers up to  --  but no further than  --  the enameled bird 's arrival in Paris at the time of the Carlist influx . He stumbled over the names of authors and their works that Gutman had mentioned , but managed to achieve some sort of phonetic likeness . The rest of the history he repeated with the accuracy of a trained interviewer . When he had finished the girl shut her notebook and raised a flushed smiling face to him . " Oh , is n't this thrilling ? " she said . " It 's  --  " " Yes , or ridiculous . Now will you take it over and read it to your cousin and ask him what he thinks of it ? Has he ever run across anything that might have some connection with it ? Is it probable ? Is it possible  --  even barely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants more time to look it up , 0 K , but get some sort of opinionout of him now . And for God 's sake make him keep it under his hat . " " I 'll go right now , " she said , " and you go see a doctor about that head . "  | " We 'll have breakfast first . " " No , I 'll eat over in Berkeley . I ca n't wait to hear what Ted thinks of this . " " Well , " Spade said , " do n't start boo-hooing if lie laughs at you . " After a leisurely breakfast at the Palace , during which he read both morning papers , Spade went home , shaved , bathed , rubbed ice on his bruised temple , and put on fresh clothes . He went to Brigid O'Shaughnessy 's apartment at the Coronet . Nobody was in the apartment . Nothing had been changed in it since his last visit . He went to the Alexandria Hotel . Gutman was not in . None of the other occupants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these other occupants were the fat man 's secretary , Wilmer Cook , and his daughter Rhea , a brown-eyed fair-haired smallish girl of seventeenwhom the hotel-staff said was beautiful . Spade was told that the Gutman party had arrived at the hotel , from New York , ten days before , and had not checked out . Spade went to the Belvedere and found the hoteldetectiveeating in the hotel-cafe . " Morning , Sam . Set down and bite an egg . " The hotel-detective stared at Spade 's temple . " By God , somebody mated you plenty ! " " Thanks , I 've had mine , " Spade said as he sat down , and then , referring to his temple : " It looks worse than it is . How 's my Cairo 's conduct ? " " He went out not more than half an hour behind youp163yesterday and I ai n't seen him since . He did n't sleep here again last night . " " He 's getting bad habits . " " Well , a fellow like that alone in a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Sam ? " " It was n't Cairo . " Spade looked attentively at the . stall silver dome covering Luke 's toast . " How 's chances of giving his room a casing while he 's out ? " " Can do . You know I 'm willing to go all the way with you all the time . " Luke pushed his coffee back , put his elbows on the table , and screwed up his eyes at Spade . " But I got a hunch you ai n't going all the way with me . What 's the honest-to-God on this guy , Sam ? You do n't have to kick back on me . You know I 'm regular . " Spade lifted his eyes from the silver dome . They were clear and candid . " Sure , you are , " he said . " I 'm not holding out . I gave you it straight . I 'm doing a job for him , im , but he 's got some friends that look wrong to me and I 'm a little leery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yesterday was one of his friends . " " Yes , Luke , he was . " " And it was one of them that shoved Miles across . " Spade shook his head . " Thursby killed Miles . " " And who killed him ? " Spade smiled . " That 's supposed to be a secret , but , confidentially , I did , " he said , " according to the police . " Luke grunted and stood up saying : " You 're a tough one to figure out , Sam . Come on , we 'll have that look Nee . " They stopped at the desk long enough for Luke to " fix it so we 'll get a ring if he comes in , " and went up to Cairo 's room . Cairo 's bed was smooth and trim , but paper in wastebasket , unevenly drawn blinds , and a couple of rumpled towels in the bathroom showed that the chambermaid had not yet been in that morning . Cairo 's luggage consisted of a square trunk , a valise , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cosmetics  --  boxes , cans , jars , and bottles of powders , creams , ungents , perfumes , lotions , and tonics . Two suits and an overcoat hung in the closet over three pairs of carefully treed shoes . The valise and smaller bag were unlocked . Luke had the trunk unlocked by the time Spade had finished searching elsewhere . " Blank so far , " Spade said as they dug down into the trunk . They found nothing there to interest them . " Any particular thing we 're supposed to be looking for ? " Luke asked as he locked the trunk again . " No . He 's supposed to have come here from Constantinople . I 'd like to know if he did . I have n't seen anything that says he did n't . " " What 's his racket ? " Spade shook his head . " That 's something else I 'd like to know . " He crossed the room and bent down over the wastebasket . " Well , this is our last shot . " He took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was the previous day 's Call . It was folded with the **27;90;TOOLONG outside . He opened it , examined that page , and nothing there stopped his eyes . He turned the paper over and looked at the pageP165that had been folded inside , the page that held financial and shipping news , the weather , births , marriages , divorces , and deaths . From the lower left-hand corner , a little more than two inches of the bottom of the second column had been torn out . Immediately above the tear was a small caption ArrivedToday followed by : 12 : 20 A. M.  --  Capac from Astoria. 5 : 05 A. M.  --  Helen P. Drew from Greenwood . 5 : 06 A. M.  --  Albarado from Bandon . The tear passed through the next line , leaving only enough of its letters to make from Sydney inferable . Spade put the Call down on the desk and looked into the wastebasket again . He found a small piece of wrapping-paper , a piece of string , two hosiery tags , a haberdasher'ssale-ticket for half a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the basket , a piece of newspaper rolled into a tiny ball . He opened the ball carefully , smoothed it out on the desk , and fitted it into the torn part of the Call . The fit at the sides was exact , but between the top of the crumpledfragment and the inferable from Sydney half an inch was missing , sufficient space to have held announcement of six or seven boats ' arrival . He turned the sheet over and saw that the other side of the missing portion could have held only a meaningless corner of a **26;119;TOOLONG . Luke , leaning over his shoulder , asked : " What 's this all about ? " " Looks like the gent 's interested in a boat . "   " Well , there 's no law against that , or is there ? " Luke said while Spade was folding the torn page and the crumpled fragment together and putting them into his coat-pocket . " You all through here now ? " " Yes . Thanks a lot , Luke . Will you give me a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sure . " Spade went to the Business Office of the Call , bought a copy of the previous day 's issue , opened it to the shipping-news-page , and compared it with the page taken from Cairo 's wastebasket . The missing portion had read : 5 : 17 A.m.  --  Tahiti from Sydney and Papeete. 6 : 05 Am.  --  Admiral Peoples from Astoria . S : 07 A. M.  --  Caddopeak from San Pedro . 8 : 17 AM.  --  Silverad.o from San Pedro. 8 : 05 AM.  --  La Paloma from Hongkong. 9 : 03 AM.  --  Daisy Gray from Seattle . He read the list slowly and when he had finished he underscored Hongkong with a fingernail , cut the list of arrivals from the paper with his pocket-knife , put the rest of the paper and Cairo 's sheet into the wastebasket , and returned to his office .

Hell with your Saturday afternoon golf : your job 's to keep me out of jail . . . . Right , Sid . ' Bye . " He pushed the telephone away , yawned , stretched , felt his bruised temple , looked at his watch , and rolled and lighted a cigarette . He smoked sleepily until Effie Perine came in . Effie Perine came in smiling , bright-eyed and rosyfaced . " Ted says it could be , " she reported , " and he hopes it is . He says he 's not a specialist in that field , but the names and dates are all right , and at least none of your authorities or their works are out-and-out fakes He 's all excited over it . "   " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too enthusiasticto see through it if it 's phoney . " " Oh , he would n't  --  not Ted ! He 's too good at his stuff for that . " " Uh-huh , the whole damned Perine family 's wonderful , " Spade said , " including you and the smudge of soot on your nose . " " He 's not a Perine , he 's a Christy . " She bent her head to look at her nose in her vanity-case-mirror . " I must 've got that from the fire . " She scrubbed the smudge with the corner of a handkerchief . " The Perine-Christy enthusiasm ignite Berkeley ? " he asked . She made a face at him while patting her nose with a powdered pink disc . " There was a boat on fire when I came back . They were towing it out from the pier and the smoke blew all over our ferry-boat . " Spade put his hands on the arms of his chair . " Were you near enough to see the name of the boat ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade smiled ruefully . " I 'm damned if I know why , sister , " he said .   SPADE and Detective-sergeant Polhaus ate pickled pigs ' feet at one of big John 's tables at the States Hof Brau . Polhaus , balancing pale bright jelly on a fork half , way between plate and mouth , said : " Hey , listen , Sam ! Forget about the other night . He was dead wrong , but you know anybody 's liable to lose their head if you ride them thataway . " Spade looked thoughtfully at the police-detective . " Was that what you wanted to see me about ? " he asked . Polhaus nodded , put the forkful of jelly into hismouth , swallowed it , and qualified his nod : " Mostly . " " Dundy send you ? " Polhaus made a disgusted mouth . " You know he did n't . He 's as bullheaded as you are . " Spade smiled and shook his head . " No , he 's not , Tom , " he said . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his pig 's foot with a knife . " Ai n't you ever going to grow up ? " he grumbled . " What 've you got to beef about ? He did n't hurt you . You came out on top . What 's the sense of making a grudge of it ? You 're just making a lot of grief for your-self . " Spade placed his knife and fork carefully together on his plate , and put his hands on the table beside his plate . His smile was faint and devoid of warmth . " Wit ! every bull in town working overtime trying to pile u grief for me a little more wo n't hurt . I wo n't even know it 's there . " Polhaus 's ruddiness deepened . He said : " That 's a swell thing to say to me . " Spade picked up his knife and fork and began to eat . Polhaus ate . Presently Spade asked : " See the boat on fire in the bay ? " " I saw the smoke . Be reasonable , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why do n't you let it go at that ? " " Think I ought to go around and tell him I hope my chin did n't hurt his fist ? " Polhaus cut savagely into his pig 's foot . Spade said : " Phil Archer been in with any more hot tips ? " " Aw , hell ! Dundy did n't think you shot Miles , but what else could he do except run the lead down ? You'd 've done the same thing in his place , and you know it . " " Yes ? " Malice glittered in Spade 's eyes . " What made him think I did n't do it ? What makes you think I did n't ? Or do n't you ? " Polhaus 's ruddy face flushed again . He said : " Thursby shot Miles . " " You think he did . " " He did . That Webley was his , and the slug in Miles came out of it . " " Sure ? " Spade demanded . " Dead sure , " the police-detective replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bellhop at Thursby 's hotel  --  that hadp171wen it in his room just that morning . He noticed it parrticular because he 'd never saw one just like it before . I never saw one . You say they do n't make them any more . It ai n't likely there 'd be another around andanyway  --  ifthat was n't Thursby 's what happened to his ? And that 's the gun the slug in Miles come out of . " He started to put a piece of bread into his mouth , withdrewit , and asked : " You say you 've seen them before : where was that at ? " He put the bread into his mouth . " In England before the war . " " Sure , there you are . " Spade nodded and said : " Then that leaves Thursby t Ile only one I killed . " Polhaus squirmed in his chair and his face was red and shiny . " Christ 's sake , ai n't you never going to forgetthat ? " he complained earnestly . " That 's out . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd think you was n't a dick yourself the way you bellyache over things . I suppose you do n't never pull the same stuff on anybody that we pulled on you ? " " You mean that you tried to pull on me , Tom  --  just l vied . " Polhaus swore under his breath and attacked the remainder of his pig 's foot . Spade said : " All right . You know it 's out and I knoll it 's out . What does Dundy know ? " " He knows it 's out . " " What woke him up ? " " Aw , Sam , he never really thought you 'd  --  " Spade 's smile checked Polhaus . He left the sentence incomplete and said : " We dug up a record on Thursby . " " Yes ? Who was he ? "  | Polhaus 's shrewd small brown eyes studied Spade 's face . Spade exclaimed irritably : " I wish to God I knew half as much about this business as you smart guys think I do ! " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , he was a St. Louis gunman the first we hear of him . He was picked up a lot of times back there for this and that , but he belonged to the Egan mob , so nothing much was ever done about any of it . I do n't know howcome he left that shelter , but they got him once in New York for knocking over a row of stuss-games  --  his twist turned him up  --  and he was in a year before Fallon got him sprung . A couple of years later he did a short hitch in Joliet for pistol-whipping another twist that had given him the needle , but after that he took up with Dixie Monahan and did n't have any trouble getting out whenever he happened to get in . That was when Dixie was almost as big a shot as Nick the Greek in Chicago gambling . This Thursby was Dixie 's bodyguard and he took the run-out with him when Dixie got in wrong with the rest of the boys over some debts he could n't or would n't pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the time the Newport Beach Boating Club was shut up . I do n't know if Dixie had any part in that . Anyways , this is the first time him or Thursby 's been seen since . " " Dixie 's been seen ? " Spade asked . Polhaus shook his head . " No . " His small eyes became sharp , prying . " Not unless you 've seen him or know somebody 's seen him . " Spade lounged back in his chair and began to makep173a cigarette . " I have n't , " he said mildly . " This is all new tuff to me . " " I guess it is , " Polhaus snorted . Spade grinned at him and asked : " Where 'd you pick tip all this news about Thursby ? " " Some of it 's on the records . The rest  --  well --  -- we got ' t. here and there . " " From Cairo , for instance ? " Now Spade 's eyes held he prying gleam . Polhaus put down his coffee-cup and shook his head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that guy for us . " Spade laughed . " You mean a couple of high-class sleuths like you and Dundy worked on that lily-of-the -- valley all night and could n't crack him ? " " What do you mean  --  all night ? " Polhaus protested . " We worked on him for less than a couple of hours . We haw we was n't getting nowhere , and let him go . " Spade laughed again and looked at his watch . He caught John 's eye and asked for the check . " I 've got a elate with the D. A. this afternoon , " he told Polhaus while they waited for his change . " He send for you ? " " Yes . " Polhaus pushed his chair back and stood up , a barrelbelliedtall man , solid and phlegmatic . " You wo n't be doing me any favor , " he said , " by telling him I 've talked to you like this . " A lathy youth with salient ears ushered Spade into the District Attorney 's office . Spade went in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! "  | District Attorney Bryan stood up and held his hand out across his desk . He was a blond man of medium stature , perhaps forty-five years old , with aggressive blue eyes behind black-ribboned nose-glasses , the over-large ! mouth of an orator , and a wide dimpled chin . When he said , " How do you do , Spade ? " his voice was resonant with latent power . They shook hands and sat down . The District Attorney put his finger on one of the pearl buttons in a battery of four on his desk , said to ' the lathy youth who opened the door again , " Ask Mr. Thomas and Healy to come in , " and then , rocking back . in his chair , addressed Spade pleasantly : " You and the police have n't been hitting it off so well , have you ? " Spade made a negligent gesture with the fingers of his right hand . " Nothing serious , " he said lightly " Dundy gets too enthusiastic . " The door opened to admit two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hello , Thomas ! " was a sunburned stocky man of thirty in clothing and hair of a kindred unruliness . He clapped Spade on the shoulder with freckled hand , asked , " How 's tricks ? " and sat down beside him . The second man was younger and colorless . He took a seat a little apart from the others and balanceda stenographer 's notebook on his knee , holding a green pencil over it . Spade glanced his way , chuckled , and asked Bryan : f " Anything I say will be used against me ? " The District Attorney smiled . " That always holds good . " He took his glasses off , looked at them , and set them on his nose again . He looked through them at Spade and asked : " Who killed Thursby ? "  |p175S|pade  said : " I do n't know . " Bryan rubbed his black eyeglass-ribbon between thumb and fingers and said knowingly : " Perhaps youdo n't , but you certainly could make an excellent guess . " " Maybe , but I would n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't , " Spade repeated . He was serene . " My ' less might be excellent , or it might be crummy , but rs . Spade did n't raise any children dippy enough to ake guesses in front of a district attorney , an assistant district attorney , and a stenographer . " " Why should n't you , if you 've nothing to conceal ? " " Everybody , " Spade responded mildly , " has some- ! ling to conceal . " " And you have  --  ? " " My guesses , for one thing . " The District Attorney looked down at his desk and lien up at Spade . He settled his glasses more firmly on 1 is nose . He said : " If you 'd prefer not having the stenographerhere we can dismiss him . It was simply as a tatter of convenience that I brought him in " " I do n't mind him a damned bit , " Spade replied . " I 'm willing to have anything I say put down and I 'm willing to sign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sign anything , " Bryan assured him . " I wish you would n't regard this as a formal inquiry at all . And please do n't think I 've any belief  --  much less confidence  --  in those theories the police seem to have formed . " " No ? " " Not a particle . " Spade sighed and crossed his legs . " I 'm glad of that . "   He felt in his pockets for tobacco and papers . " What 's your theory ? " Bryan leaned forward in his chair and his eyes were hard and shiny as the lenses over them . " Tell me who Archer was shadowing Thursby for and I 'll tell you who killed Thursby . " Spade 's laugh was brief and scornful . " You 're as wrong as Dundy , " he said . " Do n't misunderstand me , Spade , " Bryan said , knocking on the desk with his knuckles . " I do n't say your client killed Thursby or had him killed , but I do say that , knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mighty soon know who killed Thursby . " Spade lighted his cigarette , removed it from his lips , emptied his lungs of smoke , and spoke as if puzzled : " I do n't exactly get that . " " You do n't ? Then suppose I put it this way : where is Dixie Monahan ? " Spade 's face retained its puzzled look . " Putting it i that way does n't help much , " he said . " I still do n't get it . " The District Attorney took his glasses off and shoo them for emphasis . He said : " We know Thursby was Monahan 's bodyguard and went with him when Monahanfound it wise to vanish from Chicago . We know Monahan welshed on something like **27;147;TOOLONG ' worth of bets when he vanished . We do n't know  --  not yet  --  who his creditors were . " He put the glasses on again and smiled grimly . " But we all know what 's likely to happen to a gambler who welshes , and to his bodyguard , when his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p177S|pade  ran his tongue over his lips and pulled his lips hack over his teeth in an ugly grin . His eyes glittered under pulled-down brows . His reddening neck bulged over the rim of his collar . His voice was low and hoarse and passionate . " Well , what do you think ? IDid I kill h i m n for his creditors ? Or just find him and let them do I heir own killing ? " " No , no ! " the District Attorney protested . " You misunderstand me . " " I hope to Christ I do , " Spade said . " He did n't mean that , " Thomas said . " Then what did he mean ? " Bryan waved a hand . " I only mean that you might have been involved in it without knowing what it was . That could  --  " " I see , " Spade sneered . " You do n't think I 'm naughty . You just think I 'm dumb . " " Nonsense , " Bryan insisted : " Suppose someone came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you they had reasons for thinking he was in the city . The someone might give you a completely false story  --  any one of a dozen or more would do  --  or might say he was a debtor who had run away , without giving you any of t lie details . How could you tell what was behind it ? How would you know it was n't an ordinary piece of detective work ? And under those circumstances you certainly could n't be held responsible for your part in it unless " - his voice sank to a more impressive key and his words came out spaced and distinct  --  " you made yourself an accomplice by concealing your knowledge of the murderer'sidentity or information that would lead to his ap-prehension. "  |p178Anger  was leaving Spade 's face . No anger remained in his voice when he asked : " That 's what you meant ? " " Precisely . " " All right . Then there 's no hard feelings . But you 're wrong . " " Prove it . " Spade shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell you . " " Then tell me . " " Nobody ever hired me to do anything about Dixi Monahan . " Bryan and Thomas exchanged glances . Bryan 's eye came back to Spade and he said : " But , by your ow admission , somebody did hire you to do something abou his bodyguard Thursby . " " Yes , about his ex-bodyguard Thursby . " " Ex ? " " Yes , ex . " " You know that Thursby was no longer associate  --  with Monahan ? You know that positively ? " Spade stretched out his hand and dropped the stub. of his cigarette into an ashtray on the desk . He spok carelessly : " I do n't know anything positively excep that my client was n't interested in Monahan , had neve been interested in Monahan . I heard that Thursby took Monahan out to the Orient and lost him . " Again the District Attorney and his assistant exchangedglances . Thomas , in a tone whose matter-of-factness did not quite hide excitement , said : " That opens another angle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ditching Monahan. "  | " Dead gamblers do n't have any friends , " Spade said . " It opens up two new lines , " Bryan said . He leaned back and stared at the ceiling for several seconds , then at upright quickly . His orator 's face was alight . " It arrows down to three things . Number one : Thursby ' as killed by the gamblers Monahan had welshed on in . hicago . Not knowing Thursby had sloughed Monaau  --  ornot believing it  --  they killed him because he ad been Monahan 's associate , or to get him out of theay so they could get to Monahan , or because he had'fused to lead them to Monahan . Number two : he was filled by friends of Monahan . Or number three : he sold Monahan out to his enemies and then fell out with them alid they killed him . " " Or number four , " Spade suggested with a cheerful smile : " he died of old age . You folks are n't serious , areyou ? " The two men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Spade turned his smile from one to the other of them and shook his head in mock pity . " You 've got Arnold Rothstein on the brain , " he said . Bryan smacked the back of his left hand down into the palm of his right . " In one of those three categories lies the solution . " The power in his voice was no longer atent . His right hand , a fist except for protruding fore nger , went up and then down to stop with a jerk when he finger was leveled at Spade 's chest . " And you can give us the information that will enable us to determine the category . " Spade said , " Yes ? " very lazily . His face was somber . lie touched his lower lip with a finger , looked at the finger , and then scratched the back of his neck with it.  |p180Little  irritable lines had appeared in his forehead . He blew his breath out heavily through his nose and his voice was an ill-humored growl . " You would n't want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You I could n't use it . It 'd poop this **28;176;TOOLONG you . " Bryan sat up straight and squared his shoulders . His voice was stern without blustering . " You are not the judge of that . Right or wrong , I am nonetheless the District Attorney . " Spade 's lifted lip showed his eyetooth . " I thought this was an informal talk . " " I am a sworn officer of the law twenty-four hours a day , " Bryan said , " and neither formality nor informalityjustifies your withholding from me evidence of crime , except of course "  --  he nodded meaningly  --  " on certain constitutional grounds . " " You mean if it might incriminate me ? " Spade asked . His voice was placid , almost amused , but his face was not . " Well , I 've got better grounds than that , or grounds that suit me better . My clients are entitled to a decent amount of secrecy . Maybe I can be made to talk to a Grand Jury or even a Coroner 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet , and it 's a cinch I'mnot going to advertise my clients ' business until I have to . Then again , you and the police have both accused me ) f being mixed up in the other night 's murders . I 've had trouble with both of you before . As far as I can see , my best chance of clearing myself of the trouble you 're trying to make for me is by bringing in the murderers  --  all tied up . And my only chance of ever catching them and tying them up and bringing them in is by keeping awayp181from you and the police , because neither of you show any signs of knowing what in hell it 's all about . " He rose and turned his head over his shoulder to address the stenographer : " Getting this all right , son ? Or am I going too fast for you ? " The stenographer looked at him with startled eyes and replied : " No , sir , I 'm getting it all right . " " Good work , " Spade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you want to go to the Board and tell them I 'm obstructing justice and ask them to revoke my license , hop to it . You 've tried it before and it did n't get you anything but a good laugh all around . " He picked up his hat . Bryan began : " But look here  --  " Spade said : " And I do n't want any more of these informaltalks . I 've got nothing to tell you or the police and I 'm God-damned tired of being called things by every crackpot on the city payroll . If you want to e Inc pinch me or subpoena me or something and I 'll come down with my lawyer . " He put his hat on his head , said , " See you at the inquest , maybe , " and stalked out.  | SPADE went into the Hotel Sutter and telephoned the Alexandria . Gutman was not in . No member o Gut van 's party was in . Spade telephoned the Belvedere . Cairo was not in , had not been in that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ greasy man in notable clothes was waiting in the outer room . Effie Perine , indicating the swart man , said : " This gentleman wishes to see you , Mr. Spade . " Spade smiled and bowed and opened the inner door " Come in .

He suspected one o his cashiers and a doorman of colluding to defraud him Spade hurried him through the story , promised to " tak care of it , " asked for and received fifty dollars , and go rid of him in less than half an hour .

She said : " If you do n't go down there this very minute , Sam , I will and I 'll take the police down there . " Her voice trem-P185pled , broke , and was thin and wailing . " Oh , Sam , go !
