When the British wanted to honor the seventh Earl of Shaftesbury , famed Victorian philanthropist , they did it with a pun . His memorial fountain in London 's bustling Piccadilly Circus is topped by an aluminum winged archer shooting an arrow downward ( " burying a shaft " ) . Popularly , the statue is known as the god of love , Eros . Tradition has it that , while Eros stands in Piccadilly , no Londoner can be arrested for kissing a girl . Last week , if any Londoner felt like kissing in public , he had to watch his step ; for Eros was removed-for the duration of World War II . <P> The removal was properly signalized by that proper British institution , the fourth editorial ( known as the Light Leader ) of the London Times . In its characteristic tone , half-bulldog , half-maiden aunt , the Light Leader thus saluted Eros ' departure : " From this moment onwards nobody can doubt that there is a war on , for London is the hub of the universe , and Piccadilly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hub of Piccadilly Circus . How then can the universe revolve , when its hub 's hub 's hub is missing ? . . . Until Eros returns to his perch . . . all of us . . . will be wearing an invisible lozenge of black crepe on our sleeves , just in the place where we so steadfastly refuse to wear our hearts . . . " <P> Underground but far from dormant is art in wartime London . Fortnight ago the Stafford Gallery , in a basement hardly a bomb 's throw from St. James 's Palace , opened the first important art show seen in London since the war began . Head of the Stafford Gallery is high-strung , capable Mrs. Ala Story . Keystone of her plan , a British Art Centre . <P> Organizer Story has formed a committee of Big Names , from Hugh Walpole to A. P. Herbert , has turned her basement into a rallying place for artists , patrons , critics , buyers , the art public . Air raids need not overly annoy visitors , for the British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and easy chairs .
