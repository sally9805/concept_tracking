THE HOME PLACE : CHRISTMAS MORNING BY DOROTHY THOMAS TIOR once Ralph woke before Phyllis , Li so that when she opened her eyes the room was already warmed and there was a yellow pattern of light on the rafters from the little oil heater they dressed by . Ralph was standing by the heater , dressed , rubbing his hands slowly up and down his legs to get the warmth through his cold clothes and into him , His lean face , with only the upward light on it , was older and sad and kind , like his father 's . Phyllis stirred , moved a little toward the bed edge , and he heard her at once and came to her . He bent over her and said , " Hello , Baby , how are you ? " " Fine , " Phyllis said . " Merry Christmas , Love . " Ralph pressed his lips against the back of her limp hand . " You did too much last night , Baby . You should have let the other girls trim the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to let the other girls do things like that . " Phyllis slid a little closer to him . " You spoil me , " she said . " Anyway , Edna had enough to do . She was working on the dinner , doing all that could be done the night before , and Willa would n't have a notion of how to trim a tree . I 'm not sure Edna would either . And I liked it . " " Well , how are you ? " Ralph asked again . " You know how I am . " " How ? " " Happy , " Phyllis whispered . They had learned in the month they had been sleeping in the attic room to speak their waking thoughts in whispers , so as not to waken their little daughter . Betty would be sleeping very lightly on Christmas morning . " And how 's the boy ? " Ralph asked . " All right . Only . . . I wish he was coming to-day . I wish he could be born on Christmas day . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . " We have our babies in the spring , along with the rest of the farm . That 's better . " " What kind of a day is it ? " " Pretty sharp , " Ralph said ; " pretty cold . I been up a good half hour , and this place is barely getting warmed up now . Did you know I 'd been up that long , Baby ? " " I did n't know , " Phyllis said . " I was dreaming . I dreamed . . . why , it 's gone ! I 've lost all but the very edge of my dream and it was such a clear one too . " " What 's the edge ? " " Oh , I was home , I was little , about Betty 's age , and at home . And Father was coming home from the bank and I ran to meet him . There was something especially happy about it . I 've forgotten just what it was , though I 'm sure it was n't Christmas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ralph laid his head against her and THE HOME PLACE : CHRISTMAS MORNING 211 she knew , without his saying anything , that she had hurt him a little , that to himself he was remembering that she had had an adoring father who had brought her up in a handsome house and given her everything a little girl could wish . He was remembering that he , her husband , had failed on his farm , and brought her , broke , to his people , to a farmhouse much too small for the four families it housed . " Poor Father , " Phyllis said . " They 're good to him , but hem be lonely . I wrote him a long letter . I thought I 'd not tell him until later  --  until nearly time for the baby to come . But I did . I wanted to give him something , if only a secret . Besides I 'm happy and he 'll see that in my letter . " She wanted to remind Ralph that her father had failed too , along with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing to do but stand at his window and fiddle with his watch chain or walk down Main Street past an empty bank building . " Betty 's waking , " Ralph said , and went to the child where she lay in her box-on-two-chairs bed . " Hi , Pet , " he said . The child put up wavering , sleepy arms . " Hi , Daddy , " she said . " Is it Christmas ? " " You 're darn tooting it 's Christmas ! " His arms went tight about the tiny body . " Mother , " she cried , " it 's Christmas ! " She struggled to get free from her father 's arms . " Let me down . Let me go , Daddy ! It 's Christmas . " " Here , " Ralph said , and gave her a gentle spank to quiet her . " You want to wake up those three hyenas ? You want to wake Edna 's boys up ? Come on ; Daddy 'll go down with you . Be a good joke on ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Are you sure the fire 's going good ? " Phyllis asked . " Are you sure it 's warm down there , Ralph ? " " Sure , Dad 's been up an hour . Edna and Mama are up too . I bet Old Granma 's up . She wakes before anybody . She do n't want to miss anything . " He chuckled , thinking of his old grandmother and her ways , and Phyllis felt that vexation she always felt at his fondness for the old woman . Little Betty was dancing about . Suddenly she streaked past her father , her nightgown fluttering , and Ralph was after her , crying , " Hey , Pet , where are you going ? " Phyllis heard squeals of laughter and fatherly kisses and knew that he had caught her at the top of the stairs and that their wish to see the tree before Edna 's boys woke was defeated by their own foolishness . She nestled deeper into the warmth of the feather-bed . Ralph and his mother and father would see to things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew she ought to get up , ought to go down and help , but she had tired herself the night before trimming the tree . She had worked all day making candy too . And it had been hard working in the kitchen with Edna . All her efforts  --  and she was a good enough cook  --  a better cook than Edna , actually , were made to look childish and foolish . Edna was getting ready for the Christmas dinner , and she made Phyllis feel in the way . Mama Young could work with Edna without friction . In the work of the house there was a kind of understanding between Edna and Mania Young , an agreeable , sensible understanding . Phyllis , thinking of Edna and her life of hard work and no thanks , wondered how she would live her life at all if Ralph felt toward her as Tom felt toward Edna . And how would she endure it if Ralph treated her as Harvey treated Villa ? She remembered a night in their own home , on their own farm , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were at the table , she and Ralph and the hired girl and the two hired men , and she had said something that evidently , to the men , had a quite different meaning from her intention . One of the men had snorted his laughter , then choked . She had looked to Ralph and found him shaking with laughter too , silent laughter . She jumped up from the table and ran into her room . Ralph followed her and said , his arms about her , " But what you said was so funny , Baby . See ? It was nothing , nothing at all . It just struck us funny the way you said it . Just dumb men , that 's all . You forget it . " " But Olga , " ( Phyllis wept ) " she laughed too . " " Well , she understood . You 're different , Phyllis . You 've been raised in a glass house . I used to think before I married you I 'd lam you something , but I gave it up . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little spoiled little princess , and no help for it . " " I 'm no such thing . That 's simply nonsense . " Phyllis had wept , already wrapped round again in the love that made it possible for her to breathe . " I 'm your wife ! " " Right you are , and a darn good one , " Ralph had said . " And now you wo n't cry any more , will you , Baby ? I 've got to get out to my chores . " She had cried more , a little , when he had gone . But she had stopped to wonder about the thing that had happened to her . She had not been able to tell him , she would have been ashamed had she had the words , that her world had slid quite out from under her because her husband had seemed to let go of his love for her for just an instant , for just long enough to laugh at her with Olga and the two hired men . She was a spoiled girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good wife too . What would she do if Ralph treated her as Tom treated Edna , as Harvey treated Willa ? " I 'd die , " she saidaloud , and stretched a little , nestled deeper into the bed , and fell asleep . When she woke someone was rapping sharply at her door . She was astonished to see her young , new sister-in-law , Willa , standing there with her brocaded pajama jacket wrapped tightly round her shivering self . " Phyllis , " Willa said in her high plaintive voice , " can I come in ? Can 1 get in with you ? " Phyllis lifted the covers for Willa to get in beside her . She hugged the cold , shivering girl close to her . " How 'd you happen to get up so early ? " Phyllis asked . " Is Harvey up ? Are they all up now ? " " Ralph got us up , " Willa said . " We were asleep , we were trying to sleep , and those brats of Edna 's were howling round out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carrying Old Grandma Young . " " Into yours and Harvey 's room ? " " Yes ! He said , ' Here , you , Granma wants to get in her own bed on Christmas morning . You kids get up now and let Granma have her hed . ' Then you know , you know what she 'd say . She said , she said to Harvey  --  Ralph holding her there , like a baby ; she looked down at us and said to Harvey , ' George , who 's that ? Who is that woman ? ' About me , see ? " Though her back was to Phyllis and her yellow hair all that Phyllis could see of her head , she knew how Willa had tightened her lips like an old woman 's in saying Grandma 's speech . " Gosh , this sure is a Christmas ! " she finished . Both girls laughed a little , Willa very bitterly . With her arm about Willa 's slender shoulders , Phyllis lay thinking of her husband 's people . . For the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to talk a little about the Young family 's babying of Old Grandma , Phyllis felt some love for Willa . That Willa was hard and THE HOME PLACE : CHRISTMAS MORNING 213 ugly-natured and would not help at all with the work , she forgot for a little . She felt sympathy for her . The Youngs did seem so all-to-themselves in their humoring of Old Grandma , in their delight at her everlasting insistence that her youngest grandson Harvey was her own son George , who had been dead many years . Ralph never failed to " get a kick " out of her notion that Willa was a heathen woman George had picked from a mission in the Klondike . " Did you stop by the tree ? " Phyllis asked . " Did you open your pres-ents ? " " No , " Willa said . " I know what mine is already . Socks ! Bed socks . Mama Young knitted them , out of yarn from an old shawl , or something . " " They 'll be nice , " Phyllis said and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure , " Willa agreed . " I did n't mean that . I meant  --  I think Harvey did n't get me anything . " Her voice rose , pained , angry . " How could he ? " Phyllis defended her youngest brother-in-law . " There 's no money . The cream money was just for the stamps to send letters and for the stuff for the candy . Did you get him something ? " " Yes . " " What ? " " You wait ; you wait and see ! " Willa was always telling people to wait and see , as though she felt sure of reckonings when Willa would come out on top . " Where 's Edna ? " Phyllis asked . " Kitchen , I guess , getting break-fast . " " And Tom ? " " Outside , I guess . " Willa half turned toward Phyllis and brushed the hair back from her forehead with her thin fingers . " Oh , " she said , her voice suddenly gentle , " you know what Tom did ? He got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Skates ! Why , how ? " " I do n't know . They were trying them on when I went through to the kitchen . They 're going down to the river to skate . " " But how ? " Phyllis asked . " There was n't any money left . " " I do n't know , " Willa said , almost whining . " You wait . You 'll see . . . " her voice trailed off . She was almost asleep . Phyllis did not like the morning smell of face powder and tobacco about Willa 's neck and hair . She got up , sliding carefully round Willa , and went to stand by the stove while she dressed . She put on her red wool dress that little Betty liked so much . In the mirror over the dresser she saw that she looked rested and pretty enough . Her dark hair curled softly round her ears and her eyes were bright . She quietly made up Betty 's little bed , turned the oil stove out , opened the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , slid from her place on her grandfather 's knee by the kitchen stove and ran to her , her arms full of gifts . " Look I " she screamed . " Look at my Christmas . And come look here ! " Her arms were too full for her to take her mother 's hand , but she danced ahead into the dining room . " Look at my table and chairs , " she cried , almost beside herself with joy . " Grandpa made them ! He sawed them and hammered them and put them together and painted them and everything . " Grandpa Young followed , sheepishly , to see Phyllis 's pleasure in his little granddaughter 's gift . " Yes sir , " he said , after whistling a little through his teeth . " Yes sir , I always thought a little girl should have a red table and chairs . My sister , my sister Dora , she had a little red table and two chairs Pa made for her . Good work too , fancier than these here . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to use what I had on hand . I like a brighter red for a little girl 's table and chairs . This was just some on the place . " Betty dropped everything and ran to climb up on her grandfather and kiss his face and neck . While he held her tightly she threw her head back so that her hair fell like falls , and her throat was an arch , and she cried , " Granpa , I love you more than all the trees and all the houses in all the world . " Phyllis slid her fingertips over the shining table-top . She saw as in two mirrors a recession of little Young girls , for generations and generations , standing by little red tables their grandfathers had made for them . She saw her daughter 's daughter too standing by her little red table . Her mother-in-law had come into the room , still breathing hard from making up her feather-bed . " What is it , Phyllis ? " she asked . " Do n't you feel good ? " " I feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little lightheaded but I feel fine . I feel I Caine into the kingdom to have little Young girls standing by little red tables , world without end amen ! " Her mother-in-law put a warm , strong-under-soft arm about her and said , " I know how you feel . You need your coffee . You overdid yesterday . Have you looked at your presents ? Well , come have your breakfast first . You look kind of wobbly to me . " " I feel fine , " Phyllis said again and allowed herself to be led into the kitchen . The menfolk had come in from the stables and were just sitting down to breakfast . " Merry Christmas , " her brothers-in-law greeted her , and Harvey , who was less shy than Tom , got up from his place and came round to her and kissed her soundly on the mouth . She put up her hand andpatted his firm lean cheek . The Young men looked on approvingly , wishing in their hearts , Phyllis knew , that Harvey , the youngest and tallest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you want your egg ? " Edna spoke from over by the stove . Phyllis , in the warmth of greetings from the menfolk , had forgotten Tom 's wife . " It 's Christmas . We get our eggs to order this morning , " Ralph explained . " That 's nice , " Phyllis said . " But I 'm late , Edna . Let me fix my own breakfast . " " Just as you like , " Edna said tiredly and brought her own well-loaded plate and sat down by her husband . Tom frowned . Phyllis could see he was vexed and ashamed that Edna had not gone ahead and fixed Phyllis 's eggs after she 'd said she would . Edna ate and did not lift her eyes . " I 'll fix your eggs , Baby , " Ralph said , " and I know how you want them . " He reached for his sister-in-law 's apron string , gave it a yank , and pulled the apron from Edna 's heavy hips . " Merry Christmas , Ednal " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! " Edna gave her snorting laugh , and her mouth quivered at the corners a little when the laugh was done . She suffered at the unfamiliar red that came to her face . " Oh , why does n't he love her ? " Phyllis thought in anger . " Why does n't Tom love Edna ? How can she bear it , how can she stand Christmas or any other day , without him loving her ? How can he half love Willa instead  --  little , skinny and mean as she is  --  when Edna is here , strong and kind and willing under her harshness . Why does n't he go to her and be sweet to her and see what happens ? Maybe she 'd bloom , like a  --  like a cabbage ! " She began to laugh to herself . " What 's the joke , Baby ? " Ralph asked . " Here 's your coffee and your THE HOME PLACE : poached eggs 'll be along in a minute . " " We 're going skating , " Tom said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Hope they do n't break their necks . " " Yeh , " IIarvey said . " Where do you suppose Dad found those old skates ? ' Member the Christmas we got them , Torn ? You and Ralph taught me between you  --  and let me drop now and then , doggone you , for the fun of it . It was a morning like this , was n't it ? Cold , snow under foot , a little , but the ice was clean . " Tom smiled . " A-uh , " he said . " We sure made Mama mad . We took Harve  --  he could n't ' a been but around six  --  down to the river and we skated him up and down all day , about . Brought him home with such a leg ache he bawled all night . Had croup too , did n't you , Harve ? " " Do n't remember a thing about it but the skating , " Harvey said . " And here 's your eggs , Duchess ! " Ralph said , carrying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in the cellar or in the old tool chest , or somewhere , " Tom went on ; " sharpened ' em up and fitted ' em to the kids ' shoes last night . When they got up there was the skates on their shoes . " Edna smiled a little . Grandpa had done something for her boys , something that was almost as much work as making a little table and two chairs for Betty , his favorite . " How 'd you like to come down to the river with us , Baby ? " Ralph asked his wife . " We 'll build a good fire . I 'd take along a blanket for you to wrap round you . You 'd not get cold . You could sit and watch . " " Why , I can skate , " Phyllis said . " I 'm a good skater . And my skates are in my trunk . I brought them along . " " Swell ! " Harvey said . " We 'll all skate . " CHRISTMAS MORNING 215 " I can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard her in the general pleasure over Phyllis 's being able to skate , over her having thought to bring her skates along . Old Grandma Young had come into the kitchen and was making her trembling way toward the breakfast table . " Hello , Granmal " Ralph yelled at her deafness . " Merry Christmas ! Want another breakfast ? " The old woman put out her hands to him , to be led . " Another ? " she said and drew a long face . " Why , you smartie , I 've not had my first yet . Is it Christmas Day ? I guess it is . It must be something like that . I woke up in my own bed . Yes , I did . I been shoved around from pillar to post in this house . Pa left me to my boy Arch . He said , his last words : ' Arch , you look after your mother , ' and I thought he would . He has , I guess , best he can . But here in my old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bed of my own , but can I sleep in it ? No . No , I might be an old shoe . I can sleep in the kitchen corner , me and the cat . Some woman sleeps in my bed , some young woman . She sleeps in there with one of you boys , and I 'm going to speak to your father about it . " Ralph laughed and patted his old grandmother 's knee . " Aw , Granma , " he yelled , " you 're foxy but you ca n't fool me . You 'd like us to think you 're fuddled , but you 're not . You 're clear as a bell . You know just what you 're saying . You 're all right . " " Why , I am not , " the old woman said , laughed a little , and looked round on them all . " A course I 'm all right , though it 's enough to mix up anybody to get moved from their own bed , like I been . But I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tip in it . I was dreaming . I was dreaming about my boy George . " She turned to Phyllis and touched her wrist with the handle of her spoon . " You know , I lost my boy , " she confided , " my youngest son . I had a fine boy , grown up , just grown to manhood , twenty-two he was , and he said , ' Ma , I 'm going to Alaska , where the gold is ' ; and you know , nothing could hold him , not his Pa , or not me . He was set on going . I said to his Pa , ' Talk to him , Pa ; see if you ca n't swing him to stay home . ' But no , nothing could swing him to stay . He said , when I would n't let up beggin ' him to stay , ' We 'll say no more about it , Ma , ' and then  --  he went . If his father said , ' We 'll say no more about it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but not with my boys . He went away up there and . . . say , where 's that woman ? Did he send her back ? " " What woman , Granma ? " Ralph asked . The old woman creased the edges of the oilcloth table cover . " I ca n't say , " she said , deeply confused . " There was a woman George brought home here . It was a mistake , I guess . " Harvey sighed deeply . " Where is Willa ? " he asked . " Oh , she 's up in my room , sleeping , " Phyllis said . " Do you think she 'd like to go skating with us ? " " No , let her sleep , " Harvey said . Mama Young came into the kitchen with her hand on little Betty 's shoulder . " Well , I hope I 've got this girl away from that tree long enough to eat her breakfast , " she said . " 1 got her dressed and dished up breakfast for her when Edna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think she hardly ate a hi to ... why , Granma Young , what 're you doing , eating another breakfast ? " " Why , Mamie , what 's wrong with you ? This is my first breakfast . I woke in my bed , my own bed and ? " " No , you did n't , Grandma , " Mama Young said kindly enough ; " you woke in the kitchen , and i washed you and got you dressed and gave you your breakfast and then Ralph came down and carried you in and put you into your own bed in your room . " " Well , it 's time ! " Old Grandma said and began to cry a little . " I should n't ever ' a been yanked outa it . " " Now , Ma , " Grandpa Young said , " you do n't need to talk that way . You try and think back , and you 'll remember it was your idea . When things went bad and the young folks came home , they had to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can have mine . I 'd just as soon sleep in the kitchen . ' " " Well , what if I did ! " Old Grandma wept . " What of id You 've no business to hold me to it just because I made that offer . I 'm an old woman . I 've lived a hard life and I 've never held back or shirked . Last words your Pa said was , ' Arch , you look after your mother , ' and now , here I have to sleep in the kitchen . I may go any day , any night , likely , and am I to be taken sleepin ' in the kitchen ! " Mama Young patted Old Grandma on the shoulder . " You come in and see the tree , Granma , " she said , " and you tell little Betty here about Christmas when you were a girl in Indiana . " The old lady brought her hands down on the table . " We made Christmas , " she cried , " and you do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . We begun around Thanksgiving , for I had a German grandmother , as well as my Irish one , and not a cookie would we children get to see . Everything was hid away . You 'd look at a door , a closet door , and you 'd no more ' a opened it than anything . Everything was secret . You 'd think you 'd be struck dead if you put your hand on the knob . " " And did n't you ever peek , Granma , not once ? " Ralph asked . The old woman nodded . " Acourse I did , " she said . " Silas and I peeked . He was my cousin , and he wore his hair still in long curls . We peeked into the kitchen and saw the cookies THE HOME PLACE : CHRISTMAS MORNING 217 spread all over the table , stars and pipes , and flowers and birds , with seed and red sugar on them . The cookie cutters were there too , the old German ones . " " And did you get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was winter , and if you do n't think they have winter in Indiana you 're wrong . They do . It can get bitter cold . And the Christmas treel We had all those trimmings from Germany that were my grandma 's , my Ma 's ma . Silver angels at the top , over candlesticks , and when the candles were lighted , the angels begun to move round and round , from the heat of the candle flames , and going round , they touched three little bells and made chime-music , sweet as anything . " Betty slid from her chair and came to her great-grandmother 's side . " And did they sing ? " she breathed . " Did they sing Glory to God in the Highest ? " " Where are those things  --  the cookie cutters and the tree trimmings ? " Grandpa Young asked . " Who 'd they go to , Ma ? " " Why , I do n't know , Son . But they did n't come to me and your Pa . I guess they went to some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I guess , of souls living , I 'm the only one to recall and tell of it . A boy like Silas , with such curls , such a hardy boy . They killed him in the War , I guess . Yes , that 's what happened to him . In Sixty-three , that was . But we stood there in the kitchen door , so bold , and holding hands , the door wide open , and looked , but we neither of us touched a cookie . It did n't come into our minds . " " Well , if we 're going skating had n't we better get going ? " Tom asked . " Get your skates , Phyllis ; they 'll probably need a little honing . " " Why , what are you saying ! " Old Grandma cried . " Mamie , is n't this the girl who 's going to have a child ? Well , she 's not to go skating . ' T would be a piece of foolhardiness . You stay home , my dear . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the table ? " Edna asked loudly . " I got a big dinner to get , and I ca n't do a thing with you all in the kitchen . " " Yes , Edna 's right , " Mama Young said . " I do n't know when I 've known you to linger at the table so . I guess you 're having a good time . Arch , is n't it good to have them all here together ? And all so well and strong . We 've got that . There 's no sickness in the house this year . " " Yes , " Old Grandma said , " it 's cause we 've had such a good cold winter and the frost cleared the air of sickness . A good freeze , and that blizzard . Did n't we have a blizzard , Son ? " " Why , we had blizzard on blizzard , Granma , " Ralph said . " Shoo ! Get out , all of you , " Mama Young said , " and do n't come back till two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll stay here and help . Grandma 's right . She should n't be skating . Might be all right and it might not . " " Do you want to go along , Pet , or do you want to stay by the tree ? " Ralph asked Betty . His daughter stood twisting her clasped hands . The decision was hard for her . " The tree , " she cried at last . " I 'll stay by the tree . " When he had put on his sheepskin and cap Ralph kissed his child and wife and followed his brothers out into the cold of the morning . Phyllis stood by the window and watched them go , the three of them running , their skates over their shoulders . " Fine men , those Young boys ! " she said to her mother-in-law , and they laughed proudly together . " Come into the dining room before we start clearing up the dishes , " Mama Young said , " and you come too , Edna . Phyllis has n't seen her presents yet . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edna said . Little Betty skipped ahead to open the door and to dance around the tree and take down her mother 's presents for her . " Why , how 'd I get so many ? " Phyllis asked when they were piled in her lap . " Because you 're prettiest ! " Betty said , and was suddenly embarrassed and buried her face in her grandmother 's apron and twisted her little backside and giggled . " The bedsocks I made all the same stitch for each you girls , " Mama Young said . " I wanted so to get new yarn and have ' em each a different color , but that was out of the question , acourse , so I got out that old shawl that Jenny , my best friend when I was a young woman , Jenny , knit for me . The place the moths had been in it was just in the one corner , and the rest was still perfectly good . I 'd have picked red for you if I could have picked . It 's a warmer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phyllis said , and leaned to kiss the older woman . Mama Young was a little embarrassed when Phyllis unwrapped Harvey 's present to her . " That ragged old book ! " she said . " I do n't know what possessed him to think it was fit for a present . It 's just a reader , is n't it , a first or second reader ? And you know , it really belongs to the schools ! See , it has it in here : School District Number 7 . I suppose there 's some little story or verse-poem in it or something he remembers and thought you 'd like . I do regret I 've had so little time for reading , Phyllis . If there 's another life that 's anything like this one , I hope I get a chance to read in it . You know , sometimes I get kinda panicky when I think how near run my life is , likely , and all I 've left undone . I always meant to read a lot of books . I had a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was frowned on in our house for girls . It was really a shameful thing to sit down and read a book so long as there was a thing you could lift your hand to . I thought when I had my own house  --  but no  --  Granma Young was with us and she 'd not have liked it a bit , and there was always mending or sewing or something when I 'd get a chance to sit down . Oh dear ! Open Ralph 's present , why do n't you ? " " Why , a mirror ! " Phyllis cried . " Yes , a hand mirror . Ralph was going to make it himself when he found that nice hardwood board from an old bedstead that was mine when I was first married and that square of looking-glass ; but Arch thought he 'd like to do it , and Ralph knows his father is far and away a better hand with tools than he is . Is n't the carving nice ? Ralph found a picture of the way he 'd like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Is n't that as natural a rose as you ever saw ? " " It 's lovely , " Phyllis said , and threw back her head , looking in the mirror and smoothing her hair with her palm . Her cheeks were redder than usual and her eyes bright . " Now mine , mine , mine ! " Betty demanded . The paper on Betty 's present to her mother was badly wrinkled and the ribbon twisted . It was plain the package had been tied and untied many times . " A trayl " Phyllis said . She had seen the tray many times and had promised over and over to forget it absolutely and be surprised on Christmas morning . " Why , it 's the prettiest tray I 've ever seen . " " For pins , " Betty cried and reached up and took a pin from her grandmother 's bosom and dropped it into the tray with a flourish . " We made them in school . " " Thank you , darling , " Phyllis said ; " it 's lovely . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lovely , lovely , " Betty sang and began to hop around the tree on one foot . " We 'd better get out to the kitchen , " Mama Young said ; " we must n't let Edna do it all alone . " " Oh , the dinner , the dinner ! " Betty sang . " We still have the dinner ! " " And in the evening the apples and nuts and candy , " Mama Young said , " do n't forget that . Your mother made the candy . You must write all the receipts out for me , Phyllis . That 's something I never learned , to make candy . Plain taffy 's all my boys ever got but they used to like that . You must write them all out . " " Yes , " Phyllis said , " before I go away . Do you suppose we 'll ever go away ? Think you 'll have your house cluttered with us forever , Mama Young ? You 've made us such a welcome . We forget , really , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for us . " The red washed over Mama Young 's face and her eyes brimmed . " Why , Phyllis , you fuss me so , " she said . " Do n't talk that way . I do n't put myself out . They 're my boys and you girls are their wives . And I 'm mighty thankful I 've been spared till now . Last winter , you know , I had the quinsy , and I did think , myself , I was going , and I hung on so . I could n't help but feel I 'd be needed yet by more than Arch and Old Granma . And if things stay bad like they are I may be needed even worse . I want to be here when your baby comes . And  --  you 're a daughter to me , Phyllis . " They looked into each other 's eyes , and Phyllis saw all the hurt Mama Young had known and would never know less because two of her sons had married badly . " You 're right for Ralph , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That 's something to stay us , Arch and me , that you and Ralph are together and have Betty and this one that 's coming . " Betty had been playing the other side the tree . Now she came to her mother and asked , " Who 's coming ? Is somebody coming for Christmas ? " " I 'll go out and help Edna , " Mama Young said ; " there 's a lot to do . " " I 'll come in a minute , " Phyllis said , and sat down on one of the little red chairs at Betty 's Christmas table . " Ah , I 'll pour you some tea , Mrs. Lady , " Betty said stylishly , and spread her skirts round her , lifted her shoulders and pursed her mouth . " It 's a lovely day , is n't it ? " " Indeed it is , Mrs. M'IIoney , " Phyllis said in a lady voice , " but I think it 's going to snow , do n't you ? " " I declare , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it 's as fine as sugar . " " Snowflakes may be like sugar Or like sand , Snowflakes may be like pieces of wool , Like feathers , Like breath , Or like stars in the hand , " Phyllis quoted . Betty looked at her mother over the edge of her little cup and said in her everyday voice , " Mother , do you suppose Mama Young would mind if I named my doll Jesus ? " " I do n't know , dear , " Phyllis said . " She made the doll for you , so perhaps you 'd better ask her . I think she would n't care . In Mexico they name their real babies Jesus . " " Do they Just their Christmas babies or babies any time ? " " Their anytime babies . " " And are they good people ? " " Yes , of course . " " I thought Mexicans were some of the bad people . " " Oh , no , they 're good . All people are good . " " Why , Mama ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , of course , but they are n't any special kind . " " They 're all mixed up , are n't they ? " " Yes . " " Willa gave me the dishes , Mother . She gave me this whole tea-set . " " She did ? That 's nice . " " But Mother ? " Betty leaned across the table , narrowed her eyes , put her hand on her mother 's wrist , and said , " where did she get the money ? " " Oh , darling , do n't say that , do n't talk like that . It 's Christmas , and everyone 's been grand to you . Grandpa made you the table and chairs , and Mama Young made you a doll , and made you your new dress . You must just be happy on Christmas and not think about money . " " I know , " Betty said , " but where did she get it , Mama ? Do you think they cost a dollar ? " " I do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ someone sent it to her in a letter . You must thank her , first thing , when she gets up . " " Let 's go out and help with the dinner , " Betty said like a grown person . She got up and stretched herself and smoothed the hair back from her face in a gesture like her mother 's . The kitchen was full of good smells . There was a mingling of mince and sage , of burning cobs , of new bread . " Now come look , Betty , " Mama Young said ; " come look at the goose all stuffed and ready . See , she 's all sewed upI Open the oven door for Grandma . Careful , careful , Sweet . Do n't burn yourself . " " You can go down and fetch up the jelly and jam and pickles , if you want , " Edna said to Phyllis . " I 'll go too and help fetch , " Betty said , and ran to the cellar door . " Take a pan , take a bake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Young said . On the dark stairs , her hand in her mother 's , Betty whispered over and over , " Fetch , fetch , fetch . " " What arc you saying , dear ? " Phyllis asked . " I think I 'm saying ' fetch , ' " Betty said , " but I 'm not sure . If you say a word a lot of times it gets bigger and bigger or it gets littler and littler and then it goes out . Does n't it for you , Mother ? You do n't know if it 's the word you started with , pretty soon . It sounds awful funny . Is ' fetch ' really fetch , Mother ? " " Yes , " Phyllis said ; " we 're going to fetch the jams and pickles and jelly . And let 's find some piccalilli . There 's a word for you . " Betty , at the foot of the cellar stairs , threw herself backward onto some sacks of potatoes and lay there , her arms spread wide , her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Get up , " Phyllis said . " It 's cold down here . Let 's get the stuff , Betty . " Betty got up , and stretched to see the Labels on the jam jars . " Well , it 's a kind of warm cold , do n't you think , Mother ? It smells warm down here , do n't you think ? " " I think you 're going to take a nap after dinner , " Phyllis said . Betty turned and looked up at her mother with the quickly adjusted hurt look little girls give grown-ups when they find themselves alone in their childhood again after , for a moment , having shared it . " Yes , let 's fetch the jams and stuff , " she said brightly . When they had filled the pan they went upstairs . Mama Young opened the door for them . " Well , would you look at that ! " she said , raising her hands high for Betty 's pleasure . " Did you pick and choose all those , Sweet ? " Betty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nodded gravely and went into the dining room , to her table and dishes , and her doll . " My , girls , we ought n't to complain of anything , " Mama Young said , " with a cellar full like this . It makes me a little ashamed , yes , it really does , THE HOME PLACE : CHRISTMAS MORNING 221 though goodness knows Edna and I worked hard enough putting the stuff up . I wish we could share it . Last year and other years , I sent good big boxes of jam and fruit and stuff to all Arch 's nephews and to others ; but this year , we just had n't the mailing postage for it . They 'll understand . The boxes to the church was all we did this year . Would you like to peel the potatoes now , Phyllis ? " " I 'll peel them , " Edna said , " and Phyllis can go set the table . We 'll eat in the dining room to-day , wo n't we , and use the big cloth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mama Young said , " and you can fetch the tablecloth and napkins from the chest in my room , Phyllis . Edna did them up so nice . You 're a wonderful ironer , Edna . " Edna sniffed her pleasure in the praise . " My mother was a good ironer , " she said . Then , " We 're going over there for New Year 's day . We 're going over to my brothers ' . " " Your brothers ? " Phyllis said . " Why yes , I got folks , " Edna said shortly . " I got five brothers , three of them still to home , hatching . I want to go over and bake them up some stuff . All right if I take some can stuff ? " " Of course , of course , " Mama Young said , " and take some chickens too , Edna . Bake them up some chickens before you go , why do n't you ? You 'll take your boys along ? " " I guess so . My brothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with ' em and take ' em hunting . There 's no school till Monday after . They 'd as well go along . " Phyllis went into Mama Young 's room to get the big tablecloth and napkins . They were beautifully ironed and wrapped in blue tissue paper . How nice to think of Edna and her boys being away for even one day , for New Year 's day ! For a day or two she would not have to see Edna 's lumpy shoulders and hear her voice  --  and the boys would be away . Little Betty would be free from their rough teasing . Maybe she would stay several days if she meant to do a lot of baking for her bachelor brothers . Maybe there , among her own people , was the place Edna bloomed . Maybe there she was really at home . Maybe it was terribly hard for Edna to live in the Young house and be the least loved of all . Mama and Grandpa Young 's room was a little like Phyllis 's own with its bright quilts and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to get into it and go to sleep . She was tired , and the day barely under way . When she came out to the dining room with the tablecloth she found that Mama and Grandpa Young had already widened the table , had put in the leaves . Old Grandma was excited by having her say about the day and about the meal . The cloth , careful as they were in laying it , was not quite " right with the world " and had to be lifted and laid again . Betty squealed with delight to see it billow when it was lifted . " I 'll bring holly from my trunk , " Phyllis said and went into Old Grandma 's room that had been hers and Ralph 's and little Betty 's room when they first came to the Young home-place , to get the paper holly from a box in the trunk till . Mama Young came in while she was still hunting for it . " Well , never mind it , Phyllis , " she said . " Never mind if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , alone , and the goose and cranberries and pickles and all make it kind of decorated . Anyway , the men and boys will be so hungry with all this skating they 'll not notice much . They 'll just want to eat . " Mama Young laughed and looked away to the snowy windows . " Why are you laughing ? " Phyllis asked . " Oh , I guess I 'd be ashamed to say . Your looking for the holly for the table and me telling you not to mind brought something to my mind , that 's all . It made me think of when I was first married . " What ? " " Oh , just that . The hours and hours and yards of work I did to have my clothes pretty . " " And was n't Grandpa pleased with them ? " Mama Young creased her apron in neat tucks . " Oh , I guess so , " she said , " when he got around to it . Come on . I ought to be in the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hungry , " Phyllis said , " here 's the holly , and they 'll get that too , along with their meal , and they 'd better like it . " " My , it sure looks nice , " Grandpa Young said to his wife . " You set an awful good table , Mamie , you always have , in lean times and plenty . I do n't know how you 've managed , but you have . " " Well , I guess you were n't starved when you were a boy ! " Old Granma Young bristled . " I went down toward the river , walked part way down , this morning , " Grandpa said , " and you know , Mamie , it was a funny thing . Those three boys of Tom 's put me in mind of our three the Christmas I got their skates for ' em . And yet , there 's our three too , grown and all well and hearty , skatin ' along with ' em . Though , acourse , Tom 's boys are closer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did you know , Phyllis , " Mama Young said , " I guess I never told you , but we lost two little boys , between Tom and Ralph . I 'll show you baby Archie 's picture sometime . The other we did n't have taken , and how I wish we had ! Oh dear . " " Well , that 's the way it is , " Old Grandma said . " I remember the boys you lost , Mamie . Just this last instant I recall one of them clear . Little fellow lyin ' on my lap . I remember holding him just after you 'd bathed him and you 'd gone to fetch his gown , and so slippery on my knee . I could hardly hold him . I remember I said to you , ' Mamie , you 'll never raise this child . He 's too fair . ' Well , that 's the way it is . You lost two . I had nine , is n't that right , Son ? I had nine , and I 've lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One I did n't see laid away . My youngest , George . And I ca n't lay him away in my mind , either . The door opens and I catch my breath . I think I 'll look up and see him there . He went away to the Klondike . Are n't all my children gone but you , Arch ? You and Mamie . " " Yes , Ma , " Grandpa Young said . " Jim was the last , and Mamie here 's my wife . She 's not your child , Ma . " " Well , no matter . She 's been long in the house . She 's a good girl but a little contrary . " The old woman looked wonderingly at Phyllis , making in her throat those troubled sounds she always made when her mind clouded again after a clear moment . " And who are you , child ? " she asked . " I seem to remember you . Did you have a baby ? You look young to be a mother . Why , you look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Are n't you the one who has a little baby ? " " Not until spring , Grandma , " Phyllis said , and stroked with her free hand the old hands that held hers . " Well , then we 've no business to talk like we been . We 've no business to talk of death and hard times and trouble in front of you . This is one to be cherished , son . You tell whichever one of the boys ' she is , Arch . She 's not hardy . " Arch leaned toward his mother and put his hand on her shoulder . " It 's THE HOME PLACE : Christmas Day , Mal " he yelled . " Today is Christmas ! " " Oh , yes , so they said , " Old Grandma said . " I woke in my own bed . And are there bells ? In Indiana there were always bells . We 'd hear them of a morning . They had seven churches in that town and one would have served . Clear out in the country @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place , we could hear the bells , clear out to the mill . Open the windows , Archl Let 's hear them . Silas and I we 'd lean out the window . He was a fine boy . Cheeks like apples . Open the windows , Son . " " That 's a good idea . It 's warm in here , " Mama Young said . " Let 's open the window , Phyllis . You look sick , child . Are you all right ? " " How far along is she ? " Old Grandma asked . " Two and a half months , I always said , is the hard time to get by . If you 're going to miscarry you 're most like to miscarry at two and a half months . I carried every one of my nine full time , myself . But I remember my Aunt Kate used to say ? " " It 's stuck a little , with the frost , I guess , " Mama Young said , working with the window . Phyllis helped her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the stove breathed in as deeply as she could of the snowy air . " Good , good , " she said . Willa had come from upstairs and was standing , still in her pajama jacket , still with her hair uncombed , looking at the tree . " Did you get a good sleep ? " Phyllis asked . " Did you get your sleep out ? " " Yes , " Willa said . Her eyes were very wide , very disappointed . " I sent away , " she said in a high complaining voice , " I sent away and borrowed money and got Harvey a present , and he has n't opened it . It 's still here on the tree . I got him a present and Betty some dishes . " CHRISTMAS MORNING 223 " She loves the dishes , " Phyllis said . " She 's played with them a lot this morning . Harvey did n't see your present , I guess . He 'll find it when they come in . They 're down on the river skating . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said and went , sobbing , into her room . " Oh dear , " Mania Young said , " what 's to be done ? I try , but I do n't know what to do for the girl . Should I go to her ? " " Leave her be , " Old Grandma said . " You leave her be , Mamie . She 's a stranger . That 's all she is . George should have let the missionaries keep her . George meant well , I 'm sure , but it was a mistake . George had the kindest heart in the family , but he was so headstrong . Bullheaded really . " " Come to the window , " Phyllis said . " Come see them , Grandma Young . The men are coming . Come see , Betty . Daddy 's coming , and all of them . " Mama Young came and little Betty , but Old Grandma , if she heard , preferred to stay by the stove . " One , two , three , four , five , six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the snow ! " Phyllis said . It was snowing so hard they could not see the fences . The three tall figures and the three small ones stood out sharply in the moving whiteness . " You must n't catch cold , " Mama Young said to Phyllis . She drew her apron up round the girl 's shoulders . " I think you 've been a little feverish the whole morning . There 's fever in your face . And your hair 's full of snow . " " Well , are the bells ringing ? " Old Grandma croaked . " If they 're not , how 'd you like to put down that window ? You 're chilling me to the bone . You seem to forget , Mamie , I 'm an old woman . " Mama Young drew Phyllis away and put down the window . " Now what 'll we do with ' em , all over the hour until dinner 's on the table ? " she asked . " They 'll take the place . Edna 'll be so cross . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Old Grandma said . " That 's what my Pa used to say ; but there , acourse we had the wood , in Indiana , and here we have n't . I ca n't get used to burning these cobs , no , not all the time I 've lived in this country . A cob fire 's a puny thing . " Little Betty came and leaned against her great-grandmother 's side . She stood on tiptoe and put her mouth against the old woman 's ear . " Did they , Grandma Young ? " she whispered . " Did those angels sing Glory to God ? " " Why , acourse ! " Old Grandma said . " Do n't anybody read this child the Bible ? Why yes , of course ! The glory of the Lord shone round about them . That 's what they sang , and Peace on Earth . " " Shall we go help Edna ? " Phyllis asked Betty , and reached for her hand . Ralph met them in the doorway , caught up his girl and swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neck . " Well , Pet , " he said , " you having a good Christmas ? Holy mackerel ! All those presents yours ? What are you going to call your doll ? " " Marjorie , I guess , " Betty said . " And how are you , Baby ? Wish you 'd gone along . How are you ? " " I 'm fine , " Phyllis said . " Only I feel a little giddy . I 've felt a little giddy all morning . " " Well , you look all right . You look swell . Where 'd you get that dress ? I never saw this one before , did I ? " " Not very likely . I 've only had i since before we were married . " " You do n't say ! Well  --  I guess you never wore it then . " A whining cry came from the kitchen and Phyllis drew away from Ralph and ' looked at him searchingly , her lips tight-set . " Those boys are teasing Betty again , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Honey . Do n't get excited . They ? ey wo n't kill her . I 'll go out there and see to them . It 's Christmas , you know . " There was tenderness under his mocking tone . She leaned to him and he bent to kiss her mouth . " Merry Christmas , Baby , " he said . Beyond the safeness and strength of his touch Phyllis felt the whole house and the difference that was on it be . cause of the day . " Christmas is something , " she said , " And thank you for the mirror . It 's lovely . " Edna came by them with a heavy dish in her hand . She set the dish clown on the table and stepped over by the tree and for an instant leaned above Betty 's little table and looked down into the gift-mirror that was lying there . Then she moved heavily to the kitchen . In the instant of the door-swing Phyllis heard her mother ? in-law singing clearly , above the sound of a cream-whip in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on Christmas Day in the morning . "
