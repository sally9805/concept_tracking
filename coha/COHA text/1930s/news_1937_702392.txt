txt A gigantic program designed to make over lands in ten States and help 4,000 , - 000 persons to escape the scourge of duststorms , with their consequent ruin of the nation 's granary lands , was urged on Congress today by President Roosevelt . With a report of his Great Plains Committee mapping the strategy of a war for a " new economy " for the arid areas of the Great Plains States , the President sent a message declaring that the drought and dust storm problems could be solved , but that " the solution would take time . " He said the program should be adopted and put into effect.without undue delay . The committee , headed by Morris L. Cooke , retiring administrator of the Rural Electrification Administration , recommended a new Federal agency to work with State , local and private organizations in directing a " program of constructive action " in the region between the Canadian and Mexican borders and the Mississippi River and the Rockies . The work would be along the lines of land , economic and social readjustments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the solution of the Great Plains problem . The Great Plains committee 's report covered in detail every angle of the drought problem in Texas , Colorado , Kansas , Nebraska , Oklahoma , Montana , New Mexico , North Dakota , South Dakota and Wyoming . The work of the Federal Agency would dovetail with the proposals of the National Resources Committee " in the larger aspects of public planning , " the President said . The National Resources Committee 's report , sent to Congress a week ago , projected a six-year program of land and water control , involving $5,000,000,000 . " Depression and drought have only accentuated a situation which has long been developing , " the President said . " The problem is one of arresting the decline of an agricultural economy not adapted to the climatic conditions because of lack of information and understanding at the time of settlement , and of readjusting that economy in the light of later experience and of scientific information now available . " The committee said that public opinion in the Great Plains States was ripe for action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invoke the power of voluntary cooperation without sacrificing any of the virtues of local initiative and self-reliance . " The committee suggested that it might be wise to create a temporary agency by Executive order , pending a decision by Congress . The Great Plains Committee was appointed by the President in September , 1936 , to study the situation in the States where the drought of last year developed into a disaster of major proportions . Its work followed that of the Great Plains Drought Area Committee of 1935-1936 . " The land may bloom again if man once more makes his peace with nature , " it asserted . " Careful planting will give him back the foothill trees ; terracing will save lush foothill farms ; a wise use of the land will restore grass for controlled grazing ; fewer and larger farms on scientifically selected sites may yield under the plow a comfortable living . " Program of Joint Action It presented the following for Federal , State and - local actions : 1 . A ten-year program of additional investigations and surveys . 2 . The continued @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use of publicly owned range land in accordance with the objectives of general rehabilitation as well as of existing priorities . 3 . Measures to increase the size of farms too small for efficient operation . 4 . The development of the water resources of the arid areas , this to include small irrigation systems . 5 . Resettlement within and with out the drought zones when such resettlement appears necessary . 6 . Compensation to local governments where Federal land acquisition results in a shrinkage of the local- tax basis . 7 . The control and possible eradication of insect pests , which in 1934 did a damage in the Great Plains area estimated to be about $38 , coomo. 8 . Exploration of the possibilities of developing other resources , such as the vast lignite deposits , to provide alternative occupation for some persons . Elaborating the resettlement part of the program , the committee noted that " restless movements and counter-movements of people always have been characteristic of life in the Great Plains . " It estimated . that about 165,000 persons , or 40,000 families , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the States In the matter of action by the States the report said the Great Plains , " a land of excessive . risk in the past , " could become a- land of reasonable security . The lines of State actinn recommended are : 1 . Stikeeys and revisions of State laws , each of the States in the Great Plains area to undertake promptly a survey of - its existing laws affecting land and water conservation and use , including those relating to agricultural institutions , such as tenancy , leasing , taxation and taxdelinquency. 2 . Zoning of land for its best use , the Legislatures of the Great Plains States to pass acts empowering counties to zone land in terms of its proper use . Zoning would assure relative permanence to improvements brought about by other action programs . 3 . The establishment of cooperative grazing associations . 4 . Creation of districts for control of erosion on arable lands , the districts to be endowed with power to prevent the using of arable lands in such ways as to injure the welfare of the community as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the management of tax delinquent range lands under policies that would avoid automatic resale to private individuals and that would make such lands available for coordinated - use with other public lands through cooperative grazing districts or other means . 6 . Problems of taxation . States should give serious consideration to the nature , effects and possible revision of their tax situations , 7 . Facilitation of needed changes in community organization and fiscal arrangements . 8 . Water resources and water problems . Outside of public grazing districts where an expansion of grazing activity is in prospect and where water supplies are now inadequate , wells , farm ponds , small reservoirs should be provided by individual farmers or groups of ranchers . These improvements might be aided by tax reduction as in Kansas . Irrigation projects would be facilitated by the establishment of agencies such as the Montana Water Conservation Board , such agencies to cooperate with . the ' Federal agencies . 9 . Land occupancy and tenure .

Action by Local Bodies For local action the committee proposed : 1 . Enlargement of undersized operating units and establishment of cooperative grazing ranges . 2 . Major shifts in cropping plans to reduce the single cash crop and to restore the more balanced farm . 3 . Flexible cropping plans to permit the adaptation of each season 's crop to the amount of moisture in the soil at planting time . 4 . Creation of feed and seed reserves against dry years . 5 . Conservation of soil moisture by contour plowing and listing , terracing ; leaving of stubble and crop residue in the ground and the planting of seed clover and rye on sandy soils . Z. Supplemental irrigation where practicable . 7 . Fuller utilization of springs and wells where stock is to . be pastured. 8 . Planting of trees and shrubs as windbreaks in borders of miniVfited fields and around houses to minimize dust storm damage . Besides Mr. Cooke , the Great Plains Committee includes Harlan H.

THE PRESIDENT 'S MESSAGE The text of President Roosevelt 's message follows : I transmit herewith for the information of the Congress , the report of the Great Plains Committee under the title " The Future of the Great Plains , . " The report indicates clearly that the problem of the Great Plains is not merely one of relief of a courageous and energetic people who have been stricken by several years of drought during a period of economic depression . It is much more fundamental than that . Depression and drought have only accentuated a situation which has been long developing . The problem is one of arresting the decline of an agricultural economy not adapted to the climatic conditions because of lack of information and understanding at the time of settlements , and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of scientifio information now available . The settlers of the plains brought with them agricultural practices developed in the more humid regions from which they came . By historic circumstance the period of settlements was generally one of rainfall above the average , and although water was known to be scarce , the practices then appeared to be suitable : The long-run experience , however , has disclosed that the rainfall of the area hovers around and , for considerable periods , falls below the critical point at which it is possible to grow crops by the agricultural methods common to humid regions . Cites Report on Resources A new economy must be developed which is based on the conservation and effective utilization of all the water available , especially that which falls as rain and snow ; an economy which represents generally a more rational adjustment of the organization of agriculture and cropping plans and methods to natural conditions . The whole subject of drought on the Great Plains dovetails into the studies made by the National Resources Committee in the larger aspect of public works planning . Previous and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a nation-wide basis . In this report they have been re-worked and applied by the Great Plains Committee in cooperation with other Federal agencies and with State and regional planning agencies as a component part of our desire to develop a program of constructive action for the drought area . Whatever program is adopted must be cooperative and will require complementary lines of action by the Federal Government , State governments and all the citizens of the region individually . Each has material interests at stake and can no longer afford to defer constructive action ; each has moral- responsibility ? for unwitting contributions to the causes of the present situation ; and- especially each has responsibility for undertaking lines of action essential to ' effectiveness of action- by the - others . The problem Is one that can be solved , but the solution will take time . Therefore , a policy should be determined , a long-run program formulated , and execution begun without undue delw .
