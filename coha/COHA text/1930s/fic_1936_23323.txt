qffq-v-A9 QUALITY OF MERCY A STORY BY G. B. STERN rr Jus-r happened that Pauline Ferrars and Jim Meade were in London at the same time . Usually one was in Devonshire and the other in Capri . It happened too that Sherwood complained he had never been asked to my flat , which was his form of carrying the war into the enemy 's country ; certainly one never asked him , as nine times out of ten he was too busy with what is formidably called " important research . " When I asked him to name his own day he chose the same day as when Jim and Pauline were already coming . Gavin Sherwood had never met Bob ; and , gastronomically speaking , none of them had ever met my cook . She was a gaunt reliable woman in her forties , full of respectable axioms uttered in a deep warning voice like the toning of a bell for the dead ; but she knew her job , and my guests used to eat a meal prepared by her , with short sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrusting the food away abstractedly while they talked of other things . A fortnight ago she had been called away to the bedside of a sick mother ; but now it seemed to me , callously speaking , that her mother should be either much better or else resigned to the fact that she must be ill with only five of her daughters instead of six clustering at her bedside ; for Gunn had told me that she was one of six : " all girls " she added in a somber sort of way . Six daughters , six beautiful daughters , six romantic littleprincesses  --  well , no , that was unlikely ; six cooks like Gunn . I sent a telegram saying , " Urgent lunch party Wednesday please return Tuesday unless quite impossible . " Pauline was a connoisseur of food ; and so probably was Sherwood , after the forty-five years he had spent courteously receiving the best of everything because no one would be likely to give him anything second-rate . Jim of course , in spite of his recent leap into fame with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good old-fashioned mother , and I should say his appetite was hearty but unsophisticated . Anyhow , concentrating on the matter of lunch , I interviewed Gunn immediately on her return . She was looking rather more gaunt than ever , with a curiously neurotic streak which had not been there before , but was , I suppose , the result of too much night-nursing . I told her I wanted one of her perfect fillet steaks ; that short thick kind , so proud and tender it falls apart at mere sight of the knife , forestalling the indignity of being cut , and reveals itself delicately flushed within , with little juicy spurts of red gravy . These steaks were our specialty . We had had homeric battles with our butcher before he finally realized that we would accept a fillet steak no degree inferior to perfection itself . Often we left him ; then allowed ourselves to be seduced back again , winningly , gradually . Nevertheless , for this luncheon party , 1 was taking no risks : " Give him to-morrow 's order to-day , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Send us up the best , and I 'll cat up the other in the evening . " Gunn nodded gloomily . " And what about the entry ? " she queried , as one might say , What about the winding-sheet ? " And the fish and the sweet ? " 1 ordered a rather complicated entr  --  e ; cut out the fish , and altered the sweet to a sharp but subtle savory . Then I selected a bottle of the 1906 Chateau Haut Brion , and sat down reposefully , feeling I had done all that was possible beforehand toward making the lunch a proud success . My three guests arrived punctually . Gavin Sherwood was in one of his most charming humors . You forgot that he was a great scientist ; you forgot he was a traveler , a cynic , a man of the world in the deeper sense of the phrase ; and only remembered how much you always liked him in your rare encounters , and wondered why legend had created little mysterious circles of darkness and awe round his name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " alchemist " behind it ; and an alchemist was one who used power of magic . Pauline was looking lovely , but she was strangely over-excited and talked too much , flinging the phrases about a little wildly , carelessly , as though in the hope that where six went wide of the mark , the seventh might brilliantly encircle it and win a cheer from the three of us . I could see that Jim , though shy at first , found her enchanting , and I remembered with amusement that he had said over the telephone when I had invited him to this lunch , " I say ! Lady Pauline ! I say , I 've wanted to meet her ever since I saw her in a box at the theater and Rogerson pointed her out to me and said , ' Look at that woman up there , with the glorious shoulders . She 's one of the most dangerous women alive . If ever you meet her , Jim , look out ! ' And now she 's going to be at your lunch . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the innocent fields and lanes of Devonshire , in an atmosphere of honeysuckle and cream , apple-pudding and a mother 's devotion , it was plain that Jim toyed meeting " one of the most dangerous women alive . " Lunch was announced , and we floated gaily through what Gunn called the entry . " " You 've got a cook , " remarked Sherwood with appreciation . " Not just a plain cook , or a cook-who-does-her-best , or a cook who 'll do until you get another , but a cook . " And Pauline chimed in , " We 'll draw lots for her presently . A mere painter like Judith does n't deserve her . And if either of you two men get her , and not me , I 'll have to marry you . " Jim flushed crimson . So it was true , this delightful woman was dangerous ! He marvelled at her daring and marvelled even more at the spirit of calm amusement in Sherwood 's reply to the challenge : " And if you should draw the lucky number , Pauline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a trio ? " Pauline shook her head , and her voice became husky and tantalizing as she said , " There would have to be , I think , a little tactful elimination . " I did not hear any more of the dialogue , for just then Lucy brought in the steak and set it down before me to carve . At first sight it seemed one of those things that were too bad to be true . This steak did not stand arrogantly thick and obviously tender , waiting merely for a breath of the knife hovering above it to fall into succulent juicy slices . This steak cringed low and flat to the plate , though it bumped away from it in places . It was a pallid steak , looking as though it had been kept under a mattress for days and had never had enough praise or encouragement . Moreover , it was veined by branches of what looked horribly like gristle . Too bad to be true . Probably I was mistaken . Probably when I began to carve it . I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but I thought I saw beneath the parlormaid 's mask a flicker of honest woman-to-woman sympathy . The others were talking , chaffing one another in the interim between two courses of what could not fail to be an excellent , well-chosen lunch . I began to carve . My knife made no impression anywhere . It would not begin to cut through the tough veins of gristle . I tried another place on the steak . No good . I twisted the dish still farther round . Then I began again on the first portion . For all the impression that my carving made on that steak , I might have been reciting Milton to a person deaf from birth . This was nightmare . One could not go on and on and on into eternity , hacking away at an unresponsive piece of meat , while one 's visitors talked their brilliant flippancies , noticing nothing . Nightmare . It was useless to question how this direful thing had happened now that I was actually engaged in the tussle . Afterward I would let my thoughts roam free , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on butchers and cooks . But for the moment .. . I made another onslaught , turning the dish round again to present the knife with yet another angle of that horrible steak . This was nonsense ; I simply had to give them something to eat besides the entr  --  e and the savory . It would not cut . The gay , casual dialogue was naturally dying down . I would have to say something , explain , apologize . . . or I could faint , of course ; that would create a diversion . Downstairs in the kitchen was , I remembered , an alternative steak . I had told Gunn to get two . It could not be worse than this one . It might be better . But by what means could a hostess unobtrusively waft one steak off the dish , and another , hot and deliciously grilled , on to it ? The air about me grew hotter and things buzzed in my ears , while hopelessly I sawed away , and in the reigning silence wondered when it could end , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke . Gavin 's voice . What he said was incredible , " Judith , I 've been watching you for a long time . I 've never seen anyone quite so helpless . You know , it 's a perfectly easy matter to carve a piece of steak . " All my suppressed agony flared into temper  --  and broke . " If it 's so easy , " I retorted laughing ( I was able to laugh now ) , " then please , Gavin , do it yourself . I 'd hate to stop you . " Politely I handed him the carvers ; equally politely he returned them . " No , no , I 'm your guest . I 'm here to eat , not to carve . Besides , I enjoy watching you . I had no idea anyone could try so many things with one piece of steak . " " But it 's tough , " I confessed ruefully . The situation was normal now , the tension slack , the fever-patient cool and easy . Pauline usually took a line of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ follow closely on Gavin 's initiative ; she began to chaff me hilariously on the toughness of the steak and my inability to cope with it . She overdid the matter badly of course , but I did not care . All my coherent thoughts were quenched in a rush of silent gratitude toward Sherwood . Give me a man of the world to estimate exactly the right moment , and use the perfect light inflection , to come to the rescue ; his mature knowledge told him that hospitality was temporarily in a hole ; and that the only way out of it , the only kindness , was for him to mock openly . I might have gone on hacking at that steak forever . In spite of Jim 's agitated ripple of polite assertion that the steak was very nice indeed he liked steak like that it was his favorite kind of steak and what could be nicer than steak ? , we decided to leave it alone and make up on the savory , cheese , and dessert . The 1906 Chateau Haut Brion was a mellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The luncheon party worked out as a distinct success , and I was sorry to see them all go . Jim stayed on a little longer than the other two , and allowed his shyness to disperse in simple friendliness and special efforts to make me aware how much he had enjoyed himself . " You must come down to Spendicott soon for a weekend . I 'd like you to see the fuchsias in bloom . My cousins are staying with us now ; you know my cousins , do n't you ? Diana Leighton and her father . He 's not at all well , poor chap . His doctor 's sending him on a trip to California . " " Oh ? " Hamyll Leighton was one of my pet aversions : a picturesque , self-adoring sentimentalist . " Is Diana going with him ? " " I do n't think so . She 's so keen on her job . Diana 's very clever , considering she 's so pretty . She passed her examinations with special mention . I wish in a way , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so terribly . She 's the apple of his eye , poor old chap . It would be nice if you could come down before he left ; he 's always asking after you and told me he wanted to be kindly remembered . Mother sent you her love . " Jim was one of those people who would always remember to deliver remembrances , kind regards , and love . He carried little bundles of these verbal post cards , and left them consistently at the right addresses . I listened dreamily to his farewell speeches ; for somehow or other the luncheon party , pleasant though it had been except for those few awful moments , had left me extraordinarily sleepy . I decided that I would not speak to Gunn till next morning . That evening my husband unexpectedly came to dine with me . If this sounds like a somewhat startling statement , I may mention , in brackets , that we had had a more than usually futile argument six weeks before . I think it was about my neglecting him for my career , caring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bed of roses . Anyhow he had gone off , in a manly rage , to stay at his Club . The alternative steak was brought in and set before me to carve . I looked at it . . . and even before I picked up thecarving-knife , felt that I knew now , if never before , what irony could do . " My God , Judith , " remarked Terry , a few moments later , " this is the most per-fect steak I 've ever lapped up . It simply cuts itself . " " Yes . It does , does n't it ? " The next morning he moved home again , with his suitcase . It was clear to him that painting aldermen and poets , in alternate streaks of profit and pleasure , had not , after all , wholly unfitted me for domesticity and supplying the wants of the epicurean male . And the next morning I interviewed Gunn . It was not a very satisfactory interview . Her attitude puzzled me . It was neurotic and defiant . It conveyed that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , nevertheless , was not sorry that she had done it . She would not answer direct indictment . Surely , I asked , she must have noticed beforehand the difference between the two steaks ? She shook her head stupidly , uttering wild sea-bird mewings about her mother , and collapsed into harsh crying . This style of behavior continued for a few weeks and made us all extremely uncomfortable . Though no actual catastrophe occurred , as over the steak , she would cook marvellously as of old for a few days , and then her style would degenerate again into blurs of scrambled eggs and dowdy statements of stew . Finally she blurted out her notice with some incomprehensible charges against me , and marched out . I should never have understood the whole affair but for my sewing-woman , who had been a friend of Gunn 's , originally imported by her to do occasional jobs of mending . Popping pins in and out of her mouth , she informed me chattily that Gunn 's mother was a myth . Gunn 's mother had died twenty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Devon . " A farmer , I believe , or some such . She was crazy about him ; spent her holiday there every year . Well , they do sometimes at her age , do n't they ? I mean  --  is that sleeve too tight above the elbow ? Yes , I 1 thought it was  --  I mean it takes them like that , sort of last chance , that 's what I always call it . . . yes , I can widen it with a piece out of the sash ; we do n't need all that stuff in the sash , do we ? Makes it bulky just where you do n't want it . . . . But she heard some rumor he was going to be married , and down she had to dash , though what she hoped from just reminding him what she looked like in case he 'd been and forgotten . . . but there , as I said , poor soul , she was n't quite in her right mind about him . And when you sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said she would n't go , for all he wanted to be rid of her before his new young lady was to hear of the fuss . But she came back all upside-down in her mind and not feeling any too friendly toward you , Mrs. Maitland , nor your luncheon party ; feeling right-down nasty , in fact . So out she went and ordered two steaks , one cheap cut from the wrong end for the servants , she said ; for stewing , she said ; and the other to send up to the dining room . And then sent up the bad one on purpose . Revengeful , I call it ; and I told her so when she told me afterward , but she 'd got to a state she did n't seem to care what anyone thought of her . No , I do n't know where she is now , but he 's married to his new young lady and they 're getting on a treat , I hear , so in a roundabout way , he ought to be grateful to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people already had benefited from my little luncheon party : my husband and an unknown farmer-or-some-such in Devon . I wondered idly if there were any more links on that chain ? Then suddenly I received a cluster of very profitable commissions in New York and Chicago ; and in the haste of preparation I thought no more of poor Gunn and her gaunt tragedy . From Chicago I went on to Hollywood to paint Mr. Arthur N. Wyckoff , head of the A.B.G. studios , Mr. Simon Ruscoe of World-Studios , and six out of seven of the Sachs Brothers . At a party at Santa Monica , I was introduced to a Mrs. Burford B. Chandos , and discovered it was Diana Leighton , Jim 's pretty cousin . When she was seventeen , the child had had a rave on me ; and though she was  --  how old now ? ? twenty-two or twenty-three , she showed symptoms of remembering I had been a good listener , and of wishing to unburden herself of fresh confidences . So we wandered out through the garden and down to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Diana did not look exactly radiant , but she seemed serene enough , as though she had grown up and learned to manage , psychologically speaking ; and this I approved of . These Peter Pan girls and Peter Pan boys who never quite get the hang of facts are liable to be boring once they are over twenty-one . Diana 's husband was the protective , rugged type . A banker , she told me , and rich ; neither too thin nor too fat " And one ca n't have everything , " Diana summed up the situation . I shrugged my shoulders . " One can have practically nothing . " " I 'm not in love with him but he 's kind , " defiantly from Diana . Kind ? I wondered . We had previously exchanged a few words , and he had bellowed genially , in compliment to my career , " I expect a lot of women would exchange their looks for your talent , Mrs. Maitland ! " " I suppose you would say kindness was a lukewarm sort of quality , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right , all right , my child , and many happy returns . Shall I paint him for you , or you for him , as my wedding-present ? " " Have you ever painted a portrait of Gavin Sherwood ? " she asked , off on Godknows-what tangent . Talking of cynics perhaps . " No . He 's never had time for it ; too occupied with his research and so forth . I will when he retires . He has the sort of fine head that grows finer as it slowly silvers . Are you in love with Gavin ? " I added casually . For I had seen her eyes as I spoke of his good looks . " I was . I 'd have died for him . " I waited . " We were all mad about him , all the students I mean , when I was at St. John 's . And then he needed an assistant just after I had got through my final exam and was qualified to take the job if I could get it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know . . . In our interview , I could tell he liked me . Oh , he was so sweet ; absolutely businesslike and practical , but I could tell ! To help him in his experiments , to serve him . . . Writers are always jabbering about what propinquity will do  --  a horrid word  --  but they 're right ; a hundred chances a day of being alone together , instead of once every three months or so , and then only mixed up with a lot of social stuff and rabble and gabble . Judith , he wrote and offered me the job . It was to start almost at once . Daddy was going to California ; poor sweet , he was n't at all well . He 's splendid now ; have you seen him to-night  --  Oh , well bit brokenhearted . But I simply could n't , I could n't think of anything but Gavin , and what I 'd be able to do for Gavin and do with Gavin for all the years of my life . Suddenly father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're coming with me to California , child , ' he said . He said he would n't leave me behind , working for a man like that . And he said , ' Sherwood 's a cruel type . ' " For no reason that I could discover in myself , I flushed and spoke angrily , " That 's a lie ! " " It 's true , " said Diana . This was a shock . I was prepared for the girl to be loyal and stormy and challenging and schoolgirlish ; to declare , perhaps over-dramatically , that she had had to give in to her father because he was ill , but she would never cease to believe in Gavin . But that curious , stony " It 's true , " provoked all the long-forgotten schoolgirl in myself . " What do you mean by ' it 's true ' ? " " What he did to Pauline . . . was cruel . " " Did he do anything to Pauline ? I did n't know that he and Pauline ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been in love with him for years , only it was getting worse and worse . Did n't you know that ? Judy , do n't you ever see anything ? " " Not a damn thing . " But suddenly that lunch drifted back into my memory , and I saw Pauline in a tumult of glory and over-excitement , breathlessly intent on Gavin , shining for him , glowing for him ; even , in that strange way of love , copying him , using his phrases , his tone of voice ; catching at his opinions , gilding them . Yes , Diana was quite right and I had been blind . Pauline was in love with the man . But ? cruel ? I asked Diana how he had been cruel to Pauline . " She showed me his letter . " I ceased to be sorry for Pauline . She should not have shown Diana any letter from Gavin . Oh , well , I do n't know ; why condemn her to be priggish and austere and reticent when she was feeling like hell ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where and how we can . It was a very short letter . Diana repeated the gist of it , gazing into the dark water of the swimming-pool as though she were reading it off from there : " He said that he was n't going to see her any more , ever . Except of course if it happened so that he could n't help it ; but he hardly ever goes to parties , and she 's in Capri such a lot , so it could be avoided . And he was going to avoid it because she had become dangerous to him . She was on his mind too much . And then  --  oh , I forget just how brutally he put it  --  his work and alI that ; he was n't going to expose himself . He wrote that she was the only woman in the world whom he need avoid , who could ever disturb him in that way . It was a hateful letter ! " " I 'm not so sure . " I was a little breathless . " You 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it means to Pauline , never seeing him again ? And because she was the only person in the world who was ' dangerous ' to him , and he did n't want to be ' disturbed . ' " Diana 's voice was tense with indignation . But I was unreasonably elated , as though I were on the trail of something so important that I had no usual measure to gauge it by . Yes , here it was , the same note as before over that infernally tough steak , only deeper , fuller this time ; responding to a much more urgent need . It was thrilling to recognize it , as thrilling as to find on some old map the mark of buried treasure : " Here lies much gold . " For Gavin Sherwood did not love Pauline . Yet he realized that she could not go on like that , restless , tormented , doubting ; manufacturing false evidence that he cared for her , destroying it again . So he gave her the blessing of complete certainty in what she most needed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world who could be " dangerous " to him , who could " disturb " him , who meant so much already that he dared take no risks . What better could he do for her ? Here , in this letter he had written , was a whole relief expedition ; here was ointment for throbbing vanity , rescue for self-respect . Compare the quiet dove-colored sorrow that Pauline could now hold clasped always to her breast with the agony that a man of thicker sensibility might have left her with forever . I would gladly have shouted aloud my discovery to Diana , but I restrained the impulse , remembering that this was exactly what Gavin would not have done : the quality of his mercy would forbid it ; would leave Diana still regretting nothing , still thinking him no hero , but a callous ruffian . I could pay Gavin no higher tribute than in all humility to imitate his manner of kindness . And I wanted to be like Gavin ; since my discovery I wanted it childishly ; after all , I could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And one must do something . So I merely said , " I have n't seen Pauline for some time . Did she seem terribly unhappy after this letter ? " " Well  --  no , she did n't . No , " repeated Diana , surprised , " she did n't . Pauline is so gallant . " The sentimental little goose sent her voice ringing out on the warm blossomy air . " Oh , Diana darling , do n't ! " " Do n't what ? " " Use words like that . " " ' Gallant ' happens to be my favorite word , " said Diana , not yielding an inch of her dignity , though she would rejoicingly have thrown me into the pool . She was a serious young thing , Diana , and always would be , and very , very pretty . And brains , too ; look how well she had passed her biology examinations . Chan-dos was a lucky man . Between us , Gavin Sherwood and I , we had to-day given that kind , protective husband such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protective husbands whose wives were only just reluctantly beginning to love them . " Diana , just tell me , how did your father come to hear about this Pauline business before you did ? " Making a thoroughly good job out of slaying Gavin , Diana icily supposed he had been " talking about it at the club . " Later on in the evening I ran into Hamyll Leighton , Diana 's father , looking , as she had said , tall , ruddy , handsome , and splendid . After we had discussed his health , his suggestions for improving California and other irrelevant topics , I congratulated him on Diana 's marriage . Immediately I was drowned out in a flood of " My little girl " stuff : My little daughter ; my only little daughter ; my one little girl , and " **43;341;TOOLONG . " " Chandos is a good fellow . He 'll look after my little girl . You 're an artist , Mrs. Maitland , and artists , I know , have to be hard in this modern world . So @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kindness means happiness , and happiness means kindness . " I nodded and tried to look like a hard artist in a modern world being persuaded against my hard modern judgment that kindness is happiness and happiness is the Bluebird and the Bluebird was the exclusive property of Diana 's Old Daddy . " By the way , " he added , " in a roundabout fashion , we owe it all to you . " " To me ? " I was puzzled . " To Pauline surely ? " " Who 's Pauline ? Ah , yes , yes , I think I 've heard my little girl speak of her : Lady Pauline Ferrars . And I 've seen her photograph too in The Tatter . Not quite my style . Too raffish . No , what I meant to say  --  have you ever noticed how small things are responsible for quite big ones ? If my cousin , Jim Meade , had n't warned me so seriously against Sher-wood --  " " Jim ? But I thought Jim liked him . They met at my house once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his way ; very little passes him by . When this question came up , while we were staying with him , that my little girl should accept a job as laboratory assistant to Professor Sherwood , she was delighted at the honor ; and her old father was n't going to raise objections . The young must make way for the old , " he continued , placing his exemplary sentiments the wrong way round , and not noticing the mistake . " And though this might have been my last voyage , and it would have meant so much to me to have had my only little daughter with me ? " ( He was looking well ) " She rebelled at first when I told her the truth , lovingly but sternly , Mrs. Maitland ; for often love and severity are twin archangels whom we can not distinguish apart . ' I have learnt something about this man , little daughter , ' I said . No father worthy the name would leave his child exposed to such a close intimacy unless he were completely satisfied as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ however famous , however honorable his career , could he be trusted , not only in deed , but in his influence ? The dangers of propinquity I You see , Mrs. Maitland , you have to be a man of the world , not a dreamy artist ? " ( So I was suddenly dreamy , not hard and modern any longer ! ) " You have to be a man of the world to realize what propinquity may lead to . And she would have been with him day in day out . " " Surely only day in ? " He shook his head at my flippancy ; a picturesque head with thick wavy hair . " It 's no joke to be responsible for an only little daughter , you know . Though she 's a gallant child , a very gallant child . And after the first blow she suddenly made up her mind to take the disappointment beautifully . ' I can not let you accept this position with him , little daughter .

I had grunted . In this instance it was a more polite and safer way of saying , " Yes , and were n't you glad to have any excuse to drag Diana along with you , you good-looking Thanksgiving turkey stuffed with sage and selfishness ? " He beamed at me benevolently ; Hamyll Leighton was not good at guessing thoughts " And out here I recovered my health , and she met Chandos , and he fell in love with her , and she married him , and you see it 's turned out well for everybody ! And that 's why I wanted to thank you , Mrs. Maitland , for unconsciously helping to bring it all about . " But the point of his gratitude still eluded me . And there was another point too on which he had forgotten to enlighten me . For if it were not Gavin 's behavior to Pauline " What did Jim tell you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough nature to be trusted with Diana ? " " Ah yes . He told me  --  the little things , Mrs. Maitland , the little things are straws that show the way the wind blows ! ? he told me that Sherwood was once terribly cruel to you about a piece of steak . "
