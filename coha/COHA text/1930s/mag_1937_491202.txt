SEATTLE is a conservative city . The radicals there are conservative . They gained physical control of Seattle last June , but they have governed it mildly . You transact business in Seattle today by courtesy of the longshoremen . You exist there by kindness of the longshoremen . Every breath of air you draw there is by special arrangement with the longshoremen . For more than six months , Seattle has been under a sort of martial law by longshoremen . They disliked Mr. Hearst 's Post-Intelligencer and closed it down . They disapproved of certain business houses and shut them up . Few absolute rulers , however , have ever conducted themselves with the moderation of the Seattle longshoremen . Mayor John F. Dore , the frankest and bluntest man in American politics , took office in Seattle last June . He is a prophet of revolution . He has made speeches promising livelier times in this country than the French had in the days of Danton and Robespierre . The mayor , like many other politicians in his region , foresees a joyous upheaval ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good time had by all . The prophets of revolution in the Northwest are not prophets of doom but forecasters of a millennium . Their revolution is to be a Mardi Gras or prolonged New Year 's Eve . They are as elated as Swinburne was when he erroneously hailed " the imminence of immeasurable insurrection " ; the Northwest phrase for it is " Boy , this country is going places . " Mayor Dore , as a local patriot , wanted to see his home town get off to a flying start in the glorious new era . The police stepped aside , and the water front  --  locally called Skid Row  --  took charge . Citizens expected to be chased off the streets with bale hooks and harpoons , and they were startled to find the Skid Row despotism rather benevolent . Skid Row makes a demonstration now and then in the form of a wall of human flesh . When Skid Row decided to censor Mr. Hearst , it threw a wall of human flesh around the Post , Intelligencer offices . It threw walls ofhuman flesh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other establishments . This used to be called " riot " or " unlawful assembly , " but it is " mass picketing " now . But the power which the longshoremen acquired in the . Tune revolution has been used sparingly . They do n't seem to like the mandate to govern Seattle : they are nearly as standoffish as the United States was when the League of Nations tried to hand us the mandate to run Armenia . The whole region is conservative , It is true that the state of Washington voted overwhelmingly for the New Deal and elected liberals to Congress , but at the same time it voted down a series of radical proposals . A Production-for-Use measure authorizing the state to seize and operate factories was beaten by a landslide . A radical public-ownership measure was slaughtered . The only referendum that was approved by the voters was a high Tory measure , a property-protecting scheme , forbidding tax rates to be increased more than forty mills on the dollar . The voters refused to let the state of Washington be the laboratory for radical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be the guinea pig , but not our state . " The teamsters and longshoremen were extremely powerful even before the June revolution made them the ruling class . The main business of Seattle is transportation . Industrial cities have a variety of unions , each jealous of its own jurisdiction and ready to resist encroachment by other unions ; a system of checks and balances usually develops which prevents any one union or two unions from growing overwhelmingly powerful . But in Seattle transportation overshadows other activities , and the transportation unions overshadow other labor organizations . The teamsters and longshoremen have no rivals . They dominate and protect weaker unions . They have become extremely active in organizing new unions , and their aim is " to make Seattle a 100 per cent closed-shop town . " The Seattle teamsters formerly claimed jurisdiction over nearly everything on wheels ; today they seek to organize everybody in Washington who makes or handles any product that is carried on wheels . The bakers , laundrymen , cleaners and dyers , milkmen , brewers and wholesale-grocery employees , to give a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ houses are longshoremen . Some residents of Seattle claim that their cooks and nursemaids are secret longshoremen . Skid Row has even broken into belles-lettres through its control of the Newspaper Guild . In spite of the long-established power of the longshoremen and teamsters and their freshly acquired power of last . June , there are various obstacles in the way of Mayor Dore 's improved French Revolution . The very strength of the unions is a standpat factor . The labor machine is enmeshed with the political machine . With his influence over votes , the labor leader is a natural political leader . There are in Seattle unworldly labor leaders who serve their cause with priestlike devotion ; there are others who serve the cause , but take some advantage of their opportunities . Political pickings are a stabilizing factor ; easy money tends to prejudice the politician in favor of the status quo . The state of Washington forbids the sale of hard liquor by the glass , and so the speakeasy still survives and flourishes in Seattle . It is not necessary to tell anybody who lived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they pay for protection . The greatest source of offside political profit , however , is the income from gambling , particularly from slot machines . The money machine is very popular in Seattle and its environs , although the odds are heavily against the player . A French Revolution would ruin all this . The speak-easy graft and the slot-machine graft are among the checks and balances in the Seattle situation . Men who are masters of the art of local government are seldom revolutionists at heart . Seattle 's Labor , and  --  Capital Alliances I NSTEAD of seeking to destroy capitalism . Seattle unionism seeks to marry it and settle down . There is more of Mark Hanna than Karl Marx in the typical Seattle labor leader . The trend is toward Old Guard economics rather than toward Socialism . Instead of setting up Soviets , Seattle is setting up labor-and-capital alliances with two dominant policies  --  a soak-the-consumer policy and a **31;1059;TOOLONG policy . The principle of the thing is old enough . In earlier days it might have been called a ring , trust , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a conspiracy in restraint of trade . In Al Capone 's Chicago , it was a racket . Under the Blue Eagle , it was a code . In Seattle it is " a voluntary NRA . " Mayor Dore is a former conservative recently turned radical . He was first elected mayor in 1932 , a year of revolt by the propertied class against high taxes . He ran on an economy platform and he carried it out to the letter . As mayor . he cut his own salary and those of all department heads ; he slashed the pay of the police and firemen and all other city employees . The businessmen of Seattle hailed him as one of the coming men of . America , but they gave him only languid support when he came up for re-election in 1934 , and he was beaten by the votes of labor . Mr. Dore ran again in 1936 , with some support from the business community , but he had reason to suspect the Seattle businessman of being a sluggard and incompetent in politics ; he made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ iu his favor . They did not like his record , but they knew him for a man of his . word . He promised a labor admiuistra tion , ' and-he made good . With his usual bluntness he said , " Brother Dave Beck was the greatest factor in my election , and-I say again I am going to pay back my debt to Dave Beck and the teamsters in the next two years , regardless of what happens . " The mayor paid his debt by allowing the teamsters and longshoremen to use their own brand of martial law in Seattle . Further than that , he chilled . the blood of conservatives by a series of speeches predicting the overthrow of current institutions and substitution of a brave new world . Johnny Dore was one of the leading trial lawyers of the Northwest . He belongs ' to the pitchfork school of oratory . A celebrated roarer and flame thrower of the criminal courts , he carries his obstreperous eloquence into politics , blasting his antagonists as if they were witnesses against some of his clients of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to name over some of the leading members of the Chamber of Commerce and drain the Cloaca Maxima of his vocabulary on them . He excoriates them for exercise . It amuses him and quiets the old homesickness for the criminal bar . If he makes a speech and fails to describe some of the first citizens as white-slavers , embezzlers and unfrocked pawnbrokers , the people say , " Johnny was n't at his best last night . " There is a movement by citizens of Seattle to recall their vivacious burgomaster , and if he is removed he could probably cut a figure in the nation . He does not suffer from the inhibitions and the Nice Nellyism which weakened the oratory of Father Coughlin , General Johnson , the Rev. Gerald L. K. Smith and the late Huey Long . Mayor Dore is the only popularity-seeking politician who ever arraigned the fur-clad womanhood of America . When 500 women marched on the capital of Washington at Olympia , to protest against rackets in Seattle , he called them " perfumed , fur-coated hussies , " and publicly speculated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He offered the opinion that they were " addled " and that they ought to stay home and tend to their knitting . The mayor chose the University of Washington as his forum for his French Revolution speech . He chose the Chamber of Commerce as his forum for predicting the complete triumph of the closed shop and for allowing labor to carry out its program by coercion and violence . " There can't. be any such thing as a labor union without coercion , " he told them . " The word ' peaceful ' and the word ' picketing ' do n't go together , " he added . An illuminating part of his Chamber of Commerce address was his assertion that the big businessmen of his state loved the closed shop because it united them with organized labor in prico=fixing combinations . " Industry , " he said , " wants to be controlled by labor unions . " He mentioned the brewers , among others , as delighted to . be under union control , because it enabled them to " maintain a price for beer that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Which is true . You get an undersized glass of beer for a dime in Washington , anaiitisaloirin-dhres-fo eve-You a-larger helping , because it - *Mild be declared unfair and picketed . Mayor Dore added . that the . laundrymen had an agreement with union labor to fix prices , and that the laundry owners would not give up the agreeinent for a million dollars . Laundry prices , incidentally , are staggeringly high in Seattle . The Teamsters Crack the Whip SAY OR DORE 'S description of the contentment Al of certain business interests with the closed-shop and price-fixing arrangement is not overdrawn , and it is one of the reasons why the French Revolution is not in progress in Seattle . Labor unions have muscled into business , and business has horned into labor unions . Politics , business and labor are all tangled up in a highly capitalistic. and antirevolutionary combination . The longshoremen have supplied most of the personnel for labor turmoil in Seattle , because there.are usually plenty of idle men on the water front . The teamsters ' organization , however , is far more important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helps to make the teamsters powerful . It is possible to protect nonunion longshoremen at their work on the piers , but a nonunion teamster can always be trailed , caught and disciplined . The long-shore strike of 1934 was won in Seattle , Portland and San Francisco because of the support of the teamsters ; it was lost in Los Angeles because the ocean-borne freight is there loaded directly into railroad cars , so that there were no teamsters to win the battle for the longshoremen . The teamsters are particularly powerful in Seattle because they are under the leadership of Dave Beck . Beck 's prowess is acknowledged by those most furiously opposed to him . Some of his enemies will tell you that he is the ablest man in Seattle . Beck has accomplished too much by conservative methods to be greatly tempted by the revolutionary technique . He loves to negotiate . He likes to blind businessmen with statistics of their own business . He often convinces employers that he is their friend and champion . He constantly tells his organizers , " Anybody and local authorities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an outlaw and a pariah , a scab and a fink , who has no rights that an organized man is bound to respect . The union wrecking squad has the status of a posse comitatus engaged in helping the authorities to crack down on the common enemy . In Seattle today , the pickets are volunteer policemen , self-appointed cossacks . Seattle has been better dramatized , hut what is true of labor , business and politics there is true in varying degrees in most American cities today . Wishful Thinking T HERE is a certain amount of lawlessness in the hearts of some Seattle businessmen and industrialists and their sympathizers . There are employers who would like to see the situation liquidated by nightsticks , bayonets and even hemp . Conservative citizens grow eloquent in denouncing violations of the state and Federal constitutions in the interest of organized labor ; generally speaking , they would like to see both constitutions observed , with the exception of those passages which make it . difficult to run labor agitators out of town . If you talk to ten Seattle businessmen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and approval , of the way the mayor of another Northwestern city handles trouble makers . According to the standard version , the mayor  --  sometimes it is a governor and sometimes a chief of police  --  summoned a can pull a strike , but I want men who can win their points by diplomacy and common sense . " He uses boycotts , strikes and vigorous picketing , but prefers other methods , Another statement by Beck is , " The last thing that I or any other labor leader in Seattle wants is a general strike . It would ruin us . The only people that want a general strike are our enemies . " This is apparently true . The attempted general strike in 1919 resulted in a defeat that set organized labor back for years . Interviews with businessmen showed that some of them do yearn for a general strike , believing that it would rouse the population against labor and strengthen the position of the employer . Beck is antirevolutionary and anticommunistic , but wants his followers to get all that the traffic will bear , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but high-pressure leader . The Drive for a Closed.Shop Town MHE fact that union leaders have been abstemious 1 in their use of violence does not mean that they have been backward in extending their organizations . They are organizing more rapidly than at any time in history . Federal encouragement , the return of prosperity and favorable laws encourage them in their drive to make a 100 per cent closed-shop town out of Seattle . In their hurry to organize , they have adopted some unusual tactics . One new device is that of compelling employers to order their men to join unions . In one case , for example , an organizer called on one Seattle businessman and said : " We want to organize your men . " " That 's all right with me , " said the employer . " But they do n't want to join the union , " said the organizer . " What can I do about that ? " asked the employer . " Make them , " was the reply . The conversation ended with an ultimatum that all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the employer would be boycotted . The employer happened to be an undertaker ; he could not risk having " Unfair " banners borne in his funeral processions or accidents happening to his hearses . His employees signed up in five days . A similar technique was used by teamsters against automobile-repair plants last summer . They were declared unfair because their employees refused to take out teamsters ' cards . Walls of human flesh were flung around them . A state law in Washington forbids judges to issue injunctions in labor disputes . In the auto-repair-shop case , however , an injunction against pickets was obtained on the ground that . there was no labor dispute ; that relations between employer and employee had been harmonious , and that the wall of flesh was a phenomenon unrelated to any labor grievance . The teamsters then proceeded to organize effectively in the auto shops by orthodox methods . Before last June , the violence that occurred in Seattle labor troubles took a different , form . The victim was usually trailed by pickets to some unfrequented street and there beaten up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ section , they would work fast and then get away before the police arrived . The picket regarded the law as his enemy , Within the last six months or so , however , there has been a complete change of feeling on this subject . To inflict bodily harm on a nonunion man is not considered law-breaking but law-enforcing . The militant union man esteems it not only a privilege but a civic duty to manhandle an employee who tries to go through a picket line to his place of business . There is a strain of religious fanaticism or patriotic zeal in it . Any 100 per cent American who felt an inward glow and a consciousness of merit as he persecuted a German-born butcher or grocer in 1917 will be able to understand the virtuous glow experienced by a Seattle union man who takes a punch or a kick at an unorganized fellow . The attitude of both the Federal AGITATOR : No . The Constitution does n't let you . MAYOR : What good will the Constitution do you when you are dead ? Th0 agitator leaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community . The mayor becomes a sort of mythological hero over the entire Lewis and Clark country because he did n't allow the Constitution to impede him in the discharge of his duty . Other conservatives who are inflammatory orators against lawlessness and violence by organized labor become droll raconteurs when they tell you how certain smart lumber barons sprang a trap on a group of I. W. W. leaders , captured them all , gave them a splendid beating and dumped them over the Idaho border . It makes a difference whose article of the Constitution is gored . Even some of the public-spirited women who stormed the capitol of Washington at Olympia to protest against . lawlessness in Seattle betrayed a sentimental affection for lawlessness , if on their side . One of the onlookers at the housewives ' demonstration at the capitol was Frank A. Lynch , photographer , whose dismissal from the Seattle Post-I ntelligencer was one of the causes of the strike against that paper . Lynch is personally an amiable , peaceful chap , but he is a symbol of trouble to Seattle . One @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington capitol happened to spot Lynch . She pointed him out to others . Lynch became a target for angry glances , and there was a faint round of applause when one woman shouted at him , " I wish we had a rope ! " The Law and Order League Some of the solid men of Seattle , aggrieved at finding themselves on the catching end instead of pitching end of violence , have an organization called the Law and Order League . Its ambition is to egg the authorities on to enforce the law . The zeal of a few members , however , made it appear that the League was on the side of Judge Lynch . Their zeal was based on an old Pacific Coast superstition to the effect that sonic day the vigilantes are going to rise again and restore order with nooses and horse pistols . When the law failed to function in California seventy-five years ago , the vigilantes hanged the desperadoes ; many Westerners are always praying for a return of those happy days . The move by the Law and Order League @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret questionnaires to trusty citizens , inquiring what shooting-irons and cutlery they possessed , what military training they had had and whether they were ready to spring to arms when the time came . This bloodthirsty document got practically no response from those to whom it was addressed , but it caused enormous excitement in the ranks of labor . An insurrection of the oppressed middle and wealthier classes seemed imminent . For a time , the Black Shirt Menace was substituted for the Red Menace . The Black Shirts and the Reds , to describe them as they describe each other , have some curious ways of spying on each other . There has been some skirmishing with motion-picture cameras and with sound-recording machines . The sound-recorder was used by the radicals to prove that the Blacks , or Tories , were preparing for a gory counter-revolution. it had been discovered that a Law and Order League official had a shooting gallery in his basement and was inviting friends in for revolver practice . Labor representatives sneaked around to the rear of the house with the sound-recording machine and filled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were discovered , but they escaped with their machine , and the record has been played at labor rallies . The rat-tat-tat is supposed to mean that the capitalists are tired of suffering under the iron heel of oppression and the insolent spurn of contempt , and are getting ready for an armed revolt against the proletarian overlords . Camera Shy Another touch of Hollywood is furnished by the motion-picture cameras . These are the only devices that will break up a picket line . Pickets hate the cinema , for the reason that films of pickets in operation may be used later in court . Though there is no law in Seattle against labor violence today , there may be tomorrow , and then lawbreakers may be prosecuted on motion-picture evidence . In some cases , unions may be open to damage suits for forcibly closing up business houses . So , when a third-story window opens and a movie lens is trained at a picket line , there is sometimes a general scurrying for cover . When mob picketing started , Seattle experienced only a fraction of the violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , when the mob lays siege to a plant or business house , the power of the mob is too manifest to be disputed . Only a man seeking death or a month in a hospital would attempt to pierce the wall of human flesh . After a few sluggings had made this clear in the beginning , nobody opposed Sldd Row . It became unnecessary to keep the wall of human flesh on duty at all times ; it was enough to keep a skeleton force on duty ordinarily , as it was always possible to throw a small army into action on short notice . The triumph of violence was so complete that it was not necessary to maintain a parade of physical force . Mayor Dore is candid enough to describe the situation accurately , but other local officials and the state authorities are inclined to misrepresent the situation as an excuse for inaction . Their attitude is that they can not intervene until workers barred from their places of business try to go to work . Then , if there are persistent riots and broken heads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is admitting that some other arm of the government might have to interest itself . Nobody in politics in the Northwest is eager to incur the enmity of organized labor . If the situation did get much worse and the community became thoroughly aroused , it might become better politics for the governor , sheriff and district attorney ( Continued an Paso 36 ) ( Continued frame Page 34 ) to intervene than to stand aloof . The labor politicians of Seattle are in a good position to judge of that possibility , and it is undoubtedly one of the reasons why violence has been scantily used . Except for Mayor Dore , the troubles of Seattle would have attracted little attention . The country was startled by the novelty of labor 's cracking down on the only morning newspaper of a large city . It seemed a little fantastic that the Post-Intelligencer could be blotted out of eistence for three and a half months because a Hearst execu Live had fired a dramatic critic and a photographer . The avowed reason for the strike was that . the critic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Newspaper Guild . However , it is also true that the Post-Intelligencer had been exposing the labor-capital , price-fixing combinations that raised the cost of necessities in Seattle , and that it had been attacking the enormous gambling-machine industry as a source of political graft . Back of a Strike With the Post-Intelligencer strike settled , as the result of a Hearst capitulation that included the hiring of Franklin D. Roosevelt 's young son-in-law , John Boettiger , as new publisher . and an announcement that the President 's daughter , the former Anna Roosevelt Dall , would be women 's editor , a number of things about the curious business are still not clear . But nobody disputes the fact that the Seattle Newspaper Guild could not have closed the newspaper without the longshoremen and dockmen who formed their wall of human flesh around the plant . Official Seattle gave its support to this stranglehold on the paper . Unofficial Seattle made no violent protest , because the Post-Intelligencer was disliked , partly because of its attacks on the New Deal , but chiefly because local pride had been hurt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . chain . The usual " racket " or " voluntary NRA " arrangement in Seattle provides for maintaining prices and preventing any new competitor from opening a business . The policing is done by the union , which boycotts price cutters or new competitors . The system sometimes goes further . In one ease , as described by an insider , an organizer called a conference of nine businessmen and made certain demands . He added , " We can make this worth your while . There are thirteen concerns in your business . That is too many . If your nine firms will come to terms with us , we will eliminate the other four . How will we do it ? Simply by making rules and regulations compelling them to have so many employees that , with their small businesses , the costs will sink them . " This particular offer was declined , but there has been a high mortality among small firms in highly unionized lines of business . The union organizer dictates to business in other ways . One large supply house , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trucking firm , which was paid by weight , systematically exaggerated the weight of goods delivered . The supply house arranged to have its trucking done by another trucking concern . Labor organizers said " No . " They threatened to boycott both the supply house and the new trucking firm , if any change were made . Another man who felt the effect of union power in Seattle was an experienced executive who was engaged for $350 a month and commission to act as sales manager for a chain of bakeries . His appointment was canceled by a union chief , who said , " If that bakery chain needs a sales manager , we will supply him one of our men . " The experienced executive was dropped ; the union had no man with executive training for the position ; the head of the bakery chain had to act as his own sales manager . There are many difficulties to hurdle before Seattle is 100 per cent closed shop . Union labor has had some setbacks . The hotel employees ' organization , for example , was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were all ready to strike ; it was announced that , if they struck , the Shriners would not hold their scheduled convention in Seattle . Indignant public opinion forced the cancellation of the strike plans , and the hotel workers have never wholly recovered from this reverse . A Boycott That Works in Reverse One thorn in the side of organized labor is Lloyd Mitchell , who runs a string of thirty-two bakeries in Seattle with nonunion men . Unsuccessful efforts have been made for years to organize his men . He has been beaten , shot at and boycotted . His headquarters are across the street from the Seattle Labor Temple . In addition to picketing his shops with " Unfair " signs , the union erected a large electric sign on the Labor Temple proclaiming Mitchell 's bakeries unfair . last summer the sign worked badly and became unreadable . Mitchell called up the Labor Temple and asked them to have the sign fixed . His chain of bakeries had expanded and flourished , and he asserts that the boycott has been of untold advertising value to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a buyers ' strike . The 500 women who traveled to the state capitol to protest against price-raising rackets caused a good deal of worry to Seattle politicians . This demonstration occurred in the latter stages of the campaign , and there was a tendency to discount . it as a Republican political maneuver , but it is possible that the insurrection of the fur-clad women may become effective . The end of the world does not appear to be impending in Seattle or in the state of Washington . Business picked up steadily throughout 1936 until the coastwise shipping strike in November . In the opinion of bond purchasers , the state of Washington is not headed for disaster ; the state 's credit has been steadily rising , as indicated by the premiums on its bonds . Many businessmen say that the continuation of present conditions and the threat that they may be aggravated are curtailing investment in Seattle . You hear on every side of large industries which intended to build plants in Seattle , but which have canceled their plans or are holding them in abeyance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far off , but predictions of a slackening of the growth of the city may not be fantastic . announcer up in the booth is rapping out : " Through the Labyrinth . . . . In the straightaway . . . . They 're bobbing . . . . Here they come . " You hear a faint rattle that quickly swells into a roar . The crowd leans forward , gripping its seats . The sled shoots into sight . There 's a flashing glimpse of the top of four helmets high up on the wall . They 're gone . The crowd leans back and sighs in relaxation . We are beginning to have bobsled galleries in America . The sport really started in this country with the Winter Olympics of 1932 . The Mt . Van Hoevenberg Run was built for the games . Its engineer was a German , Stanislaus Zentzytski ; the construction of bob runs being at that time unknown to us . It 's something like the planning of a golf course . The idea is to penalize mistakes , to place the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take one just right , you 've no time to recover control before the next . Of course , they do n't mean to kill you if you make a mistake . In theory , the walls are high enough to give a margin of safety to the sled that 's out of control . Only , as you 've seen , the theory does n't always work . Thousands of spectators went up to the Adirondacks in ' 32 to see what international winter sports were like . The biggest crowd went to the bob run  --  one day there were 14,000 of them there . The racing that they saw was n't quite up to first class . A bad-weather jinx hovered over the mountains that winter and the bob run was paved with slush . But the crowd saw enough speed to realize that a new thrill had come to America  --  a sport that was as exciting as football and as dangerous as automobile racing . Both the four-man and the two-man events were won by American sleds , in spite of the fact that the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an American sport . Every year larger crowds went up to watch the North American championships and the other races . There 's a group of drivers like those who make the European circuit . It 's not confined as much as it is in the Alps to wealthy sportsmen of leisure . The local boys in the Adirondacks have learned racing . In a big event , one sled may be piloted by a millionaire who has driven over from his forty-room hunting lodge , and the next by the local butcher . Last year 's two-man event in the North American was won by a borrowed sled driven by the boy who carries the special-delivery letters from the Lake Placid post office . Mt .. Van Hoevenberg sent its teams to the 1932 Winter Olympics at Garmisch , but there they had to be content with a second place . That was n't bad , in view of the fact that tile ' weather had clouded the Garmisch run until about the day of the contest , so that our teams had only a day or two to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Run is maintained and operated by the Conservation Department of New York State , which is ready to give a ride to anyone who pays a dollar and signs the waiver . The department drivers have to pass the same test as the racing . drivers  --  ten rides as a passenger from a point not far above the Finish , ten more from a little higher up , and so on ; then the same process at the wheel with an experienced man on the brake . Something like learning to fly . After this winter , Lake Placid wo n't be the only first-class run in the country . Another is being constructed in the White Mountains and others are planned in the Rockies and the Pacific Coast states . Winter sports have come to stay in the United States , and none of them  --  not even ski jumping  --  carries more thrills than bobsledding . So you 'll hear more about it from now on . / 'm all for it  --  with one proviso . That good-luck fairy who takes care of Lake Placid will have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other runs .
