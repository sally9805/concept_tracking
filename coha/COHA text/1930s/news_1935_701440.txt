txt " I forget who it was , " writes SOMERSET MAUGHAM , " that recommended " men for their souls ' good to do each " day two things they disliked : it was " a wise man , and it is a precept that " I have followed scrupulously ; for " every day I have got up and I have " gone to bed . " Although going to bed requires decision and is therefore unnatural , it is not a heroic act like getting up . The day includes twenty-four hours with noon tossed in as a halfway mark between mere sloth and absolute abandon , but none of the hours is late enough to make getting up easy . Although thousands  --  perhaps millions ? of people get up promptly every morning without complaint , they are simply creatures of habit or necessity . " Oh , how I hate to get up in the morning , " the old army ballad says . " It 's nice to get up in the morning , " HARRY LAUDER used to sing , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It certainly is . Getting up can not compare with lying in bed . It is observable that small children , who have had very little experience with life , can get up early , yawn once or twice and then plunge cheerfully into the before-breakfast run . Long before their parents have made the immortal decision of the day the children are screaming around the house . Dogs , also , get up quickly , appear to be fully awake and have no regrets , possibly because they know very well that they will nap on the porch or under the currant bush frequently all day . But grown folk with mature minds who know that getting up is only a prelude to going to work are frequently attacked by dizzy spells when they first open their eyes . The day looks positively dangerous . " I eats well and I sleeps well , " the old salt told his captain , " but when I come to a spot of work I comes all over a-shiver . " There is one illogical aspect about this morbid subject . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the morning looks glorious , for morning is by all odds the best part of the day , excepting the afternoon and evening . In the morning the world looks refreshed ; it has not been soiled by careless handling . To be up and about before sunrise is to be exhilarated by the chief event in the grand pageant of the day , for the sun comes up , blazing and brisk , as though it meant business ; and to see the sunrise is to have complete confidence in the day . The day always starts right . If men could only let it alone it would march straight down the hours without making a single false step , for the sun is incapable of error . What keeps thousands of people from realizing it is the daily crisis of getting up . It shatters a man at the time of day when he is least able to summon his strongest resistance . Of course , the degree of pain varies with the individual . With some people it is only an unhappy little squirming and stretching before they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so excessive that they wear themselves out trying to overcome it . After a man has , over a period of two hours , made several sincere and courageous attempts to get up and failed , the better part of prudence would be to remain in bed . He is in no fit condition to meet the rigors of the day . If that sort of thing happens for several days in succession , getting up is suicidal . By the time he is 80 or 90 years old a man in that critical condition is played out .
