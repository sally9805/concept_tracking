SNOWDEN , Briand and Stresemann were the " Big Three " at the first Hague Reparations Conference , with SNOWDEN towering in the news because of his unexpected , stubborn demand for a bigger slice of " reparations spongecake " ( TIME , Aug. 12 et seq . ) . <P> But last week , when the second Hague Conference met , the new " Big Three " were seen to be CURTIUS , TARDIEU and SNOWDEN , with the courageous , crippled and allegedly crapulous* little Yorkshireman totally missing from headlines because , having bitten off $9,520,000 worth of " spongecake. " he has sensibly shut his mouth on it . <P> Eyes , cameras , typewriters and a roaring battery of telegraph machines were busy with new issues , new men . For them hospitable Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands had carpenters knock together a huge round table in what is ordinarily the lower house of the Dutch Parliament . A little hasty , a little crude were these arrangements , for the lower house had just risen a few days before . But a big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little lumpy . Eyeing each other shrewdly sat the two young statesmen , newly great , between whom the chief issues of last week lay : Dr. Julius Curtius , successor to the late great Dr. Gustav Stresemann as Foreign Minister of the German Republic ; and M. Andr Pierre Gabriel Amede Tardieu , famed as " L'Americain , " successor to M. Aristide Briand as Prime Minister of the French Republic. + <P> Curtius is 52 , Tardieu is 53 . In the way of Democracy v. Autocracy jaunty Captain Tardieu of the 44th Alpine Chasseurs , was wounded and received the Legion d'Honneur 's red rosette " for extraordinary courage . " <P> Meanwhile , as commander of a German battery , Dr. Curtius rushed his guns forward at a crucial moment in the Battle of Verdun , demolished an important French fort , was promoted to the staff of the then Commander-in-Chief of the German Offensive , Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm , and received from the Imperial hand itself the Iron Cross . Quiet Dr. Curtius , who looks even more like a U. S. businessman than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Foreign Minister of the German Republic . <P> Issue of Sanctions . The first thing that Curtius and Tardieu did at The Hague-once the conference had been formally opened by Prime Minister Henri Jaspar of Belgium-was to get together for a long secret conference at the Hotel des Indes where they were rumored to have exchanged high words . <P> Both were agreed on the general principle that the great powers must now ratify once and for all the Owen D. Young Plan , which fixes for the first time the total which Germany owes in reparations and lays down the complete scale of payments for 58 years . So far so good . But deputies of the French Parliament have been asking M. Tardieu : " What guarantee has France that Germany will make these payments ? What punishment awaits Germany if she decides not to pay ? " <P> The Young Plan , a purely business document , does not provide for inflicting punishment-or , in the suave language of diplomacy , " for the application of sanctions .
