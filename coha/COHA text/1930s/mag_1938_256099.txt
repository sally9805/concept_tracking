In most countries extremist parties , left or right , usually show their greatest gains when times are hard . In evenminded Belgium , however , this trend is often reversed . Last week , a time of international if not national stress , the Belgian electorate voted overwhelmingly for the moderate parties in the municipal elections held every six years . Heaviest winners were the Socialist and Catholic Parties , supporters of Premier Paul Henri Spaak . Even the pro-French Liberal Party , thought to be losing its hold , showed wide gains . Heaviest losers were the Communists , Rexists and Flemish Nationalists . The pro-Fascist Rexists blamed their losses on the fact that their Fhrer , dynamic Lon Degrelle , suffering from congestion of the lungs , failed to orate.
