THE GOOD HOPE-Henry Sydnor Harrison-Houghton Mifflin ( $2 ) . <P> This posthumous story by the late Henry Sydnor Harrison is more of a sermon than a novelet , may possibly help lift you to a state of grace if you are still bemoaning stockmarket losses . Author Harrison wrote so cheerfully you may like it anyway . <P> Typical young Bank Clerk Lawrence Renney thought he was conservative , for months kept himself from climbing aboard the late great bandwagon boom in stocks . But when he succumbed at last , everything went his way . Starting with $42,000 , his paper wealth amounted to $500,000 when the crash came and cleaned him out . By then he was living expensively , bibulously , had long been fired from his bank . The morning after one last desperate party he decided to kill himself , went up to the penthouse to step over the edge . But there a girl was waiting for him . She persuaded him to go for a walk , and told him about her own troubles , which were worse than his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in a sanatorium for drug-addicts ; her brother had gambled the remaining family fortune away and died of a broken heart ; her mother had gone blind , died a few months ago . The girl looked peaked herself . <P> During this autobiographical walk around Manhattan one ex-friend after another met Lawrence and offered him friendly help . To cap all , the girl showed him a flourishing bookshop , offered him the job of running it . Then they were mysteriously separated and Lawrence woke up in his room . When he called her apartment he found she had died the day before ; but everything else had really happened . <P> The Author . Death , as it must even to optimists , came to Henry Sydnor Harrison , aged 50 , last July . No widow but many a friend , many a reader , mourned him . Other books : Queed , V. V. 'S Eyes , Angela 's Business .
