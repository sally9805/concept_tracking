txt A PERPETUAL MEMORIAL . Legion Will Pay Weekly Tributes to Unknown Soldier . At Saratoga Springs this week ? Sept. 4 to 6  --  the New York State Convention of the American Legion will be held . One of the outstanding reports will be the one advising the Legionaires and all American citizens that the resolution adopted last year at Utica and brought before the national convention at Louisville last October was unanimously adopted . The special tributca and pilgrimages to the tomb of the Unknown Soldier will henceforth be a national custom . Each of the fifty-two departments of the American Legion ? the forty-eight States and the four colonial possessions from which we drew troops during the World War ? will have one week of the year , thereby assuring a perpetual memorial during the entire year from some part of these United States . New York 's first official pilgrimage since the adoption of this national custom will be held on Sept. 28 , under the chairmanship of Colonel Edward A. Simmons , assisted by six vice chairmen from up the State and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worker . This custom will , no doubt , be a memorial to our World War dead , similar to Memorial Day , handed down to us as a memorial to our Civil War dead . It insures a proper and fitting ceremony and memorial as can only be rendered by the buddies who might have marched along with our national hero . Furthermore , the generations to come should be made to realize the sacrifices made by this generation for a lasting peace we are all hoping to realize . MARY FRANCES HALL . New York , ? Sept. 1 , 1930.
