( See front cover ) The compass point of all Europe last week was a huge square brick and stucco manor house in East Prussia atop which perched pensively a knobby-kneed stork called " Oscar . " <P> Old servants say that Oscar must be nearly as old as the President 's son , spruce Lieut. - Colonel Oscar von Hindenburg . With his nameless mate Oscar spends his winters in Africa , as do most East Prussian storks , but summer finds him always back at Neudeck to bring not babies but good luck to the 86-year-old Reichsprsident . In backward , superstitious East Prussia nothing is so unlucky for a great landed Junker as to lose his stork . " Take care of Oscar " the President benignly commands when leaving Neudeck , and Oscar , so peasants think , takes care of Old Paul . Last week Oscar , dozing on the President 's roof with one leg tucked under his wing , straightened up with a jerk and a squawk as a roaring Mercedes sped up the long white road and out jumped Adolf Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bath had been reached ( TIME , July 9 ) . Either the pudgy , smudge-mustached Chancellor would kick out of his Cabinet such experienced non-Nazi statesmen as Vice Chancellor von Papen and Foreign Minister Baron von Neurath. after which he would go the whole Nazi hog alone , or else these " Balance Wheels " would be retained to steady his careening Government . In Berlin for some days von Papen had been considered politically dead . The strain of living under house arrest , never knowing when his guards might turn executioners , had made the Vice Chancellor 's eyes red from sleepless worry-or nervous weeping . Even a son of onetime All Highest Kaiser Wilhelm , gape-jawed , goggle-eyed Prince August Wilhelm ( " Auwi " ) , had been called on the carpet as a plot suspect by bull-necked Nazi General Hermann Wilhelm Gring . After grilling perspiring " Auwi , " whom he scared half to death , General Gring kicked him out of the Nazi Party and out of the Storm Troops in which he had been a group commander with the stinging words : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be bad . Get out ! " <P> By no means stupid , Col. von Papen begged his guards to take him down to the Chancellory . There the Vice Chancellor sent up his card , " I wish to see the Chancellor . " <P> Adolf Hitler , who was sitting with Nazi members of the Cabinet around his modernistic Round Table with a hole in the middle , professed surprise and sent down a question , " Why does the Vice Chancellor not come up and take his seat ? " <P> Instead red-eyed von Papen begged a word with Herr Hitler away from his Nazis . When this was granted he offered his resignation , protesting , " My service to the Fatherland is over ! " As von Papen drove away , still guarded , official Berlin considered him an ex-Vice Chancellor and workmen began ripping down partitions in his offices . In moved the new Chief of Staff of the blood-purified Storm Troops , leather-lunged Viktor Lutze.                    @
