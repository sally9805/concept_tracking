txt A half billion dollar addition to the bill for national defense , possibly financed by a special new tax , was forecast at a Presidential press conference yesterday . President Roosevelt asserted such a tax , coupled with a reduction of the government 's budget for the year starting next July 1 and continuation of an upward trend in federal revenue . might be instrumental in halving the deficit . Undoubtedly , he declared , more money must be spent for defenses because of the present world situation . He said this year 's sum would have to be increased by about $500,000,000 , and that the new total would be less than $2,300 , - 000.000 , but in excess of $2,000,000,000 . A thing the country ought to understand and think about , he said , is this : If the money were borrowed , additional taxes would be unnecessary ; a pay-as-you-go basis would require some form of new national defense taxes . While Mr. Roosevelt saw a chance of making what he called a very substantial reduction in the deficit . he replied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the budget could be balanced . if defense expenditures were not taken into consideration .
