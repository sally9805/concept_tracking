( See front cover ) In Vatican City a little more than two years ago , the hale Holy Father of the world 's 331,500,000 Roman Catholics briskly bestowed his approval upon a decision tentatively made by the Permanent Committee of the Perpetual International Eucharistic Congress . Since 1881 , under the guidance of this Committee , 32 great gatherings of Catholics had been held , as religious demonstrations against secularization , in such great cities as London , Chicago , Sydney , Buenos Aires , in such holy places as Lourdes and Jerusalem . The 33rd Eucharistic Congress , agreed the Committee and Pope Pius XI , would go to Manila in the Philippines , " Pearl of the Orient " not only to travel agents but , in the most spiritual sense , to the Church which shepherds 82% of its 18,000,000 souls , proudly claims them as the only Christian nation of the East . <P> Last month as preparations for the Manila Congress went forward , Pius XI lay racked with pain , dying some thought , in his third-floor chamber in the Vatican @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not be put off , an old friend and trusted servant from across the Atlantic : Dennis Joseph Cardinal Dougherty , 71 , Archbishop of the See of Philadelphia ( 824,250 Catholics ) , Metropolitan of the Province of Philadelphia ( 2,080,788 souls in six Sees ) , Titular Priest of Rome 's Church of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo , member of the Congregations of the Sacraments , of Sacred Rites , for the Oriental Church , for the Propagation of Faith . Upon bull-framed , square-jawed Cardinal Dougherty , as vigorous a man physically as the Holy Father now was frail , Pius XI had chosen to bestow a high honor , sending him as Legate a latere-spiritually and literally " from the Pope 's side " - to the Congress in Manila . Emerging from the Vatican after a half-hour visit , loyally declaring that the Pope looked " well , bright and cheerful , " Cardinal Dougherty said the Holy Father 's message to his children in Manila was : " Pray for the re- establishment of peace in a world which needs it badly . " <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the person of the Pope , Legate Dougherty assembled a retinue in Rome and with bands blaring embarked at Naples on the S. S. Conte Rosso , flying the yellow- &-white; Papal flag and carrying twelve altars for the devotions of its passenger list . <P> Eastward the Cardinal 's passage was almost regal . He inspected II Duce 's colonial Massaua , dedicated a new. - cathedral at Port Said , unflinchingly visited lepers in Colombo , enjoyed receptions in Bombay and Singapore . But always during the 22 days the Conte Rosso sped eastward the ship 's wireless brought disturbing word of the Holy Father 's health . Fifteen years ago storms at sea kept Dennis Cardinal ' Dougherty from taking part in the conclave which elected Pope Pius XI after the death of Benedict XV . Last month , honored though he was as the first U. S. Prince of the Church ever sent as Legate to an international Catholic gathering , Cardinal Dougherty stood ready to disembark at any port , fly back to Rome , delegating his Legate 's powers as he had made sure he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pope lived on .
