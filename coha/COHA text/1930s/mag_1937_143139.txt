Few first-rate football coaches stay in one place long enough to become an institution . Even fewer paint desert scenes in the Southwest . Robert Carl Zuppke of the University of Illinois does not claim to be a great painter though critics filled their reviews of his one-man show of landscapes last spring in Chicago 's Palmer House with awed quotations from his rugged views on Art ( " Art and football are very much alike " ) . More important to Robert Zuppke and a majority of the inhabitants of central Illinois is the fact that in the last 24 years Illinois teams have won twice as many football games as they have lost . <P> Seven Zuppke teams have topped the Big Ten . Two were undefeated and untied . But since 1930 there has been no star like Harold ( " Red " ) Grange playing for Coach Zuppke and Illinois teams have been far from spectacular . Many an Illinois alumnus has lately grumbled that in football there is no place for sentiment . But that Illinois ' attachment for Robert Zuppke was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Illinois played Notre Dame for the first time since 1898 . <P> Last week Robert Zuppke 's finger-on which he superstitiously changes rings if his team loses-twitched . A highly touted Notre Dame team which Coach Elmer Layden thought was the best he had yet assembled , scored twice as many first downs as Illinois , and twice as many yards from scrimmage . But at the end of the game Zuppke 's rings were still in order . Zuppke 's 25th anniversary year had begun with a small triumph . Score : 0-to-0 . <P> Most annoying play in football is when a winning touchdown is canceled by a penalty . Tennessee 's Wood last week threw a pass to Duncan for a touchdown against Duke in the first quarter , but someone was offside . Therefore when the final whistle blew , Coach Wallace Wade had succeeded in preserving unblemished his record of never having a team defeated on Duke 's " Homecoming Day . " Score : 0-to-0 . <P> For two years the football activities of Yale 's Clinton Frank were dimmed by the presence of Yale @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field . Against Pennsylvania last week Frank scored one touchdown , passed to Al Wilson for another , played a brilliant defense , helped a creaking Yale machine defeat Pennsylvania for the fourth year in a row . Score : 27-to-7 . <P> Northwestern won last year 's Big Ten title mostly by hard running . Last week Michigan , which once won Big Ten titles with embarrassing regularity , stopped Northwestern 's runners but was unable to keep Don Heap from passing to Cleo Diehl for one touchdown . Score : 7-to-0 . <P> Columbia and Army scored three touchdowns apiece . In such a situation to miss one kick for extra point may mean defeat . Columbia missed three . Only satisfaction for Columbia was possession of the country 's Player-of-the-Week , Sid Luckman , who completed 18 passes , two for touchdowns , ran back a kickoff for a third . Score : 21-to-18 . <P> Ohio State 's chances for an undefeated season seemed very good fortnight ago after victories over Texas Christian and Purdue . But all hope was blasted last week because they missed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Ohio State scored two touchdowns , but Southern California got one conversion and Ohio State got none . Score : 13-to-12.
