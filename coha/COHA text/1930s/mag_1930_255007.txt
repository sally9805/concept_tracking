In a dingy courtroom stinking of vermifuge , at Mays Landing , N. J. , last week , two petty criminals stood before the bar of justice . The man was convicted of bookmaking ( horse-race betting ) , sentenced to a year in prison , fined $1,000 . The woman was found guilty of running a disorderly house , given three years imprisonment , also fined $1,000 . The cases of the gambler and the procuress did not excite Atlantic County interest as examples of routine viciousness , but as the first definite results of an unusually elaborate crusade conducted by a newspaper . <P> Seldom does even the most sensational journal concern itself with corruption outside its own city . But the Hearst-owned New York Evening Journal had seen fit to start a campaign last month to clean up the politics of gaudy Atlantic City , 123 mi. away . Its action was explained by the fact that the resort , a happy hunting ground for shillabers and sharpsters , is frequently visited by the Journal 's clientele . <P> Since the first of January , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day crammed with news characteristically bold-stroked , free-swinging and Hearstian . As a result of its findings , the sober element of Atlantic citizenry have banded together , led by the Chamber of Commerce , to run Mayor Anthony M. Ruffu Jr . and his henchmen out of town . <P> The convictions at Mays Landing last week were part of a general house-cleaning anticipated by long-suffering townsmen . The procuress , Kitty Harris , operated her lupanar at No. 2128 Arctic Ave. , Atlantic City . Shrewd Journal reporters alleged that she had not only enjoyed official patronage , but was the Mayor 's tenant . The bookmaker , Louis O'Donnell , had the distinction of being the first member of his profession to be sent to prison by the rusty wheels of Atlantic County justice in 33 years . <P> Of the nefarious activities of Mayor Ruffu and his banditti , the Journal has reported : <P> " Mayor Ruffu , in addition to his manifold duties in selling insurance to the city and renting disorderly houses . . . using his office as chief magistrate of Atlantic City @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend 's pocket . . . finds time to supervise 26 bureaus . <P> " Virtually every one of these public activities of Mayor Ruffu has called down criticism . . . . <P> " One of the busiest of the ' magistrates ' is Frank Waldmayer , who is commonly addressed and referred to by the assumed title of ' Chief City Magistrate . ' . . . <P> " One of the outstanding things for which Chief Magistrate Waldmayer is beloved is the bar in the cellar of his home . . . . <P> " A confrre , Magistrate Herman Satinovera , told Evening Journal reporters : ' Magistrate Waldmayer is the only man in town who serves better liquor than Nocky Johnson at the Ritz . His bar is wonderful . . . . ' " <P> One alleged business venture of Magistrate Waldmayer 's is the publication of a handbook , thickly padded with complimentary advertising . " Some of the advertisers are known as bootleggers , white slavers , gamblers and confidence men . " <P> The Journal , in probing corrupt minutia in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an experienced police officer three days to put together a distribution chart of the force . . . no proper records are kept . . . crime prevention and arrests are kept secret . . . .
