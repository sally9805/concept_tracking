Up from their coastal bases on the Italian peninsula last week rose the dripping hulls of 80 Savoia-Marchetti seaplane bombers . Their glossy-headed young pilots turned them north , over Ostmark , over Bohemia-Moravia , over German Poland and East Prussia and up the Baltic to the besieged shores of Finland . <P> Officially they never started , never got there-just as the Italian planes and legions were not in Spain for a year or more . <P> Officially they did not cross Germany , on their way to bomb the Latvian air bases of Germany 's pledged partner Russia . But if the Savoia-Marchettis did not cross German territory , then they arrived in Finland through some fourth dimension , for the British Intelligence Service pointed out that they did not take and were not given permission to take the roundabout route across the German-Allied western battle zone . <P> All in all , it was a mass flight of first historic importance . Not because of its distance ( over 1,000 miles ) . Not because it brought invaluable and much needed help to the Finns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short on seaplanes . But because it cast the brightest landing light to date on the tangled surface of the Russian-German agreements , did much to illuminate the contemplated future policies of both those countries , and foreshadowed a major alteration in the course of World War II . <P> Obscured on one hand by the world 's moral indignation at the Finnish invasion , on the other by Russia 's childish duplicity in announcing its reasons for starting the war , is one plain strategic fact . The Baltic States , including Finland , are primarily buffers between the two big Baltic powers : Germany and Russia . Buffers can also be jump-off points for invasion , and in invading Finland , Joseph Stalin was clearly protecting himself against the friend he has never met , Adolf Hitler . At the same time , no matter what are her other commitments with Russia , Germany can not look with equanimity on any move which upsets the buffers and the balance in the Baltic . <P> That the chancelleries of Europe had these facts straight , and that the outbreak of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choosing-up of sides in World War II , was evident in many places last week : <P> &gt; In Moscow , Tass , official Soviet news agency , not only reported ( from Scandinavian sources ) the arrival of the Italian planes in Finland , but stated that they had even landed to refuel in their flight across Germany . Furthermore , said Tass , it had heard that Germany herself was forwarding planes , munitions and even gasoline to Finland . To this Germany issued a cagey denial . <P> &gt;Also in Moscow . German diplomats made the most of the evident German double cross on Russia ( in partial payment for Russia 's double cross in taking control of Estonia , Latvia , Lithuania ) . They suggested to neutral diplomats that now was a very good time for the Allies to make peace with Germany-i.e. , before Communism spread further .
