" When a biological entity like the wild duck is the innocent bystander in the great American game of politics , it 's no joke ! " <P> Thus snorted handsome , Harvard-bred John H. Baker , the banker-trained executive-director of the National Association of Audubon Societies when , last fortnight , the U. S. Biological Survey announced through President Roosevelt that this year , like last , there will be a 30-day open season for duckshooting . Using the Drought as his prime argument , Director Baker had been trying to have duckshooting suspended entirely until the birds can breed up to their oldtime numbers . Using reports from its field agents as evidence , the Survey had concluded that while U. S. breeding areas were affected , Drought had not touched the ducks in their vast northern Canadian nesting grounds this year . It would therefore be safe for U. S. wild-fowlers to shoot into this year 's migration under rigid restrictions similar to those imposed last year . Again there may be no baiting , no live decoys , no sink boxes or batteries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three shells . But there will still be duckshooting . <P> Sportsmen across the middle of the U. S. complained last year that their season ( Oct. 21 through Nov. 19 ) was too early . This year the Survey took heed and divided the U. S. into three zones instead of two , setting dates as follows : Northern ( Maine , New Hampshire , Vermont , Michigan , Wisconsin , Minnesota , the Dakotas , Montana ) : Oct. 10 through Nov. 8 . <P> Intermediate ( Arizona , California , Colorado , Connecticut , Illinois , Idaho , Indiana , Iowa , Kansas , Massachusetts , Missouri , Nebraska , Nevada , New Mexico , New York , Ohio , Oregon , Pennsylvania . Rhode Island , Utah , Washington , West Virginia , Wyoming ) : Nov. i through Nov. 30 . <P> Southern ( Alabama , Arkansas , Delaware , Florida , Georgia . Kentucky , Louisiana , Maryland . Mississippi , New Jersey . North Carolina , Oklahoma , South Carolina , Tennessee , Texas , Virginia ) : Nov. 26 through Christmas Day . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not calculated to win the Roosevelt Administration votes on the Atlantic seaboard . To the list of protected birds it added Atlantic brant , canvasback and redhead ducks . Daily bag limits for 1936 remain as in 1935 - ten ducks of all species and four geese or brant - with only one day 's bag allowed in possession at any time . <P> U. S. gunners were gratified to learn that this year Canadian gunners , though allowed two months to shoot the birds which breed in their country , are limited to a daily bag of twelve ducks , five geese or brant .
