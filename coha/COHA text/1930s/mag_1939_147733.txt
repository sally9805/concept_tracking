Nazi Germany probably is more confused today than it has been since the days in 1933 when the Hitler Government first came to power . . . . Submarine crews in Hamburg have been refusing to leave on trips unless they are released from the necessity of coming to the surface before torpedoing belligerent commercial vessels . . . . For some time certain persons have been firmly convinced that Germany intended to invade The Netherlands . . . It was learned today that the conservative Army high command flatly refused to countenance any such action . . . . <P> So ran a dispatch on the front page of the New York Herald Tribune one day last week . Had it been datelined London or Paris , most propaganda-wise readers would have passed it by with an indulgent smile . But it was datelined Berlin , signed by 27-year-old Seymour Beach Conger , newly appointed chief of the Herald Tribune 's Berlin bureau . It . had slipped easily through German censorship , which concentrates on suppressing " undesirable " writers , not undesirable words . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for their regular morning conference , there was hell to pay . Blond , youthful Dr. Karl Bomer , head of the press department , grimly read passages from Newsman Conger 's dispatch , exclaiming : " Lies ! . . . Scoundrelly reporting ! ... False to the last syllable ! " Added another propaganda official : " It 's worse than a lost battle ! " <P> Deprived of his right to attend press meetings or send dispatches , because of this " violation of the hospitality of the Reich , " Newsman Conger was effectively silenced . Stern Dr. Bomer offered to restore his privileges if the Herald Tribune would print a retraction . But it was unthinkable that the Herald Tribune would take orders from Berlin , repudiate what its own correspondent had written . Said Managing Editor Grafton Wilcox in Manhattan : " If there is an official German denial , we 'll print that . " There was no German denial . <P> Thus ended , six weeks after it began , Beach Conger 's brief career as a Berlin bureau chief . Born in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : the late Seymour Beach Conger Sr. spent 13 years in Russia and Germany for Associated Press , was attached to the German Army during World War I. Young Conger was graduated from the University of Michigan in 1932 , went twice around the world , then joined the Herald Tribune staff two years ago . <P> When Joseph Barnes gave up his job in Berlin and went home for a rest ( weary of constant Nazi threats to muzzle him ) , Herald Tribune editors debated long over Beach Conger 's youth and inexperience , finally gave him Barnes 's place . Blond , meticulous , with close-cropped hair and thick-lensed spectacles , Conger looks like a respectable German official . Within two hours after his arrival in Berlin he had telephoned more people than Joseph Barnes knew . Most of them were young Nazis who had once been his schoolmates.
