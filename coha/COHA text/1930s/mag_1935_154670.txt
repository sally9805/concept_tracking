Subject of the leading article in last week 's American Medical Association Journal was acne vulgaris-the blackheads and pimples of adolescence . Dr. Jeffrey Charles Michael , Houston acne specialist who wrote the article , included the address he made as chairman of the skin specialists attending the American Medical Association convention in Atlantic City last June . Here was a disease that has marred to some extent the face , back and chest of every other human being who ever grew up to manhood . It has gouged ugly pits in multitudes of skins . Doctors have dealt with it for 3,200 years of recorded medical history . Yet Dr. Michael , in his two cardinal discussions of acne vulgaris , was obliged to state : " The pathogenesis of the disorder is still lacking . . . . The therapeutic problem is not yet satisfactorily solved . " Doctors , in plain words , do not know the cause of acne , nor its cure . <P> They do know that pores of the face , chest and back , through which sebum oozes to oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thus suppressed , pushes outward , forms a blackhead or a pimple . <P> Doctors do know that the condition appears with puberty , usually vanishes at maturity , but may persist , particularly in women . Therefore doctors think that acne is tied up in some way with sex . <P> Acne also seems to be associated with sagging viscera , sluggish bowels , and intestinal toxemia . There is an acne bacillus . But it probably merely thrives on the disease , does not cause it . <P> Best treatment for acne which Dr. Michael knows of , after dealing with the disease for 25 years , is to spray the pimpled skin with x-rays . Treatment must go on for several years . Relapses frequently occur . <P> However , Dr. Michael no longer uses x-rays on boys and girls under 18 . He has them watch their diet and bowels , wash their faces well , on the expectation that most of them will outgrow their acne naturally . On acne patients between 18 and 22 years of age , he uses x-rays . In older @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diseases . If he finds and cures such conditions , the acne usually disappears . If not , he resorts to x-rays ; and with women , if nothing else works , to female sex hormones.
