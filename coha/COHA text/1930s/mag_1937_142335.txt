If Franklin . Roosevelt has the smartest political brain in the U. S. , there is no doubt Manuel Quezon has the smartest political brain in the Philippines . Last week Seor Quezon 's brain was visiting the U. S. , working full speed while its owner was busy in Washington with the Interdepartmental Committee on Philippine affairs . For Mr. Quezon was putting a very delicate case to Assistant Secretary of State Francis B. Sayre , Admiral William D. Leahy , Chief of Naval Operations , Brigadier General Creed F. Cox , Chief of the Bureau of Insular Affairs , Paul V. <P> McNutt , U. S. High Commissioner to the Philippines , and their advisers . <P> Seor Quezon 's case , put bluntly , was that the Philippines were promised their freedom ( after ten years of local self-government ) as a result of mixed motives , which in turn had brought about an intolerable economic situation . The Independence Act was supported in Congress by two groups , one inspired by international altruism , the other inspired by national selfishness . Those inspired by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to put the Philippines outside the U. S. tariff barrier so as to get rid of business competitors . Into the law they wrote provisions which would institute a series of export taxes on Philippine goods shipped to the U. S.-the equivalent of a U. S. tariff-beginning at 5% in 1940 and mounting 5% a year . Since the U. S. is the Philippines ' best market and the Philippines ' chief export , sugar , goes almost entirely to the U. S. , the Independence Act , as Seor Quezon well knows , is the next thing to sure ruin for the economy of the Islands . But independence means to the Philippines much what isolation means to the U. S. So three years ago when independence was offered , it was politically impossible for Seor Quezon to refuse . Now his job as President of the Commonwealth is to fix it so that Filipinos can eat the cake of independence and at the same time keep the cake of free trade with the U. S. <P> Last week it looked as if he might gain his ambiguous end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the Committee in Washington to create a joint committee of experts : 1 ) to study and recommend a program " for the adjustment of the Philippine national recovery , " 2 ) to consider the economic merits of advancing the date of complete Philippine independence from 1946 to 1938 or 1939.
