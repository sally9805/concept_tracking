Franklin Roosevelt was considerably jolted this week when the nine black-robed Justices of the Supreme Court , with unexpected unanimity , declared the Blue Eagle as dead as a slaughtered chicken ( see p. 13 ) . But this great blow to the New Deal 's most enthusiastic experiment was not as personal as the blow which the nine Justices , with equal unanimity , dealt at the authority which he assumed in the days of his White House honeymoon . <P> In 1925 , Calvin Coolidge appointed to the Federal Trade Commission a goat-bearded onetime Congressman from Seattle named William E. Humphrey . He served his six-year term , was reappointed by President Hoover in 1931 for another six years . <P> After Franklin Roosevelt took office , he asked commissioner Humphrey to resign . Mr. Humphrey refused . President Roosevelt thereupon removed him , not for misconduct or inefficiency but simply because " the aims and purposes of the Administration with respect to the work of the Commission can be carried out most effectively with personnel of my own selection . " <P> Last week the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Commission was created as a quasi-judicial body . Said they : " It must be free from executive control . We think the President does not have illimitable power of removal . " <P> Thus Franklin Roosevelt lost and William Humphrey won . The only trouble was that William Humphrey has been dead for 15 months . His estate should eventually get $3,043.06 in back salary which President Roosevelt 's illegal ouster deprived him of . <P> For his White House newshawks the President last week gave a gay dance at which his Daughter Anna and his new ex-newshawk Son-in-Law John Boettiger , his ex-Daughter-in-Law Elizabeth Donner Roosevelt and his Son James were present . <P> Next day , still in the gayest spirits , he drove down to Annapolis followed by a cortege of a dozen cars bearing his numerous family and friends ( including the Morgenthaus , Hopkinses , Tugwells ) , to attend a regatta ( see p. 37 ) . <P> From the Fierce-Arrow plant at Buffalo two swank blue limousines were sent to Washington . Both were rated to do 110 m.p.h. , both fitted throughout @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible protection of bullet-proof steel plate . One was addressed to J. Edgar Hoover , chief bandit hunter of the Department of Justice , the other to Franklin D. Roosevelt .
