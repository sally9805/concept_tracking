txt The Federal employes ' retirement fund is " completely insolvent , " with the national government more than $2,000,000,000 in arrears in its payments to the fund , according to E. Claude Babcock , president of the American Federation of Government Employes . Addressing the third annual convention of the federation yesterday at the Hotel Pennsylvania , Mr. Babcock said : " It is a fact that if every Federal employe resigned today the fund would be insufficient by $200,000 , - 000 to repay what the employes themselves had put into it . The fund is in a condition which no bank or insurance inspector would permit to exist for three minutes in a private business . " He said the last official computation , made in June , 1930 , had shown an accrued Federal liability to the fund of $970,000,000 . Since then , he added , two compulsory retirement provisions had more than doubled those on the retirement rolls . Doubts Annuities Can Be Met . In Mr. Babcock 's opinion the income on the fund this year will not be adequate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared that the " best expert opinion " concurred in his estimate of the government 's $2,000,000,000 liability and estimated that Congress would have to supplement its statutory contribution to the fund of 2.45 per cent of the Federal payroll by an additional appropriation of $100,000,000 annually for sixty-eight years to restore the fund to " solvency . " He admitted that " we have not even a moderate chance to get such a sum , although we should bend every effort to induce Congress to keep its pledges by recognizing its obligation . " As an alternative he suggested reducing the number of prospective annuities to be drawn from the fund by eliminating all compulsory features of the retirement act . He called for the abolition of statutory retirement ages , which now range from 62 to 70 years in various branches ? of the government service , and substitution of a system under which " employes will be retired when they become inefficient and superannuated in point of fact and not simply in point of years . " " No cure for the deficiency is to be found in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " since they are entitled by law to retrieve everything they put in ; and , we can not and will not subscribe to the breach of moral faith involved in reducing the payments to those already on the rolls . " Mayor LaGuardia , welcoming the 250 delegates , revealed that he sometimes wished he were back in the Congressional seat which he occupied for fourteen years before becoming Mayor . He stressed the need for a nationally minded Congress and predicted that the next session would consider " some of the most important problems ever before an American Congress , not even excluding the Civil War period . " " If ever there was a time when the undivided attention of national legislators was required it , is now , " he said . " I say national because I mean those who take a nation-wide rather than a sectional view of matters . " He urged the delegates to " look around our town , " assuring them that " I have been looking around it for the last six months . " Representative William F. Brunner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Roosevelt has shown us the way to recovery , " he declared . " It is fortunate that we have in Washington a man like him with the courage of his convictions . I have agreed with him in everything except the question of Federal pay cuts . " George Preston Marshall , publisher of The Washington Times , accused the Federal Government of inconsistency in its dictates to industry as compared with its . policy toward its own employes . " In the movement to restore the salary of the American working man to a point where he could preserve the American standard of living , government lags far behind private industry , " Mr. Marshall said . Outlining the convention 's work , Mr. Babcock recommended adoption of an amendment to the federation 's constitution extending the $resent ban on strikes by government employes to include picketing and the use of " inordinately " large committees or any other physical show of force .
