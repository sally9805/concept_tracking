Two of C. I. O. 's best mechanics , Vice Chairmen Philip Murray &; Sidney Hillman , last week finished the first of several repair jobs on the United Automobile Workers of America . When President Homer Martin recently lost control of U. A. W. and tried to fix up his machine by throwing out four of its most important cogs-Messrs Richard Frankensteen , Wyndham Mortimer , Ed Hall , George Addes-John L. Lewis sent Mechanics Murray and Hillman to Detroit to interfere . There they persuaded Mr. Martin to let them get up on the driver 's seat , one on each side of him , to watch his driving ( TIME , Sept. 26 ) . Last week , having steered U. A. W. into a garage , in privacy behind closed doors they effected the repair most needed to make it run again : put back the four vital parts Mr. Martin had thrown out . <P> Meantime , U. A. W. 's self-starter began to turn the engine over , putting pressure on motor makers for a 32-hour week to spread-the-work . Result : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' s Plymouth factory in Detroit , and throwing out of work 9,000 Briggs Body Co. workers .
