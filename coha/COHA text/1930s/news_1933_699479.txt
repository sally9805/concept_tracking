" home of one of New York 's best known society women and patron of the arts . At that gathering three different schools of though emerged and three possible solutions of the problem were offered , each with its little group of supporters .

That the Metropolitan Opera Association seek financial support in Chicago as well as New York and divide its season between the two cities . That the Metropolitan Opera Association be scrapped to make way for a small company to be composed exclusively of American singers who would emphasize the work of American composers and librettists . It was understood that the first plan for effecting further economies was the most likely of adoption . In connection with the proposal to divide the Metropolitan between New York and Chicago , which lost its Civic Opera with the collapse of the Insull fortune , it was reported that some slight progress had been made in negotiations . Louis Eckstein , a director of the Metropolitan and the chief backer of Chicago 's open-air opera in Ra.vinia Park . was said to have been in conferepce several times recently with Edward Ziegler , assistant general manger , and Ear/ Lewis , secretary of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The all-American opera scheme was said to be receiving scant attention except from a small group which sponsored the idea originally .

Juilliaid endowed with a fund of $15,000,000 to promote musical appreciation and education , was not disclosed . The will of Mr. Juilliard , who died in 1919 , provided for assistance to the Metropolitan in time of need by giving authority to the executors and trustees : " To aid by gift or part of income at such times and to such extent in such amounts as the trustees of such foundation may in their discretion deem proper the Metropolitan Opera Company in the City of New York for the purpose of assisting such organization in the production of operas , provided that suitable arrangements can be made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wise inure to its monetary benefit . " It has been reported that the Metropolitan asked and obtained a $5,0()0 loan at 6 per cent interest from the Juilliard Fund last Fall when it was contemplating the current season , with Mr. Cravath hoping that a shortened list of productions , reduced salaries and lower prices would enable the company to " break even . " At the close of the last season , as the Metropolitan entered upon the fiftieth year of its glamorous tradition and the twenty-fifth under the successful and thrifty management of Giulio Gatti-Casazza , it first became apparent that the prolonged depression was threatening the continuance of the opera . The $1,000,000 surplus that Gatti had accumulated tor periods of economic stress during the prosperous years which reached their peak in the 1929-1930 season was almost exhausted and it became necessary to set up a $150,000 fund to guarantee this season 's schedule . It is now apparent that more than twice that sum will be needed for another season . The response of the public last Spring was encouraging . Subscriptions totaled more than $500,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many of those who had subscribed for the shortened season ? which reduced the cost of subscription by nearly 50 per cent ? were unable to meet their obligations . Reductions in the price of tickets for separate performances attracted more general public interest , but failed to fill the house , whose capacity had been cut from about $15,000 nightly to $13,000 by price revisions . Members of the administrative and artistic staffs of the opera company have had two cuts In salary . The first- was a genera cut of 10 per cent . This was followed by cuts on a graduated scale reaching as high as 35 per cent for those receiving the highest salaries . The time when soloists could command $2,000 for a single performance has vanished , it was said yesterday , and the prediction was made that if the opera continues next season on a shortened schedule no prima donna may expect more than $500 for a performance .
