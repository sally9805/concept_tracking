txt Radio Alow and Aloft . To the Editor or The Kew York Times ? I sympathize deeply with " Times Reader , " who complains of the outrageous overhead bellowing of an advertising loud-speaker in an airplane . I do not see why this is permitted , but my own reaction is to refuse to buy anything advertised in this way . If we all unite in this attitude the advertiser will learn that public ill will does not pay . As for the radio loud-speakers , they make life miserable for us all . Many of the things I am compelled to listen to against my will seem to me so stupid . so trivial and so badly done that I can not imagine their giving pleasure to any one of even subnormal mind . The yawps and bellows of other people 's radios are leading me toward a boycott of goods so advertised . Tortured nerves may become a strong factor in building up sales resistance . PESSIMIST ..
