txt A determined Senatorial effort to create a balanced budget got under way today with the appointment of a strictly bipartisan Economy Committee of six members , who will meet tomorrow for the first time . In the meantime the Appropriations Committee will defer consideration of all pending supply bills . The economy group , which is a subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee , was appointed by Chairman Jones , who will serve as its chairman also . Senators Bingham and Dickinson - were the other Republirns appointed on it . Senators , Bretton and Byrnes are the Democrats . The White House is gratified by the prompt Senatorial action , and President Hoover is said to be hopeful that " a real economy program " may be produced in the Senate , in contrast with the House fiasco that resulted in an " economy " bill whose savings totaled only $30,000,000 , compared with hoped-for results of more than $200,000,000 . Mr. Jones said tonight that the White House had been asked by telephone if the President had any suggestions or amendments to the House economy bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some suggestions ready tomorrow , he was told . Secretary Mills was in conference with the President more than three hours this afternoon , discussing economy . The President is said to be hopeful that the new cooperative action by the White House and the Senate may yield savings of at least $300 , - 000,000 , in addition to $360,000,000 pared from budget estimates for the fiscal year 1933 . Senator Jones reflected thi ' 9 same hope , as did other members of the new Economy Committee . Shouse Attacks Hoover Action . " We shall cut every place that it is possible to cut , " Mr. Jones said . " The Senate economy bill may include additional savings of $200,000 , - 000 ; it may include savings of $300 , - 000,000 . We shall do everything possible to aid governmental economy . " It is practically taken for granted in Senatorial circles that the combined action of the Senate and the White House will be sufficient to force a majority of House members to accede to recommended savings , particularly as the economies undoubtedly will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own Economy Committee . There was a manifestation of complete harmony today in the fight for governmental economy except for a statement by Jouett Shouse , chairman of the Democratic National Executive Committee . He criticized Mr. Hoover for inviting only Republicans to his two week-end economy conferences and said the President had permitted department heaps and " his own secretary to lobby at the Capitol against the reductions the House Ways and Means Committee wished to put into effect . " The Appropriations Committee sped the new Economy Committee on its way this afternoon in a burst of harmonious agreement ; this morning it had conferred authority on Chairman Jones to appoint the subcommittee that henceforth will be the Economy Committee . In its being so constituted that neither political party has a majority , the subcommittee is noteworthy ; its formation and nature followed a suggestion made yesterday on the floor by Senator Robinson of Arkansas , Democratic leader . When the Appropriations Committee met this afternoon it voted unanimously to delay action on five pend- ing appropriation bills and numerous resolutions affecting these bills ; this action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measures were being cut 10 per cent . The Economy Committee invited Chairman of the House Economy Committee and Representative Ramseyer , a member , to sit with it tomorrow . Yesterday they had offered their services . The White House was equally active , although no details were made public about what happened in the President 's office . Secretary Mills called at 3 P. M. From 3 to 4:30 P. M. Acting Secretary Castle of the State Department and Secretary Hurley were with the President and Mr. Mills . Mr. Mills left the President 's office at 6:30 P. M. He said , in response to questions by newspaper men , that economy had been the principal topic discussed . Also present during Mr. Mills 's conversation with the President were Budget Director Roop and Walter Newton , one of the President 's secretaries . Robert L. O'Brien , chairman of the Tariff Commission , called at the White House this afternoon , but did not talk with Mr. Hoover . Hoover Encouraged by Action . The conferences last week-end at the White House developed , in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of party leaders in the Senate , and the White House is optimistic that rapid progress will be made in the passage of a revenue bill that will meet the budget requirements of the government as well as eliminating objectionable features of the House bill . Information coming to the White House is that a distinct feeling of encouragement is noticeable throughout the country as a result of the improved situation in the Senate . There are signs , it was said on behalf of the President , of returning confidence in quarters where all was pessimism a short time ago. ? It Is expected at the White House that the formation of the Senate Economy Committee will bring about the reintroduction of special legislation necessary to economies which must be forthcoming if the budget is to be balanced . The President , it was pointed out , can not effect these economies without special legislation . Finally , too , there is White House gratification at the definite lifting of the $2,400,000,000 bonus menace . In the opinion of the White House nothing has occurred which will do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " which has been evidenced in the country since March 10 , when the proposals submitted by the Ways and Means Committee began to break down , than the " death and burial " of the bonus . The administration is convinced that the country is already taking courage from the evidence that the Senate plans to take up the program of a balanced budget and economy and go forward with it . The Statement by Shouse . Mr. Shouse , in his statement issued through the Democratic National Committee , said that " few people will take issue with President Hoover in his arraignment of Congress for is delay . in enacting -a - ooroprehen-  , sive and adequate tax bill , and in putting through an economy measure that will really result in decreasing the expenditures of the Federal Government to the extent required by our present emergency . " " On the other hand , " he added , " Mr. Hoover stultifies himself by appealing for non-partisan action on the great fiscal measures while at the same time he is holding Congressional conferences in regard to them and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ designated Democratic leaders of the Senate and House . " The present emergency lies mainly at the President 's own door-step . He has had two and a half years since the inevitable decrease in government revenues was foreshadowed and during all of that time he not only refrained himself from any move to reduce the expenditures of the various departments but has permitted the heads of those departments and his own secretary to lobby at the Capitol against the reductions of the House Ways and Means Committee wished to put into effect . " This statement is made on the authority of Chairman Joseph W. Byrns of the House Appropriations Committee . " Mr. Shouse conceded that " Congress has been influenced by minority groups on the ground of political expediency to whittle away much of the economy program , " but declared that " the President himself , through his Cabinet officers , has his full share of blame for the confusion . " " The bills directed to the adjustment of the Federal finances  --  that is , to wipe out the deficit which resulted from the inept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fair progress of advancement , " Mr. Shouse said . " The House of Representatives is practically through with its part of the procedure , and whatever blocking of the program is visible is in the Republican Senate . Oddie 's Fight Against Art Cited . " Yesterday , for example , Mr. Oddie of Nevada , one of the stanchest of the administration Senators and one of those who participated in the partisan White House conferences , attempted to throw a monkey wrench into the machinery with a resolution I to rescind the Senate 's recent action 's in ordering a 10 per cent cut in the appropriations in the Treasury-Postoffice bill . " It is historically correct to state that never in peacetime legislation has there been such extensive cooperation , such a truce of partisanship . as has accompanied the efforts of the present Congress to balance the budget . It is true that on several occasions the leaders of both parties have found it impossible to bring their followers into line , but that fact hardly offers an excuse for the President of the United States to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utmost to get the best out of the material with which they must work . * * * " A question must occur to everybody as to the President 's title to assail Congress for indecision and dilatoriness when he himself has been the conspicuous offender in both regards for so long a time . " The appropriation bills which are being held up by the Senate Appropriations Committee pending the evolving of an economy bill are the supply bills for the Treasury and Postoffice Departments combined , the navy , the District of Columbia , the legislative establishments and the independent offices . Two supply measures , the first deficiency and that for the Interior Department have been passed by both branches of Congress and approved by the President . The Agricultural Department supply bill and the " four-department bill , " for State , Justice , Commerce and Labor , are before conferees of the House and Senate . The House is considering the War Department supply bill , and Congress will act late in tile session on the second deficiency bill .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
