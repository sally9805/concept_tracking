The hotheaded , toothbrush-mustached Spanish Catalan , Luis Companys , became a rebel when he added to the chaos of Spain 's October 1934 revolution by declaring his native province , rich , industrial Catalonia , an independent republic . He became a martyr when the Government sent him to jail for 30 years . He became a hero when the Left victory in the Spanish general election last month sent him and 30,000 other rebels of 1934 rollicking out of Spain 's jails . This week he became a liberator when he wangled from Spain 's Republican Premier Manuel Azaa " local autonomy " for Catalonia . In Spain old issues never die , and States ' Rights is the deathless battle cry of Catalonia &; Companys . <P> Moderate Premier Azaa had anticipated Companys ' States ' Rights demands , but he was flabbergasted last week by another demand of the Left parties that had put him into power . It was that Spanish employers be forced to take back every employe they had dismissed since Jan. 1 , 1934 , for any reason whatsoever . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ murdered loyal employes and bosses during the revolutionary troubles but also embezzling cashiers and dimwit incompetents.
