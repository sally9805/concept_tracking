txt The twenty-four silver-winged planes of General Italo Balbo 's air fleet rested tonight on the swiftly flowing St. Lawrence , outside this city , after a flight across land from Shediac , the sixth leg of their daring mass flight from Italy . One after another they settled on the water here today , while a crowd that lined the river bank watched them splash in to a landing and taxi to their stations . General Balbo 's plane laifded at 1:45 P. M. Eastern Daylight Time . having left Shediac at 9:51 A. M. The time for the 500-mile flight was 3 hours , 54 minutes . Tomorrow the Italian fliers will leave for Chicago on the last stage of their long transatlantic flight . - The line from Shediac to Montreal which General Balbo 's planes followed today was almost straight . It led across lakes and rivers , but it was hardly the sort of . route which a flying man would choose to follow in big boats unless he were willing to take a chance on a forced landing . That nothing happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the skill of the pilots . Much Speculation on Route . There was much speculation in Montreal this morning as to what route they would follow , for there was no intimation before the takeoff . It was soon after 1 o'clock when the first group of six planes , led by General Balbo , came into sight over the horizon . They were flying at about 1,500 feet , and , as they headed into the sun , the light flashed from their propellers and other gleaming metal parts . The drone of their tandem motors was dull in the distance and grew louder as they emerged from the haze which overhung the river valley . As they passed the jetty of the Fairchild seaplane base , where they were to land , the thousands gathered on the shore and those 1who had access to the jetty greeted them with a cheer . An Italian Fascist band played " La Giovanezza " and the lines of blackshirted Fascists on the jetty raised their arms in salute . ' They circled the lower part of Montreal and came back overland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun malting the white bodies of the ships brilliant . From a distance there was nothing to indicate the vicissitudes of the long-and dangerous voyage they had undertaken . They were as clean and brilliant in the air as when they started , their tricolored tails and colored wings taking on the same silvery aspect in the sunlight . Planes Arrive in Groups . The first group of two flights ? six planes all together  --  had landed and taxied to their moorings before the next group came in sight . As their heavy , double-pontooned bodies hit the water , they slowed up suddenly , and the motors roared again and blew spray out behind them as they jockeyed into their positions for the night . General Baibo has been heralded as a master of the spectacular in the air , but he did not live up to his reputation today . Perhaps he was playing safe because of the dangerous terrain over which his planes were flying . He could have massed them outside Montreal and come over at the head of a military formation ; instead he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ circling and landing became monotonous . It was not showmanship , but it was good technique . It was 2:23 P. M. when the last group of three arrived . Just before they Came in the crowd waiting on the jetty was treated to a masterly exhibition of ' formation flying . Three planes came in and winged their way overhead , their wing tips almost touching . In a perfect V. Their double motors sent down a deep salutation and their wings tipped together as they banked and turned inland and circled back to the river . When the entire fleet was ' anchored , it was nearly a half-hour more before General Balbo came ashore . He had taken the opportunity to change into his uniform . Cane in hand , he stepped on to the landing , as nattyas if he had just come off a warship . It was easy to pick him out because of his beard and his flashing smile as he saluted those who greeted him and happily shook hands . It was a moment that meant much to him . On the jetty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fisheries ; Major Gen. A. G. L. , chief of the General Staff of Canada ; Colonel Clyde Scott , military secretary ; Brigadier W. P. P. Gibsone , Sherman Fairchild , who did the announcing , and Wing Commander Anderson of the Royal Canadian Air Force . Behind them . stretching to the road , was a solid lane of Fascist guards and Fascist boys and girls , clad in black shirts and black skirts , the tri-color of Italy on their shirts and the Fascist insignia on their hats . As General Balbo landed they raised a cheer and lifted their arms in salute as the band played the Fascist hymn again . Balbo Salutes Fascists . Mr. Durandleau greeted General Balbo . Then the Italian flying general spoke a few words in his native tongue and raised his arm to his fellow-countrymen who waited for him . The band again played , and he walked down the Lane of vociferous Italians , followed by the welcoming committee and ether officials .

He was all smiles , tossng his arms around as he jested In French with the Montreal reporters . 7I will be ready to leave at any ime in the morning , " he said , " and hope to reach Chicago between ! our and six o'clock in the afterloon . That should give every one in opportunity to see us . " " How was the trip to Montreal ? " le was asked . " From Shediac to Montreal the ' lying was fairly good , " he said .

Premier Mussolini , he said , was well satisfied with the trip , had complimented him and his men on it , and declared it a splendid achievement for the Italian people in the eyes of the world . This was just after he had been to the telephone , talking with the Italian Premier . His eyes were beaming as he said : " Ah , Mussolini ! You do not I know what he means to us .
