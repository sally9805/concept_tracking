a moment Jerry added , " He is a reputable lawyer and a very thorough Christian gentleman . " The black bishop repeated thoughtfully : " Mr. Jefferson Ashton . . . " and then looked at the girl . The high-cream girl with the apprehensive eyes shook her head faintly at a moment when Jerry was not watching . The black bishop gave a nervous frown . " Mr. Ashton is a very good lawyer and an excellent man . We were just wondering , Dr. Catlin , and that is why I took the great liberty of stopping you on the street . Mr. Ashton may need help , because this is a very serious case ; he may need help and advice , and we were wondering if we could get some other attorney to assist in the defense ? " " Who is we ' ? " asked Jerry . " A society among us colored people , " explained the bishop in a respectful voice . " Why do n't you just go to a lawyer and hire him ? " " Because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's office on such an errand , it would be dangerous for him , it would be at the risk of his life . Besides that , no lawyer in town would accept the case if a colored man offered to retain him . " Jerry felt an impulse to deny this , then ignored it . " Now , just what do you want to see me about ? " The black bishop cleared his throat and began with atroubled face : " If we succeed in getting any lawyer at all to defend these boys , Dr. Catlin , some white man will have to engage him for us . And it wo n't be a simple retaining . He would have to show some white attorney that after all these black boys are human beings ; that one of them is just a child , thirteen or fourteen years old . It is almost impossible for the child to have committed the offense charged against him . And they are all quite without friends , Dr. Catlin . They have n't seen a colored man since they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me for such an undertaking , Sin-ton ? "  | " I did n't , " stated the negro at once , " Rose there chose you . I told her to look at the faces of the men as they went past the alley and try to speak to the man with the kindestlookingeyes . She may not have known who you were her-self . " " Yes , I knew , " said the girl , " my grandmother cooked for Dr. Catlin 's Aunt Rose Vaiden . . . I was named for her . " " You are Miss Tony 's granddaughter ? " queried Jerry , interested . " Yes , sir . " " Who was your mother ? " " Jinny Lou Sparkman . " Jerry remembered Jinny Lou , a yellow child with dark eyes and black curls . This information that the girl 's people had worked in his family formed a humanizing touch for Jerry . He felt more kindly toward her , and toward the negro man . He decided he would tell them the course determinedupon at the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a gentler tone , " I do n't know whether you have thought of it or not , but the trial and conviction and execution of these boys will have a deep bearing on the future of the colored people all over the South . " " Yes , we know that , too , " agreed the black man , " that 's why our society is stirred up about it . " " Yes , but had you ever asked yourselves if you were stirred up in the right way ? " " How do you mean ? " " I mean , if the boys are hanged , the next case of assault will probably be brought into court , too . It will set a precedent . The people of Alabama will have confidence in their courts . They can be persuaded to let such cases come to trial instead of taking violent and illegal action . You know very well such a precedent settled into custom would be a thousand times better for the colored race than the present state of things . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why should we not have the best lawyer in town ? " " Because you would lose the whole point of the trial . The best lawyer would certainly prolong the trial and might easily set the culprits free . The next mob would remember that and would certainly claim their victims while they were sure of them . No , the very point is for them to have an ordinary lawyer who will not abuse justice with every technicalitythe law provides . " The bulky black man stood on widely planted feet chewingthis . " In other words , " he said slowly , " if a colored man is accused of attacking a white woman , no matter whether he is guilty or not , he must be lynched either by a white mob or by a white court . " " No , " snapped the assistant minister , quite out of temper ; " if these boys are proved innocent to the satisfaction of the jury , they will be liberated . The important thing is that no improper technicalities be used to drag out the trial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . why is it more improper to use technicalities to defend a negro than anyone else ? Technicalitiesare used against negroes in Southern courts year in and year out ; why not use them for them once ? " Jerry 's patience gave out completely . " Ca n't you see , Sinton , it is not a matter of justice , it is a matter of policy ? Justice is defeated endlessly in American courts , North and South , but right at this moment it is good policy , it is the hope of the black people of Alabama , that justice be administered . It will make safe in the future hundreds of thousands of black lives . . . that 's all I 've got to say . " And Jerry turned and walked angrily out of the anteroom door . The assistant minister reentered Courthouse Square more subtly irritated because there was a certain cogency in the black preacher 's logic which he himself had glimpsed before he had gone into the hotel . Another disturbing point was that he had followed a negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none of the white men knew that Rose Sparkman was a negress . Now , as Jerry hurried to rejoin his companions in Ashton 's office , the thought came to him that all this turmoil about the six negroes was really an effort of the white race to protect their racial purity against negro blood , and this very cream-colored girl who had called him aside was a subtler and more uncontrollable threat against a purely Anglo-Saxon South than all the negro men the county jail would hold . He turned into Ashton 's office , which was the corner building on the alley which led to the jail . As he entered he heard Sanborne saying : " Jefferson , we are asking you to do this out of patriotism for your country . " " But , listen , " cried Ashton earnestly , " how would you men like to stand up and defend six black beasts . . . " " Wait ! " begged old man Bradley in a voice muffled by his cigar . " Jeff , my boy , how many doctors do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wished were Brad and in hell , but their Hippocratic oath would n't let ' tin flicker ? Now , the oath you took to enter the Florence bar means the same thing . You swore to uphold justice , the laws of Alabama , and the Constitution of the United States . A I I right , the laws of Alabama guarantee every accused the right of counsel ; a man skilled in the law and in the conduct of cases . . . . Jefferson , we 're going to recommend to Judge Wilson to draft you . " Attorney Ashton stood nervously fingering a criminal code of Alabama that lay on a littered table : " It 'll disgrace me . " " Not a soul in the courthouse but what 'll know the Judge appointed you , that your heart is on the other side and nothing but your integrity as a lawyer and a citizen causes you to defend niggers you know damn well deserve to be Bung !  --  " Besides that , " added Sanborne , " your cross-examinationp104and your speech of defense will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Mr. Jefferson Ashton wrinkled his brows , made a last clutch at the code , but visibly weakened . He had never in his life taken part in a trial of any prominence . Suits with notoriety , if not fame , passed him by with monotonous regularity . That was why he could never get any big cases to handle , because he had never had one . If he could just get one really dangerous case and get his rep up in the county , he 'd be made . If he could contrive some extraordinarylegal trick and set all six of the negroes scot free .. . he certainly would be made ! " Gentlemen , " he said aloud , " although not for my right arm would I loose such criminals on the public , still , I 'll go into their cases , spread the exact evidence before judge and jury without exaggeration , without false emphasis , with a plea that strict and accurate justice be done to my clients . If Judge Wilson will accept that assurance , you may tender my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The men assured him earnestly that he had taken a praiseworthy stand , and Bradley admonished him to write down what he had just said for his speech before the jury . Jerry Catlin was on tenterhooks to get the other members of the committee out of Ashton 's office . When he succeeded in herding them on the pavement he said : " Look here , the niggers are about to hire Sandusky for the defense ! " " How do you know ? " " A nigger preacher named Sinton told me that moment ; he wanted me to see Sandusky for him . " " He has n't seen him yet ? " " I do n't think so . " " Listen , " said Sanborne to all the committee , " we 've got to telephone Sandusky and retain him for the prosecution ! " " How much will he cost , and who 'll pay it ? " asked another of the committee.  | " Hell , it makes no difference what he 'll cost ! " ejaculated Bradley . " If he ever gits his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't he wo n't . What we got to do is retain him ! " So the five men sought the nearest telephone and finished up their duty as keepers of the public morals by engaging one lawyer for the defense and retaining another for the prosecution.  | WHEN the legal scouting party returned to the bank with their report , such a number of men were waiting to see Colonel Vaiden that even they could not go straight into his private office . Miss Katie , the telephone girl in the bank 's house exchange , told the quintet that she could n't disturb Colonel Milt not even for Miss Marsan , who at that moment was waiting outside in her car . Old man Bradley and young Mr. Sanborne grew curious at once . The peril of the six negro rapists ' obtaining competentcounsel passed out of their minds , and they wondered who was closeted with the Colonel , and did it mean a new subdivision on the market , and who were the men behind it ? Old man Bradley asked in his artless countrified fashion : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , Miss Katie ? " The well trained exchange girl answered politely : " I did n't say he was in a consultation , I said he was in a conference . " " That 's diff'runt , " nodded Bradley , taking the cigar from his lips and tapping the end . Miss Katie silently pushed him an ash tray . " It 's the damnedest thing , " thought old man Bill to himself , moving about the waiting room and trying to get a glimpse through the door of the inner office , " It 's the damnedest thing , old man Milt Vaiden keep me coolin ' my heels in his waiting room when just a few years ago me and Frierson and old man John Han'back had him in jail for stealin ' . " And he thumped his ash on a rug . The conference about which old man Bradley was so curious and Miss Katie so uncommunicative was composed  |p107of  the executive force of the bank : The cashier , the first and second vice presidents , the secretary and treasurer , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some stock , and two of the directors made up the consulting body . The Colonel as president had on the table before him an application for a loan of forty-seven thousand , seven hundred and fifty dollars to be spent on a subdivision to be opened along Shoal Creek , west of Florence . The Colonel , as chairman , sat slowly shaking his white head and jaundiced face . " No , gentlemen , no . . . the land value is n't there . " " But the man himself is going to put in fifty thousand dollars cash , " persisted the secretary and treasurer ; " that will be ninety-seven thousand , seven hundred and fifty dollars in improvements . . . bound to be worth the **30;2700;TOOLONG he wants . " " Forty-seven thousand , seven hundred and fifty , " correctedthe Colonel . " All right . . . that 's not half of the money he asks us to lay out . " " It 's half of the money that can be got out of it when this boom breaks , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom breaks , " stressed the teller , who was young but very bright and owned some stock . " I mean when it breaks , " repeated the Colonel briefly . Mr. Pingree , who was a grocer most of the time and a bank director at odd hours like this , arose to his feet . " Mr. President and gentlemen of the executive committee , we know , of course , that this boom wo n't always remain at such a pitch as it is at present , BUT look how Birmingham went straight up from nothing to a hundred and forty thousand population . " " Birmingham is a place where iron and coal are found together , " interrupted the Colonel . " Well , have n't we got an endless mine of white coal in the government power plant ? " demanded Mr. Pingree , " and iron right at us in Russellville ? "  |p108The  first vice president said : " Gentlemen , I think we can leave Birmingham out of this question . We want to know can we go into this deal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom . There is no way to finance a boom without taking a risk . But what is our risk ? If the worst happens , it will be a wait . That Shoal Creek property with all the improvements they are going to put on it is worth forty-seven thousand dollars . . . . " " Forty-seven , seven fifty , " corrected the old Colonel impatiently . The first vice president repeated the correction dutifully . The Colonel was getting old and had to be humored . He was with age losing his speculative nerve , that nerve which , a few decades ago , had caused him to seize another man 's fortune , tell him about it , brazen it out through the courts with him , and finally keep it . He had been a wonderful man once . The secretary and treasurer asked if the Colonel wanted to see the Second National just sit on its roll and see the other Tri-City banks gobble up the whole boom . Mr. Ragsdale , the bank 's lawyer , who was the other directorof the bank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn down such a reasonable loan as this , it will certainly get abroad , and it will have a bad effect on the boom itself . When the people see this bank is skeptical , they 'll get skeptical . " The old Colonel looked at the speaker . " Mr. Ragsdale , if the boom has got that far along so soon , our bank had better get out from under the whole thing while we can . " " Well , that 's my idea , Colonel , " said Ragsdale with legal dryness . " I 'm ready for the question . " " Send for Miss Katie , " directed the Colonel , " I want her to make a record of the ayes and nays for our minutes . " When Miss Katie appeared Miltiades began dictating before she was fairly in her seat . " A loan of forty-seven thousand , seven hundred and fiftyp109dollars , payable in semiannual installments , on the Shoal Creek property lying west of Florence in Range 16 Sections 8-9-10 to Lerganthall and Barth . " Miss Katie glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the routine question : " And who owns the property ... who takes first mortgage over the bank 's mortgage ? " " I do ; I 'm selling it , " said the Colonel.  | WHEN Miss Katie had finished her work in the conference room she asked the Colonel if he would see Marsan , who was waiting in her car . The old banker asked how many were before Marsan . Miss Katie glanced at a list and read over a number of names ending with Mr. Jerry and Mr. Bradley and those men who went to see about the lawyer . The Colonel nodded at this important committee , which he had half forgot . " Oh yes . . . about the niggers ... send them in ahead of the others . " The Colonel was very tired that day , not physically or mentally , but spiritually tired . He wanted to leave the bank and drive with Marsan along the river , seeing perhaps an anachronistic steamboat and going back home by way of the new cathedral , but on this afternoon he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hour . So he said to Miss Katie : " Tell Marsan not to wait , but to come back in an hour and a half . . . . If she has something else to do , let her send Wilson . " When Miss Katie went outside of the bank to deliver this message , she found Marsan waiting in her car talking to a middle-sized brunet man who stood with a hand on the car window . " Miss Katie , how long before Papa can see Mr. Petrie ? " asked the girl . The information clerk referred to her list and counted up.  | " There are seventeen ahead of him , Miss Marsan , " said information , " that 's counting five men as one . " " Do you mean there are eighty-five men waiting ? " asked Petrie , out of hope . " Oh no , that 's just the last five that count one , all the rest of them are  --  are one apiece , you know . " The crowd around the door laughed at the information girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Look here , if I ca n't see him for an hour and a half neither can you . " She looked at him quizzically and smiled . " What do you want to know , anyway ? " . " Well . . . I wanted to ask him about the advisability of making an investment . " There came a little pause . Mr. Petrie took his hand off the car to let it back out . " Listen , " suggested Marsan on the impulse , " if we both have to wait on Dad , you might as well drive around with me till the time 's up . . . I mean , if you 'd like to . " An apprehension flickered through Petrie 's mind that if he became too friendly with Marsan she might scamp her work at school and rely on his favoritism to pull her through . ( ; iris almost invariably did that . Aloud he said , " That 's tine , " and stepped into the car . Marsan asked him where he wanted to drive , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its view of the dam from the bridge . " Yes , we ought to look at the dam , " agreed Petrie , " since it caused both the boom and the trial . " " Did it cause the trial ? " " Yes , the negroes were beating their way to the dam in a box car ; they hoped to find work here . The dam was a contributorycause to the incident . " Marsan drove for several seconds in silence , and through her mind there moved a pensive , almost a mournful sequence of thoughts . The dam had brought the negroes and so had collected the mob which had insulted her father . This insult had led Red McLaughlin to protect her and had caused her to give to Red her first gift , as a woman , to a man . It had all flowed out of the dam . Aloud she said : " It 's odd how circumstances twist people about . I suppose endless other things will be caused by that dam . . . endless . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Petrie . " We call it Chance and Luck , and Happen-so , because we are not so dignified as the Greeks . " " We do n't believe in Luck and Chance , " said Marsan . " We are supposed not to , even when it happens all round us , " said Petrie . " We are not as direct as the Greeks . They accepted Chance as Fate and elevated it to the will of the gods . We build up our gods and pray to them , trying to overcome Chance and Fate . But we 've never really been able to do it , and so our gods have more or less ceased to function . That 's why you came to me the other afternoon with your question : you were disturbed about your gods . For our deity we have installed Cause and Effect , that 's what rules us . The trouble is we feel the Effect and then with much pain figure out the Cause , but it is all over by that time , and there is nothing we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Greek idea of Chance or Fate . " " Yes , but you say we figure out the Cause with much pain . We do that so the next time that thing comes up we 'll know and we can avoid what 's unpleasant . " " That sounds very practical , " agreed Mr. Petrie ; " the trouble is nothing ever happens twice alike , but assuming that things did and could happen twice alike , and their causes be determined , then men could prepare themselves ; the catch is that the set of causes you have figured out are the effects of causes still more remote . You have shoved Chance back a notch or two , but you have made it more mysterious and inscrutable . " The school teacher looked at the girl driving , " Do you know what I 'm talking about , Marsan ? " Marsan drew a long breath . " Oh yes , I know . " P113Petrie gave a deprecatory smile . " I seem to grow indiscreet when I talk with you . You 're a dangerous person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you start thinking like that ? " asked the girl intently . " What happened to you ? " " What makes you think anything happened to me ? " " Why , it would have to ... you could n't start just thinkinglike that without any reason at all . " Petrie laughed . " There you are , doing exactly what I described , pursuing our Anglo-Saxon god of Cause . If I told you what happened to me , you would want to know how that came about , would n't you ? " The girl smiled . " I suppose I would . " After a moment she added , " I see you are n't going to tell me either one . " Mr. Petrie 's sober face took on a funny expression , but he sat in silence , looking at the Florence bridge which they were approaching . Marsan had an uncomfortable feeling that he was laughing at . her ; to recover herself she began talking about the affairs of the day ; Ashton 's appointment to defend the negroes , which she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much of a lawyer . . . I suppose that 's the point , " said Petrie . Marsan was shocked . " Do you mean Judge Wilson is going to appoint Mr. Ashton so the negroes will lose ? " " I suppose that 's the idea . " Marsan looked at her companion with horror-struck eyes . " Why , I think that 's terrible ! " " Did you think the lynching they nearly pulled off was ouch a bad thing ? " " Not as bad as this . " " What difference does it make whether they lynch the Degroes with a mob or a jury ? "  | " Why , a lot . . . a mob is at least honest . " " Huh . . . " said Petrie , " m  --  huh . . . " and he looked at the girl with a new intereest . " Now do n't think I was defendingthe jury , Marsan . . . I was n't . " " Could n't somebody do something about it ? " cried the girl . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . at least , not here in the South . " " Is anybody interested anywhere ? " " Well . . . no-o . . . probably not . . . not away down here in Alabama . In the North they-have an association to protect negroes from injustices . It 's called the Association for the Betterment of Colored People . " " Where is it ? " " In New York . " " What 's the street address ? " " I do n't know . . . New York ' would get it , I fancy . " Marsan pressed her foot on the accelerator , and the car shot down the river hill onto the bridge . As the machine hummed toward Sheffield the girl asked : " How came you to know about this association ? " " Well . . . it attempted to do something for a college mate of mine once . " " What did it try to do ? " " Get him established in a prize position which he had won . " " Did it do it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position ? " " A fellowship in a big research laboratory in Schenectady . " " How did he win it ? " " In a competitive examination . " " What in ? " " Metallurgy . " " Lot of folks take it ? " " Oh yes , four from the Pittsburgh Tech , and I do n't know how many other colleges . " P115Marsan suddenly remembered Mr. Petrie 's microscope and his hobby of collecting pieces of iron . " You know because you studied metallurgy ? " she hazarded . " Yes , I majored in metallurgy , " he admitted uncomfortably . A still more dramatic question leaped into Marsan 's head , but she censored it as unaskable . But she wondered if he had . . . she wondered poignantly if he really had . And as she was thinking firmly to herself that she must never under any circumstances ask such a question , she said in an odd voice : " Mr. . . . Mr. Petrie . . . d-did you take it too ? " " Yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my goodness ! " gasped the girl . A nigger had beaten Mr. Petrie ! A nigger in a metallurgicalexamination in Pittsburgh ! Beaten Mr. Petrie , who knew all the things that were ! It sounded irrational . . . fantastic . " But you say he did n't get it after all ? " " No , " said Petrie gravely , " when Denison went up to go to work , they saw he was a negro and let him out somehow . . . I never learned the particulars . " " I declare ! I just declare . . . " Marsan could hardly go on with her thinking . After a while she said : " I suppose you were glad of it ? " " No-o . . . I was n't . . . I was awfully sorry for Denison . While we were studying together in the Pittsburgh Tech . 1 never really thought of him as a negro . We had a Hindu and a Mexican there too , that helped the feeling along . I suppose that he was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time I realized that Denison was really a Georgia nigger was when he won .

I was sorry . I was damn sorry . Some- how it seemed to me the most pathetic thing I ever heard of . " - The big Vaiden car scorned the miles between Florence and Sheffield in a contemptuous murmur . Marsan spun up to and stopped before the railroad station . She slammed open the door , jumped out , and went running inside at a basketballgait . Professor J. Adlee Petrie , scientist , but not so grand a scientist as he had been five minutes before , remained in the car wondering in distraction why he had ever told Marsan Vaiden such a chapter in his life history . If it got out , what would it do to him in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . what seventeen-year-old girl could keep such a secret as that ! A small shabby old woman came walking past the car , glanced at it , paused , looked at it more closely , and finally came over and asked in a thin voice : " Ai n't that Brother Jerry Catlin 's car ? " Petrie had no desire to waste words on her . " No , it is n't . " " It 's the same color . . . it 's the same shape . . . it 's the same size . . . " she walked around it , " it 's the same license number ... do n't any two cars have the same license number , do they ? " Petrie recalled that Jerry Catlin was connected in some way or other with the Vaiden family . " It may be the same , but it does n't belong to Catlin , it belongs to the Vaidens . " " Will you be seeing Brother Catlin ? " " Not if I can help it . " " Lawzee , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . I just do n't know him very well . " " Do n't you want to see nobody you do n't know verywell ? " " Listen , I 'll see him for you ... what do you want me to say to him ? " " I 've got a little message .... " P117At that moment Marsan came out of the depot . " Marsan , " called Petrie , " here 's a woman with a little message for your cousin Jerry . " " Who are you ? " asked the girl . " My name 's Swartout . " " And what did you want me to tell Cousin Jerry ? " " Tell him Luggy told Junior Petman how many wordsthey was in morningglory and nobody else knowed , not eventhe grown folks at the party , ast him how he explains that ? " " What ? " The old woman repeated what she had just said , word for word and accent for accent . " What does it mean ? " " Your cousin 'll know what it means . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you got me there , miss . " The little old woman gave a kind of a grunt of a laugh of long-accustomed wonder . " Well . . . who is Junior Petman ? " " Now I can tell you that . He 's the little afflicted boy that lives across the lane . " As Marsan could get nothing more out of her than this , she wrote the message down exactly as Mrs. Swartout dictated , because it was impossible to remember such a string of words . The shabby old woman gave brief dry thanks , as very poor people always try to show in their gratitude that they are just as good as the person whom they are thanking . When Marsan and Petrie started back to Florence , Petrie asked if Jerry could make heads or tails out of the message for Marsan please to relay the interpretation to him . The girl promised she would by telephone and took his number at the old house on Tombigbee Street . " Marsan . . . do n't mention what I told you , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do n't worry . . . folks do n't get things out of me as easily as they do out of you . " On their return trip they drove slowly across the Florence bridge to look at the dam , which had been their objective from the first . It lay far up the river like a low modern fortress stretched from shore to shore . " What did you do in the Sheffield depot ? " asked Petrie idly as he looked at the white blotch of cataracts at the foot of the dam . " Oh , I telegraphed that society you told me about . " " What society ? " " Why , the one that protects niggers . . . . I told them they were hanging six niggers down here and they would n't allow ' em to have a lawyer . " " Marsan ! " cried Petrie . " I hope you did n't do that ! " " Yes , I did . " " I hope you did n't get the address right ! " " I sent it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . New York . " " For God 's sake , Marsan ! " The teacher sat staring at the girl . After a moment he added : " That 's the right address . "  |p119MR  . J. ADLEE PETRIE and Marsan reached the bank door somewhere near the hour and a half limit . Miss Katie 's waiting list had been checked off , and the school teacher was admitted to the Colonel 's private office . The gayety which Petrie had felt with Marsan vanished abruptly in the presence of the old banker with his yellowed face and bright wrinkled old eyes . A certain faintly superciliousfeeling of being broadly educated , of taking informed and scientific views of life fell away from the school teacher in the Colonel 's presence . Petrie remembered , ' as who did not , that the Colonel had founded his fortune on theft , but the old man 's adroit handling of his original fortune had somehow completely expunged his misstep . That long past offense certainly detracted nothing now from his aura of magistral wisdom and fortressed and inscrutable integrity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had been a depositor in the Second National Bank for four years .

" Yes , I know , I sold the place , I owned it for a number of years . " This disconcerted the scientist , but he went ahead with his questions , although he had the grace to put his next in a negative form :   " Then you would n't advise me to  --  to buy it ?

" " Well , I . . . teach science in the High School , " said Petrie , using the circumlocution to avoid coming out and stating flatly what he was . " Then I . . .

" P121The old man 's correct guess at how much Petrie had in the bank ironed out much of the scientist 's resentment . " Look here , " said Petrie , calm and sincere once more , " a man ca n't get on and do well off the salary I 'm making . If I ever have anything I 've got to invest in something .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What I would say may not have much application now , " replied the Colonel . " What would you say ? " inquired Petrie . " My rule is , my advice is , Mr. Petrie , always buy when other men want to sell , and sell when other men want to buy . So all the advice I could give you is to sell off what you 've got . " " But I  --  I have n't anything , " said Petrie , uncomfortable again . " That 's why I said I was afraid my advice wouldn'tbe applicable to you , " explained the Colonel gently . Petrie stood looking at him for five seconds longer . " Thank you , Colonel , good-day . " And he put on his hat and went out the door . The old Colonel himself sat at his desk pulling at his wrinkled mouth with a kind of smile on his lips and a touch of sympathy in his heart . He wondered if Petrie would now go buy the lot anyway ? He probably would . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if honey-coated temper was that the third man before Mr. Petrie who was admitted to his private office had made the Colonel thoroughly angry . The offender had been Bodine , organizer of the secret society to spread Americanism and stamp out Jews , negroes , and Catholics . During his visit to the bank , however , Bodine was interestedonly secondarily in canvassing for his society . He really wanted to know the commercial rating of Lerganthall and Barth and obtain information as to their business ability and honesty . Miltiades had recommended the firm with his accustomed reservations ; they were very good men , energetic , aggressive , honest in their dealings with the bank . " And as trustworthyas their business will allow . " Bodine was a heavy man with blue bulging eyes . " What do you mean by as trustworthy as their business allows ? " asked the organizer , with the frown of a blustery man who wishes to appear profound . " I count the probability of success in a man 's operations as part of his general trustworthiness , " explained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an air of wisdom . " Yes . . . I see that ... and do you think Lerganthall and Barth will probably succeed ? " Miltiades pulled at his chin . " The bank has assisted them in one or two ventures .. . however , it has assisted nearly every other firm in town .. . and a certain percentage of them fail . " Bodine lifted his head up and down . " I see you are a man of caution , Colonel Vaiden . . . so am I. By the way , Lerganthall and Barth 's property along Cypress Creek , it 's bound to be a big residential section one of these days , do n't you think ? " " It 's rather far out of town , " pointed out Miltiades . " Yes , but consider , Colonel Vaiden , the tendency in cities of today toward suburban development . " " That 's true ... in cities . " " Do n't you think Cypress Creek would make marvelous sites for beautiful well wooded estates ? " " You do have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his tongue to his thin , faintly smiling lips . " There you are , " rolled Bodine with satisfaction , " we have the woods , the scenic creek , bathing , canoeing , horsebackriding . . . . Mr. Barth even visions a flying field . . . what do you think of that , Colonel ? " " That 's fine . " The old banker paused , and after a moment added , " Barth 's a Northern man , is n't he ? " " Yes , I believe he is . Why did you say that ? "   " Because Northern people bathe and canoe and horseback ride . " " Why , they do it in Birmingham , in Atlanta , in New Orleans . . . all the big cities . " The Colonel nodded pacifyingly . " All I did was to ask if Barth was from the North , and you said he was . " " Well . . . yes . . . that 's correct , " conceded Bodine , as if he had checked over a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Colonel decided to waste no more words on Bodine . The organizer was the sort of man who greatly impressed ordinary people and for whom an aristocratic person formed an instinctive dislike on first sight . So now Miltiades remainedpolitely silent , waiting for the fellow to take his departure . Mr. William Yancey Bodine , however , for that was his name , had arrived only at the second phase of his mission . He cleared his throat , changed his voice to a broadly flatteringtone : " Colonel Vaiden , I have been thinking about you . " " Yes ? " queried the banker dryly . " Yes , I have . You have great influence in Florence , Colonel ; you 're a force in your community . " Miltiades waited impassively . " I know , Colonel , Florence knows , Alabama knows , that first , last , and always , you 're an American citizen , sir , a citizen of the United States of America , sir . " Bodine shook a heavy fist at these periods , as if defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you come in on my citizenship ? " inquired the Colonel . " I do n't come in at all , sir , not personally , but I represent an organization , sir , of pure-blooded Americans upholding pure Americanism . It is an unselfish organization of patriots , sir , impelled by the highest motives that ever stirred the human heart to deed of heroism . I refer , sir , to the love of one 's country . . . I know you love your country , Colonel Vaiden . " The Colonel looked straight at Bodine . " My country was crushed , overrun , poisoned , and pollutedyears ago , Mr. Bodine . " The organizer stared at the old man . " Why do n't you consider this your country ? " " It 's where I 'm living . It 's a place without leisure , without finesse . Look at those six negroes thrown in jail ! Why were they ever permitted to run loose in the first place ? It is as outrageous as it would be to allow a vicious stud @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and set to work . Rapes would n't happen if the niggers had plenty of work , but a mawkish sentimentality brought down here by Yankees ... " Bodine considered the Colonel 's kidney . He had handled old Confederate soldiers before . " Colonel , nobody in the world has a greater respect for the ideals of the old South than I have . But I say we are not lost . The South is just as much the South today as it was before the Civil War . Only nowadays we are in the midst of another battle , more insidious , more subversive than an open appeal to arms . " That is why I am asking you , Colonel Vaiden , to join our mystic brotherhood who are bound together by ties of loyalty , fraternity , equality , and help hurl back this second invader of our Southland . " " Who do you want to hurl back ? " asked the Colonel , rather ashamed of ever expressing a sentiment to Bodine . " The nigger , the Catholic , the Jew , " quoted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ six niggers are still alive ! " " The shame reaches back to ' sixty-four , Bodine , when they were dumped into our commonwealth as citizens , but since they have been dumped , it is obligatory upon us to consider them as citizens and surround them with all the safeguards of the law . " " Well , they may not be hanged if they come to trial . "   " That 's the problem we are struggling with today , Bodine , and I feel we have this particular case arranged for . " Bodine was discomfited . He had thought the Colonel was about to come over on his side , but here he was settling back just where he had started . " Well , look here , " he demanded , " what do you think about the Catholics ? " " I do n't think anything about them . " " Do n't you believe the Pope 's trying to run this country , just like he tried to run Mexico ? Do n't you believe the Protestantpeople ought to chase ' em @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't subscribe to that , Bodine , " said Miltiades , becoming amused now that the topic had shifted from his personal sore ; " we have a number of Catholic accounts here in the bank I 'd hate to see withdrawn . " Bodine blew up . " My God , I hope you would n't let a dollar stand between you and your duty as a citizen . . . and look at the Jews .. . do n't you know they have a money trust that 's turning the whole United States into a business organization run entirely for the benefit of the Jews ? " " Bodine , " suggested Miltiades with a twinkle in his eyes , " are you aware that Mr. Lerganthall , your partner in the Cypress Creek development , is a Jew ? " Bodine 's highly colored face grew redder than ever . " Hell , while they 're here , we might as well use ' em . You ca n't keep ' em from making money , and you might as well let ' em make some for you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews and Pt icks up to its principles , I 'll join you , Bodine , " agreed NI iltiades suavely . " What a hell of a way for you to talk , throwing up a dollar to me ! " boomed Bodine . " You 'll let your country be ruled by Catholics so as to save their bank accounts , and you 'll turn niggers aloose on the women in your own family because you 're afraid , if you lynch ' em , the damn Yankees wo n't buy your land . . . . "   The old banker sprang to his feet and jerked shakily at the drawer of his desk . " Bodine , get out of here before I blow your damned insolent brains out ! You beefy , addle-headed wind-bag ! Get out of here ! " And the Colonel brought a blue steel automatic above the level of his desk . Bodine walked out silently and fairly quickly with what dignity he could muster at that gait . He thought , without looking back , " You damned yellow skeleton , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said nothing , and was careful to give the furious old man no further outward cause of offense.  |p127I  T WAS this unpleasantness with Bodine that had caused the old Colonel to deal so crustily with J. Adlee Petrie . When the school teacher finally left the bank , Miss Katie telephonedthe Colonel that his list was cleared , and the old man arose , still shaky from his anger . The waiting room was empty save for Miss Katie arrangingher desk for the night . The Colonel went on out into the street where Marsan sat patiently awaiting him in the car . When she saw his face she called out anxiously : " What 's the matter , Daddy ? " The old man made a gesture . " The fools I have to talk to ! " The girl opened the door for him . " What makes you talk to them ? . . . You do n't have to . " That was an old debate that arose in the Vaiden manor at odd intervals : why the Colonel continued at the bank , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his wrinkled jaw to be pressed by Marsan 's delicately rouged cheek . " Where do you want to drive ? " she asked . " Up Pine Street . " " Not along the river today ? " " No , I do n't want to see steamboats . I do n't want to ace anything men have bet their money on and lost . I never heard of anybody betting on a cathedral . . . so far , have you ? " Marsan drew in her lips to cover a smile . " Would you like to go around and meet Dr. Blankenship ? " The old Colonel looked at his daughter . " Why , Marsan ! "  | " I was joking , Daddy . " " Honey , you should n't joke about religious matters . We never did at home ... Polycarp . . . Augustus . . . Cassandra ... none of us . " Marsan thought of the long roll of her aunts and uncles with their clear-cut sins and virtues . It must have been comfortingto know exactly the one from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marsan , back in the days of her father 's youth , the very sins of the people were tonic experiences illustrating evil and promoting virtue , but nowadays who knew which was which ? As she drove along , her own experience with Red McLaughlincame to her mind . She recalled that they had used this very seat on which she and her father now sat , and it made her ashamed . And yet there was nothing to be ashamed of . . . it was a universal biological impulse . She knew unmarriedgirls developed neuroses if they persisted in abstention , and fell into moral degeneration if they indulged . It sifted down to a matter of taste as to what sort of catastrophe a girl would choose . However , now , Marsan wished she had continued virginal until she married , if she ever married , and her science teacher , Mr. Petrie , floated into and out of her mind . This in turn recalled the negro who had beaten Mr. Petrie in the metallurgical examination , and this reminded her of the six negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have turned round and round like a squirrel in a cage , when her father rescued her from this unprofitable circle by ejaculating : " Riding . . . canoeing . . . tchk ! " Marsan looked at him . " What 's the matter with them ? " " They are not done any more . " " I 've ridden . . . . Mamma used to ride till she got too fat and lazy . " " I mean men . If a man rides he must do it in a motorcarp129at not less than fifty miles an hour . If he makes an investmentit must net him three hundred percent . per annum or the investor will change to something else . There is no sense of leisure in anything any more . " " How did folks get like that ? " asked Marsan , looking at her hands on the wheel and thinking they needed manicuring . " Because the nigger has been set free . Slaves and plantationsbrought a sense of leisure and a sense of responsibility toward God which no turn of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original American idea of a family , it enlarged and ennobled it into that of a patriarchy . It produced leisure and culture and that deep wide responsibility without which men drift into hedonism and dilettantism . The Yankees not only set aside the ordainedinstitution of slavery , they have set aside the ordinanceof marriage with universal divorce , and courtesy with universal boorishness . " " Southern people get divorces too . " " That 's because people mimic men with money , no matter ow sad an example they set . " Here the car stopped before the foundation of the new Cathedral . The old banker ceased his fulminations and sat ' king at it , but his thoughts ran on as mordantly as ever . Presently Marsan cried out : " There 's Cousin Jerry in the door of the old church . I ave a message for him . " " Who from ? " " An old woman named Swartout . " " I want to see Jerry , too , " said the old banker , and they both climbed out and went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old church Jerry waved at his kinsfolk . He had come to the door because he had been stoning , half unconsciously , for a motorcar to stop at the urb . The purring sound of the big Vaiden car which he had Bard was not the rattletrap which he had been expecting , but still he was not absolutely sure , so finally he went out to see . It was Marsan and her father . The daughter lifted a hand at him and called , in the gay inflections of a young girl : " Got a message for you , Cousin Jerry . " " Yes , what is it ? " Marsan waggled her hands about her head to show completebewilderment . " That 's what I 've come to ask you about . I ca n't make heads or tails of it . " Then she added that her father , too , wanted to see Jerry . The old banker said : " Take her first , find out what she wants . I 'm in no rush but she 's in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ live . " " Daddy , you know I wo n't take up Cousin Jerry 's time with you waiting . " As she said this she got out the note that Mrs. Swartout had dictated . " Now , what does this mean ? " she inquired in a puzzled tone . " The old woman said you would know . " It required a few seconds before Jerry could place the message , and then he explained to Marsan the old story about Junior Petman and Luggy . The old banker interposed : " Why do they come to you with such superstitions as that , Jerry ? " " Why , Daddy , " put in Marsan reproachfully , " how can you call that superstition when you know in what a queer way you got your deed back ! " The old banker clicked , " Tchk ! Tchk ! This would n't be like that . Besides , this is a baby . It 's too young for anything ... real to happen to it . And my deed did n't come back to me through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . If there had really been anything supernatural to it , why could n't Polycarp have just brought me the deed ? " The old Colonel was talking about a very strange incident in his life , when something which he thought had been hisP131dead brother Polycarp had appeared to Landers , who was now dead , and had told Landers where Miltiades would find the deed to some property which was in a lawsuit . " There you are , " said Jerry , " why could n't he ? " " I do n't think it was anything at all , " said Miltiades . " Looking back at it , I have decided it was nothing at all . " The Colonel then said he would like to speak to Jerry a few minutes . Jerry said certainly and asked his uncle into the small anteroom where he worked . When the two were by themselves the Colonel began tentatively : " Jerry , are you very happy in your service here ? " " Do you mean in my immediate tasks ? . . . Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you doing ? " " At present I am organizing the Sunday Schools of North Alabama , getting up subscriptions to build what we call the Children 's Arch . . . it is n't exactly the line I wanted to grow in . It was n't my intention to become a financier . " " That is n't all you do ? " " No , I plan picnics for Sunday-school classes . I teach weekday religious school on Fridays . Once a month I mimeographa bulletin of the cathedral 's progress and send it out to everyone who has subscribed ten dollars , and to people we hope will subscribe ... and so on . " " On the whole , it is n't what you want ? " " Well . . . when this scraping around for money lets up , I hope it will get to be what I want . " " Look here , " interrupted Miltiades , " do you imagine this money drain will ever be over when you are starting a restaurant , a rooming house , a swimming pool , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . do n't you know it will be always nip and tuck whether you can keep the church going or not ? " " It will do a lot of good , " said Jerry beginning an uncertaindefense of his work , " it will be a modern community center . . . and a church . "   " Well , I do n't know whether you are getting what you want or not ; I do n't think you are ; but I do know I 'm not getting what I want . Now the only reason I traded my idea of a church for Blankenship 's idea of a church was for your benefit . And if it does n't benefit you ; if neither one of us is getting what he wants . . . I 'm out . That 's what I stopped by to tell you . " The nephew looked at his uncle with sharp concern . " My goodness , Uncle Milt . . . do n't think of such a thing . Why , the Doctor . . . what is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn it , a church ! A church to be buried in , a reverent place where there will be music and solemnity and beauty . I do n't want to spend the first three hundred years after my death in a damned hotel and amusement hall . I do n't like hotels ; I do n't like amusement halls . I do n't want boys whooping and running over my grave ! The more I think of it , the more outrageous it is in Blankenship to insist ... " " Wait ! Wait ! " begged Jerry . " Let me show you something . Dr. Blankenship said if you ever appeared dissatisfied with your donation , would I please show you this . " The Colonel watched Jerry as he went to the wall of the anteroom and pushed back a panel . It was a panel of some size , and as it slid back the Colonel saw a plaster of Paris model of a sarcophagus covered with a carved Confederate flag . Above it arose a segment of a blue vault set with four gold stars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : COLONEL MILTIADES VAIDEN , C.S.A.COMMANDER OF FOURTH ALABAMA VOLUNTEERS SOLDIER * MERCHANT * BANKER * PATRIOT " He told me to tell you this would give you an idea of the way it would look , " explained Jerry in a lowered voice . As he said this the two men heard a little gasp behindP133them . They turned and saw Marsan apparently on the verge of toppling over on the floor . Jerry jumped for her . " What 's the matter ? What 's wrong , Marsan ? " The girl clung to Jerry 's arm , still staring at the model inside the wall . She quavered out : " Oh ! Oh ! Daddy ! " and suddenly began weeping . The two men cuddled her , held her up , got her to a chair . She appeared on the brink of fainting . " Why , Marsan , darling . . . Jerry , get some water ... . What 's the matter , honey ? " The girl drew a long breath and stretched her eyes open . " How came such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " explained Jerry with a dipper , " you know your father expects finally to lie ... " " A long time off . . . a long time off , " assured Miltiades , patting and rubbing her hands . " Ye-es . . . I knew that . . . I . . . I do n't know why it ... it tears me up so . . . . " And she tried to repress her weeping , swallowing her sobs and wiping her eyes with a wisp of lace.  |p134WHEN  Jerry Catlin saw the Vaidens off in their automobile , another car , a small shabby rattling machine , came up the street from the direction of town . Through the dirt and flickering reflections on its windshield Jerry caught glimpses of the driver , a girl , whom he knew to be Aurelia Swartout . The assistant minister felt a lift of spirits as he awaited her on the curb . He had hardly known it , but he had been uneasy lest she should not come and practise on the organ that afternoon . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and opened the door of her rickety car , but she remained motionless , looking at him with an odd whitened face . " You were just seeing some friend off , " she said with a faint smile . " It was Marsan and the Colonel , " said Jerry , " come on in and play for me . " " Did n't she play for you ? " " Who ? " " Why , Miss Marsan . " Jerry looked to see if she were jesting . " Marsan play a pipe organ ? " He began to laugh . " Maybe she does , " said Aurelia with prickles in her even voice . " Did you ask her to ? " " There was no use in asking her . . . I know she ca n't . " " What was she doing in the church ? " " Nothing at all . . . sitting down . . . she was with her father , who came to see me . " Miss Swartout smiled .   " I do n't see how it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " " Why , he was , he and I helped Marsan into the car . " " Just then ? " " Certainly . . . as you drove up . " Miss Swartout sat looking at Jerry with a faint odd smile on her blonde face . " You 're a funny man . . . just say Marsan 's father was with her . " Jerry was bewildered . " I do n't see what you 're driving at , Miss Swartout . Maybeyou did n't see the Colonel , what difference would it make ? If he really was n't here , what object would I have in saying he was here ? " " You and Marsan were there together . " " What if we were ? You and I are here together . Besides that , she 's my first cousin . " The organist moved to get out of her car . " I know that , of course , I was just teasing . I saw Colonel Vaiden . " " Well . . . come on in and play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " No , I did n't mean to practise today . I just came by for some music . I was on my way to give a lesson to the Dodds girl . " " I 'm sorry ; I wanted to hear you play ; I 've had a mechanicalday . " The two walked into the bleak dusty church with its depressingbenches and stiff dark choir stalls . As Aurelia went around to get her music she said in a casual voice : " Mrs. Sydna Vaiden is no kin to you , is she ? " " My aunt by marriage . " " No blood kin . " " No . . . just that . " There was a pause ; then , as Aurelia picked up and arranged her music sheets , she said in a monotone : " You are in love with her , are n't you ... Sydna Vaiden ? "   Jerry was shocked and offended . " What is the matter with you , Miss Swartout ? Why do you make such  --  such unwholesome suggestions ? " The organist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The first time I ever played for you , Sydna Vaiden came in and began talking to you . Neither of you ever knew I was playing or when I quit playing . I could see you in the mirror . But that did n't surprise me . She never listens to music anyway . I thought maybe you were like her , since you belonged to the same family . But afterwards I found out that you do listen to music very closely . . . a certain sort of music . . . so then I knew you were in love with her . " Jerry stared at this remarkable deduction which had hit on the exact opposite of the truth . " Such an amazing chain of reasoning , Miss Swartout ! " He broke out laughing . He was half minded to tell her the odd truth that he had been hurt and depressed in a way because he had discovered in that first meeting with Sydna that he no longer loved her . It really was a strange hurt , and yet it was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she had been piqued that he and Sydna had talked instead of listening to her practice . She had saved up her pique all these weeks and finally had brought it down on his head like this . " Well , I have n't misbehaved myself any more , have I ? Since then I 've listened very nicely . You have no more complaintsto make of my deportment , have you ? " " No-o , " admitted the girl beginning to smile herself , " but I was right about Sydna Vaiden , was n't I ? " " Not in the least . " " Oh , by the way , my mother said tell you Junior Petman got more words than all the grown-up persons put together ... how do you explain that ? " " Listen . . . sit down . . . now , for pity 's sake , tell me whatP137you people are talking about . . . got more words . . . how got more words ? " " There was a party , and we had a contest to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letters in the word ' morningglory . ' Well , the rest of us studied and studied , but Junior wrote for four or five minutes and quit . His mother said , Junior , ca n't you think of any more ? ' and he said , ' I 've got ' em all . ' " Aurelia came to a little pause , looking oddly at the assistant minister in the bleak church . " Had he ? " " Yes , he had . I suppose he had . There were some words we did n't know . We looked them up in the dictionary , and they were words all right . He had eight more than the next best list . " Jerry looked at the girl with astonished eyes . " That did n't really happen ? " " It did . I was there . He beat me by thirteen . " " Did he say . . . how he did it ? " " Oh yes , he said Luggy called the words over to him . " " M  --  huh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . and your mother wants me to explain that ? " " She 's very keen for you to . " " She has a lot of confidence in me ? " " She has n't any at all . She 's for Junior . She hopes he 'll stump you . " Miss Swartout began to laugh again . " Well , there you are , " said Jerry , enlightened , " so it is now my move . Tell her that Junior is telepathic . That he had telepathic access to the minds of all the persons at the party , so he just wrote out what everybody knew , right off , like that . Luggy , of course , is an illusion , it is merely the form which his telepathic insight assumes . By the way , that last is quite sensible . If a child received its communications in the form of words , it would almost automatically visualize a body to speak the words . . . that 's really an idea , Aurelia . " " Yes , but it had words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry considered another moment .   " Tell her the Petman child is a psychic . That it had seen the words in newspapers , dictionaries , anywhere , and that it has a photographic and instantaneous memory . " Aurelia nodded , impressed . " Why , that makes it very simple . He got his words just like the rest of us got ours , only he was better at it than we were . " " Why , yes , I suppose it does , " admitted Jerry , a little disappointed himself that the marvel and his explanation of it had sifted down to anything so usual as that . " You can tell your mother that . " " I do n't think she will like it much , " said Aurelia . " I 'll go over and tell it to her myself , " said Jerry . " We-ell . . . that might help , " agreed Aurelia reluctantly . " You pick me up on your way back , after you give theDodds girl her music lesson , " planned Jerry . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today . " " Now , look here , I 'm not going to bring you back home , " warned Aurelia . " No , I 'll take a bus . " " Well . . . all right . . . let 's start . " " But you have to give the Dodds girl her music lesson ? " Aurelia glanced at her wrist watch . " It 's too late now . . . . I do n't see why Mother bothers her head about such things , do you ? " " Well , it 's a human frailty to seek after wonders , " said Jerry more thoughtfully , " and if there should be a reality back of the little boy 's illusions , it would exist outside the metaphysics of the church , and it would create a confusion and necessitate a certain rearrangement of orthodox religion . " Aurelia looked at her companion as they went to the car . " The idea of Mother thinking of that ! " " No , she does n't think of it , she feels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the subtlest and most glorified philosophies attainable by the human intellect lie nascent in the humblest minds . The bushman wondering at the Australian stars at night is an embryonic Kepler or Einstein . The savage fatherP139enduring the ordinary hardships of everyday life for his mate and children is a far-off Christ upon a cross . " The organist became quiet and directed her car through Courthouse Square and along the Sheffield road as the sun spread its silent conflagration in the West . From the brow of the river hill the two could see a long lane of the color repeated in the river with trees and the spindling bridge etched against it . " I do n't know what people will say about you driving home with me , " said the girl , glancing at the sky and then back at the road . " Nothing , " opined Jerry . " M  --  m , you do n't know Florence women . . . if a man goes out and educates himself , people say that 's fine ; but if a girl does the same thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know . . . not the sort of a girl that other girls chum with . . . or men go with . " Jerry looked at her . " Are you lonely , Miss Swartout ? " " No-o ... I play . " " Have you no men friends ? " " There 's a boy named Tony Vicelli who wants to marry me , " she said with brooding frankness . " What does he do ? " " Work for Papa . " " What does your father do ? " " Builds houses . " " Contractor ? " " A kind of a contractor . " She spoke with reluctance and obvious distaste , and Jerry abandoned the point . When the motor crossed the bridge , Aurelia asked if they ' should go through Mr. Tergune 's subdivision , it was a very pretty drive . Jerry agreed to the extended drive provided the girl would let him fill the car with gas in Sheffield . Aurelia refused this ; she said she often drove that way by herself , and it was nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was talking about if she wanted to say something . " Are you going to want to say anything ? " asked Jerry in an effort to lighten the conversation . " Talk does n't keep folks from being lonely , " said Aurelia , " it 's the feeling that you will be understood no matter whether you talk or not . " She thought a moment then gave a brief laugh . " You know they do n't know a motet from a pavane ; they could n't tell a Scottish snap from an Italian cadence . " Jerry gathered that she referred to the other women , who thought her a little queer . Before the car had gone far , night fell , and the motorists moved along wide empty boulevards , passing through the ornamental and solitary entrances of the various subdivisions . These ornate entrances were symbols of the boom itself ; newcomers hurrying to buy , hurrying to sell ; every man proclaiming the mighty future of Florence and wondering uneasilyand subconsciously how long he dared hold his belongingsto squeeze the last cent out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At the Southern end of their drive they moved along a narrower , but still a paved road sentineled with the black shapes of cottages . Aurelia broke her silence : " This is Jericho . " The assistant minister looked around in the darkness with interest . " Mr. Petman 's subdivision for colored people ? " " Yes ; my father is building these houses . " Jerry was surprised . " Well , it 's about the only subdivision under way . . . your father must be doing pretty well . " Aurelia drove a space and then said in a flat voice : " My father 's a fool . " Jerry opened his mouth to remonstrate when the girl gasped out :   " Look ! Look ! Oh , my goodness , it 's one of Papa 's houses on fire ! " The light she saw lay on their left . Jerry could see flames leaping up at some indeterminate distance . Aurelia veered her car and set out toward the light . " Oh , if it 's one of Papa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet ... the main is laid but it is n't connected . We 'll never put it out ! " " We can get back to town and send a chemical engine , " hurried Jerry . Miss Swartout drove faster when Jerry ejaculated : " Why , that 's not a house ! " The girl slowed down her motor . " Why , it is n't , it 's a cross ! " Through some caution she switched off her lights and moved at a slow pace toward the queer illumination . It defined itself as a tall cross with the angles somewhat blurred by the flames . Around it marched a line of white-sheeted figures . The girl looked at the scene fixedly . " Do you suppose , " she began , " that they mean they wo n't let the niggers move in here ? " " Why , no-o , they ca n't mean that , " comforted Jerry in an uncertain voice ; " the plans of this negro subdivision were approved by the building Committee of the Realtors ' Association . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of Mr. Petman 's subdivision . There are no houses anywhere around . " Aurelia was reassured . She sat watching the red-lighted elieets moving around the flaming cross . " What are they doing that for ? " she asked finally . " Would you really like to know ? " " Yes . . . what ? " " Right at this moment it is on account of those six negroes . The boom almost killed Bodine 's organization , because it gave people something to think about and gamble on . Before the boom men joined this society and marched around bonfiresbecause their lives were humdrum and unimportant .   Doings such as these , masking themselves , riding up and down the countryside on secret political missions , provided an escape from , say , selling hardware all day long , or filling teeth . And then for them to think that somehow or other they were saving their country by such antics . . . it was a bargain at the price . " Miss Swartout broke out laughing . " It 's the South @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would n't say that , " objected Jerry , " because the term is a bit out of date . "  |p143BY  A somewhat odd coincidence , just before Jerry Catlin and Miss Swartout reached Carver 's Lane they passed a building known as Benevolence Hall . It was a structure owned by the negroes . On this night it was lighted up , and through its windows they could see figures wearing the cheap , brightly colored regalia of the negro society of Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia . The two stopped and watched the performance for a while , laughing at the way the black people imagined kings and princes deported themselves ; then they drove on to Aurelia 's home . Jerry 's actual visit in the Swartout cottage was not particularly noteworthy save for his meeting with Tony Vicelli , Aurelia 's lover , and a completely unexpected dona-t ion to the cathedral from Mr. Swartout . Mr. Swartout was a small man with a red lumpy face and blue eyes that were always stretched wide . When Aurelia introduced him to Jerry , Mr. Swartout was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once talking about the foundations of the new cathedral , giving details which Jerry himself had never observed . From this topic he led , or rather leaped , for his conversation was disconnected , to the subject of Aurelia 's piano . " Come into the parlor , " he invited , " and have a look at it ... wonderful cabinet work , Doctor . . . you ca n't tell where the joints are . . . and Minnie paid for it with her music lessons . " " Minnie ? " " Aurely , " corrected little old Mrs. Swartout quickly . Jerry went in to see the workmanship of the piano .   The daughter stood helpless in the bare parlor while her father exhibited the undisputed workmanship on the piano . As a relief Jerry mentioned seeing the houses Mr. Swartout had built in Jericho . " You did ! " ejaculated the little man , very pleased , " and did you take the trouble to go in one of ' em and see how it was built ? " " No , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should have , " exclaimed the little man , with wide enthusiastic blue eyes , " every stick in them houses is clear lumber , not a foot of sap . The sash weights have guides , they do n't hang loose and get caught . The hardware in them houses would do for your uncle 's manor , Dr. Catlin . . . all the best , first class . . . and built right . " " I wonder you could afford to do it ? " " It 's a pleasure to do it . I was a carpenter before the boom , Dr. Catlin , and I worked for other contractors , and the way they scamped their material and their work made me sick . I thought to myself , If I ever get a chance I 'll turn out work that is work . ' Then , as I say , along come the boom , and Marvin Petman , who is a kind of partner of mine , said to me , Swartout , why do n't you go into the contracting game and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Who would contract with me ? ' And he said , Why , I would , you 're a good workman and an honest man . ' And I said , I have n't the money to start . ' And Petman laughed and said , If nobodystarted till they had the money to start , they would n't be any startin ' done . Go to the banks , ' he said . " Well , we talked it over about twice more , when I took him up . Petman introduced me to his bank , the Merchants and Planters , right over there in Sheffield , and here I am , a contractor . . . . That foundation you are putting under the cathedral , Dr. Catlin , sure is a pretty piece of stone work ... . What do you do over there ? " " Oh , Papa , Dr. Catlin is n't interested in what he 's doing , " pleaded Aurelia a little irrationally . " Bound to be , or he would n't do it , Minnie . "   " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Sunday schools , mainly . " " Collecting money ? " " Yes , to build the church . " " I suppose you 'd take it from just anywhere you could , would n't you ? . . . It 's a good cause . " " Naturally , " laughed Jerry . " I do n't believe I ever heard of a church turning down a contribution . " Mr. Swartout stood a moment longer with his hands in his pockets . " Well . . . make yourself at home , " he invited , turned , and went out into the hallway again and closed the parlor door softly behind him . Aurelia looked at Jerry with a flushed face and bright embarrassed eyes . Suddenly she began laughing . " You must excuse him . . . that 's his technique . " " Technique ? " " To arrange privacy for me and my callers . " Jerry smiled , amused by the father and not displeased at the result of his efforts . He glanced at the closed door and then at an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parlor light the blossom of a climbing rose with the glint of dew on its petals . The almost antiseptic cleanness of the bare room seemed to take on the odor of the rose , although it was improbable that he actually smelled it . Jerry did , after all , take an interest in the piano . He wanted to know why Aurelia had installed a grand piano in the Cot-t age . " I thought at one time I was going to be a concert pianist ... my teacher told me I could . " Jerry was surprised . " You must be extremely good . " " I do n't know . . . . He was a Southern teacher . . . Josefy , in Birmingham . . . he thought I would get a scholarship in Chicago , but I did n't . In fact , I did n't even get under Straussman . . . I had to study with his assistant , Mr. N1 entierre . "   Jerry divined then the cause of the continual flavor of pathos about Miss Swartout . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had far more ability than was requiredat a casual musical in Florence . She had the nerves of an artist ; talk disturbed her when she was playing . Indeed . her work was most worthy to be listened to . . . free . But in ordinary social gatherings no one listened to music . Her extra skill in her work was of little advantage to her in attracting pupils , because the children in Florence wanted to learn to play popular tunes at once , and Miss Swartout did not teach popular tunes , nor , indeed , any tune , at once . Jerry wondered if Miss Swartout was so professional that he dare not ask her to play for him . He was about to risk the point when he heard Mr. Swartout in the hallwayinviting someone to walk into the parlor , saying that Minnie and a doctor friend of hers would be glad to see the newcomer . Whoever it was declined the invitation in a low voice . He had just come over , he said , to ask Mr. Swartout on what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Meggs house , " returned the contractor heartily . " Wo n't you set a while , Tony ? " " No  --  no , " said Tony in a gray voice , " I 'll be going back to my boarding place . " Jerry , recalling his own boyhood and Sydna , knew all the perturbations of Tony 's heart , and he was very sorry he had disturbed the young man 's call . Twenty minutes later , when the assistant minister left the home in Carver 's Lane , the knotty little contractor walked with him to the gate and in parting , put a package into his hands . " Something to go on the cathedral , " he said . " I 'm not religious myself , but I believe in churches . I 've thought I 'd lie to build a church myself , sometime , when I 'm old , just spend my days working on a church . " In Jerry 's astonished hands was a roll of bills of small denominations . P147Aurelia , who was driving Jerry to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . Papa ... " and became silent . When the two were in the car together , Jerry held the money irresolutely in his hands , disturbed at his companion 's gasp . He was considering a diplomatic way to return it when an extraordinary sight arrested both their eyes . A constellation of lanterns was moving down Carver 's Lane from Benevolence Hall to Grey Mule Hill . These lanterns lighted one of the most chromatic and tatterdemalion pageants that Jerry had ever seen . They were the Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia on their way home . They sang , swayed , and laughed . Black men and women shuffled along in pairs arrayed in tinsel and bright cheap rayon . When the procession passed the car they becamedignified before the white onlookers . Those who knew the motorists called out in their mellow voices : " Hidy , Miss Rellie ! Hidy , Mistuh Je'y ! Nice night we 're Navin ' . " To which the white couple called back courteous replies , keeping their amusement out of their voices as best they could . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , very black woman , wearing a yellow and green robe with a crimson stole arching out and over a vast bosom , and crowned with a gilt uncl glass tiara . She stopped before the car and brought to a stand her escort , a short , stumpy black man . " Well , Mist ' Je'y , I heard you come home . I heard my niece say she seed you . " " Who is your niece ? " asked Jerry with a Southerner 's dislike for admitting that he does not remember his negro friends . " Rose , " said the huge woman , so mellowly that it was music , " that high yellow gal what took you in de hotel . " Miss Swartout saw Jerry 's predicament and prompted in low tone :  | " That 's Pammy Lee . " The bulky negress caught this and burst out : " Shoo , Mist ' Je'y knows me ! " " Of course I do , " cried Jerry , amazed at such a bulk substitutedfor the leggy , corkscrew-headed Pammy Lee whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ How 're you getting on ? " inquired Jerry heartily . " Oh , fine . . . jess fine . . . one o ' my husban 's got killed in de wah , an ' I jess come into my ' surance money . " " You do n't mean it ! " cried Jerry in a congratulatory tone . " Yes suh , I means hit . De good Lawd let me come into my own at las ' , and I says , Good-bye , pot , good-bye , fryin ' pan , Pammy Lee has come into huh own at las ' . ' " " I certainly congratulate you , " said Jerry very sincerely . " Thank you , Mist ' Je'y , thank you ve'y much . I come putty neah puttin ' in my claim fuh anothah one o ' my husban 's who got killed in de wa ' , but Mistuh Jeffe'son Ashton , who runs my insu'ance business fuh me , he say , No , I would n't do hit , Pammy Lee . ' Vide up yo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a claim on Kinchus ' dat was my othah husban 's name , fo ' he got killed ; he say , You got mo 'n you can spen ' all yo ' life long already , Pammy Lee . ' " Miss Swartout began to laugh irresistibly . " Get into the back seat , Pammy Lee , drive to the bus station with me , and I 'll take you back home . I do n't like to drive by myself after dark . " " All right , yessum . . . still , I du n no . . . " She turned to her escort in a red calico surplice . " What you say ' bout dat , Ludus ? " " Sho ! Sho ! Don ' stan ' back on me , " urged Ludus goodnaturedly . He took her great black arm and moved her with a droll sort of bow toward the car . Pammy Lee hung back . " I sho ' don ' know whethuh to go aw not . Heah I is in muh robe , runnin ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Toss a nickel , " laughed Jerry , " that will decide it withoutprejudice . " Ludus produced a coin , called out , " Haids she stay , tails she go , " and tossed it . He caught it in the palm of his hand and leaned toward the headlight of the car . As he did so , Jerry saw the outline of a long slender somethingunder his robe and at the bottom caught the glint of a gun barrel . It was as shocking as if the genial Ludus had transformed himself into a werewolf . Jerry looked fixedly at Ludus , then began scrutinizing all the garish robes that passed him . Under most of the robes worn by the men , he thought he detected the stiffness of guns . The assistant minister hardly knew what to think or do . 1 f he reported this he might be doing the black folk a serious wrong . On the other hand , it might very well be that the negroesused the guns quite innocently in some of their ceremonies . Ludus looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yellowish palm : " Raids , she stay wid me. "  | THE guns which Jerry Catlin had glimpsed under the robes of the Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia were entirely real , although Jerry had been not absolutely certain about it . They had even caused a sharp division of opinion among the Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia . Bishop Sinton , Grand Exalted Potentate , with a triple crown on his head had spoken against the men of Grey Mule Hill arming themselves . He said to his lodge , " You are trudging in a land of sorrow toward a goal which you yourselves can not see and will never see . The black people of the South have a patience under calamity , an endurance of wrong and injustice such as no other race of men has ever known . " That is your strength , brothers and sisters , endurance , patience , and love , not rifles . The white people have more rifles than you have . They encompass you about like a cloud ; their spears shine on a thousand hills . Yea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down your children without cause or warrant . But the Lord will protect and comfort us , and the Lord will repay . " He went on in the same strain to point out how much better off were his hearers than their grandfathers who were in chains , and their fathers who could not enter a court to sue a white man but who could only be sued ; how much better off they were than their older brothers , who were hanged and burned when certain charges were brought against them without a thought of truth or justice . " Today , " he concluded , " men and boys of our color are to have their trial . Be patient , my people , put away your guns . Today we have our trial ; tomorrow we have justice . " P151There was a negro doctor who belonged to the society , a tall yellow man named Greenup . Not more than fifty or a hundred white persons in Florence knew Greenup existed . 1 le remained as closely as possible in the negro settlement in East Florence , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tuscumbia . He bought his groceries from negro stores in East Florence , and purchased clothes for himself and family from negro tailors and modistes in Birmingham . At all the meetings of the Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia he wore a green silk robe slashed with white and scarlet , and a double crown . He was a somber , serious man , continually in mind of the fact that he was barred from the County Medical Association ; that no white doctor would administer ether when he operated on his patients , and that the Florence hospital was not open to him . He read his medicaljournals with great attention , trying to make up in this manner what he missed in the ordinary doctors ' consultations . He had two friends , negro doctors in Birmingham , whom he went to see when he bought his clothing . Greenup was highly influential among the negroes of the three adjoining towns , and he strongly favored the Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia possessing guns and ammunition . The difference which thus broke out between Bishop Sinton and Dr. Greenup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely in earnest . The two had always worked together . They had planned and introduced into the ' black settlements negro dolls with curly black hair to be given to little negro girls instead of the usual blonde dolls . They introduced especial books into the negro public schoolsit I- stories of negro social leaders , negro warriors , negro poets , negro scientists . All their efforts were directed toward a building up of negro pride of race . The cheap absurd costumes all of them wore were a childish step in that direction , whose emptiness both the leaders understood . But the two men differed with each other on the matter of guns.  | When the meeting had been dismissed and the members shuffled home in their brummagem , the debate between the two men persisted among their followers . " Brothah Greenup sho ' is a man , " said Ludus . " Brothah Sinton sho ' has got de Lawd on his side , " said Pammy Lee . " Brothah Greenup , he quote scripture , too ; he say , I come not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Chris ' let de chillun ob dis worl ' crucify He . " The two fantastically clad negroes moved on , fetching up what bits of the scripture they could recall by way of argument . Presently Ludus said in a different tone : " Pammy Lee , gim me ten dollahs out'n all dat money de guv'mint give you . " " Huh , how come dat ? " " Well , it jess lak you pick it up in de road . " " Yeh , pickin ' up ai n't layin ' down . " It was at this moment that the two members of Ethiopian royalty saw the lights of a motor coming and a few moments later met Jerry Catlin and Miss Rellie Swartout . The delight of Pammy Lee was great , not that she cared anything about Jerry himself , but he was a unit of the great white family which placed before her imagination an ideal world of grandeur , nobility , and power . When Miss Rellie invited Pammy Lee to go with her to the bus station , Pammy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not quite do it , and at the toss of a nickel she went on with Ludus to her home . But the bulky black woman paid little more attention to Ludus . She was absorbed in the past ; she recalled her mother , Miss Tony , who once worked for Mr. Augustus Vaiden and Miss Sydna , who once had been Jerry 's sweetheartand who had married Colonel Milt . The past of her pantheon moved before her . And she remembered one night , how Jerry , after kissing Miss Sydna , had taken her , Pammy Lee , a leggy screw-haired black girl , among the box hedges . That young Jerry seemedP153t o her to bear no relation whatever to the grave man she had just seen in the car , and that vanished , leggy Pammy Lee who was so awkwardly and incidentally seduced bore no relation whatever to herself . That misstep was lost in the pensive perspective of Time . Ludus was saying : " Looky heah , Pammy Lee , why don ' you gim me a little o ' dat money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much money did you git , nohow ? " Pammy Lee did not want to be disturbed in her reverie . " Hush , Ludus , hush yo ' mouf . " " How much ' surance you git frum de guv'mint ? " " I nevah count hit . " " Co'se you did n't , you could n't , but Mistah Ashton , he count hit . " " Oh , Ludus , my min 's on othah things . " " Yeh , yo mill ' gits on othah things when dat ' surance money comes up , " said Ludus bitterly . Pammy Lee made no reply , and the two left the primary clay road that meandered down the hill and took the path t o Pammy Lee 's cabin . Resentment filled Ludus at the way Pammy Lee was acting . To the negro man Pammy Lee 's insurance money appeared a trove which she had stumbled upon by the sheerest accident . He had the annoyed feeling that comes over a personwhen his companion stoops and picks up a coin that , both of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should win a fortune never seems fair to the person who does not stoop . " Look here , Pammy Lee , " said Ludus in a hard voice , " is you or ai n't you gwi ' give me some o ' dat ' surance money ? " " You fool niggah , I ai n't . " " Is you hit on you now ? " Pammy Lee tried to see his face in the lantern light . " Ludus , I ai n't sayin ' nothin " tall ' bout dat money . " " Well , I see if you is got hit on you . " The queer parti-colored figure put down the lantern , caught Pammy Lee 's great arm , and with the other hand began to feel her enormous thighs to see what she had hidden in her stockings . Pammy Lee flung the negro from her . " You fool man ! " she cried , " quit feelin ' o ' my laigs ! " Ludus ' gun dropped to the ground . He rushed back at her unencumbered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lee screamed . The grotesquely colored figures struggled in the lantern light . The huge negress was almost as strong as the man . She began sweating and became so slippery he could not hold her at all . She shrieked and flung him from her . He fell heavily to the ground , his hands full of bright rags torn from her regalia . Lying beside him , Ludus saw his gun in the lantern light . He seized it and leaped up again . " You damn stingy black slut , " he yelled , " gittin ' money off'n daid men ! " The huge half-naked black woman threw up her ponderousarms and turned for her cabin , screaming : " Ludus ! Do n't kill me , Ludus ! Do n't kill me ! " when he fired both barrels . From all over Grey Mule Hill came shouts and cries . " Ludus shoot Pammy Lee ! " " Oh God , Ludus done shoot Pammy Lee ! " " Run fuh de doctah ; Pammy Lee got de money to pay ! " Lanterns converged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another voice called out in a gray tone : " You-all neen sen ' fuh no doctah . De Lawd drag a fo'chun in Pammy Lee 's lap , but He don " low huh to spen ' hit ... . Pammy Lee 's daid . " The Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia gathered around to stare at the tragedy . A woman started a high shrill chanting ; others joined in . As they went , they composed lines on the deep irony of Pammy Lee 's death . Six negro men in the garb of antique jesters bore the body inside the cabin.  |p155THE  shooting of Pammy Lee came to the ears of the Reverend Jerry Catlin as he was going for private morning prayers in the old Methodist Church . The assistant minister was shocked . The thought of the black , the ponderous , the comfortable Pammy Lee being dead distracted his devotions . Jerry went to pray each morning by the choir stalls on t he left side of the church and at a point nearest the manuals of the organ . He chose this position @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer in the old church . It had a pulpit but no altar , a collection box but no chapels . I t. had no definite place to keep the sacraments and no definitesacraments . Old Sarah , Dr. Blankenship 's cook , baked t he little cakes out of flour and made the sacramental wine out of blackberries until a meeting of the stewards decided t hey would use grape juice instead . Amid this lack of focus for spiritual works , and disturbed by the death of an old acquaintance , and excited about the nix negro criminals whose trial would begin that day , Jerry really had difficulty in keeping his mind on his prayers . In such moments of distraction Jerry had found it helpful to reach in his pocket and finger a coin as a sort of digital aid to prayer , but on this morning his hands touched a nt range roll of paper money . Then he remembered Mr. Swartout'ssurprising gift of the night before . He had not as yet entered it in the church ledger as a donation . This was really important @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went into the anteroom which served as the church 's of lice , and attended to it . As he entered the item , he thought of the six negro boys in jail.  | As a matter of fact , all Florence buzzed with excitement over the imminent trial . A great number of Southern people did not believe the trial would ever come off . They thought the black boys would be taken from the officers between the jail and the courthouse . Others thought a mob would rise up spontaneously in the courtroom itself . The men who augured this outcome did so with a hidden pride in belonging to a country so fiery . However , at about nine o'clock in the morning the negroes were transported to the place of their trial . Deputy Sheriff Northrup had old Dr. Southwick come to the jail in his car as if on a medical mission . He bundled the negroes into this and shot them up the alley and into the courtroom before anybody could say Jack Robinson . As a final precaution against violence , Sheriff O'Brien stationed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these guards searched everyone entering the place for firearms . There were twenty-seven automatics and revolvers removed from the spectators by eleven o'clock that morning . One of the guards finally declared that he believed the guns were tickets and he would refuse to admit anybody without one . At twelve o'clock sharp , the clerk of the court called out , " Oh yes ! Oh yes ! The court is now open ! " The jammed room leaned forward as the sheriff , five constables , and eight policemen entered the side door near the Judge 's bench in a cordon around the six negro boys . All of them took seats inside the rail , the officers negligently scanning the crowd with their pistols ready at hand . After the manner of officers , they did not appear to expect trouble . The clerk of the court arose and read each one of the six warrants , all identical except for the names in them . Each defendant and all the defendants were charged separately and jointly with misusing , criminally assaulting , raping , knowing by force @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent to misuse , assaulting with intent to criminallyP157know by force and violence , one Mary Roe , a white girl , at a certain place on a certain day of a certain month of a certain year against the peace and dignity of the State of Alabama . There came a buzzing , a kind of growling , over the courtroomat the endless repetition of these legal obscenities . Judge Wilson tapped with his gavel and called out in a sharp voice that the courtroom would be cleared instantly if all undue noises did not cease . A shushing arose from various parts of the room from people who wanted to hear the trial even if they had to listen quietly to such a wrath-provoking indictment . In the silence which this created Judge Wilson asked : " Are the prisoners ready for trial ? " As if in answer to this question , a small wizened , middleagedman with a long nose arose and said : " Your Honor , may I speak a word ? " Judge Wilson looked around , and a quiver of apprehension ran over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , that 's Sandusky ! " . . . " Sandusky 's for the defense ! " . . . " Damn shyster will do anything for money ! " .. " Some big-hearted man ought to shoot Sandusky ! " The court tapped again , more strongly than ever , and again threatened expulsion unless the strictest order were preserved . Then the Judge recognized Mr. Sandusky . " I was going to say , your Honor , that the present trial promises to be a long and arduous one . I myself am defendingclient called Ludus , a colored man charged with murder . ' he warrant reads , One Ludus Meggs charged with shooting end killing a negro woman named Pammy Lee Sparkman is a street fight on Grey Mule Hill . ' " Now , your Honor , I am aware that in a grave cause such ax the present one , the court can not be annoyed with legal trifles . My client Ludus shot this woman in the midst of a fist tight between the two . That we admit . A gun happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the scuffle . The woman , Pammy Lee Sparkman , was a huge powerful woman ,   your Honor , and she flung my client with great force on his head and shoulders . He even struck the gun itself and was badly bruised . He has black spots on him , your Honor , from the fall . . . in fact , he is black all over . Unrestrained laughter in the courtroom which the Judge permitted . " Ludus , my client , then , in his pain and rage , seized the gun , leaped up , and shot the black woman who had assaulted him . When this case finally appears for trial , your Honor , it is my intention to enter a plea of self-defense . At the very worst , nothing more can be made out of it than a case of manslaughter , although in this instance the slaughtered person happens to be a woman . More laughter . " As Ludus can not make a bond of more than fifty dollars and as he made no effort whatever to escape , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him this morning , and as the constable did not feel it was necessary or safe to bring him here in court today for reasons which are unnecessary to mention , I therefore suggest that you set the prisoner 's bond at fifty dollars or release him on his own recognizance until he is indicted by the grand jury at the next term of court . " Mr. Sandusky sat down . Judge Wilson directed the clerk of the court to release Ludus Meggs without bond and on his own recognizance , pending investigation of his case by the next grand jury , and for the order to be effective at once . Mr. Sandusky then thanked the Judge and walked out of the side door , to the intense relief of the audience . The court then returned to the case of the six rapists , and the trial continued . The six negro boys in question sat in the dock lined up according to size , like the pipes of a syrinx . The smallest prisonerwas almost white . He wore dirty knickerbockers , and he could just touch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet . The next boy was almost black , wore trousers that had been cut down from some man 's garment , and they fitted him loosely like two sacks joined in the middle . The otherP159four negroes ranged up to a big strapping black boy , as large as an ordinary man . Four of the prisoners who were really black wore the gray pinched look of negroes who are sick or badly frightened . The small light yellow boy was clayey , and he kept batting his black eyes and looking at the field of white faces which began close to him and stretched away in an upward incline until it reached the furthest walls . These innumerable pale faces gazed fixedly on him and his five companions . The child heard a man on the second row whisper to a seat mate , " They 'll have to tie weights to that little one 's feet to break his neck . " The little yellow boy looked down at his feet with which he had been trying to reach the floor and hitched his heels self-consciously on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the attorney appointed by the court to defend the negroes , arose and said the defendants were ready for trial . The state 's attorney , a lawyer by the name of Cathey , asked the permission of the court to withhold the actual appearance of the principal witness on the stand , that is , MaryRoe , but to be allowed to introduce a transcript of the interrogatoriesput to her by Sheriff O'Brien and the girl 's answers Chereto . Mr. Ashton objected at once on the score that such testimonywas not the best evidence , also that written interrogationswere not subject to the probe of cross-questions ; also that it denied the defendants the right guaranteed them by law , of facing their accuser . Mr. Cathey , for the state , looked at Mr. Ashton with a faint disparaging smile . " Your Honor , " he began , " I am aware of the right ofe attorney of the defense to probe the truth of the accusations brought against his clients by cross-questioning the witnesses for the state . I am also aware of Mr. Greenleaf 's rule @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a right to face their accuser in open court , not only to deny what has been charged against them , but so that the court itself , by the cast of their faces , by the expression of their eyes , your Honor , those windows of the soul , may determinewhich party is in the right and which in the wrong . " But . . . but , your Honor , may I inquire of the honorable attorney for the defense if he proposes to invoke these historic rights in behalf of six slimy , lecherous , lustful , brutal black rake-hells ; animal in form but devils in constitution , the foulest despoilers of the fairest flower that blooms in the hearts of men , a woman 's virtue ? " And will the honorable attorney for the defense stoop to ask that the woman herself appear before the gaze of half the county and not only admit a cruel , repulsive , and obscene misuse , more terrible than death , but to describe it , go into the grisly , greasy , and unthinkable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a criminal code ? " There is another code , your Honor , I have heard old men say , another code in the South , higher than the criminal code , and that is the code of Honor , the code that requires the protection of the sensibilities of its women . Will the attorney for the defense appeal from that higher to that lower code ? " He says that under the rules of evidence the defendants have that right ; I say that in the flames of their lust , which God , even among the lower animals , tempers to the use of love , I say they have burned up that right ! " At this moment there sit the six , in the prisoners ' bar , on sufferance most fragile and most extreme . Your Honor , can you imagine what this crowded courtroom would do if the pale and bleeding victim of their attack were presented to their eyes as . . . the best evidence ? " Christ in heaven , do you imagine your gavel , your officers set about with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the Angel with the Flaming Sword whom God set guarding Eden could withstand the impetuous fury of their wrath ? " Uproar from the audience drowned his last period ; men howled , stamped their feet , leaned forward with clenched fists . The officers leaped up with drawn arms and formed aP161line in front of the prisoners ' box . All the officials of the court began shouting for order . Judge Wilson hammered on his desk . Finally a nasal shout penetrated the uproar : " Hey ... let the trial go on . . . let 's hear the other lawyer 's oratory ! " Several voices yelled : " Put that damned Yankee out ! " This diversion , however , eventually quieted the courtroom . Mr. Ashton , with a very pale face , walked over and talked in low tones to the judge . State 's Attorney Cathey joined the wo , and they formed a little group of three talking earnestly together , nodding now and then at the negroes and now and then at a legal paper on the Judge 's desk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Cathey held up his hand lit them backward so that his palm faced the audience while 1w continued talking to the Judge and Mr. Ashton . Silence fell again , and the crowd watched the trio intently . Finally Judge Wilson rapped his gavel and said : " Mr. Ashton withdraws his objection to the absence of the state 's principal witness , but insists on the right to crossamineby writing , as if this were a case in chancery . I have upheld his objection thus modified , and the case will be suspendedawaiting the filing of the cross-examination for the defense . " At that moment a Western Union boy entered the sider of the courtroom and went to the nearest officer . The bailiff pointed out to him Judge Wilson . The youngster took off his blue cap and went up to the bench with his envelopebut kept his eyes fixed on the six black boys in the dock . Two of them were not so old as he . Judge Wilson opened and read the telegram . He frowned , removed his eyeglasses , polished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a nervous finger , and the two men read the telegram together . A reporter for one of the papers arose from the press table , walked up and looked over the shoulders of the lawyers.  | Amazement filled his face , then delight . He made a full-arm gesture at the other reporters at his desk . " My God , boys , " he called in a tone so tense it carried : III over the audience , " Ponniman , the great Phineas Delfa , e Ponniman , has taken this case ! He 'll defend the coons ! l l e 's been retained by the A. B. C. P. ! This  --  is  --  going  --  to  --  he  --  good ! " WHEN HEN the news rolled out of the courthouse and got abroad it seemed hardly credible to the people of Florence that Ponniman would come away down into Alabama merely to defend six little negroes . Phineas Delfase Ponniman , the great Ponniman , knight errant of justice ; war eagle of human rights ; ethical paladin of such deep and world-embracing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , be either what they may ... such a colossus of the law coming to appearin the cause of six little negroes ! From the day this information appeared in the newspapers , the criminal assault case of the six negro boys leaped from merely Southern into national and even international publicity . I t was made . It had arrived . Great Northern journals that were published normally every hour , under this heavy break of Ponniman news , appeared at ten- and fifteen-minute intervals , with flaming electric letters traveling around and around their buildings I keep the public informed what was happening to Ponniman and the six little negroes during those dark and unenlightenedten-minute intervals between editions . These journals dispatched crack reporters and press photographers to the scene of the trial . There they interviewed and photographed , and telegraphed said interviews and photographsto Chicago and New York of the following persons and things , to wit : The six negro boys ; the girl Mary Roe ; Judge Wilson ; Sheriff O'Brien ; Deputy Sheriff Northrup ; the constables ;   the policemen ; the courthouse janitor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deputy sheriff , the constables , the policemen , and the janitor . They reproduced recipes given by Judge Wilson 's cook for baking Southern biscuit and frying Southern batter cakes , and told how many the Judge ate of each a1 a sitting . In these interviews , by the aid and artifice of phonetic spelling they contrived a Southern dialect such as is retailed by Loew 's circuit and manufactured in powerful concentrate in the theater district along Forty-second Street in New York City . In other words , thanks to the impulsive telegram dispatchedby Miss Marsan Vaiden , the Florence rape case had broken into big-time publicity . There was all sorts of talk in Florence as to what would happen to Ponniman when he arrived there . He would be ridden on a rail , tarred and feathered , horsewhipped ; they would make it clear how welcome in Southern courts was a Northern defender of negro rapists . This , however , was a kind of public and collective anger ; individually and privately , everybody in Florence was impatient to see the great Phineas Ponniman . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ papers printed about them , but individually they cared very little , because , after all , nobody read the Northern papers except Northerners . However , the North did not understand this peculiar dual way the South has of regarding them , and all this Southern talk finally invoked a telegram . The telegram originated with the Mayor of New York and was directed to the Mayor of Florence . It read : THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK WISHES TO INFORM HIS HONOR THE MAYOR OF FLORENCE THAT MR . PHINEAS DELFASE PONNIMANAND HIS ASSOCIATES ARE EN ROUTE TO FLORENCE AND WILL INVESTIGATE THE CHARGES MADE AGAINST THE SIX NEGRO PRISONERS NOW IN CUSTODY AT FLORENCE IN THE IN-P165TEREST OF JUSTICE , LAW , AND ORDER ; AND DESIRES THAT YOUR HONOR WILL EXTEND TO MR .

Perhaps in all Florence only Mr. Jefferson Ashton was genuinely disturbed and gloomy over this turn taken by the trial of the six negro boys . Mr. Ashton sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a notarial seal , and a shirt tail full of Alabama Reports . The lively hopes that he had entertained of improving his fortunes and surroundings had vanished utterly . With Phineas Ponniman as a colleague in the rape case , he , JeffersonAshton , would disappear from the picture . His speech of defense , which he had been working on for three nights , would be heard by nobody , much less printed in the papers . because everybody would be waiting for the closing plea of Mr. Ponniman . And presently the defense which Mr. Ashton had been appointedby the court to conduct took on a distinctly reprehensibleaspect . He doubted the integrity of a man who would appear in such a cause . He had been seduced by the too insidious arguments of his fellow townsmen . He tapped the ashes of his cheroot onto a piece of dirty cardboard . He was considering resigning from the case . In the midst of his quandary , the heavy plausible figure of Bodine entered his door . The organizer stood with legs apart , nodding his big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Well , " he said in his portentous voice , " this comes of turning the law loose on a case like this , Ashton . . . anything'sli'ble to happen . . . any God damn thing . " " What has happened ? " " You ask me ? Huh ! If Ponniman ever gets here , do n't you know that girl 's going to be questioned and crossquestioned ? Do you think Ponniman would ease up on a single rule of evidence to spare anybody ? " " Sure I know that . . . what about it ? " " I come in here to ask you what about it . " Ashton bit off the end of his cheroot , worked his lips back and forth , got the shred on the tip of his tongue , leaned over , and spat it on his cardboard . " You 're not going to do anything to Ponniman , I hope . " " Hell , no , now that would give a black eye to real estate prices . . . manhandle a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the North would n't feel safe down here any more . No sir , we 've got to make it clear to the world that a man with money is safe down here in Alabama , Ashton . . . and the more money he 's got , the safer he is . By God , that 's not only good business , it 's justice , it 's a man 's reward for accumulating something . "   " They were talking about doing something to him , " said the lawyer . " Yes , and that 's a mighty good sign they ai n't going to do anything at all to him , " returned Bodine . " What was your idyah ? " asked Ashton . " I think we better drop back on our original plan and finish up the work we started out to do a coupla weeks ago . You see , when Ponniman gets here and does n't find any clients to defend , if they 've just vanished while he was riding the t rain , that ought to be pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Southern people how t they 're to manage their niggers . " Ashton sat for a few moments in silence and began to shake his head slowly . " I could n't have any part in that . " " I do n't want you or anybody in Florence to have any part in it . All I ask is for you to stay at home and do n't go ground organizing a damned illegal mob of Rotarians and Lions and what not to oppose the perfectly regular applicationof the unwritten law here in the South . Now , there 's Colonel Vaiden , the damned old . . . " " Now look out . . . he 's got money ! " " He stole it ! " " But he 's got it . " " Hell , I 'm not saying anything against him . " " I thought you were going to . " " No , I just believe he 's wrong when he says stringing up half a dozen niggers will hurt the boom . I think it 'll help Fit . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big lynching like that would make the Yankees down here realize that their wives and daughters are safe . Why , hell , we 'd go after a nigger that had ravished a Northern lady just as quick as we would a Southern lady .. . quicker , a strange lady in a strange land needs protection wore . " Ashton had not realized that there could be a touch of gallantry in lynchings ; he had considered them stereotyped ; short cuts to avoid the law 's delay and uncertainty . " So what I 'm asking of you Florence business men , " repeatedBodine , " is . . . hands off . " " I have no personal interest in a bunch of negro brutes , " assured Ashton earnestly . " If their case ever comes up before the court , I 'll do what I can to clear them , because it 's my sworn duty ; but I hope you understand , and every roan in the country understands , that I would n't lift a finger to protect ' em . . . I mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ashton , people believe lawyers have n't got any consciences. . . they little know . . . they little realize . . . Well , good-day , Brother . " Bodine opened a silver cigarette case , tapped one , put it in his mouth , lit it with a silver lighter , and went out the door.  |p169RuMORS  that Bodine would renew his attempt at jail deliveryand lynching went about Florence through swift and devious channels . Miss Marsan Vaiden heard it through Red McLaughlin , who had every reason to know what he was talking about . Red came to the table where Marsan was working in the laboratory and told her the news that another lynching was due that night , but veiled it in clumsy innuendo . Marsan replied sharply that she was not interested in the recurrence of the melodrama . Red was no longer her dissectingpartner . She had had him transferred to another table . The girl now detested Red , but Red did not detest her . Instead of that , he thought about her more continuously than He had ever done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever met . In the one or two sexual affairs into which Red had blunderedwith good-natured animality , the girl had never before dropped Red instantly and completely after their first contact . They usually ended through jealousy or parental disveryor parental suspicion . Marsan had none of theseasons , she simply had cut him off . She had even gone eyond the usual verbal cattishness of the normal angry girl and had asked Professor Petrie to give her another bench mute in biology . This had been done . Red was furious when Petrie called him upstairs and informed him of the change . Something violent must have happened , for a few minutes later Red came down with shining excited eyes and told Marsan that from now on Petrie would not . be butting into their business .   The girl , instead of siding with Red , cried out : " What have you done , Red McLaughlin ? " and ran past him up the broad dusty stairs . She found Petrie bathing a puffed cut lip in a carbolic solution . His shoulders were dusty and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to take the sponge to dab on t solution herself . She was trembling with fury at Red and w i I I pity for Mr. Petrie . " You can turn him out of school , " she quivered , " the beefy , butt-headed , thick-skulled bull ! " She brushed the dust from his coat and used a pin on the rip in his sleeve . Marsan 's heart melted for Petrie . She recalledthe Goths entering the Roman Senate and standing in awe until one of their number pulled a venerable Senator 's beard . When Petrie was ready to go , Marsan drove him home in her car . " How came you and Red to get into a fight ? " she asked as she motored toward Tombigbee Street . " Oh . . . he said something .... " " What ? " " It . . . makes no difference . " The concealed thoughts of men appear very clumsy and obvious to women . Marsan immediately knew just about what had taken place between the two . Petrie had asked Red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Petrie had replied that the reason was not to be discussed . Red had said it was because Petrie was jealous of Marsan ... or something like that . Whatever it was , it had caused a fight . The whole affair had placed Marsan in an uncomfortable and embarrassing position . Petrie was evidently more or less in love with her , or he would not have changed her desk so promptly or fought Red . She saw this clearly enough , or thought she did . , . " You are going to expel Red from school , are n't you ? " she asked tensely .   " No-o , " said Petrie , " I do n't think I 'll do anything about it . " This let Marsan in for another long anxious cycle of analyses . The reason Petrie was going to let it go was because lie was putting Red on an equal footing with himself as far as Marsala was concerned . It was the same as saying they were both her sweethearts and he would take no advantage of his bring a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to Marsan . Red had told their intimacy , and Petrie had knocked him down for it. his was dismissed as soon as imagined , but it gave the girl asudden painful wrench . . . if Mr. Petrie really felt that way bout her . . . if something came up about her sufficiently serious to cause him to endure a knock-down and a cut lip and t it go . . . Marsan drove on with a kind of dizzy , painful operative in her head . " Mr. Petrie , " she said , " did Red say anything about c ? " " Why ... yes ... he did , Marsan . " " Something . . . against me ? " " Why , no , not against you , " Petrie gave a wry swollenppedsmile , " for you , in a way . " The girl slowed down the car , she was growing so shaky it as hard to guide it . " Mr. Petrie . . . did . . . did you know that . . . that there re @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . who . . . " she moistened her lips , " . . well . . . do n't act just as they ought to act th . . . with boys ? " Petrie looked hard at her . " I t has come up once or twice in school . " " 1 t . . . happens maybe oftener than it comes up . " " I suppose it does . . . naturally . " A little pulse began beating painfully in Marsan 's temple . " I . . . Red was with me the night they tried to lynch the igger boys . When ... when everybody was ... was yelling t Papa . . . Red knocked one of the men down and . . and upped them .... I was awfully grateful to him . "   " Yes ? " " Then . . . then we went on car riding together , and .. . and he wanted me . . . to do something for him .... " " I knew he had insulted you , " said Petrie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ denied it , and I struck him before I thought . " Marsan drew a long breath and clung to the steering wheel . " He . . . he did n't insult me . . . he . . . I . . . but , afterwards , I wanted to get rid of him .... " Petrie remained silent for a full minute staring at the white-faced girl ; he asked in a strange voice : " Why did you tell me ? " " Because . . . you . . . taking rides with me . . . like you do . . . " the road made little shakes before her eyes at each beat of her heart , " I wanted you to know . . . that 's all . "  |p173MR  . J. ADLEE PETRIE got out of the motor at his boarding house on Tombigbee Street , and Marsan Vaiden drove home alone . On her way back Marsan reflected that all of her speculationsabout Mr. Petrie had been wrong . He had not been in love with her . He had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and this assumption had caused his fight with Red McLaughlin . Her confession to him had been entirely without point . Dusk was gathering when she reached the manor , and the dinner gong sounded as she turned the car over to Wilson under the porte-cochere . When she entered the dining room she marked the somewhat unusual circumstance that Sydna had no guests that evening and the table had been shortened to a square . The fourth side was waiting for Marsan . As she went around and kissed her father , whom she had not seen that day , the dark eyes of her grandmother , Drusilla , followed the girl . Finally the pretty white-haired old lady asked what was the matter . Marsan placed a smile on her face , said nothing was wrong , and slipped into her chair . " There 's no use my asking her , " observed Sydna looking et Marsan , " she never tells anything to me . " " She 's a Vaiden , " said Drusilla , " you can always tell when anything has happened to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is . Now , when anything happened to a Lacefieldthe family was never allowed to forget what it was . " Her elders always got at Marsan obliquely . Now the girl sat with a faint smile on her face , thinking , " Suppose I should tell them about Red McLaughlin and then that I had actually told that to Mr. Petrie because I thought he loved me . . . what would they do ? " Aloud she said : " Well , if you must know , Red McLaughlin told me that the men were going to make another try at hanging those negroes in the jail tonight . " Old Colonel Vaiden laid down his fork . " Do you suppose that 's true , Marsan ? " " Oh yes , Red never thinks up things ; he has n't enough imagination to lie . " " Fib , darling , fib , " corrected Sydna . Her mother 's Victorianism always amused the girl . " All right . . . f-i-b . . . for insuring belief ' ... that 's really ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ponniman had taken a hand in it . Ponniman should be shown , the North should be shown . The only trouble about this conversation was that it was broken on account of Mary , the maid . When Mary was in the dining room , none of them could use the term " nigger " lest they hurt Mary 's feelings , and they could not call the six criminals in jail " colored boys , " as that was far too complimentary a term , so they were forced to shift topics each time Mary reappeared with a dish . " I wonder who sent for that outrageous Ponniman , anyway , " ejaculated Sydna . " The person who did it ought to be spanked . " Marsan straightened up . " Why ought he ? " Sydna was surprised . " For bringing him down here , of course ; why , likely as not he 'll set those negroes free ! " " He 'd do it legally , would n't he ? " " That 's the danger , " said Sydna , never knowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It 's in the constitution of the United States and Alabamatoo that everybody has a right to be tried by a jury in court . "   " You know very well , Marsan , constitutions were n't : nude to be applied to negroes . " " They do n't teach that in the High School . " " Of course , your teachers ca n't come out in plain English and say it , Marsan , but at least they ought to give their pupils enough of a hint so when they come to study the consitiution they can read between the lines . " As Marsan continued eating and talking , she wondered what her mother would think if she told her that a negro had on a prize in college over Mr. Petrie . Her mother wouldst go up in the air , she would expire if she knew that . It ould be as cataclysmic to Sydna , but set in a different key , a knowledge of her own and Red McLaughlin 's affair . When dinner was over , old Colonel Vaiden went up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed a little way , asking him would he remain and listen to e radio . The older women knew what disturbed her longsuitor who had become the husband of her daughter . e thought if Miltiades would stay below and listen to the n I esque noises of some jazz orchestra he would forget that which troubled him , the phantom of a negro boy who was urged . The old man , however , thanked her and followed the wide of the steps into the upper hallway with its solemn row dark doors and polished knobs . He walked through the halld entered his study , a wooden room which he had added toe main brick building over his porte-cochere . He went inle , closed the door after him , walked across and stood by alow looking out into the last of the evening light . The Colonel was turning in his mind whether or not he mild drive downtown and attempt once more to organize e business men of Florence against Bodine 's repeated .. The trouble was , with Phineas Ponniman about to end the prisoners , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaken in his own resolution against wettings . A kind of debate in pictures moved through his imagination like rival cinemas : a Yankee lawyer taking it on himself to set a Southern court right in its handling of negroes ; and the opposing picture of an almost white negro , the Colonel 's own son , who was named Toussaint Vaiden , strung up to one of the mulberries in Courthouse Square . This boy , of his own flesh , had come to his death because he had had the temerity to enter suit against the Colonel for the possession of a pair of mules . The effrontery of a negro offering to appear in a court of law against a white man had encompassed his hanging . During the events that led up to this lynching , Colonel Vaiden had been unaware that the negro boy opposing him was his son . Then it had happened , just on the hour of the tragedy  --  the octoroon mother of the boy had come to the Colonel and told him Toussaint Vaiden was their son and pleaded with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ octoroon 's life . The two had got into an old wagon together from the gate of this very manor in which he now stood and had loped the mules to Courthouse Square in time for the cream-colored woman to cut down the dead body of their son . All this went through the old banker 's head with mournful iteration . He had not known Toussaint Vaiden was his son . He had known , of course , that he had had congress with Gracie , the quadroon girl who had been his father 's slave , and whose body , on one single ill-starred night , he had taken by force . From somewhere in the grove surrounding the manor the Colonel heard the high quavering call of an owl . This reminded him again of his father 's log cabin , of fox hunting , of the rides of the original Ku Klux Klan of which he was an organizer . He thought how , after the war , everyone had expectedhim to become a great man , and how for twenty years he did nothing at all , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the collection of an old debt had started him on the road to the wealth he now possessed . And as he had climbed that road to power , his octoroon son , who had inherited something of his own tenac-P177ity and pride , had come into conflict with him , his father , over a mule . . . and this had led to his violent death . The Colonel thought how strange all this private history would seem when he lay in his sarcophagus in All Souls Cathedral , where Honor and Fame would sentinel his name . A discreet tapping at the side door of his study caused the Colonel to switch on a light and call for his visitor to come in. 1 t was his chauffeur , Wilson , who had climbed up a narrow blind stairway that led down between the walls to the portecocherebelow . The Colonel asked what he wanted , and Wilsonsaid there was a lady to see him . " In the porte-cochere ? " " Yes suh . " " Does n't she want to see Sydna . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants to see you . " " What made you climb up the back stairs to announce her ? " " She said she wanted to see jest you , suh ; I clum ' up to see if jest you wuz in . " The Colonel divined that the woman had come to ask shout the wisdom of an investment . He told Wilson to show her up , then sat down and awaited her coming with resignation . The woman would want to ask very privately whether he thought lots would go still higher , and would the boom last much longer . The distrust in the permanence of the boom w which lay implicit in these questions had long since lost their humor for the Colonel . The pertinacity of people in getting more money when he himself was thinking of life and fate disgusted the banker . Here the side door of his study opened twain and Wilson ushered in a white-haired old woman who , for a second or two , Miltiades thought was Drusilla . But this woman was stooped , her face was thinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman 's face was an expression of habitual sadness , instead of the satirical tolerance with which Drusilla smiled on the world . The old banker arose and indicated a chair .   " We 're having fine weather , " he began conventionally . " I was just sitting here waiting for the moon to come up . I had a landscape gardener from Baltimore come and do any grounds particularly for moonlight effects , because I 'm at home mostly at night . The different quarters of the noon make quite different effects . " The old gentleman paused , looking out of his window onto the still dark landscape : " And now , madam , I trust I can be of some service to you ? " " My great-grandson is in jail , " said the visitor . " In jail ? " " Yes , and he is just a little boy , as you can see he would have to be . " Miltiades looked at the old woman closely . " What jail ? " " The jail here in Florence . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Florence jail except six negro boys .... " The caller nodded . Her old face twitched , but she composed , i.t by force to its habitually sad expression , then sat outwardly calm again . " James is a negro , " she said in a low voice . The Colonel frowned ; he regretted that he had given this old negro woman a chair . It made him uncomfortable for a negro to be seated in his presence . His caller must have sensed this , because she put her thin hands on the arms of the chair and with an effort got up . The old white man came away from the window and sat down . " What do you want me to do ? " " Could n't you bail him out , Colonel Milt ? " " Not with the charge against him , he  --  he 's one of the  --  of the six , is n't he ? " " Yes sir . " " Look here , " interjected the Colonel at the slight mystery that had developed in his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a train ; I did n't know any of them lived around here ? "   " My great-grandson does n't . " " Where does he live ? " " In Chicago . " " A Northern negro ! " ejaculated the banker . " Why in the devil did he come South ? . . . You are not Northern . " " I used to live here in Florence , and . . . a long time ago . . . in Montgomery . " The Colonel did not observe this bit from the old negro woman 's private history . " Why did n't you tell him to stay where he was ? Did n't you know there is no place for a Northern negro except the North ? " The old woman drew a long breath . " He wanted to see his folks . " " Your folks ? " " Yes sir , I 'd been telling him about them all his life ; so he ran away , beat his way down here on a train to see them .. . he is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the old woman . " Of course , " he said harshly , " his own people down here , the ones he came to see , are in no position to help him .. . but there is no way to bail him out under any condition . " The old quadroon stood looking at the Colonel . " Yes . . . his people could help him , Colonel Milt . " " You . . . you do n't mean his . . . white people ? " " Yes sir . " " M  --  m . . . well , they could n't possibly acknowledge .. . especially considering the crime he 's charged with .... " " But , Colonel Milt , " pleaded the old woman , " that 's impossible . . . he 's only a little boy . . . . " " Well . . . why do n't you ask some of his . . . white kin ? " " I am . " The Colonel stared at the thin weak old woman before him . " Me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes sir . "   " Who in the hell are you ? " " I 'm Gracie , Colonel Milt . " The old banker and dictator of Florence was inexpressibly repelled by the identity of the old slave woman his father once had owned ; by the fact that long ago he had taken this old woman 's body by force and she had borne a son . She had not borne him a son , she had simply borne a son , unclaimed by anyone save herself . " Why in God 's name did you let your damned grandson come down here , Gracie ? " cried the old white man in extreme exasperation . " I did n't . . . he ran away . . . he wanted to see . . . I had told him so much about you-all . " " Why did n't you tell him about his colored relations ? .. My God , are the white Vaidens . . . " The withered old quadroon pointed a scornful finger at the man . " Colored relations ! What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old Hannah , long after Old Pap sold off her husband Jericho ! I 'm not white for nothing ! Aunt Creasy told me long ago that my father was Old Pap , the same as yours ! Toussaint , the son I had by you , was nothing but a Vaiden on both sides . The child Lucy had by Toussaint , the son you hanged , I named Marcia ; and Marcia 's boy you 're holding in jail this minute is named James Vaiden Hodige . Who would my grandchild come back to see except white people , Miltiades ? " The tone of the old woman 's voice , the look about her eyes made it seem to the old banker as if his domineering older sister Cassandra had arisen from her grave and was bemeaning him . There was almost nothing for him to say . He did ask why Gracie had not sent her grandson somewhere to see the Hodiges , whoever they were . And the quadroon answered : " Because I , Gracie Vaiden , his grandmother , told him about the Vaidens @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and not from the white Hodiges of Georgia . " P181The old Colonel stared , made a peremptory gesture toward the side door . " Shame on you , Gracie , coming here and talking disrespectfullylike this ! If you were n't so old ... y-o-u . . . Get out ! Take yourself off ! Go ! "  |p182THE  moon and the landscape gardener from Baltimore conspiredtogether against old Colonel Vaiden 's wrath . At first the moon set forth the Vaiden trees in solemn silhouette , then rising higher , it spread over their dark masses a silvern veil . The moon pleaded the cause of the Hodige negro in the Florence jail more subtly than did the greatgrandmother'sbitter tongue . The prisoner was not only the great-grandson of old Gracie , but of the Colonel himself . Through what obscure channels his blood had flowed since that distant hour in his father 's barn when he had taken by force ... half sister . . . daughter of a slave called Old Hannah . . . his father ... . It was like strangling a python at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looped another coil ; another and another . The old banker stood at the window , trembling at the chain of wrongs and violences around which his life had been molded . . . . Gracie 's rape . . . his theft of the Handback estate ... the lynching of his boy Toussaint . . . now this great-grandson lodged in jail under the shadow of violence . Any or all of these catastrophes the old Colonel could have borne with fortitude , but tonight , standing in the moonlit window , he seemed to discern in his life the cold maleficent direction of Nemesis . And a sudden dismaying conviction seized on the old man that his future lay under the shadow of the same unseen power which had shaped the mien and horror of his past . By an effort of will the old Colonel put such empty thoughts out of his mind , crossed his study , and pressed a button . He stood waiting with the patient belligerence of anP183old man when Wilson appeared . The Colonel ordered his big car . " And , Wilson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . somebody who . . . " He broke off , pondering . " I wo n't do ? " asked the colored man in surprise . " No , you wo n't do . " He stood casting about in his mind for a possible driver for his undertaking when he thought of his nephew , the Reverend Jerry Catlin . So he continued to Wilson : " You go get Jerry and get back here by the time I get my hat and coat . " Wilson was immediately concerned to make precise connections . From the head of the stairs he turned and asked his waster not to get into his hat and overcoat too fast . Fifteen minutes later Wilson was back under the portecocherewith the assistant minister in his car . Miltiades had just come down the blind stairway . He stepped out under the dome light , a trim , sedate old figure , adjusting a soft beaver hat . He hoped he had n't disturbed his nephew from important work . It was nothing important ; Jerry had been working out a sermon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , here am I , " illustrating the sacrificial spirit . " Wilson said you wanted me to drive you tonight . " " Jerry , I wish you would . " Wilson got out of the car , and the old banker stepped in. the sedan moved out into Pine Street the Colonel began a serious tone : " Jerry , are you willing to help stave off the trouble everybody is expecting at the jail tonight ? " The assistant minister glanced at his uncle . " I knew that was what you wanted . " " And it 's all right . . . you 're willing ? " " Why , of course . . . . What are we going to do ? . . . I  --  I 'm not a pistol shot . " " Drive me to Judge Wilson 's home on Laurel Street . " " Think he 'll help you ? "   " I believe so . " " Do n't you think he will resent Ponniman coming i n t o this case the same as everyone else ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appeal to the Judge ... " He broke off . " That 's his house , yonder . " The car stopped before a dark low bungalow . Jerry gut out and went up to the door . After knocking and later finding and ringing a bell , a porch light came on above his head . A little later the door opened , and Judge Wilson appeared . When the jurist saw it was Jerry , he asked with excitement : " Dr. Catlin , has anything happened . . . downtown ? " Jerry explained that his uncle Milt was in the car . " Tell him to come on in .... " Here the Colonel himself called in a low voice for the Judge to come out . Judge Wilson stepped back inside , switched off the porch light , then went with Jerry to the motor . " It 's a damned shame , " observed the Judge when the three men were in the car , " when citizens like us who have legal intentions here in Florence find it advisable to hold their councils in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've come for ? " suggested Miltiades . " In a general way . I do n't know exactly what you want me to do . " " Listen , Henry . . . I do n't want those niggers lynched . " " Neither do I , but Ponniman 's come into court . He 'll object to every scrap of evidence we 've got . I 'll quash his objections , he 'll appeal , and the Supreme Court will sustain him . . . . " " Listen , Henry , " interrupted Miltiades impatiently , " I 've thought of a solution to all our difficulties , personal and civic . " " What do you mean by civic ? " " Oh , I mean our financial objection to lynchings . " " Well , what 's your idea ? " " Change of venue . " P185Both Jerry and the Judge were surprised . They tried to look at each other in the dark car . " Oh what grounds ? " inquired the Judge curiously . " Why , those niggers ca n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and you know it . " Judge Wilson hemmed slightly . " To just what Southern court would you suggest that I i ransfer this case , where they would get justice ? " he inquired dryly . " I do n't care a damn about that . It makes no difference where they go or what happens to them when they get there , I want ' em out of Florence . That 's my real grounds for asking a change of venue . What may break out any minute now will be the worst possible publicity for our town . So I 'm asking you for a change of venue . " Judge Wilson pondered , shook his head slowly , and said in a regretful voice : " Milt . . . I ca n't grant it . " " Why not ? " " You 're not the defendant 's lawyer . You are no relation to any of the accused . You have no position in the case the law can recognize . " The old Colonel began with a sharp , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his throat , sat in silence for upward of half a minute , then began again in a strained voice : " Listen , Henry , all my holdings , all the bank 's holdings , acid I suppose most of your holdings are wrapped up somehowor other in the boom . There is not a citizen in town who will not be disastrously affected if a great blow should be dealt Florence real estate . In my opinion , if Bodine 's gang commit any violence tonight ; if Ponniman brings about the reical sort of trial that Northern lawyers have succeeded in posing upon Southern courts : any of those things will do great and irremediable damage to Florence just at this moment . " " Well . . . what about it ? "   " Just this : I 'm asking you , as an interested citizen of Florence , for a change of venue on the ground that the trial is a public nuisance . " The three men remained in silence for three or four seconds ; then both Jerry and the Judge broke into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of all pleas ! Oust a trial because it 's a public nuisance ! " " Hell . . . is n't it ? " " Well . . . yes . . . in a way . . . but , my God , Milt , what will the Northern papers say if I abate my court as a public nuisance ? " " You need n't put it in those words , Henry . Grant a change of venue , the public welfare requiring it . For it certainly does , there 's no question about that . " Judge Wilson sat pondering this extraordinary request . Finally he began : " Do you know , Milt , I believe your plea would hold . If a trial held in a certain place would work great harm to the community , I see no reason why it should n't be held somewhere else . I 'm going to grant you your change of venue . " " All right . . . I 'd like to take the prisoners to Athens to-night . " " You 'll take them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I , nobody will suspect us of trying to get away with them . " " I would have to send an officer with you . " " Send Deputy Northrup . I know his family . I stood up when Heck Northrup , this boy 's granddaddy , married Susie Ham in Waterloo at the outbreak of the war . Write me out a habeas corpus , and I 'll have Northrup serve it . " All this was spoken very rapidly . Judge Wilson responded to the Colonel 's urgency and hurried back into his house with the assistant minister on his heels . In his study the jurist produced some blank forms and began to fill them in . Jerry looked at his watch . It was fifteen minutes after ten . He listened to see if he could hear any commotion downtown.  |p187Although  the Judge scratched away at a great rate , he seemed to write slowly . Finally he handed Jerry two papers , a habeas corpus and a mittimus with which to lodge the prisoners in the Athens jail . Jerry took them and ran @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ listened intently in the silent streets . " Get in , get in , " hurried the Colonel , " if anything is happening , it 's happening ; all we can do is start . " " Where does Northrup live ? " asked Jerry starting the car . " Now , damn it , where does he live ? " repeated the Colonel . Neither of them knew . Northrup was one of those poor men who live in houses nobody except other poor men can locate . " He 's not a Methodist , " twitched Jerry impatiently , " or 1 'd know where he lived . " " His granddaddy was a Baptist , " supplied Miltiades . " Let me see . . . I know where the Baptist minister lives , " said Jerry . He veered the car into a side street and presently stopped at a house . He honked , and the minister came out and l asked If anybody wanted to get married . " We want to know where Deputy Sheriff Northrup lives , " willed Jerry . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ... " " That 's the man , " hurried Miltiades , " he 's named for his grandmammy 's family . " The Baptist minister gave an address , and the car sped across town to East Florence . The Reverend Catlin stopped before a small dark house , blew his horn and honked . He continued this disturbance until a voice shouted : " What do you want with me ? " " Come out , Northrup . . . this is Colonel Miltiades Val-den . " " The hell it is . . . be out in a minute . " When he came up lo the car he asked , " What in the world do you fellows want ? "   " We have a habeas corpus from Judge Wilson to those six niggers to the jail in Athens . " " Well , we better get a move on us . . . . How did you get such a writ ? " " The Colonel here got the writ on the ground that the trial is a public nuisance . " Northrup exploded into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Well , the damn thing is ... But , looky here , I do n't want to run into trouble trying to serve these writs . " " Well , if you 're any kin to old man Erasmus Ham , " stated the Colonel roundly , " you do n't particularly give a damn whether you get into trouble or not , as long as you are doing your duty . " Northrup cleared his throat . " Now , that 's so , too . " He nodded firmly . " Gim me your papers an ' le 's git to Courthouse Square quick as we can . While I ai n't shunnin ' trouble , I ai n't looking for it , either . I ai n't that kind of a fool . " Jerry got to Courthouse Square at high speed . The Square itself seemed deserted . The big car crossed to Intelligence Row , passed through the alley leading by the fire station , and stopped before the jail . Jerry and Northrup got out nervously and went to the door . Northrup climbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground . At the third knock they heard the jailer inside ask in a tense voice what was wanted . Northrup whispered through the keyhole : " Jim . . . for God 's sake , lemme in . . . this is Ham . " " Ham ! " " Lemme in quick . I got a habeas corpus for the nig-gers ! " " What you goin ' to do with ' em ? " " Take ' em to jail in Athens . " The key turned inside ; the jail door opened a small space to verify Ham 's words , then swung wider . Northrup went inside.  |p189Jerry  stood listening and looking all about the street as he waited for the prisoners . In the midst of this watching andicing he was startled to see a man step out of the shadow ( if the jail almost beside him . The fellow looked at Jerry intently for a moment , then made a grotesque gesture andwhispered : " Hello , old peckerwood , what 's up ? " " Who are you ? " asked Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighty-two of seventeen .... Is the head knocker out there ? " He pointed to the car . " What 's your name ? " asked Jerry . " Of course , that 's q.t. , but it 's Rutledge , Willie Rutledge , " said the man in a low tone . " Who 's in that car ? " " Colonel Milt Vaiden . " " The Colonel . . . what the hell 's he doing here ? I thought lie was aginst ... " " Go talk to him , " suggested Jerry . " What 's he waitin ' for ? " " He 'll tell you . . . talk to him . " Rutledge turned toward the alley and gave a soft whistle ; another figure came around the corner of the jail . Rutledge whispered to the newcomer : " It 's Colonel Milt Vaiden in the car . " " What does he want ? " asked the new man . " I suppose he 's going to stay here and make another ' ech , " surmised Rutledge . The newcomer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a hell of a chanst tonight . " At that moment a clanking came from inside the jail . The door opened , and six bedraggled negro boys came out , handcuffedand chained together . The smallest boy asked , " Where 's the car ? " then saw it and started to run toward it , toil was jerked back with a sharp rattling of the chain . Thenext boy started to run and was jerked . Then the next and the next until the whole line gathered headway and the six scuttled to the car jangling their chain .   Rutledge and his fellow guard watched the negroes dash for the automobile in the utmost amazement . The door of the car swung open . As the six scrambled in the old Colonel said : " I am Miltiades Vaiden . Hodige , stand behind me . The rest of you niggers pack yourselves in the best you can ! " " Yes suh ! Yes suh ! " Northrup and the jailer climbed in after the prisoners . Jerry hurried around to the other side and slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran up alongside . " Hey , who 's running this ? " cried the strange man . " I am , " said the Colonel . " Drive on , Jerry ! " The car began to move away . The two men stepped on the running board : " Did you-all get ' em out for the association ? " " We 've got them out on a habeas corpus , " stated the Colonel crisply . " Who for ? " " For the citizens of Florence . " " Where you taking them ? " " There 's no telling . . . faster , Jerry . " As the car gathered speed the two men jumped off the running board , struck the street , took two preternaturally long steps , and dived headlong into the pavement . They jumped up again and began yelling something . Men here and there began appearing along the seemingly empty street . " Step on it , " said Northrup to Jerry ; " them men have got cars ! " Jerry shoved down the accelerator , but he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from side to side . " Hell fire , hold her in the road ! " yelled the jailer . Everybodyexcept Jerry began looking back . Sure enough , headlightswere following them . They gained upon the sedan . " Can you go faster and keep her wheels under her ? " cried the jailer . The miles were now whirling past with the minutes .   " Jerry , " called Miltiades above the whistling wind , " slow down . . . we 're coming to Shoal Creek bridge ! " " Hell , Colonel , they 'll ketch us right now , " cried the deputy sheriff . " They 'll catch us anyway . . .. Northrup , get out your keys ! " " To what ? " " The handcuffs . " " What for ? " " We 've got to jetsam a nigger ! " " What 's that ? " " Heave some overboard to save the others ! " " Will it do it ? " " Hell , yes , the mob will stop for one or two ! " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones . You know these little niggers did n't anything wrong . . . they could n't . " Northrup reached for the child behind Miltiades ' seat . " Here , boy , hold up your wrists ! " " Wh-whut you going to do ? " " Two of you are going to jump over that bridge into the , " snapped Miltiades . " Can you boys swim ? " " Yes suh ! Yes sub ! " " ' Take it slow , Jerry . " The headlights of the pursuing motors were now all over lie fugitive car . Ahead the Shoal Creek bridge seemed to the toward Jerry . The assistant minister slackened his speed as he took the approach . The cars behind rushed upon . In the throat of the bridge the old Colonel shoved opencar door . " Jump clear of the bridge ! " he ordered . The next instant the two smaller negro boys went out of he  --  car like monkeys . One cleared the planking like a dark arrow shooting through the beating light ; the other touched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ferry , you and Northrup get out and try to catch them ! " ' tied the Colonel .   " When we catch them , wo n't the niggers get killed ? " " Yes . . . when . . . and if ... " Jerry halted at the end of the bridge . He and Northrup leaped out . The jailer took the wheel and started forward . Jerry and Northrup stood in the oncoming headlight s waving their arms , pointing at the side of the bridge , and shouting frantically : " They got away ! Men , they jumped out of the car ! They 're in the creek ! "  | The mob in the onrushing cars did not know how many negroes or how many white men there were in the escaping automobile . Every pursuer knew that some or all the negroes hid escaped . Jerry furthered the idea by rushing to the rail where the negro boys had jumped , hanging over , peering down and shouting : " They 're in the creek ! They got loose in the car @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cars , " Get out and help catch these niggers . . . they got out of the car ! " The notion of an escaped negro flings a Southern mob Into the same sort of hysteria that a terrier has over a rat . The cars stopped , the men boiled out with guns and pistols slid dashed to the point where the two children had leaped off the bridge . " Where are they ... where 'd they go to ? " Sharp self-reproach filled Jerry that he had lacked the wit to run to some other place than precisely where the little negro boys had dived . He pointed at an angle : " Down there ! Right down there ! " A dozen men came and pointed their firearms over the rail . In the sudden chase they had not had time to put on their sheets and masks , and now they stood in the beat of the lights with the simple , good-natured , but excited faces of carpenters , dentists , grocers , clerks , small storekeepers , Joule stenographers , who had gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night . Now , to have two little black boys in the creek to hunt for and shoot at Wits a satisfying set-up for these men in this particular mood .   A man close to Jerry suddenly leveled his revolver : nut shot at something in the shimmer beneath the bridge . Jerry 's heart beat as he stared below to see if one of t lie boys had been struck . Fellow members of the associat ion rushed to the shooter , shouting : " Did you see one ? What ye shoot at ? " " Trying to skeer ' em , " explained the man in sharp tones . " Here , ever'body shoot ! Scatter ' em around ! " A fusillade broke out from the bridge . Bullets flicked all over the surface of the creek . The men stopped firing to peer down again to see if anything below was struggling or floating . Jerry himself scanned the surface of the water with such apprehension that it gave him a nauseated feeling . If one or both of the little negroes had been struck @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only the water , rippled by a slight wind . " Get down below , " somebody ordered ; " look for ' cm along the bank . " At this a number of men ran back to the end of the bridge , climbed down , and deployed along the edge of the water . Some of the more cautious shouted to those above : " Do n't shoot while we 're down here ! " Voices above shouted down : " Go ahead . . . hell . . . we 're watching you ! " Jerry could see dim forms of men scrambling along the edge of the creek . Some had flashlights and directed their circles of light here and there . Suddenly pistol shots broke out in one place . There were shouts : " Here one is ! We got him ! " Just then came a heavy splash . A voice hallooed : " Do n't shoot no more , fellows ! A man fell in ! ' Where is he ? He went under right here . Can he swim ? I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he 's hung in the weeds ? " " Look here , somebody , git him out . . . who can swim ? " " He may be foolin ' , tryin ' to skeer us ! "   " Hell fire , he ai n't big enough fool to drown himself , trying to skeer us ! " " Do n't know , brother , some mighty big fools in this here crowd ! " At that moment , some yards below the group , water was broken , a voice choked , gasped , and gurgled into silence again . Voices of the cautious bellowed again : " Do n't anybody up there shoot ! That 's not the niggers ! That 's a man drownin ' ! " " Somebody that can swim , go get him ! " " Hell , you 'll get caught in the weeds . . . reach a stick to him ! " From the bridge in the shimmering light Jerry half saw awn thrusting improvised poles into the water . Then a man jumped in to the drowning man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ victim in his arms . Everybody legged it down to the scene of the near tragedy . When Jerry reached the place , they had the drowned man out jouncing him over a log . Water gushed out of his nose and mouth . A man , evidently a doctor , ordered the figure laid on its back . He knelt astride him and started artificial respiration . The doctor worked and worked . He grew tired and asked if anyone else in the crowd knew the technique . Jerry did , and took the physician 's place . " Do n't go too fast , " warned the medico , " that 's the danger. , , Jerry counted out his rhythm in one-two-three time to preserve his tempo. ' 1'lie drowned man 's ribs felt cold under Jerry 's palms . The minister swung backwards and forwards . Then , under 1 he rays of a flashlight , he saw it was Rutledge who had been drowned . A queer thought came to Jerry that this had befallen Rutledgeso he could not tell who had been in the fugitive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arrived in Florence . Mr. Ragsdale , who was attorney for the Second National Bank , and who was a very prudent man , suggested to Colonel Vaiden that the Rotary Club telegraph to the famous lawyer , warn him of his danger , and advise him to return to New York , as his clients had vanished and there was nothing for him to do . It just happened , however , that Dr. Blankenship was in the Colonel 's office when Ragsdale came in , and the Doctor objected to the telegram . He said he meant to ask Ponniman for a donation to the cathedral , and that his idea was for Florence reverently to leave Ponniman 's safety in the hands of Providence . Here the Doctor turned to Colonel Vaiden to bring to his attention some little financial details in regard to the cathedral . As the hour drew near for the Ponniman train to arrive , a current of motors and pedestrians set through the streets toward the railroad station . As usual , the two hotel buses jockeyed for the best position to yodel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not get into their regular parking space because it was occupied by out-of-town cars . A policeman came and asked one of these obstructive cars to move , but the men in the car were not even interested in his request . They immediately began talking about something else . They said to the officer : " Do you know who ordered Ponniman to come to Florence anyway ? " The silver badge said he did not . " Was n't there a nigger man trying to hire a lawyer to defendthem niggers that got away ? " The policeman said he believed he had heard as much . " Who was it ? " " Well . . . it was a nigger preacher , " answered the silver badge cautiously . " What 's his name ? "  | " I do n't know . " " The hell you do n't . . . you know damn well you know . Look here , just because you are in the service of the law does n't keep you from being a man and an American , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full of men as to his sex and nationality . " Now , we 're asking you for the second time , Brother , who was that nigger preacher that telegraphed for a damned Northern lawyer to come down and run a Southern court , and where does he live ? " " The lawyer ? " asked the officer confused . " Hell , no , the nigger preacher . . . what 's his name and where does he live ? " " His name 's Sinton , and I do n't know where he lives . " " You do n't ! " " No , I really do n't . I do n't much think he even lives here ... he 's a Bishop . " The men laughed at the idea of a nigger being a Bishop . " Oh , well , " said one of the men , " you 're a good fellow , run along and move somebody else out of their place . " " Look here , " said the officer , " you boys stay parked right where you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I would n't get rough with Ponniman . After all , he may be honest in his beliefs . He do n't understand niggers , he do n't understand the Southern people . If he did , he would n't try to give no advice . He 'd realize they ai n't no advice to give . " At that moment from down the track came the far-off scream of a locomotive . The whole crowd moved closer . The policeman hurried through the press to get between them and the train . " Men , fellows , lissen ! " he begged , " no crowdin ' , no pushin ' . . . " He was lost in the movement of the crowd . As the express came to a stop with its bell ringing and engine hissing , a big rough-looking man in a baggy gray suit came out on the front platform of his Pullman and with his mere presence immediately took possession of the crowd.  | Everybody began yelling , " Ponniman ! Ponniman ! " The out-of-town men in the parked car boiled out and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ descending . " Ponniman ! " they shouted . " Speech ! Speech ! " The negro porter dusted Mr. Ponniman from the top of the steps to the train platform , received a dollar , and expressed his thanks with a row of white teeth . Women parked in their cars stared at him with the intentnessof women for a great man . They thought of him variously : as defending them , as a husband , as an ideal for their sons , as a lover . They said to one another : " Did you ever see such a rough-looking man ! " They meant by that that in the South all intellectual leaderswear a scholarly , aristocratic air , whereas in the North they are likely to come unkempt and coarse featured . The Rotarians really gathered Mr. Ponniman unto themselves . He gravitated by affinity into the car of Colonel Vaiden , the Rotarian president . He was taken immediately to the dam and shown that . He was driven over the endless empty subdivisions of the future metropolis of the South . He was shown the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that the promoters could advertise that an apartment house had been built already on their subdivision . That evening they gave Ponniman a banquet , an enormous blow-out at the old Florence Hotel at five dollars a plate . The public was invited . . . Bodine 's association and all . It was at the banquet , before Florence assembled en masse , that Dr. Blankenship suggested to the town 's distinguishedguest that the community was bending all of its spiritual and temporal energies in the construction of a great non-sectarian cathedral dedicated to the fatherhood of God and the brotherhood of man . " And , Mr. Ponniman , " proceeded the Doctor with a slight bow , " while it is nationally known that you find intellectual difficulties in subscribing to the first article in that creed ,  |p201no  one can doubt that your whole life has been dedicated to the service of the brotherhood of man . " Here applause interruptedthe speaker . The Doctor took a sip of water , then continued : " Mr. President of the Rotary Club , this applause convinces me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the character of our distinguished guest . I will say , however , that Mr. Ponniman has come to Florence on an errand of brotherhood , and I feel encouraged to say to Mr. Ponniman , that not only the grown people , but even the little children , are bending body and soul in an effort to raise a great monument to the brotherhood of man . I refer Mr. Ponniman to our cathedral , whose foundations you saw this afternoon . If you could find it in your heart to forward the spiritual and temporal resources of our community , you would place , not only these people assembled here this evening , but generationsyet to come , under obligations to you , sir . " The Doctor made another bow after this eloquent appeal for money and sat down . The whole dining room applauded . Everyone admired the stately self-respecting way the Doctor asked for a donation . The crowd realized as never before how perfectly Dr. Blankenship was fitted to be the great spiritual leader of the wealthiest congregation in Florence . Mr. Ponniman arose to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was proud of the compliment the Doctor had just paid him , and since he had always found complimentsfrom the clergy very expensive luxuries , he supposed he time had now come for him to pay the Doctor . Laughter here in which Dr. Blankenship joined heartily . " I have been greatly interested in the fact that both grown-ups and children are bending body and soul to help build the Doctor 's cathedral , " went on the visitor . " I am not iiurprised at the grown-ups , but it does seem to me that modernchildren ought to know better . Hearty laughter here in which Dr. Blankenship joined . " However , to be serious , or that is , as serious as one can very well be about so essentially humorous a thing as a cathedral : I have spent my morning in Florence in contact with the realtors of Florence . I learned from these gentlemen that the Doctor 's underlying motive in building the cattle ( Intl is to erect a great church with the avowed object of ending all future churches . General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understood the allusion . " Dr. Blankenship , in abolishing churches , is only following Judge Wilson 's lead in abolishing the courts of Alabama . Judge Wilson , I have been given to understand , frankly admitted that his court was a nuisance and abolished it . I can only trust that Dr. Blankenship will not allow a lawyer and a judge to outdo a divine in sincerity of statement . Shouts of laughter from everyone but the Doctor . " In regard to my position on the fatherhood of God , Dr. Blankenship has stated my position correctly . I will say here what I have said in numberless addresses and debates . I believe religion is the child of fear . It is man 's dread of the dark , it is his shudder at the tomb . " I have discovered , Dr. Blankenship , that those persons are most religious whose lives are cast in the most uncertain places . During the World War epidemics of religion broke out . Sailors in peril by sea are both superstitious and religious . I am using tautology here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words as synonyms . Coal miners , trapeze performers , knife swallowers , people who take patent medicines , in fact , all persons whose lives are continually in great peril are , by the very texture of their days , religious people . " Loud laughter . Mr. Ponniman cleared his throat , looked about the banquethall , lowered his voice to a solemn tone : " The negroes here in the South , I have been told , are a profoundly religious people . Laughter reduced to uncertain chuckles here and there . " Therefore , Dr. Blankenship , in your movement to abolish churches I join you heart and soul . But I disapprove your method . I think the surest way to abolish churches is not to build a huger church than ever , but to build schoolsP203and arrange human society so it is equally safe for both blacks and whites ; otherwise you are going to have in your midst forever a black world incurably religious . " Mr. Ponniman sat down . A silence fell over the dining room . The older women who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and agnostic smiled mechanically with shocked faces . Some younger women and girls pulled down their faces to keep from laughing outright . At this point , a plainly dressed diner with the simple face of a mechanic arose from his seat away over in the corner and called in a voice shaking with stage fright , " 1'Ir . Toastmaster . . . Mr. Toastmaster ... " Bill Bradley , who was near the man , called out : " Hey , Milt , recognize this gentleman ! " " I recognize the gentleman , " called the Colonel from the distant speaker 's table . The new speaker stood up , twisting his paper napkin . " Mr. Toastmaster , I  --  I wish to p-protest against , Mr. 1 ' - Ponniman 's speech . It  --  it is n't just fear  --  fear of death  --  as he says . I  --  I was dead last night sensation 1 was drowned , and they brought me back to life . . . . Dr. Pratt did . . . and Mr. Catlin . But now , I , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I am looking forward to it with all my heart . t ) h , my friends , my brothers , you have no idea of what happiness , what bliss . I was up in the moonlight , free . . . freer than I have ever been in all my life . . . and I was dead .... " Here Ponniman 's Northern twang interrupted the man 's ecstasy : " My friend , your experience is not unusual . For some reason extreme weakness sometimes tends to produce beatific hallucinations in the human brain . You surely are not asking us to accept this vision you saw as verity ? " ' The man stood staring at the lawyer . " But  --  but it 's the truth , Mr. Ponniman . I  --  I was consciousevery minute of the time . I could see up through a hole in the water . . . about four inches across . . . suddenly I floated up through this hole out of the water high in the moonlight .... Oh it was wonderful . Then I felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than anything in my whole life . Nothing has ever been so horrible as to come back and enter my body again . " Ponniman said : " My friend , you know there was no hole in the water . " " Oh yes  --  yes , sir , there was , Mr. Ponniman . " Someone pulled the fellow from behind . " Rutledge , sit down , " said a voice . Everyone was pleased that the drowned man had been hushed . He made the diners uncomfortable . Everyone felt , that his maunderings bordered on sacrilege.  |p205EVERYBODY  in Florence who was anybody had attended the luncheon given in honor of Phineas Ponniman . They had , indeed , under the spell of the man , laughed at his speech , but no sooner were they out of the hotel than they began to grow angry at what he had said , and the more they thought about it . the angrier they got . Colonel Vaiden said he could not understand how a man of Ponniman 's brains could possibly be an atheist . Marsan opened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front of the hotel . As Sydna entered , she said that she supposed Yankees always paid off courtesy with discourtesy . Her grandfather , during the war , had been the host of a Yankee colonel , and t lie last thing he did before he marched his regiment away was to burn down her grandfather 's house . As Sydna said this a queer thing happened to Jerry Catlin . The graceful woman seemed to embody all that men meant by the qualitatives charming and aristocratic . The very historicity of her resentment cast a glamour over her whole person . The change was like that which comes over a lamp when it is lighted . What had been casual and inconspicuous suddenly becomes a warm radiant center which reveals and gives meaning to every other thing . An extraordinary physicalreaction set up in Jerry , a sudden stricture in his chest , n sensation as if his viscera had been lowered in his body . It was dismaying to Jerry to be so shocked and moved by tile wife of his uncle . Why it happened , how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here on the crowded street with people pouring out from the luncheon . His psychical lunge toward her would go away as abruptly as it had rushed over him , he supposed , and hoped . A man in the outpouring throng touched Jerry 's sleeve . When Jerry turned , the stranger removed his hat in deference to the ladies in the car . " This is Dr. Catlin ? " " Yes . " " You are the minister who invited the Realtors ' Associationto give a thousand dollars a month to the cathedral ? " " I requested the donation . . . yes . " " I was sitting beside Mr. Sanborne when Mr. Ponniman alluded to it . He pointed you out to me . I 've been elbowing the crowd for the last five minutes trying to get to you . I wanted to express my compliments on your work . " Jerry thanked him . " My name is Atkins . I 'm connected with the steel mills in Birmingham . What is the nature of your position here under Dr. Blankenship . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . suppose it is , " said Jerry . " You would n't be open to wider . . . more intensive religiousopportunities ? " inquired the steel man , choosing his words carefully so they would have an uncommercial sound . Jerry gathered Mr. Atkins ' drift , and the thought of leavingthe quaint charm of Florence for the smoke and dirt and bustle of Birmingham was distasteful to him . " Colonel Vaiden , my uncle , is very desirous that I remain here in the cathedral .... " " Naturally , naturally , but the width of a minister 's field , the possibility of good that lies before him , must influence him in his decision about his work . " " That 's true , of course . " " Well , good-bye , Dr. Catlin . I wo n't hold you any longer . If I should drop you a line in care of the cathedral it would reach you , I suppose ? " " The cathedral or the Methodist parsonage . " The man drew out a little book and made a note @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Church in Birming-P207ham . Good-bye . " He touched his hat with a faint bow that included the ladies in the car , turned , and was lost in the crowd . As Jerry entered the car , the thought came to him , if Sydna 's charms made life too unhappy for him , the New Methodist Church in Birmingham might be a refuge . Sydna herself widened her eyes at her nephew-in-law and asked in concern : " Jerry , he 's not trying to get you away from Florence , is he ? " And Jerry said : " Oh , these vague suggestions from lay members seldom come to anything . " At this point Marsan broke into the conversation by ejaculating : " Oh , there 's Mr. Petrie . . . Mr. Petrie , will you ride . . . " Here she bit off her impulsive offer with a reddened face . The school teacher turned , and Sydna called pleasantly : " Marsan 's offering you a lift , Mr. Petrie . . . what did you think of the speech ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of course , that last man 's speech . . . or stammerings ... was dreadful . " " Well , I did n't think much of it , " said Petrie incisively . " To disbelieve in religion because its use is founded on fear is just about as sensible as to disbelieve in antiseptics because t heir use is founded on fear . " " Why , that is true , " ejaculated Sydna , surprised at this reasoning , " you should have got up and said that : it would have been a hundred times better than what that crazy man maid . " " As a matter of fact , I . . . was n't where I could , " answered Petrie , in some embarrassment ; " I was at the door , seeing him from there . " " Why , that 's a shame ! " cried Sydna . " The invitation committee were very stupid to keep the most intelligent listener on the outside . "   " They had to draw a line somewhere , " laughed Petrie ruefully , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To my way of thinking , " said Sydna , punching Miltiades with her gloved hand and moving him in the seat with her and Jerry so Mr. Petrie could sit by the side of Marsan , " to my way of thinking school teachers are the very designers of our society . What they believe , the next generation are going to believe . " Sydna gave to this hackneyed observation the charm of freshness , and it moved Mr. Petrie in an intimate and reproachfulmanner . He recalled Marsan 's visit to his office and her embarrassed inquiry about religion , and then later her confession to him of her relations with Red McLaughlin . What connection with each other had these two moments in Marsan 's life ? Petrie had tried within the last week to put the girl and her impudicity out of his thoughts , but her confession to him " because he was going with her " repeated itself over and over to him with its frankness and pathos . He knew very well why she had shouted out to him and then checked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had waked in his bed at the Waner boarding house in Tombigbee Street with a hope in his heart that Marsan would pick him up that morning , and then he would remember that she could not , and the day would go gray again . Marsan 's chopped-off call to him had been like that . When the car moved onward , Sydna , who saw that her daughter was not in a talkative mood , assumed the burden of the conversation . " Was n't it outrageous of that Mr. Rutledge to get up and talk as he did ? " " I think he believed it , " said Petrie gravely . " Yes , he did , but Mr. Ponniman took him down when he told him that drowning men very often had illusions like that . " " Yes , and that 's a very lawyeresque proof , " said Petrie .   " You know lawyers never use logical demonstrations : their proof is psychological . They say whatever they think will convince their hearers , even if it has n't a particle of sense to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why do you say that , Mr. Petrie ? " asked Sydna , really interested . " Why , look at Ponniman 's implication . He said other drowning men had seen the same thing , therefore it was not true . That 's about as sensible as to say if one man goes to China and comes back and reports it , China exists , but if a dozen men go to China and they all come back and report t he same thing , China does not exist . " Sydna was amazed . " Well , I declare , that 's a fact . . . but you do n't believe Mr. Rutledge went anywhere or really saw anything , do you ? " " No , I do n't , but I certainly do n't say he is mistaken because other men have seen the same thing . " Sydna had it on the tip of her tongue to say : " Mr. Petrie , I 'm surprised that a brilliant young man like you would teach in a high school , " but being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the habit of censoring , suppressing , and changing whatever she really thought . She was a lady of charm . Jerry Catlin sat by Sydna , half listening to her conversation with Petrie and distinctly aware of the slight . touch of her hip against his own . He glanced at her from time to time , thinking that she was physically and facially what she had been in her youth . ' She was a luxurious woman , the fulfillment of the promise of her girlhood . Marsan might have been her younger sister ; or rather , since Marsan was blonde and mental instead of being brunet and physical , as Sydna was , they might have been no kin to each other at all . Jerry f ried to take his mind off his seat mate . If Atkins offered him that pastorate in Birmingham , he would take it . A faint suggestion of Sydna 's perfume came to him now and then in the windy car.  | Old Colonel Vaiden sat on the other side of his wife , thinkingof Rutledge , who was almost drowned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shots fired into the water had struck a little yellow child who had been hiding below . A few minutes later , when Marsan drove up Pine Street , Jerry Catlin asked to be delivered at the parsonage . Sydna insisted that he ride on to the manor , but Jerry pleaded work and got out . Marsan then drove to the manor and delivered her father and mother . She asked Mary , the maid , for Wilson , with an unworded plan of having the chauffeur drive Mr. Petrie home . The maid said that Wilson had gone over to Jericho . " Confound that nigger ! " cried the Colonel , " I told him not to buy that lot ! " " Yes suh , Wilson tol ' me you tol ' him not to buy that lot , " declared Mary . " What do you want with Wilson , Miss Marsan ? " " To take Mr. Petrie home . " The school teacher offered at once and very firmly to walk home , but Sydna was shocked at such a suggestion . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from his home than where she found him and let him walk back . . . " that 's as bad as Mr. Ponniman 's logic , Mr. Petrie . " The mother smiled at Marsan , made a sharp private motion with her gloved fingers that told Marsan that she was amazed and embarrassedat such discourtesy in a daughter of hers . Then , with extra sweetness , she reinstated Mr. Petrie in the car and started Marsan around the loop for Pine Street . As soon as the two were behind the boxes that screened the drive , Petrie offered again in a formal voice to walk home . Marsan replied with equal formality of voice , if not of words , that she would have to drive around long enough to take him home , anyway , so she might as well actually take him home , unless he objected to riding with her . " Of course I do n't , " said the school teacher , and he almost added , " What is it to me how you comport yourself ? " butP211the last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it . " I can get you home in three minutes , " said Marsan , and she speeded up the car , south . . . west . . . and was in TombigbeeStreet . A kind of physical heaviness came over Mr. Petrie as his hoarding house was whisked into sight . In a minute or two he would step out of the car , and then he would never be alone with this girl again . Within the last week , in the privacy of his own imagina-t ion , he had conducted endless conversations with Marsan . Ile would ask : " Marsan , why did you surrender your virtue to a creature like Red McLaughlin ? What moved you to do it ? " He felt now , unless he could get some of these unhappy queries asked while he was with the girl , that they would go on revolving in his head endlessly . Her mere presence somehow allayed his feeling of prolongedsuspense and privation but substituted for it a feeling of despair . He thought of saying to her frankly : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not believe in preachers and their cant , would you have done what you did ? " He knew that if he were one tenth as frank and straightforwardas the girl he would say that . . . if he possessed just a touch of her honesty , that had come about , he supposed , because she had always been wealthy , pampered , protected , and spoiled . Only the spoiled were unreflectingly sincere . He himself was born in the lower middle class . He was still there . The car stopped in front of the old Waner place on TombigbeeStreet . " Thank you for bringing me home , Marsan . " " You 're welcome , Mr. Petrie . " That was the only voice given to the surging questions , denials , explanations that stormed through their two brains .   As Marsan turned her car , she blinked her eyes in order to see the street at all , and she cried out in her mind in a kind of spasm of anger and heartbreak : " If it had been him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ! " P213ON HER way home Marsan stopped by the parsonage in order that she apparently would have consumed a reasonable amount of time in driving Mr. Petrie to his boarding house . The parsonage was empty , and Marsan followed a walk to the rear door of the old church and looked into its great hare auditorium . She thought her cousin was in the office but did not go in because of the shock she had received from seeingthe model of her father 's tomb . She did not call Jerry because in reality she had nothing to say to him . In the office she could hear a typewriter going . The dark benches in the auditorium looked so uncomfortable that she did not nit down , but continued standing near the door . The girl had read of women going into churches and prayingwhen they were in trouble . She was not in trouble , and such a place as this offered neither the incentive nor the surroundingsfor prayer . She felt abysmally depressed . She thought how shameful it had been for Mr. Petrie to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the only man in the crowd who had the intelligence to pick that rough , shaggy coconut grater of a Yankee , Ponniman 's , speech to pieces . The only man in town with the brains to do it , and him slighted by the committee and kept outside ! Tears stung Marsan 's eyes ; her lips trembled ... she hated Mr. Petrie . . . she wanted to take his head in her hands and ... shake it . . . and . . . press it between the mounds of her breast and kiss away the wounds and slights that these damned ignorant uppety Florence society people put upon him for being a school teacher ! Still , he really did n't have any sense ! Broad-minded on religion , narrow as a string on sex . . . not many girls would have had the decency that she had and told him what had happened ... what difference did it make whether a preacher mumbled a few words over a couple or not ? Still . . . they should love . Marriage was just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water works . . . but people should love each other , and she and Red had n't done that . . . they had n't even thought about it . She was weeping again , holding her face motionless but disconsolate , with the tears running down the side of her short straight nose . She felt faintly sick , nauseated , as if further looking at this drab depressing interiormight cause her to throw up . A wing of the double front door opened , and a woman entered the auditorium . It was Miss Swartout . Marsan watched her with the automatic curiosity which one woman always feels for the actions of another when there is a man close about . Miss Swartout remained near the entrance for a moment , then moved uncertainly toward the door of the inner office . When almost there she happened to see Marsan . She gave a slight start . " I did n't know you were there , " she ejaculated , smiling and coming down the aisle to the girl . " That 's a very pretty dress you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lively speculation on what Miss Swartout had meant to do in the office and why she had started when she saw someone . Aloud she asked : " Did you hear PIr . Ponniman 's speech ? " " No-o ... I did n't go . . . Father is not a Rotarian . " This last seemed dragged out of the organist . She looked at Marsan with an odd expression in her clear blue eyes . " You . . . are waiting for someone , are n't you ? " she asked solicitously , as if she would go quickly out of the building and leave it to Marsan . " No , I 'm not waiting for anybody ... I meant to see Jerry , P215but I heard his typewriter running and knew he was busy . I 'm going myself this very moment . " With this elaborate explanation Marsan was really putting a feminine question to Miss Swartout as to what she was doing here . The organist began at once with very close connection in what seemed to be a disjointed conversation : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choir stalls on this side of the church . . . " She passed Marsan a little way and looked into the choir stalls . " The song books are n't ever kept on this side , are they ? " said Marsan . " Well . . . a person could n't see them over here , anyway , if she were crying , " said Miss Swartout . Having declared a war of suspicion on each other 's motivesand actions , they separated , with neither army able to wrest an indisputable victory on the field of battle . Marsan'sparting salvo was : " Well , good-bye , sorry I ca n't stay to hear you practise , Miss Swartout . I know you play lovely , because everybody says you do . I wish I could understand some of the things you select . " " Unless a person has a natural ear , they have to hear a lot of music , " said Miss Swartout . Marsan went out to her car and drove home . She was unreasonablyangry about Miss Swartout 's insults , forgetting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two girls had really been saying to each other Was : " You are trying to catch Cousin Jerry and you are not good enough for our family . " And Miss Swartout was replying : " My family is as good as yours , you musical ignoramus ! " At home Marsan went to her mother at once and told her with incense that that Miss Swartout was setting her cap for Cousin Jerry .   Sydna had Marsan tell precisely what she had seen and said . A sharp and completely unexpected pain entered Sydna 's heart . " She may have had some ordinary business with Jerry , honey . . . hymns to select . . . Dr. Blankenship ca n't carry a tune , and Jerry is quite musical . " " Then what made her jump if she 's not setting her cap ? " To Sydna , the suggestion that Jerry might be in love wi t I- somebody besides herself filled her with incredulity and at the same time distress . Her life and Jerry 's , she had told herself , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her home , ate many of his meals with her and the family ; his was a warm masculine affection which gave a kind of body to her life . She was interested , of course , with social work and patriotic societies . She had been regent of the Florence chapter of the United Daughters of the Confederacy and of the Daughters of the American Revolution , but these honors were like the candles on a birthday cake , inedible and told how old one was getting . Jerry Catlin really was the only intimate friend Sydna possessed . Drusilla , her mother , was the owner of a faintly satirical wisdom which always kept Sydna at a slight distance from her . Miltiades had settled into a middle course somewherebetween a father and a husband once removed . Marsanshe had never understood at all . Now and then Sydna gave her daughter a little random advice , and Marsan , in turn , gave Sydna advice not at all random in the form of opinions gleaned from her teachers , her father , with whom she was intimate , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of her own original head . When Jerry entered the parsonage he had installed himself at once as the only thoroughly comprehensible human being in Sydna 's world . Now , the mere suggestion that he might marry any woman at all filled Sydna with a desperate feeling , as if she were clinging to a life buoy in deep water and some other woman were about to snatch it from her grasp . P217Mr . Jerry Catlin , the object of Sydna Vaiden 's disturbed meditation , sat in the office of the old church checking off a list of names by placing a number after each one . At another table Miss Chisem typed form letters which corresponded to the numbers Jerry placed on his index . Most of them were begging letters , a few acknowledged the receipt of checks . M iss Chisem had a pile of such letters awaiting Jerry 's ' signature . All these form letters sounded very intimate and yet dignified , as if Jerry himself were personally grateful for the contributions in question . As Jerry absently signed these communications he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parsonage . The shock he had received from Sydna in the Vaiden motor suggested that he give up his work with the cathedral . Ile did not want to complicate his life and his mind with an unworded and impossible passion for his aunt by marriage . He would resign his position at the conference of the SouthernMethodist Church which would be held in the fall and ' a'sk reappointment somewhere else . The steel man in Birmingham , whose name had got away from Jerry , might help him . It seemed ironic to Jerry that this emotional stress should rise up in him in regard to Sydna , just when the annoyance and distraction of the rape case had cleared away and left t he moral atmosphere of Florence free for sane and spiritual I h inking . Now , if the distraction of Sydna could be cleared away , in distraction of the boom cleared away , and the distraction of the actual building of the new cathedral could be ended , 1 hen he might reach up to that inner spiritual life which had been his goal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do if he were always to be secretly tweaked by his longing for Sydna ? How could he pray ? How could he approach ' God ? Here the troubled circling of his thoughts was interrupted by the solemn prefatory chords of one of Bach 's chorales . The assistant minister arose from his desk , handed Miss Chisem what he already had signed , and entered the auditorium . For ten or fifteen minutes he sat out of sight of the organist , listening to the turbulent music of the pipes . The chords somehow spread a vast stately architecture and noble demesnes before Jerry 's mind , and the voices iii the music were the action taking place amid the scene . And while the organ created a great superhuman drama beforeJerry 's fancy , at the same time , and by a strange double effectiveness , it was an idealized recountal of Jerry 's own past life and a glorified vision of what he hoped he would yet become . It was as if the music had unchained Time 's feet upon his fatal path and allowed him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midst of a chord , the playing stopped , and the bare auditorium rearranged itself and slowly cut off the vistas the music had revealed . Miss Swartout came out and looked at Jerry with a rapt expression on her face . " I did n't know you were listening . " " You knew I was , if I was anywhere in the church . " " No , I did n't know it , because I was n't thinking of you . " Jerry was delicately amused at Miss Swartout . The idea of a woman saying a thing like that to a man . . . admit she was n't thinking of him . . . when she was n't . " What were you thinking ? " " I was thinking how sad it was that people ca n't live in the world of sound as they do in the world of light . You can hear wonderful romantic things in sound ; they are all around you , in your very heart , but how far away it all is , how inaccessible ; but in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extreme distance , and you feel you can go there and become a part of it ; yet they are both waves , one air waves , one ether waves . " She looked at him musingly for a moment . " I am sure you do n't know what you were doing in the world of sound ? "  | " Was I in it ? " " Yes , you were building a cathedral , not by gathering money , but by lifting the stones yourself , lifting huge stones and shoving them into place . . . . " She broke off again , continuingher regard of Jerry , and presently asked in a queer voice , " Are you in love with Marsan ? " Jerry was disconcerted . " Why , no . . . of course not . . . she 's my first cousin . " " Yes . . . I knew that . I was thinking of her too . When I came in she was standing over there by the choir stall , Crying .... " " Marsan was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I thought , There was Marsan , just crying and nothing more , ' but if that were in music she could die of the wounds of her love , and a musician could play the same piece over , and she would be reborn , love again , and die again , over and over . Tragic deaths in music are a kind of sweet pain because they may always be played again and are a kind of eternal life . But out in the real world of light , if you die , that ends it ; nobody will ever play again the symphony that made up you . " She became quiet , looking at Jerry out of her Dresden china eyes , then aid in apparent disconnection : " I 'm engaged . . . I told Tony Vicelli I would marry him . " Jerry was somewhat taken aback . " Well , that 's lovely . . . does he understand music ? " " Oh no , of course not . As far as I know , you are the only rson in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I had a very strange dream . " " What was it ? " " I dreamed I was about to be thrown from a great height , and a sad melancholy music was being played . And I thoughtthe music really was my death , and I listened to it in terror , End when it ended , I thought in despair , Now I 'm dead . ' " What a strange dream . " " It was , was n't it ? When I woke up I could n't quit thinkingabout it , the music stayed in my head . "  | Jerry stood pondering what she had told him . " I ) o you ever read Freud ? " he asked . " Well , no , I do n't read him , but I know about him . . . a little bit , at least . " " I was wondering , do you suppose there could be any possible connection between your dream and Tony Vicelli ? " " Why , no , I had n't thought of that at all . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Miss Swartout , I do n't believe I would marry Tony Vicelli unless I was sure I loved him . " " Well , I ... I do n't think anybody else will ever want me , Dr. Catlin . " " You still ca n't marry for mere convenience . If there was n't some profound necessity for love , why did it ever grow up in the human race ? " " So people would have children , " said the organist . " Then why is it so selective ? " argued Jerry . " If just any man can fertilize your body , why ca n't any man fertilize your heart ? And why does your heart cry out so against .. . just any man ? " " Does it cry out ? " asked Miss Swartout , frowning in thought . " I am sure so . . . what else can your dream mean ? " " I did n't know it meant anything , " said the girl , " until you said so . " She broke off suddenly to ask : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the collec-tion ? " " Why , yes , of course , why ? " " Nothing . . . I just wanted to know . " " Is there anything wrong about it ? " " Well , he thought he was going to get paid some more right away , but he did n't . " " By whom ? " " The niggers who contracted for houses in Jericho . " Jerry nodded with gravity . " Niggers are uncertain . . as a rule , they do n't pay . " " I told Father that , " exclaimed Miss Swartout ; " I toldP221him nobody trusted niggers down here in the South . He said t his time it was n't their fault , they had all been run away from their work , and they did n't have anything to pay with . " " Why did they lose their work ? " " Oh , you know , the trouble they had about the boys in jail , for one thing . Then the nigger carpenters and bricklayers and plumbers would n't join the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' em . Now they are grumbling on Grey M ale Hill that my father and everybody else is trying to rob them . " " Well , niggers grumble to themselves and grin to white people , " characterized Jerry . " Is the fifty dollars your father gave to the cathedral going to throw him seriously behind ? " Miss Swartout drew a long breath . " Well ... I do n't know . He gets mad when Mamma or I ask him about his business . He owes the Sheffield bank for he lumber and stuff that went into the houses . " Jerry ruminated a moment and finally said : " Suppose we step into the parsonage and see Dr. Blankenshipabout your father 's fifty dollars . " Miss Swartout agreed to this gratefully , and the two went together out the side door around to the parsonage . They walked in silence . About half of Jerry 's thought was on the fifty dollars ; he was also comparing almost involuntarilyMiss Swartout with Sydna . Jerry wondered if Miss Swartont was a musical genius . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in her music but in her everyday life . Then Miss Swartout not only had ideas on all manner of subjects , but she was amazingly frank and transparent in her expression . Sydna , on the other hand , was a woman whose intellectual effort was mainly to make herself agreeableto other people . Nearly all of her information was disconnectedand picked up here and there , without system and purely to entertain herself and others . Some years ago she had been a member of " study " clubs whose study programs skipped around from fortifications of the American coast to the hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle . Of late she had turned almost exclusively to patriotic societies . If she could not cultivate her intellect , she would her heart . This quality of lifelong agreeableness , adaptability , and solicitousness for others somehow had been transposed f ruin her mind to her body , and she moved about , an unconscious suggestion of tenderness , sweetness , and luxury . A tingling sensation went through Jerry at the mere thought of Sydna . He told himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was surfacy , but the fancy of possessing that surface quickened his breath . Dr. Blankenship listened with sympathy to the story of the fifty dollars . " I have sent it in , " he said , " to the building fund , and I do n't know whether it can be got back or not . The MethodistChurch is an ecclesiastical corporation , and I do n't know of any precedent for returning a gift . I can report to the board that this gift has worked a great and unexpected hardship . . . " " Oh , let it alone , " begged Miss Swartout . " Suppose Jerry make a report on it to the board and I 'll write a letter of recommendation , " proposed the Doctor . " I do n't think we 'll get it back , " said Miss Swartout unhappily . " We can hope for the best , " comforted the Doctor , patting the girl 's plump shoulder . " Jerry , you look into this . We ca n't have our organist in trouble . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to Waterloo ? " " No , what about Waterloo ? " " It seems the Methodist Church has just about lost a Sunday school in Waterloo . It 's been taken over by a flyby-nightsect called the Drownders . " " Drownders ? " " Yes , ever hear of them before ? " " Never did . " " Well , there 's a Drownder preacher over there holding a revival . It is one of those revivals that does n't stop , itP223goes on and on and on . We have n't received a cent from the Waterloo Sunday school for three consecutive Sundays . " " You do n't know the preacher 's name ? " " Two syllables , sounds something like Patridge . . . some kind of an idge ' . . . idge . . . idge . . . Rutledge ... Willie Rutledge . . . when a preacher calls himself Willie ' or ' Jimmy ' or Charley , ' you already know the kind of sermon Le will preach . "  |p224THE  assistant minister and the organist of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dubious mission of making such a report to the General Board of the M. E. Church South that it would O. K. a return of fifty dollars to its late and repentant owner , Mr. Swartout . The two drove over in Miss Swartout 's car , and as they rattled along it occurred to Jerry that if he should marry Aurelia Swartout it would be such a typical thing for a poor Methodist preacher to marry a poor music teacher and organist , and for the two to clatter around in the wife 's poor car , until in some far distant future some shamed congregationwould present them with another . And it was amazing how much shame a small town congregation will endure before it produces a second car . " What are you smiling at ? " inquired Miss Swartout . " I did n't know I was smiling . " " A sort of disgusted smile . " Jerry was glad that he had not said straightaway that he was thinking of her car : there would have been ahead of him such an involved and personal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile when I am motoringwith you , Miss Swartout . " " Do you like to motor with me ? " " Of course . " " And do you like the way I play ? " She looked at him with concerned eyes . The minister patted her hand in assurance . " Why , Miss Swartout , how could it be otherwise ? " At the pat an odd tingle traveled up Jerry 's arm , as if theP225organist had been charged with some sort of sweet electricity . Color came into Miss Swartout 's face , then flowed out again and left it quite pale . Jerry observed these physical signals in himself and the organist with a touch of surprise and self-interrogation when a newsboy came running along the downtown street of Florence shouting : " The niggers are caught ! The niggers that got away here in Florence are caught ! Read all about ketching the two niggers in New Jersey . . . . " Jerry was not averse to the interruption . He reached in his pocket and said , " Let 's get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jerry beckoned the boy to him . A two-column headline announced : NEGRO RAPIST ESCAPED FROM FLORENCEARRESTED IN PLAINFIELD , NEW JERSEY . ALAMABA GOVERNOR FORWARDS REQUISITION PAPERS . The Four Accomplices of the Escaped Negro at Athens , Alabama , Sentenced to Death . Jerry did not read the article after he had bought it . Miss Swartout had stopped her car near the Second NationalBank , and Jerry 's attention was caught by a queue of men reaching out of its door and halfway down the block . Jerry asked a man standing near if they were depositors wait ing to put their money in the bank or were they men who wanted advice from Colonel Vaiden ? The man gave a short laugh and answered : " No , they are depositors waiting to get their money out of the bank , and I suppose they are men who took advice Colonel Vaiden . " " Why , what 's the matter ? " cried Jerry , alarmed at the fellow 's irony . ' File man nodded at the queue . " You see for yourself ... @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through the assistant minister .   " Aurelia , " he said , " I 've got to go in and see what 's the matter . Do you mind waiting a minute ? " She nodded her consent , and Jerry stepped out of the car . At the door a policeman told Jerry he would have to go to the end of the line and await his turn . Jerry explained he was not a depositor , that he was going in to see his uncle . The officer moved aside and let him pass . Inside the bank all the desks in the lobby were filled will ' men writing checks . They were copying amounts from their passbooks . All the paying windows were open , and the tellers were receiving checks and pushing forth piles of bills cappedby a few coins of small change . At one of the windows a mail was saying : " I hate to damage the bank I 've been doing business with for years , but , my God , I do n't want to lose ever'thing I got . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Katie , and passed into his uncle 's private office . As Jerry entered , the Colonel was talking over the telephone . He was saying in an affectionate tone : " Darling , I do n't see how I 'm going to get off . . . . No .. . yes . . . I know I have n't been to Shiloh since the battle , and my personal feeling then was and still is that I never wanted to see the damned place again . " He listened a few moments longer , then said : " Listen , darling , here 's Jerry . . . let him go in my place . " He put his hand over the receiver and said , " You talk to her , Jerry , she 'll keep me here for the next half hour . . . make up reasons why I ca n't go to Shiloh , " and he handed the telephone to his nephew , who put it to his ear with no very definiteobject . " Jerry , " said Sydna 's voice , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm making out the list of the U.D.C. honorees . . . . " " Sydna , he 's terribly busy , and now , since there 's a run on the bank ... " " A what ? " " Oh , did n't you know that ? "   " Tell her it 's a little run . . . it does n't amount to anything , " interposed the Colonel . " Uncle Milt says it does n't amount to anything . " " What caused it ? " Jerry relayed the question to the Colonel , who said : " Fundamentally because everybody in Florence knows that real estate has been badly oversold ; they 're nervous , and when a pin drops it makes a very startling crash . " " Tell me something she 'll understand , " said Jerry . " Tell her the Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank in Sheffield closed its doors this morning , and this is a sympathetic run , and it is really about a month behind the date I set for it . " Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talked the predicted thirty minutes and wound up by asking Jerry to go to Shiloh . He said he would go . " I should think so , " said the voice over the wire ; " to leave you out would be like leaving Desdemona out of Hamlet . . . or is she in Hamlet ? . . . who is it I 'm thinking about , , anyway ? " " Sydna , " reconsidered Jerry , " I do n't know whether I can go or not . " " What , you not go ! " Her voice enveloped him and took him perforce . His reauuiningin Florence when the U.D.C. 's were holding a functionat Shiloh under Sydna 's management was inconceivable . Her warmth aroused something of the tremulous intimacy which he had felt in the car on the day of the banquet . He agreed to attend and put up the telephone . He had an impulse to go up at once and see Sydna . His uncle was talking to lam . " That paper you 've got says one of those niggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Yes . " " Which one ? " Jerry looked over his paper . " Lascome . " " Was n't Hodige ? "   " No sir . " " And the governor is going to bring this Lascome back ? " " That 's what the paper says . " " Mm  --  mm . . . I wonder whatever happened to the little yellow nigger ? " " That I could n't say , " said Jerry , not thinking very much about the matter . " I do n't believe anything happened to him . . . he made a clean dive over the bridge for such a young boy .... " " By the way , " remembered Jerry , " I 'm the one who caught that yellow boy at the depot and held him till Northrupcame back and arrested him . " The old banker stared at his nephew . " You did ? " " Yes , I did ... in a way , I started the whole hullabaloo about these niggers .... " The old Colonel shook his head . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .. . mhuh ... and you did something else at the same time .... " " What ? " " You started the run on this bank . " " How ? " " The niggers here in jail threw the niggers in Sheffield out of work and broke the Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank . It was caught on that damn fool Jericho subdivision idea . Imagine a banker with little enough sense to try to do business in any extended way with niggers ! " P229As THE Reverend Jerry Catlin walked out of the bank he was simultaneously disturbed and titivated over the feeling Sydna 's voice had brought him . It was not the moonlit , bodiless yearning he had felt for her as an adolescent , it was a man 's possessive desire for her . It titivated his body and deeply disturbed his loyalty to his uncle , and to the church , and his profession , and everything that he was or hoped to be . A little later he climbed into Miss Swartout 's shabby car with a sense of sharp relief . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lift of her full bosom beneath her blouse , the turn of her white neck , might have been a blonde anodyne against the brunet fever of Sydna in his veins . " What did you find out ? " asked Miss Swartout , with hit crest . " It 's a sympathetic run . The Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank in Sheffield closed its doors , and when any bank closes it always causes a little flurry among the others . " After a little driving Miss Swartout exclaimed : " The Farmers ' and Mechanics ' is the bank my father deals with ! " Jerry was disturbed and sympathetic . That will have its bearings on what we find out about ' Lis gift to the cathedral . His donation may turn out better than depositing his money in the bank . . . if he gets it back . " " Would n't that be poetic . . . what . . . poetic finance ? " " It would have a fairy-tale sound , " agreed Jerry thinking bow effectively he could use such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The motor was out of Florence now , approaching the  | bridge . Jerry 's thoughts left the question of Swartout 's contributionand came back to the girl at his side . She had the antiseptically clean look of a carefully groomed blonde . IIer hands on the wheel were white and symmetrical with the muscular development of a pianist . The thought of what . they could evoke gave Jerry the feeling as if the hands themselveswere music . The girl was so sensitive and so emotionallyresponsive . The dream Miss Swartout had told him in the church recurred to him and produced in Jerry a sense of pathos and incipient tragedy . He wondered whether he ought to mention the subject again , whether he ought not to tell her that her dream was a signal to her that she did not really love Tony Vicelli . Eventually he did say this to her . Miss Swartout gave her attention to the long river bridge which was so narrow it required careful driving . On the other side she said , in a gray voice : " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I mean in the sort of way you hear in some of Wagner 's things , or Tschaikowski 's . " " Do you think love is ever so idealized as that , Miss Swartout ? " The girl glanced at him . " I think you know . " " Why do you say that ? " asked Jerry interested in himself . " Your face shows it . When I see you in the pulpit , it seems to me all the serious lovely things you are saying did n't come out of the Bible at all , but out of your own life . " " Or out of the lives of people around me , " said Jerry . " I can imagine the unhappiness , the silent wasting away of , i girl as sensitive as you are , as emotional . . . " He left his half finished sentence directed against any person who would marry for any other reason than a great overwhelming passion . " Dr. Catlin , " asked the organist earnestly , " why do you suppose people almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , how divine it would be to be in the arms of aP231person you really , truly loved . Everybody knows that ; everybodyfeels it ; it sets your heart beating and stops your breath even to think of it ; but almost nobody at all lives it . The world is full of men and women who have just given up what they hoped for all their lives . . . I do n't see why things are as they are . " Jerry sat for a few moments . " The trouble is money , " he said . " Why , that is n't true , people do n't marry for money , as a rule . " " I know that ; money is the indirect cause . You see , our period of human mating has remained where it was in the Slone Age , from seventeen to twenty years old . That is the period of the greatest biological intensity and efficiency . But our technical civilization has advanced the age of efficientproductivity to about thirty or forty years old . Adolescent boys and girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one person , and the thought of anyone else fills them with repulsion . But they have to repress these lovely monogamistic desires , because at that age the boys simply ca n't make a living . The girls , on the contrary , do not have to earn livings so they marry older men who are productively efficient . The boy , when he becomes able to support a family , chooses 5 nine younger girl of an age that corresponds to the girl he once loved . In the process both men and women have been taught to love polygamously , because they have been forced Io change desire from one person to another and another . ' that 's why divorces increase with the advancing technologicalcomplexity of our modern life . It will continue until the family is pulled completely apart and our civilization dies ; then some other race of men will rise up and repeat theperformance . " Miss Swartout 's face took on a shocked pity . " Is n't that pathetic ? " " It 's the price people pay for doctors , lawyers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what they call their morals for it . And there is no way in the world for them to avoid the payment , for a really moral life can only be lived in a world where the biological and industrial ages of efficiency coincide . There is no such world in existence today . " Miss Swartout drove on in silence . Finally she said in an awed voice : " That 's why you told me not to marry for any reason except love ? " " No , I told you that out of instinct . It is what everybody 's heart tells him to do . What I have just said was an effort to analyze the advice which I had just given you . Everybody knows what to do , Miss Swartout , but not many understand why they ought to do it . " Miss Swartout looked intently at her companion ; she moistened her molded lips . " Must I try to get the man I ... would love to marry ? " " Why . . . yes-es . . . " said Jerry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have cared for someone else ? " " I could n't decide so personal a thing as that , " said theassistant minister slowly . Miss Swartout said no more but speeded up her rattling car , passed through Sheffield to Carver 's Lane and to her own home . She walked into the cottage calling her father 's name , but the little house was empty . " I think he 'll be home soon , " she said continuing her air of excitement . " We might sit here in the hall . . . or I could play for you until somebody comes . " The girl led the way to her beautiful piano , which must have taken her a long time to earn . She pulled the bench back , stepped inside , and sat down . She drew off a ring , laid it down , rubbed her fingers together . " This is the Liebestod from Tristan and Isolde , " she told him . " What you say about technology parting men and women is true of all the things that ever parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weeping . " She struck the first fateful , broken chord of the Liebestod with its premonition of pathos and tragedy . Then came theP233clanging dissonances of uncertainty , of trepidation , of the thousand fears and hopes and portents of delayed passion . Then out of this tempest of doubt arose Isolde 's love song , climbing , flung back , climbing again in sobbing heartbreaks , the passionate aching , hopeless music of the love death . Jerry 's own throat was pierced with the needle of tears . 1 I is chest , hands , arms tingled with emptiness . He saw tears running down Miss Swartout 's face . He leaned over her , put his arms around her . She lifted her childish lips to his , put her arms about his neck , and sobbed out of her convulsed and swelling bosom : " Oh , Jerry , Jerry , please love only me , please never to have loved before ! " P234IT SEEMED to Jerry Catlin that at last the long anchoritish emptiness of his life was over . When he had gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had nursed a dreamy design of leading a life of celibacy in the service of God . This passing notion had been made permanent , quite unconsciously to himself , by Sydna 's marriage to his uncle . Now , in his middle age , when his religious yearningshad become mechanized in the service of the Methodist Church , Sydna 's reappearance had suddenly stabbed him with the long emptiness of his life . This was over at last . Miss Swartout in his arms did not fill him with rapture , but with passion and a forecast of satisfaction . She was not a rainbow : she was a summer shower on a bank of dying passionflowers . Miss Swartout herself almost fainted in Jerry 's arms . She felt as she had felt when a child , when swooping out in the wide swift arc of a great swing over a high hillside : as if a strong sweet wind were blowing through her chest and loins . She wanted to pull away the hand on her breast to relieve for a moment its intolerable sweetness . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bosom . She murmured over and over amidst their kisses : " You love me ! Is it possible you really love me ? " They moved from the awkwardness of the piano bench to a chair . She walked unsteadily with his arm about her waist , and presently he drew her down in his lap . Her legs and hips and back were exquisitely sensitive to the masculine hardness of his form . To Jerry , Miss Swartout was a warm , comfortable , yield/ing , faintly perfumed girl who could make passionate music . She had the most kissable of lips . The length of her body pressed against his own filled him with comfort and with a feeling of having at last reached a resting place . She was the frankest human being he had ever known . She always interested him mentally . As many times as they had been together , she had not grown dull . No matter to what church he was assigned after Conference met , Miss Swartout 's music would help him in his ministry . It seemed to Jerry they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Can they see us through the window ? " she whispered , looking out with heavy eyes along the stretch of Carver 's Lane to where it declined into Grey Mule Hill . " When you can see outdoors , the outdoors ca n't see you , " said Jerry . " Will you always love me ? " " You know I will . . . " He hesitated for a second ; he had almost said " Sydna " ; her given name slipped him for the moment because he had almost never used it ; then he added , " Aurelia . " The girl lay against him , drawing long breaths , her bosom rising and falling . " I used to hope I would fall in love with some man who was pure and good , like Parsifal , only I did n't believe there were any . In Chicago , a girl by herself has all sorts of things happen to her . . . Jerry , my name used to be Minnie .. . 1 changed it to Aurelia myself , to put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you want to . " " Why should I do that ? " " I really am Minnie Swartout . . . you could never love Minnie Swartout , could you ? " He pinched her cheek . " The idea of you being so grave about it , sweetheart . " " You do n't care ? " " Not at all . "   Miss Swartout gave Jerry a queer look . " You do n't really love me . " " Why do you say that ? " " Why , if you had changed your name , Jerry , I would caremore than anything . Oh , it would just hurt my heart . " " Why , darling , how silly , why would it hurt your heart ? " She got up from his lap . " It just would . " " Honey , sit back down , you know I love you . " " We must go see about Papa 's fifty dollars . . . that 's what we started out to do . " " And found out that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " smiled Jerry . He got up and kissed Miss Swartout in a pleased mood . She accepted the caress gravely , lifting her lips to his . As the newly engaged pair walked out of the house in a vague search for Aurelia 's father , a motorcar came down the lane loaded with several men and two or three negroes on the running board . As they drew near it turned out to be Aurelia 's father and two white men from the Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank in Sheffield . The motor stopped , and Mr. Swartout asked if Jerry and Aurelia did not want to come along . They were on their way , he said , to look over some property in Jericho . The two accepted and entered the car , where they were introduced to a Mr. Dykes of the Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank , and a Mr. Lindsay , a real estate appraiser , and Mr. Petman , the promoter of Jericho . As Jerry found a seat he asked Mr. Petman how his little son was getting along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave Jerry a faint shake of the head to warn him not to carry the talk too far about his little son 's infirmity . Everyone in the car seemed absorbed in his own thoughts , and the black men hanging on the outside wore the frowning brows and protruding lips of negroes who are angry or in trouble .   " What did you say was the basic amount this property owed the bank ? " asked the appraiser . " Eight thousand , " returned Mr. Dykes . " With Swartout 's material and labor on top of that ? " asked the appraiser . " No , the bank has been furnishing Mr. Swartout , too . " " I see , " nodded Lindsay . " What length of time has this paper to run ? " " It 's demand paper , " said Dykes . " Demand . . . on real estate ? " " Well , yes , you see Jericho was a real estate development for colored people , and there was no way at all to forecast how its value would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , whether the tenants would be able to find work , whether they would be able to keep in work if they found it . The bank , to protect itself from all these hazards , wrote the paper on demand , with the understanding , of course , that full payment would not be demanded if everythinggot along all right . " " And now the negroes , I understand , have lost their work on account of that trial , and because they wo n't join the union , and the white men would n't work with them if they dial join the union ? " " That 's the layout for you to make your estimate upon , " nodded Mr. Dykes . Mr. Lindsay had the drooped mustache , dark eyes , thin lips , and smooth hatchet face that seem to go with appraisers . The car presently entered Jericho , a series of neat pretty cottages grouped around a large unfinished wooden building . Behind this partly constructed pile lay a large enclosure . I n the middle of this enclosure stood a small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a new mound of red clay . " There you are , " said Mr. Swartout , climbing out of the car and waving a hand , " as solid a bunch of cottages as you ever saw , Mr. Lindsay , worth every cent that went into them . " The appraiser walked up to a cottage , looked at the ground around it , at its foundation , its walls , its cornice . He went inside and tapped the dado , tried the planks with his thumb nail . After a long inspection he said to the men who were followinghim around : " These are n't nigger cabins at all , Mr. Swartout ; why did you build them like this for niggers ? " " I wanted to build good houses , " said Swartout with satisfaction ; " made no difference who was going to live in ' em . " " What did you put so much money in ' em for ? " demanded Lindsay . " That 's the minimum specifications under the generalcontract of the Realtors ' Association , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in amazement . " Why , my God , man , the minimum specification clauseis what you show to the man you are building for , it isn'twhat you read yourself ! " " Dykes , what did the bank let him sink so much money in nigger cottages for ? " " Why , hell , the boom was on , and there was such a rush of work . . . nobody dreamed he was following the minimum specifications in the nigger houses . . . did n't anywhere else . " The appraiser shook his head . " This wo n't do . . . this wo n't do at all . . . not for niggers ! " " Are n't they worth the money ? " demanded Swartout . " That 's the trouble , " explained Lindsay , " they are far too good . You 've got too much invested here to expect to get it back out of niggers . You know you only collect about three fifths of the nominal indebtedness contracted by a group of colored people . A man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his prices . " " What are we going to do about it ? " asked Dykes , with a worried face . " There is only one thing I can suggest , " said Lindsay , " let the receivers of the bank take the property over at once and try to convert it into a white settlement . "   " Ca n't do that , " said Dykes , " as two or three of these houses are bought and paid for outright . They belong to colored people , and no white person would come out here . " Lindsay stood pondering . " Then all I can suggest is for the receivers of the bank to sell the cottages to some white man who is starting a subdivisionand let him roll these cottages to where they can he used and paid for . They are built strong enough to stand the rolling ; that 's the only good feature I see about them . " The negroes who had been listening to all this now asked it pprehensively : " Boss , you ai n't gwi @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not those that are paid for , " said Dykes . " You mean we got to pay right now ? " " That 's it . " " Ai n't you gwi ' give us a li'l ' time to pay in ? " " When you default on your first payment , all the others fall due , " explained Dykes , " and besides , in Petman 's contract the amount due on the houses can be called for at any tinge . " " But we was to pay Mistuh Petman , boss . " " If the title Petman makes to you is not good and valid , you have a right to sue him personally for damages , " explainedDykes . " You should have looked and found out what sort of contract Petman had with the bank . " " Well , now , fo ' God , " mumbled the negroes to each other , " spectin ' us to read a contrack what we do n't even see , when we kai n't undahstan ' a contrack what we do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Will Mr. Swartout lose his interest in the subdivision ? " " Oh , certainly , certainly , he ate up his profits in his materialand labor . You know the labor bill has to be paid . " Jerry and Aurelia walked away from the men . Aurelia was saying hopelessly that her father was not a business wan . The two walked on into the big central enclosure while the appraiser inspected the other cottages . The slab of marble in the center of the space was a tomb- stone . On one side of the new raw grave lay a bedraggle d tricolor of cotton cloth in red , black , and orange ; worked in gilt letters on it was the legend , " Princes and Potentates of Ethiopia . " Carved so shallowly on the marble that it seemed a mere scratching was the name : PAMMY LEE SPARKMANEXALTED QUEEN P. &; P. OF E.LADY IN WAITING , KNIGHTS OF BENEVOLENCE . PAST PRESIDENT , SONS AND DAUGHTERSOF THE HELPING HAND . AGED FORTY-ONE YEARS , SIX MONTHS , THREE DAYS . The big unfinished building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a negro church and cemetery.  |p241ON  THE bus going back to the parsonage the Reverend Jerry Catlin received his first dividend on his emotional investment in Miss Swartout . He was able to look at the women and girls on the bus with almost as much detachment as he viewed the men . They were now just women , not possibilities . Some of the prettier ones he compared to Aurelia . There was one girl , a brunet , whom he considered too tall , and he would really have given her no more thought except for the fact that she and her companion , a gangling hobbledehoy , seemed very perturbed and excited about something . The two kept glancing at each other , asking mute questions wit 11 their eyebrows and answering with almost imperceptible nods . When their messages became too complicated , they whispered and giggled more or less . Here a man sitting next to Jerry tapped the paper he was reading and said that he personally did n't care what became of that damn nigger in New Jersey , and he was n't worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the trouble and continued to think of Miss Swartout . . . how talented she was , what a musician . " " That damned nigger society in the North are raising a fight against Lascome 's extradition , " explained Jerry 's Companion . " ' They have no grounds for such a fight , " observed Jerry . " Course not , but you 'll find when you hear the details theytrying to keep the nigger up there on some sort of techicality . That 's the great idyah these days , smother the lawIn technicalities . " Jerry agreed to this .   " If the people had just hung them niggers the day they started to , all this would have been over with . The labor union never would ' a ' had to drove out the nigger bricklayersand carpenters , the Farmers ' and Mechanics ' Bank would ' a ' stood up , and ever'thing would ' a ' been hunkydory . " " The negroes who bought in Jericho would n't have lost their property , " said Jerry . " An ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said the passenger . " The other banks ai n't propped up any too firm . The whole damn boom may bust any minute , all because six damn black skunks was n't lynched in time . . . damnedest worst managed business I ever heard of in my life . " Here Jerry 's conversation with the man was interrupted by the hobbledehoy getting up from beside the girl and coming back to Jerry 's seat . The youth moistened his thick puffed lips . " Are n't you Dr. Catlin ? " he asked in an embarrassed manner . Jerry said he was . " Er . . . uh . . . thank you . . . I . . . I 'll just keep my eye on you , " stammered the boy . His face flushed , he turned and went back to the girl and communicated Jerry 's identity with a faint nod . Jerry 's companion opened his eyes . " What 's he going to do to you ? " " Have no idea . " The boy and girl grew very red @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were talking about them . The bus rattled across the bridge into Florence . Passengers got out along the way , and when the conveyance had passed through the business part of town , only Jerry and the boy and girl remained in the car . The assistant minister now saw that the boy really waskeeping an eye on him . Before the bus reached the collegewhere it turns for East Florence , the youth approached Jerryagain , this time even more embarrassed than he was before . " Uh ... Dr. Catlin , " he began , " Lizzie and I would like ... uh ... for you to perform a . . . a little ceremony for us . " " Ceremony ? " " Yes . . . uh . . . we . . . we want to get married . " Illumination broke over Jerry . " Oh , that was why you were keeping an eye on me ? " He broke out laughing . The boy was relieved that the worst was over . " Yes sir . . . how much will it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl will be worth to you ? " " Oh , my goodness . . . I do n't know , " stammered the boy . " Anything you want to give me , " said Jerry . " Would two dollars and a half do ? " " Certainly . . . do your parents know you are going to be married ? " " Well . . . no-o . . . . " " Yes , they do , " put in the girl . " That 's right , they do , " nodded the boy . " Have you got a license to marry ? " " Who from ... " " Yes , we 've got one , " prompted the girl . " Porter , lie 's talking about a marriage license . We 've got a marriage license . " " Oh yes , we 've got a marriage license , " seconded Porter , " we just got it in Tuscumbia . " " Oh , then you ca n't marry in Lauderdale County at all , you 'll have to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Oh , Porter , we should have known that ! " cried the girl . " Go to the bus driver quick and see if we have to pay a returnfare to Sheffield if we do n't get off in Florence , go quick ! " Porter rushed forward to inquire about the fare . The bus stopped , and Jerry stepped off . As it started forward again , the girl leaned out of the window and called excitedly : " Do n't tell anybody , Dr. Catlin , except Marsan ! " P244Jerry was surprised at this . " You want me to tell Marsan ? " " Please , " cried the girl and drew her head back inside the window . The assistant minister walked from the station to the parsonage , amused at the boy and girl . He also wondered a little at the bride-to-be 's message to Marsan . They were friends of Marsan 's , no doubt , and she in turn would be excited when she heard of the runaway match , which it undoubtedlywas . The childishness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own involved affair with Miss Swartout . How simply these children went about their mating ... they loved each other so they ran away and married without scrip or purse . . . Jerry thought , if he and Sydna , years ago , had followed their example of innocence ! He shook his shoulders a bit and put the notion out of his mind as a faint unfaithfulness to Miss Swartout . He was very happy ; then he reflected that presently he would have to tell Sydna his good news . . . and his thoughts came to a pause . He did not believe Sydna would be hurt , but she would be pensive . She would not be , thank God , crushed as he himself had been at her marriage with his uncle . Even now , as he thought of that distant day , the assistant minister drew a short breath , and his heart sank . At the new cathedral Jerry stopped for a while to watch the workmen . He wondered if the workmen felt any joy in putting up the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wondered if they felt the poetry and the sanctity , of raising a fane in the quiet park-like street . As Jerry stood watching , Dr. Blankenship came out of the old church , went to the head carpenter , drew him aside , and began consulting with him . Presently the Doctor saw Jerry and beckoned him to him . " Jerry , " he said in a grave tone , " I have just received ap245note from the Realtors ' Association saying they wo n't be able to make their payment this month . " Jerry became concerned at once . " Do you suppose it would do any good for me to go around and see Sanborne ? " " Probably would n't . They wo n't be able to do as much in the future as they have done in the past . " The Doctor clenched his fist . " I knew we ought to have pressed on all sail while times were flourishing ! " " Well . . . we did . " " We should have done more . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of this boom , Jerry . " The assistant minister tried to cheer his principal . " I was speaking to the foreman here , " said the Doctor , " wondering if the men would work on for some agreed percentof their wages in cash and the rest on time as a debt . on the church . . . . " When the Doctor said this the foreman began shaking his head . " We 'd have to take that up with the union , Dr. Blankenship . It 's never been done , it 's never even been suggested before . Labor gets paid for its work . . . that 's why it works . " " But the church , " pressed the Doctor earnestly . The foreman shook his head and rubbed a smudge of mortarfrom the back of his hand . " I 'm afraid the men are n't much on the church , Doctor . Two or three of them have joined the Drownders , hilt they 've quit work and gone to preachin ' and singin ' , so they 're not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Have you seen Uncle Milt about this ? " " Not yet , but I 'm going to . " " He 's a lot more interested than you seem to think , Dr. Blankenship . " The first preacher walked aside with his assistant . " I believe your uncle will do a lot for us , Jerry , but he ... "   Blankenship hesitated , then visibly changed his sentence : " Is n't it queer that our church never really gets the laboring classes ? " " It 's a middle-class church , " said Jerry with a dim , nascent feeling that heaven , when finally reached , would be found populated mainly by middle-class people . The Doctor stood looking at the unsupported columns of white marble . " The Catholic Church somehow embraces the rich and the poor , the proud and the humble . . . " He broke off with a pang at the spread of the Catholic Church . Then he recurred to his original topic : " I would really rather not call on your uncle for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a very old man and of course has old-fashioned notions about churches ... which he certainly has a right to have . " " Yes , I know that , " said Jerry , thinking a little uncomfortablyof his uncle 's trade with the Doctor . " So I would n't want him to invest any great sum of money in anything he was n't in full and complete accord with , " amplified the Doctor . " That 's considerate of you . " Jerry was really surprised at this new quality in his principal . " By the way , the fifty dollars that Swartout contributed , he really could n't afford it . In fact , I think he 's a bankrupt now . " The Doctor looked his interest . " You do n't mean it ! " " Yes , he built houses that cost more than they should . He was doing it all on a credit . . . on a string , and now the receivers of the bank he was doing business with have taken them all over . " " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This contributionhe gave you , was it before or after his bankruptcy ? " " Before , of course . " " Well , that puts it in a different light . His available funds would have been absorbed by his bankruptcy anyway , would n't they ? "   " I suppose so . " " In that case , it seems to me he did n't lose anything personallyin his donation , after all . His creditor , the bank , undoubtedlylost it , but the bank is n't applying for a refund , as I understand it , and they could n't get it if they did apply , because the donation was certainly not given with fraudulent intent . " " Oh no , certainly not , " agreed Jerry , with a dampening of his hope that Mr. Swartout would find his contribution to the church like bread cast upon the water , returning to him after many days in the hour of his need . Jerry went on into the parsonage , thinking uneasily about Dr. Blankenship 's tacitly expressed opinion about the approachingend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Doctor , was primarily concerned about the cathedral , but his thoughts continually hovered about his uncle Miltiades ' fortune . His uncle was very old , and Jerry knew that he was widely involved in Florence real estate . Jerry thought how tragic it would be for his uncle , at his age , to be robbed of his life 's accumulation . Such a tragedy would be a sort of retribution for the questionable manner in which his uncle had laid the foundationof his wealth . " Heaven forbid such a thing to happen , " he thought , " the day when my uncle did that is long past . He is a changed man . He has built for himself the most honored position among the business men of North Alabama . He has given generously to the church and to every charity . . . . " Jerry walked to the parsonage anxious , apprehensive , silently enumerating to God the many virtues of his uncle Miltiades . P248AT THE parsonage a telephone message from Sydna asked Jerry to come at once to the manor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meant to tell his uncle 's wife about his betrothal to Miss Swartout , but he wanted the matter first to settle in his own mind . He almost unconsciouslyhad planned to stay away from Sydna for a few days , until he had been with Miss Swartout for a number of times , until he had kissed and fondled her , and the visual and tactile image of the girl thoroughly possessed his senses . Then he would tell Sydna the plans of his marriage . So now Jerry thought he would better telephone Sydna and make the excuse that he was very tired . Then the notion struck him to tell her of his engagement over the telephone . But he rejected this plan . He would wait until he was with her so he could see her face . He did not believe she would be hurt , because their relation , since his return to Florence , had been of the simplest and friendliest . In fact , a little glow of hope went through Jerry that Sydna would be glad for him . Her voice on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when he began his excuse about being tired , she swept it away at once and told him to hurry on over , that she was finishing her plans for the U.D.C. convocation . They were going to unveil a monument to the Fourth Alabama regiment on the battlefield , and she must go over the details with him . As that sort of planning was the natural by-product of preachers , male musicians , Y. M. C. A. secretaries and members of Congress , Jerry felt it was in the line of his duty , even if he was tired.  |p249Fifteen  minutes later he found Sydna in her own private study which she had created on the north side of the manor , further east and across the hall from that of the Colonel 's . It was also much larger and more feminine than the Colonel 's . She had sunk in the wall and hidden by a panel a deep steel vault which she believed to be fireproof on the word of the man who had installed it . In this she kept the genealogy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To accumulate this she had hired the services of a professional genealogist in Washington , D.C. , who knew nothing whateverabout North Alabama families . She had paid this genealogist five hundred dollars for the three scrolls , and when she had received them she was forced to change the names about to some extent so that her own family would fit into them . The idea back of all this was to give Marsan an unassailable right to wear three stars in the Florence chapter of the D.A.R . ' s , and Sydna was now in correspondencefor a fourth star . For a number of years Sydna had kept these precious documentsin the safety vault of the Second National , but finally they grew so bulky the bank could no longer house then , so Sydna built this fireproof vault in her own study to safeguardher treasures . Besides the genealogies of herself and her husband , Sydna was permanent custodian of the U.D.C. records , which were not small in bulk , also files containing her accounts as treasurerof two charitable organizations , a bridge club , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dozen now antiquated study and culture clubs . None of these activities had absorbed much of Sydna 's time . She had taken them on one after another in the course of her social leadership in Florence . Now , for her to call in Jerry to help her plan the U.D.C. unveiling at Shiloh was nothing new . When her nephew-in-law rang the bell and was shown up by the maid , Sydna turned from a little mahogany writing table inlaid with figures of sandalwood .   " Jerry , I 'm making out a list of persons to invite to the unveiling . " " Nell , you know I 'm a stranger in Florence . . . just arrivedhere . . . whom do you want to consult me about ? " Sydna paused with an uplifted imitation quill pen made with a pearl shaft and silver feathers . " I was thinking about asking . . . Lucius , " she said , looking at Jerry with a soft intent gaze . A kind of shock traveled through the assistant minister . " Lucius Handback ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her head and lowered her silver quill . " No , I wo n't do it . . . I did n't know how you 'd feel , Jerry . " " Oh , it is n't me ! " " I know it , dear . . . there 's no use having Lucius , any-way . " " I really think it would be very generous of you . " " No , I wo n't ask him , it was just a notion that passed through my head . . . still , I hate for him to hold against me all that trouble that sprang up between our two families so long ago . . . I thought a formal invitation , sent out with hundreds of others ... " " How would Uncle Milt feel ? " " I 'm not going to do it . . . that 's why I wanted to ask you. , , " But look here , " protested Jerry , " I 'm not saying I 'm against it . In fact , I think it 's a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is , would Lucius understand the conciliatory spirit in which you sent it ? " " Lucius is really brighter and more generous than you have ever given him credit for , Jerry . I do n't believe ministersas a rule give their congregation credit for the intelligencethey really possess . " " He 's not in my congregation . " " Oh no , I was speaking generally . " " Sydna . . . I say invite him . " " Oh , no , I would n't think of doing such a thing . " P251Jerry went over to a window seat and looked out on the park which the Baltimore landscapist had designed . " Is that all you wanted , Sydna ? " he inquired , looking at a beech whose green was touched with the bronze of autumn . " Is that all you wanted to see me about ? " " Look here , Jerry , you 're not trying to get away , are you ? " " Oh no , not at all . " " I feel as if I were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got up and came down the long room to him . " No , there 's a lot of things . . . Jerry , I was thinking of you making the introductory speech at the unveiling . . . presentingthe speaker of the day ... would you be willing to do that ? " Jerry was surprised . " Oh , Sydna . . . I could n't do that . " " Well ... all right . . . I did n't quite think you would . " bile drew a long breath , " I wish I had n't asked Mr. Brekker make the principal speech .... " " I do n't mean I would n't introduce Brekker , I mean I ould n't want to make any speech at all . " She looked at him in surprise . " No ? " " Why , no , when your father died there , Sydna , and my lather was captured there and imprisoned and starved into scurvy , when my uncle Milt and my uncle Augustus and Uncle Polycarp were all in the battle . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ utter a single word ? " " Oh , Jerry . . . no , " she exclaimed , and took his hand , oohing earnestly into his face . " Let some eloquent man like Brekker , who has felt only the general loss of the South , speak at Shiloh . " " Jerry darling , pardon me . I had n't thought of it that way at all . " She sat pressing his hand in her two palms with tears in her eyes . They continued thus , filled with tenderness for each other , tenderness for the soldiers who had gone out of the families of Catlins and Crowninshields and Vaidens in the tragic intertwined histories of their houses . There came a knock on the door of the study . The mistressof the manor took her hands away and wiped her dark eyes on a film of lace . " Come in , dear , " she called . The door opened , and Marsan entered . As she came to them Jerry noticed an unusual translucent delicacy to her complexion . " What were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " About Shiloh , " said Sydna . " Mother , " warned Marsan , " be careful you do n't start something like that at the unveiling ! " " Oh , I wo n't .... I asked Jerry to speak , and ... " " And I said I would n't , that too many of my people were in the battle . " " If you should cry . . . just a little bit , Mother , " suggestedMarsan thoughtfully , " not enough to get your eyes red , it might make a hit with the men . " " Marsan ! You do n't think I 'd cry to make a hit , as you call it ! " " Why , no , if you really tried to do it . . . you would n't make one , it 's got to . . . you know . . . just happen . " Sydna looked at Jerry hopelessly . " Did you ever hear of such a daughter ? Darling , how can you stand off like that and see me as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ takes after her grandfather , Major Crowninshield. . . he was a politician . . . by the way , Marsan , a funny thing happened to me a while ago . " " Yes , what was it , Uncle Jerry ? " " A couple with a Colbert County license came and asked me to marry them . I could n't do it , I was on the wrong side of the river . They went back by the same bus they came on . Before they left , they practically admitted they were runawaysand asked me to tell nobody but you . " Marsan became visibly agitated .   " Who were they ? " " The boy 's name was Porter . " " Of all things , " ejaculated Marsan , " that must have been Porter Lee and Lizzie Lanceford . " " Must I telephone the families ? " inquired Jerry . " No-o . . . they are in my biology class . They are the second couple who has run away and married . They seem come out all right , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he boy has a job now as a bookkeeper in the fertilizerfactory . . . . Oh , Mamma , I came up here to tell you the . Second National Bank has closed .... " " What , Marsan ! " Miarsan nodded . " Yes , it closed an hour ago . I got a telephone call . You nil Uncle Jerry crying like that when I carne in made me orget it . " P254THE casualness , the seeming indifference with which Marsan Vaiden broke to her mother the failure of the Second National Bank was really not so devoid of natural feeling as Sydna and Jerry imagined . The young girl had been much more excited by the identity of the person who had Wt. - phoned the news of the disaster than she had been by the message itself . This person was Mr. Petrie . He had said to her : " Marsan , have you heard about your father 's bank ? " And the girl was so moved by the science teacher 's voice that she had replied automatically , without paying any attention to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Petrie ? " " The doors of the Second National Bank were closed about an hour ago . " " Oh , is n't that terrible , " she had continued with her automatismas she thought swiftly , " This is a new beginning ; now he 'll call me up again for other things . " " I thought maybe you had n't heard it . " " Oh , I had n't , Mr. Petrie , I do thank you for calling and telling me . " Her voice sounded as if she could never possibly have found out the catastrophe had it not been for him . There came a silence over the wire . Marsan waited with every nerve tingling , mutely asking him to go on talking about any subject under the sun but not to leave her again in the desolate silence of weeks . After a few moments he did say formally : " I hope this wo n't affect you and your family adversely , Marsan . You certainly have my sympathy . . . Good-bye . "   " Good-bye , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She put up the receiver and stood in a kind of trance beside the telephone . She could see Mr. Petrie walking out of some telephone booth somewhere . . . he was probably downtown going about his unguessable business , and he had found out the bank 's disaster and telephoned her . And now this momentary brightness amid weeks of darkness had closed . She had nothing better left than to think of him Intently while his voice was still in her ears . She wondered why he had gone downtown . His affairs always seemed more momentous , more moving to the girl than those of anyone else . She wished she could know what they were . She wished the could help him somehow . . . or persuade her father to help him . . . she would gladly be his stenographer , sitting mute and humble at his desk , shamed because of her sin with Red McLaughlin , but loving Mr. Petrie far more than the pure girl whom he was about to marry . . . she mule a crooked and highly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the leftovers of the Victorian code . After all these fancies and wistfulnesses had passed through Marsan 's head , she recalled the relatively unimportantdetail that her father 's bank had closed , so she had gone upstairs to tell her mother and Jerry . But upstairs another force had swung Marsan out of her calculated orbit : that was Jerry 's report of the runaway match between Porter Lee and Lizzie Lanceford . These twain were near and important figures in Marsan 's world , nd their runaway match concerned her closely ; whereas the bank failure was remote and of small personal concern . Therefore , for Marsan to mention at all the bankruptcy of the Second National was quite a feat of detached and impersonalthought . Now , as she went out of the study to restore to her mother and her uncle Jerry the privacy they so obviously desired , her own thoughts returned gravitationally to Mr. Petrie . Did his message mean anything more than that he was disturbed about her father 's fortune ? What had he almost said in the silence just before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had said it . . . said it . . . said it ! And what was he doing now ? The facts about the mysterious doings of Mr. Petrie were : he had walked downtown amid the depressing excitement that the boom was over . The closing of the Second National had been the end of the boom . The street was full of desperatemen whose fortunes had vanished with the closing of the bank 's doors and who had town lots for sale . They would sell them for anything they could get : a half , a third , a fourth . And the school teacher had been filled with happinessthat he had had the foresight not to fling away his savings on boom property . He felt superior to the poor dupes who had trusted so unstable a thing as the boom . He reinforcedhis present triumph of financial prognostication with an ironclad decision that never , under any circumstances in the future , would he dabble in real estate . Here , as Petrie walked down the crowded street , a hand was laid on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man 's face was leathery and drawn , and he offered Petrie for three hundred and fifty dollars in cash the lot which the school teacher had been watching and pricing for the last five months . The president of the Realtors ' Association explained that he was giving away the lot because he knew Petrie was interested in it and that he needed a little pocket change , then he held his cheroot with his thumb and forefinger as if his yellow teeth were no longer able to cock it up , and drew a feeble puff . The school teacher laughed and held up a negative hand . " Thanks , Mr. Bradley , thanks , but I 'm not in the mar-ket . " The old man seemed hardly able to believe his ears . " But , listen , I 'm saying three hundred and fifty dollars ; that 's the lot you 've been offering me seventeen hundred for when it was two thousand , that you offered me two thousand for when it was twenty-five hundred , and one day , P257do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ? " He stood chewing the end of his cheroot , staring at the inexplicable Mr. Petrie . " You ought to jump at this , Petrie , if you 've got any money ! " " I 'm out of the market , " repeated the school teacher , fortified by the crash against all buying whatever . Mr. Bradley stood looking at this prospect who had shifted so annoyingly into a retrospect . " Look here , I offered it to you first because me and you had dickered over it and I felt like you had a kind of right to the first chance at it . I 'm going to let it go to somebody Ise , Petrie , this lot 's got to be sold . . . . " As the old man tood watching the effect of these words , he asked by way if information , " By the way , what bank do you keep youroney in , anyway ? " " Second National , " said Petrie . A change of expression came over old man Bill 's face . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mouth , and looked at it as he let the smoke drift up past his nose . " I God , you were right when you said you were out . of e market . " When the school teacher inquired into this dark saying and found out that the Second National was closed , a profoundshock went through him . Strangely enough , it was not for his own savings which had been swept away . I t was for Marsan Vaiden . The thought of the original , straightforwardMarsan losing her fortune and reduced to penury filled Petrie with the greatest anxiety . He knew the Vaiden fortune was more to Marsan than simple money : it was Marsan herself . It was the basis of her independence , herattack on life , her honesty , her impulsiveness , her odd , almost boylike charm . Marsan never paused to take a second thought because her first thoughts were all underwritten . If they went wrong on usual grounds , they functioned as being right on the unusual grounds of her father 's position and fortune . If the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | The analytic Mr. Petrie stood trembling at this danger that threatened something very dear to him . He wanted to go to Marsan and take her in his arms and tell her t lint he would try to do something if her father failed her .. . he cursed the fact that all human beings did not have wealt 11 enough to bloom out into what they really were instead of having to seep into forms already prepared for them like pseudomorphic rock . He had almost reached her home now , when he realized he could not perform any part of the gesturehe had in his heart : a school teacher , such as he . Why he was nothing , he could n't help himself ! Then it was that he had stopped in a home within a block of the Vaiden manor and had telephoned Marsan of her misfortune . He had wanted to continue the conversation with her , but being a man of great unity of purpose and fixity of design , a scientist , in fact , he had said good-bye and hung up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on him in full force that his own savings had been swept away , and that he himself , barring his next month 's salary , was penniless . And Marsan , shivering at her empty telephone , wondering where Mr. Petrie was , and what he almost had said to her ; if she had walked out on the wide piazza of the manor , she would have seen the object of her obsession passing her gate along Pine Street on his way back to town . P259MRS . RS . SYDNA VAIDEN 'S U.D.C. convocation at Shiloh was greatly disorganized by the failure of the Second National Bank , or , at least , her part of it was disorganized . In the first place , she did not now know where the money was coming from . Reunions were expensive . The old Confederatesoldiers had to be notified ; then a certain number of railroad fares had to be furnished . A corps of nurses and doctors had to be employed at each reunion to look aftere old men as they marched under their resurrected batik ags . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as boys they had double quicked , fixed bayonets , d charged was too much for their vanished strength . Mrs. Sydna Vaiden always had furnished the greaterrt of this money for the Florence chapter . Now , beforee contracted so heavy an expense , she felt that she oughtconsult her husband and ask his advice , in fact , his connt . This was very embarrassing , because she never discussedmoney with the Colonel . She drew checks , and the bank honored them . Now there was no bank on which to raw . In this predicament she asked Marsan 's advice , because Marsan kept in touch with her father , driving him to and on ' the bank and talking to him endlessly , while she , Sydna , seldom saw Miltiades except at mealtime and talked to him pally in the general conversation of the family . When Sydna placed her financial troubles before Marsan , ie daughter considered a moment , then advised her mother to go ahead and take care of the U.D.C. expenses as usual . " Why do you say that ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Well , if Daddy has crashed , he has crashed for milliom , and what you spend wo n't make any difference one way or the other . " Sydna was delighted at such a happy augury , but unfortunatelyit did not take care of her immediate needs . " I ca n't go ahead , " she pointed out ; " the bank 's closed , and there 's nothing for me to draw on . " Marsan pondered a space . " That 's a fact . . . still , I hate for you to bother Daddy right in the middle of the bankruptcy . . . he must be busy . " " What else can I do , Marsan ? " " Could n't you put it off till he comes home ? " " Marsan , the U.D.C. program is behind time right now . " " Mamma , your programs are always behind time , and they come out all right . " " Yes , I know , but if they get any further behind time they wo n't come out all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ finally she said : " Well , if you 're in that big a hurry , call him up , but , Mamma , do n't talk forever , just ask him where you are todraw money from now , and then hush . " " Why , Marsan ! " ejaculated Sydna , surprised and piqued , " I never talk much anyway ! " " Well . . . what I suggested is n't much . " With her telephone conversation countersigned by her daughter , Sydna called up Miltiades and asked him what bank she could now draw on , if any . The Colonel hesitated for several seconds , finally he said : " Darling , I had intended for you to use currency for a while . . . would it be too much trouble , carrying around bills ? " " Well , honey . . . it would seem awfully dirty . . . you know . . . everybody handling them . " " I think I can get you some very new , clean , nice bills , darling , green and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for autumn wear , do n't you ?

" " How much will you need ? " " It 's for Shiloh . I imagine I 'll spend six or eight hundred dollars . " " Your imagination is in the red ; it will be nearer twelve hundred . . . I 'll send you up twelve hundred . " " Thank you , darling , and you are going with us , are n't you ... now you are , are n't you ? " " Mamma !

" " But I simply ca n't get off , Sydna . . . not this time . " " Listen , dearest , " pleaded Sydna over the wire , " Marsan is going , of course , and what will she do down there on the battlefield . . . " " Mamma , I 'm not going , I wo n't go a step ! " " Do hush , Marsan . . . down there on the battlefield without you to take her around and show her everything , honey ? " " Well , of all things ! " cried Marsan hopelessly . Sydna waved her daughter into silence . " Hush , you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you do . " The voice of Miltiades interrupted to say :   " Listen , Sydna , I have thought of a way around that currency business . " " Yes , what is it , dear ? " " Go up in my study , look in the right-hand small drawer on top of the desk , not in the lower part , and you 'll find some checks on the Fifth National Bank of Louisville , Kentucky . . . you may use them . " " Why , thank you , dear , so much , I certainly did n't , like the idea of using bills . " " Sign my name to them and then write in brackets under my name , Mrs. Miltiades Vaiden .

" " Why , of course she 's going ; why , she would n't miss it for the world ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried Marsan . " Good-bye , and thank you again , honey , " and Sydna hung up . " Why in the world do you say you 're not going , Marsan ? " " Oh , Mamma , I do n't want to go . . . all those things are just alike . . . walking and milling around and speeches ... " " But , honey , you have to go , you know your father is depending on you . . . he 'll want to show you where his regiment was and where he charged and  --  and where my father was when he died , Marsan . " Sydna could never think of her father dying on the field of Shiloh in Colonel Miltiades Vaiden 's arms without being inexpressibly touched . Marsan knew this and respected her mother 's feelings but was bored by them . " I do n't want to go to Shiloh , " she repeated . " Honey , the trip will do you good . . . you do n't look sa. well lately . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Marsan . " A what ? " " A vacation . "   " What do you want to do ? " " Well , now , you 'll think this is silly , Mother , but I 'd like to go to Mobile for a while this winter . . . it 'll be warm down there . They say you can swim down there in the winter time ; they have oranges . . . " Sydna stared in amazement . " Marsan , what in the world are you talking about ? " " Mobile . " " You mean stay away from home . . . from your father it winter long ? " " Why , Mother , there 's no use pulling a long face over that . , iris have gone away from home before .

I came to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm going to ask Daddy . " The mother drew a hopeless breath ; then of a sudden she abbed up the receiver again . Marsan leaped at her , pushed ie receiver down .

We 'll see him together ! " " Marsan ! " cried the mother indignantly , " this is re-bellion !

" she asked in distress . " Well . . . Lizzie Lanceford and Porter Lee are going to move down there . " " How do you know they are ? " " They told me so . " " Oh , you knew they were going to run away and marry ? " " Oh , yes 'm , I knew that . " " But , Marsan , Lizzie Lanceford and Porter Lee are not in your circle at all . . . I do n't even know them . " " They 're in my circle in High School . " " I mean outside of High School . " " Well . . . I do n't know , " said Marsan thoughtfully , " when I strike up with friends in one place , I feel as if . . .

" " Why , Marsan , that 's selfish , you want everything . " They talked on for some time , half arguing , half persuading , until Marsan promised to go to Shiloh and drive the Colonel . Sydna and Jerry were going down on an excursion steamer which was carrying the Florence , the Decatur , and the Birmingham delegations . Later in the day Jerry Catlin left the manor and went to Sheffield to see Aurelia . But somehow , the musician sensed he had been with Sydna and was not at home to him . Jerry was forced to plead with her , argue , kiss her , hold her in his lap for a full three quarters of an hour before she finallyconsented to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American flag rises surprisingly on a staff high above the wild and continuous forest that lines the river . To a foreigner , unmoved by memories of the national struggle and tragedy which haunt the spot , that high waving flag might mark some military outpost in the midst of primevalwilderness . To the Southern people , coming to decoratethe graves of their remembered dead , it was elegy . On this field , where Sydna and Jerry walked , their fathers had fought , years and years before . The two men had been on opposite sides . Jerry Catlin , Senior , had been in l'rentice'sdivision of the Union Army . Sydna 's father had served under General Albert Sydney Johnston , for whom she was named . The man and woman had come ashore with the other passengers , and Sydna had made shift to escape her ladies and maids of honor to go with Jerry out on the battlefield . Everywhere on the wooded terrain stood bronze tablets giving the positions of this brigade and that regiment ; such cavalry and such artillery . Looking at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a world where time stood charmed , and each division of the two contending forces occupied for eternityevery successive position which it had won , or lost , on t hat fateful Sunday and Monday in ' sixty-two . As the two companions moved from point to point they came presently to a marker bearing the simple legend , " The Hornet 's Nest . " Sydna stopped and stood looking at the scene . Here the grass-grown indentation of an ancient **25;2732;TOOLONG log protruded from the bank and made a deep shadow half-way across the pool . I knew they ought to be lurking in that shadow . Young willows growing breast high screened the bank . I stepped up behind them and cast . No luck . My own fault . I had cast a little short , just grazingthe edge of the shadow . I bent nearer , keeping the bushes still in front of me . The water boiled as he came forward in a savage rush . An old Little Mouth . He must have weighed four pounds . I cast again , hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or I too inexpert . The fly lit again and again but never a strike to break the calm surface of the pool . I looked farther up-stream and saw what I thought was likelier water , a longer , deeper pool ; one of those that lying between a bluff and a sand bar nearly always harbor fish . I took two sizeable bass there and during the next two or three hours I fished half a dozen more pools , approaching each one with rising excitement . I had taken four bass by this time , all of them Little Mouth . I was too ignorant to realize that I was likely to take only Little Mouth that day  --  for the Little Mouth and Big Mouth inhabit different kinds of water  --  lout I hoped fervently that the luck would hold . A Big Mouth bass is all right but a three-pound Little Mouth is chicken hawk and chain lightning  --  no other fish of its size can give you a better fight . It was twelve o'clock by this time . I rested under the shade of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coffee that Mrs. Fayerlee had given me . After lunch I waded up-stream another mile , fishing half a dozen good pools on the way . I had a creelful of fine bass by this time and might have called it a clay but I was devoured by curiosity to know just how much of this likely water there was and I passed over two or three pools in my haste to find out what was around the next bend . P101The sun was going down but it was still light when I rounded the bend and came upon a pool whose image will always remain indelibly imprinted on my memory . A crest of foamy water flowing very swift struck a limestone ledge than ran clear across the creek . The high waters pouring over this miniature natural dam had hollowed out a deep pool and the ledge or rock running a little obliquely across the stream gave a twist to the current  --  it was the most beautifuleddy I have ever seen , shoe-mouth deep above and belowand the pool fully twenty feet across and over six feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the sand and for some minutes feasted my eyes on the sight  --  the likeliest water I had ever come upon . I knew they were there ! When I had a little mastered my excitement I bent Old Speck on a six-foot leader , took the rod in my teeth and crawled up to the pool . I lay down on my left side and made dry casts till I had got out about thirty feet of line and then cast to the far side of the pool . A Little Mouth struck like a flash of lightning . The fight was on . I raised myself on one elbow and played him . I dared not rise for if a Little Mouth once sees you it is all off . After a sharp fight I landed him , a two-and-a-half-pound bronze warrior . I rested a few minutes and then lying in the same position I made another cast . No luck this time . Another and still anotherand then a bass struck savagely . It was a female , larger and stronger than the first bass , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sharper fight . The next fish I hooked must have been a six-pounder . He whipped that pool to foam . I saw I could do nothing with him lying down so I gave him the butt of the rod . He snapped the leader like a pack thread . I was wet with sweat by this time and shaking with fatigue . I knew I had to rest again . I crawled back out of sight carefully , got up and walked around a bit to unlimbermyself and then went back . I got two more this time ,  | one two pounds and the other about the same size as the first two . Dark comes swiftly in the spring . I had been walking about to stretch my cramped muscles and was about to go back to the pool and repeat the same procedure that I had engaged in now half a dozen times when I suddenly realized that it had got so dark that I could hardly see . I was very tired too and had three or four miles to wade back to the mill . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to leave . I reeled in my line , unjointed my rod , put Old Speck back in the fly book and started back the three or four miles to the mill . I remember wading with hardly a glance past pools that had seemed fascinating a few hours before . The image of that perfect spot was so sharp in my memory that I could not look with interest at any other water . It seemed almost too much that I would have to wait until another Saturday rolled around before I could fish it again . I did fish it again , on the next and many successive Saturdays . I came finally to know all that water intimately  --  to this day I could make you a chart of every mile between McCaulay 's and Peacher 's Mill . I was the first man ever to cast a fly into Big West Fork , though to my friend and connectionby marriage , Gustavus Adolphus Henry , belongs the honor of first fly-fishing the reaches of upper Little West Fork  --  and I felt for it an affection I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excepting Camp Creek , beloved of my youth . I was young and comparatively unskilled in those days but I had even then an instinct for moderation . I did not dull my enjoyment of the stream with too much indulgence . I deliberatelyfished other waters , knowing that I could then gop103back to West Fork with keener relish . I did not , in those days , even disdain a little bait fishing . I had made a good many friends down on Spring Creek which flowed not two miles from Merry Point House . Old Billy Rockland , a one-gallus farmer whose house was not a stone 's throw from the bank  --  I used to fish with him often . He had one home-grown cane pole that he called Old Betsy . I knew her well . She sat in the chimney corner and took all weathers . Mildewed she was and with a great crook in her from pulling in so many fish . One day we were sitting on a drift pile in the middle of the creek fishing with soft craws . I was using @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Old Betsy . Sitting there on the same drift pile , using the same bait and with our corks not three feet apart , I had n't had a bite all afternoon while Billy had been pulling them in . " Billy , " I said suddenly , " I 'll trade poles with you . " He looked at me in astonishment . " Gi'me that rod and reel , too ? " I nodded . In silence we exchanged poles . The luck still followed Betsy . I landed a three-pound channel cat , a splendidrock bass and several Little Mouth . Billy never got a bite . Late in the afternoon he could n't stand it any longer . " P'fessor , " he said throatily , " I 'm a poor man and Betsy 's the best thing I got . You give her back . " I handed the cane pole over . During the next two hours I caught nothing while Billy landed two more channel cat and one fine Little Mouth . Neither of us could understand it but we agreed as we parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was another one-gallus friend he reminded me of Mr. Jones in his insistence on careful preparation and the observance of signs , the best sucker fisherman on that creek . I am ashamed that I can not at this date recall his name , but I see his face , the way it looked that afternoon in May . Hep104had started in baiting the hole in February as was his custom . A peck of corn , then two weeks afterward a half peck of wheat , then corn-bread dropped in every day  --  I used to accuse him of having his wife make apple dumplings for the crowning bait . He had sent me word by the grapevine telegraphthat the hole was finally baited and I had ridden down to the creek that afternoon as soon as school was out . His one-room cabin was perched right on the bank . As I topped the hill I heard the sound of voices raised . He was down at the hole and his wife was standing in the cabin door , her hands on her hips , giving him what-for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fence needed mending , there was not a stick of stove wood cut and here he was fixing to spend a whole afternoon fishing with Teacher . The old man down on his knees preparing his fishing tackle with hands that trembled with eagerness suddenly raised his head and began to speak . He was slower in getting into action than she was . I can not remember his opening words but the peroration has stayed in my mind : " M'ria , I thought you 'd been married to me long enough to know that when the moon is right and the signs is right and the water is right and the wind is right I 'm a-goin ' fishin ' in spite of hell and high water . You go in and bile them beans or I 'll come up thar and slap half your face off . " There was John Garland , too , with whom I liked to fish as well as any man I 've ever known . A strong , silent giant of a man who would go through the hardest day 's fishing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oath . His silence was the result of preoccupation , not sullenness . When he did speak it was to the point and he was possessed of an even courtesy . My conscience smites me when I1 The sign of the Zodiac , which for fishermen is Pisces . Possibly not more than once in a century are all four elements , wind , water , moon , and sign , in conjunction , and fishing is perfect . I remember its happeningonce in my life time.  |p105recall  that I used to take advantage of this very courtesy . We waded Spring Creek together , he taking one side , I the other . " Which side ' 11 you take ? " John would ask and I 'd always choose the side with the sun in my face and then keep punctiliously a hundred feet ahead of him . He had a poor opinion of his own skill but he knew that he always caught more fish than I did when we were fishing with live bait and he could never understand why I could double discounthim when we were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back and the shadow of his rod and line falling continuously on the water he frightened every bass to its cover . IvGYGES , TRECHO , AND THE GREENER4 In the spring of 1890 Molly and I were married . The ceremony was performed in the parlor at Merry Point in the presence of a good many relatives . Old Mr. Ferguson tied the knot , looking very grim . Indeed , in my memories of that day a general note of grimness seemed to be struck everywhere . I suppose it was because of the bride 's extreme youth but at the time I could n't help feeling that it was because I was " no kin . " One elderly cousin said as much frankly and as a matter of fact Molly was the first to marry outside of the enormous family connection . Perhaps it took more resolutionon her part than I was aware of at the time . I was too excited to think of anybody but myself , though at the moment of the ceremony I was a little cast down by an interviewI had had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up from Woodstock to see " this here man Miss Molly 's gwine to marry . " I can see him now sitting on the steps , his hound dog at his feet . He has just tucked away the dollar I have given him and speaks ruminatively : " Maury . . . I never heerd the name before . " In desperation I recited other patronyms of my connection . It was not until I uttered the name Morris that he looked up shrewdly : " Old Creek Tom ? " I recalled that when I was a child there was still living an aged  --  and he must have been wealthy  --  curmudgeon who was called Creek Tom Morris because he lived on the banks of Taylor 's creek . When I claimed him as my great-grandfather ,  |p110though  he was in reality my great-uncle , Old Jim arose and extending his hand wished us much happiness . Joys , like sorrows , come not single spies . It was in the first year of our marriage that I acquired Gyges whose historyrather than my own must occupy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had the finest bird dogs in that part of the country  --  he bred and trained the famous Pride of the South , one of the greatest field dogs of all time . One day he came to me with what he called a proposition . " Look here , " he said , " I 've got a little bitch out at my place . Prettiest thing you ever saw and bred in the purple but the train cut one of her legs off . She 's with pup now to Pride . If you 'll take her and raise the pups I 'll give you the poorest one in the litter . " " Man , " I said , " I could n't hunt a three-legged dog . " " She 'll beat anything on four legs in this country . She 'll beat anything you can buy . " There may have been a slight emphasis on the " you . " I thought perhaps he was right and I went out to Emerald Hill to take a look at the bitch . It was one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in January . The Llewellyn bitch lay snoring in a spot of sun on the drive . She was little , all right , and her right fore foot had been severed just above the dew claw . She had a beautiful , deep chest and I liked her hindquarters . As we approached she lifted her head and looked at us . I knew I had to have her . The countryman 's trading instinct rose in me . I was about to make some deprecating remark , to say that after all huntingwith a three-legged ( log would not be much sport , when I was overcome by the fear that Pat would go back on the trade . He had turned and was sauntering on toward the house . I hurried after him . " I 'll take her , " I said shortly . He seemed pleased and said that he would send her out to Merry Point some time during the week . I was panic/stricken then for fear I 'd never get her . " No , " I said , " if I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her now . " He looked surprised but he called a nigger and had her put in the buggy . In a few minutes I was driving out the Peacher 's Mill road with May 's head resting against my knee . I hunted her all that season . She was the fastest dog I ever saw and had a wonderful nose . Quartered her ground beautifully and had plenty of bird sense . The pups came . Four of them were fine but the runt looked as if he would n't live . I knew he was my dog and I set out to do all I could for him . Half a dozen times a day I 'd fight the others off and hold him to the teat to be sure that he got enough to eat . He survived and flourished but he was always very small . I named him Gyges after the mythical hero who could disappearat will by rubbing his ring . When he was four months old the dove season opened . I started training him at once . I had a salt lick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an old rail fence  --  and I 'd lie there and shoot them as they came in . Gy was so little he could hardly get over the rail but he 'd retrieve every bird . He was a greedy little rascal , as though he knew he had to eat a lot to amount to anything at all . I began giving him the heads . Pretty soon he was retrieving every bird by the head . The days went by , one after another , August had come and gone . But there was still September to be got through and October . It seemed a long time to wait ... . It was while I was training Gy that I made another acquisition  --  the best gun I ever had . That , too , came to me from Pat Henry . I found it in Sid More 's gunshop , standing in a corner with two other breech-loaders . I saw the rosewood stock first and I picked it up just for the pleasureII2 Aleck Maury , Sportsman I Gyges , Trecho , and the Greener 113p112of handling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back to me . I stood there and examined the gun . It was fourteen gauge , thirty inches long and weighed six and three quarters pounds . My first reaction was pleasure in its lightness . You could hold it in your hand and shoot it like a pistol . Next I examined the platinum ventholes . Then I saw the beautifulcontrivances to carry caps in . " Where 'd you get this Greener , Sid ? " I asked . Without turning around he replied that it belonged to Colonel Henry . He had bought one of the new breech-loadersand had told him to sell the Greener . He did n't know what Pat was thinking about . The Greener was a better gun any day . He added that it had been made in London to Pat 's order and had cost a hundred and fifty dollars in gold . I set the gun down in its corner . We talked for a few minutesabout other matters , then I went back and picked it up again . " I 'll give you twenty dollars for it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up his spectacles and stared first at me and then at the gun . " He told me to get whatever I could for it , " he said slowly , then grinned . " You better take it , Professor . You 'll never get a better gun . " I walked out of the shop carrying the Greener . I had eleven miles to drive but I got home that afternoon  --  in Decemberit was , the last of the season  --  early enough to take the gun out . I carried a cut-off powder flask and a double shot pouch , cut off . I found I could load that gun , walking along , both barrels , almost as fast as any man could break a breech-loader and load it . I flushed two coveys that afternoonon the edge of the woods and I bagged nine birds . I 've ' never seen birds cleaner shot . We found later that you could always tell the bodies of the birds killed with the breech-loader than with the Greener.  |p113whether  a bird had been shot with the Greener @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acquired the Greener in the days before smokeless powder came in , but I found later that it shot smokeless powderperfectly . I did n't have to clean it but once a season either . At the beginning of the season when the birds were young I 'd get them usually in the head or wing . Three out of five birds would tower . As the season progressed I changed to No. 8 and wound up with three drachms of powderand an ounce of No. 7 shot . Three times in my life , using that Greener I 've killed twenty-six birds out of twentyfourshots . I must anticipate my story to tell of its fate . I shot it for ten or fifteen years before a hole came in the right-hand barrel  --  a man naturally shoots the right-hand barrel oftener than the left . Sid put a beautiful patch on the hole for me . The gun was as good as new  --  I might have gone on shootingit as long as I was able to carry a gun  --  but one day I was fool enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good farmer but a poor shot . He set the gun down in the cellar near a cask of vinegar . Some drops of vinegar fell on that beautiful barrel . . . . He brought it back to me rusted . I took it out in the garden and buried it . Even to this day melancholy steals over me when I think of its fate . T could not ask better of life than to be walking again over the fields that lie between the Tink woods and Merry Point house , the Greener resting in the crook of my arm , Gy quarteringthe field ahead of me . In the early morning of November 15 , 18- , I might have been seen riding along the mile of red road that lay between Woodstock and Merry Point . At the Woodstock gate I halted and emitted a whistle . A few minutes later Jim camep114riding down the cedar-bordered drive . It was still so dark that we could hardly distinguish each other 's faces . We had ridden another quarter of a mile before Jim asked : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next breath : " What in the devil is that you 've got in front ofyou ? " It was Gy , a little nervous but quite tractable . I pulled his silky ear while I informed Jim that he was not yet six months old and I did not propose to have him run his legs off before he got a chance to show what he could do . He laughed and said good-naturedly that he would never amount to anything if I coddled him . We rode on , turned left at right angles into the lane that marks the southern boundary of Woodstock and entered a field covered with sedge grass . We were going to hunt on Eupedon land that day . I had been out several days before and had located four coveys in that vicinity . I write four coveys and am saddened to mark the progress of time . You would do well to flush one there now in an afternoon . Perhaps there are none . Progressive farming does not leave cover for birds . But on this afternoon in November @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having a good afternoon 's sport . My thoughts were all on Gy . I put down and thought that perhaps I had made a mistake . After all I ought to have waited another week , a few more days anyhow . He was only six months old . A dog can be ruined on his first clay . . . But he had already slipped away from me and was off like a shot . In a few minutes he had caught a scent . There was no putting his nose down . Wheeling at a sharp right angle he set off , quartering his ground magnificently . There was a whistle from Jim . " Lord , man , he 's got the old bitch 's action ! " " Yes , " I said excitedly . " Look there , Jim ! "  |p115He  had frozen , the little fellow , in grass so high that you could just make out the top of his head . I gave him the word to go on . He was off intelligently but there were no birds . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I was perplexed for a few minutes , then I saw what was the matter . He was winding them and would come to a point whenever he caught the slightest scent . On the third point I heard them cheeping in the grass . It is the killing of birds over a dog that makes him . Above all things I wanted him to kill a bird on his first point . With a prayer in my heart to all the sylvan gods at once , I sent him in . I could still hear the birds cheeping . . . . A fine covey .... I was taking every chance . They would get up in two bunches , the larger around the boss cock and the smaller about his lieutenant ... . I had called the turn . They were rising , twelve in one bunch and sixteen in the other . I singled out the middle bird of the larger bunch , dropped him with two others . I was so excited I did not fire the other barrel but called at once to Gy to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bird and retrieved it by the head . I gave him the head . Then I said again , " Dead , dead . . . . " He looked up at me . I knew what he would have said : " Man  --  God , you 've got the bird and I 've got the head . What more do you want ? " " Dead , " I said more firmly , " dead , dead . . . . " He was going in again . He had found the second bird . I gave him the head and he ate it . When I said " Dead " the third time he was off like a flash . . . . The day wore on . We had bagged fifteen birds out of three coveys . Gy was as eager as ever . But T did n't want to let him get tired . We turned our horses out to graze and lay down in the shadow of a hedge . Our sandwiches eaten and the cold coffee drunk , we lay back relaxed , our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day he 'd had in Arkansashunting deer . I listened , my eyes straying now and then to Gy who lay a curled up , black ball in the yellow grass . Being black and so small he would always be hard to find . He was going to be a far ranger too . I could see that already . I recalled another smaller dog Julian and I had had who would make a stand and then if you did n't come to him would keep coming back to you , when he 'd go back and take his stand . I could train Gy to do that . Tomorrow I would go on teaching him to hunt dead . I would be patient and rigorous , never say " Dead " unless I was dead sure I 'd killed a bird . I had a good season with Gy that year . The next fall I did not hunt much . We were expecting a baby in November , and as the time approached I did not like to be away from Molly . It did not occur to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time came . I only knew that now I could not go off to hunt or fish a whole Saturday as I had always ( lone before . At the same time it seemed strange to be sitting around the house those wonderful fall days . Molly used to go upstairs to rest immediately after dinner . It was then that I got most restless . I would sit on the porch reading as long as I could stand it , then take my gun and walk about in the yard . Crows would be flying back and forth from the fields . I would sit on the top rail of the fence , taking an occasional shot at them , or sometimes I merely sat there watching them circle about the big elm tree . When I think of that period of my life it comes back to me mingled with their hoarse , incessant cawing . There was a phrase that used to be often on my father 's lips when I was a child . " Hostages to fortune , " he wouldp117say , looking around the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has given hostages to fortune .... " I do not think my father 's life or character would have been very different if he had never had any children or even if he had remained unmarried . Still the phrase when I came to know what it meant impressed me deeply . Dedunt obsides , one read it in Caesar 's Gallic Wars and knew that the conflict from then on took a different turn . And the same thing must happen in a man 's life . Well , it had happened now to me . There are times in every man 's life when he does not seem to be living , when every faculty is held in suspension while he waits for events to shape themselves . It was like that with me , those last few weeks . I could not follow any of my usual pursuits . I could not even think with my own mind . I could only wait and wish it were over . Gy did n't know what to make of it . At first he plunged about me with sharp , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my senses . When these tactics failed he subsidedand retired sadly to a place he had scooped out for himself between the roots of the big sugar tree . He would lie there for hours , head dignifiedly erect , sad eyes fixed on my face . If I got up or made any sign of going to the back hall where my hunting coat hung he would spring forward then go dejectedly back to his place under the tree . Mrs. Fayerlee did not know what to make of it either . The truth was , my continual presence around the house was making the good lady nervous . One afternoon she came out and sat down in the rocker opposite me . It was a fine day , she said , true Indian summer . I agreed that it was . " Well , why' n't you out hunting ? " she asked suddenly . I said that I thought I 'd better stay with Molly . Mrs. Fayerlee began rocking briskly . " I just looked in on Molly , " she said , " and she 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at me , her head on one side . " Professor Maury , " she said and there was a faint tinge of sarcasm in her tone , " do you think there is anything you could do to help Molly ? " I replied hastily that I was well aware that there was n't . At the same time I thought it best to be within call ... . She broke in upon my explanations with a curt wave of the hand . " Go on , " she said , " get your gun . . . . " She had got up and was standing in front of me , her hands twitching at the sides of her skirt . I had a fancy that in a moment she would be shooing me out of the house as I had seen her shoo recalcitrant cats and dogs . I got up hurriedly , went into the back hall and put on my hunting coat and got down my gun . Gy had seen me disappear into the hall . He was at the back door as soon as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out into the north field . I had been out in this field two weeks ago and had got up two or three coveys but it was better now than it had been that day . There had been one or two killing frosts since then . The weeds were all dead , only the sedge grass stood erect in the field , ideal cover for birds , and to the north the woods toward which the birds would feed during the day . Gy was already ranging . I stooped to load the Greener . With a cut-off powder flask and a cut-off shot pouch it was the work of a few seconds . The caps were on , pressed down , and the gun at half-cock when I looked up and saw him walking skip-legged , and knew he had the scent . ( I never saw him put his nose to the ground in my life , even to hunt " dead . " ) He was drawn up now , stiff as a stick , pointing . I stole forward and sent him in . They rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ middle bird of the larger bunch and dropped him , then got another with the second barrel . In fact , as so often happened , we got three that time . Gyp119had one fault I was never able to break him of . As soon as he got the good scent he pointed . Then when you came up he would break his point and work his way around to windward so as to get the good scent again . We were thus both working around and when I flushed the birds nine times out of ten they 'd fly straight over Gy . It happened that way this time . He went straight up in the air and got his bird . it got away from him and he was off like a streak to retrieve it  --  he always retrieved his bird first . I watched him come up , his black lips grinning over the brown bird and stretched out my hand to take it from him . But I was too slow or perhaps it was that he was so tender mouthed  --  the bird flew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again after him  --  this had happened many times before and usually I raised my gun in time to kill his bird but today I just stood there watching until he came boundingback , looking rather cheap . I spoke then , putting all the ridicule I could in my voice : " You reckon you ever going to learn ? " He looked still cheaper and wagged his tail placatingly but be liked to stand and take reproof as little as any other dog and in a few minutes he was off again , this time quartering a wider territory . I knew from the way the covey I had just flushed flew that they had never been shot into before and that when they lit they would not withhold their scent but would go on feeding , so I never bothered to mark them down . Gy would do that . He was unfailing . When I came to the edge of the next cover he came down on a single bird as I had expected . But two got up , together . I was so taken aback @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first bird but missed the other as I thought clean . Gy had retrieved the dead bird and was off again . In a few minutes to my Surprise he came back with the second bird which was not dead but wounded . I have seen him retrieve these woundedp119birds many a time and it always surprised me . I could understand how he would notice that a bird 's wing was broken or a leg dangling , but how he could always tell when a bird had shot in his body was beyond me . I killed six or seven birds out of that covey , then started another one . This time I ran into trouble . Gy made a dead point , he did n't break it even to get the wind . I walked up . There were no birds to be seen . I looked at Gy ; he remained as immobile as a statue . I gave him the word and he quarteredrapidly and came to another dead point . But there were no birds in this tussock either . When he had done this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to consider and suddenly knew what the trouble was . We had run into a covey of Mexican quail , or rather the hybrid which has been developed from the crossing of the Mexican quail on our native bob white . These hybrid birds will not lie for a dog and depend for their getaway on their legs rather than their wings . It is the hardest thing in the world to flush them until they get within easy distance of the woods . They will rise then and every single bird will light in a tree . I watched them now winging their way to the hickory thicket and then looked down at Gy . He was absolutely baffled by this new development . I felt sorry for him but these birds have been the bafflement of many a good dog , and Gy , I knew , would be up against the same unlooked-for flight many a time in his career . By this time I had arrived at the edge of the woods . There was a hickory stump near by and I sat down on it to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had changed . Soon the birds would leave the feeding ground and fly to their roost , ing-place for the night . In the meantime I could go on and bag a few more but it was pleasant to sit here on the edge of the woods in the fading light . I looked off over the fields , picking out landmarks here and there : the slanting redp121roofs of Cloverlands , the black blur that was the schoolhouse under its shading elms . It was four years since I had stood on this same spot with Mr. Fayerlee and picked out these same landmarks . It seemed a long time in one way , in anothera period not to be measured by time . It was as if I had always lived here . I tried to picture my life before coming to Merry Point and evoked images but they had no realityto them . I had had letters from my father and my sisters , or rather Molly had for soon after our marriage she had taken over the duty of the correspondence . I read the letters when they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to be helped up on his horse for his daily ride , or that my sister , Patty , had given birth to a little boy , but the child 's birth and my father 's rheumatism alike made no impression on me . It was hard enough for me to remember that Patty was married , much less that she now had two children , and my father for me remained always tall , dark , and middle-aged and quite able to mount his own horse . I had had one letter from Julian since I 'd been here in the West . He was never very apt at expressing himself . The letter had been a crabbed statement of fact . His mother was not very well , confined to a wheel chair , in fact , but " was still cheerful . " She had greatly appreciated a letter I had written her when I first came out to Kentucky and often expressed the hope that I was doing well . He himself had opened a realestateoffice in Charlottesville , and so far was doing a fairly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Richmond . . . . I recalled uneasily that I had never answered the letter though I had fully intended doing so . The red tip of the sun that had showed behind the woods was gone now but the illumination still lingered . The spreadingbranches of the oak tree in the middle of the field stood out in it , each leaf , as it were , tipped in red light . Therep122was a field at Grassdale that had an oak tree growing in the middle of it like that . There had been a half circle of woods about the field , too , just as there was here . Julian and I often crossed that field , going home at dusk , Old Whiskey at our heels , our pockets stuffed with the squirrels we had shot . It was strange that I had never been able to answer Julian 's letter and yet I could see him so clearly striding across that field in this same sort of fading light , could hear him laugh as we neared home and he gave the call that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I stooped and picked up my gun . Gy got to his feet and we started home . I walked slowly , looking about me . There is a time , it comes in the very early morning or just as the day is sinking toward night , when every natural object is revealed , as if for the first time that day . The world seems to belong to a man more wholly then ; it is all there ; and touch and sight and sound take on new meaning . So as I walked along in the sinking light I looked about me , observing each object as if I had never seen it before . Gy thrusting his head out from a tussock of grass regarded me with amber eyes , the blades of sedge grass grew fine and feathery at the tip in a way I had never noticed before and the leaves that fluttered down from the gum tree in the fence-corner were incrediblyvariegated : pale mauve , clear scarlet , one leaf of a strange bluish color shot with purple . We arrived at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my gun resting on the rail when the bell from the house began tolling . I heard it and for a moment could not tell what it meant . Then I knew and started running toward the house . There were two fields and the strip of woodland between me and the house . I had started along the road but I veeredp123now and struck across the plowed ground . The clods , broken only the day before , impeded my progress . I began to wish I had stuck to the road . Gy , loping beside me , got between my legs and threw me to the ground . I cursed at him and struck him with the butt of my gun . At the fence I stopped to set the gun down , then vaulted the fence and ran on toward the house . In the yard a little negro boy still stood pulling at the bell rope . I could hear it ringing after I got in the house . There was no one on the porch , but in the lower hall Mr. Fayerlee was standing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hurried on up . The door to our room was shut . I opened it softly and stepped in and thought for a moment that I had got into the wrong room . They had drawn the blinds and had pushed the bed away from its original positionback into a corner . And it was not , somehow , the bed I had slept on last night . I did not recognize Mrs. Fayerlee'sown high-posted walnut bed , its feather mattress superimposedupon other mattresses so that the white counterpanethat covered it was on a level with my chest . I approachedand thought for a moment that the bed was empty . Then I saw Molly in the far corner . She lay on her side , in an attitude that was characteristic of late , her cheek pillowed on her cupped palms , her knees drawn up under her . Her eyes were shut but I did not think she was sleeping . I went around to the other side of the bed and gently took hold of her wrist . " Molly , " I said , " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answer , did not open her eyes . I bent andgently lifted her arm aside . Her face , under the tangle ofhair , was deathly pale , and I thought I had never seen eyesso tightly closed . They seemed to be glued to her cheek . Ik her wrist up again and held it while I counted thets . They were distinct and regular but it seemed to me that her breathing had grown harsher and more labored in the little time I had been in the room . I stood there listening to her breathing and I seemed more alone than I had ever been before in my life . This strange sleep frightened me and yet I would not let myself take accountof it . All my faculties were trained toward the door . It must open , I thought , any minute and somebody would come , somebody who would tell me that Molly was not dying . Once I left the bed and took a few steps toward the door with the half-formed idea of going for help . It was then that Molly sat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I ran back to her and put my arms about her and tried to get her to lay her head on my shoulder , but she pushed me aside and flung herself wildly from side to side on the bed . All the time the appalling groans kept bursting from her lips . As each one came I thought it must be the last , that I myself could not live to hear her groan again like that , then would come a blessed interval in which she lay quiet as I had found her , and then the paroxysms again . I do not know whether I cried for help . It seemed a long time before there were steps in the hall and Mrs. Fayerlee entered , followed by Aunt Maria and a younger negro woman . She came in as briskly as usual , speaking composedly : " The old fool let the kettle boil dry just when we 're likely to need it any minute . . . . M'ria , let 's get some light in here . . . " She went briskly to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who had been lying spent , raised herself and screamed , lightly , inhumanly . I had heard a horse , trapped by high water , scream like that once before drowning . I got up from where I had been kneeling beside the bed ' . " The doctor , " I said . " For God 's sake . . . ca n't he do any-thing ? " Mrs. Fayerlee 's hand fell on my shoulder but it was notp125for reassurance . She had pushed me away and was bending over the bed and swiftly stripping off the covers . She moved with desperate haste yet all the time she was making the soft , crooning sound that one makes to a child : " Yes , honey , it 's all right . . . . Mama 's here . . . . " Suddenly she straightened up . Old Maria on the other side of the bed let out a sharp ejaculation : " The po ' child . . . oh , the po ' child . . . . Lord Jesus ! " Mrs. Fayerlee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . " Aleck , " she said sharply , " you go downstairs and see if the doctor 's coming . " I went blindly down the stairs and into the front yard . Old Mr. Ferguson , in his favorite armchair , looked up as I came out . He did not speak but he withheld his eyes from his book for several minutes and solemnly nodded his head up and down . I remember standing on the steps and trying to light a cigarette but the match fell from my trembling fingers and lay flaring in the flower bed beside the steps . Mr. Fayerlee who had been walking up and down under the trees paused in his rounds long enough to set his foot upon it precisely , then walked on . I stood on the steps and looked down the road . Once I thought I saw the cloud of dust which should accompany the doctor 's buggy but it turned out to be a little negro boy stomping along in play . I remember thinking as I stood there that , now that you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were going on all the time . I wished that Mrs. Fayerlee would let me back into the room with Molly . Mr. Fayerlee was still walking back and forth under the trees . I took a path that bisected his . As we passed each other he spoke once or twice : " I sent Ed more'n an houro . . . on Dolly . . . . He 's had plenty of time to getre . . . . " Once he groaned : " Doctor Simmons , he 's so fat . ... You ca n't hurry him ... "  |p126It  was Mr. Ferguson who suddenly put down his book and rising came to the edge of the porch . " Here he is now , " he said calmly . Doctor Simmons was hitching his horse at the rack . I ran to meet him , accompanied his slow , middle-aged steps over the lawn . As we stepped up on the porch Mrs. Fayerlee was standing in the doorway . She was pale and the lines about her mouth were deep-carved but her head had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then spoke to me : " You can come up now and see the baby . " We sat down at eight o'clock to a belated supper . The doctor was still with us . The poor man had stayed because he liked nothing better than a long talk with Mr. Fayerlee ; they had been in the Seventh Kentucky together and one , I forget which , had carried the other wounded off the field at Corinth . I do not think the doctor , however , had realized what he would have to put up with from Mrs. Fayerlee . I can see her now sitting at the foot of the table that warm night in Indian summer , her sleeves rolled up , a checked apron still tied over her black house dress . Perspiration from her recent exertions glistened on her forehead but there was a glint of triumph in her eye . Her elation and selfgratulationshowed itself chiefly in her treatment of the doctor . She pressed this or that dish upon him with exaggerated courtesy and addressed him throughout the meal with the honeyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ particularlybright child . The good doctor , puzzled and slightly irritated , tried to set things right by showing great concern for his patient now that he was here , and lumbered up the stairs every fifteen minutes . Mrs. Fayerlee when she saw him starting up wouldp127dash on ahead and in a few minutes shoo him out of the room with exactly the same brisk finality that she used towards Mr. Fayerlee and me . Mr. Fayerlee , now that our anxieties were over , was disposed to be amused by the proceedings . Once he looked over at me with a twinkle in his eye and observed that he believed Sally would be glad if a baby were born on the place every day . I , however , was not inclined to merriment at Mrs. Fayerlee'sexpense . She seemed on that night no ordinary being ; I was convinced that her capabilities were far greater than the doctor 's and I was concerned only with doing exactly what she told me to do . When she bade me go upstairs I went and stood , for the exact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It may have been that Mrs. Fayerlee in allowing me so little time with Molly was being kinder than I realized . Molly looked whiter and more spent than I had expected her to and I was seized with fresh alarm until Mrs. Fayerlee coming up just then reassured me . Molly was doing very well , very well indeed ; the only thing was not to let a lot of people come in and excite her . I held Molly 's hand  --  it comforted me a little to find that it was warm now , not cold as it had been an hour ago  --  and went obediently from the room . It was only after I got downstairs again that I realized that I had hardly seen the baby ! Mrs. Fayerlee , the doctor , Aunt Maria , all assured me that he was a very fine baby , indeed , blue-eyed , fat as butter , healthy in every respect . I held him in my arms the next horning and thought him no smaller and no redder than I bad expected him to be . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never held a new-born baby in my arms beorebut I had seen plenty of new-born things , colts , calves , by rabbits , young foxes ; they stagger to their feet the first day and look about them . But this little creature 's gaze was deep and withdrawn ; he seemed to be fathoms deep in sleep.  | I had never realized before with what reluctance a human . soul faces this world and I was fascinated and at the same time troubled by the baby 's blank , dreaming gaze . In my ignorance I underwent a good deal of anxiety about the baby in the next four months . Mrs. Fayerlee , the doctor , Aunt Maria , all the experts seemed quite satisfied with him and I knew he was a fine baby physically . As the days went on , however , and that deep , dreaming look did not fade from his eyes I kept thinking that he might not be normal mentally . I said nothing to Molly about my fears , of course , but I used to go in several @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . One day Molly was busy in the next room and asked me to watch the baby for a few minutes . I was sitting by his crib fascinated as usual by what seemed to me his inhumanly blank stare . As I bent over to rearrange his pillow my watchchainand fob slid loose from my pocket and dangled immediatelyover his head . I saw  --  and I believe it was one of the most exciting experiences of my life  --  that blank gaze brighten and focus to an actual glint of intelligence . He reached out a fumbling little hand and grabbed at the chain . I was so delighted that I cried out : " Molly , Molly , come quick . The baby 's got good sense ! " Molly , running in from the next room , exploded in laughterwhen I confessed the fears that I had harbored now for four long months . Mrs. Fayerlee , too , was delighted with the joke . " Do n't you know that babies never notice till they 're four or five months old ? " she asked . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have good sense that I did not mind being twitted . This first sign of intelligence was soon followed by others . In three days ' time he had learned to guide my watch into his mouth and cried when he was deprived of it . I believe Dick was considered ap129precocious baby . ( Girls , Mrs. Fayerlee informed me , were always smarter than boys . ) Dick , however , in spite of his sex , managed to sit alone two days before he was six months old . At seven and a half he was crawling . The problem then was to furnish him objects to play with . He liked anything shiny and hard . Old talcum-powder boxes , china nest eggs , silver spoons  --  he would put anything into his mouth . It was while I was watching him at these antics that the first and last ideas I ever had about the education of young children came into my head . Aunt Frances was sick and I had been left alone with him while Molly was upstairs taking a nap . They had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and put all his playthings around him . He was not satisfied with this arrangement , however , and kept flinging his toys from him . Sometimes they fell out of his reach and I would have to bend over and retrieve them for him . I had been at this business a half hour or so and was finding it rather wearisome . Dick , in the middle of the quilt , was chewing on his rubber rattle in exactly the same way that a puppy worries an old shoe . But a well-trained puppy , I thought suddenly , will drop an object at the word of command . Dick was now nine months old ; Gy had gone into the field at six months . I did not see why Dick was not old enough to learn a few simple words of command . The rattle dropped from his hand and rolled against the fender . He started crawling towards it at once . I thought that this was a good time to teach him to " down charge " as it were . As his hand went out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have spoken to a dog : " Down , sir . . . . Down ! " He let go of the rattle , straightened up laboriously and stared at me for a moment then reached out for the rattle again . " Down , sir ! " I said in the same severe tone.  | He blinked a few times , then his forehead wrinkled , his mouth widened piteously and he howled at the top of his lungs . The suddenness and the high pitch of his howls took me aback . I was not prepared to face Mrs. Fayerlee when she came rushing into the room . That remarkable woman knew without a word what I had been up to . She snatched the baby up and holding him tight in her arms informed me that her grandson was not a bird dog and not to be treated like one , not in her house , if she knew it . I know when I am licked . I got up and went outdoors . After all a child , a boy , up to the age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women and , I decided , might as well be left there . It was when Gy was in his third season that our little girl was born . She was named Sarah for her maternal grandmotherbut she was a perfect Maury . I have very definite memories of the boy 's infancy but few of hers . One day she was a baby sitting in a carriage and surveying the world out of a pair of dark eyes  --  it was her very dark eyes , like my own , that made her always look so unbabylike  --  the next she was a child of six , all arms and legs romping about the house . Although she was a tomboy she was inclined to be bookish . I see her reading , standing on one foot so as not to seem too engrossed while the call shrills through the house : " Salleee . . . go out and play . " Once as she closed her book she surveyed me gravely and asked : " Daddy , what makes you like to hunt so much ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a better time when I 'm hunting than any other time . " " And I have a better time reading , " Sally replied as she dutifully walked out to play.  |p131But  I am getting ahead of my story . Dick , curly-haired and blue-eyed , had just got to the talking stage and was the idol of the whole household . His nurse was old Aunt Frances , an enormously fat , waddling old woman . She nursed Sally , too , but Dick was her favorite . She used to hold him in her arms muttering : " Dis here one 's de flower of de flock . " Once just as he was learning to talk I said to him : " Boy , who is you ? " He looked up at me with a charming smile and piped : " I 's de flower of de flock . " His mother rushed over and clasped him in her arms . I see them now , the mother and child embracing under the great sugar tree where in the summertime rockers sat in a half circle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to kilts and Molly wore a dimity dress that was sprigged with blue roses . As she got up , the child in her arms , and walked towards the house , I saw that its flounces just brushed the ground . I remember observing with surprise that her figure was noticeably less fragile than it had been a few years ago and yet she seemed more beautiful to me than she had been in early girlhood . I know now looking back that this was a halcyon period in my life but I can not remember how many years comprised it . The seasons at Merry Point had a way of following each other so swiftly that you hardly got your bearings in one beforeanother was upon you . There was only one dull month in my calendar : January . I hardly know how I ever got through it . But from February on I always managed to get in some fishing . Then came August and dove shooting and then the bird season . That lasted well into December and before it was gone duck shooting began . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ those days.  | It was when Gy was in his fifth season and Dick seven years old that a change came into our lives . I am not ambitiousas people ordinarily reckon ambition . I think I would have been contented to stay at Merry Point the rest of my life if fortune had not decreed otherwise . But a friend who had been president of a small seminary in Mississippi fell ill . He had to find somebody to take up his work and he thought of me . His offer , conveyed to me by letter , was so attractive financially that I felt that I could not refuse it . I thought that Molly would hate to leave Merry Point and her family but I found to my surprise that she was even more anxious to go than I was . The truth is she wanted to get the children to herself . Mrs. Fayerlee now in her brisk and capable fifties had taken almost entire charge of them since birth  --  Molly , she said , was hardly more than a baby herself . Aunt Frances was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down . Once I remember I was sitting on the porch when I heard her call to her mistress who was superintending the raking up of some leaves in the yard . " Miss Sally , you better run quick . Miss Molly done picked up de baby . She 'll let him drap shore as de world . " These two , of course , were very much opposed to our goingto Mississippi . I hardly know which was the more outspokenin her disapproval . Mrs. Fayerlee prophesied malaria and its attendant chills and fevers and rehearsed various illnessesthe children had already had , and speculated on how they would have pulled through them without experienced nursing . " If Molly now were of a different temperament . . . " she would murmur . Molly remained stubbornly determined in the midst of 41l this opposition . She had some support , I think , from her father who said that in his opinion any young woman with good sense could bring up two healthy children . Aunt Frances thought that " Miss Molly done studied in them books toop133much to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good deal the day we left and clasped Dick to her ample bosom on parting . Over his curls her rheumy eyes sought her mistress 's . " Ai n't no tellin ' if we 'll ever see dis chile agin , " she muttered . When he undressed that night Molly found that a rabbit'sfoot was slung by a greasy string about his neck . I urged her to let him keep it on for luck , at least until the trip was over , but she made him throw it away . Later she acknowledged that I had perhaps been right for we did meet disaster on the journey ... . To go down the Mississippi on a boat is to tell time goodbye . One day merges imperceptibly into the next . You forgetwhether the journey is to take days or weeks . . . . I walked about on the deck a good deal or hung over the rail to watch the negro roustabouts shooting craps below .. . Ada from Decatur . . . Little Joe from Baltimo ' .. . Snake Eyes . . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Cairo ! " when they took the dice away from him . I had never heard that expression before . I asked the captain what it meant . " You 'll find out , " he said , " when you get to Cairo . " We reached Cairo and found that as happened two out of three times we had to stop over for the night . I left my family on the boat and started uptown to find a hotel . The first one I came to looked dingy . I went on until I came to " The Marshall House , " an old-fashioned residence lately converted into a hotel with , I noted , many outbuildings in the rear . The clerk was taking a nap on the veranda . I went in , looked around and came back to him . " This hotel seems to be all right , " I said , " but any decent hotel has proper accommodationsfor me and my family . What I 'm looking for is accommodations for my dog . What have you got ? " IIe blinked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wash house in tae back yard . We went around to inspect it . A small brick building , in good repair , with one small window high up towards the ceiling . I told the man I thought it would do . We put Gy in it that night . I tied him and locked the door and put the key in my own pocket . We were all tired that night and went to bed early . About ten o'clock the clerk roused me to get the key . Gy had been barking and people had complained . He thought that if he untied him so he could move freely he might quit barking . I went down with him and we untied Gy . He was furious at being confined . I gave him a run around the block , then put him in again , hoping that by this time he would understand it was necessary . He was still upset from the trip and unusually recalcitrant and he was barking again by the time I got upstairs . Molly had undressed and was sitting before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I suppose he 'll bark all night , " she said . " Lord knows , " I answered and fell to walking restlessly about the room . " I do n't suppose the hotel people 'd let me bring him up here , " I said after a little . Molly , finishing her braid , compressed her lips before she spoke . " I do n't suppose they would , Professor Maury . " I pricked up my ears at that . Having begun calling me Professor Maury when I was her teacher she had never formed the habit of calling me by my first name . But usually it was " darling . " A lapse into the old tutorial style of addressmeant trouble ahead . " No , " I said hurriedly . " No , I 'm sure they would n't . " Molly got up from the mirror and bc.gan putting some of  --  the children 's things away . Suddenly to my intense surprise she began to speak , bitterly , reminding me that I had not felt the slightest anxiety when Dick at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gloversville alone . " A difficult trip , pI35too , " she said , " with an hour 's wait at Bowling Green . And you laughed when I was worried . " I thought that this was unfair and said so . Dick had been put in the care of the conductor who was a friend of mine . Besides I was foolish enough to point out , " Dick to anybody but his parents looks like any other little boy of seven . Gy is the smartest bird dog in Kentucky . " My wife began to cry . I had made a fool of myself . I hastened to explain that what I really meant was that people were not so apt to steal children  --  their upbringing in itself was a considerable expense while a bird dog could live week in and week out on ash cake and buttermilk . Gy , after all , was only a bird dog . She herself was the apple of my eye and after her , of course , the children . She knew that perfectlywell . She did know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been to bitterness . She was tired , she said , and the dog 's barking had made her nervous . . . . He had mopped barking . Perhaps I 'd better go down and look in on him one more time . I started to do it and then I decided that I had made enough fuss for one night about a bird dog . I got in bed beside my wife and soon after that went to sleep . I slept soundly and did not wake until the clerk called me at seven ' clock . I got up at once , dressed and went downstairs . The o older children were already dressed and running up and own in the hall . Sally came up and took me by the hand . " Daddy , " she said , " there 's a swing in the back yard and c swung in it , clear up to the roof of that house where is. , , " We told the man to let him out so he could play with us It he would n't do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mood for children 's prattle so early in the morning and answered them shortly . " Quite right , too . Ip136do n't want Gy running all over the place the way you all do . " He was offended and drew back . " Mother said we could play in the yard . " I had no time to soothe him , however , and hurried on downstairs . As I passed the desk the clerk turned from the telephone . " Have you seen my dog this morning ? " I called . He shook his head . " Have n't had time to go out yet . " I nodded and went on out the back way and down the brick walk . The children crowded up behind me as I inserted the key in the lock . Dick was whistling the shrill whistle he had for Gy . I thrust them aside and pushed the door open . " Boy . . . " I called . " Here , boy . . . " and then fell abruptly silent . The little house was empty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going and peering behind the half-open door as if he were convinced that the dog must be inside . I stood on the brick walk staring until Molly called impatiently from an upper window : " Go out and look in that alley . " I roused myself , went out and looked up and down the alley which ran back of the premises . I followed it to its conclusion in a settlement of negro cabins , calling at the top of my voice all the while . But no Gy came . We stayed there another day and night . To satisfy Molly I offered a hundred dollars reward but there was no response . I had not expected any . Anybody who would get Gy would not give him up , I was convinced , for a paltry hundred dollars . When we reached Memphis we had another day 's stop-over.  |p137In  the afternoon I went around to call on an old hunting friend , William Mason . I found him in his office on the sixth floor and sitting beside him looking mournfully out of the window @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid my eyes on . A lordly fellow , big boned , snow white , his only spot of color a patch over the left eye . We sat there all afternoon talking , mostly about Gy . Williamthought that if anything he surpassed the old bitch , his mother . " Not as fast on his feet but with more natural bird sense .... You remember that day at Cousin Jim 's , we counted up and found that he 'd had forty birds killed over him ... " We talked on . The pointer got up once or twice and roamed the room . Its windows looked out on an expanse of brick wall , not even a leaf broke its monotony . I wondered how a man could endure to look out on it day after day . The cleaning woman had put her head in the door the second time . I stood up to go . The pointer padded over to his master 's side . William reached down and pulled his ear . " This poor old fellow ... splendidly bred but he 'll probably never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never been out of the city . " I told him that he ought to be ashamed of himself to keep the dog cooped up like this . He smiled . " Professor , I 'm afraid I have n't as strong a character as yours . I have n't got in three days ' hunting in the last five years . " We walked to the door . William paused , his hand on the knob . " Look here , " he said , " why do n't you take him and train him ? It 'd be a hard job but I believe you could do it . . . . I do n't know any other man that could . . . " I looked down at the pointer . I was tempted for a moment and then I thought of what a long and arduous business it is to train a dog . I shook my head and told William that I did not have the heart for it . The journey from Memphis to Oakland is monotonous : mile after mile of flat fields covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the hangingmoss that festooned all the trees and Molly thought that it was romantic ; but I , who had once lived in a pine-covered country , found it depressing and I was glad to get my first sight of the town  --  a cluster of red-brick , white-verandaed houses set under giant live oaks and surrounded by crape myrtles and other flowering shrubs . A negro drove us in a rattling hack up to the Marston House where we would stay until we could find a house of our own . The hotel was cool after the heat of the train . We bathed and changed our clothes and felt refreshed . The baby , after a dinner of bread and milk , had fallen wearily asleep upstairs . The rest of us sat in the half-darkened diningroomand ate sparingly of fried chicken , rice and gumbo and hot biscuits , washed down with copious draughts of iced tea . At three o'clock Mr. James Lane , the president of the seminary board , came and took me over to the school . I had had correspondence with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : a tall , red-headed man , good-humored enough on the whole yet somewhat impressed with his own importance . As we walked along the village , street he talked of the difficulties they had had in finding the right head for the seminary  --  it had been founded in 1856 by his grandfather and was called originally Lane 's Seminarybut the name after the Civil War had been changed to Oakland Collegiate Institute . Old Professor Baldwin had been head of the school until his death ten years ago . He  --   |p139Lane   --  and Mr. Crosman , vice-president of the board , had been much impressed by my references and he was glad to think that their troubles were over . I would find in Mr. Morrow an able assistant . As Harry Morrow was to play a part in my future life I had better stop now to describe him . I saw him first looking down upon me from one of the ivied windows of the old college building . I saw his face , startlingly blond in the shadows , and struck even in that brief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was at the window . lie replied that it was doubtless Mr. Morrow , the assistant , and broke off his encomium on the young man only as the key turned in the lock and we entered the darkened , desertedhall . The door at the right which bore " Office " in faded characterswas slightly ajar . There were quick steps inside and the young man came to meet us . He was tall and blond and wore pince-nez on a gold chain . The first thing that struck me about him was his look of self-sufficiency . Mr. Lane performed the introductions and the three of us sat talking of the school and of plans for the coming year . Morrow had arrived towards the end of the last term but he seemed already to have a very good grasp of affairs . He showed me a schedule of classes which he said had worked last year ; he even gave me in his calm , matter-of-fact voice tips as to which patrons were likely to be troublesome and would have to be handled carefully . Mr. Lane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abilities , sat by beaming and throwing in a word now and then and after a while went away and left us together . We sat on in the cool , darkened room . I had lit my pipe and leaned back in my chair staring idly out over the lawn . It was pleasant to have got so much troublesome detail attendedto in such order . I felt agreeably relaxed . The school ,  |p140I  thought , would probably run along smoothly , with a minimum of effort on my part , under the assistantship of this capable young man . My thoughts turned , as they always did when I was released from practical cares , to sport . I asked Morrow if there were not a great many quail in the country roundabouts . He said that he believed there were . " Do n't you ever go hunting ? " I askedHe shook his head , smiling . " What do you do with yourself after hours ? " I asked curiously . He smiled again . " I read a good deal , " he said cautiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Some secret , bland quality in his smile made me realize that he had divined my enthusiasm for sport and regarded it as a weakness . I was suddenly beset with curiosity to know what this assured young man did care for . Turning in my chair I regarded him . He was leaning back in the swivel chair that should by rights have been occupied by me , his long legs , encased in pale-gray trousers stretched out before him , his pince-nez chain swinging carelessly back and forth in his hand . Aware of my scrutiny he smiled again and some flash of understanding passed between us so that I was able to address him candidly : " You 're a fine young fellow . What 're you going to do with yourself ? " He looked thoughtfully out on the shaded lawn where two peacocks strutted . " I 'll teach here or in some school like this a couple of years , then I 'll go on to the presidency of some mushroom college . Eventually I 'll land a deanship in some larger institution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested in the administrative end than in teaching . " I stood up , holding up my hand . " Well , " I said , " it 's a fine thing to see a young fellow who knows exactly wherep141he 's going . Usually they do n't have any more idea about it than the man in the moon . " Harry Morrow had stood up , toq , and was smiling thoughtfully . " No , " he said , " they do n't . " Two days later we moved into what was called the " HemmingCottage . " It was no cottage but an ugly be-turreted mansion set far back on a tangled lawn . Miss Violet Hemmingand her brother , Mister Willy , had lived there until fifteen years ago when Miss Violet had been committed to a state institution for the insane . Since then she had escaped several times and had been seen once or twice wandering about on the lawn . I suppose the neighbors did n't like the idea of encountering Miss Violet , for the place had remained untenanted for years until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as we saw it that the house with the addition of a little paint and plaster would suit us exactly . Molly asserted that the rambling lawn would be ideal for the children but I think the real reason we liked the place was because of its ugliness . Both of us had been brought up in just such ugly rambling old houses . Then , too , there was the great tangle of syringa , crape myrtle and cape jessamine bushes between you and the street . It was easy to fancy you were in the country and neither of us at that time had ever lived in even a small town . Mister Willy who boarded a little way down the street with the Misses McFarlane , used to come up often in the afternoons and sit in a remote corner of one of the porches  --  there were seven  --  staring out over the tangle of shrubbery . People asked us if it did n't disturb us to have him coming hack so often but after his first few visits I do n't think any of us ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Violet . She had not lived here in fifteen years but the flavor of her personality still lingered . The door between the dining-room and hall was boarded up . Molly could never bring herself to ask permission to onboardit , so we always went out on the latticed back porch to enter the dining-room . There were evidences of Miss Violet 's eccentricities too in the shrubbery scattered over the lawn . A regular labyrinth of crape myrtle bushes took up one entirecorner and immediately in front of the house were two flower beds which used every spring to arouse my startled interest . Tulips , hyacinths , jonquils , every spring flowering bulb that I have heard of ran in wavering lines out from a common centre ; the effect , even after years of neglect , was still indescribably geometrical , as if a star whirling madly had burst into bloom . In spite of its peculiarities and not a few inconveniences the house became very dear to us . It was , for one thing , the first establishment of our own that we had ever had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her own house and managing her own children . And while I had always liked the freedom from responsibility and all the pleasant bustle of Merry Point , I found that there were advantages in having a house of your own . I had in the Hemming house what I had never had before and have never had since , a study that suited me exactly . I write " study " and smile , realizing that for us the word did not mean what it would have meant to most people . My study was primarily a place to keep fishing tackle . The Hemmingstudy was the largest place of this kind that I have ever had at my disposal . I could lay lines out to dry on the floor without danger of invasion by the children ; the door was always kept locked against them . There were two huge closets , in one of which I kept my guns and ramrods and oilingrags . The other closet was given over to fishing tackle . There was an old broken-down horsehair sofa on which Ip143sometimes took an afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to correct papers . The swivel-chair in which I sat tilted so far that when I leaned back to mediate I looked straight into the branches of the great live-oak outside the window . Sometimes a bald dome-like object was visible on my horizon : Mr. Willy often took his chair out under the live-oak tree . I was never actively conscious of his presence , however , and could not have told you on what particulardays he sat under that tree . I was always more conscious of Miss Violet 's presence in the room . Her picture , one of those crayon enlargements of the eighties , hung over my mantel . Molly had said on the day we moved in that it really was a pretty picture and then had never had it taken down . Miss Violet , crimped and frizzed and attired in a spreading ruffled gown , was sitting in a swing , a bunch of daisies in her lap . There was a sort of picture hat too from under which she looked out sombrely . I was always , while I worked in that room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became associated in my mind with the Antigone , which I was then reading to keep up my Greek . I did not spend much time in the study . The weather was fine that fall and I was determined to get in as much sport as I could . The school , by now , was not taking any more than the usual amount of my time and little of my energy . This was due to the efficiency of my assistant . He was not a particularly good teacher but he made up for it in administrativeability . The schedule he had recommended worked as he had said it would , perfectly . The few conflicts that arose with students taking irregular courses were ironed out as if by magic ; discipline , that bug-bear of teachers , seemed no longer a concern of mine . The machinery of the whole school ran as if on greased wheels . At the same time I found that my own prestige was in no whit diminished by Morrow'sactivities . It was rather the other way . He managed to surround me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made it unnecessary for me to exert myself often . Recalcitrant boys were told regretfully that if they offended one more time they might have to be sent to " ProfessorMaury " but few pupils ever found their way into my office . Harry was capable of dealing with any misdemeanors . He liked dealing with difficulties and , I think , too , that he genuinely liked me . He often showed unusual consideration for what must have seemed to him my weakness . It was he , not I , who had the brilliant idea of cutting out the lunch hour and running straight through it , having school let out at two instead of three by substituting a brief intermission for the usual lunch hour . " Those children all eat a snack at eleven o'clock anyway , " he explained . " It wo n't hurt them to go without their lunch till two o'clock . And you can have the whole afternoon then for your sport . " Molly , for some reason , was particularly annoyed with this arrangement . She did not like Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant , indeed in some ways a brilliantyoung man . " I believe he 'd step over his grandmother 's dead body to get anything he wanted , " she said once . " I take it you mean me , " I returned , " but what 's the differenceas long as the grandmother , being dead , does n't object to being stepped on . " She looked at me enigmatically and did not answer and I was made aware not for the first time that my wife would have been better pleased if I had had more worldly ambition . I was nearing forty years of age and I should have been thinking about getting on in the world if I were ever to think of it . I must confess that the thought was farther than ever from my mind in those days. p 145The country around Oakland was better than I had expectedit would be . Ideal cover for birds in those acres and acres of gently rolling cotton fields . Colonel Potter , the largestcotton grower thereabouts had given me the privilege of shooting over his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cotton but a good deal of low swampy land too  --  and I was exploring the tract with much the same enthusiasm that I had expended on the Merry Point country when I first arrivedthere . Colonel Potter had been good enough to lend me a dog too ; a setter , Joe , staunch and perfectly reliable but a dull fellow compared to Gy . I had thought in the first grief over losing Gy that I would never bring myself to train another dog . A few afternoons with Joe made me wish that I or some fairly competent person had had the training of him . He had an annoying habit of breaking his point and nothing could make him hunt Dead for more than two seconds at a time . I began to wish that I had , after all , yielded to William Mason 's proposal and brought the white pointer down with me . It would have been a hard business to train a dog two years old who had never been in the field , but I might have something when I got through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then one day when we had lived in Oakland about two weeks came a telegram from William . He would be down on the early morning train Saturday and he would bring his dog with him ! He arrived at twelve o'clock . We ate a hurriedlunch and set out . I had looked the country over andas bursting with information . A flat cotton country yetith plenty of cover . A bird paradise . You could get upen or eight coveys in an afternoon . We walked through the little town talking excitedly , the white pointer gambolling about us like a puppy . . . . Wee to the edge of one of Colonel Potter 's fields . The dog opped , raised his head , then was off like a flash.  | I stood there , amazed at the magnificence of his stride . " Look at him ! Look at him ! " William was crying . . . . He had taken a six-strand barbed-wire fence as smoothly as a swallow takes a barn . My life  --  my sporting life  --  would have been very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little boy from the village came running up to tell me that Sally had fallen off the porch and cut her head badly . We hurried back to the house and found Molly , very much agitated , bandaging the baby 's head . The wound was not deep and healed quickly of first intention but we spent an anxious evening watching the baby who cried a good deal and complainedof pain in her head . And , of course , William 's afternoonwas ruined . He left the next morning on an early train . Trecho stayed with me . I was not proof against the pointer 's magnificence . The next day was Monday . I could hardly wait until school was over to take him out . We went again to Colonel Potter 's field . And as on the day before Trecho set out and quartered the ground magnificently . I had only a few minutes to exult in him , however . There was a flock of sheep browsing on that grass . When they saw this white monster careering towards them they stampeded . Trecho was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The fool never even looked back . I raised my gun and let him have the right-hand barrel . He did n't even yelp . I let him have the left-hand barrel . He yelped fiercely then , turned and started for town . He rushed home and into the cottage and , all bloody as he was , jumped up into the middle of Molly 's bed . She ran him out with a broom . He went under the house then and it was there I found him when I got back to town . He stayed underthere a day and a half . Nothing would coax him out.  |p147Finally  I bribed a negro boy to crawl under with a piece of bread , snap the ring on his chain and drag him out . I was very down-hearted . He 'd be as gun-shy from now on as a dog could possibly be . . . . But I could n't send him back to Mason . . . . All day long in the schoolroom while I listened to schoolboys mangling passages from the . AEneid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tried him in the field for several days with a thirty-foot rope tied around the body of a little negro . He 'd jerk that negro down and hunt magnificently within the limits of his tether . But the minute I fired the gun he would howl dismally , lie down and turn over on his back , the picture of terror . This went on until the season was almost over . He was getting no better , worse if anything . But I was as obstinate as he was . I said : " I 'll break you of being gun-shy or kill you . " Finally I hit on a scheme . I chained him to his kennel and gave him no food or water for three full days . He suffered horribly from hunger , of course  --  a pointer is the greediest dog in the world  --  but he suffered even more from thirst . On the evening of the third day I set a pan of water before him . I let him get his mouthi in it and get a few laps . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his back , howling . But he soon got up and went to the water . I fired the gun again . This time he simply crouched and went on lapping . The next time I fired the gun he merely flinched and went on lapping . I brought out a pan of buttermilk and ash cake . He ate it greedily and when I fired the gun this time he did n't even flinch . I tried this over and over . At the end of three days I could fire the gun anywhere on the place and he would come tearing to me . He was a hard-headed dog and his training was one long Struggle . The next thing was to get him to hunt dead . I knew beforehand that I 'd have a hard time with him on that ,  | for it is often impossible to get a seasoned dog to hunt dead as long as you want him to . Trecho was worse about it than any dog I 've ever known . He 'd hunt for a little while but his natural exuberance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What I considered my brilliant success in breaking him of being gun-shy had heartened me considerably . I determined to make him as good a dog as Gy had been . I started out with a rigid program . I 'd kill a bird and throw it surreptitiously on the ground . Trecho would promptlyretrieve it . I 'd take hold of the body then and let him devourthe head . And I never said " Dead " unless I had a bird in the bag . . . . He became the most persistent " Dead " dog I ever knew . I was loath for a long time to grant him the place in my affections that Gy had had , and indeed he never quite took that place . The two dogs were so different . Gy insinuated himself into your affections where Trecho bowled you over . I came , however , to value him as highly as ever I had valued Gy . He had some qualities that were out of Gy 's range : a certain boldness . It showed itself in independent mental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me away from home during the whole of one season . It was hard on me and I regretted it even more on Trecho 's account . He was getting rheumatic . I knew he would n't be able to hunt many more seasons . I had told John Harvey to hunt him as often as he could . Trecho turned up at John 's the second day of the season . John hunted him three days , then got busy about his farming and did no more hunting f or a week . Trecho had disappeared . He thought , of course , that he had gone home . At the end of the season 's second week he met Jack Trimble on the road . Jack told him he hoped I would n't get home till the bird season was over , he was having such sport with the old dog . Jack hunted allp149that week then he too got busy and had to miss several days . Trecho lay around the Trimble house a while that morning then he got up and went over to John Harvey 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the season was over when he quietly went back home . When I got back they comparednotes ; we found that he had n't missed a day . I used to love fox hunting but looking back on it I see that it was for me at any rate a boy 's callow love , founded on excitement and the sense of rivalry . The hullaballoo , the shouting , the looking back to see if So and So is following you over that fence  --  that is all very well when the blood runs freely through the veins and excitement is the breath of the nostrils . But as I have grown older I have learned to take my pleasure more subtly . I like better now to hunt alone . At this period of my life I found much pleasure in contemplatingthe habits of the quail , in building up in my mind his life-cycle . For you must know your bird if you are to take full pleasure in shooting him . The quail is the most pugnacious of all living creatures . He does not , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight between two quails is always to the death . It does not last long . The aggressor thrusts his savage , overhanging beak into the opponent'sjugular vein and pulls it out . The boss cock of a covey does not have to fight often . His authority is recognized . A bachelor , however , as we found when we turned the 300 quail loose in the old barn in Grassdale , lives a life of continual strife . His rage is directed against the mating couples . A lone cock , unmated , will break up every nest if he can whip the mated cock . I have lain quiet in deep sedge grass and have seen the battle and have seen the victor drive the widowed hen off and then deliberatelycrush and trample the eggs . Such contests do not occur , however , unless the boss cock has been killed or the covey otherwise disorganized . A boss150 Aleck Maury , Sportsmancock keeps his covey in order by directing every movement throughout the day . He does this partly by his own activities , partly through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eighteen birds the boss cock will take twelve while the secondcock or lieutenant takes six . They feed along together and when they rise they rise in two bunches . A seasoned hunter learns to pick out the central bird of the larger covey and thereby makes many doubles in a day 's shooting . Quails roost in a ring , their heads out and their tails together , ready to spring up at the least alarm . A field will be covered with rings of their droppings . The tyro will hunt that field all day long and never flush a covey . It is the last place in that vicinity to hunt . The quail had spent the night there but when morning came the boss cock gave his call and they flew a quarter of a mile away to the feeding ground . The feeding ground invariably has cover near by . Usually it is a ravine near a patch of woods . They fly to the far end of the feeding ground and feed during the day toward the cover , never away from it . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves . Night comes . The boss cock gives his call . They spring straight up in the air , fly from a quarter to half a mile and hover gently down . Where they hit the ground they roost . It is these habits which preservethe quail . If they fed until roosting time the fox would scent them and find every covey . The cotton fields around Oakland afforded ideal cover for birds and there was always good hunting in the fall . Some pretty keen sportsmen used to come up even from the Delta to shoot quail there . One of these sportsmen was Mr. Raleigh , a ruddy faced , burly fellow of around fifty . As befittedthe largest cotton grower of his section he had , he would have told you , the two finest dogs that money could buy . Gladstone pointers , Sam and Mary . I was inclined at first to be a little contemptuous of theseP151dogs . I had been told that they stayed with the trainer the whole year around except for the six weeks of the bird season . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dog is apt to suspect the professional trainer . I was sure that these dogs would be over-trained and consequently nervous and hard to handle . But I have rarely seen better trained dogs . It was a pleasure to see them work . And Mr. Raleigh , to my surprise , knew how to handle them . They were perfectly , responsive to him . " Move up , Sam , " he 'd say , and Mary would never break her point . Towards three o'clock I asked him if he wanted to go on shooting singles . " Of course , " he said shortly , " I want to see my dogs work . " " All right , " I replied as shortly . " Of course that 'll cut down the bag . " he looked at me in surprise . " What do you mean , ProfessorMaury ? " I was a little irritated myself by this time . " The quail , " I said , in the tone of a teacher who is repeating an algebraic formula for the twentieth time , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forty to sixty minutes . You 've got good dogs but no dog on earth can scent them under those cir-cumstances . " Mr. Raleigh was evidently not in the habit of being instructed . " Nonsense , " he said . " I 've been shooting birds for thirty years and I never heard of such a thing . " My ill humor vanished . I had enough of the school teacherin me in those days to enjoy confounding a know-it-all . " Let 's go , " I said . We went on shooting singles . About three o'clock the negroesattending us crossed a drain and scared up a large covey . Some of the birds flew straight toward us . I was by then completely possessed by a spirit of mischief . I fired my gun to frighten them . Three birds lit not , , birty steps away from us . I saw them run into a tussock sage . I called to Raleigh . " Get off your horse and come here . " He came . We walked up to the tussock . There they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said , " call your Gladstone dogs . " He called Sam and Mary , and lie and I stood there watchingthe quail while the dogs hunted dead . They hunted within a foot of that particular tussock time and again . We could see the quail motionless , only the glancing of the bright eyes showing that they were alive and could watch the dogs hunting dead within a foot of them and failing to wind them . Raleigh laughed finally . " You win , " he said . " Come on , " I said , " let 's leave these and go on after the others . " He followed me without a word and mounted his horse . We hunted for forty-five minutes against the wind . Suddenlywhen we were within a hundred yards of the marked tussockSam 's head went up . He stiffened to a point . I nodded to Raleigh . We rode up and flushed the quail and shot them . We lived in the Hemming house seven years . Dick by this time was fifteen years old and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two years younger , was still in grammar school . Of the two Sally was the better scholar . Dick ( from the time when at the age of four he had pushed the primer  --  off his mother 's knee announcing " Ditt too ittle to wead " ) had always shown a profound unconcern for his studies . He was particularly weak on languages and had failed that year in his Latin examination . Molly worried over it but I 'm afraid that I could n't get up much concern over the matter ; P153it always amused me to see that here was a Maury who could n't learn Latin . I try to evoke Dick 's memory and he comes back to me most clearly as he looked that summer , just turned fifteen , slimly built , but strong , with fair hair burned almost white by the sun and eyes that were clear as water in his ruddy face . He was Molly 's favorite of the two children . I do not know that he was mine and yet I believe I loved him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the things that endeared him to me was the fact that he was so different from what I myself had been at his age . He was already a splendid swimmer and wrestler but he had no aptitude for the sports to which I had given the best part of my life . I had taken him fishing with me and had soon counted that out . It was apparent that Dick would never make an angler . He had not , either , the natural sense of direction which makes a snap-shot but I was still laboring to make him a straightaway shot . Only a few days before that day of which I now write we had been out in the field together . I had become irritated when he missed several straightaway shots and had put a ban on him . He was to cover his bird , two , three times before he shot . Then when he missed still another shot I made him stand under a tree and watch how it should be done . I laid the Greener down , cocked , stepped off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Now , " I said , " flush the bird . " He flushed it and I turned and picked up the gun with ostentatiousslowness . It was a long shot but I was lucky and killed my bird . I looked over at Dick with the triumph one always feels in a lucky shot . " Do n't you see ? You 've got all the time in the world . A bird on the wing is three times as easy to hit as a bird on the ground . " He nodded and then a humorous glint came in his eye .   " It looks easy when you do it , Dad , but I do n't believe I ever can . I ca n't even hit the middler in marbles . " ... And going home he had said again that he did n't believe he would ever make a good shot and that it was foolish for him to try . It was in July , that Sunday afternoon whose every event remains etched in my brain , a cinematic film that every now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on minute incident by incident to the end . We were sitting under the live-oak tree , Molly and I and our neighbor , Mrs. Hawkins . Dick had gone swimming with the Hawkins boys and Sally and Amy Hawkins were walking to and fro in the lower yard . The younger Hawkins children were playing lady-go-to-see under the rose bushes there . Disputeshad arisen once or twice as to whose child little Billy Hawkins was  --  he was still in the curls and dimples stage whereas Eddie was scrawny and not so satisfactory as a baby . Molly and Mrs. Hawkins had got up and gone over once or twice to lay down the law but they had come back now and were sitting beside the syringa bush sewing . I had sat with them a while , taking part in their conversation but conversation had lapsed and I had moved my chair off a little distance and had been engaged for about an hour in correcting some papers . The shadows were lengthening . I found it harder and harder to concentrate on my work and it occurred to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Molly would summon bearers for the procession of the Sunday night supper when I heard the gate at the far end of the lawn click sharply . rI remember thinking that it was Mr. Hawkins come to join us for the tag-end of the afternoon when Frank Hawkinscame in sight beside the lilac bushes and stumble toward us over the lawn . He was hatless and the ' ' sweat trickling down from his forehead had made little channelsP155through the dust caked on his cheeks . His mouth worked dryly but I heard no words . Mrs. Hawkins set up all at once a shrill screaming . Molly had risen composedly and was putting down her sewing . She said : " Dick ? " " They 're bringing him now , " the boy shouted hoarsely . We had not heard the men come up on the lawn . There were four , each carrying one end of the ragged camp cot . Some garments , boys ' shirts or overall  --  were laid across Dick 's body and up over his face so that we saw only the damp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mrs. Hawkins was still screaming . I remember that Molly put up a hand as if to ward off the sound . " The house , " she said , " take him to the house . " I tried to take hold of her but she broke from me and ran on before them . She was in her bedroom turning down the covers when they brought the stretcher in . We slid Dick off it on to the bed . His face was white . The mouth looked pinched and there were dark circles about his tightly closed eyes . Out on the lawn the Hawkins boy was sobbing hoarsely : " It was that new hole and none of us had ever been there before . . . . " Molly got up from where she had been kneeling beside the bed , her face close to Dick 's still face . She looked from one to the other of the men . " There 's artificial respiration , " she said . " Sometimes you get people to breathe with artificial respiration . " The men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young , rough-looking fellow , went at once to the head of the bed . I Tc took one of Dick 's arms . His companion took the other . They turned him over on his hack and began moving the arms back and forth rhythmically . I stood behind the young fellow and watched the wet patch between his shoulder bladesP156slowly widen and spread until the whole shirt was dark . Suddenlywith a gasp he rose and motioned to me . I bent over and took his place . Frank Hawkins was standing in the doorway . He said that Doctor Gore was out in the country on a case but they expected him back at any minute . I nodded to him and went on working Dick 's arms up and down , up and down .... After a while I realized that the other man was gone and that Molly had taken his place . I do not know how long it was before there was a stir in the hall and Doctor Gore was standing in the doorway . He came in , and stooping over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He held it a moment before he laid it down . I looked at Molly . She was leaning forward , her arm still moving , her eyes fixed on the doctor 's face . He put up his hand and gently stayed her moving arm . " It 's no use , " he said . She cried out then and flung herself downwards on the bed . Mrs. Hawkins came in and all was confusion for a few minutes . She had summoned the doctor again . He wanted to give Molly something to make her sleep but she refused . In a few minutes she got up and went back into the kitchen to give the old cook some belated instructions about supper . At seven o'clock we sat down to the table . Molly told Sally to go to bed as soon as supper was over . She went obediently but a little while later I heard her sobbingin her room . I went in and sat beside her bed . After a little she raised up , her face streaked with tears and said that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sung to the children a great deal when they were little : " Lord Lovell , He Stood at the Castle Gate , " " Bangum 's Gone to the Wild Boar 's Den , " " Barbara Allen . " . . . Sally had always liked " Der Erlkonig "  --  she had had a lurid taste in nurseryP157songs even as a small child . I sat by her bed and sang it through , even to : " In seinen armen das kind lag tot . . . . " When I thought she was asleep I got up and stole out into the hall . In our room Molly was lying face downwards on the bed , one arm flung across Dick 's body . I knelt down beside her and put my arms around her but she did not seem to know that I was there . It was quite dark now but the lamp in the hall outside threw a shaft of light across the lower part of the bed . Dick 's face was a white blur among the pillows but in the space @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see his thin , brown hand , the fingers curled a little back . I put my hand out and covered his cold fingers with mine until Molly stirred and seemed about to turn her head and I took my hand away . Mr. and Mrs. Hawkins had come back and were sitting on the porch . We could hear through the open door the low murmur of their conversation . Every now and then Mrs. Hawkins would come and stand in the doorway a few seconds , then go back to her place on the porch . After a while Molly went out and told them they might as well go home . Mrs. Hawkins protested and said she would stay all night , that " somebody must sit up . " Molly shook her head . " No , " she said , " you 'd better go home now . " Her voice was calm and restrained , even gentle , but looking at her white strained face I grew frightened . I stepped down on to the walk with Mr. Hawkins who had already started home and seized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mrs. Hawkins . I told her I thought it was better , after all , for them to go . I believe I even used the phrase , " better to humor " in regard to Molly.  | She nodded comprehendingly . The good lady as soon as she had anything definite before her was quite equal to it . In a few minutes she was bustling after Mr. Hawkins who was already doggedly making his way through the side gate . Tomorrow , I knew , she would spread it all over town that I feared for Molly 's reason but tonight I did not care . I was only glad to be rid of her kindly , constraining presence . I accompanied them as far as the side gate and turned back through the shrubbery . The house was still dark except for the one light in the hall . It shone through the windows of our bedroom and threw a subdued gleam on the crape myrtle bushes that crowded against that wall of the house . I stood there under the great pine tree and watched the light fall on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dick who lay so still on the bed in there . I stood there and thought how short his life had been and it seemed to me that I had held him back from many pleasures he might have had , feeling that everything was yet in store for him . ... And now he would never do any of these things . When I went back in the house Molly still crouched beside the bed in the half-dark bedroom . I took her hand and told her that she must come now and get some rest . She did not look at me or speak and after a little I realized that she would not move . I got some blankets , for the nights grew cool toward morning now , and we stayed there together besidethe bed until it was day . In the weeks that followed Molly moved about the house composedly , seeming more occupied than usual with her household affairs . It was as if all her energy went to maskingher loss from us . She who was always preoccupied was gentler now with Sally , planned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her that she had never shared be/fore . There were evidences of unusual consideration for me ; my favorite desserts appeared oftener ; Sally was adjured to run and fetch my slippers the minute I came in from hunting ; my big armchair was always in its place in the corner of the porch now instead of being dragged out into the yard . I accepted it all simply at first . Sometimes when I went out in the back yard where the rabbit hutches were now empty or when I woke suddenly in the night and lay thinkingof Dick for an hour before I could go back to sleep , I wondered at her restraint . Then I reminded myself of the difference in our natures . I knew that Molly had always been sustained in the conduct of her daily life by a high sense of duty and I supposed that it was this that sustained her now . Time went on . I began to grow uneasy . Under all the smoothness of the household routine there was a quality , a hush that had never been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be aware of an odd formality in the words ; it was as if we were all on a stage , under the eyes of a sombre , a hostile audience . One day she turned to me and asked for the details of Dick 's death . I recited baldly Frank Hawkins ' story : they had not gone to the usual swimming place in the creek , but to a deeper hole on the river . Dick and the older Hawkins boy had undertaken to swim across , something none of them had ever done before . The boys standing on the bank had seen that the current in the middle was very swift and had called to them to come back . Joe Hawkins had turned back but Dick had gone on . They had seen him go down , come up again , and go down for the third time . . . . It was Frank Hawkins who had remembered finally that there was a boat moored at a landing a few hundred yards down and it was Frank and Joe who had gone out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  |p160Molly  listened intently and asked one or two questions . When I had finished she sat quietly for a few minutes , then said she must go in the house and see about the ice cream . The Proctor children and Sally were playing hide-and-seek on the lawn and Molly had promised them ice cream and cake in the afternoon . A few minutes later she came around the corner of the house followed by Aunt Lallie bearing the freezer . The children came up and began clamoring for their share . Molly was bending over the freezer helping the ice cream into saucers , the children swarming around her , when suddenly she straightened up and stood staring over their heads . The tears were coursing down her cheeks and she began walking rapidly toward the house . I ran down and drew her into our bedroom . She wept frantically , beating her clenched fists against my shoulder , or stumbled blindly about the room moaning . Sally came in from play after a while frightened and was given her supper by Aunt Lallie and put to bed while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bedroom with Molly who had finally fallen into an exhausted sleep . She woke about ten o'clock ; and the paroxysms of grief came on again . I thought of calling a doctor to give her an opiate but decided that she would not take it . The night wore through somehow . Toward dawn she fell into a deep sleep and I was free to sleep too . In the morning she was so white faced and weary looking that I feared she was going to be ill . She seemed calmer , however , roused herself and went apathetically about her duties . In the afternoon she fell again into a fit of sobbing which lasted far into the night . It was like that many times afterwards . Sometimes I would be roused in the night by her wild sobbing or would wake to find the bed empty and know that she was up and wandering about the house and grounds . The feverish care of her house and family had long ago diminished . She leftp161things more and more to Aunt Lallie and sat sometimes all day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her , her hands folded in her lap . I had long ago given up all exercise in the field and used to come straight home from school in the afternoon , for sometimes coming out of one of those wild fits of sobbing she would turn to me utterly spent and I would have to sit beside her and tend her as if she were a child . But graduallyher attitude changed . It was as if my apparent recoveryfrom the bereavement  --  and to her distraught mind I must have appeared perfectly recovered  --  had put a barrier between us . She rarely spoke to me now of Dick . I grew to feel that she did not want me with her and I sat those fall afternoons in my study in the other wing of the house . Reading was impossible . I sat in the ( lusty faded room or paced about , always with the feeling of waiting for something , I did n't know what . There is a kind of inaction that produces an unendurable weariness . It seemed to me that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I could endure it no longer . I took my gun down , called Trecho from his place under the live-oak tree and went quietly out of the side door . There was no one in sight in the yard . I made my way through the shrubbery , slipped through the hedge and was in the field . There was no cover here under the pine trees but at the lower end the ground was swampy and broken . Trecho had already made for this broken ground . I could see his white shoulders now stiff against the sky that was alreadytinged with sunset color . I went up and sent him in . The birds rose thunderingly . Their wings were black against the gray turrets of the house in the moment that I raised my gun , picked out the middle bird and dropped him.  | THAT night I sat down and wrote letters to friends in Gloversville . In a few days the answers came . John Ferguson , who wanted me to come back to that part of the country , thought my idea of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Doctor Massey , was not so sure that the venture would be successful . Ile thought , however , that it would be worth trying , especially if as I said I could not stay any longer in Mississippi . More letters passed back and forth . A few weeks later it was all settled . In August we packed our household goods and set off for Tennessee . Molly and Sally were to spend the remainder of the summer at Merry Point while I stayed in Gloversville , eleven miles away , to make the necessary arrangements for opening the school . I took a room in the Franklin House which is situated on what is now called the old square . The old hotel is perched just above the river . From my room I could look down on the wharf , could see just around the bend the clump of willowsthat marked the place where the ill-fated City of Gloversvillewent down  --  the citizens like to remember that but for a sudden change of plans the Swedish Nightingale would have gone down on that ill-fated boat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ register which still lay on the marble-topped table in the front hall . And Lafayette , making a pious pilgrimage to lay a wreath on the grave of his comrade in arms , Beverly Stubblefield , had passed down that same river . There was a bench under a sycamore on the very edge of the bluff . I used to sit there in the morning and talk with John Ferguson who often came riding into town those days . In the afternoons I would walk uptown to the " new square " and loiter about talking with whoever came by or drop in at the gunshop where Sid More was always to be found at work on his bench . I seemed even to myself to be unusually idle and yet I was making headway with my school . One of the things I did in preparation seems as I look back a little fantastic and yet it was in the spirit of the times and of the place . I had gone over to the college to see Doctor Massey the first morningafter my arrival . The doctor , spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had been when I knew him as a boy in Virginia , received me in his study and told me in few words what I must do . " If you want to have a successful school in Gloversville you must win the approbation of Doctor Wright . " It happened that I had never met Doctor Wright but I was familiar with his legend . A fellow of Oxford who had arrived in America just before the Civil War , he had been for years the intellectual arbiter of the town . The old gentleman was the typical absent-minded scholar . He lived at the hotel on the old square . Mr. Billy Bringhurst , the genial proprietor of the hotel , looked after him , reminding him to change his carpet slippers for boots before going out upon the street or to put on an overcoat in cold weather . Sometimes he had to tell the doctor whether or not he had eaten his meals that clay . It was his custom to rise early and come down for what was called the " drummer 's breakfast " at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in some perplexity . " Billy , " he said , " have I had any breakfast this morning ? " " Certainly , Doctor , " Billy replied , " you had breakfast with the drummers as usual . "  |p167When  the doctor still remained uncertain , Billy specified what he had had for breakfast . Red ham and gravy with boiled eggs . The doctor , very much relieved , went back to his room . He remembered the eggs perfectly , he said ; they had been overdone . One morning in July John Ferguson and I were ushered into his sitting-room there at the hotel . We were kept wait- " ing a few minutes before the doctor appeared , still wearing his matutinal skull cap and carpet slippers . I felt foolish as I rose to greet him but I had been coached in what I should do , and I set about doing it . As he came through the doorway I advanced into the middle of the room and began reciting the first twenty lines of his translation of " Iphigenia . " " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point where his translation broke off , " why did you stop there ? " The doctor emitted a deep " Hah ! " " I have lapsed , " he said sadly . " Indulge senibus . But what are you doing here , my boy ? " My good friend John then told him that I intended to open a school in Gloversville . IIe was interested and generouswith offers of help . " There is one man in this town whose son you must have . Get Henry Sarratt and the rest will follow like sheep . " Ile shook his head , pondering . " He is a blue-nosed Presbyterian , " he said , " and like all that ilk devilishly obstinate . But I will give him a blue mass pill and you must go to see him . Go to see him the very day after-wards . " The doctor and I became fast friends . He loved me , he said frankly , for the Greek . In those days a mutual admirationof the classics cemented many a friendship . The men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together as do exiles in a strange land . And indeed it was as if they belonged to or at least had access to another coun- try than their own , so potent is love of the Humanities . It has seemed to me sometimes that the neglect of the classics has perhaps contributed to the savagery of our times . My own alma mater , the University of Virginia , was one of the last to debase its curriculum . . . . But I do not concern myself with these matters now , having long ago decided to let the world go its own gait . To return to my own fortunes . The doctor prescribed the blue mass pill . Mr. Sarratt took it . I called upon him on the day specified and he not only agreed to send his two sons to my school but to exert his influence to get me as many other pupils as possible . By the end of the next week I had fifty pupils promised . In the meantime I had found on Madison street an old red brick house that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schoolhouse . I was so elated , having found both schoolhouse and pupils  --  and that in a much shorter time than I had expected  --  that I decided to ask Molly to come in from Merry Point now instead of waiting until the end of the summer as we had agreed . The old brick house which I had rented proved adaptable for my purposes . Our living quarters were on the second floor and on the ground floor in the rooms on the western side of the house . The two rooms on the east side were thrown together ; they made , when the carpenters had finished with them , a very creditable long school room . There was also the furniture . I was lucky enough to get hold of some secondhand desks and benches which had been stored in one of the tobacco warehouses since the old male academy had broken up , and only the next week I set about having them installed . A painter was set to work , too , painting white the window glass as high as a man 's waist  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lessons as long as there is anything going on in the street outside . The boys ' desks faced east and west . My own desk and swivel chair were placed in the centre of the long east wall so that I commanded a full view of the desks . An oaken bucket with a dipper sat on a little three-legged stool beside my desk : the boys were not so apt to linger over getting a drink when it was taken in view of the schoolmaster . Behind the desk was a row of shelves containing all the books from my library that I considered fit for the boys ' perusal . I smile now , realizing that a boys ' school nowadays would require many more furnishings  --  gymnasiums , swimming pools , laboratories ; there seems no end to the trappings requiredby the young . But at the time of which I write , people  --  inthe South at least  --  still held to the idea of the oldfashionedclassical school . It actually had not occurred to me that boys needed to know anything more than Latin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not enumerated my most important educational appliance . It reposed in my hip pocket . I could draw it , the boys said , like a revolver . Indeed I had chosen it because the sharp rap-rap was like an explosion . Very early in my teaching career I had solved the problem of discipline . When I heard a disturbance in the schoolroom I drew my strap as explosively as possible , waded in and licked the largest boy involved in the disturbance . The method was doubtless crude but in the end I believe we achieved a rough justice . The big boys knew that if they got into a scuffle with a smaller boy they were the ones likely to get the licking . . . . I do not remember ever having a case of bullying to deal with . I have said that my school adhered to the old-fashioned classical tradition . But association with Harry Morrow had had some effect on me after all . For it was there in Gloversvilleat the Maury Academy , as the school was known , that I introduced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ English . The Rhetoric class we called it . It included all the larger boys in school  --  the pleasures of Rhetoric were deniedto the young fry . At a quarter of one the big boys came forward and took their places on the front row . It was the last hour of the day . I remember I always took a good chew of tobacco before we started . The older boys did likewise . ( It was tacitly understood that no boy under sixteen was allowed to chew tobacco in my presence though I never made any open ruling to that effect . ) We all sat there relaxed and content while I or one of the boys who had a tolerable enunciation read aloud , The Lady of the Lake , The Leatherstocking Series , or once in a while  --  the boys did not take kindly to Tennyson  --  The Idylls of the King . One scene comes back to me from that Rhetoric class as if it were yesterday . They are all ranged in their seats , Stackers , Graceys , McGehees , Carneys , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one alien face among them . At the beginning of that season Bud Hancock , one of my fishing pardners down on Spring Creek , had come saying that he wanted his boy to go to school to me that year . Tom was a strapping young fellow , keen as a briar . I often went hunting with him in the fall ; he had two of the finest coon dogs in the country , Troop and Drum , and at sixteen he could handle them like a veteran . I had been a little perplexed , though , when honest Bud told me he wanted Tom to enter my school ; I did n't know exactly how the boys would receive him . I need n't have worried . Tom could hold his own anywhere . In a few months his square sturdy figure was moving about on the athletic field with exactly the same assured motion that he had in the woods . On this day of which I write we were reading from The Lady of the Lake . I had taken the hook away from Norfleet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flowp171of those periods . It was the close of the Stag-at-Eve passage . Fitz-James is alone in the mountains . The quarry has taken to the lake and the hounds have gone in after him . " Two hounds of black St. Hubert 's breed , " Unmatched for courage , strength and speed . .. . " I read on to the edge of the passage and looked up . The town boys ' faces were decorous and impassive as usual but Tom Hancock 's face was shining . As he caught my eye he half rose from his seat : " Lord God , ' Fessor , whar could I git some of their get ? " There is always a particular moment , I suppose , when events take a definite turn for good or ill ; it is hard to recognize it when it comes but later you can look back and say that it was at this moment or that . It came to me two days after we had moved into the Madison street house . I had been out all afternoon calling on prospective @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not told Molly , but our capital we had brought with us from Mississippi was already exhausted and I had had to arrange a loan . Having no real estate I had given a lien on my household goods and on my two guns for security , and I was feeling a little depressedas I turned from Seventh street into Madison that afternoon . There was nobody in the house when I went in and that nameless anxiety that always beset me if I did not know where Molly was came over me . I stood in the empty hall calling first " Mother , " then " Sally . " There was silence for a few minutes . The old cook put her head out of the kitchen . " They 's down at the stable . " I went out on the latticed gallery that ran the length of the ell . Molly and Sally were standing in the stable yard below in conversation with a heavy-set elderly gentleman whom I recognized as Jim Ferguson , Mrs. Fayerlee 's brother . He left Molly 's side just then and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen me and came running to the foot of the gallery steps . " Daddy . . . Daddy . . . come down and see Uncle Jim 's colt .... " I went on down the steps and out into the yard . Uncle Jim had reappeared leading a slenderly built black colt with a white star on his forehead . He had given Molly a leg up and she was just then riding off over the stable yard . Uncle Jim seated upon a feed bin greeted me with the jerk of a bushy eyebrow . " Nice place you got here , " he said . " Room for three horses . " Uncle Jim had inherited along with a famous brood mare the horsey propensities of his grandfather who in his day had been a breeder of note . I realized now as I saw him going over the stable and the adjoining yard that he could have told you the exact number of cubic inches that a town horse required for living quarters . Molly had turned around and was riding toward us . I watched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why , " I said , " he singlefoots naturally , does n't he ? " Uncle Jim nodded . " Lady 's riding horse . You could set a cup of water on his hip and he 'd carry it ten miles . " This was one of his favorite expressions but used , I recalled , only to express extreme approbation . I examined the colt more attentively . By " June Bug " ? I asked narking the white star on the forehead and the three white stockings . " His last get , " Uncle Jim said gruffly . I had not even heard that the stallion was dead . I remembered how the old man had prized him and I voiced my sym/pathy now as delicately as I could , recalling some of his exploitson the track before he was put to stud . Uncle Jim listened nodding . " Great horse , " he said . " Great horse . Best I ever bred anyhow . " Molly had come back to us . Uncle Jim got up and laid his hand affectionately on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " is Bessie 's colt . She was out of Fraxinella . Full sister to Flying Blacksmith out of Starlight . She died before you came out to this country . " I stood tranced by the familiar flow of names . Then I realized with a start that Molly still perched on the horse 's back was leaning over and looking not at Uncle Jim but me . There was an eagerness in her face I had not seen for a very long time . I plunged my hand in my pocket . There was ten dollars in cash . . . and another week to run before school opened . " Well , what 'll you take , Uncle Jim ? " I asked . " I want to buy him for Molly . " Molly 's lips parted . " Darling  --  do you suppose we " Uncle Jim was eyeing the horse . " A lady 's riding horse , that 's what he is . Damned if I do n't believe I 'll give him to her . " The year 19 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was twelve years old by this time and limped dreadfully from rheumatism . Molly made him a sheepskin coat that buckled cunningly beneath the belly but even that could not keep the rigors off him . The time came when I could n't stand it any longer . I took him out the first day of the season  --  tell me he did n't know as well as I did when the season opened ! We went into the north field there at Merry Point , through thick sage grass . . . slowly . I stood there and watched him start off . He could not quarter the field in his old magnificent way but his nose was still good . He had winded his birds and was on a point when I shot him . .. . A clean straightaway shot through the head . He fell on his side in deep grass . When I got to him the left foot was still turned back . Sally cried all night but afterwards I liked to remember that he was on a point when he went down ... . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dim . For some time I had suffered from twitching of the lids and black spots danced continuously before my eyes . I put these annoyancesdown to approaching old age and put up with them as uncomplainingly as possible until the day out in one of Garrett Hatcher 's field when I missed a straightaway shot because the birds ' wings had suddenly blurred before my eyes . I put my gun up , rode home and informed my family that I would never hunt again . I could not even see well enough now to hit a mark . Molly took the news calmly , merely remarking that a man of my years ought to have had glasses fitted long ago . I had not thought of this before and I went down the next day to see an oculist . It was a week before I could really see out of the glasses he fitted for me and then it was as if I had discovered a new world . Trees , grasses , the spread of a bird 's wing , the shadow of a leaf upon water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time had been growingdim were restored and with a new lustre . In my newfoundexuberance I hunted more than usual that fall . My legs gave way under the strain . My right leg , always the weaker , developed a cramp from which I suffer to this day . It was not so bad while I was actually in the field . It came on me at night , usually with a sharp premonitory twinge . The twinge would not last but it would be followed by a dull ache that persisted often a whole night through . Lying awake and tossing in my bed I would think sometimes that I paid a corresponding amount of pain for every minute 's pleasure inp175the field . And yet it had not occurred to me that I could give up hunting . I do not suppose that coincidence has played a greater part in my life than in that of the average man and yet it has always seemed strange to me that it was in this same year that I met Colonel Wyndham . It was in the early spring . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tom Fayerlee and Joe Moseley . We had concluded our business and towards twelve o'clock dropped into the Latham Hotel for dinner . A spare , blue-eyed man of about sixty was sitting at a table just inside the door . He looked up as we came in . Something about the man 's face was familiar but I could not place him among any acquaintances in Hopkinsville or any of the neighboring towns . We sat down and ordered our dinner . Tom and Joe were in the midst of a trade . I knew all about the qualities of the mare that Tom was trying to trade sight unseen to Joe for a jack and I listened absently , replying only when I was called upon for a verification of some statement . The elderly blueeyedman looked up from his steak once and smiled slightly as the voices of the traders grew louder and I wondered again where it was I had seen him before . They had concluded the trade . Tom was ejaculating " As she stands ? " and Joe had his lips pursed for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A Colonel Wyndham . I had seen him twenty years ago on West Fork . It was in February and John Garland 's ten-acre barn was full of niggersstripping tobacco . I had been talking to John when a tobacco buyer had driven up in a buggy . John had gone to the barn door to meet him and they had stood there talking awhile , then the buyer went off and John came back to superintend the stripping . Half an hour later I left the barn and went down to the creek . There is a beautiful pool just below John 's house , the Blue Hole the niggers call it . Two hundred feet long and above it a fine riffle breaking over a rocky ledge . As I came down the path I saw a gray hat bobbing above the bushes and wondered what other fisherman could be at my hole . The man , a stranger , was sitting on a stump drawing on a pair of Scotch waders . He stepped out now into the riffle at the foot of the pool . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fishermen in our neighborhood at that time  --  he began casting , thirty feet every time and the fly lighting on the water soft as a rose leaf . I walked on down to the bank in order to observe him more closely . He had got above the pool now . Standing in the middle of the stream he was casting thirty feet to a rocky ledge . The fly would just brush the ledge and fall off . He repeated the manoeuvre over and over and I saw that he was imitating the action with which an insect blundering into some object on the bank will fall into the water . I was by this time greatly excited . I had never before seen a man casting with such skill and I wanted to talk with him . I called out but he evidently did not hear me for he acceleratedhis pace just then and a few minutes later stepped out on the opposite bank and started up the path . I called again . But there was no answer . As I watched him disappear through the undergrowth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim had been talking to a few minutes ago and that he was even then taking the short cut over to Ben Pollard 's barn to look at his tobacco . I hurried on back to the barn . Jim said that the man was doubtless Colonel Wyndham , the English tobacco buyer who had been there that morning . He had heard that he was ap177great fisherman . If anybody was casting down there it was him all right . We hitched up Old Polly and drove over to Ben Pollard 's . But the tobacco buyer had stayed there a few minutes and had gone on . , Ben had heard him say that he was going to Louisville that night . No , he did n't know when he 'd be back ... . Tom and young Moseley were ready to go . The spare , elderly man had lit a cigar , too , and was rising . I caught upwith him just as he was passing through the swinging door . He turned around in astonishment as I laid a hand on his arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crazy but I want to talk to you . ... I 've been wanting to talk to you for twenty years ... " We spent the morning together , talking . That afternoon he gave me a demonstration of the skill that so long ago had aroused my admiration . We went out on the street and standing there , his back to a high brick wall , he dry cast , gently angling the fly until he put it repeatedly under first one wheel and then another of a wagon that was drawn up across the street . I tried it myself later and could only laugh at my bungling attempts . The colonel , however , was inclined to be deprecatory of his skill . " It 's my old father , had me casting a fly in the river Lea when I was in kilts , you might say . . . . You must put a book under your arm . It 'll come to you then . " I went to see him often after that . I can not remember ever going out with him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pilgrimage to Hopkinsville every Saturday . Those were the days before automobiles . I rode the twenty miles on horseback , starting after the heat of the day was over . I usually passed the Warrens ' , cousins of Molly 's , about six o'clock and would go in and eat supper with them . I did not tarry after enjoying their hospitality but would get on my horse and ride on into Hopkinsville . The colonel would have finished his supper and would be out on the little screened-in front porch . Moths attracted by the light in the hall would keep up a continual flutter against the wire screen . He would get up sometimes and picking up a moth , examine it carefully , he was extraordinarily curious about all forms of insect life  --  before he resumed his discourse . It is long ago and many things have gone through my head since then but I hear his voice as if it were yesterday , can remember even the little turns of his speech : " It is all in the wrist . A young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main strength . I always make them put a book under their arm . They have to use their wrists then . . . " He liked to talk about his art in general terms , to set forth clearly and succinctly its fundamentals : " The art of fly casting is to place the fly before the trout or bass , keeping him in complete ignorance of yourself , your rod and line . That is all there is to it . " He would say this and chuckle faintly , knowing how very much more there was . Or he would add musingly : " Delicacy and accuracy . Those are the prime requisites . You 've got to drop your fly on the water softly . The fish can tell the difference . You drag a saturated mass of hackles and feathers through the water and a bass wo n't take it unless he is very hungry . . . It is the hackle that gives life . You must do it with a series of short , hesitating jerks , with a quiver to the wrist . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and move it in the dim light so that I could observe the precise action . Unemotional , rather pedantic discourse that might to the average man have seemed tiresome but even now recalling his words the old fascination comes over me and I am a young man again , sitting there in the dim light of the porch listening to the Colonel talk about the black bass . . . . " A very wanton fish . He ca n't see even a small minnow go byp179without snapping at it . And he is the most voracious and fearless of them all . I 've had bass follow me snapping at an empty hook . " And there was the experiment that led to the making of his famous Wyndham 's Fancy . " There were two of us , Sir , who had this argument for some time . We were both agreed that it is curiosity rather than appetite or pugnacity that makes a bass strike . But we disagreed on what it was he struck at . Hawkins said it was form , I thought it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the old Des Plaines River that in those days was full of bass . We went out to an old covered bridge ; there was space between the planks through which you could see the water . One man went ahead , casting , one watched through the planks in the bridge . I had dyed a lot of hackles and wrapped them around a match with the merest sliver of lead , just enough to make them sink . The form of each fly was the same but the colors were varied . Yellow seemed not to have much lure for them , green was not much better ; they would come up and mumble it and then drop it ; but red was very provocative . It was then that I got the idea for my Wyndham 's Fancy . I made it out of the herl of a peacock 's wing and one bright strand of crimson wool . " He was full of information on unexpected subjects . Once I said to him : " Colonel , I can take any fish with a fly except @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He laughed his quiet , rather gentle laugh . " Neither could I till I learned how . " He then told me how he had learned to catch crappie when he was wading waist deep in a lake in Christian County and catching mostly small bass . " I knew there were crappie there but cast as I would I could never get one . I was using a No. 2 spinner and a cut of Al Foss pork rind . The bass were taking it greedily but I wanted crappie for a change . I castp18o and cast and never got one , then as sometimes happens to me , on a long cast , my line fouled . There was nothing to do but straighten it out . It took me some minutes and the lure naturally sunk to the bottom . When I picked it up to retrieve it I got a strike and landed a pound crappie . I said I 'll try that again . ' I made a long cast , let the line sink almost to the bottom and got another one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that day . I had learned the trick . He is a midwaterbiter and hardly ever rises to the top . Therefore in known crappie water let your line sink and watch it . If it deflects the slightest to the right or the left , at once set the hook : if the fish goes straight ahead the fish will hook itself . " I asked him once how it was that he did n't care for hunting . " I do n't know , " he said vaguely . " I got started fishing early in life  --  I must have been seven years old when I tied my first fly  --  and you know , " this with a chuckle , " how the time goes when a man gets interested in fishing . No , Maury . . . " and he looked out on the dim-lit street and pursed his lips reflectively . " You 're young and you do n't realize it yet , but there is n't time enough . . . . There is n't time enough . " * * *I glanced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the front row Cayce Simms ' droning voice still went on . " I saw a third  --  I heard his voiceIt is the hermit good ! He singeth loud his godly hymnsThat he makes in the wood . He 'll shrieve my soul : he 'll wash away ... " He halted , fixing an enquiring eye on mine . " Albatross , " I said absently . " I 've told you how to pronounce that word three hundred and fifty times , Cayce. "  |p181Alert  little Benny Anderson grinned . His eyes shifted from the clock face to me . His lips moving softly framed the words : " Going out this afternoon , ' Fessor ? " I shook my head sternly , looked down at the book where the black letters seemed to dance in a gray mist . Part VII came next but Cayce would never make it today . His mouth opened and shut slowly . His right shoulder twitched , sure sign that he was about to stall again . I snapped the book shut . " School dismissed . Cayce Simms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Albatross ' or Mariner ' I 'm going to give you a good licking . " The windows rattled as fifty benches were pushed back in unison . There was the sound of rapid , stumbling feet in the aisles . The boys were gone , pell-mell out of the door that gave onto the playground . I was alone in the schoolroom . I yawned and stretched myself . The last hour was the worst . No , the last two hours . I could get through somehow up to twelve o'clock . There was the break for lunch then and the post prandial daze . But around one o'clock I always came to with heightened sensibilities so that sitting there looking about the schoolroom I would notice things that as a rule did n't bother me : the wart on Sidney Travers ' nose , the unchanging dirtiness of Joe Simmons ' hands , his snuffle that came with the regularity of a clock 's ticking and that against my will I found myself waiting for . These things in my mood of the last few months had become @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walked out onto the front verandah . The house faced the wrong way  --  due west  --  and at this time of day the whole street was bathed in a fierce mid-afternoon light . But the great knotted wistaria vine that clambered up one of the pillars cast a deep shade on the north end of the porch . My own big split-bottom chair stood there , the smoking-stand that held my pipes and tobacco drawn up nearby . I sat down , filled my pipe and lit it . The setter , Bob , came out from under the porch wagging his plumey tail and took his place at my feet . I regarded him dispassionately . It had been many months now since he had been in the field . It was n't necessary for him to quit hunting even if I myself had to give it up . Shifting myself in my chair I wondered if it were too late to go out to West Fork . For weeks now I had been going out there every afternoon , casting . I had taken Colonel Wyndham at his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not anything else in the house thick enough , had gone with me every afternoon till recently . I did not need it any longer . My wrist had suddenly grown flexible . I could cast forty feet now and make the fly hit the water first every time . But I was getting tired of fishing the same pools over and over . West Fork , I knew every inch of it from Christian County to Red River . Spring Creek , too . And the river was no good . A man could cast all day there and never take anything . My thoughts went to a conversation a day or so ago with Colonel Wyndham about the rivers of the Ozark country . Mountain streams with swift reaches , ending sometimes in shallows , sometimes in the deep pools that are the chosen home of the Little Mouth . . . . Virgin forests bordering these streams . . . Gigantic pecan trees , centuries old , black birch . . . Timber wolves were still at large in those forests , he said , and black @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . The door opened and Sally came out on the porch . As she crossed the open space in front of me I noticed that her skirts had suddenly grown longer and that the black rope/like braids that until recently had hung over her shoulders were done up now at the back of her head . As she esconced herself in the swing and opened her book she bent a severe grown-up look upon me . " Daddy , Mother said tell you if you were n't going fishing this afternoon you ought to answer Uncle Harry 's letter . " The intimacy that had existed between ourselves and the Morrows back in the Mississippi days had been kept up after a fashion in the letters that passed back and forth between Molly and Flora . I remembered vaguely now that Harry himself had written some weeks ago . He had just become the president of a small college somewhere and thought , Molly said , for I myself had not read the letter , that he could give me a place on the faculty if I was interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now and smoothed it out upon my knee , then almost jumped out of my skin when I saw the postmark : " Poplar Bluff , Missouri . " Colonel Wyndham had mentioned the Black River at Poplar Bluff as his favorite of all the Ozark streams.  |p187WIRED  Harry Morrow that afternoon : " Will come PoplarBluff if you can give me only morning classes . " His answer came the next morning : " Two classes of Latin , two of Greek . No classes after twelve . Fine fishing on most beautiful river in Southwest . When can you come ? " Molly had said that it would take a month , anyhow , to wind up affairs in Gloversville . But Molly was ever better in performance than promise . It took less than three weeks . They were strenuous weeks . It is hard to leave any house where you have lived for ten years . I had not realized how much heart-break would be involved in it . I remember that a whole day was given over to deciding the fate of Sally 's yellow cat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the black horse , Jeff , was to be sent out to Merry Point . Being a town cat , he was restless there and roamed , coming , I believe , to an untoward fate in an encounter with three dogs . I do n't believe Sally has forgiven me for it to this day but I had steeled myself to go through with the thing and I stood firm through it all . I would be dead , I told them , in another year if I had to stay in Gloversville . The question was whether they preferred me alive in Poplar Bluff or dead in Gloversville . Sally , being young , laughed when I said this but Molly knew me well enough by this time to know there was some truth in what I said . Dingo 's fate having been settled , there was the question of whether Sally should accompany us to Poplar Bluff or go on and enter a girls ' school in Nashville as had been previouslyp188planned . Molly finally decided that she should go to the school in Nashville . We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The river , this with a quiet smile , might not be all we hoped . We might be moving again soon . There was no use dragging the child over the country at the heels of such wandering parents . I agreed . We were alone when we boarded the train that Monday morning in August . Molly was exhausted by the last-minute horrors of packingand the grief of parting from Sally , and she reclined silently in her chair all morning . A nap in the morning refreshedher somewhat . By dinner time she had rallied enough to indulge in speculation about the Morrow family . She wondered what Harry was like now . It was nearly fifteen years since we had seen him . He was bound to have changed , still Harry was the kind of person who did n't change much fundamentally ... . I gave what attention I could to her speculations but Harry 's character had never interested me much . I felt as if he were , say , a pollywog that one had thrown into a pool . One would throw him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he had developed an eye or two and a pair of gills and was in the process of becoming a frog . Another week and he would have a pair of legs and be paddling about . He would turn eventually into a frog for whom one might come to feel a certain degree of attachment . But as for interest in his development , I had none ; it needed only sufficient knowledge of natural history to predict its every stage . So , leaning back in my chair after dinner and watching the green countryside flow by , I was not so much occupied with the changes that might have come over Harry as in wonderingwhat this new place would be like . That afternoon in the smoker I fell into conversation with a man , a drummer , who made Poplar Bluff twice a month and was familiar with all that country , a fat man whop189breathed stertorously and waved his cigar as he gave me a circumstantial description of the country round Poplar Bluff .... The land between Black River and the St. Francis River had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was formed . The river ran upstream for weeks , tradition said . In recent years the state of Missouri had passed a law calling for the digging of a canal every quarter of a mile through the overflowed country . I was elated to hear this . Those canals would be perfect breeding places for bass . People think that the streams in cultivated countries are devoid of fish because of seining or dynamiting or the increase of predatory fish like gar and big cat . But this is not the case . The bass die  --  or never hatch  --  for lack of oxygen . All game fish are ground nesters . The eggs are alive when they are laid and the bass hover over them taking turns fanning them with their tails to supply fresh water to the eggs . In a cultivated country every rise is a muddy rise . An hour after a heavy rain every egg in the nest is dead . Sediment has filtered down upon them and shut off the oxygen . Hence few fish are hatched in cultivatedcountry . But this land @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was no headwater , the water in those canals would be seep-water and perfectly clear . A natural breeding place for fish . . . . Later I walked along the banks of the canals in hatching season and looking down into the clear water saw millions of the little bass that would eventually find their way into Black River , into Current and White .... We were still talking excitedly when the conductor shouted " Poplar Bluff , " and Molly and I called the porter and hurried out on the platform.  |p190I  saw first a gentle eminence crowned by the college buildings . The whole slope was covered with trees , poplars , to my surprise , still predominating among them . Their trunks were black against the red brick of the buildings . At the foot of the wooded slope , pushing up to the very edge of the bold bluff wound the Black River . I have rarely seen a more beautiful situation or one better suited to my purposes . I had given our baggage checks to a porter and was stepping over to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the water when Molly laid her hand on my arm . " There 's Harry , " she said . I turned back  --  recalled to some sense of the proprieties  --  to meet Harry already making his way through the crowd . He was stouter than he had been fifteen years ago but I did not think he had changed much . It startled me to see on his blond features exactly the same expression of jovial calm , though the pince-nez which in the old days had given it glitter were replaced now by octagonal-shaped , rimless glasses . His pleasure at seeing us was unmistakable . " Well , Professor , " he said boyishly . " Well "  --  and he pattedme on the shoulder  --  " if it is n't good to see you . " He insisted on seeing to our luggage himself , then installedus in his car . People  --  people in our rank of life  --  were just beginning to discard horses for automobiles ; I do not believe I had ridden in an automobile half a dozen times before in my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down a side street one occasionally got glimpses of the river . It looked black in the fading light . I asked Harry what kind of water it was , and my spirits rose at his description : a clear mountain stream with swift reaches that always ended in deep pools , some of them a mile long . We had passed through the town and were starting up the winding campus drive . I was surprised at the magnificentp191trees and the well-kept appearance of the shrubbery . There were evidences of attempts at landscape gardening on the lower slopes , an unusual feature in a small college campus in those days . I commented on this . Harry , smiling reticently , said that Rodman was very well endowed . We approached the president 's mansion . It was a large , commodious house , built of gray stone and surrounded by well-kept flower beds , obviously erected in a later period than the rest of the college buildings . Flora , on the porch cutting some late roses , dropped her shears and came forward to meet us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I remembered that I had always thought she had a charming smile and that Molly , though she had never much liked her , had always insisted that she was worth two of Harry any day . The house was furnished in keeping with Harry 's new magnificence . He took us on a tour of it which ended in the bathroom . Modern bathrooms were rare in those days . Harry was particularly proud of his porcelain tub ; I shared his admiration . The tub at Gloversville had been of zinc ; Molly had made me paint it time and again but the zinc always ate through the paint in short order . We sat down at seven o'clock to an excellent supper  --  roast duck with savory stuffing and for dessert a special apple tart that Flora had made for us in the old days . During the meal Harry talked about the college and his plans for it . Rodman , he said , was " the coming college of the West . " They had very good buildings and equipment but they would have better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be substantially increased within the coming year . We would see then what a small college with a strong faculty and a good endowment behind it could do . " Where 's the money coming from for all this ? " I asked  |p192He  smiled mysteriously and observed that there were ' plenty of people willing and anxious to give money " if they ' were properly approached . " I could not help saying as I ate my last bite of apple tart ' that I did n't know anybody who had a talent for approaching people more properly than Harry and he seemed pleased at the compliment , though Molly gave me a slight frown from across the table . After dinner Molly and Flora went upstairs and Harry and I sat down in his study , a small room off the back hall . Harry , expansive over his excellent cigar , described the Rodmansituation in more detail . There was , he admitted , one difficulty in the way of his plans , a slight rift in the faculty . A group headed by Crosman , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his aims . Another faction headed by the chemistry professor was not so sympathetic , slightly hostile , in fact . " Still honing after that oldfossil , Taylor , " he explained . " Well , " I said , " I imagine you 'll be able to deal them all right . " He said , smiling confidently , that he thought he would be . " You see , Professor , I hold the trump card . I have Selby 's ear . In fact , " he added reflectively , " I have both Selby 's ears . " ' ' - I had never heard of that worthy . Harry , however , soon set me right . Lawson Selby was one of those modern geniuses  --  genius was the word he used  --  with constructive imagination . He had already built several railroads and had been responsible for the development of at least one town in the Southwest . But he still yearned for more fields to conquer . He had come now in his later middle years to live in his old home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man should take an interest in the college in his town ? There was , too , Harry indicated delicately , another reason for hisp193growing interest in Rodman . In certain quarters there was prejudice against Selby . A man who had piled up more than a million dollars had made enemies doing it , naturally ; well , there was no better way for a millionaire to dispel enmity or to gain a certain kind of prestige than by giving lavishly to educational institutions . I saw the whole situation then very clearly , a situation it seemed to me made for Harry 's peculiar talents . " Right you are , my boy , " I said heartily , " if you can play him . " Harry , smiling his candid smile which had always had for me a certain charm , said that he thought he could . I could not but agree with him . A few minutes later Crosman , the mathematics professor , the head I remembered of Harry 's faction , arrived . We chatted desultorily a few minutes , then Crosman said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door and I heard their voices in low-toned conversation for another quarter of an hour . I strolled out on the porch and surveyed the night . The slope was dark except for a few lights here and there but the lights of the town were a brilliant band encircling the hill . And below was the broad unilluminated band which I knew was the river . I would have liked to go down now through the town to look at it more closely . Everything in good time , I told myself . I was in a good place  --  I knew it already though I had not been within a stone 's throw of the water . Tomorrow and the next day , perhaps the day after that , would be taken up with school matters ; but I could wait . The river would be all the better . I heard Harry 's steps coming back through the hall and I went back into the study . We talked a half hour longer , then Molly and Flora came in . It was a pleasant evening , warm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It was quite evident that Harry , as I had once said of him , knew exactly where he was going . And it was evident too that he proposed taking me , unwieldy baggage as I might prove , along with him . I felt agreeably relaxed and hopeful as I prepared for bed . But looking back from the distance of years two incidents rather out of keeping with the general tone of the evening stand out : The first was when we were dressing for supper . It seemed to me Molly was unusually particular about my appearance that night . She insisted on tying my cravat herself and then came back once or twice to set it properly . " What are you making such a fuss for ? " I asked . " We 're not dining with the president . " She did not answer for a minute , then she came and laid her hand on my arm . " Do n't you see , darling ? You 've got to impress Harry ... " She did not finish the sentence but I knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or he 'll be wanting a younger man . " I detached her arm gently and went on about my dressing . I was more shaken by what she had intimated than I wanted her to know . I do n't suppose I am slower witted than the average man and certainly few men are more apprehensive of the future . For years now I had been dreading old age but when I thought of it , it was only in connection with my sport . I had feared only what Doctor Johnson calls the stoppageof " the passages of joy . " It had actually never occurred to me before that a whippersnapper like Harry Morrow might think I was getting too old to teach in his mushroom college . . . . The other incident occurred when I returned to the study after my turn on the porch . Harry was still closeted with Crosman . Before he left he had been showing me some tackle he had just bought . There was a beautiful black enamelled tapered hundred-foot fly line . It lay on the tablep195now , snarled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell rang . I picked it up , ran the end of the line through my fingers and wrapped it back smoothly on the card . The play of the silk was agreeable , I found my fingers lingering on it as I spooled it . Then a moment after I had laid it down I picked it up again . I held the card in my open palm a moment , then slipped it into my pocket and quietly resumed my pacing about the room . Years later when I remembered this , the only theft I ever perpetrated in my life , I was embarrassed . But at the time I remember feeling only an agreeable sense of having executed justice . It did not seem right for a fellow like Harry Morrow to have a line as good as that . The next morning Flora went with us to look at our new house . There was at that time but one house on the campus vacant , the little brown cottage which had been the home of the old Latin professor whose place I was taking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it were at all possible so we walked forth now to inspect it . There are times in a man 's life when he seems to discern some pattern in the events that have been going on , apparentlyso erratically . I felt that way when I first saw that cottage . It seemed to me that Fate , if she had all this time been preparing such a place for me , might be forgiven many a minor blow dealt over a long period of years . It stood on the very edge of the campus property , small , painted a dingy brown , rose-embowered . It had other advantagesand disadvantages . I came to know them well later but in that first flush I could see nothing , could think nothing but that here was the house that suited me better than any house I had ever seen before in my life . Molly and Flora had gone on through the hall and back into the kitchen . I could hear their voices now , voluble but subdued as I stood there on the porch and sized up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and west  --  perched on the very edge of a promontory . What yard there was sloped up behind it towards the campus . The porch ran around two sides of the cottage . One side looked off over a discreet stretch of lawn  --  the college handy man was conscientious about his mowing and this stretch was always neatly barbered . It culminated , I believe , in the hedge which screened the chemistry professor 's back premises but I can not at this date be sure of that for I do n't think I ever let my eye rest on that neat , shaven stretch for more than a split second at a time . It was to the south I looked always , to the river . It lay , seemingly almost immediately beneath us , a wide , still pool , fringed with giant sycamores and hickories , shining in the morning sun . Its stillness and the fact that a sand pit ran far out from the left bank gave it momentarily the appearance of being a body of enclosed water . The impression , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was extraordinarilydeep and still but just above it was one of the swiftest , most vicious rapids I have ever tried to wade . I came to know it well from Poplar Bluff up to the Big Eddy and as far below , but I never came out on that porch and looked down upon that water that I did not have for a second that feeling of looking down upon a lake . I believe that fleeting , recurrent impression was one of the minor charms among the many that that river had for me . I liked to sit on my porch and meditate on its deceptiveness . I walked now to the far end of the porch and looked down on the rear premises . Here was a feature of the landscape that excited me almost as much as the proximity to the river . The cottage was not only the last house on the campus but the last house in the whole town on that side of the river . They had managed to make the approach and the scrap ofp197front yard presentable but nothing had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not two hundred feet from the house . I had only to go out my own back door and drop down a path  --  I thought I could discern glimpses of it through the sumac and buckberry bushes  --  and I would be at the river without going through anybody 's back yard or exposingmyself to gossip . ( This last reflection was borrowed from Molly . She had already begun to be a little sensitive about my spending so much time on my fishing and she did not like for people to see me in my fishing clothes . ) Molly and Flora , still talking about pantries , closets and sleeping quarters , had come back through the hall and stood now on the front porch . " You 'll like being so near the river , Professor , " Flora said smiling . I saw a doubtful look come over Molly 's face . It was her theory that , left to myself , I would very soon revert to savagery  --  andshe was careful to keep me in as much servitude to civilization as she possibly could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this cottage was too much to my liking and I racked my brain for some flaw I could find with it . " Are you sure it 's big enough ? " was the best I could muster . Molly settled that very quickly . " It 's Hobson 's choice , Professor Maury , " she said with a touch of asperity . " Did n't you hear Flora say that there was n't another house on the campus that we could rent ? Or would you rather go out in town and rent a house ? " I said meekly that I would rather be on the campus , near my work , and followed the ladies up the winding brick walk to the president 's mansion , not omitting to thank God as I went through its stately portals that it was Harry Morrow and not I who had to live among its magnificences.  | On Wednesday we moved into the brown cottage . The rest of that week we were busy getting settled . I met my classes  --  there were two Latin classes , and two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through by twelve o'clock as Harry had promised . Molly did not like this part of it . She said she did not like Harry to manoeuvre things so that I could have less work than the other professors . I assured her that Harry had done nothing of the kind . Young men , I said , did not take kindly to the Humanities these days . It was an evil of the times and neither Harry nor I was to blame . Poor Molly had always wished that I would take more interest in my work but I could not do it even for her . My feelings were , perhaps , reprehensible but they were practical . Very soon in my career I realized that Latin and Greek were dead languages in more ways than one . I myself had loved them in my youth and I would instruct young men in them as long as any young men could be found who desired instructionbut it was becoming more apparent all the time that fewer and fewer young men desired instruction . But I was not thinking of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took my rod and tackle box and started down the path to the river . I had not gone far before I came upon a cabin . It stood in the shade of three magnificent hickory trees . The little plot in front of it was worn bare by the restless feet of half a dozen children who were even then chasing one another around the corner of the house . In a corner of the yard a sharp-featured old man in blue overalls sat mending a seine . I raised my hand in salute as I passed but he merely lifted his head to favor me with a baleful glance before returning to his work . I wondered a little at his ill-humor  --  river rats usually take to me  --  but I had other more important things on my mind that afternoon and wasted no more thought on the old fellow as I hurried on down to the river.  |p199I  was delighted to find that the descent was gradual . In fishing West Fork and its sister stream , Spring Creek , I had always had to push my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad business for a man as heavy on his feet as I then was . But these banks sloped gently all the way down to the water 's edge and were moreover as clean of undergrowth as if they had been in a park . The trees , every time I looked up , aroused my admiration . They were gigantic , hickory , pecan , oak , most of them virgin growth . I emerged from among them . The river was before me . Standing there I examined the prospect . There were swift reaches above and below but along here the water lay in a deep pool . The sand bar on which I was standing continued , I found later , for almost a mile along that bank . On the other side a limestone bluff towered a hundred feet in air . In its shadow the water was a deep cerulean , almost black . This kind of water is the chosen home of the Little Mouth . I thought of Colonel Wyndham and hoped he would live to a green old age and prosper as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had led me to this Paradise . I put on a No. 3 spinner , black gnat , tied on with No. 4 bronze hook and started in . It was hip deep within three feet of the bank but I managed to keep my footing and waded about for an hour or so , not casting hard , just getting my bearings . I took three sizable Little Mouth and a couple of bream . By that time I had waded a good way up the river . It was no place for wading . The . bottom shelved every now and then abruptly ; once or twice I stepped off into holes that were over my head . The conviction grew on me that I would have to have a boat if I were to do any fishing here . I was tired by this time so I got out and sat down on the bank to smoke and cogitate on the problem . A john-boat would not do . It would take a pretty good little craft to negotiate these rapids . And then there was the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would have to go up at least twenty or thirty miles . I would have to get somebody to tow me up in a motorboat and then drift back , and that would be troublesome , and expensive ... . My eye roving over the scene fell just then on a motorboat anchored a few hundred yards downstream . I regarded it without interest  --  I have always hated the things  --  but there was something about the little boat tied up to it that took the eye and I got up and went over to see it better . I was rewardedfor my pains . It was one of the most beautiful objectsI have ever beheld : eighteen feet long , four wide , lightly curved and riding the water as gracefully as a swan . I was so pleased with its appearance that I let out a whistle and spoke aloud , a bad habit I have formed from being so much alone . " God Almighty , " I said , " if that ai n't something ! " I had gone closer and was about to step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ examine the other boat when a rustling in the bushes made me turn . The seine mender was coming slowly down the path . His gray eyes under bushy brows were trained right on me . I knew then that this was his boat . And he did not look to me like the kind of man who liked to have his things fooled with . I relinquished my idea of stepping down into the motorboat and stayed on the bank until he had come up to me . I spoke then : " That 's the prettiest boat I ever saw . What 's it made of ? " " Sassafras . " He had stepped into the motorboat and now lifting the anchor sent the little boat shooting over towards me . I bent and examined it . " Man , " I said , " how 'd you ever put it together ? " His grim features relaxed somewhat . " I glued hit , " he said , " hit tuck me the best part of two weeks . " I saw that he was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The sassafras is the lightest of all native woods and an excellent material for boats but you can rarely get a strip that is over an inch wide . ) " Well , " I said , " it sure is a beauty . What 'll you charge to take me up the river in it ? " He took his pipe out of his mouth . " Four dollars , " he said . I let out a whistle of astonishment . " Man , that 's money ! " He leaned over and knocked the pipe out against the boat side . " Well , " he said , " I ai n't got no objection to anybody else taking you . Thar 's Alf Greer , he takes folks up some-times . " " Has he got a good boat ? " " Hit 'll git you up the river . " " And what does he charge ? " " Three dollars and a half . " " Where does he live ? " He jerked his thumb over his shoulder , downstream . " In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the smoke . " " Well , " I said , " I reckon I 'll go over and talk to Alf . " I got up and had proceeded some distance along the path when the graven image on the boat brow spoke : " Alf , he ai n't like me ... " I turned around . " You mean he ai n't as big a cutthroat ? " " You kin put it like that , " he said composedly . " Now me , when I take a feller up the river , I make him a price and he kin take it or leave it . Alf , he 'll charge you three dollars and a half . But he expects something on the side . And it 's fifty cents extry if it rains and a quarter extry if you get above the Big Eddy ... " I came back and sat down again . " What you mean is that you charge four dollars and Alf charges four and a half ? " I said . " And between you what is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pipe again and he looked out now over the blue rippling water . " Well , " he said , " I reckon he kin stay at home . " I believe that I taught my classes acceptably enough duringthe next four or five days but my mind all the time was occupied with one problem : how in the devil was I to get up that river far enough to get any fishing ? I had gone down the next afternoon and had talked to Alf Greer and to anotherriver rat named Elkins and had found that old George was right . Both of them had a price that slightly undercut his but the extras ran it above four dollars ... . Four dollars ! I could not afford one trip up the river at that price . There were the moving expenses still to pay and the bill for Sally 's tuition had come in only that morning . It would pinch us now to get through the month . The time was to come when I would be free from money worries , would have means enough at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it was not here yet . . . Four dollars . . . I said it over and over to myself and thought despairingly that it might as well have been four hundred ... . It was maddening , to be living here on the likeliest water I had ever seen and not to be able to take advantage of it . I have learned one or two things , however , in the course of a long life ; one of them is to be patient , the other is to go ahead sometimes on faith . Providence had led me to this perfect spot . I could not believe it was to be in vain , so the rest of that fall I idled along waiting for things to shape themselves . I do n't mean that I was n't getting in any fishing . There were Burn Lorenz , Moke Waterhouse , Harry Dalzell ; any one of these men was glad to take me up the river in his boat any time I would go with him . I suppose I averaged three afternoons a week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same as being " organized " for myself . I had developedby this time into the kind of man who likes to go fishing alone . It had been years since I had gone out with these great roistering groups of men and I found that I liked it even less than I had in my youth . Burn Lorenz accused me once of liking to go alone because I did not want anybody to get onto my methods and I suppose there was some truth in what he said . I know that I found it irksome to answer a lot of questions , as to why I tied my line a certain way or preferred this fly to that . I had my methods . It had taken me years of persistent experiment to come by some of them . And I did not care to share my knowledge with anybody else . I do not believe that I have mentioned the fact that here on this water I was casting better than I ever had before . The only fly in the ointment was the fact that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to and often had to content myself with an afternoon 's wading along the bank . It was about this time that a river rat named Jim Shelton began dredging sand . His barge went up the river every morning at eight o'clock . It was no good to me , of course , in the afternoons , but on Saturdays I could hook on  --  I had bought myself a tight little john-boat by this time  --  and manage to get fifteen or twenty miles up the river . It was one Saturday in September that I made the discoverythat revolutionized my life at Poplar Bluff . I had gone up the river with Jim early in the morning and had started drifting back . For some time now I had taken nothing but bream and I wondered why it was when suddenly I saw something that made my eyes pop out of my head . The water of that stream is always clear . Today it was unusually so . I looked down and saw in that pellucid water literally hundreds and hundreds of bream nests . There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side of a shelvingbar . I saw at once what was happening . The bream , like all perch fish , are promiscuous . Mating and spawning are community affairs and hundreds of fish use the same nest . Those nests are a beautiful sight . They take the sharp erectile belly fin and cut up the bottom , then fan the mud away with fin and tail until they reach clear sand . Sometimes the nest is four feet across and a foot deep and always as round as a ball . They use the same nest two or three times a season , for bream in some climates spawn as often as four times a year . These bream were not striking of course , but whenever my fly lit on the water one , sometimes two bream would rush forward and drag it away from the long row of nests . In the process one at least always got hooked . I tried it again and again , always with success . I could have taken hundreds right there on that bar . I contented myself with three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That evening as usual I passed Old George 's house on my way up to the cottage . It had become a custom now for me to sing out always as I passed : " Hey , Old Man , what 'll you take me up the river for ? " George 's answer delivered in exactly the same growl was always " Four dollars , " " to which I replied : " Man , that 's money ! " or , " You durned old skin-flint ! " according to the mood I happened to be in . But this evening after our usual repartee I paused . George was sitting under his sycamore tree mending a trap . He was a professional fisherman as well as boatman and made a good part of his living selling the fish he took in these traps . I went in now and sat down beside him and we smoked in silence for some minutes . " George , " I said finally , " will you take me up the river for the catch ? " George watched everybody who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likely to be more than the next man's.  |p205He  deliberated for some minutes , however , before he answered : " What you goin ' to ketch ? " " What do you get for these bream you sell here in town ? " I asked . " I git twenty-five cents a pound for every bream I kin git bolt of . " " Well , " I said firmly , " the catch 'll be bream . And I 'll guarantee there 'll be four dollars worth of ' em . If there is n't I 'll pay your boat hire . " George set the trap he was mending down and knocked the ashes out of his pipe . " I 'll take you up the river , " he said , " but you be ready to pay me four dollars . You ca n't ketch that many bream . " " What about trying it tomorrow ? " He gave his laconic assent and I went on up the hill , jubilant . My problem was solved . I had no doubt of catching the bream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next morning . George who had been giving me dark looks all the way up , suspecting me , perhaps , of seining or dynamiting the river , was obliged to leave me to attend to more profitable fares . I drifted on down at my leisure , having an excellent day 's sport on the way . I had taken three or four fine bass and some crappie when I arrived at the long shelving bar where the bream nests were . A young couple in a motorboat drifted by . They did not look as if they would know one fish from another but I waited till they were out of sight before I began work . I caught bream systematically for an hour or two . I believe I counted them , to be sure that George had his money 's worth , for I had decided to take neither more nor less than I needed . My conscience hurt me a little for taking them in the spawning season  --  it was the most unsportsmanlikething I ever did in my life , I suppose  --  but I salved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a game fish and spawning as he does three or four times ap206season is liable to overstock any water unless the surplus is taken out . I told myself this but I knew it really made no difference . It was me or the bream ; it would have killed me if I had n't been able to get out on that river . Old George had a boy , Curt , only fifteen years old but sharp as a steel trap , knew every rock and turn and lay-by in the river . His service was not so hard to come by as Old George 's so I fell into the habit of taking him along to paddle me back when I went up the river . There is one day that stands out in my memory . It was mid-April . We had got up long before day and George had taken us twenty or thirty miles up the river and now at seven o'clock he had left us and we were preparing to drift back . As I watched Curt handle the boat I congratulatedmyself on having chosen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ never seen a man handle a boat more dexterously than he did . He never took his paddle out of the water ; in his hands it moved like the fin of a gigantic fish . He was something of a fisherman himself and as George said was " judgmatical . " I did n't have to tell him a little farther out or a little closer in , he soon saw the length of line I was using and rowed accordingly . I was using a No. 3 spinner , black gnat tied on a No. 2 bronze hook . That would catch bream and crappie and the largest bass . I whipped the bank for a half hour or so but casting only at the likely places . Nine anglers out of ten exhaust themselves in useless casting . You rarely take a bass in open water . He is lying on the shady side of an open rock or under a sunken tree or a brush pile . My first strike was a bream , a female , easily a pound . Shep207gave me a splendid fight . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Curt , " I said , " pray for a riffle . Water 's too calm . " As if in answer to my prayer a faintly perceptible breeze arose , just the faintest shimmer on the water . I was laying out the line about thirty feet . There was a tremendous swirl , a tug . I set the hook . " Help me , Curt , " I cried . The bass was making for the open water . I cried again . " Dig in . " Curt sank the paddle mid-way and the boat leaped like a mettled horse . The bass was making a straightaway run , I grudgingly giving him foot after foot of line . We were in the middle of the river . The last foot of line was gone . " Curt , " I said , " ca n't you help me ? " Curt sank his paddle again , deeper this time . I gained two or three feet , then lost it . " It 's a Little Mouth , " I panted . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of struggle . He was showingsigns of weakening but I was not sure I had him . Finally the glorious moment came . He was at the top . He was turning over . I reeled him in . He was apparently lifeless but I was n't fooled . I know how they play possum when you get them to the side of the boat . " Curt , " I said , " he 's got another surge in him . Pick up that gaff but do n't try to gaff him in the head or the body . He 'll open his mouth . Plunge that gaff down his throat . " Curt stood ready with the gaff . The bass at the boatside did make another tremendous lunge . We lifted him in . A six-pounder . I was by this time in a perfect tremor of excitement . I told Curt I 'd have to rest a while and smoke to quiet my nerves . We drew up in the shade of some willows and rested , then started out again.  | Curt paddled me to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at it and knew that it was the hang-out of a big one  --  if I could only get a fly clear under it . I made several preliminary dry casts and then shot the line clear under the rock . It just grazed the edge as it went in . As it settled on the water a Little Mouth leaped . When I felt the strike I wished that I had been using the heavier rod . This was only three and a half ounces . But I did not have time to think about that any more . The battle was on . The Little Mouth as I have said rarely leaves the water . He bores straight down . Out in the current the water was fully fifty feet deep . And I had only twenty-five yards . He took it all . My heart in my mouth , I snubbed him . He seemed to pause . I got a yard or two and he came up . I retrieved nearly all the line ; he took it again . Five times he took every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the top , turned over and showed his gleaming white belly . I gently reeled him in , put my thumb and forefinger in his mouth and lifted him into the boat . He fell with a flop , so exhausted that he could not even move . I just sat there looking at him until Curt who never showed any emotion , no matter how big a fish you caught , asked if it was n't about time to eat lunch . We pulled the boat up on a sand bar and turned it over and sat on it while we ate ham sandwiches and apple pie washed down with black coffee from a thermos bottle . After lunch Curt threw himself down in the bottom of the boat and went to sleep . He fell asleep like that at odd times during the day with the suddenness of an animal . George said that he used up all his strength growing . It was one of those days when everything seemed bathed in fresh light . Here in the shade of the willows the water was a rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river where the sun struck an eddy it shimmered so brightly that I had to turn away my eyes . There was no sound anywherep209except Curt 's quiet breathing and the rushing of the water . Suddenly there was a plunge behind me . I turned , thinking it was a big bass . But it was a kingfisher coming up with a fish in his mouth . He gave his sharp , jittering cry and lit on a branch on the other side of the river . He sat there a few minutes swaying and was evidently about to make another plunge when suddenly he was off , a blue streak moving through the branches . I looked up and saw far over my head up in the blue a fish eagle careering slowly around and around with fixed pinions . Suddenly he folded his wings and dropped like a shot . The white foam flew . He had hit the water and was out again with a bass so big he could hardly fly with it . I watched him fly off slowly with laboring wings to his nest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretched and sat up . " Well , " he said , " let 's get going . " He paddled me over a swift reach to a pool that had always been a favorite of mine . It was fully sixty feet deep and a quarter of a mile long . The river moves in these pools with perceptible current but majestically . Curt knew well how to handle his boat in this water . He paddled me straight to a beautiful lay-by : a rock jutting two or three feet out of the water . I had expected to take bass here and I was not disappointed . The first was a pound and a half Little Mouth . A pound and a half Little Mouth is chicken hawk and chain lightning . They give you a much better fight than a larger Little Mouth . After that came a succession of bream and crappie and a rock bass or two . As the day went on the wind freshened till there was a strong riffle on the water . All Curt had to do was to keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bass  --  long ago . But I could not stop . I caught them on one side of the boat and turned them loose on the other . I must have caught a hundred and fifty bass that day . Finally I wearied . We were twelve miles from home by that time and the sun was already going down . " Curt , " I said , " I 'll take the oars and you take the paddle . Sometimes I do get low down enough to troll . " I put on a No. 2 guinea trail and let the line out a hundred feet behind me . I had forgot all about the troll when I got a strike so hard it almost stopped the boat . But the line held and after a struggle I landed a nine-pound Big Mouth . I reeled the rod up , laid it down in the boat and looked up at Curt , bronzed and immobile in the prow . " Boy , " I said , " there are some days a man never forgets . This is one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a white mark . " There was the day Harry Dalzell and I went up Current River . We took the six o'clock train  --  have I omitted to say that the Iron Mountain railroad runs parallel to the river for hundreds of miles ?  --  and got off at a little village called Arab and drove thirty miles to the headwaters of the Current . Harry who was a martinet went at once to see about the boat he had ordered made . I walked about on the platform and stretched my legs . In the field adjacent to the railroad property an old gray-bearded farmer and his boy were diggingpost-holes and I stood there watching them . Between intervals of post setting the old man looked up at me curiouslyout of deep-set crafty eyes . " How you goin ' to git down the river ? " he asked finally . I replied that Mr. Dalzell had had a boat made . " You goin ' to fish all the way ? " I nodded . Just then somebody called to me that the boat was ready and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ posthole digging and leapt up on the platform . He was shaking his fist and his chin beard waggled with suppressed fury.  | " I 'm sixty years old , " he yelled , " and I ai n't never went a-fishing in my life ! " I reflected as I turned away that people invariably make this damning statement with pride , though seldom with as much fury as this old fellow had got up over it . Well , I once knew a man who at forty was a virgin and proud of it but I never understood that either . The boat was being rolled on poles down to the water . I stood there with Harry and watched it go down . It looked like a box you make mortar in : sixteen feet long , eight feet wide and two feet high . Of two-inch heart-oak plank , put together with tenpenny nails and the cracks chinked solidly with oakum . It looked tight enough but I did n't see how we could manage to get any fishing from such an unwieldy craft . Harry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fellow , seemed to be satisfied with the boat , so I made no comment and followed him down the path . The guide was already at one of the sweeps and was motioning to Harry to take his place at the other . I had never seen a genuine Ozark red-neck before and I regarded this fellow with some curiosity . He was tanned a deep ochre color and he wore nothing but a ragged pair of pants which were cut off well above the knee . He could never have had the need for a hat ; the hair of his head was as matted and thick as the coat of some animal . I was reminded of the Scottish hero , Rob Roy , whose body if I remember right was covered all over with red hair like a red Highland bull 's . There was as much hair on this fellow 's face , certainly , as on the top of his head . From the midst of it a pair of very alert brown eyes looked out , as if from cover . Harry seemed particularly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the best guide round about here , raised up there on Roundrock , and knew every riffle and eddy in the river.  |p212Our  conversation was cut short by both of us falling suddenly to our knees . The boat was in the current and going like a shot . The guide manning the sweep called out shrill directions every now and then which we followed to the best of our ability . It seemed a touch-and-go business . I could not see how he could keep his bearings in that rushing water and I was never so relieved in my life as when he called out : " Good pool here . " He picked up a sixteen-foot pole armed with a steel pike and hook . Turning the sweep for the moment over to Harry he stood grasping the pole with both hands , then reached out and sank the hook into the sturdy trunks of a sycamore growingout into the stream . The timbers groaned as the boat came to a stop amid a rush of swirling water . I heaved a sigh of relief . " Well , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He looked up and seemed to be measuring me with his shrewd brown eyes . " Yep , " he said , " that 's the way to do it . " Harry was getting his fishing tackle out . I followed suit . I had brought my third best rod with me  --  Harry said we were sure to take some big ones and I had no intention of straining the Tucker Special which at that time was the pride of my life . I started off using a Royal Coachman but soon changed as usual to " Old Speck . " It was a beautiful pool , all right , and likely water . I took two three-pound Big Mouth besides some little fellows , and Harry had as good luck . We fished two more pools after that , one a quiet stretch made by a big bend in the river and the other a small pool on the edge of the swiftest , most vicious rapids I ever saw . I was by this time more used to our rushing progress down the river but I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dinner and told Ed to tie up at the next likely place . It was hard to find the right place . Ed finally had to sink his hook into a tree that grew out over the water and we had ap213time manoeuvring the unwieldy craft into the bank . We managed it finally and carried our cooking utensils and the fish we had caught ashore and cooked them over a fire made of hickory coals . Ed showed himself invaluable again . He was everywhere , broiling fish , stirring up hoe cake  --  I have never eaten better hoe cake in my life  --  boiling coffee and finally announcing dinner by a yoohooing that waked echoes in the forest for miles around . While we were eating he squatted on his haunches , a fish in one hand , a slab of hoe cake in the other . Between bites those alert animal eyes rested every now and then on me . I wondered why I was of such interest to the fellow . At two o'clock we got on the boat again . Ed , however , did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hook sunk in the trunk of the tree while he sauntered over to me carrying a large coil of three quarter rope with some kind of intricate harness lying on top of it . " Better let me buckle you up now , " he said . " Buckle me up ? " I said . " What in the devil for ? " The guide looked from me to Harry Dalzell . " He 's the biggest one , " he said unemotionally . Harry nodded and came up laughing to lay a hand on my shoulder . " We may get in a tight place and have to do some pulling , " he said . " Ed 's picked you because you 're the heaviestman . Let him put it on . He 'll show you what to do when the time comes . " I did not like the idea but I stood there and let the fellow buckle the harness on me . It fitted snugly over my shoulders , a broad belt about my back and a broader belt buckled in front across my chest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put across my forehead . As Ed finished buckling the last buckle he spoke laconically : " When I say Dig in , ' you dig in ! " He withdrew his hook from the tree . The boat moved slowly out for a few yards , then was caught by the current and we went whirling along at the same rapid pace we had kept before dinner . I was a little more used to it by this time , and managed to get in some nice casting when we stopped as we did three times that afternoon by deep blue pools . About four o'clock we approached a frowning cliff of rottenlimestone . High rises had washed out a great cavern in its side and there was only a narrow passage between the cliff and the opposite bank . It looked to me as pretty a little Scylla and Charybdis as ever I saw , sand bank to go aground on on one side , cavern to suck you in on the other . I did not see how even Ed 's skill could negotiate the dangerous passage . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to when suddenly he sank his hook into a big hickory and brought the boat to a creaking stop in what must have been twenty feet of swirling water . He went to the side of the boat and detaching the little axe he wore at his belt felled with one skilful blow a little poplar tree growing near the water 's edge . It fell just in front of the boat 's prow and was caught up at once by the current . We watched it whirl forward , faster and faster until with a sudden twist it shot into the mouth of the cavern . It came out in splinters . We watched them float away on the foaming water . Ed looked up at me and smiled for the first time that day . " Them rocks in there is jagged , " he said . He was trying the buckles of my harness and motioned to me to step off onto the bank . Then he was back at his place , pole in hand . Harry withdrew the hook . We were off . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apparently a very bullock of a man , ready to exert his strength to the uttermost . In reality I was quaking with fear and I had surreptitiously got out my pocket knife . I had decided I would not go into that cavern no matter what happened . If I saw I could n't hold the boat I would cut the line . I was feeling comforted a little by this decision as men are corn/forted by any plan in times of desperation when a voice spoke in front of me : " Put that knife up . " I had not even seen Ed look around but I put the knife back in my pocket and none too soon . The boat was going no faster than it had been going a moment before but it was caught now in a swirl of water and there was a steady persistentswerve to the right . I set my head and shoulders against the harness and pulled with all my might . There was a moment when the boat 's end just grazed the side of the cavern 's maw and we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foam ; then the boat veered , and shot forward into calm water . I wiped the sweat off my brow . Ed tied up until I was even with the boat and helped me out of the harness . As he lifted the strap off my head he smiled grimly : " I thought once I was going to have to put the hook into you , " he said . Half an hour later we tied up for the night . Harry took his gun and went off into the woods . He came back with three squirrels . Ed broiled them on a bed of hickory coals . We fished all the next day with an interval at noon when Harry again killed enough game for our dinner and our supper . At four o'clock the second day we left the boat at Malvern . We had to go back to Arab to get the train , a drive of forty miles through the mountains . We were on the train and were pulling out when I looked over and saw the old farmer still digging post-holes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brandished my fist : " I 'm sixty years old , " I called , " and I ai n't never dug a post-hole in my life . " That was on a Saturday in November when we had been living at Poplar Bluff seven years . The following Mondayp216I went down to the river immediately after lunch and having the luck to catch the sand-barge making an extra trip managed to get ten or fifteen miles upstream . I had a very good afternoon 's sport and found that I had timed myself well too . It was just growing dusk as I pulled my boat up on the sand bar and started up the hill to the house . I cleaned my fish at the back door and put them in a pan in the ice box ready to fry for supper , then went around to the front . Molly was not on the porch overlooking the river where she was usually to be found at this time of the day . I could never be easy coming in unless I exchanged a greeting with her or at least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so now I halloed in the hall according to my usual custom . " Mother , where are you ? " There was no answer for a minute and I thought that she must have gone out though it was unusual for her to do so at this hour of the day . Then I heard her calling to me from her bedroom . I went in and found her sitting quietly in a rocking-chair by the window . Something in her attitude and her extraordinary stillness frightened me . I asked her quickly if there were anything the matter . She smiled and said no , that she was a little tired and had come near going to sleep sitting there beside the window . I said no more about my fright or the feeling that had come over me when I saw her sitting there so still but I know now that I was not reassured by her words . Four weeks later it did not come to me as a surprise when she told me the doctor had said she must have a serious operation performed ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . In the next week it was as if time had stopped . I went here and there , did the errands I was bade , wrote the lettersp217that had to be written but none of the acts that I performed seemed to belong in its ordinary sequence of days and nights . The feeling of timelessness was upon me that blowy day in February as I paced the station platform waiting to meet Sally and Mrs. Fayerlee . They had been summoned by telegramand had met in St. Louis to come to Poplar Bluff on the same train . The wind was sharp . It occurred to me that I did not have my overcoat . I had not had time to get it . I had taken Molly to the hospital before coming to the train . She had had a sudden turn for the worse that afternoon and against her protests I had called up the doctor and asked hint what I should do ... . There had been a pause before his voice came over the wire . " You had better bring her to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been planned , or even this evening . . . But now . . . Now , I said to myself and tried to think what this present that I was living through was ... . The doctor had been busy when I arrived at the hospital and though I waited ten minutes I could get no word with him . But that young girl in the blue uniform wearing the white coif , had smiled serenely as she received Molly into the room that had been so suddenly filled with flowers . . . " And so you decided to come today instead of tomorrow , Mrs. Maury ? " And she had smiled again as she made her sit down in the wicker rocking-chair and wrapped her in the dressing gown that had been Sally 's last Christmas present .... The train was in . I descried Sally among the crowds surrounding the steps and swept along in her wake the little shrunken figure in black coat and old-fashioned bonnet . Sally was in my arms . " Dad . . . Dad , I thought I 'd never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to mine . She was smil- ing tremulously . " I thought Sally and I 'd never find each other in that big station , but we did . " Sally , walking on my other side , squeezed my arm suddenly . " How 's Mother ? " she asked in a low voice . " All right , " I said . " She 's gone to the hospital now so as to get a good rest and be ready for tomorrow . " We had arrived at the car which Harry had lent us for the occasion . I helped them in and spread the robe over Mrs. Fayerlee , noticing how small she was , how shrunken . She was leaning toward me . The hand on my knee trembled . " I got here as soon as I could , Aleck ... " " I know it , " I said , " I knew you 'd come . " She turned her face away as if exhausted by the effort to speak and sat looking out of the window . I remembered that Molly had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on my arm : " Dad , the man 's waiting for you to tell him where to go . " I turned to Harry 's chauffeur . " Drive us to the hospital ... and , Bill , get there as quick as you can . " People were coming and going in the halls . There was nobody in the upstairs waiting-room into which we were shown but an elderly gray-haired gentleman who sat beside a table persistently turning over the pages of a magazine . Mrs. Fayerlee sat down on a sofa just inside the room . I took my place beside her . Sally walked up and down or went to the window to look out until her grandmother called to her and asked if she were not tired , when she drew a chair up near the sofa . Mrs. Fayerlee sat erect , her slender , blue-veined hands clasped in her lap . Occasionally she turned to me and spoke in a low voice about the family at Merry Point or friends in Gloversville . It was seven o'clock before the door opened and a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the doorway.  |p219Her  eyes went from one to the other of us as if she did not know whom to address . The gray-haired man had shut his magazine with a little snap and was half rising from his seat when she spoke : " Professor Maury ... " I got up and went towards her . " Yes , " I said , " yes , I 'm Professor Maury . " The woman 's hand went to her white , well-kept throat . " There 's been an emergency operation , " she said . " We tried to get you . . . at the house . . . and at the college , too ... " I stood there staring stupidly . " Yes ? " I said . " Yes . . . ? " And then I heard Sally 's loud weeping behind me and I knew that Molly was dead . Molly was buried in the old Fayerlee burying-ground on the fifteenth of February . After the funeral , Sally and I drove as far as Gloversville together . We parted there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to await a westbound train two hours later . She had wanted to come back with me to Poplar Bluff , but I persuaded her not to . I did not want anybody with me then . I got into Poplar Bluff Monday morning in time for my eight o'clock class . The lesson was from cEdipus Tyrannus , the final magnificent chorus : The Robbins girl said eliYnTOV for ev77Tdv and I corrected her as I had done a hundred times before . The Greek class filed out and the Senior Latin came in . It was twelve o'clock . Gore , the biology professor , emerged from his lecture room in Science Hall as I came out of the main building . I stood there and talked with him a few minutes , touched by a new friendliness that shone that morning through the man 's awkwardmanner . It was months later that I realized that he had lost his wife the fall before . Susy had the house warm and dinner on the table when I got home . After dinner Flora and some ladies came with Sloane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat down in the empty house with some papers that I had to correct . I worked on them half an hour then went over and sat at the window . It was from here that you got the most unobstructed view of the river . I looked down upon it now through the bare branches and thought I had never seen it so satiny smooth , or so gray . The fifteenth of June 19- , I was sitting on the porch of the cottage reading a letter from Sally . Through the influenceof one of our old friends she had at last got the job she had coveted in a newspaper office and had started to work two days before . She liked the work , and the apartment she had taken with two other girls was very comfortable . I was not to worry about her . Everything was going all right . Then followed some pages of direction for Susy . The recipe for the custard pie that I liked so much was in the white cook book , not the brown one ; Susy must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I worry so about your being alone there in the house . And then I think that you will not be in the house much now . You will be on the river . I hope you go every day . . . " I put the letter aside and looked down at the still pool below . I had come up the path from the river only a half hour ago . I had made myself go down . I had tried it now three times in the last week . . . . But it was no good . I could gop221down and go through the motions but it was n't the same . ... I wondered whether it was grief that had dulled my faculties . . . . It was two years now . I ought to be getting over it , as much as people ever get over such things . Skip Fletcher , the boy who ran errands for the members of the faculty was riding up on his bicycle . He came to a stop at my gate . " President said he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maury , " he called and wheeled away . I got up , put on my coat and hat and started over the campus . The noonday glare was white-hot on the concrete walk ; I was glad when I could turn into the cool halls of the main building . Harry Morrow 's office door was open . He looked up quickly as I came in . " Well , Professor , how 's the fishing ? " I replied that they were striking but it did n't do me much good . " That pull down the hill and back gets harder every time I make it , Harry . " I added as I had done a hundred times before in conversation with him : " Better be thankful you 're not a big man , Harry . Your legs give down as you get older . " He nodded sympathetically . " They 're giving out on me now . I went out with the boys for an hour the other day and I was dog-tired when I got back . I do n't see how you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a letter that lay on the desk before him and was looking at it . He tossed it over to me finally : " I thought you 'd better see that . " It was a letter from the president of a Seminary in the northern end of the state . They wanted a man to teach Latin and two years of Greek . Could President Morrow make any recommendations ? I held the letter creased between my fingers . " I do n't know of anybody , " I said , " do you ? " Harry was looking down at his elaborate bronze inkwell.  |p222His  handsome , spectacled face was suddenly tinged with red . " Professor , " he said slowly , " have you ever thought of retiring ? " " No , " I said , " I have n't . " There was a long pause . Miss Stewart came back and forth noiselessly several times from the inner office . Harry had turned his chair so that it faced towards the campus . He seemed to be studying the trunk of the oak tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned around . I caught his eye squarely . " Harry , " I said , " I 've known you a long time . . . . Supposeyou lay the cards on the table . " He had got up and was walking about the room , winding his watch chain over and over his forefinger , a habit he had when he was excited . " The truth is , Selby 's got a new bee in his bonnet . You know how they 're pushing the classics out everywhere . . . all this sociology and economics that they like to study these days . Well , Selby wants to take a stand against it . Make Rodman a place where the Humanities still hold their own ... " I smiled . " I do n't believe even Selby is going to be able to do much for the Humanities . . . . After all very few students nowadays want to learn Latin and Greek . . . " Harry smiled too . " Well , if Selby is willing to put up the money . .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new department . . . . Well , you 'll need an up and coming man ... " I got up , walked over to the table and picked up a pen . I had no idea how a letter of resignation should be couched ; I had to deliberate for a moment before I wrote : " ... permission of the faculty and trustees of Rodman College to be relieved of the incumbency of the chair of Latin and Greek , said remission of duties to begin on this day , June 15 , 19 -- - . Resp'y , Alex . Maury. "  |p223Harry  had come up and was standing beside me . " Professor , I ca n't tell you how I appreciate your taking it like this . . . . There 's not another man in the world . . . no more than I expected . . . " His voice was the voice of my boyish assistant in Mississippi years ago . I listened absently . It had occurred to me as I dipped pen in ink that here for the first time in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on . I could go anywhere I wanted to , do what I pleased ... . Harry had not taken the paper up . I lifted it and slid it forward into place beside the bronze inkwell . " Well , " I said , " I 'd better be going . " He walked with me to the door . We stood there a few minutes while I told him the news about Sally . The door had closed behind him . I started down the corridor . I was free . I could do anything I wanted to do . Only , I thought with sudden panic , there was n't anything now that I wanted to do .... I went back to the cottage . There were some callers waiting for me : Doctor Lacy and his wife . I talked with them until five o'clock and then went in and lay down on the bed until Susy came and prepared my supper . When I had finishedeating I went out on the porch and lit my pipe . It was still light when I went out . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five hours I engaged , I imagine , in more introspection than in all of the rest of my life put together . I knew suddenly what it was I had lived by , from the time when , a mere child , I used to go out into the woods at night hunting with a negro man . I remembered  --  it must have been when I was about eight  --  looking up in black woods into the deep , glowing eyes of the quarry and experiencinga peculiar , an almost transfiguring excitement . I had experienced it for the first time that night long ago in the4 ,  |p224woods  at Oakleigh and I had been seeking and finding it , with mounting excitement , ever since . I had known from the first that it was all luck ; I had gone about seeking it , with , as it were , the averted eyes of a savage praying to his god . But I had brought all my resources to bear on the chase . I had used skill and caution  --  nobody but myself knew what patience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sport  --  and I had succeeded as few men , I told myselfnow with some arrogance , had ever succeeded . . . . These last few weeks out on that blue river when I had found myselfover and over wondering dully why I was there , why I should be doing this particular thing had been the first time in all my life it had ever failed me . Some words of my old father 's stirred in my mind . " Minervainvita erat , " he used to say when his poem or his pleasuresfor the day had gone wrong , and I can remember even as a child the feeling of hopelessness , of desperation that used to come over me as I heard the melancholy words fallingfrom his lips . . . Delight . . . I had lived by it for sixty years and now it was gone and might never come again . . . . I had been a solemn , not very lively child and as a man I had been beset at intervals all my life by some vague apparentlyunfounded fear . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst , had laughed at this trait in my nature . " You 're the greatest coward I 've ever known ... " I knew now what it was I had always feared : that this elation , this delight by which I lived might go from me . .. . Well , it had gone and it might never come again . . . . It was not a thing to he trapped , delight , it came or went of its own will . . . . The clear-headedness was gone . I felt old and tired . I knocked the ashes of my cold pipe out on the railing , got up and went into the house . As I undressed I told my-.  |p225self  dully that I had after all been lucky . The average man wears out his life in uncongenial employments whereas up to now I had done very little that I did n't want to do and that only for a small portion of my time . Yes , I had been lucky . It might be that I had all my luck at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this for years and years . ' My old father had turned ninety when he died . I might live fully as long . . . . I looked around the silent room whose furniture , even , in the last few weeks had taken on an alien air , and told myself desperately that I could not face that . I could take , I had taken my share of Fortune 's blows , but there were some things I could not face . .. . I approached the window . The river was visible from here as from all the north windows of the house . Farther downstreamthe lights of the town picked out bright reflections in the water but up here only the solitary light from Old George 's cabin clove the blackness . But I could hear the water flowing as I had heard it every night now for five years . I stood there listening , then I turned out the light and got in bed and after a while went to sleep . When I woke in the morning  --  and I believe this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had a plan . It was not much but it was something to hang onto and in my new , humble frame of mind I was genuinely grateful for it . I would go somewhere  --  I did n't know just where yet  --  and live quietly and engage in the breeding of fish . There were all sorts of problems that had been in the back of my head for years . I would work them out patiently one by one . I would set myself definite problems : the channel cat , for instance , they said it would not breed in stagnant water . I had once had a long correspondence with an old Germanxa professor at a state university who had devoted the better part of a lifetime to the breeding of fish and he was sure they would n't ; but I had a fancy they would . Once while fishing Hatcher 's pond I had been annoyed at stumbling over an old piece of iron from a threshing machine and had thrown it into the pond to get it out of the way . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that pond stocked with channelcat . I had recalled throwing the piece of iron in and had had the curiosity to wade out and find that they had scooped out a place under it and were using it as a breeding ground . It had occurred to me then that the channel cat does not spawn until very late in the season , when the water in sun or shade , is of the right temperature to hatch the eggs . I had thought it possible then that they might breed freely in any water where they could find shelter to spawn , but I had never verified the discovery  --  if it was a discovery  --  by other experiments . Now as I sat drinking my coffee my mind played about the edges of this new idea . I knew by the way I felt about it that it was going to mean something . And in a case like that one must be wary . It does n't do to try to take hold of such an idea too quickly . One must wait and , slowly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this in itself transfigured the day for me  --  the old , desperate desire for time , more time . I would have liked to sit down now with my pipe and mull over my plan , but I had not time for more than a few minutes of cautious thinking about it . Sally was arriving at eight-thirty and I had to go to the station to meet her . I was late . She had already got off the train when I arrived at the station . She had travelled all night and was looking , I thought , a little worn , but I felt the familiar rush of pleasure at beholding her . Sally is not conventionally pretty but her looks have always been very pleasing to me  --  it may be because she is dark and has Maury features . Shep227hooked her arm through mine and we started up the street , Sally talking excitedly . She could only stay two days . Her boss had given her six but it took the best part of four days getting here and back . How was I getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she any account at all ? Back at the house , curled up on the old sofa , she continued her rapid interrogation . What were my plans for the future ? She had been thinking it over and had decided that I ought not to stay on alone in this house . A small apartment or perhaps even a nice boarding house . I liked to sit around in the evenings and talk to people ... . I was a little appalled at the ease with which she made plans for me . I informed her that I was not going to stay in this house because I was not going to teach at Rodman any more . She stared at this and then began to hint delicately that I was making a mistake in giving up my work . She realized , of course , that sport was my real interest in life , but I needed something , some framework of life to give an edge to it . I might find myself going stale if I had nothing to do but fish . I explained that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had had with Ilarry . She grew volubly indignant : " The sneak . The dirty , two-timing sneak . . . " ... Sally 's conversation , ever since she went out into the world to make her living , has always struck me as odd . She , and few of her friends , I imagine , follow any sport , and yet their conversation is pervaded with a raciness that I have always associated with the turf or the prize ring . And they use metaphors which are to say the least astounding . I shall never forget my astonishment when I heard for the first time an expression derived directly from the stud ' falling in the midst of polite company from the lips of a gently bred young woman . The phrase that so astonished Maury was : " She ca n't take it . "  | Indignation , righteous or otherwise , soon wears itself out . Sally , after a good round denunciation of Harry  --  she had never liked him and Mother had detested him from the first  --  went back to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she described her daily routine at the newspaper office where she worked . The managing editor was all right but the city editor , like Harry , was lousy . He would not give her the assignments she wanted but kept her on footling woman 's page stuff . I listened and sympathized as best I could but I could not really understand why she was so annoyed at not having been allowed to go to a house where two men 's dead bodies had been found riddled by bullets . My mind even while she was talking reverted graduallyto my own affairs . I thought of a hybrid I had seen once , rock bass on pond perch , a beautiful fish , yellow as gold with ten thousand minuteblack specks seemingly under the skin . . . . I had always wanted an opportunity to experiment with the crossing of fish . . . . Then there was the bream . Sir Izaak Walton , and I have usually found him right , says never stock an enclosedarea with bream . But I had a fancy that it could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my pipe and walked out on the porch . The still , blue pool lay before me , shining in the late afternoon sun . As always I was reminded of some other body of water that I had known and fished in years gone by . I walked to the end of the porch and looked down through the hickories and elms . Suddenly , it came to me , the resemblance that had eluded me for years . It looked like Jim Buford 's lake at Cadiz where I used to fish years ago when I lived in Gloversville . I knew now what I was going to do . I would lease that lake and carry on my experiments there . MORE DEAD WATERp231LEFT Poplar Bluff three days later . I had wired JimI Buford that I wanted to board at his house and lease his three lakes . His answer came the day before I left . A letter  --  Jim would have thought it madness to telegraph : " Dear Professor : There 's not any fish in these lakes to speak of . If there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you a boat fixed now and Lucy has thirty-five early friers waiting for you . When are you coming ... ? " I knew another telegram would distress Jim , but I felt that I had no time to lose , so I wired again : I would arrive at Cadiz at six fifty-five Friday eve . I would be glad if he could meet me . He met me at the depot in his model-T . It had been the old red mare , Dolly , when I used to come out and fish in his lake years ago . Dolly had been , even in old age , skittish , inclined to shy at every scrap of paper blown along the road , , but the model-T , Jim confided , was even harder to manage . He had thought that he would never learn to drive , but he had managed after three years to get the hang of it so that he was able to get about in the car . " But it ai n't like having a horse , " he said . " No independence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction proceeded along the highway . It was a new road , one I had not seen before for I had not been in this country for fifteen years . Cadiz , Jim said , was picking up . There had been many improvements . I duly admired the new houses , the filling-stations , the barbecue stands which he pointed out , but I was glad when he turned off the highway into the red tobacco road . Here things were not much changed . Goldenrod and ironweedstill grew in the fence corners , the same old rail-fence still encircled Jim 's thirty-acre field . It was in tobacco this year , and it had been in tobacco the summer I used to come out there from Gloversville and it gave me a pleasant feeling of familiarity as we rattled on over the wooden bridge and up to the house . Mrs. Buford was at the gate to meet us , her hands folding and refolding themselves under her apron , a habit of hers when she was a prey to strong excitement . Her first words concerned the friers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off soon as I got your telegram . They been on ice two days now . " I recalled that it was I who had apprised this worthy woman of the fact that chickens , game , any fowl , or any flesh is not edible on the first day it has been killed and I reflected as I stepped cautiously down out of the Ford that I had probably never performed a greater service for any of my pupils in all my years of teaching . We went into the house ; Mrs. Buford showed me my room , a square airy chamber on the first floor ; I had asked to be on the ground for the climbing of steps was already wearisome to me . There were two closets in it I saw to my satisfaction and , stroke of luck , a small porch opening on the back yard . One closet would accommodate my scanty wardrobeand I would have the whole of the other for my rods , and my equally valuable minnow buckets and traps , when not in use . And I could dry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my hands and got ready for supper my mind , dormant it seemed to me so long , was already working on some of the problems that would confront me . A feeding pen , the idea for which had been growing in my mind for years , suddenly took shape . Four panes of glass , eighteen byp233twelve in a frame like a truncated pyramid , with an opening at the top just large enough to set a lantern in ... . It would not be at all difficult to make but I would need certain tools . I might go into town tomorrow with Jim and buy the lumber and the window glass . I might as well buy a saw and a plane , too . There would be carpentering to do off and on ... The supper bell  --  the Bufords still kept to the good old ways  --  reverberated through the house . I remembered that Mrs. Buford was an excellent cook . Well , I would try to be as little trouble to her as possible so that she would want me to stay a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carefully on its rack and went out on the latticed back porch that in summer was the family dining-room . The friers , the first of the season , were golden brown . There were new butter beans , and tender young squash and new potatoes and for dessert rhubarb pie topped with whipped cream . It was one of those meals that stand out in the memory . We must have been at the table an hour before Jim and I rose on one long sigh of mutual assent and made our way out to the back porch . Dusk had fallen during supper and yet a little of that glimmering evening light which in my mind is so intimately associated with that countryside still lingered on the green sward that sloped down to the lakes . Jim , settled back in his cane-bottomed rocker , lit his pipe and embarked on his favorite story , of how as a boy he and another fellow had discovered that the channel cat feeds only at night and seeks its food upon the surface of the water . Jim and the fellow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hank of Half Pone Creek  --  had tied a dozen lines onto the limbs of a sycamore that hung over the water . The next morning when they went down every limb , near about , had a cat on it.  | There was a climax to the story . " I went back next summer and I says , Aaron , how 's your crop ? ' Hell , ' he says , since I found out about them limb lines I ai n't got no crop . ' " The story  --  it was Jim 's only sporting anecdote out of a life of hard labor  --  was told in deference to me . I had heard it a thousand times but it always rang pleasantly upon my ear . Mrs. Buford having finished washing the dishes came out and taking her place in the swing brought me up-to-date on neighborhood news . I listened , smoking . Once as she paused for a while I found myself remembering that I had not even asked the Bufords whether they would board me . No matter , I thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and yet if they were n't there was no need to worry . The matter would be arranged . I felt that everything would arrange itself . I got up in the morning still with that easy feeling of not having to concern myself about anything , and of merely waiting for a program to carry itself out . I knew what I should be doing for the next few months and I knew , too , what tools I would use . The best thing was to buy them now and have them on hand . It being Saturday , Jim was going to town anyhow ; so towards eight o'clock I got in the Ford with him and we rattled back to Cadiz . My old friend , Pop Warner , was still behind the counter of " General Merchandise and Accessories . " I had never known just what it was he kept accessories for but there he was and I found him as of old able to furnish most of the things I needed : a small fine saw , a plane , an adze , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tenpenny  --  there is nothing that gives a man a better feeling than an adequate collection of nails  --  a can of shellac , ap235dozen window panes , and finally  --  and for this I had to go across the way to the contractor 's  --  some fine light strips of poplar . Jim , when he saw the lot , asked me jocularly if I was n't intending to build a house and indeed the Model-T did presentan appearance queerer than ordinary as we loaded the stuff in and started home . I found I was fatigued by the morning 's effort and against my custom I took a nap after dinner . Towards four o'clock when the light was just beginning to get lower I strolled down over the hill , seine in hand , to look at the lakes . The path led through the stable lot and down through a little locust grove . On its edge was a negro cabin , its tiny front yard gay with flowers and enclosed with a whitewashedpaling fence . ( Jim Buford was a good farmer and kept all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , middle-agedwoman who was wash-boiling clothes on an outdoor fire under a huge sugar tree looked up , showing white teeth in a flashing smile as I passed . I remembered that just such a strong-looking negro woman had come down to the edge of the lake when I had cooked fish on the bank once after an extra good catch . The best fish cook in the country Jim had called her , and I , who am hard to please when it comes to frying fish , bad agreed . " Darthula , " I said passing . " Now ai n't this Darthula ? " She shook her head still smiling . " It 's Robbie , Darthula 's sister . " " Well , you shore favor Darthula . I bet you 're as good a fish cook , too . " " Yas sir , Mama done learned all her girls to cook feesh . " Three or four children who had been playing with a broken-down baby carriage came up and stood in a silent row . I looked them over gravely . " Darthula @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be wanting a boy to carry my stuff and help me around the lake . Which one of these chillun is the smartest ? " There were four ranging from twelve or thirteen down to one naked urchin who could n't have been two . As I stopped speaking , the oldest , a woolly-headed lad with his mother 's flashing senile , stepped forth as it were from the ranks . " I 'm the onliest one that 's big enough , " he announced sedately . Darthula  --  or Robbie  --  wiping her hands on her apron had come up to the fence . " Yas sir . Will Dudley knows how to stay round white folks . " I had not thought that in these days it took much acumen to stay round white folks . I studied the boy 's features . " He looks smart . What 's his name ? " " Will Dudley , " his mother said proudly , " Will Dudley Wisdom . " I was tickled at the idea of the diminutive urchin responding to such an appellation . " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " because that means smart . Come on , Wisdom . " And followed by my small Man Friday I went on down the path to the lakes . They lay in a green basin , a natural amphitheatre a hundred yards below the house . The larger lake , I thought , would be the scene of most of my operations . It was a fine body of water , about four acres , amazingly clear for a pond , and fringed with willows . At the north bank a small neck of water made connection with the smaller pond . I stood on the bank and surveyed the scene . Tenor was it fifteen years ago  --  when I used to come out here from Gloversville the four-acre lake had been well stocked with bass and crappie . You could have come down here any evening towards six o'clock and taken a two- or three-pound bass , and the crappie had been almost as good . I knew , however , that I would not find it that way now . They were sure to have run out , forp237the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own young . I took off my shoes , rolled up my khaki pants , and then took up the thirty-f oot seine that I had brought with me . " Come on , Wisdom , " I said . The small boy took one end and I the other , and we waded into the water . We waded straight towards the middle of the lake  --  it was not more than four feet at its deepest , but Wisdomwas up to his neck most of the time . Once he stepped into a hole and I had to reach out and grab him by the scruff of the neck . We made a good haul , thirty or forty bass and crappie with crappie predominating . They were good fish , many of them large enough to weigh a pound but I suppose none of them actually weighed more than six ounces , and some were curiously misshapen with tremendous heads and tiny bodies covered with pallid scales . I took out my knife and slit two or three open . There was nothing in the stomachs , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been lacking so long that in some the organs of digestion had become atrophied . Sitting on the bank , smoking , I reflected with a little anger that in almost every enclosed body of water all over the country the same thing was going on . A benevolent governmentwould furnish any farmer , who wanted to stock his pond , with bass that would at first wax and flourish , then turn cannibal and finally come to the miserable degeneracy of these fish in Jim Buford 's lake . The great state of Kansas , I recalled , has a form of reply to every one who writes asking for bass to stock with . It says in effect : This is a free country and it 's your pond . We ca n't keep you from putting bass into it but we wo n't be a party to your making a fool of yourself .... Well , I was not a missionaryand it was none of my business . Perhaps other states , even the Federal government , might in time become as en- lightened as the Kansas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before me . I rather thought as I glanced at the solemn face of my small companion and then looked over the lake , its water swelling with the evening breeze , that I was going to enjoy working it out . After breakfast the next morning I went , taking my seine , to a small pond in the stable lot . It was , as I had expected , full of pond perch  --  the shikepoke and herons perform this office , carrying half-digested spawn which will live and in time tremendously overstock any pond . These pond perch as they were now were too small for my purposes ; two of them could have lain on a nickel . I sat down under the shade of a tree and mopped my sweating face and considered . While I was sitting there Jim came along and asked me in country phrase what I thought I was doing . He laughed heartily when I said I was trying to figure out some way to feed the perch in this little pond . I sat there for an hour . By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisdom and I built the feedingpen . The design was very simple . Two pieces of woven wire , the seine 's distance apart , were run out from the bank in the shape of a V. They went out in the pond fifteen or twenty feet and the opening between them was about twenty feet . I had the pen finished by four o'clock and I began feeding those fish that afternoon . I fed them heavily for two weeks , on cracked corn ; then one morning about ten days before spawning time I went in with a forty-foot seine . Wisdom had rounded me up five more negro boys ; they were waiting on the back porch when I finished breakfast . I had to ask Mrs. Buford for four ten-gallon cans , a request calculated to upset any housekeeper but she ransacked pantry and smokehouse and assembled myp239requirements . The boys carried the cans down the hill . I followed , my forty-foot seine on my back . The boys halloed and laughed and we waded out into the water . The first haul was tremendous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drag , a roll as big as your arm f rom one staff to the other . The little negroes pulled manfully but they could not drag the seine to the bank . But I had prepared small dip nets and we dipped the pond perch out and put them into the tengalloncans without water  --  as many as the boys could carry . They rushed over the rise and poured the perch into the lake . We kept this up all afternoon and for ten afternoons more until we could get only a fourth of the original number at a drag . Having finished pouring the little perch into the big lake , I turned to the smaller one where I had already decided that my experiments would be with bream . The bream , in spite of Izaak Walton , is the great pond fish . He is a fierce biter and the gamest fish of his size that swims . A pound bream will fight you as fiercely as a pound bass any day . He is the most prolific of all fish , spawning in Kentucky three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pond almost before you know what has happened . Yet I had thought out a plan by which I hoped I could handle the surplus bream . I would make a feeding pen similar to the one I had used for the pond perch , and train the fish to come there and eat every day . When they came into the pen it would be easy to take out the surplus . Mrs. Buford laughed when I explained the procedure . I must think fish were like chickens , to come at a call . I said wait and see . I constructed the pen of woven wire in V-formation under the boughs of a low-hanging willow . For weeks I went down there twice a clay , morning and evening , and scattered cracked corn in the pen . At first only a few fish came , thenP day by day more , until finally when I began scattering corn there would be a shimmering rush and dozens of good-sized bream would fight their way into the pen . I tried throwing ; the corn from the boat , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chickens in a poultry yard will follow a woman trailing corn . After feeding them on corn for about three weeks I decided to vary their diet . I had a scheme for a trap to take insects and I now tried it . A post was driven fast into the lake , almost level with the water . Four panes of glass , eighteenby twelve , were set in a wooden frame truncated like a pyramid . A lantern , the biggest Pop Warner had in his store , I set inside the pyramid . The evening I installed the insect trap we all went down to the lake to see it work . It was not quite dusk when I waded out and lit the lantern . Its flame in the clear light was hardly visible ; Mrs. Buford said it looked lonesome out there all by itself . We waited another half hour . It grew dark ; the lantern flame glowing steadily was reflected in a long shimmering shaft over the water . I walked down to the bank . A June Bug zooning low over the lake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back into the water  --  exactly as I had planned . Another came in a few seconds , then another . In a quarter of an hour the lantern 's flame was obscured by the cloud of insects hoving round it and we could hear the steady plop-plop as they fell into the water and could see the bream leaping to take them . As we walked back up the hill Jim asked with a laugh if I were not afraid the bream would deteriorate through getting lazy , having their food handed out , as it were , on a silver platter . I replied that that was a problem I had n't tackled yet but no doubt I could solve it in time . I was beginning to feel not a little pride in my inventions . I had always been handy with tools and I enjoyed makingp241all these things . There were many problems to be worked out , too . The bream , fed on bugs , grew too oily . In the late summer I had to put them back on cracked corn . Then there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain seasons of the year kept me and Wisdom busy all clay for a week or two . I used to be out on the water the better part of every day . Drifting about on the lake I thought sometimes of absent companions ... Rafe Hill who used to take me out into the woods hunting when I was a little boy ... Mr. Jones . . . Cecil Morrison ... an old negro named Jake Ilooser who lived on the banks of Spring Creek ; it was he who had first showed me that all game fish are ground nesters .. .. I seemed in my long life to have known many men who were proficients in their line . I wondered what had become of them all . They were probably all dead now . Rafe Hill must be by this time , and Mr. Jones and Jake Hooser .... Even John Garland , only five years my senior , had succumbed ten years ago to pneumonia . .. . I think it was there drifting about on the still waters of Lake Lydia that for the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of my own death . Molly , who had a melancholy streak in her nature , used even in her youth to speak of death and say where she wanted to be buried . And she had liked to recite some lines from Swinburne : " Here where the world is quiet , Here where all trouble seems Dead winds ' and spent waves ' riot In doubtful dream of dreams ... " I had never liked the poem or any other celebrating death , had always said that I would not be cheated of even the last breath . But now it did not so much seem to matter.  | Two years went by , broken only by a bout of rheumatic fever in the winter . I had come by this time to feel myself a member of the Buford family . The chicken livers were alwaysput at my plate in a special little tureen . My own specialchair  --  sat in a certain place by the fireside in winter . In the summer it was moved out under the great sugar tree . I used to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was too hot to go out on the lake , and read , or write the brief letter which duty compelled me once a week to send my daughter . Sally was married to her scholar and they had gone abroad . They were in Paris now and Sally wrote long letters descriptiveof places which I supposed she thought would interest me . Their little hotel was right around the corner from the rue Ferou . And only the other day she had walked past the house on Vaugirard , where Aramis used to live , and had dined at the very hostelry where D'Artagnan and the other guardsmen used to leap off their horses and go in and order a bottle and bird . In the summer they were going to Brittany to a place in the mountains . There were trout streams there . She wished I would come over and join them . Sitting there under the tree I used to read Sally 's letters and try sometimes to picture the places of which she wrote . But they remained remote and shadowy ; my world was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the backgroundand in the foreground the lake shimmering in the bright noonday sun . It seemed to me that it might be that way for the rest of my life . . . . There was a young fellow named Tom Woodall who used to come and sit on the bank watching my work or sometimes lending a hand . One evening he said he was going over top243the locks and dam on the Cumberland River the next day and asked me if I would not go along . I had no desire to accompany him  --  the Cumberland is not the kind of water that has ever interested me  --  but I was feeling dull being so much alone , and thought perhaps a change of scene might do me good . So I assented and it was agreed that we should start early next morning . It is strange the tyranny habit can have over a man . For a year and a half I had been going to bed at nine o'clock , sometimeseven eight , and falling to sleep the minute my head hit the pillow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expeditionthat had once formed so large a part of my life had set off some old train of association . I went to bed that night at nine as usual , but I did not go to sleep . I lay awake for an hour planning the day 's campaign just as I used to do in the old days . I had not seen the Cumberland for more than fifteen years ; it was the one body of water that in the old days bored me . Still , if I were going to make a day of it I might as well make it as good as possible . Tom swore there were bass in the river , and crappie , too . I did not believe there were , or if they were there that they would be taken with a fly . Mrs. Buford had promised an early breakfast and she was as good as her word . I had finished eating and was out on the little porch getting my tackle ready when Tom , whistlingsoftly , came up the path . He had promised to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Silversides , so the first thing I asked him was what luck he had had . He shook his head . " I could n't get none . Ai n't no minnowsin that creek or Mr. Heflin 's pond , either . " " What 's the use going then ? " I asked . Tom , naturally , a good-humored fellow , remained unpreturbed . " Craws , " he said , " we 'll go to the creek and get craws. "  | I was mollified . I was in , doubtless , for a day of bait fishing . Well , there 's no better all-round bait in the world than craws . I knew , too , that it was full of the moon . The crawfish changes his shell every time the moon is full . We would get plenty of soft craws then if we got any at all . I got out my little hand seine , then at the last minute I picked up my light rod and put a No. 3 Pfleuger Tandem Spinner in my tackle box . I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapid water at the foot of a dam . I might cast a little if bait-fishing got too tiresome . We got into Tom 's Ford and rode along the dewy lane to the big road . Canton was another ten miles further . I had heard of it many times  --  a resort for fishermen , on the locks and dam  --  but I had not been there before . The village consistedof two general stores and a cluster of houses . We stopped at a house and talked to one of Tom 's cronies , Bob Alston . His boat was tied up to that leaning sycamore about a quarter of a mile from the dam . We were welcome to use it . He did n't know what luck we would have ; the river was low but clear as glass . " They can see you a mile off . Besides , " he added wisely , " the moon ai n't right . " It always distresses me to see a man in possession of half information . I wanted to inform this young man that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a lure in the full of the moon , but Tom 's Ford was already roaring and we whirled away before I could get out a word . We rattled through Canton and took the road along the river . I found the road more populous than the village itself . A fisherman 's colony had sprung up , an old-time cabin of hewn squared logs here , a flimsy modern lodge next to it , and , raising their gaunt chimneys among the silver poplars that covered the whole slope , two or three dilapidated old mansions of by-gone days . One of these had been lately renovated ; new brick chimneys had been built at each end ofp245the house and the square columns that supported the porch glistened with new paint . Silver poplars grew all about the house and covered the sloping lawn . One , near the house , cast a deep shade on the porch and on the brick wall that zig-zagged by easy stages down the slope . Some effort had evidently been expended on the grounds too , for the grass even on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hedge higher than my head encircled the whole yard ; the only break in the long wall of green , the gateway where an iron arch , twined with vines , bore the words " River Lodge . " Tom jerked a thumb upward as we passed . " You know that old fellow lives up there ? " I shook my head . Tom laughed . " He sure is a cat , ninety years old and he do n't ever miss a day on the river . " Ninety years old . . . It seemed a great age , not as old as I once would have thought it but far beyond the Biblical three-score and ten which r suddenly realized was all I ever allowed myself . Well , a man who reached the age of ninety had achieved something : he was free from the fear of approachingold age . It was already here . One might return then , in a sense , to the timelessness of childhood . Every day would be a gift from the gods and it would be a man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch ? " I asked curiously . " Channel cat . . . buffalo . . . he do n't care what it is so long 's he catches ' em . " We drove over what seemed to me a precipice , slid in loose gravel a few feet , and came to a stop , just missing the trunk of an enormous sycamore . " Well , " Tom said , " we are here . " I got out stiffly . " Yes , by the grace of God . " But Tom did n't hear me . He had already dashed off for the creek . He yelled out delightedly now that he had found it . I must come at once and bring the seine.  | I had hardly got my breath . If I had been out alone I would have sat down on the nearest log to smoke a pipe while I took my bearings . But after all it was Tom 's day . I had been fool enough to come out with a man thirty years my junior . I would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off , seine in hand through the thick underbrush . It was hot work and I was glad when I saw the water of the little creek glistening through the cane . Tom had rolled his trousers up and was knee-deep in the water . I followed suit and we started up the creek , seining . The water was cold . The shock as I stepped in was tremendous . It hit the top of my head first , then travelled down and settled in a tingling ache in my game leg . I reflected with irritation that I would probably lie awake half the night with cramp . But there was no help for it . Tom could n't handle the seine alone . I stumbled on , holding my end up as best I could . As we got nearer the spring the water got even colder . It had got both my legs by this time ; I felt as if I were completely paralyzed from the knee down and I began to wonder whether Tom would be able to drag me out of the creek if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deal for one man to handle , even as strong and athletic a fellow as Tom . I was about to tell him that I could n't stand it any longer when he waded over to the bank to look into the minnow bucket where we were depositing our haul . " Half-full , " he said . " That 's enough , ai n't it ? " I said that in my judgment it was plenty . We left the water and made our way back through the trail Tom had blazed through the cane to where Bob 's boat was tied up to a fallen sycamore . The boat was not much good , heavy and water-logged , but Tom bailed her out and we took our places , he in the bow , I in the stern . We drifted a little way down the river , then I saw a sunken tree top which looked to me like a good placep247and we tied up there , and I fished off the bow of the boat . I was using a steel rod and reel and Tom had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ good bait . Tom took a threepoundchannel cat in the first few minutes . I , on the other side of the boat , was not exerting myself but I had caught two cat and had strung them over the side when an exclamationfrom Tom made me turn round . He had risen to his knees and was staring at the dangling broken end of his line . " What was it ? " I asked . " Must have been a big one  --  walked off with that twenty pound test line . " I was interested in spite of myself . " Why n't you give him the spring of the pole ? " I asked . He shook his head and said that the big one had taken him by surprise . He 'd do it the next time . We fished for a half an hour without getting a strike . Suddenly Tom tied into a big one . He was ready for him this time and gave him the spring of the pole but he did n't keep his line taut enough . I found myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , hold it , do n't give him any slack ! " " I ai n't giving him slack , " Tom gasped , " he 's taking it . " He stood firm , however , and played his fish well . Once the cane pole bent until it described a narrow arc , I thought it must surely break but Tom held on , and after two minutesthe fish turned over on his back and showed his belly . " A ten-pounder all right , " Tom said , and I decided that he was as I hefted him over the side of the boat to string him with the others . Tom caught a few little ones , then announced that that water was fished out . We drifted down the river another hundred yards . He was about to make for the bank when I stopped him . " No , " I said , " let 's make for those willows . "  | We paddled across the river . It was a pool about fifteen feet deep . A little spit of land with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Logs drifting downstream had caught there and held , one after another , until the pool was enclose I on two sides . Bream water I thought if I had ever seen bream water . I took two bream in the first fifteen minutes . A pound bream under twelve feet of water gives you a good fight . I should have been glad to stay there longer but Tom was impatient to go on . " Sometimes they bite below the dam , " he said . " Let 's go down there . " The river was low . The apron of the dam was bare clear across the river . It was a job for a light , agile man , and a great effort was needed for me to get down on the apron but I made it with much grunting and groaning on my part and a little hauling and pulling on Tom 's . He continued to fish with the soft craws but I took my cork and sinker off and put the guinea tail on . I walked down the apron dry shod and cast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the third cast a three-pound jack took my guinea tail . I caught a three-pound Little Mouth and then a smaller Big Mouth . It was the first time I had cast in over a year . I found my arm soon wearied . I was glad when Tom looked at his watch and said it was time to eat lunch . We ate our sandwiches and drank ice-cold tea in the shade of the big sycamore . After lunch Tom said he would go back to the dam and try the small currents again . I started back with him but I had not gone more than a hundred yards before a sharp pain set in in my game leg . I went on doggedlyfor a few minutes but the pain got worse . I stopped . " It 's no use , Tom , " I said , " I ca n't make it . " " Well , " he said , " you just set down here in the shade . I 'll he back in a little while . "  |p249The  shade was dense along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down and lit my pipe . As I sat smoking my eye fell on a contraption that somebody had rigged up just at the edge of the water , a queer box-like object fitted into the shelving bank . At first I thought it was some sort of fish trap but I could not see any place for the ingress of the fish . My curiosity finally got the better of me and I went over to investigate it . It was a broad shelf resting upon an upright plank , one end fitting into the bank , the other resting on anotherupright . The lower upright plank had had nine augur holes bored in it . I chuckled when I saw them . Somebody must like to take his fishing very easy . I went back and sat down under the shade of my sycamore . I had finished my pipe by this time and would have liked nothing better than to go to sleep , but reclining on hard ground is an uncomfortable exercise for a man of my dimensions ; I remained erect but somnolent under my tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shadows begin to lengthen . I had not noticed until this moment that I was exactly opposite River Lodge , the nonagenarian 's retreat . The house and the grounds were more clearly visible from here than they had been from the road . I studied them , idly speculating on the character of a man who would bury himself in this out-of-the-way spot . As I sat there gazing a woman came out to the hall and on to the porch . She walked to the far end , bent and seemed to be lifting some object , then turned and called to some one in the house . The person called to emerged a few minutes later . The nonagenarian himself , I thought with a little excitement , so empty was my mind at that moment of all other interest . A man , at any rate , and old , for his figure silhouettedagainst the black hall was meagre and bent . He stood a few minutes on the edge of the porch , apparentlytalking to the woman , who was collecting various ob- jects ; then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went first , carrying a minnow bucket and some other object that I could n't make out . The old man progressed much more slowly . I think he must have had regular stages on that cruel slope at which to stop , for he had a way of spurting a little for a few steps , then coming suddenly to rest on a flat rock or garden seat . The woman had reached the foot of the slope . I heard the lock click as she opened the gate and stepped out on the willow-fringed bank . She was visible only a moment in the gateway , then she disappeared among the willows . I fancied she was busy untying a boat . The old man had got up from his last station , a flat rock beside a crape-myrtle bush , and had begun again his slow descent . His figure was lost to me for a few minutes among the shrubs ; then he , too , emerged from the gateway , and stood for a moment as if preparing himself for one more effort before he moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not see my couple again for what seemed a long time . I had in fact decided that I had lost them , and had got up and gone down to the spring for a drink and had come back to my place under the sycamore tree when I caught sight of them , in a boat now and moving slowly but steadily toward my bank . I had no wish to intrude mself upon them or indeed to make any new acquaintances , so I decided that I would move a little farther back up the bank . But I had some little curiosityto inspect the faces of this couple who had engaged my undivided interest for over a quarter of an hour ; so I sat quietly where I was until the boat had come near enough for the faces of her passengers to be clearly seen . The womanseemed to be on what was now , alas , the far side of middle age , not very tall , I judged , and dark , with a hand/some coil of dark hair knotted high at the back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old gentleman sat still and looked about him composedly . I fancied he was savoring the cool air for he turned his head slowly from side to side and his eyes roved over the whole scene as if he found it pleasant . His hair was pure white . Once as he turned his head a bold Roman nose stood out in relief against the green of the far bank . The boat had now come to rest under the willows . They would be preparing to get out . I got up and retreated a little way up the bank . As I stood up the old man in the boat was just stepping out upon the bank . I had a moment 's very clear vision of his face : chalk gray and deeply lined under the snow-white hair . I saw , too , as he came nearer that he moved with an exaggerated deliberation , as if his very bones were brittle . I sauntered up the path and ensconced myself tinder a tree . The old man had taken his seat on the oddly constructedbench . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she handed each pole to him he stuck it in its place so that when she had finished he had nine poles within six inches of his hand . I could not , of course , tell exactly how they were rigged up but I judged that four or five were wrapped guides , tip and reel seat , and the rest outfitted simplywith lines , sinker and cork . The poles with reels would be at the far end , the cane poles between his legs or on either side of him . I chuckled to myself at the ingenuity of the arrangement . For a long time there was silence . Then the old man spoke quietly : " Lucy , it 's a buffalo . " His reel pole had indeed gently quivered . I stood up to watch the proceedings better . He reached over and took the reel pole and got ready . The cork had not gone down but it continued to move , a slow , almost stately motion . The old man 's face as he set his hook was fiercely intent . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fish plenty of line , enough to get him far out into the river , beyond any chance of entangling the other lines . Then he snubbed him , firmly , not enough to stop him but just enough to put the pressure on . The buffalo is a heavy , logy fish , no fighter after the first rush . He soon showed his white belly . The old man reeled him in . His wife slipped the landing net under him . The old man , elated by the fight , put on more worms and cast back . He had lit his pipe and was sitting back resting , but evidently alert for the next bite . The next bite on one of the reel poles was different . The reel fairly screamed and the tip of the rod went deep into the water . The old fellow had trouble holding the pole . He half rose and then sank down again . I heard his voice quavering over the water . " Lucy  --  Lucy , it 's a big channel cat . " There was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the finish and the old man knew it . He was sitting back with all his might when there was a report like the crack of a small pistol . The line had snapped  --  bing ! The old fellow was sagging back in his seat . His hand fumbled in his pocket , then went up to wipe his forehead . " That was n't any channel cat , " he said . " It was a yellow cat . Must a been fifty pounds . " I had been so interested in the fishing that I had not heard Tom come quietly up through the cane . He stood now looking down and smiling as the old man 's voice drifted up to us again : " Lucy . . . Lucy . . . D' you bring the chicken entrails ? " " The old scoundrel , " Tom said . " I bet he baits that hole every day . . . . Well , you ready to go ? " I said I was , and we started up the path . But before I went I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head was still visible through a rift of the trees . His back wasp253toward me but I saw suddenly his face , as it had been upturnedthere for one moment . The clear blue eyes on either side of the bold Roman nose . . . . Some part of my brain labelled the image ... . Tom , a few feet ahead , had turned around : " What 'd I say that old fellow 's name was ? " " Wyndham , " I said , " Colonel Wyndham . " The spawning season was over . The bass and crappie , havingmillions of little perch to feed on grew like magic . I took a few every now and then and found that almost invariably a three-pound bass would be an inch thick at the root of the tail . One afternoon I was sitting in my boat repairing a seine when a car stopped at the head of the lake and a thick-set , red-faced young man got out . He stood a few minutes eyeingthe water and occasionally stealing a glance at me . " This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What do you charge for fishing ? " " I have never made any charge , " I said . " Can I go ahead ? " I nodded again . " There 's a cane pole leaning up against that sycamore , " I said . He had gone around to the back of his car and had got his rod out and was already jointing it up . He favored-me now with a careless smile . " I do n't fish with a cane pole , " he said . I rowed over to where he was standing and got out . " That 's a pretty rod you 've got , " I said as he finished jointingit up . " It ought to be . It cost fifty dollars . " I took his rod in my hand . It was a beauty , limber as a willow but strong too ; with an anti-backlash device . That meant that he was probably not as good as he thought he was or at least that he had little confidence in himself . Still it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better not put it in here . These fish are fed . They 'll tear that rod to pieces . " He looked up truculently . " Sa  --  ay , you said I could fish in this lake . " " All right , you 're the doctor , " I said and went back and got in my boat . From my station in the willows I watched him wade out into the water . He had bent a leader and was laying out the line . It dropped as light as a rose leaf . He was good , all right , and he knew where to find them . That bunch of willowsabout fifty feet from the bank was going to be his objective . . The fly lit within a few inches of the willows . A five-pounder had hit it . The tip of the rod had bent back so far it was striking him on the hand . I rowed my boat out into the lake to get a clearer view of the fight . He had becometoo excited or the fish was pulling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough line . And now he was trying to back out of the pond . He fell twice but he still had his fish hooked . Finally he dragged him up on the bank , a magnificentfive-pound bass . He dropped the rod , seized the fish and unhooked him . As he got in his car and started the motorhe raised his hand once in ironic salute : " You had the dope , all right , Old Man ! " I sat there on the bank awhile after he was gone . The rod was still lying there beside me . He had lifted it only to take the reel off  --  it was irretrievably buckled . I picked it up and moved it back and forth in my hand thoughtfully , going over in imagination the different movements of the play . If he had moved backward almost in the same instant that he had hooked the fish or if even after that he had managed top255get out enough line . . . Looking down and seeing my wrist flex back and forth in the imaginary play I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand . It had been over a year now since I had had it out ... . Three days later . I was sitting under the great sugar tree . It was eight o'clock and by rights I should have been on the lake an hour ago . My unusual idleness had provoked some comment from the family . Jim going by on his way to the barn had called out to know what was the matter with me and Mrs. Buford had come to the door only a few minutes ago : " I believe you 're going to be sick . . . . I told you you ought not to eat that berry pie . " " No , " I said absently . " No , I 'm quite well .... " I looked down at the letter I held in my hand . It was from the game warden of Florida to whom I had written over a week ago , desiring information about Florida waters . In my new-found elation I had written in humorous vein : " I 'm going to get a line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a reel and catch at least one big fish to have my picture taken with but what I really want to know is where in Florida can a man go and be sure of not taking any big fish ? I have a rod that I think a lot of . I do n't want to risk it in the wrong kind of water . " The game warden had replied in kind . He was going to have my letter framed and hang it in his office for I was the only man he had ever heard of coming to Florida who did not want to take big fish . . . . My mind veered from his pleasantries to the body of the letter . It had not been particularlyreassuring : he did not think that there was in the whole of Florida exactly the kind of water  --  running water  --  that I was seeking . The Withlicoochee in north Florida was probably more like my Tennessee rivers than any other . He advised me to try the lake country . There was Lake Harris at Leesburg , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of twenty feet , teeming with bass , crappie , bream . . . . And at Orlando there were thirty lakes within the city limits . Easily accessible too . You could sit in a boat and cast a fly inside the court-house window . On the whole , though , he thought I would prefer Lake Harris ... . I looked up . Wisdom was at my elbow . Something had gone wrong with the door to one of the fish traps and he had brought it up to be fixed . I took the pair of pliers from his hands and set about it . When I had finished and had handed the wire door back to him I looked out over the water of the larger lake . It was all over , as dead as cold mutton . My feeding traps , my shelters , my carp pen , all the devices I had taken such pains with . I wondered only how they could have held me so long . Well , let anybody have them that would . They had served my purpose but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been on me was gone , suddenly , while I watched that fellow battling his bass or when I got again the feel of a rod in my hand . No matter . . . . It was over and done with . I was going to fish again and fish hard . The problem was where to go . I could not stay here . This Indian summer could not last . In a month , in two more weeks perhaps the leaves would all be gone . And then would follow months when I would be confined to the house with nothing to do but go over my fishing tackle ... . I got up and walked into the house . There was no one in the hall or sitting-room but I heard voices from the kitchen and went on back . Mrs. Buford standing by the rolling block making out rolls looked up enquiringly :  | " Mrs. Buford , " I said , " I believe I 'm going to have to go away . . . . " Mrs. Buford looked over at the elderly grim-visaged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I told you this morning ... . When he went out and sat down in that chair after breakfastinstead of going up in his room to smoke his pipe ... . I said right then I knew he was in for a spell . .. . " I 'm not sick , " I said , " but I 've got to go away . . . for the winter , anyhow .... " Mrs. Buford had taken her hands out of the flour and was washing them at the sink . " Here , " she said opening her medicine cabinet and taking down a small brown bottle . " I 'm going to mix you up a dose of phosphate of soda . You take it now and then take another dose at bedtime and by tomorrowyou wo n't even know there was anything the matter with you . " " There 's not anything the matter with me , " I protested . " But I 've decided I 've got to go to Florida . I may have to leave right away . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now , listen , you all have been mighty good to me . And I 've been a lot of trouble . You must let me pay you two months board in advance , going off suddenly like this .... " Mrs. Buford brushed the suggestion aside . Who , she wanted to know , would nurse me if I got sick next winter like I had last winter ? She was not one to take any undue credit to herself and Heaven knows she had done all she had done willingly but where would I have been if there had n't been somebody around to put hot compresses on my leg , and I might have forgotten it now in the spring but there had been two weeks , two weeks straight when Jim had had to dress and undress me like a baby and it was not as if I were easy to handle either , being as fleshy as I was . . . . I nodded assent to all this and then in my desperation anp258idea came to me . " That 's just it , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do , he 's got no business trying to live through a winter in this climate .... " Mrs. Buford , halted as it were in mid-air , could not think of any immediate come-back to this . She gazed upon me while her upper lip trembled with the words that in a momentwould be rushing forth . Elated I slipped the gaff home : " My daughter 's been after me now a long time so I just decided I 'd try it one winter , anyhow .... " Mrs. Buford 's upper lip still trembled but words as yet had not come . I turned and left the room . Upstairs in my own haven I sat down on the foot of the bed and looking about me tried to plan which things I would take with me and which I would discard . The minnow trap was too bulky and I could make a new one easily anyhow . My second best minnow bucket , too , it had sprung a hole . I could solder it but I would leave it behind . It was fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me , troublesomeas they 'd be . . . . Thank heaven the cases of all three of my rods were as good as new . There was a tap on the door and Mrs. Buford slipped in . She supposed it had n't occurred to me that I could n't go off with all my clothes soiled . Of course it was Thursday alreadyand Aunt Viry would be pretty mad about having to wash in the middle of the week ... . I got up and assisted her as best I could in getting my laundry up . She threw the clothes all down in the middle of the floor and then began sorting them into piles and countingthem . As she sorted and counted she spoke of her fatherwho it seemed had been headstrong even as I was . " When he was going on seventy-five he took a notion and nothing would do him but to go out and see my sister that lives in Iowa . I said to Jim that morning we took him top259the train . Jim , ' I says , it ai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mark my words , Papa 'll never see Kentuckyagain . ' " I nodded sympathetically while she counted my shirts . The old gentleman it seemed had managed to give everybody a lot of trouble , having to be buried in a blinding snow storm with the ground frozen so hard it tools six men working 111 day to dig the grave ... . " Too bad , " I said , " too bad .... " and was startled to rindmy lips curving into a smile . Other familiar , always new words had suddenly begun to say themselves over in my mind : " White sand bottom . . . clear as air ... willow fringed .... " Yes , it would be Lake Harris . Leesburg was a small place but there was evidently some tourist trade for half a dozen taxis were drawn up in ( runt of the station . I stood there for a few minutes warding them off until I caught sight of an old negro whose decrepit Ford bore the word " Taxi " in glaring yellow letters . I le was wrinkled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be waterwise enough to advise me . " Uncle , " I said when he had made his way through the crowd , " I 've come down here to fish and I want a place to stay , near as I can get to the lake . I do n't want to pay no big price either . Now , you fix me up . " He stood cogitating a moment , his pendulous lip caught between his teeth . " You do n't want to stay at no rev ' Aar hotel ? Miz Latham , over on Second Street , she takes roomers . " We drove over to Mrs. Latham 's . She was a pleasant-appearingwoman and the odors coming just then front the kitchen made me feel that I should have liked to sample herp260cooking but the bed in the room she showed me was frail ; I saw at a glance that it would not support me . We tried Mrs. Baden 's next . This too was a pleasant house but there were two stairs to climb to the only availableroom ; it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drove away regretfully . The morning wore on . I was hot and very tired . But I knew that I would have to stick it out . There were certain things that were for me necessities : a room large enough to accommodate all my traps and a bed luxurious enough to ensuremy getting a good night 's rest . There must also be a table and at least one chair sturdy enough to bear my weight . ( I hardly hoped to find two such chairs in one room . There never had been in my own home . ) These requirements seemed simple enough on the surface but I knew from past experience that every one must be met if I was to keep in proper trim to enjoy my sport . There was too , to complicate matters , the necessity of being within easy walking distance of the water . Those few cold days in Kentucky had already sent some ominous twinges up my game leg ; I would have to coddle it a bit if I were to keep going . It was after eleven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shade of a tree snapping his fingers as if a particularly bright thought had just come to him . " You done put me off saying you didn ' want to go to no reg'lar hotel . Man , why n't I ca'y you to the Junaventa house long ago ? It 's right on the lake . " I said I did n't know why in the devil he had n't and would he drive there now as fast as he could . It was a pleasant , old-fashioned looking white house , surrounded by mimosa and palms , and not more than a fiveminutewalk from the lake . The proprietress rose to greet me from a rocking chair on the porch . I saw that she had a cheerful countenance  --  there has never been but one sombrep261face that I liked to have around me . Yes , she had a room vacant , she said . It was on the first floor and  --  this with a smile at my figure  --  the bed was plenty strong enough to hold me up . The room opened on one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in and out in my fishing clothes without having to run a battery of eyes . That pleased me ; I was resolved to take the room even before she opened I the door and I saw that it did meet all my requirements  --  ; except the chair . There was none strong enough to hold me but Mrs. Bellows with another smile said that she would see about that . I collapsed now in the " strong " chair which Mrs. Bellowshad brought in and sat mopping my face and smoking while my old man brought my traps in . There was half an hour before dinner . I used the interval to bathe and change into other clothing and I felt refreshed by the time lunch was served . The dining-room faced over the lake with a beautiful view from its windows . There were not more than ten or twelve people there for lunch , well-dressed , middle-aged women mostly . There were only two other men besides myself . One was a young fellow who looked as if he might be a clerk in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came into the room on the arm of his daughter , a woman of about fifty . My table companion was a woman of about the same age with pretty faded blue eyes and blonde hair streaked with gray . She confined herself at first to " Please hand me the salt " and a single remark on the weather , when Mrs. Bellowspausing at my table addressed me as Professor Maury . The word " Professor " evidently was a touchstone to the lady ; she addressed me after that with a sort of marked courtesy . We had arrived at the dessert , ice cream . The old gentlemanat the next table evidently did n't like it for he pushed his saucer away with a pettish exclamation and began the intricatebusiness of hauling himself up to leave the room . I watched him get slowly to his feet and stand panting a little , while his daughter came around from her side of the table and slipped her arm under his shoulder . As he passes 1 by us I observed that his eyes under their wrinkled lids had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be very old , well over eighty . Eighty , I said , and then pulled myselfup with a start ; I myself had celebrated or rather allowed to pass unnoticed my seventieth birthday only the other day . The lady opposite was smiling sentimentally after the old man : " I 've been trying to get him interested in Eurythmics . It would be so good for his rheumatism . " I did not think that Eurythmics or anything else would ever animate that battered hulk but I did n't care to engage in altercation with the lady so I bowed and left the table . My impulse was to go straight down to the lake whose waters I could see glittering not a stone 's throw from the house , but it always upsets me to hurry my after-dinner smoke . So I curbed the impulse and sat down in one of the rocking chairs ranged on the porch . As I sat down I realized that my right leg was trembling , that I could hardly have stood upon it much longer if the morning 's ordeal had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go slow for a time . But I would make it . I had got soft , idling around on that lake ; I could get in trim again very quickly now that I had an incentive . Right now , exhausted as I was , I felt a longing for a good hard day 's casting ... . The lady who had been my table companion had come out and was taking her place in the next rocker . She bent f orwardsmiling : " I must beg your pardon . I did n't quite catch your name at dinner . "   " Maury , ma'am , " I said . " Aleck Maury . " The lady said that she was Mrs. Oldham . She lived part of the year with her son in Detroit . It was so cold in Detroitthat she always tried to get away before the first of November . It was n't the same coming here without Doctor Oldham , though of course there was a great deal going on . So many excellent lectures and a friend of hers had started a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From here the water was a clear , almost sky blue . Sitting here and looking at it made me want very much to go out on it . But I knew that it would be better to stick by the program I had outlined for myself and rest for this one afternoon . I had gone fishing once or twice in my life when I was not up to it . The results had been appalling ; a staleness that somehow hung on and spoiled even the next day 's sport ... . Mrs. Oldham was leaning forward , a faint , puzzled smile on her face . I recalled myself hastily . " I beg your pardon , " I said , " I did n't quite catch what you were saying . " " Doctor Arthur , " she said , " Doctor J. Hamilton Arthur . He lectures every Tuesday and Thursday . " She coughed delicately . " There 's no charge of course . " I nodded , glumly perhaps , and continued to gaze over the lake . Mrs. Bellows had come out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her hand . Airs . Oldham was rolling up her knitting and the landlady took her seat in the rocker while she was waiting for her . Mrs. Oldham , having slipped her sweateror whatever it was into a striped bag that hung on her chair arm , rose to go . " I was just telling Professor Maury about Doctor Arthur'slectures . " The landlady who had been leaning back in her chair rose smiling .   " We 'd better go now , " she said , " if we want to get a good seat . " They had left the porch and were at the gate . Mrs. Oldhamwalked springily but poor Mrs. Bellows , weary nog doubt from her morning 's labors , had a less elastic striele . As the gate clanged to behind her she looked back at mc . " You 'd better come too , " she said . " It 'll help to kill the time . " I stood there too astounded even to answer . I have never given much consideration to what other people think of me ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care what figure I cut . Yet as I turned and went back into the house I was annoyed to reflect that anybody could think that I , Alexander Maury , could need to kill time ! I was up early the next morning and started down to the lake . The occasion  --  the first time I had cast a fly for nearly two years -- called for my best rod : the Tucker Special ( it is ten feet long , nine splits of bamboo welded together , four and a half ounces , perfectly balanced with a whip like lightning ) . In my tackle box I put a No. 3 spinner and a Black Gnat tied on a No. 4 hooka The black Gnat tied on a No. 4 bronze hook is the most dependable of all-round fly baits . The No. 4 hook is small enough for bream . and all kinds of perch but the wire is so strong and the beard so heavy that it will hold any fish that the rod can handle . I debated a while between a No. 2 and a No. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Some people may think that a No. 3 spinneris a size large for a fly rod . But the No. 3 always spins while a No. 2 or No. r fails to spin half the time . And the bait is dead unless the spinner spins . My preparations made  --  I had gone out right after break-P265fast and bought myself a large sun hat  --  I took my way to the lake . Its slopes were heavily fringed with cypress . In their shadow the water of the farther shore looks ( ! him k hot 1wtweenme and it was a broad band of shining translucent rot blue . Some rank grasses grew out for some dt%ta n r into the water . I passed the boathouse and went out to the end of the dock . Standing there I could look down a depth of ten fret to a white sand bottom . The game warden was right . It was an clear as air . My eye swept the shore again . I was glad It wan so heavily wooded . Even the sight of shade rests a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who kept the boathouse had come tip and wanted to know if I wanted a boat . I told hint that I slid . adding that I was hard to please . He pursed his lips , then said I 'd better come look ' em over . We went down the steps to where the little flotilla lay at anchor . I had looked them over and was about to pick one out when I looked up and saw a man far out in the lake rowing leisurely . His stroke interested me . It was so slow that I could n't see how he was making such time . Then my eyes went to the boat . It was one of the prettiest things I have ever wro. sixteen feet long , the bow ending in a sharp point ruin ( illy three and a half feet in the beam . As he drew closer , I noticed that it seemed not to draw any water at all . He had beached her and was running up the dock strim . A blue-eyed young fellow with a body bronzed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet him . " You do n't by any chance want to sell that boat ? " He smiled , evidently a bit taken back by my abruptness . " As it happens , " he said , " I do . I 've got to leave next week and I do n't know that I 'll be coming here again . "
