Japan 's plan to capture Hankow , China 's acting capital , is first to cut all the city 's communications , then gradually encircle it . Last week , a Japanese column tightened the net around the capital by capturing strategic Hwangchwan , north of the Yangtze . Another column captured one of a series of river booms at Wusueh , 100 miles down the river from Hankow . Meanwhile , Japanese aviators bombed away at their main objective , the Canton-Hankow Railway . <P> Since the start of the 14-months ' - old war this line has been bombed in 1,300 places . Speedy repair work has held the periods of service interruptions to a minimum , and last week trains were still running , albeit irregularly . Most remarkable testimony to Chinese ingenuity was that the 680-mile run from Canton to Hankow has been shortened to 36 hours instead of the old 45-hour schedule .

This year the Soviet Union has contracted to buy $15,000,000 worth . Already shipped to Hong Kong from Hankow this year are 15,000 half-chests ( 975,000 pounds ) of brick tea from Hunan and Hupeh , about half of last year 's stock . <P> Hankow remained calm last week , while her foreign language radio program " Voice of China " radiated confidence in Chinese arms . Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek appealed to Chinese Manchukuoans to transform that Japanese-dominated state into a " graveyard for the Japanese .
