One period during the year when prominent U. S. newspapermen express themselves from the forum instead of the type font is the University of Missouri 's Journalism Week . To Columbia , Mo . last week went 350 guests of the University 's School of Journalism to take part in the 27th Journalism Week , the first without the presence of Dr. Walter Williams , founder of the school and president of the University from 1931 until his death last July . <P> Most important speaker lined up by Dean Frank Lee Martin , Dr. Williams ' successor and longtime associate , was President Hugh Baillie of United Press . Addressing Journalism School students and guests , United Pressman Baillie painted a sad picture of Press censorship and repression the world over , perked up sufficiently to declare : " I envy you men and women who are just starting in . You 've got a lot of fun ahead of you ! " <P> A lot of fun was had right there by all those who heard two other Journalism Week orators . Bronzed , bushy-haired Publisher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Physical Culture took the platform to explain the secret of his success in the publishing business , part of which he credited to curiosity . <P> " It pays to ask questions , " declared body-loving Publisher Macfadden . " Take my hotel down in Florida . If you could see how the girls dress down there ! Nothing but a pair of shorts and two breast cups . It pays to ask questions ! Ribald laughter . I 'm sure you boys are n't thinking the same thing I am . " <P> More conscious was Hearstian Humorist Arthur ( " Bugs " ) Baer 's attempt to be funny . Sample crack : <P> ' ' Before I came here my boss got a wire from Dean Martin that said ' Like to have Bugs Baer in Missouri . ' The boss wired back , ' so would I. ' " <P> Among the awards made during the six-day ceremony , one went to Publisher Ogden Mills Reid of the New York Herald Tribune , who gratefully accepted a citation for his paper 's " typography and makeup @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intelligent readers who desire urbane writing and unusual treatment . . . for consistently maintaining departments of nationally recognized superiority conducted by commentators of extraordinary discernment.
