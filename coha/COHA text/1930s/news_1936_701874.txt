With his arrival here at 8:47 A. M. ( Central standard time ) following his capture by Federal agents in New Orleans last night . it was disclosed that the outlaw had emulated John Dillinger in having his face altered by plastic surgery in an attempt to perfect his disguise . " But even with the plastic surgery he was easily recognizable from his picture , " said J. Edgar Hoover , director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation , who took personal charge in the capture and return of Karpis . " He had two scars on his ears , apparently for the purpose of lifting his face , and a cut in the lobe of each ear . But he still looks exactly like his picture .

" The sullen young bandit was landed here slightly more than twelve hours after he left the Louisiana city in a " prison plane , " guarded by eight Federal agents . Shivering in a temperature just above freezing , somewhat out of keeping with his Summer suit and straw hat , Karpis was hustled from the plane immediately after it was taxied into a National Guard hangar . He was put in one of a group of five automobiles and , surrounded by machine guns in the speedy trip , was taken to the Federal Building .

He said Karpis was " so damned scared he could n't talk " when the agents swarmed around his car in front of the pretentious apartment house in which he had been living . " Karpis said he 'd never be taken i alive , " Mr. Hoover said , " but we took him without firing a shot . That marked him as a dirty , yellow rat . He was scared to death when we closed in on him .

" Mr. Hoover revealed that several persons suspected of harboring Karpis were expected to be arrested soon . The entire department was following every connection the gangster had , he said , and " it is a good chance that there will be a number of arrests soon . " Karpis 's capture was the culmination of a long and patient manhunt , which carried agents through many States , Mr. Hoover declared .

" During the flight here Karpis laughingly declared he had " an ironclad alibi " for at Least one crime of which he was accused , Mr. Hoover said . A newspaper story which the gangster read told that a Sheriff had identified him as one of five participants in a robbery in Detroit yesterday .

Karpis already is under indictment for the Hamm and Bremer kidnappings . He also was sought for the slaying of a Sheriff in Missouri , fifteen bank robberies , three or four mail hold-ups , and complicity in the slaying of several other persons , Mr. Hoover said . Karpis was held temporarily in the Federal Building here , but it was expected he would be moved to the Ramsey County Jail and held there until arraigned . Even when he is placed in the county jail , Karpis will be guarded by Department of Justice agents , and the agents made preparations today to provide a guard as they have done In other instances when dangerous criminals have been held there .

Karpis was shackled hand and foot and chained to his seat during the journey . Mr. Hoover had chartered the fourteen-passenger " prison plane " in the East and took it along with him when he went to New Orleans to seize the outlaw . The plane left New Orleans at 8:30 o'clock last night , sped northward to Indianapolis , and then detoured West to St. Louis and Kansas City . It waited at the latter city three and a half hours for better flying conditions . To insure secrecy , it was known in airline radio dispatches only as " Flight No. 7 .

The route of a mile and a half from the airport to the Federal Building was patroled by police squad cars and deputy sheriffs . The car used to transport the prisoner from the airport had been waiting in the hangar . A moment after its passenger and his guards were loaded in , the machine shot out of the hangar and , escorted by the other cars , raced to the Federal Building . There the outlaw was hurried from the machine at a brisk trot , with the large crowd of spectators that had assembled scarcely getting a glimpse of him .
