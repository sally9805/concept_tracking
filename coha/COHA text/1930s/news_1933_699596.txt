txt Strong indications that the administration 's plan for relieving agriculture will undergo major changes before it is enacted into law appeared toil day on Capitol Hill . Neither Democratic nor Republican leaders cared to criticize the bill sent to Congress with a message from the President on Thursday , except to call it a " college professor 's plan , " but two of the stanchest supporters of Mr. Roosevelt , Senators Bulkley and Smith , put forward alternate , simplified plans . Senator Bulkley sponsored a proposal prepared by Adrian Adelman of Franklin , Pa. , a youthful lawyer , who would have the government tax farmers not in money but in produce to the extent necessary to absorb surplus production , holding and selling such produce when the market became favorable . Senator Bulkley conferred with the President yesterday . Senator Smith , whose twenty-four years of agricultural studies in the Sende are buttressed by experience as a life-long cotton grower , veered toward the leasing of enough land to cut out surplus production . These substitute plans were founded , it was evident , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which has grown greater in proportion as legislators have studied its ramifications . Objections to Pending Bill . The Senate Agriculture Committee devoted all of yesterday to studying the bill , examining Secretary Wallace and his associates behind closed doors . From a reliable source it was learned that only two of the members of this committee , Senators Wheeler and Frazier , favor reporting the administration bill without change . The House Agriculture " lomnaittee studied the bill today , but re= gardless of individual sentiment among House members they may pass the measure because it has the approval of the Democratic leaders . Three primary objections to the administration bill of a serious nature are voiced by Senators who have discussed it privately . The first is , as was expected , to the power given to the Secretary of Agriculture , who would hold complete authority over the production and marketing of agricultural produce . The second is to the setting up of an " army " of tax gatherers and so-called . : ommittees who , it is held , would watch the operations of virtually every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The third objection is advanced by those with an economic bent , who maintain that to raise artificially the domestic price of agricultural products , while presumably dumping the surplus abroad at any price obtainable , would ruin the foreign commerce of those who export agricultural products . Effect on Exporters . Lard and flour are cited as agricultural products which could not be sold in foreign markets if United States packers and millers had to pay possibly twice the world price for the raw materials needed for their manufacture . Another example cited relates to cotton . If cotton were sold to spinners in this country for 12 cents a pound while government agencies were selling it abroad for 6 cents a pound , say commentators , foreign spinners not only would capture the foreign cloth market but no tariff walls could be erected high enough to keep them from competing in the United States with domestic spinners . These objections are discounted by leaders of farm organizations , but they are receiving serious consideration by Senators who believe that the welfare of domestic agriculture is joined with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Senate Agriculture Committee , who asked that his name be not used , described two examples of what he termed " impractical thought and inexperience " behind the administration measure . He cited a question put by Senator Norris , who asked one of the officials of the Department of Agriculture ? in the committee session yesterday if ' a farmer who made a few pounds of sausage from a butchered pig to sell to his neighbors would have to be licensed as a processor . The answer was " yes . " Again , when Senator Smith asked if a small mill that ground cornmeal for the people in a South Carolina community , none of the meal being sold but used by the people who took the corn to the mill , also would have to have a license and pay a processor 's tax , the answer was " yes . " Senator Bulkley 's Plan . Senator Bulkley 's plan has for its chief purpose the curtailment of production of surplus crops to domestic needs and provides for a tax to bring about a horizontal reduction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ others , however , in that it is applied to the production of the commodity and can be paid in kind . To use wheat as an example , the plan would work this way : A tax of , say 50 cents , would be assessed against every bushel of wheat grown , but the farmer would pay by delivering to the government one out of every four bushels grown . For this bushel turned over to the government , he would be allowed $2.00 , thus making the one bushel removed from the channels of commerce pay the tax on the four . Senator Bulkley 's contention is that the United States wheat producer must get on a domestic basis and stay there . He asserts that the farmer , through the operation of his plan , will be taught to limit his production to ' domestic needs . He believes a farmer will be willing Ito pay a tax of one bushel of wheat if he sees that the returns on the remaining three bushels will be greatly enhanced . As to the prospective carry-over , as of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheat , the Senator thought the tax would have to be applied against that entire amount , to prevent its bearing the market down . Carrying charges against the 1 amount of wheat taken over by the government would not be a great I burden , for the wheat so acquired could be disposed of in several I ways . It could be destroyed , if necessary , to keep the purchasing power of the farmer up . Manufacture into industrial alcohol was another use . If the higher prices encouraged farmers to raise six bushels instead of four , to use the exampled ratio , the government would have to force him to hand over three bushels instead of one , thus assuring production on a domestic basis at all times . The same scheme would be applied to cotton , though in , its case there would be no need to eliminate the foreign market which would always exist for United States short staple cotton . The plan would be used to curtail production so as to prevent the huge surpluses of recent years . Studied by House Group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee met twice today to study the President 's measure . At the morning session slow progress was made , for only six pages of the bill were read before noon adjournment . " There are so many new members we do n't seem to be getting ahead , " Chairman Jones of Texas remarked . The reading of the bill was completed at the afternoon session , but no further action was taken . Members of the committee , some still puzzled over the intricate sections , took copies home for further study . Mr. Jones said that no further steps could be expected before Monday . He ordered the committee to meet again in executive session that afternoon . As . for Senator Smith 's plan , he said that " if the raising of prices is the principal object , ' the leasing project can be made simple , direct and effective . " He estimated that 350,000,000 acres of land are in production in the United States ; that 15 per cent , or 55,000,000 acres , could ba leased at an average of about $4 an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surplus would be negligible . His solution , involving an estimated cost of $220,000,000 , would be financed by having each class of agricultural products raise the amount necessary to curtail production and eliminate surplus in that crop . Farmers Appeal to Congress . Leaders of the six major farms organizations today joined in another appeal for the administration bill , joining in a letter sent to each member of Congress . " The very important emergency legislation enacted by the Seventythird Congress has not dealt with the fundamental question of economic reconstruction , " the letter said . " It has improved confidence in banking and anticipates economy in governmental costs . " As ' a part of the constructive program for economic rehabilitation , the President , by a special message to Congress , has designated agricultural relief as the first prerequisite thereto . The bill now before Congress bears the support of the President and farm organizations . " We how , that the unanimity of the nation 's executive branch and of farm organizations will encourage your prompt and effective support of the present bill for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the American Farm Federation ; L. J. Taber of the National Grange , C. E. Huff of the Farmers National Grain Corporation , C. G. Henry of the American Cotton Cooperative Association , Charles E. Ewing of the National Livestock Marketing Association and Ralph Snyder of the National Committee of Farm Organizations . Today 's ' callers at the White House included iienatnt : Nye , : who discussed with President Roosevelt the question of refinancing farm mortgage indebtedness as well as the mortgages of small home owners . Senator Nye refused to discuss President Roosevelt 's ideas on the subject , but said : " I am convinced that the President is giving attention to it and that we are going to get a refinancing program for agriculture and the small home-owner . I am highly elated with what is in prospect . I am satisfied that this Congress will not quit until legislation has been passed which will salvage homes and farms . " Senator Smith conferred with Secretary Wallace and Henry Morgenthau Jr. , chairman of the Farm Board , afterward expressing the opinion that complete agriculture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exclusively for farmers .
