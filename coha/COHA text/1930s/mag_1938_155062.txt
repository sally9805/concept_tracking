The period of pioneering in the U. S. was the Covered Wagon Era . Corresponding period in South Africa was the Great Trek . Last week in Pretoria , South Africa , the 100th Anniversary of the Great Trek was celebrated in a wild clash of nostalgic happiness and partisan bitterness . <P> " Boer " is the Dutch form of the English word " boor " in its original meaning-farmer . In the 1830s the Dutch farmers in South Africa decided they would rather live among Zulus and Basutos than live under the thumbs of greedy English traders . Accordingly they set out in oxcarts , migrated inland . Years later they were absorbed again by the spreading sponge of British rule which made them not-too-loyal citizens of the U. S. A. ( Union of South Africa ) . <P> Months of preparation were devoted to the anniversary of the Boer 's futile trek for freedom . Three men in every four grew beards-symbols of Boer virility and spiritual grace . A caravan of eight oxcarts set out to follow the route of the original trek . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instigation of German spellbinders the hysteria shaded from pride in pioneer traditions , to intense nationalism , to open hatred of British and Jews . <P> In towns with English mayors , the mayors were allowed to welcome the wagons only on sufferance . Jewish mayors were rudely told to keep away . Finally even the pro-Boer South African Broadcasting Corp . was obliged to censor speeches . Ministers of the Dutch Reformed Church piled spiritual coals on the political fire . They declared that the wagons represented the Biblical Ark , that their axle grease would cure diseases , that children baptized in the wagons would lead blessed lives . The Czech crisis and the German pogroms were excuses for severe nationalistic outbreaks . In Johannesburg bearded Fascists fell on a band of antiFascists with iron bars , bicycle chains , knives , revolvers ; over 100 were injured . In Benoni a synagogue was blown to the Promised Land . <P> Climax of the celebration was the arrival in Pretoria of the eight dusty wagons . Because the Boers and their backers would not sing God Save the King @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away . The crowd of 150,000 would not listen to English . So a message from King George VI was read in Afrikaans , the Boer language . Then a tattered Transvaal flag , saved from falling into British hands in the Boer War , was unfurled high on the site of a monument soon to be erected to the Voertrekkers.
