If 955,072 people in the U. S. got sick at the same moment there would be enough hospital beds for them . But if residents in 40% of the counties in the U. S. got sick they would find no hospital for community use in their counties . These and other facts were given out in the ninth annual hospital report of the American Medical Association , released last week . <P> Other facts : there are 187 fewer " approved " hospitals than last year ; 504 hospitals last year lost their " approved " rating ; hospitals for nervous and mental cases are increasing more rapidly than all other types combined ; nervous and mental cases hospitalized increased from 349,667 in 1927 to 395,407 last year ; " by 1934 we will have more than 500,000 " such cases .
