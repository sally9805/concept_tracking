Home Thoughts ( Cont 'd ) <P> A notably unmelodious voice last week brought cheer to Congressmen sick for home amid the alien corn of Washington . <P> Except President Roosevelt , no man could predict the magic date of adjournment with more authority than Senate Majority Leader Joseph Taylor Robinson . Last week Senator Robinson clopped out of the President 's office , observed : " We want to speed adjournment all we can . Of course , there are several bills still in conference between the Senate and the House for final adjustment , and there are some others that the President would like to see action upon . . . . Under the circumstances I feel we will be fortunate to get through by Aug. 20 . " Lending weight to the Majority Leader 's cautious hint was the fact that President Roosevelt wants to get away to address on Aug. 23 the Young Democrats of America convening in Milwaukee , does not want to leave Congress in session to nip at his fast-flying political heels . It was up to Congress , therefore , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it wanted to be finished by that date . The great bulk of the New Deal program for 1935 last week lay jammed in a bottleneck . <P> Measures yet to be passed by one or both bodies of Congress : The Tax Bill passed the House , got into the Senate Finance Committee ( see p. 12 ) . <P> To the House Ways &; Means Committee a subcommittee handed , without recommendation , the Coal Stabilization Bill minus the doubtfully constitutional provision for Government purchase of $300,000,000 worth of submarginal coal mines . <P> The Senate Banking &; Currency Committee agreed on a " Gold-Clause " Suit Bill rewritten to permit suits filed within six months of the bill 's enactment . <P> Already passed by the House , the Federal Alcohol Control Bill was in the hands of the Senate Finance Committee . <P> The Senate bill to put buses &; trucks under the Interstate Commerce Commission was passed by the House with minor amendments , sent back to the Senate , which promptly approved the changes , sent the measure to the President for signature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in conference last week : <P> After waiting during the week for the return of South Carolina 's " Cotton Ed " Smith , Chairman of the Senate Agriculture &; Forestry Committee , from a trip home , conferees on the AAAmendments reached agreement when House members yielded most of the way on two Senate changes . <P> They consented : to no price fixing except for milk ; to recovery suits by processing tax payers who had not passed their taxes back to farmers or along to consumers- decision as to whether the taxes had been passed along to be left to the Commissioner of Internal Revenue . <P> TVAmendments conferees were reported ' ' about half through " their work , with no major disagreements in prospect . <P> Having been agreed for some time on a partial report covering all other features of the Social Security Bill , conferees recessed until this week to await completion of a complex compromise aimed at breaking their long deadlock on the Senate 's amendment permitting private old-age pension systems .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
