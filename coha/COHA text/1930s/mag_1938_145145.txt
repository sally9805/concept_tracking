" . . . I think it is a healthful thing not to have the country represented too predominately by either party , for it puts both on their mettle . On the whole , I think it is as easy to put through a well-thought-out program when the two major parties are more nearly equally represented in Congress . " <P> Such were the morning-after sentiments of cheery Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt . But not for two days did her husband tell the press how he felt about the election returns . In reply to direct questions he finally said the returns were " all right " ; he did not anticipate a coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats working against him ; his own forecast of Democratic losses had been too small by one Senator , 16 Representatives ; he did not plan to change his legislative program . Oldtime , arch-Republican Correspondent Mark Sullivan , watching Franklin Roosevelt intently from the massed ranks of reporters , admitted that he looked " poised and cheerful . " <P> Three courses seemed to lie before this President who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three successive elections , now suddenly felt that hold loosen , 1 ) He could press ahead with his legislative reforms , forcing issues to bring about the national Liberal v. Conservative realignment he had undertaken . 2 ) He could acquiesce in the new independence of Congress and let it work out its own solutions to controversial problems like Labor law and Social Security revision , railroad rehabilitation , while he led on toward larger , less controversial goals such as national Rearmament and security for the Western Hemisphere . 3 ) He could seek by placation and compromise to restore harmony within his own party . <P> A combination of courses 2 and 3 was indicated last week , by Franklin Roosevelt 's assertion that he anticipated no coalition against him , and by a remark of Majority Leader Sam Rayburn , who conferred at length with the President after his return to the White House from Hyde Park . Said Mr. Rayburn : " Now Democrats will be more inclined to be Democrats . " <P> Ambitious Mayor LaGuardia of New York City last week tried to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excited about the setback progressives had suffered , the necessity for rallying their scattered forces . Mr. Murphy , after four hours at the White House with Franklin Roosevelt , declared : " Progressivism can and must go forward , but I believe it must be . . . through the Democratic Party . There is little chance for success through a third party . " <P> The President last week : opened the annual American Red Cross Drive ( " We must all do our part " ) ; greeted the American Philatelic Society , convening in Hartford , Conn . ( " It is a hobby that pays rich returns . . . . " ) ; attended Armistice Day ceremonies in Arlington National Cemetery ; received and charm-bathed Cuba 's Dictator Fulgencio Batista wrote to C. I. O in Pittsburgh plugging peace with A.F. of L. " in the interest of all Americans . " <P> Aroused by Germany 's new paroxysms of Jew-baiting , the State Department ordered Ambassador Hugh R. Wilson home from Berlin to " report and consult " with the President .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
