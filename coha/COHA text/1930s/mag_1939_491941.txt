LEARNING that President-elect and Mrs. Harding were in Washington , visiting the Edward B. McLeans , I asked Mrs. Harding to conic to tea , suggesting that the housekeeper could take her through the White House , so that she might make her plans for occupancy . The usher brought me a reply saying , " Mrs. Harding would be glad to accept and , if agreeable to me , would bring Mrs. McLean . " I was on my way to lunch and sat down at the writing table in the hall and sent a second note suggesting that , since she was coming to go over the house with Mrs. Jaffray , the housekeeper , she would come alone . To this Mrs. Harding replied that she had not understood my first note and would , of course , come alone . She arrived on time , wearing a dark dress , a hat with blue feathers , and her cheeks highly rouged . Her manner was so effusive , so voluble. that after half an hour over the teacups I could hardly stem the torrent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I said Mrs. Jaffray would take her through the house , except the President 's own room , where he was resting . The new mistress of the White House did not shake hands with the housekeeper , but gazed at her through eyeglasses which she put on over a black mesh veil fastened tightly about her rave . I said good-by , explaining it was time for an appointment which would take me out of the house , and so they would have the place to themselves . I did not get in again until 7:30. and I heard a voice far down in the kitchen . It was Mrs. Harding talking to the cook . She remained until after eight o'clock . I did not see her again until March third , when we asked that she and the President-elect come to tea with us . As I recall it , Mrs. Harding wore the same hat as before , but another dress . They both seemed ill at ease and did not stay long . Mr. Harding sat in an armchair , with one leg thrown over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beg that we leave everything in Mr. Wilson 's room undisturbed until March fourth . When we left for the Capitol , he said he would personally see that each article was carried and put in its accustomed setting in Mr. Wilson 's room in the new house . In this way my husband would at once feel at home and would not be inconvenienced on his last night in the White House by the deprivation of the small things that make for the comfort of an invalid . This tender thought on Hoover 's part touched me deeply . I was a little loath to adopt it , wishing to leave everything in perfect condition for Mr. and Mrs. Harding . But faithful Wilkins , the houseman , added his pledge to see that all should be in shape there while Hoover went to the new house ; so I gave my permission . Farewell to the White House T HAD been so busy at the White House that I I had not been able to go to S Street since the night of March second . At that time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were already installed , but on account of delay in getting all the inside work finished , dirt and rubbish covered the lower floors , no rugs were down or pictures hung . For a week or more previous to this , my habit had been to stay with my husband until he got to his room at night , and then , about 10:30 , go to the new house , where my brothers and the servants would he at work . I would help until two or three o'clock in the morning . So the fourth of March dawned . I was anxious about the effect of so much excitement on my husband . But I knew that , cost what it would , he would pay every respect to his successor . I found him ready . His room was in order , with all his personal belongings around him , as though he might return in a few moments . Brooks , the valet , held his high hat and gloves , and gave him the cane which , alas , he could not walk without , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Slowly he walked me to the elevator , where hoover was waiting with the door open . We went straight to the Blue Room , reaching it just as the Ilardings arrived . Greetings soon over , we moved toward the entrance door , where the camera and moving-picture men held sway . The car stood under the porte-cochere , and the President and President-elect , accompanied by Senator Knox and Former Speaker Cannon as escort , entered . Thus the man who had brought our country through war to victory and peace and had given his all in strength and health to make the peace permanent left the White House forever . Mrs. Harding and I followed in another car . As we passed down the drive she called out in hearty tones , first on one side , then the other , greeting the newspaper reporters whom , she explained to me , she called " her boys . " At the Capitol , the accustomed procedure was for the incoming and outgoing Presidents to drive to the front of the building and walk up the steps together @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband 's strength , he explained to Mr. Harding that he would have to take the lower entrance , out of sight of the crowd , and use the elevator , and that arrangements had been made to this end , The chairman of'the Inauguration Committee had told us that he was sure Mr. Harding would accompany the President on his way up in the elevator . However , Mr. Harding alighted from the car and , smiling and waving his hat , ascended the steps , thoughtlessly leaving my husband to drive on alone . The Last Meeting With Lodge I , TR ear followed quickly , and Mrs. Harding fairly raced up the steps . How I longed to follow the lonely figure just . then making hie painful way through the lower entrance . But I knew he would want me to play the game . With a heart hot within me , I followed Mrs. Harding until I joined my husband in the room reserved for the President . At the close of each session of Congress it is the custom for the President to come to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when this is done , a joint committee of both houses notifies the Executive that the Congress has completed the business before it and now stands ready to adjourn unless the President has any further message to communicate . The spokesman of this committee is generally the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , an office at this time held by Senator Lodge . I quote the account which appeared in the Detroit Free Press : " There was only one incident of the day when that cheerful mood seemed to fail . As he stood in the President 's room , Mr. Wilson had been telling Senator Knox he would not witness in the Senate the inauguration of Vice President Coolidge , as he doubted his ability to negotiate the few steps he must climb . A moment later someone touched him on the arm to call his attention to the fact that Senator Lodge had arrived . Mr , Wilson turned toward the man who led the fight against the treaty . His face lost its smile as he listened to the senator 's formal report , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ formality as he said : ' I have no communication to make ; I appreciate your courtesy ; good morning . ' " Driving to our new home , I expressed my indignation at the performance at the Capitol , saying just . what I thought . of it . My husband laughed at my fury and asked what I had expected . He said one could not change human nature ; it ran true to form ; and that he was not the least surprised , Where I was bitter , he was tolerant ; where I resented , he was amused ; and by the time we turned into S Street we were both happy and felt that a great burden had been lifted from our shoulders . To our amazement , we found S Street packed with people . So unexpected and so friendly was this demonstration that we almost wept . Nor was that the only surprise . This house , which , forty-eight hours before , I had last seen in utter confusion below the bedroom floor , was in perfect order  --  curtains and pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flowers everywhere . This was the work of my brother Wilmer , our own and the White House staffs . I learned afterward that they had been without sleep all night . On the threshold of his room my husband leaned on his cane to survey another miracle . Every article was in the relative position it had occupied at the White House  --  all the little things  --  and last of all , the extraordinarily large bed that had been made to order , and which Mr. Wilson bad especially desired , During his illness he had become accustomed to what , in the White House , is known as the " Lincoln bed , " which measures eight feet six inches by six feet two inches . Weeks before , we had ordered a duplicate , which had been delivered only the day previous . But the finest surprise of all was Miss Ruth Powderly , in white cap and uniform , standing by the door to greet us . By rights she had no business there , being a Navy nurse , paid by the Government . Once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ retain her , oven though he should assume the expense . She had insisted , however , on coming " just to stay until you get settled . " It was a comfort to have this capable , dignified girl , and areal loss to think of giving her up . But my husband was inexorable . Deeply as he appreciated her devotion , and much as her service meant to him , he said she could not stay except for the moment . Relief from the burdens of official responsibility was such a boon that the first few days we simply basked in it , doing little except read the mail . This was heavy . Someone sent a page from the Richmond , Missouri , Conservator dressed in black and containing an article headed , THE ' Wour.tomo Sot , DIER WHO NEVER SURRENDERS . While reading this to my husband I had to pause . Woodrow , too , was deeply moved , but his sense of humor came to the rescue . " I am having the unique experience of attending my own obsequies , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " In the article before this , I omitted something important . One morning toward the end of February , the President , the Secretary of State , Mr. Bainbridge Colby , and I had been chatting . Mr. Colby , rising to go , delivered a very graceful little speech to the effect that now that the time was drawing to a close , he wished to say what an honor it had been to serve my husband . Woodrow thanked him and , after expressing his own pleasure in the association , be asked : " Well , Colby , what are you going to do ? " The Secretary stretched his arms out and said : " Oh , I suppose I shall return to New York and open a musty law office again , which , after this experience , will be a dreary business ; but I must make a living . " Plans of an Ex  --  PresIdent M Y HUSBAND smiled and said : " Well , I , too , must make a living . As I was once a lawyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Colby sprang forward and leaned on the desk , saying eagerly : " Do you really mean that , Mr. Presi-dent ? " " Yes , " Mr. Wilson said . " I ca n't face a life of idleness ; besides , I must do something to add to my income . " A moment later they were interrupted by a visitor . Next day Mr. Colby said to me : " I can hardly wait to ask if you think the President was serious . What did he say after I left ? " I told him that in the rush of things we had had no further talk about it and that , frankly , I felt it was said on the impulse of the moment . When he then asked me how I felt about it , I answered with the same candor : that I thought some definite occupation would be essential to Mr. Wilson ; that I knew he dreaded idleness . But  --  that awful little word that destroys so many high hopes  --  I did not see how he could be active @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of cases . Also that it had been many years sines he had done that sort of work , and I feared it would become irksome . The Secretary replied that he recognized all this , but felt it could be so arranged as to obviate the objections . It was not until one of our last days at the White House that I got a chance to bring up the subject . Very soon I realized that my husband had been turning it over in his mind , and that to him it was already a settled matter . At his request I telephoned to ask Mr. Colby to come over . Then I had to leave to keep an appointment , and on my return learned that the Secretary of State had come and gone . Mr. Tumulty was in the study , standing by the desk and saying something about the newspapermen , when Mr. Vilson remarked : " Oh , that reminds me , Tumulty ; you can tell them I have decided to open a law office in partnership with Colby . " The announcement was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Colby attended to the opening of offices in Washington and in New York , under the firm name of Wilson &; Colby . I was // happy at the thought of my husband maintaining a place in the stream of active affairs , and also for a more material reason , as our expenses were running higher than I had calculated , and there were some unpaid bills . Mr. Wilson expected lo spend an hour or so each day in the office . Doctor Grayson 's advice was that Woodrow should not try to begin his office schedule right away . So Mr. Colby would consult him at the house . Case after case was offered , some with truly large retainers . My husband listened while his partner outlined each one . All of them touched in some way the Government structure . My husband would not accept them , saying that his former official position , as well as Colby 's , might tend to influence the deciding authorities in favor of clients of Wilson &; Colby . Poor Mr. Colby , too , had also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time clients he could have represented with absolute propriety went elsewhere simply because my husband felt that an ex-President 's name should not be associated with the litigat Ji War Department Dictum One day the junior partner appeared at our house with his eyes sparkling and his step light . He had an offer of a case with a retainer of $500,000 . " This time , Mrs. Wilson , I am sure we can appear in this case without scruples . " My husband was waiting in the library . Mr. Colby came out of that room a different man . Again Mr. Wilson had felt he could not accept the case . Mr. Colby said : " Of course , I want to go on as long as we can hold out , but day after day I sit in my office and see a procession walk through  --  thousands and thousands of dollars , and riot one to put in our pockets . It is a sublime position on the part of your husband , and I am honored to share it as long as we can afford @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , much as I hated to do it , I urged Mr. Wilson to close the office and partnership , leaving Mr. Colby free to make a living . As always , he was quick to respond and filled with regret that , instead of helping as he had hoped , he had been a drag on Mr. Colby , who had so gallantly kept the doors open and bowed to the inevitable . The partnership was dissolved and nothing left to mark its existence save a beautiful closed electric car which my dear husband had bought with the one legal fee ho had received , and which he presented to me on my birthday . In other years I had always had an electric , but after going to the White House had given it up . There was never anyone who loved personal privacy more than did Woodrow Wilson . Even the presence of a chauffeur was an intrusion , and lie reveled in this ear in which we could go alone . Speed never an object , wo would wind our leisurely way through the park , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandria . Eut , on account of his lameness , I always feared to go too far afield , lest the current should give out . As we turned from the driveway on our first ride , I saw a small rusty horseshoe , which I picked up . To this day it reposes where my husband put it on one of the side lights in my bedroom . Toward the end of October , 1921 , we received the following invitation : The Secretary of War extends an invitation to you to be present at the ceremony attending the burial of the Unknown Soldier at Arlington on Friday , November eleventh , at eleven o'clock . My husband asked Randolph to go personally to the War Department and explain that Mr. Wilson wished to pay his respects to the dead by appearing in the procession , but , due to his disability , he could take no part in the service at Arlington . He also wished to drive in an open carriage in place of a motor . On October thirty-first my brother received the following letter from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wilson , riding in a carriage , arrive opposite the main east entrance to the Capitol at 8:25 A.m. , where an officer will guide his carriage to the place appointed . In the procession his carriage shall immediately precede the Associate Justices of the Supreme Court . When the procession reaches West Executive Avenue the President , Vies President , Members of Cabinet , and so on , will turn left and leave the procession , proceeding afterward by motor via the Highway Bridge to Arlington . It is planned that Mr. ' Wilson shall eonfurm to this movement and leave the procession at the same point . Signed ) War , LASSITER , To this my brother replied : I have laid before Mr. Wilson the contents of your letter of this date . tie asks me to say he will be in the place designated by you on Armistice Day as near 8:25 possible . That it is his wish to accompany the body of the Unknown Soldier all the way to Arlington and not drop out of the procession at Executive Avenue , as you suggest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : I have communicated to the Secretary of War the contents of your note . . . . The Secretary directs me to say that the President and other dignitaries of the Government will retire from the procession at West Executive Avenue and . Ito is therefore constrained to ask that Mr. Wilson conform to the plans arranged . At this we were amazed , but Mr. Wilson accepted in silence the dictum of the War Department . Salute to the " Known Soldier " Though it was an effort for an invalid to make so early a start , we were at the appointed place on time . The officer who was to meet us was nowhere to be found . The crowds were enormous and the police had received no instructions . When the procession began to form , a police sergeant conducted us forward . Here , again , no parade official could be found to takel an interest in our plight . The place immediately preceding the Associate Justices was filled . The procession began to move and , rather than be left out , we wedged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crashing the gate , as my brother Randolph would say . But " well that ends well . " His obscure position in the parade served to emphasize the reception the people gave their wartime chief . Breaking barriers , the crowds poured into the-street . American Legion men formed art impromptu guard about the carriage , whose progress , despite their efforts , many times was almost stopped ( Continued from Pogo 77 ) by the press of humanity . We continued in the procession to West Executive Avenue , where we were " retired " as per request . Returning to the house , we had an agreeable surplice . Thousands of persons were gathered in 5 Street to cheer the " Known Soldier , " as one writer put it . la February , Mrs. Asquith arrived in Washington . I saw no opportunity of adding anything to her already crowded program and decided to leave a card at the British embassy and let it go at that . But , as usual with this lady , she made her own contacts . The White House called up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if and when she could call on Mr. Wilson , As Mr. and Mrs , Hugh C. Wallace were calling that afternoon . I said that we would be pleased to see Mrs. Asquith at . the same time . Then I felt I must go before she came and leave my card . As she was lunching at the White House , I thought I could do this and be back home in time to greet her . But again the energetic lady was before me ; although I was gone only about twenty minutes , I returned to find my shy bachelor brother , Randolph , standing in the hall with Mrs. Asquith 's arms around his waist and her thin face almost against his as she reeled off her indignation that anyone could suppose she would visit Washington and not come to see " the great War President . " When I escorted her upstairs , she rushed forward and knelt beside my husband . I left her pouring out the story she had overwhelmed Randolph with , while I went to greet the Wallaces . I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surprised to find this amazing small lady still on her knees by my husband , laughing and gesticulating . Presently she had to rush oft for another appointment , and as Randolph and I escorted her to the door , she paused before a mirror and asked if we did not think her gown very chic . Then , to my brother 's embarrassment , she released one snapper on the side and threw the whole dress wide open , revealing very lovely French lingerie . " You see , " she said , " how easily I can rid myself of it when I come in tired . Zip ! It 's off ! " I did sincerely like the costume , including its then novel mechanical features . You may be sure that Mrs. Asquith 's visit provided a subject for family conversation . My husband listened to these reminiscences , and then said , with a sly smile : " Well , of course , I think her a person of taste ; for she told me I was the best speaker she had ever heard . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out Mr. Wilson on public affairs . What was , at the moment , regarded as just another such request came in a letter in April , 1922 , from Mr. Tumulty . Ho wrote that the National Democratic Club of New York was giving its Jefferson banquet . Would Mr. Wilson send a message , taking the form of an acknowledgment of an invitation and expression of regret that he could not attend ? My husband replied , thanking Mr. Tumulty and saying : " I feel that a message . ? . would be quite meaningless unless I . made it a serious ex-pression of my views and feelings about the national situation , and I do not feel the occasion is an especially appropriate one for breaking my silence . " Next morning Mr. Tumulty telephoned me . " Mrs. Wilson , " said he , " ca n't you get the Governor to send a letter to this dinner in New York ? " My reply was : " Why , Mr. Tumulty , he answered your letter yesterday . Have n't you got it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , yes , I got it , but I think it very important he should write the letter ; and wo n't you persuade him to do it ? " " No , Mx . Tumulty , " said I , " you know him well enough to know that when he has thought . a thing out and decided it , there is no use to continue useless argument ; and besides , I thoroughly agree with him . " Then Mr. Tumulty said : " Well , there is an important personal matter I would like to discuss with him , and could you arrange for me to see him this afternoon ? " News From New York Mr. Tumulty arrived a few moments before Mr. Wilson got downstairs , and stopped in the office to chat with my brother Randolph . My brother later repeated the substance of their conversation . " Did Mrs. Wilson get the Governor to write out that message to the dinner ? " Mr. Tumulty had asked . Randolph replied : " No , I do n't think she said anything to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the telephone this morning ; and if I may make a suggestion , Mr. Tumulty , when you go upstairs , I would not bring the matter up again , because Mr. Wilson is n't very well today and , as you know , it always tires him to go over the same ground twice . " Mr. Tumulty then replied , in the same fretted tone he had used to me in the morning : " I have no idea of bringing it up . " I left the house on an errand . When I returned , in about half an hour , I found that Mr. Tumulty had gone . My brother having told me of Mr. Tumulty 's conversation , I said to Woodrow : " Well , I hope that Mr. Tumulty did n't again annoy you with a request for a message to the dinner " ; and he said , " No , I am glad to say he had the good taste not to mention it . " As we took our ride Mr. Wilson went on to tell something of his conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about American ideals , with some allusion to the hope that was in the hearts of both of them that America might yet lead the ' way to the salvation of the world . On Monday morning , April tenth , when wo came down to breakfast , the Baltimore Sun was , as usual , on the table . Before he could seat himself , a headline saying something about Mr. Wilson having endorsed Governor Cox for the Democratic nomination met Mr. Wilson 's eye . My husband was thunderstruck . Reading the article , he learned that a message had been read at the Jefferson banquet , purporting to be from Mr. Wilson and construed as an endorsement of Mr. Cox . The Sun had obtained its information from The New York Times . My husband asked if I would mind calling Randolph , and Mr. Wilson asked him to write Mr. Louis Wiley , of the Times . Mr. Wilson dictated a brief note saying any message read at the dinner purporting to come from him was " an absolute fabrication , " and asking Mr. Wiley if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husband was that the purported message should have been construed as an THE SATURDRY EVENING POST February 25,1939 endorsement of Mr. Cox , who was present at the dinner . My husband had the kindliest personal feelings toward the governor , who was such a loyal friend of the League of Nations . But Cox had been beaten in 1920 , and my husband thought the party should have a now leader in ' 24 . He said it was that way with losing baseball and football teams at Princeton . A new captain was one of the essentials for a victorious team the following year . Entering my husband 's room a little later , I found him shaving . " It has just occurred to me , " he said , putting down his brush , " that Tumult ) , was at that dinner . Would you mind taking down a letter to him , because he can find out just what I wish to know about that purported message from me ? " Picking up a pad , I wrote , at Mr. Wilson 's dictation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tumuliy : I am deeply distressed to find in all the papers that contain an account of the dinner in New York last Saturday night a statement that a telegram was read that was said to be from me . This is particularly annoying to me because I understand that the dinner was interpreted as a boom for the renomination of Cox , whose renomination would in my judgment be an act of deliberate suicide . I shall do everything that I honorably can to prevent it . Since you were present at the dinner , it is possilde that you may have had some means of judging , or may have been able to guess , what the real source of the alleged message is . If you are able to throw any light on the matter for me , I would bo very grateful . It is obviously my duty as well as my privilege to probe the incident to the bottom . In haste , Affectionately yours , WOODROW WILSON . The next afternoon Mr. Tumulty 's secretary telephoned to say that Mr. Tumulty was returning to Washington @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine o'clock that night . " Why , there is no urgency about this , Mr. Johnson , " I replied . " The doctors think it is better Mr. Wilson see no one at night , but Mr. Tumulty can come in any time tomorrow  --  even as early as eight o'clock in the morning . " Still Mr. Johnson insisted , and I said that Mr. Wilson was asleep and that I deemed it wiser for my husband not to be disturbed at night . In about five minutes , Mr. Johnson called again to say that Mr. Tumulty was taking an early train from New York . When Mr. Wilson awoke , I told him of Mr. Johnson 's messages and asked if I should call him buck . " Oh , no , " he said . " Tumulty will get in touch with me tomorrow , and there is no such desperate hum- about it , after all . " Back of the Headlines As my sister Bertha was ill , that night , after Mr. Wilson retired , Randolph and I went to see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time when my brother Wilmer arrived and motioned me into another room , where he said : " I have just come from Mr. Tumulty 's office , and you never saw anybody in such a distraught state in your life . He asked me to see if you could help him . " " What about ? " I asked in surprise . Wilmer said : " That telegram Mr. Wilson is supposed to have sent to that dinner in New York . Tumulty tells me it was written by him , He says he was so convinced that Mr. Wilson ought to send a telegram , that , after seeing him on Friday , he thought there could be no harm . So he wrote it out and handed it to the press , and they ' stupidly published it as coming from Mr. Wilson as a message . ' " Now this was a surprise . Wilmer went on : " I got a telegram from Tumulty this afternoon , asking me to meet him at the train . There I found a big group of newspapermen , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tried to ward them off by saying he must go with me at once and would see them later . Then he begged that I take him immediately in my car to your house . This I did , asking on the way , ' What in the world is it all about ? ' Tumulty then told me he had urged Mr. Wilson to write a letter endorsing Cox for the nomination . The request was declined , but , thinking he was acting for Mr. Wilson 's best interest , Tumulty wrote out what he thought Mr. Wilson should have said , and had a lady read it at the dinner . So Tumulty is in this position : Either he has to admit that he faked the message  --  for The New York Times is insisting on an explanation  --  or get Mr. Wilson to assume the responsibility . ' When Tumulty and I reached your house , " continued Wilmer , " and they said you were here , he begged me to go to you with this message : ' For God 's sake help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ published , it will ruin him and disgrace his wife and little children . " No Message Wilmer delivered this message with genuine feeling , for he was sorry for Mr. Tumulty . I thought for a moment , and asked : " What does he want me to do about it ? " Wilmer said : " He wants you to ask Mr. Wilson to permit him to tell the reporters that Mr. Wilson did send the message , but not in just the form in which it was delivered  --  something like that , which would let Tumulty out . " Returning home , I took the rare liberty of awakening my husband . I told him of Tumulty 's plight as Wilmer had pictured it to me , putting in all the " sob stuff " ? as Tumulty himself styled emotional displays in other peopletbe disgrace to his wife and little children , and so on . " Get Wilmer , please , to come up here . " my husband said . My brother reiterated all I had said , after which my husbarid replied : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could not do what he asks ; that ho is entirely mistaken about its ruining him , or disgracing his wife and children ; that it is too small a matter to attract the attention of the public unless he himself dramatizes it , which he seems to be trying to do ; and that if he were my own son , I would act the same way . It is not the first time he has done things like this , and now it is better for him to take his medicine . It will all blow over in a few days . " " Well. , sir , " said Wilmer , " Tumulty ca n't see it that way , and I hate to carry such a message . " " Never mind , " my husband answered . " Go and tell him just what I say . I know Tumulty . Ho is like a child , and will soon react , " Wilmer came back later , as I had suggested , to tell me the result . He said when be gave Tumulty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " My God , then I must do something to save myself ! " As Wilmer took his departure , Tumulty thanked him , saying he would ( Continued on Page 821 never forget his kindness or that of his sister  --  meaning me . Next morning the papers carried a statement from Mr. Tumulty to the effect that " the message read at the banquet came merely in a casual conversation with me at Mr. Wilson 's home . . . He sent no telegram . He simply gave a casual message to me in a casual manner . " The repeated use of the word " message " left Mr. Wilson under the implication of having used Mr. Tumulty to send tip a sort of trial balloon which he now undertook to disavow . Having read Mr. Tumulty 's words , my husband addressed the following let ter to The New York Times under date of April twelfth : I notice in the issue of the Times this morning an article headed Dover IS CAST ' IN WILSON 'S ' MESSAGE ' TO THE COX DINNEn . I write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did not send any message whatever to that dinner nor authorize anyone to convey a message . Mr. Wilson received two lengthy and remarkable letters from Mr. Tumulty , dated April twelfth and thirteenth , before this was published . With a wealth of detail , Mr. Tumulty recalled his visit to Mr. Wilson on the Friday preceding the dinner . Quite accurately , so Mr. Wilson told me , Mr. Tumulty repeated the substance of some of their conversation . Then he went on to say that he left the house certain that Mr. Wilson intended the gist of this as a message to the dinner . The fact is that , having previously declined to send a message to the dinner , Mr. Wilson , in the account he gave me of that talk , complimented Tumulty on his good taste in not bringing the subject up again during their conversation . Thus do men see things as they wish to see them . I should not , at this late date , mention the existence of those two letters , had not Mr. Tumulty given them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
