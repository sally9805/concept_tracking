At the turn of the last century , France had as anticlerical a Government as ever hated &; feared the Pope . French lawmakers bundled up their prejudices in a Laic Law which , among other things , required State authorization for religious orders . When France went to war in 1914 , thousands of members of secret , mufti-wearing orders emerged from their bolt-holes to serve la patrie . The number of aumniers ( chaplains ) in the French forces was limited-400 in the army , 50 in the navy , none in the air force . Most priests were assigned to noncombatant duties . A few had anticlerical officers who forced them to fight . A few more fathers showed a taste for fighting and fought bravely . So grateful was the Government that the Laic Law was thereafter suspended , and an attempt by Edouard Herriot to revive it failed in 1924 . <P> Beford World War II broke , the number of army aum ? niers was increased to 600 . The navy quota remained the same ; the air force got 30 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Catholic aum ? niers , is Monsignor Maurice Sudour , Archdeacon of St. Denis , who gets a general 's pay , wears a general 's star . Ordinary chaplains have no rank , but a captain 's pay , wear religious garb behind the lines , khaki at the front . By special dispensation from Rome , all Catholic aum ? niers and other front-line priests may hear confession , give extreme unction , sing mass at portable altars , at any time under any conditions . <P> A monument in the Vosges marks the spot where , in 1914 , Grand Rabbi Abraham Bloch was killed while bringing a cross to a dying French officer . Last week Grand Rabbi Maurice Liber , peacetime head of Paris ' rabbinical school , now aumnier general for the army 's Jews , combed France for Jewish chaplains . Entitled to 48 , he could find only 26 . The total enrollment of the rabbinical school-twelve youths-was mobilized in the army , but proved insufficiently trained to serve as aum ? niers . <P> Protestant aumnier gnral is France 's most famed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , under whose leadership 1,000,000 French Protestants , representing all the big churches save the Lutheran ( in Alsace ) and the Baptist , were reunited last year after a century of schism . Half of Gnral Boegner 's 1,000 pastors have been mobilized , and 75 installed as chaplains . For French Protestantism , mobilization posed a problem : how to keep its churches running . M. Boegner solved it by recalling aged ministers from retirement , giving pulpit work to laymen and even to " some young ladies who have made profound studies in theology . " <P> Of France 's 50,000 Catholic " regular " priests ( in religious orders ) , 8,000 were mobilized last week . Leading in numbers were Jesuits , Christian Brothers and the peaceable Franciscans . Typical fighting fathers : Franciscan Aviation Captain Boigerolles ; Pere Godefroy of the White Fathers , second lieutenant in the Senegalese sharpshooters ; Jesuit Father Carre , in the tank corps.
