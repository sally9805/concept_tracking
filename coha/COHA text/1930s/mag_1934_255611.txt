They knew that their big banking brothers were patching up peace with the White House but the rank &; filers stepped off the train fairly smoking with hatred for the New Deal and all its ways . Four thousand strong , from the four corners of the land , they had gone to Washington to learn their fate from the lips of the President himself . <P> Most of them were bitterly resentful . They had never forgiven the President for branding them as " money changers " at his inaugural , for continuing to take sharp digs at them ever since . Only a few weeks before in a radio talk he had gone out of his way to give them another ugly poke , by comparing them unfavorably with the bankers of Old England . His lieutenants had badgered and ridiculed them for a year and a half . The vast majority wanted not peace but war . By the time the last delegate had registered last week there was not a doubt but what the 60th annual convention of the American Bankers Association was marked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seldom a stirring spectacle .

The protocol had been arranged in frequent visits to the White House , and the official ratification would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Therefore it was clearly up to the top-notch bankers to maintain order in the ranks until the President had spoken . No martinets , they failed . Outgoing President Francis Marion Law of the ABA might keynote about co-operation between the Government and the bankers but the delegates showed an alarming tendency to stand up and cheer for any speaker who damned the New Deal . <P> From the Democratic South appeared the head of Winston-Salem 's Wachovia Bank &; Trust , Robert M. Hanes of the rich and prolific North Carolina Haneses , drawling : " I admit frankly , that I am quite too stupid to understand the economic theories which are being expounded here at Washington . " And the listening bankers howled with delight when he quoted Rhymster Ogden Nash : <P> The more you earn , <P> The less you keep , <P> And now I lay me down to sleep . <P> Voicing another banking fear , Editor Clinton B. Axford of the American Banker declared : " The national question today is whether we will solve the question of re-employment of our surplus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
