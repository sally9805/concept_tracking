FINALLY HARRIET A STORY BY IRA WOLFERT O N THE last afternoon of his life , a warm , cloudless spring day in which the sky was high , Tom sat on a beach with his wife , Harriet , and a friend , Dick . Tom was a chunk of a man , squat , dark , hairy , in a wrinkled and faded bathing suit . He sat with arms flung loosely into his lap and legs stretched out flat against the sand , eyes staring and face empty while the sea ran up the beach with a crash and seethe . Dick also was dark and muscular , but he was tall . His body jutted sheer as a cliffside from his bathing trunks . His long graceful legs were curled under him as he sat facing Harriet and talking to her indolently . Harriet was in a fresh new print dress and wore a tweed jacket over it against the slow bite of the windless day . Her face was pale and alert . Her dark eyes slanted furtively toward her husband while her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Dick was new to her  --  someone who had come round the bend of the beach into their solitude at the moment when their solitude was becoming intolerable . After an evening and morning of it she had decided to ignore Tom 's sullen apathy and simply be alone as she sat beside him in silence . But she was coming to the end of resignation when Dick happened along ; when she saw , walking slowly at the edge of the sea , a tall , dark , rather handsome male . A look of surprised recognition had come into Dick 's eyes when he had seen Tom . Then Harriet noticed that as he walked along he looked at her carefully as if he were making up his mind whether it was worth while now to take advantage of his recognition of Tom . Eventually he seemed to decide that it was . " Well , fancy that ! " she thought derisively as he came swelling toward them . But just the same she was pleased and a little excited . So now they sat together  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little more than forty , the eldest of the three , brooding vacantly ; his pale , alert wife , a small woman in her middle thirties with a white face and interesting , irregular features that made her Took clever and kind ; Dick , who was somebody Tom had known in the solid , impressive days of the ' 20s . Solid ! Impressive ! In those days , thought Tom , he would , as the office manager , have forced himself to be kind to such a man ; but yesterday the office manager had forced himself to be kind to Tom . " Well you see . . . " and stammering , and " after all we have to .. . " and a long and uncomfortable speech about the new recession . Yes , on the calendar it was 1938 , but it might just as well be 1930 . Only it was worse now . People did n't have the fat on them they had had in 1930 . The shock was greater . Nerves , bolshevism . " After all every business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " thought Tom , sitting alert and trying to keep all expression from his pale face . This had been his FINALLY second job in five years . For the second time he had managed to get free of relief . " Yes , " said the office manager , " people had thought the end of the last depression was a peace , but it was only an armistice and now the war is on again . " " Fire when you see the whites of my eyesl " thought Tont . The manager shifted his paper cuffs nervously and Tom thought , " I remember how I used to feel about the kind of fellow you are . No vision . Fifty dollars a week and a twenty-by-a-hundred house in Floral Park with water coming into the cellar every time it rains . No push . Spend your life plodding timidly along the same old rut . . . . God Almighty , let me find a rut to spend my life in I " " Last one hired , you know , " said the office manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the nervous weak face in front of him , a hunger for the old days when he had been lord of such men and they would thrill if he called them by their first names . But those old days had been in a different world . That was the world in which , when you reached forty-five , you would have the mortgage on the house paid off and , when you were fifty-five , your annuity would start paying you off and you would go round the world . You would be one of those white-haired men with red cheeks staying in Florida for the winter and having a little place in the mountains near fishing for the summer . Your children would be grown up and would come to visit you and tell you their troubles and you would solve them . That was a world whose fabric did not change . You worked and you had fun while you worked . When you bought some extra fun for yourself you felt you had earned it , and the price came out of money you could spare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nothing elaborate . Life had n't ever been elaborate , but you could take a dollar 's worth of taxi when you were tired and it was raining ; and you could have fun when Harriet paid fifteen dollars for a pair of shoes . " You 're sending me to the poorhouse , " you could say . But at length Harriet began to get worried about being childless . " We ca n't go on in a vacuum like this , drying up like this , " she said . " I 'm thirty-five . " When she said that Tom would look at her and try to get an expression of suffering into his face . That was something the depression had taught him . He knew now how to whine for sympathy with his face , even while he was thinking , " If only not being able to afford children was all I had to worry about ! " But there were times when he did not think of what expression he had on his face . Sometimes when she 'd say that he 'd look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's right . They let a man live all right and then they rob him of his life . " First his job , then his money , then his car , then his friends , his annuity , his insurance , his house . The flesh of his life had been ripped from him strip by strip and year by year in a new kind of terrible inquisition . Now the sight of the little mechanical rabbit of a man before him stirred his digust . " You 're firing me , are n't you ? " Tom demanded loudly . " Is that what you 're trying to tell me ? " " It 's not my fault , " said the office manager . " We have to cut down . " " Then say it like a human being , " said Tom . " If you got to stick a knife in , stick it in . " " Okay , " said the office manager , " here it is . " He handed over a slip of paper . " You can take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's pay . We do n't want simply to throw you out flat ? " That 's nice , " said Tom . " That 's a great thing . " The telephone rang , but he did not notice the interruption . He looked at the slip of paper . " This is my death sentence , " he said aloud nervously . He had n't thought of losing a job as being that , but it suddenly seemed true . What else could a man like himself do when he was robbed of life but die ? He needed , if not success , at least hope . He could not resign himself to a lifetime on relief . " This is my death sentence , " he repeated and looked up frightened at the office manager who was talking into the telephone ? " yes , sir , certainly , sir , right away , sir . " Tom waited tensely . He felt panic rising in him . " Listen , " he said , when the office manager hung up , " you got kids in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a tough break for them , but they 've got morale . I been on relief . Listen . " He stopped and struggled to find words . His face seemed to be quaking . The office manager , embarrassed , began to busy himself with the papers on his desk . " In those days I waited around the house all day long , " Tom said . " It 's like lying in your own coffin . I ca n't go through that again . I 'll be goddamned if I 'll do that any more . " " They say things may pick up in the fall , " said the office manager . " In the fall ! " said Tom . " I been through this hell before . I 'm all shot . I ca n't fight any more . 1 got nothing left to fight with . " The office manager thought Tom was going to cry . He stood up nervously . " You leave us your address , " he said . " and notify us of any change . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's a promise , and you can count on it . " Tom looked up at him . He still felt as if he were about to fly to pieces and a single part of him were struggling to hold the rest together . " Say , I got as much chance getting back here as ... do n't think I do n't know about such things from your angle , from higher up too . I used to have two secretaries . I sold a **32;505;TOOLONG contract to Samson-Evans once nobody thought could be got . Do you know Dave Evans ? " " I 've got something I 've got to do right away , " said the office manager , " for Mr. Donald . " " After the contract was signed , " said Tom , " Dave says to me , ' Tom , you done me a barrel of bucks ' worth of dirt to-day . ' Like that . So I says , ' Well , see you get enough dirt for your money . ' I usedto go out to his house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hopelessness welled up in him and smothered his thoughts . " Aaah nuts , " he said . " If I hear of anything around , " said the office manager . Tom stood up . " Will you tell me something ? " he said . " I 've got to know . I handled the job all right ? That is n't what licked me here , was it ? " " Oh , no , " said the office manager . He did not look at Tom . " Your work was fine , and any time you want a reference you tell them to call me up . " He smiled brightly . " Well , good-by , Mr. Murray , " he said . " Good luck . Drop around once in a while and let me know how you 're making out . " Tom shook the outstretched hand . He clung to it as if it were a support . " Why do n't he say it ? " he thought . He was suddenly desperate to hear he was being discharged for incompetence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say it ? " he thought . " I 'm shellshocked . I ca n't hold a job any more . Let him say it . " It would settle everything . He would have no more doubts and no decision to make . The decision would have been made for him . He noticed he was still holding the man 's hand . It felt solid and helpful . " Let go of him , " Tom told himself but he was too terrified . He began to tremble and he felt the trembling go down the length of his hand . Finally , the office manager began to tug his hand away , slowly and uncomfortably . Even then Tom held on . Suddenly the moment of terror was over and Tom was walking out of the office . His legs did n't seem to be under him . He walked as if his body were running after his legs . Tom went straight to the cashier , holding the order for thirty dollars in one hand . The thought returned to him : " This is my death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized the idea had been with him many years , held down , ready to leap upon him . Now he was exhausted . He let the thought range over him . " If 1 only could find somebody , " he whimpered to himself , " to play with me for a while and nurse me along until I got my morale back . The way I am now , 1 could n't hold a night watchman 's job . I 'm through , that 's all . It 's tough enough to find a job without finding a nurse to go with it . I 'm washed up . What 's the use looking for a job ? I 'm yesterday 's newspaper . " He thought of Harriet . " That 's so dead , " he said to himself with such violence his face jerked into a snarl , " it stinks . " His thoughts became an unintelligible glare in his head . After a while he grew calmer and ideas began to emerge . " She 's married to yesterday 's newspaper all right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . You ca n't fool her . No , they wo n't let you fool her . They fixed it up . Clean sweep . Robbed of everything . Take her too . I do n't care what she is , she ca n't go on loving a case of shellshock that 's around all day long nagging at her and weighing her down . No , they 've got her where they 've got everything I ever had , tucked away nice and gone , good-by forever . " The first time he had found a job after being on relief there had been , between moments of terrible anxiety , a feeling of thick sweetness in his brain . He had thought , " l 'll win it all back . Just wait and see . I 'll start with her like I started fifteen years ago , with her and ten fingers on my hands . First the insurance . Then money in the bank . Going out somewhere in the evening . Friends , a car , a house , parties . I 'll get it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wife . " After the second time on relief , when he found a job there had been no sweetness . Fear was too strong . He had thought only . " Can I hold it ? " and the thought would leave him in a sweat . " Let it be a rut , " he whispered sometimes ; " please only let this job be a rut that I can live in the rest of my life . " He was standing before the cashier 's cage , picking up the money . " That 's right , fives and ones , " he told the cash-ier mechanically . As he walked away he thought , " They got it all , and now they can have the body . " He wondered whether to go home at all . He could n't tell Harriet he had been fired . It would be better just to step off in front of a subway train . " Serve the bastards right to have that kind of a mess on their hands , " he thought . But going that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wanted to see Harriet once more . To-day was Friday . She need n't suspect a thing until it was time to go to work Monday . " Until then , " he thought , " we 're okay , are n't we , honey ? Yes , Monday is the deadline all right . Monday you kiss me good-by . . . . ' She kissed me good-by with a rolling pin . ' " He felt like giggling . " You 're getting hysterical , " he told himself . " Get a hold of yourself . " It was only fair to her to do it before she picked up and left him . If he killed himself after she left she would blame herself for it . " It 's got nothing to do with you , Harriet . " He said it aloud in the street , patiently , kindly , his face screwed up with earnestness . A woman going by looked at him frightened . He did not see her , but his next words to himself were uttered soundlessly . " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left for me to go on with . " Yes , end it ! They had got the meat . Give them the skin . Throw it in their faces . Smack the sucked-out pulp in their fat faces . When he arrived home he hung up his coat in the dark hall as he always did before going into the kitchen to find Harriet . He reached for his hat to put it on the shelf . His hand touched the hot , dry , hard flesh of his forehead . A shock went through him . He did n't have his hat . He had left it in the office . He had gone straight out from the cashier 's cage without saying good-by or finishing tip his work or cleaning out his desk . He put his hand on the top of his head to make sure . He felt the damp , rank mass of his dark , graying hair . He had walked through the streets like that without knowing it ! " It 's true then , " he thought with awe . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " called Harriet from the kitchen , " is that you ? " " Yes , " he said . His voice sounded thin but quiet . It was a sick man 's exhausted , tranquil voice . She came from the kitchen to the far end of the hall . " You 're home early , " she said . There was concern in her voice . He felt it . The terror in it hit against him . He watched her standing there in her white apron , her wet hands held up so that they should not drip . She had not even stopped to dry her hands . She stood as if braced for bad news . " I finished up early , " he said . " Oh , darling ! I 'm so glad . " She came toward him . " There was n't anything more to do that could be finished to-night , " he said , " so they told me to just go and have myself a long week-end . " She pulled him to her with her elbows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kissed him . Her flesh was dry and hot too . A fever had swept up in her and burned the perspiration dry . " That 's a pretty civilized outfit you work for , mister , " she said gaily . He felt so sorry for her . To live like that , he thought , on the edge of terror , all the time on the edge of terror ! Just a little something , a little nothing comes along and the terror leaps up . Nobody can go on like that . Nobody can stand it forever . " You bet , " he said and thrust his face against her warm neck . It was wonderful there  --  a nest of soft warmth and in it the feeling of life flowing swiftly and smoothly and quietly on its way . " Oh Harriet , dearest , dearest , " he said to himself . " I 've got something real nice for your dinner , " said Harriet . " You go sit down and watch yourself grow hungry . " On the beach , Saturday afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ softtone that made her words seem cloudy . As Dick listened to her his thoughts ran on ahead of his words . " She knows what you say to her , " he told himself with a feeling of pleasure . She had grown on him swiftly . Tom did n't occupy much of his thinking . At first he had been curious to discover what the depression years had done to Tom , but it was impossible to tell from a bathing suit . Harriet 's dress was new and seemed carefully chosen . Her shoes were scuffed , but so many wore old shoes to the heath . He noticed Tom seemed to have something disagreeable on his mind . Well , let him worry about whatever was worrying him . He had never really known Tom except as a business acquaintance . He was bored by men who took their business troubles along on week-ends and went to bed with them . Harriet was not beautiful , he decided , but she had manner . She seemed so alert and assured . The world appeared to be an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ provocative and responsive . Her voice was so soft and indolent . Her smile was warm and the pallor of her face made her seem even frailer than she was . Warm and frail , provocative and responsive  --  what delicious combinations ! Her nose was marvelously thin . It ran down her face like a line and it was cupped in a round , firm chin . Her chin was tipped with a small ball of flesh and he thought , voluptuously , he knew exactly how it would feel to take the tip of her chin between his thumb and index finger and tug at it . He knew because his mother 's chin had been exactly like that . He shifted closer to her . He leaned forward to shut the sight of Tom from the corner of his eye . Now when she talked he could almost feel her breath brush against his face . " Easy , " he told himself ; " watch your step . " Tom looked the sort who would make trouble . Lawyers and courts and trouble and Harriet sitting crying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fish in the sea . But it was so pleasant to be with her . He would just FINALLY play at it and be near her , and that would make the afternoon go more rapidly , more excitingly . There really did not seem to be much happiness between her and Tom . It did not look as if it would be difficult to get between the two . She seemed ready for something like this . She seemed bored and restless . Nothing serious . But Tom seemed to be the kind who would make it serious . There would be a detective following her . Well , it would be nothing to him . He was accountable to no one , completely detached . But once he started he 'd have to stick to the end . Tears and scenes , bitter stuff , a year or more of it . No . Nip it off now . Nip it off before it started , before he could decide whether she was worth it . " Easy , easy , just watch your step , " he told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a detective and lawyers and tears and shouting . No , it was n't worth it . But she looked as if she knew how Tom would act . Perhaps they were just ready to say " good riddance " to each other . She wouldknow . No . No . She seemed to take things too seriously . Everything seemed to mean a great deal to her . " Well , " said Harriet suddenly , coarsely , " have you had enough of a look at me ? " Dick did n't realize it , but it was a long moment before he answered . " No , " he said seriously . She glanced at him nervously . His preoccupation with Harriet had become so great he did not notice when Tom stood up and began walking toward the sea . But lie followed the frightened flight of her eyes and lie saw Tom advancing with slow , steady steps , his body loose and slumped , in the sea . He did not walk , thought Dick ; he slouched . He was still slouching when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reaction to the water . He simply slouched through it . An uneasiness began to prickle in Dick . He glanced toward Harriet and discovered she was looking uneasily at him . He turned his eyes away hastily . They both watched Tom fling himself awkwardly upon the swelling belly of a wave and , when the wave rolled into flat froth , they could see him swimming steadily , without exultation or even buoyancy . Tom 's head reared up on a rigid neck , like a swimming dog 's . He seemed clumsy in the water , as if he were an animal wallowing . " I hope he does n't go too far , " said Harriet . " He 's doing all right , " Dick told her . " He 's taking it like a good boy taking his medicine . " " What ! " said Harriet sharply . " Oh . Yes , that 's right . " She laughed . " How long have you known him ? " Dick looked into her eyes . Ordinarily he found this embarrassing to do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her eyes and darken their gray color . " Not as long as I know you , " he said quietly . He was startled to hear himself say that . He did n't know what it meant . Yes , he did know , and she knew too , because she did not ask him what he meant . She began briskly to talk of other things . He watched her face . Quick and frail . After a while she said suddenly , " Where is he ? I do n't see him . " Dick turned his head reluctantly to search the restless surface of the sea . He made Tom out at last , still wallowing , low in the water , like some logged hulk lifting and squashing . " He must be trying for that raft , " said Harriet . " He ca n't swim that far . " " I 'll head him off , " said Dick and lifted himself gracefully and ran down the beach . He ran on the balls of his feet and kept his chest high . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long , thin body slit through it . Then he tossed his hair back , boyishly , and struck out in a crawl . The water was unexpectedly warm and thick . It lifted under him like a blanket and closed round his face . He even felt the burble of the bubbles lie made in passing . He felt too that his performance was good and that he was cutting a figure with dash to it . Was Harriet watching him ? But he would not look round to make sure . He could see Tom off to the left , moving now with a slow , exhausted churning , his face deep in the water , the water foaming and rolling . Then Tom lifted his face and Dick saw it was the color of the water . It was an uncanny gray , fleshless and green-drenched . " Hi , " Dick called . " Where do you think you 're going ? " He waited a moment . The wind slid with a hiss across the sea and the sea crashed and splashed . Did Tom know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slow thrashing of his body did not halt . Dick lifted his head clear of the water and cried out again . He saw Tom open his mouth . To call for help ? He saw the water slop in and slop out like a gray soup over the rim of a shaken plate . He saw the face grimace and a gasp go quaking through Tom 's body . Then the green-drenched face , sleek with water , tossed up suddenly and dipped down , the eyes shut , the mouth open and silent . The water closed over the streaked black mat of hair , over the square neck and bulky shoulders , and the body wallowed aimlessly just below the surface of the sea . Dick lunged toward him , but in a moment Tom was up again , choking . Then his mouth opened slowly and once again the water began slopping in and slopping out . " Close your mouth ! " Dick roared . Tom turned his head . No expression crossed his face when he saw Dick , but he began ponderously to swim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the water . It was not much of a race . Dick was upon him . " Go away , " said Tom , his voice thick and faint . A little wave reared up and slapped softly against Tom 's face , but he did not blink his eyes or shake his head . He looked old . Dick circled to come in on Tom from behind . The raft was nearer than the shore . He 'd worry about getting him tothe shore later . " Take it easy , " he said , " and you 'll be all right . " " Let me alone , " said Tom . " You put up a fight and I 'll let you have it and drag you in by the hair . Now just relax . Let me get you by the back of the head . Go over on your back . " Tom gave up so easily that Dick was surprised . He was bracing himself to plunge on the man and throw an arm round his neck and pull him over when Tom said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't want to scare Harriet like that . " Dick paddled slowly forward . " All right , " he said , " put your hand on my shoulder and we 'll go along like that . " They made slow progress toward the raft . " Easy now , " Dick kept saying as the chunky body lumbered after him . " Doing fine now , " he said . " That 's a boy , " and finally he had him at the raft and was half pushing him on to it . Tom had n't swallowed much water . He leaned over the far side of the raft , away from the sight of Harriet , and retched for a little while . Then he lay flat on his back with an arm flung over his eyes against the sun . What was it in him that had fought like an animal every time he gathered his life together and attempted to bury it below the surface of the sea ? When he opened his mouth under the water it slammed shut . When he opened his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a wall closed in his throat . He could n't swallow . But next time , he thought , it would he different . He would go down and lie flat against the bottom , clinging . Then , when he was all set , he would open his mouth . Let it slam shut after that . It could n't slam fast enough . He 'd have let death in . " Do you think you can stand up now and wave to Harriet ? " asked Dick . Yes , thought Tom almost gleefully , death would be in him then , a weight strangling him . Let his life struggle and thrash . Death would be equal to its strength . lie felt exultation course through him . " Harriet , " said Dick . " Wave to her . Show her you 're all right . She must be half crazy by now . " Tom turned his head away and looked down the brown boards of the raft and across the heavily lifting sea . " You think so ? " he said at last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sea . They had become shapeless sloshings , rising and falling . He could not separate them from the emotions they stirred . They were thoughts , as sea is sea , rising and falling . Occasionally , a feeling of shame went creeping like a wave across the dark body of his thoughts . " I guess so , " he said suddenly . He started to sit up and Dick reached out a hand to him . " Do n't help me , " he said angrily and then he felt stronger . The sharp tone had blown something out of him . He rose uncertainly to his feet . His legs were trembling . At first he could see only the water with sunlight flickering against it . Then he made out the shore , people on it , and finally Harriet . She looked so small . She was standing at the edge of the sea , shading her eyes with her hands , trying urgently to see into the sun . How long had she been standing like that ? A sense of desperation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . He could feel desperation in her immovability and the rigidity of her outward staring , the tense patience with which she sought to see through the sunlight . He lifted his arm and waved slowly . She dropped her hands to her side for a moment and then waved back . She waved energetically . He knew how she did that . She must be standing on tiptoe and waving with her whole body . It was a keen delight to know that . His physical movement and her eager , touching response washed the sense of sin from him . His delight grew strong . " You darling ! " He framed the words silently with his lips and waved again and again . He looked round at Dick as someone to whom he might express his sudden , amazing joy . He saw him sitting quietly , watching hint with an air of amusement . " 1 ' 1I be damned , " Dick kept thinking , " I 'll be damned , " until an uncomfortable feeling began to grow in him that he was dealing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had succeeded in reviving him . The man was jumping up and down on the raft and waving , almost hysterically . Once he laughed very loudly , a single , incoherent snort , and Dick looked toward the beach to see Harriet shaking one tiny fist menacingly , as if to say , " Oh , you just wait till I get hold of you ! " Tom seemed to have forgotten Dick entirely . He dived exultantly into the water and began splashing toward the shore . Dick sat watching for a moment . " I 'll be good and damned , " he thought and slid into the water after Tom . For almost half the way the two men swam together . Tom stopped frequently to float and rest . He lay on his back , cushioned in the water , swelling to the immensity of the sky and feeling again an erratic skipping of emotions through his brain . He had been too hasty , he felt . He had n't thought it out properly . He had misjudged Harriet . Yes , they had everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he had her . Wonderful ! Marvelousl " Because , well , that 's the way I feel and that 's right too , " he argued with himself . " If I have her I am still a person . They have n't got everything . They have n't robbed all of me out of myself . I 'll come back . get on my feet and get it all back , starting with you , you darling Harriet . " " You do n't have to float , " said Dick at last , " just rest a hand on my shoulder and we 'll go along together faster . " He had become bored . " Go on by yourself , " Tom replied . He did n't want to be helped in before Harriet . " I 'm all right now . " Dick looked at him with a slight smile . That was what he wanted to do , go on ahead , get out of the water , get away from this sick and stormy man . " You go ahead , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rest when I get tired . " For a moment Tom watched Dick strike out strongly and gracefully , white water brawling at his heels . Then he began to swim himself , thirty strokes , forty strokes , and when he felt he could not possibly lift his arms once more , he went over on his back gasping . He felt his loneliness then . Dusk was coming on . The restless , blackening water was taking on a chill . What would the dusk have been like if Dick had not happened along ? Would he have seen it from wherever he would be now ? Was there anything beyond  --  or simply nothing ? He had been on the edge of knowing . He suddenly thought it odd that he had not wondered before what things would be like after death . Simply flee , that 's all , no thought of where he was going , just flight from life . Well , why had lie thought of it now ? " Sign of returning health , " he assured himself nervously . He waited a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ creeping slowly through his body . " Yes , yes , " he insisted . " It means I 'm getting normal again . " He turned on his stomach to begin swimming and he saw , far ahead , a white fluttering and the glint of white arms upraised where Dick was . He knew suddenly it had been a mistake to let Dick go on ahead . He needed human companionship out here in this exhausting loneliness . He needed somebody , Dick , anybody . Now there was no human sound to hear , only the sound of restless water with wind whistling softly across it . There was nothing here but salt and wet , splashing , tossing , and emptiness . He was alone here and out of his element , defenseless  --  just as he was alone and out of his element and defenseless on earth . The analogy was so perfect it became crushing . If Dick were here , thought Torn , but no , he had to run off . Got tired . Got bored with spending so much time helping . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop down dead in front of them , they 'll pick you up , but not if it takes too much of their time , not if it interferes with them . Officer , arrest this bum . He 's a nuisance . That 's Dick all right . That 's the whole goddamned world . Nice , very nice , if you interfere with them only a little bit . But after that , after you begin to annoy them , or cost them more than they feel it 's a pleasure to give , or bore them  --  Holy Mother of men help youl He saw that Dick was splashing through low water now and had almost reached Harriet . He could tell by the way she held her head that she was smiling and he could tell by all the things he knew of her from their years together what that smile looked like . He could not see her tired eyes , nor the weariness that lay on her face  --  gray on white , like rain on daylight . He saw only her smile . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not known he had noticed  --  how friendly Dick and Harriet had been on the beach together . He had never seen Harriet grow so friendly before on such short notice . They had talked looking into each other 's eyes . No attention to him . No , he was outside their talk . They had made no attempt to bring him in . He had never seen Harriet do that before , on such short notice , with someone she had just met . He stopped swimming and lifted his head to stare across the sea at his wife . " He 's fine . He 's all right , " called Dick up the beach to Harriet as he walked splashing out of the sea . " He 's got sense enough to float when he 's tired now . He told me to come on ahead and let you know . " She looked at him nervously . " It was very foolish of him to try to make that raft , " she said . Then she looked away . She seemed to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her now . " Well , " he said , " first swim of the year . A fellow is likely to get carried away by excitement , you know , and try too much . But he 's all right now . " She smiled and put her hand on his wet arm . " You were grand , " she said . He felt the nipples on his breast stand out with cold . It gave him a prickling sensation . Suddenly , their hands clasped . It was so spontaneous it was frightening . They looked at each other frightened . It was as if they had wanted to spring into each other 's arms and had been restrained by the thought of how much , actually , separated them . " You 're cold , " she said at last . She put his hand under her arm and hugged it into her warmth . It made it seem as if she were snuggling up to him . " Maybe , " she said , " if you throw this jacket of mine round you ... You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her with an uneasy smile and she dropped his hand . She was staring urgently up at him . There was fear in her face . He looked deep into her , as if he were plunging through her flesh . He did not see anything with his eyes . His brain was fainting with emotion . They were going to be together . . soon now . Her eyes jerked past him to the sea . " Where is Toni ? " she cried . The sea was empty . " Who ? " asked Dick dully . " Where is who ? " He heard her whimper . He saw her begin to run toward the bare sea . WINE PARTY BY BABETTE DEUTSCH A COINS because they shine Remain unspent , The golden-bodied wine Will first content The pure lust of the eye . Enough , if such rich luster pay the sight With interest upon long-vanished light . This pleasure as it pales Seems not so fine As what the glass exhales  --  Breath of the vine . Rare gust , be slow to die ! We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath The ghostly grape laughs jollity at death . The wine , though cool as snow , Being drunk , is fire . The taste transmutes the glow Until desire Puts its long grieving by , Or finds some savor of sweetness in what 's tart . Though wrung , the heart exults , the shuddering heart . The failure of delight That makes us rage , The treachery , the spite Of this fouled age , Wine 's power can defy . The blood bounds in the vein , flesh unsubdued Forgets its pain , the soul forgets its solitude.
