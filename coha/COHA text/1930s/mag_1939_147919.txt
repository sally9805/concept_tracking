The predicament of the Scandinavian States last week was far worse than that of Western Europe 's Great Powers . Well might Germany tremble at the thought of Russia 's controlling the rich iron mines of Sweden . Well might Great Britain fear the establishment of a Red Fleet in Norway 's impregnable fiords . Italy might well look forward to Balkan aggression by a Russia secure in the north . Throughout the world , people whose faith in democracy remained might well blanch at the prospect of a totalitarian attack on the nations where democracy has been most liberally applied . But it was Sweden which owned those coveted mines , and Norway whose coastline was threatened . And it was the leaders of these peoples who , if their governments were snuffed out , would be shot in the back of the head . <P> Early this week Speaker Vin Hakkila of the Finnish Diet broadcast a stirring plea for aid in which he declared that " We believe the civilized world . . . will not leave us to fight alone against an enemy more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the aid of Finland , it would be an invitation : 1 ) to Russia to move in on the north ; 2 ) to Germany to move in on the south . There was always a chance , though slim , that Russia would be satisfied with Finland , and there was an even slimmer chance that with enough unofficial help Finland might hold Russia indefinitely . So , officially , the Scandinavian States did the only thing they felt they could do : nothing . Denmark , which is most vulnerable to a German attack , plumped hard for neutrality . Foreign Ministers Halvdan Koht of Norway and Rickard Sandier of Sweden , meeting with Denmark 's Peter Munch in Oslo , agreed to pass the buck to the League of Nations . But unofficially both Norway and Sweden did all they could for Finland . <P> Sweden , which used to boss the Baltic and lick the Russians pretty regularly until Napoleon persuaded Denmark and Russia to gang up on her in 1808 , joined Finland in mining the Gulf of Bothnia to keep the Red Navy out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men were mobilized , bringing Sweden 's armed forces to 150,000 . The fortress of Boden , at the head of the Gulf of Bothnia , was reinforced with reserves . Here was the greatest Russian threat to Sweden , marked by the steady progress of a Russian column across Finland toward Tornio on the Swedish-Finnish frontier . Some 4,000 Swedes volunteered for the Finnish Army and several hundred of them last week managed to cross the frontier and join up . Even more important were the supplies rushed to Finland by Sweden 's great Bofors armament works , which sent gratis 25 anti-aircraft guns originally ordered by Poland . <P> On the political front Sweden showed signs of toughening her stand against both Germany and Russia . At week 's end Foreign Minister Sandier , whose head has been demanded by both countries because of his " pro-British policies , " still carried his portfolio . All but 50 members walked out of the Chamber of Deputies when a Communist got up to speak . Named active commander in chief of all Sweden 's armed forces was 62-year-old Lieut . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ armies , who announced : " The defense of . . . the Fatherland puts everything else in the background .
