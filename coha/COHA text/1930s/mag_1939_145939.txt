The art of sculpture has no more indefatigable plugger than capable , stately Malvina Hoffman . When she did her famous bronzes of 101 racial types for Chicago 's Field Museum , she performed a sculptural-scientific job of Leonardian scope , proved to countless U. S. citizens that sculpture could be scholarly . In the four years since then , 51-year-old Sculptor Hoffman has done less notable modeling , more writing . In her latest book she offers students and laymen a drilled-eye view of a tough craft . <P> Catholic if somewhat cursory , Miss Hoffman 's chapters on great sculpture are aided by keenly chosen illustrations . Once a worshiping student of Rodin , she speaks with equal understanding of the intense simplifications of Brancusi . But her chief theme is the craft itself . Among other things , she describes in ingratiating detail : the processes of casting in bronze , techniques and mechanisms for making enlargements from a small model , tools , tempers and techniques for working in different types of stone , an orderly scheme for scrubbing a studio . <P> " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideal plan to challenge a young hopeful . . . would be to send him or her to a practical school of technical training ( if one exists ) where the pupils are taught to drive a nail straight , or saw a plank , miter a few corners and plane the surface of rough wood until the hands become used to holding and directing tools . . . . " <P> For 30 years a celebrity sculptor , bushy-whiskered Jo Davidson is known for his studies of presidents , generals , kings and Gertrude Stein . Of late " Headhunter " Davidson 's social types have changed . Dedicated last autumn in Claremore , Okla. was his memorial statue of the late homespun Humorist Will Rogers . Exhibited in Manhattan last November were his portrait busts , made under fire in Spain , of the leaders of the People 's Army . Last week when chunky Sculptor Davidson stepped ashore in Manhattan , glowering amiably , he brought with him from Paris a seven-foot , two-ton bronze statue of Walt Whitman , a People 's Poet if there ever was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Manhattanites who wished to supplement Knoedler 's nudes with something contemporary and three-dimensional could see distinction in both respects at the Buchholz Gallery . The exhibition was of bronzes by Charles Despiau , 65 , a quiet , interminable workman who has gradually taken rank as one of the two or three finest French sculptors . His Assia ( see cut ) , a 35-inch bronze done in 1938 , was the chief work shown . Not ten classic " standing nudes " so esthetically satisfactory have been fashioned since the time of Rodin . <P> On a Park Avenue vacant lot neatly prettied and pedestaled , Manhattan 's lively Sculptors ' Guild turned out to haul , hoist and hope for vernal weather . Occasion : a repeat performance this week of its smash-hit outdoor show ( TIME , April 25 ) . <P> * SCULPTURE INSIDE AND OUT-Norton ( $3.75 ) .
