SUBMARINE : THE AUTOBIOGRAPHY OF SIMON LAKE-As told to Herbert Corey-Appleton-Century ( $3 ) . <P> Simon Lake 's first submarine was a 14-foot , flat-bottomed contraption , built of yellow pine and looking vaguely like a flatiron mounted on wheels . It had a compressed-air reservoir built of an old soda-fountain tank , and motive power for both its propeller and wheels was supplied by a hand-driven crank . When the redheaded , hot-tempered Simon Lake and his cousin Bart paddled it down the Shrewsbury River in New Jersey in 1894 , Bart opened the valves , the submarine sank , a stream of water squirted in through a neglected bolthole and hit him in the back of the neck . By the time they had plugged the hole with a piece of pine , the submarine was resting on the bottom of the river . They cranked it across the Shrewsbury , made it crawl obediently through the mud and , as a demonstration for skeptical townspeople , even made it scoop up old tin cans and clamshells . It was , says Simon Lake , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing for their inventions . <P> Inventor Simon Lake 's autobiography is a sketchy , tantalizing book , evenly divided between good anecdotes about submarine building and dull tirades ' against other submarine builders . Inventor Lake 's anecdotes range wide : the Lake family 's inventive genius ( Father invented a shade-roller , Ira a telephone , Vincent a typewriter and Uncle Jesse and Uncle Ezra an unsuccessful flying machine ) ; experiences in Russia when Simon was selling eleven submarines to the Tsarist Government ; stories about the fabulous immorality of the Russian upper classes . <P> Written with all the ambiguity of a book " told to " someone , Submarine is further weakened by its extravagant claims for the world-shaking importance of Simon Lake 's inventions . It is good reading only when Inventor Lake forgets his grievances and talks cheerfully of mishaps at the bottom of the sea .
