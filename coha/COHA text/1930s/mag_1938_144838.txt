A corporation which TVA evangels never include in their critical remarks about power corporations is the TVA itself . Like RFC , FDIC , Commodity Credit Corp. , TVA is Government corporation in business . In its buying and selling , making contracts , filing suits , its status as an incorporated concern relieves it of much red tape . Last week Dr. Arthur E. Morgan , who used to be top officer of TVA Corp. , reminded his onetime colleagues , Directors Harcourt Morgan and David Lilienthal , that corporations have to take the bad along with the good , as Messrs . Harcourt Morgan and Lilienthal have often reminded the power corporations . <P> At Knoxville , Tenn. , where Senator Vic Donahey 's TVA investigating committee was assembling for an inspection tour , Dr. Morgan took advantage of TVA 's corporate status to file a civil suit against it . He sued in a local chancery court instead of in U. S. District Court , where TVA would prefer to answer his demands for : 1 ) $2,916.66 back salary accrued since the President fired @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) recognition as TVA chairman , on the ground that the President had no authority to discharge him. * <P> The second issue was significant . Whereas the courts have ruled that the President may fire such purely executive functionaries as postmasters in midterm , but may not , except for specific offenses , discharge quasi-judicial , quasi-legislative officers ( I. C. C. , F. T. C. ) who have been appointed for fixed periods . Dr. Morgan was first to raise the question of White House control over the appointed officers of such corporations as TVA . Although Solicitor General Robert H. Jackson has opined that the President has ample power to get rid of Dr. Morgan , that persistently righteous man holds one ace : a section in the TVA act which says a director may be removed by concurrent House and Senate resolution , says nothing about Presidential power to fire . <P> *To some 23 well-wishers who had volunteered contributions to his expenses , embattled Dr. Morgan last week addressed letters saying he could use more money . Said he : " . . . Contributions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or from persons or companies which have personal or private issues with the TVA. "
