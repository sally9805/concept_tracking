txt Earnings of Continental Baking Corp . in the five-week period ended May 17 were running at a rate 50%. in excess of average weekly profit during the first 15 weeks of the year . The improvement is continuing and it is probable that the next report to be issued will show profits close to normal . In the first fifteen weeks of this year ended April 12 net profit was $1,182.976 after all charges and taxes equal after preferred dividends to four cents a share on 291,813 shares of Class A stock outstanding . This compared with $1,836,734 , or $2.18 a share on Class A in the corresponding 1929 period . Current earnings are now running at the same rate as in the first fifteen weeks of 1929 . The sharp decline in profits in the last quarter of last year and the first quarter of current year was due to the combination of a falling off in sales volume due to the general depression and to the break in wheat and tour prices . Sales volume is showing a recovery in the various plants all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be operating on lower-priced raw materials so that the remainder of the year should show normal earnings . Current Ratio 41/2 to 1 Current asset position is satisfactory with a ratio of about to 1 . Cash on hand is over $3,000.000 . The company 's new San Francisco bread bakery which was opened early in February is on a profitable operating basis . Continental Baking still carries among its investments $5,000,000 securities of the Cornmander-Larabee Flour Mills . These mills in common with other flour mills have not been doing well lately but since Continental has never drawn any income from this source , earnings are not affected by this situation in any way . The holdings in the mills are a carryover from the old Ward management . The effect of declining commodity prices on the earnings of the large baking companies is difficult to gauge since the actual figures of tour costs of the big companies in the past have sho on little fluctuation from year to year . This probably is due to ability to buy large amounts on contract at favorable opportunities . However , it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , flour annually may be considerably affected temporarily by even minor price changes . It is , therefore , probable that the sharp break in flour prices last fall did have a considerable effect on profits . The sub- stantially lower prices now prevailing  --  flour roughly 50 cents a barrel cheaper than it was last fall  --  are bound to increase margin of profit . Other important ingredients such as milk , lard , sugar and egg powder also are cheaper . Prices of ingredients , however , play a small part in comparison to the importance of operating and distributing expenses and consequently a falling off in volume of sales may seriously disrupt profits . This falling off in business probably is more responsible for the drop in Continental 's earnings than toe fluctuations in commodities . The present recovery in business is an encouraging omen for the remainder of the year .
