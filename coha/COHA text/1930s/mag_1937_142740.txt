High over the rolling mountains northeast of Burgos , a twin-motored Rightist plane dodged last week through thick patches of fog . It was far from any battle front . A young shepherd on a hillside idly watched it come out of the clouds . Few minutes later he stumbled excitedly into the little village of Briviesca . The plane had crashed into the mountainside. * Help was wanted . <P> Sweating painfully uphill , rescuers soon found the wreckage . All the occupants were dead , two officers , the pilot , and mechanic . Twenty-five yards away they found the mangled body of still another officer , wrapped in a worn tan waterproof coat . Round his waist was a general 's sash . It was some time before he could be identified : General Emilio Mola , second in command only to Generalissimo Francisco Franco . Longlegged , broadnosed General Mola was in his stocking feet , for ever since a gypsy told him that he was to die with his boots on , Rightist officers explained , he alwrays took his shoes off in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rightist chances in mary months . Of all the Rightist generals who have thrown in their chances with Franco , spectacled , bateared Emilio Mola was the one whom officious German and Italian staff officers treated with most respect . <P> Like many another Rightist leader , Emilio Mola , 49 , was not born in Spain . His father was a Spanish officer in Cuba , his mother Cuban . After a mildly distinguished career in the Spanish army he won distinction and his general 's sash fighting Abd-el-Krim in Morocco in 1926 . Just before Alfonso XIII 's flight from Madrid , Emilio Mola was chief of police in Spain , won the title of " the most hated man in Spain " for ordering Civil Guards to fire on the students . No monarchist , he was placed on the retired list in the early years of the republic , was in and out of favor depending on whether the Cabinet was Leftist or Rightist at the time . <P> When the civil war broke last July , Mola was virtually in retirement at Pamplona . One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who was also killed in an accident , flying from Lisbon . Mola was among the first to recognize the leadership of Francisco Franco , who gave him command of practically the entire northern sector of Rightist activity . At the time of his death , Mola was responsible not only for the siege of Bilbao but for the siege of Madrid as well . With no capable successor to hand , Generalissimo Franco split Mola 's command in two . To the Bilbao front went General Jos Fidel Davila , a desk officer who had been head of the " technical junta . " Put in charge of the Madrid , Aragn and Soria fronts was bleary-eyed old General Andres Saliquet , who looks very much like Cartoonist Bruce Bairnsfather 's famed Old Bill . <P> Still in command of the southern armies was hoarse-voiced General Queipo de Llano whose persistent personal broadcasts from Seville have been one of the high spots of the civil war . <P> " Mola is dead , but his spirit will remain . His death can change nothing ! " cried General Queipo de @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ led the funeral march through the streets while Rightist sympathizers scattered rose petals from the balconies and a muted brass band played Sueo Eterno ( Eternal Sleep ) .
