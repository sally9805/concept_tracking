PEOPLE who last winter visited the r southernmost tip of the United States , the island city of Key West , saw something going on which was a summary of current history , and just possibly a preview of the future . Nothing quite like it will ever be seen again , for some of the factors that gave to life in Key West last winter a fourth-dimensional flavor can never recur , even in Key West ; but if the experiment being conducted there works out it may be repeated with variations elsewhere . An entire community had found its occupation gone ? the various occupations by which it had lived for a hundred years . City and county had surrendered their powers , via the Governor , to experts from Washington backed by Federal funds , who were undertaking a job of vocational rehabilitation , teaching a destitute town how to make a living by a new trade . Key West , with the finest winter climate and the finest fishing in the country , had always had some winter visitors ; but it takes a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town , and so long as it was prospering as a seaport , a naval base , a center of the cigar industry , the community never made much effort to attract visitors or to entertain them . Now the government ? the Florida Emergency Relief Administration , nominally a State but actually a Federal agency ? was operating the town as a tourist resort : renting houses and training servants , building beach cabanas , and hiring mural painters to decorate barrooms . But even this somewhat surprising spectacle was less strange , and less stimulating , than the fact that the trained and disinterested intelligence of outsiders had been mobilized and applied to the problems of a community which had proved unable to save itself . So the visitor felt almost as if he were in Pasteur 's laboratory , watching the beginnings of a new scientific technic . The social sciences are pretty largely textbook sciences because it is hard to create laboratory conditions for social experiment . In Key West , a small town on an island miles away from anywhere ? a town which in climate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Florida nor Cuba , neither American nor Caribbean , but simply Key West ? in such a place the laboratory conditions created themselves . In that isolated microcosm you could study the whole issue of disinterested collective planning versus interested private enterprise , with all the factors present on both sides ? including , conspicuously , human nature . It was the New Deal in miniature ? high intentions and bold beginnings , hampered and bedeviled by the need of respecting vested interests and laggard public opinion , by the ease of compromise and the difficulty of cutting Gordian knots ; by the unhappy American tendency to regard a thing announced in the newspapers as a thing done . It was certainly accomplishing something ? something much better than what had been there before , but falling short of the original vision and perhaps of the possibilities . One almost felt that it was all history in miniature , an apologue of the aspirations and the shortcomings of man . That may sound like nonsense ; but it was the effect Key West produced last winter on a visitor who observed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are poor tools to convey the feeling created by the experiment , and the atmosphere of continuous intellectual excitement it engendered in a small town on a remote tropical island , where life had the isolation and surcharged intensity of life on a round-the-world cruise . Only music could express it , and such music as no composer now living is competent to write . Music of the future , a New World symphony ? but a new world corrupted and confused , as new worlds are apt to be , by stubbornly persistent survivals of the old world ; not to mention the flesh and the devil . Perhaps it might sound something like the Grail music from " Lohengrin " and the Valhalla music from the " Ring , " played simultaneously with the " TannMoser " bacchanale ; or perhaps a collaborative composition by Wagner , Stravinsky , and George Gershwin , to a libretto by Paul Morand , Noel Coward , and Edgar Allan Poe . But to go on , and try what may be done with words . II Key West , it must be repeated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not Cuba either ; though of the town 's eleven thousand inhabitants ( there used to be twice as many ) Cubans are the largest single group . You hear as much Spanish as English on the streets ; and the Cubans , lounging about caf ? s , living outdoors as much as possible , serve notice on the visitor that this town is not for people in a hurry . For those who like warmth and ease , who are capable of generating their own excitement and do not have to go out and buy it at a race track or a night club , Key ' West has an irresistible charm ; but such persons are a minority , and most of the tourists who came to Key West in the old days came to fish . You can like Key West and like Miami Beach too , because they are so different ; but most people who must have what they can get at Miami take one look at Key West and go away in disgust . Instead of the ornate near-Spanish architecture of the East Coast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ architectural pretensions at all . The homes of the more prosperous citizens look like the more prosperous homes in any small town anywhere , except for the tropic gardens round them ; and most of the residences in Key West are cigar-makers ' cottages ? simple one-storey cabins weathered to a silver gray , with no chimneys , because you need no heat and cooking is done in the back yard . Not till government architects studied the town last summer was it realized that some of the old residences and business buildings contained magnificent examples of carpentry and ironwork ; not till government artists began to paint Key West scenes was it perceived that the town might become another Provincetown or St. Maio . So long as there was war or danger of war in the Caribbean , Key West was chiefly important as a naval base . It was a great cigarmaking town too , and at one time the busiest port in Florida . The late Henry M. Flagler spent fifty million dollars extending the Florida East Coast Railway down the Keys ; but he did that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ traffic , and mostly because the feat challenged his imagination . With the coming of prohibition the railroad built a first-class hotel , the Casa Marina , at the edge of town , to provide a stopping-off place for people on their way to Havana to get a drink ; but presently it turned out that people could get a drink without going to Havana for it , so the Casa Marina never did a very lively business . It has always had a sort of extra-territorial status in Key West , like the foreign settlements in Chinese ports ; its guests come down to fish , to play golf , or to recover from operations ; they seldom have much to do with the town except as purchasers of rum . A little of the Florida boom of 1925 spilled over on Key West ; but the in-terest of those days was in selling real estate , not in attracting tourists . ( Last winter , when the government attempted to make a park out of one of the downtown blocks , the whole project was halted because the tumbledown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the greatest names in Europe , who stubbornly refused to sell . He had never seen Key West ; but he had bought that corner at the boom price , and he was going to hang on till he got his money back . ) What Key West got out of the boom was the Concha Hotel downtown , small but comfortable ; a couple of new schoolhouses , a boulevard round the island , a motor road down the Keys , and a lot of headaches . For the city borrowed a million and a half to build the boulevard , the county borrowed four million to build the Overseas Highway ; and then the boom blew up . The result was that two long stretches where the road would have had to be carried over deep water had to be covered by ferries , because the county could not raise the eight or ten million dollars that would have been needed to build bridges . Failure to build those bridges was the luckiest thing that ever happened to Key West . If they had been there when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swarms of motor tourists ; and the civic boosters of those days were all set to make the place over into what the ordinary tourist wants ? a small and unconvincing imitation of Miami ? forgetting that Key West always has been and always will be a place for the extraordinary tourist . But the long , slow ferry trip cut the tourist traffic down to a trickle ? and thus provided Key West with a priceless excuse . When hard times came knocking at the door most of the citizens simply sat back and said that everything would be all right if only the State or the Federal government would build their bridges for them . It was a good deal easier than trying to think their way out . The general depression supervened on particular depressions that beset Key West . The cigar factories that once supported ten thousand people had had labor troubles , and moved to Tampa or the North ; Key West sponge fishers were unable to meet the competition of the Greeks of Tarpon Springs ; the collapse of the Cuban sugar boom ended the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made up most of the business of the port . The navy yard and submarine base , and the forts that protected them , lost their relevance when the center of international tension shifted to the Pacific , and were reduced to skeleton maintenance garrisons . Suddenly Key West discovered that most of its industries were gone , and that there was small likelihood of their ever coming back . So ambitious citizens mostly moved away ; those who stayed were either people who had some capital ( though not much income ) and kept hoping that something would turn up , or Cuban cigarmakers who knew no other trade and had small hope of getting jobs in Tampa even if they could afford to move there . Taxes were unpaid , bonds in default ; business buildings stood empty and dilapidated , rubbish accumulated , garbage was collected only once in a while ; with thousands of people half fed , physicians began to be afraid of the outbreak of an epidemic . When I saw the town in March , 1934 , half the population was living on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at a poor dying rate ; and of the jobs they were working at only one , the building of an aquarium , had any civic utility . As for citizens not on relief , they seemed to be living mostly by selling rum to one another . The Casa Marinawas closed ; the Concha had some tourists , but they could only drink rum and enjoy the climate . A town with miles of ocean front and the finest of sea bathing had no bathhouses , no equipped bathing beach . Key West not only was broke but , as one of its eventual rescuers put it , had lapsed into a state of mass melancholia . By May two-thirds of the population were on relief ; whereupon Julius F. Stone , Jr. , Florida Emergency Relief Administrator , who had never seen Key West before , decided to go down there and see what could be done about it . III Stone happened to be one of the people who can appreciate Key West , and he fell in love with the place at sight . People will tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but if he had not fallen in love with it ? and if Governor Dave Shoitz , who served there in the army during the War , had not shared his feeling ? Key West might by this time have been as deserted as one of the ghost towns of the old Western mining country . For one of three things might have been done . Relief ? more adequate relief ? could have been continued until ( if ever ) " prosperity " returned to the nation ; which would have cost half a million dollars a year and left Key West no better off . For the return of prosperity everywhere else would never have brought back the cigar factories or reopened the navy yard . Or ( and this was seriously considered ) Key West might simply be given up as hopeless and relief cut off altogether . That would have solved the problem of the town but not the problem of its inhabitants ; they would have had to migrate ( how , God only knows ) to Miami or Tampa , to be added to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic , especially ' the people of Miami and Tampa . The third possibility was to find Key West a job ; and I believe Stone was absolutely right in deciding that the best chance to make the town self-supporting was to build it up as a tourist resort . That may not take care of the whole population , but it will come nearer doing it than anything else . Stone , who had all Florida to look after , deputed two of his subordinates ? Donald Corley , architect , and Harold Ballou , former university professor and newspaperman ? to study the situation ; and their report was a blueprint of what might have been done in a crisis which was as acute locally as the crisis of March , 1933 was nationally . Observing that the Florida Keys arc hardly more a part of the continental United States than are the Virgin Islands , they recommended the replacement of the cumbrous and costly dualism of city and county governments by a single appointive authority . Since the town was being reorganized like a corporation in bankruptcy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with every citizen a stockholder . Property was recognized ; the former owners would get more stock than the former proletariat ; but the poor would hold senior securities , bonds that would pay enough from the start to support their holders ( provided they were willing to work ) while the rich would receive , at first , a much lower return . That would have been a highly instructive experiment , and Key West would have had to accept it ; it had to accept whatever Stone decided , as the country in March , 1933 had to accept whatever Roosevelt decided . But even Roosevelt , when he might have done anything , chose only to save the immediate situation and let it go at that ; and Stone was not a President . He was a man under authority , responsible both to Governor Sholtz and to Harry Hopkins in Washington ; and it seemed to him that the best that could be done was to try to set up Key West as a tourist town in the hope that private enterprise would be attracted after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be primed with Federal taxpayers ' money , and nobody who had seen how things were run in Key West would have turned that money over to the short-sighted political-economic oligarchy that dominated the local governments . So there were conferences with officials and a mass meeting of citizens ; and in July the news went out that city and county officials had abdicated in favor of the Governor , who had turned the town over to the FERA to be fed , rehabilitated , and governed . That story made the front page all over the country , and no wonder ; it seemed to portend the collapse of local self-government , the administration of any community that found itself in difficulties by prefects sent out from Washington . As a matter of fact , it was found that city and county could not legally abdicate , so Key West is governed by a sort of polite fiction . When the FERA wants something that requires a local ordinance it sends word to the City Hall or the Courthouse , and the statute is passed . Conservatives may shudder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and courthouses in the country that do not take orders from somebody . If the people who give the orders in Key West are out-of-town experts , they are at any rate more intelligent and more disinterested than Tammany Hall or its equivalents in a thousand other cities . Nevertheless , that story made the front page ; it had to make the front page . Since most of Key West was already on relief , living on the taxpayers ' money , it was reasonable enough to spend a little more money , intelligently directed to the end of getting the town off relief , even if that meant putting the government into the tourist business . But you could hardly use taxpayers ' money to advertise one tourist resort at the expense of others , and Key West needed a lot of advertising . Stone and M. E. Gilfond , then his director of publicity and now the active head of the Key West administration , realized that they would have to get their advertising free by making news . They got it with that story and they got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plan . If the government was to spend money on Key West it was only fair for the citizens to meet that contribution . Those who had any money promised to repair their houses , do what they could to make the town more attractive to visitors ; and those who had only work to give promised to give that . Thousands of people on work relief , putting in three days a week at two dollars and forty cents a day , volunteered to work two days a week for nothing as their contribution to the restoration of their city . That was an inspiring gesture and a good news story ; unfortunately , for months it was nothing more . Another branch of the government got the town more publicity . Edward Bruce , director of the Public Works of Art Project , sent two water-colorists down to Key West to see what they could find there ; and encouraged by their discoveries , he sent more artists ? eventually a dozen all told . Some of their paintings were reproduced on post cards ; the government sold fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prepare what was probably the most attractive publicity booklet that any Florida resort ever sent out . Last winter an art gallery was opened in the town , with a very creditable show ; this year you will see Key West pictures in exhibitions all over the country , and there could be no better advertisement of the town , to the only sort of people who are capable of enjoying it . /V The FERA took charge in July ; and carefully avoided the initial mistakes that might have been made , of filling the town with carpetbaggers and wasting money on overhead . Altogether eleven administrators ( plus twelve artists ) came in from outside ; the rest of the office staff , some seventy men and women , was chosen from local residents . The large government plant at the navy yard was almost unused , so the Navy permitted the FERA to use the yard administration building for its offices and to house most of its executives and artists in unoccupied officers ' quarters . Later , it even turned over the empty submarine base for use @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ owns the best bathing beach in town , was less co-operative . ) The first thing to do was to clean up the town ? remove the garbage that imperiled health , the rubbish that befouled the landscape ; to tear down old shacks falling into ruin that were eyesores to the passer-by . Luckily there was plenty of common labor available , and by midwinter Key West was as well manicured a town as you could find anywhere . " The achievements of the Administration , " wrote a possibly somewhat cynical publicity man , " range from the painting of 169 water colors to the demolition of hundreds of unsanitary outhouses . " Not the least of those achievements was the exercise of eminent domain over Big Annie , who had to remove her house of joy from its preferred position downtown , where political influence had long kept her to the scandal of respectable citizens , and go to join the rest of the girls down in the District . The Administration also built some really good bathing beaches , with cabanas that paid for themselves in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restaurants of the town with murals painted by PWA artists . ( Whether that was an improvement or not is open to serious question ; and this without any reflection on the merit of the paintings . ) But the primary problems ? granted that tourists could be attracted ? were how to get them into Key West and where to put them after they got there . The chief obstacle to getting them in was the Florida East Coast Railway . Flagler , building the railroad across the Keys , had displayed private enterprise at its best ; but Flagler was dead and his road was in receivership , and his successors could think of nothing better to do with the Overseas Extension that had been his pride than to run it so badly that maybe they would be allowed to abandon it altogether . With by far the heaviest investment in Key West , the road still stubbornly refused to run more than one train a day into town ; and that one leaves Miami at the unappetizing hour of 7:20 A.M. Service on the motor highway could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ferry gap on a shuttle train ; but the railroad refused to help people get into Key West even if it got paid for carrying them . The Administration had to do what it could by improving the ferry service and by subsidizing an airplane service from Miami , after traveling on which you will never want to ride on the train again . As for housing , the Concha Hotel was small and the Casa Marina was closed . It was not really a part of Key West , but it had to be reopened ; boarded up , it was crepe hung on the door of the town . The railroad re-fused to open it without a government guarantee against operating loss ; so the guarantee was given and turned out to be unnecessary . Another small hotel , the Overseas , was renovated and leased to an operator . But the great surprise was the discovery of so many houses and apartments available for winter rental in a town that had had almost none . Most Key Westers were broke , and were perfectly willing to move @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a little cash . These were not ornate Spanish-style bungalows such as you would rent in Miami ; they were ordinary small-town houses , but good enough in a climate where you can do most of your living outdoors . And rentals last winter were set low ? lower , probably , than they will ever average again ; mostly they ran from thirty-five to fifty dollars a month , with seventy-five , I believe , the absolute top . At those prices , nearly two hundred houses and apartments were rented in a town that had never rented two dozen before . Just how many tourists Key West drew last winter nobody knows ; but the ferries , month after month , brought in three times as many people as in the previous winter ; the Concha , which had had virtually all the tourist traffic previously , had only a small part of it now and still was doing a fiftyper-cent better business ; the Casa Marina , giving far better food and service than in the old days , and at lower prices , was making money ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been rented as in the past ? all this under government operation , where private initiative had conspicuously fallen down . Last winter for the first time in its history Key West drew a crowd . And for possibly the last time in its history , it drew exactly the right crowd ; by some unexplained freak of chance virtually all the permanent winter residents were people who could appreciate not only the town but what was going on there . For the administrative experiment , with its successes and its failures , fomented a continuous intellectual excitement that enveloped the whole town . That was something new in Key West . Other brands of excitement had always flourished luxuriantly in a climate where the delighted Northern visitor finds that he can hold twice as much liquor and get along with half as much sleep as at home ? a climate , said one of the winter residents , which feels as mild as a sidecar cocktail , and has the same calorific and explosive effect . All those native intoxicants were liberally present last winter , but it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together at Pena 's bar or Ramonin 's restaurant the things they debated , hotly and endlessly , were intellectual problems , and problems with a specific local application . You felt that life in a Greek city-state might have been like that ? one of the smaller island cities , Paros perhaps or Naxos ? if there had ever been a Greek city-state where women shared in the politics . It was the administrators who set the tune , of course ? the administrators and the artists , and their families ; not more than fifty people all told , but mostly young and all intellectuals , in the technical sense of the word . They set the tune and the winter residents were able to follow it , with the upper circles of the natives doing their best to chime in . To this general harmony most of the Casa Marina guests were an exception ; they were skeptical or ( more often ) uninterested , and the administrators and the winter residents were inclined to snout them as Babbitts . But on the whole the town was dominated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ excitements ? a small town , remember , where everything that happened or failed to happen was all over the place in half an hour ; where teapot tempests were constantly arising and subsiding ; where at a single bar , between five and seven in the evening ( or between ten thirty A.M. and noon , for that matter ) you would meet everybody you wanted to see and some that you did n't . A town so much like a club that the departing visitor felt that he ought to send back the customary acknowledgments to the president and members for having accorded him the courtesy of a guest card . It was Greenwich Village , Montparnasse , Provincetown ? on a little tropical island . Listening and looking on , I felt alternately that mine eyes had seen the glory of the coming of the Lord , and that I was observing a slightly less cock-eyed replica of the Ford Peace Party . Possibly it affected me that way because I regard Key West against a background of intermittent memories several layers deep , the principal strata dating @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still prevailed and the dominant interest was money . In 1928 the Florida boom had exploded but the stock-market boom was rising toward its peak ; money ran the country , money was what everybody was thinking about ; money had generated its own philosophy and religion which for the moment was the Established Church of the United States . Key West , of course , never attracted ostentatious money ; that preferred Palm Beach or Miami Beach . But all the people you met at the Casa Marina in those days were men of achievement , the only kind of achievement that mattered much ; they had made money and were going to make still more . Choicest flower of the epoch , there was present that winter the great Engineer of Human Happiness , Herbert Hoover himself ; destined , as everybody knew , to be not only the next President , but value to public morale . But nothing was done about it till February ; and then people who had forgotten their promises of last summer were suddenly reminded of them ? by which time , of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' work for three days ' pay . If that program had got started early , the rehabilitation of Key West would have been a really collective enterprise ; now it can not help looking to many people like something imposed by outside authority . A more fundamental criticism is that while Stone 's program is certainly the best way ? perhaps the only way ? to save Key West as a town , it is not going to save all the people . There are those who think that Key West , with its mild summer climate ( every breeze a sea breeze ) could be made an all-year resort except for the hurricane months ; but I do not see why it should get summer tourists from the Cotton States when the mountains and the Gulf Coast are so much nearer . Others hold that the answer is to make the town a free port . Key West has the dubious distinction of being passed by more ships that do not stop than any other seaport in the country ; but I am not sure that so many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ payment of duty . Next summer it will still be possible to keep everybody employed polishing the town up for next winter 's tourists ; but neither that job nor the relief funds that pay for it will last forever . J. Gerry Curtis , the engineer who was largely responsible for the Bay Front Park in Miami , believes that the town might be kept alive between tourist seasons by subsistence gardens and truck farms ; and the Corley-Ballou report went deeply into the possibility of better agriculture on the Keys . The one thing that seems fairly sure is that simply as a winter resort Key West can not support all its people all the year round . Jessie Porter Kirke , who operates a gift shop , has started teaching cottage industries and the making of souvenirs to local women ; which will help , but will by no means do all that is needed . Last winter certainly epitomized the whole New Deal in that the poor got subsistence but it was the comparatively rich who got any real relief ? the people who had such houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the town who at last saw outside cash coming in , property owners who can hope to recoup on sour investments . If several blocks of cigarmakers ' cottages are remodeled for next season into inexpensive tourist bungalows it will help the looks of the town , the tourist business , and the owners of the property ; but what will become of the unemployed cigar-makers who now live in those cottages virtually rent free ? And suppose the town , as a community , is set back on its feet ; suppose the unclean spirit of greed and short-sightedness finds its house empty , swept , and garnished , it might collect seven other devils like unto itself and move back in , and the last state of that town would be worse than the first . The private enterprise which was expected to come in after the government had primed the pump failed to appear last winter ? unless you count a couple of night clubs which would have been all right in Miami Beach but were distinctly out of place in Key West , and several roulette @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odds in favor of the house are about five times as heavy as usual . It is my guess that private capital will never be much interested in Key West so long as the place is governed by disinterested outsiders . There is talk of replacing the old city and county by a three-man commission ? one locally elected , one appointed by the Governor , one appointed from Washington ; but the more successfully the town is rehabilitated , the less chance of that reform ever going over . Meanwhile somebody is making money out of the rehabilitation ? definitely not the men who are doing the work ; the rumors going about Key West and Miami have touched none of them . But city bonds that sold as low as 12 , county bonds that sold as low as 25 , have almost doubled in price ; as Key West approaches solvency they will be refunded , and somebody will make a neat profit . Before the FERA took charge it was proposed that the government buy up the bonds to prevent that ; but if the government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury would run dry in a week . People who can hold those bonds will get some of their money back ; as for the distressed sellers , they arc simply out of luck . Absumet heres Caecuba dignior ? an observation which applies to more than one aspect of life in Key West . VI It has been quite a strain on the inhabitants , all this hullabaloo ? greatest strain of all , perhaps , the impact of new ideas ; for while Key West in many ways is unique , in some ways it is like any other small town . One of the night clubs entertained its customers with a very inferior floor show , including a fan dancer whose fans ( this is Mildred Harris 's line , not my own ) were only an off-stage noise . Obscenity is a matter of opinion , but if that act was not obscene it certainly missed its intention . Most of the solid citizens of Key West ? not so different from the solid citizens of Kokomo or Kankakee ? were there with their wives , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this new sophistication ; and when the dance was over one of them observed , " Well , the way you got ta look at a thing like that is , it 's Art . " He was prepared to believe that because Key West had to swallow a good deal as Art last winter that it had never seen before . Painters at work got used to having passers-by ask them , " Why do you want to paint a picture of that old ruin ? Why not paint one of our beautiful buildings ? the high school , or the courthouse ? " On the walls of the Delmonico restaurant there had hung for years some really atrocious murals of domestic manufacture ; a new set painted by one of the imported artists was presented to Mr. Aquilino Lopez , the proprietor , by a benevolent Uncle Sam . Mr. Lopez meekly accepted the gift ; but he moved his old murals into his liquor store next door , where he could look at them himself all the time . Mr. Antonio Pena Morales , whose bar is to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed to accept some murals on the supposition that they would be little ones ; when one morning the government sent him a whole truckload of art he went into eruption and sent it back , not without the hearty applause of some of the oldtimers who felt that , however good those paintings may have been , Pena 's overlaid with art was no longer Pena 's . So with the problem of shorts , which was an agitated issue all winter . Julius Stone , observing that shorts were the most sensible and comfortable costume in that climate , issued not indeed an edict but a request that all administration employees should wear them . But local girls in the office , who had to deal with negro or Cuban relief applicants , did not like the idea ; and any Southerner will understand their feelings . Beyond that , shorts never had been worn in Key West ; they were not part of the traditional atmosphere ; to any habitual visitor ? still more to any native ? they look out of place , even though they might @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But next year , in all likelihood , Key West will be wearing shorts ; and so will be a little less like Key West , a little mare like Juan-lesPins . Julius Stone 's experiment is likely to be measurably successful ; and a measurable success is perhaps as much as can be hoped for any human undertaking . It was lucky that the town fell into the hands of a perceptive man ; the ordinary administrator , seeing only the relief problem , might have tried to make it over into another Miami Beach . Stone appreciated Key West for what it was , and so did Ned Bruce who herded the artists down there . Last winter they gave the town invaluable publicity , but next winter ? ? The danger , the almost inescapable danger , is that the success of this first season will turn Key West into an artists ' and writers ' colony . And what happens to every artists ' and writers ' colony everywhere ? Why , people swarm in who want to live near artists and writers ; and presently the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for some place as yet undiscovered by the public where they can get some work done . The more the FERA succeeds in putting Key West over as a tourist town , the more surely it will lose some of the quality that originally attracted tourists . You can not ask people to starve for the sake of being quaint ; but an old devotee of Key West can not help shuddering at the prospect that a few years from now the surviving unemployed cigarmakers may be hired by some tourist agency to sit in the Duval Street caf ? s , being quaint at so much a week . This whole enterprise began because Julius Stone fell in love with Key West ? the old Key West , as it was ; and it may prove that Oscar Wilde was right when he said that each man kills the thing he loves . VII To come back from Key West to Miami , especially by air , is like returning to the earth from Mars . In Key West you have stopped reading the newspapers because they deal with happenings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the pink stucco palaces and blue-tiled swimming pools of Cocoanut Grove you have come back from the fourth dimension ; and presently you find yourself in a Miami hotel , surrounded by people who look as if they could never appreciate Key West , old or new ; and you buy an evening paper to see who won the sixth race at Hialeah , and whether the Administration is holding the Senate in line at Washington . . . . But when memory of coral sands and tropic seas has faded , and the surcharged centripetal excitement of Key West already seems a little incredible in retrospect , one thing remains ? the picture of a group of intelligent men and women applying their intelligence ( under whatever handicaps , with however limited success ) to the problems of a community which could not save itself ? people who get not much more than a maintenance wage , most of whom can hope for no personal glory from success ; whose only incentive is a disinterested desire to do as well as possible a job that needs doing . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can not help finding hope for the future in that spectacle .
