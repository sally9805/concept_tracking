One evening last week a show was staged in the White House . In the East Room , from 7 to 8 p. m. , President &; Mrs. Franklin Roosevelt of the U. S. , President &; Mrs. David Dubinsky of the International Ladies ' Garment Workers Union and a few other guests watched a " command performance " of Pins &; Needles , the I. L. G. W. U. show that has become a Broadway hit ( TIME , Dec. 20 ) . <P> For its performance , the White House furnished a makeshift stage , all props except a seltzer bottle ( the White House uses club soda ) . Secret Service men forbade the use of a five-and-ten-cent-store cap pistol . The President roared , particularly at the skit It 's Not Cricket to Picket . After watching FTP Plowed Under , a travesty on the Federal Theatre , F. D. R. remarked : " I wish the Senate and House could see this one . " After listening to Harold Rome 's Call It Un-American with its <P> When investigating Senators establish that your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tattered breeches <P> Never stoop to contradict the socialistic sons of bitches <P> Call them unAmerican . <P> the President commented : " That gives me an idea for a speech . " <P> After the show , the President asked Louis Schaffer , executive director for Labor Stage , Inc. , how the Manhattan critics had reviewed the show . Said Schaffer : " Fine . " " Even the Sun ? " asked F. D. R.* <P> Later that evening , like troupers doing a two-a-night , the cast of Pins &; Needles moved on to Washington 's Mayflower Hotel to perform before Madam Secretary Perkins and 1,000 others , in honor of the 25th anniversary of the Department of Labor . At the Mayflower the show went over big a second time . In the audience was William Green , President of the A. F. of L. ; conspicuously absent was John L. Lewis , who is at outs with I. L. G. W. U. 's Dubinsky . During the song One Big Union for Two , which is propaganda for the C. I. O. , Green @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked uncomfortable . <P> Both at the White House and the Mayflower the show was cut . Omitted from both performances was a sketch , Little Red School House and a ballet , The General Is Unveiled . Omitted at the White House were Sunday in the Park , Men Awake , and What Good Is Love . Omitted at the Mayflower were political songs and skits , Call It Un-American , Four Little Angels of Peace , Mussolini Handicap . FTP Plowed Under , Public Enemy No. 1 , and the dance Doing the Reactionary : * <P> Do n't go left but be polite , <P> Move to the right <P> Doing the reactionary . <P> All the best dictators do it , <P> Millionaires keep stepping to it , <P> The four hundred love to sing it , <P> Ford and Morgan swing it . <P> * Critic Richard Lockridge of the right wing New York Sun praised Pins &; Needles , though in somewhat gingerly fashion . *Quoted by special permission of copyright owners , Mills Music Inc.          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
