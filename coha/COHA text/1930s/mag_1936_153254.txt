In the first game of the two-out-of-three series for polo 's Cup of the Americas last fortnight , Greentree , representing the U. S. , was roundly beaten by Argentina , 21-to-9 . There were two reasons for the defeat ( TIME , Sept. 28 ) . One was the superiority of the Argentine ponies . The other was the superiority of the Argentine players . <P> By borrowing five new mounts last week , Greentree at least tried to repair the first defect . The second was irreparable . In arranging the series the U. S. Polo Association had agreed to let the winners of the U. S. Open Championship represent the country . By substituting Winston Guest for Jock Whitney at Back and Stewart Iglehart for Gerald Balding at No. 2 , the team-with Pete Bostwick and Tommy Hitchcock at Nos. 1 and 3-could have been improved but the U. S. Polo Association well knew that no such doings were permissible . Faster turf and the new U. S. mounts made the second game at Meadow Brook last week less one-sided but the upshot was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Andrada , Andres Gazzotti , Luis Duggan and Roberto Cavanagh were the first poloists who had beaten the U. S. in an international series since England did it in 1914 . <P> In Argentina , where cattle raising is the national industry , polo is the national sport . The majority of the game 's good players are not socialites as they are in the U. S. , but ganchos ( cowboys ) . Manuel Andrada , the Babe Ruth of Argentina , is a gaucho who has been playing high-goal polo for 30 years . Gazzotti , South America 's No. 1 player , is a middle-class businessman . Luis Duggan and Roberto Cavanagh are third-generation , European-schooled sons of rich Irish-Argentinian ranching families . Cavanagh , at 20 , is currently considered the most promising poloist in the world .
