With action that was almost unprecedented in its swiftness , the courts , cooperating closely with the local and Federal authorities , quickly arraigned the defendants and held them in high bail . The Lepke gangster , Joseph ( Strawberry Joe ) Amoruso , 43-year-old ex-convict , was held in $50,000 bail by Supreme Court Justice Ferdinand Pecora , while the five persons indicted yesterday were held in bail totaling $36,500 by Federal Judge Johnson J. Hayes . Indicted by Crime Grand Jury The five indicted by the Federal grand jury are : Carl Shapiro , brother of Jacob ( Gurrah ) Shapiro , Lepke 's partner in rackets .

J. , a former aide of the late Arthur ( Dutch Schultz ) Flegenheimer , appeared before the inquiring body , which was established a week ago to make a sweeping crime investigation . The indictment , prepared by John T. Cahill , United States Attorney , charged that the five defendants had paid or caused to be paid $250 a week to Lepke since he has been a fugitive and the same amount to Gurrah until he surrendered on indictments charging conspiracy . The indictments , it was believed by Federal authorities , will have the effect of abruptly cutting off financial aid to the missing racketeer . In addition , Federal authorities declared they would make a test case of their interpretation of the harboring act as outlined in the indictments and if upheld by the courts would be able to make considerable progress in their war on crime , since all persons giving financial aid to criminals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liable to arrest . Amoruso " Important Figure " Amoruso , described by District Attorney Thomas E. Dewey as " the most important figure of any now in custody " in connection with the garment racket " excepting Gurrah , " now in the Federal Penitentiary , was arrested late Sunday night on his ; 150-acre farm at New Paltz , N. Y. , where he had been living the life of a country gentleman for three years . The arrest was made by Detective Joseph Thompson of the Manhattan Headquarters Squad , who was spending his vacation in New Paltz and recognized Amoruso from an old " wanted " photograph that had been printed in Spring 3100 , the monthly magazine of the Police Department . Also arrested with Amoruso was Jean Russo , 29 years old , who described herself as a garment worker and told the police she had been living with the gangster for the last six years . The woman was held in $10,000 bail by Justice Pecora as a material witness . Amoruse had been sought by police since he and thirteen others were indicted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gurrah . Detective Thompson , during his vacation in New Paltz , saw Amoruso several times in the town ? walking along the sidewalks or riding through the streets in his automobile . The seemingly familiar appearance of the gangster  --  especially the large pinkish-colored mole on his cheek ( that gave him his nickname of Strawberry Joe ) ? struck a chord in Thompson 's memory . Cutting short his vacation , the detective returned to the city Saturday , scanned back publications of Spring 3-1000 and finally found the photograph of the gangster . Fugitive Trailed to Farm He returned to New Peitz early Sunday morning and waited on the main street all morning until his man finally drove up to a cigar store shortly after noon . The detective entered the store , carefully scanned the gangster 's features and was certain that he was the man he wanted . When Amoruso left the store , Detective Thompson followed him a short distance out of town , saw him turn off onto a narrow dirt side road , and enter a small farmhouse about 2,000 feet from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enlisted the aid of Corporal M. A. Baker and Trooper Kline of the State Police and the three returned to the farm , where Amoruso first said that his name was Joseph Amato , " a hard working farmer , " but eventually admitted his identity when shown the police " wanted " photograph . The gangster was brought to the city early yesterday morning , and was conjIned in the Greenwich Street Police Station . Informed of the arrest , District Attorney Dewey sent Assistant District Attorney J. Victor Herwitz and Detective Philip Abbate of the grand jury squad to search the farmhouse . They seized bank books , canceled checks , bank statements and numerous other items and rounded up Miss Russo who , in the meantime , had sought to hide in a near-by farmhouse . Had Plenty of Funds According to Mr. Dewey , Amoruso , who was described as the " first lieutenant " of Lepke and who at one time reportedly had between 150 and 200 " gorillas " working under him , had apparently been living " in style " on money received from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paltz farm , showing " sizable balances , " were seized and the gangster had $500 in cash when arrested . He had bought his farm for $2,300 and had remodeled a wooden tworoom " tool house " that he used for living quarters . Set 2,000 feet back from the main road , the house had been further hidden from view by a dine of trees the gangster had planted along the highway . When arraigned before Justice Pecora , Mr. Herwitz declared that Amoruso " ran the extortion and strong-arm work in the dress industry . " Mr. Herwitz charged that Amoruso knew of the investigation into the garment racket a year before the indictment was returned on Aug. 9 , 1937 , and that he " took it on the lam " in the Fall of 1936 . Referring to the indictment , Mr. Herwitz said that while the conspiracy charge was a misdemeanor , the District Attorney 's office expected to supersede it with one that would contain " innumerable felony counts of extortion . " " Amoruso is one of the main and important figures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Before joining Lepke , he was associated with Charles ( Lucky ) Luciano . He was part of the combination . " When Miss Russo was arraigned , Mr. Herwitz said he was asking for $10,000 bail because she apparently had been associated with the gangster since he became a fugitive . Amoruso was taken to Tombs prison and Miss Russo to the Women 's House of Dentention after the bail was set . Meanwhile , the Federal grand jury , sitting in the Federal Court House , handed down its unprecedented indictments against the five officials of the two clothing companies as its first official action since its formation a week ago . The indictments specifically charge a conspiracy to violate Section 246 of Title 18 of the so-called " harboring statute , " infraction of which is a misdemeanor , punishable by a maximum sentence of six months in prison and a fine of $1,000 . While the violation of the statute in itself represents only a misdemeanor , the indictments , however , will not let the defendants , if found guilty , escape so lightly , since @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of two years and a fine of $10,000 . In addition to the charge of harboring Lepke the defendants are also charged with harboring Gurrah while he was a fugitive from June 14 , 1937 , to April 14 , 1938 . The Indictments charging a conspiracy to harbor Lepke contain seven overt acts . Amoruso Arrested Nine Times In addition to Zwillman , another grand jury witness during the day was Ruggiero ( Richie ) Bolardo , said to have been a former associate of Zwillman in prohibition days . According to Mr. Dewey 's office , Amoruso is married and has a wife and two children , who live at 4,218 Foster Avenue , Brooklyn . Amoruso has been arrested nine times since 1913 . It was announced at Mr. Dewey 's office that Harry Greenberg , known as " Big Hymie Green ' ' and listed as one of the fugitives in the Lepke search , had been deported about the time of his indictment for conspiracy and extortion in the garment racket .
