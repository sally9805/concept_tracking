Last week Liberty , nickel weekly , announced in an editorial : <P> " Every magazine , at one time or another , probably has had The Gold Bug or The Murders in the Rue Morgue sent in with some of the names changed , and has sent the fraudulent manuscript back as a matter of course . <P> " The August 16 issue of Liberty contained a story headed The Biography of Loar , by Parker Bloser . It was a good story and well liked by a lot of people who read it . The trouble with it was that Mr. Bloser did n't write it . <P> " Miss Zona Gale wrote it several years ago and called it The Biography of Blade . It appeared in Century Magazine now defunct , in a book published by D. Appleton &; Co . . . . <P> " Then , of course we received a flood of letters . The friendliest was from the person most injured-Miss Gale herself , who even offered to help the misguided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a copy of the following note : <P> " ' Dear Mr. Bloser - Various people have called my attention to your use of my story , The Biography of Blade . . . . I am deeply interested to know what caused this use of the story on your part . I wondered if I could interpret it to my publishers or to Liberty . . . . Naturally in a story which involves me so many times I feel deeply concerned to know how it could have been used in this way with you - and especially why .

According to D. Appleton &; Co. , he insisted he wrote the story himself when in school many years ago . Miss Gale expressed her belief in Bloser 's innocence of deliberate plagiarism . Bloser made a financial settlement with Liberty , received a suspended sentence .
