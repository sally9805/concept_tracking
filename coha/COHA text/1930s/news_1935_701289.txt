txt All of the major carriers now attempting capital readjustments probably will seek protection of the courts under the Bankruptcy Act as soon as agreement can be reached with large holders and assents received from some of the minority holders . Proposed amendments to Section 77-B which will empower the courts , after ICC and court approval , to make a plan of reorganization mandatory , is the principal motive for this action . If the roads filed their pleas now they would not receive the benefit of the proposed revisions of the act It is believed in rail circles that the St. Paul . Chicago &; North Western , Western Pacific and Denver &; Rio Grande Western can reorganize more speedily by pursuing their present tactics in obtaining approval of large holders and the RFC to any plan . Then the procedure would be to file under the amended Bankruptcy Act . It is pointed out that if any of these carriers were to file now under section 77B that the mandatory features , which would force minoraies into agreement , are lacking and undoubtedly there would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factor which at present is regarded with some trepidation is the proposal making it compulsory for the courts to apoint trustees for a road filing under the amended law . tinder the present act such action is permissive . This new feature . it is claimed , may cause delay chiefly if a trustee or trustees are hostile to the existing managements or to the plan . However , it is provided that the ICC list names of prospective trustees from which the court will nominate its choice . Other rail news yesterday included preliminary figures indicating that for the week ended June 22 ca.rloadings for the country , which will be reported Friday , will show a drop of more than 100,000 cars from the previous seven days . and also will be substantially under 1934 . This would cause a drop of almost 15 points in the Dow-Jones loadings index , and would be contra-seasonal . Sharp decline in coal loadings below the week ended June 15. and delay in the wheat movement , were the principal causes .

Palmer , president of the New York , New Haven &; Hartford Railroad stated yeatci day that the road had depes , ted fund , . amounting to around $3,100,000 to meet service requirements payable on or before July 1 . This is the largest immediate " hump " In interest payments which the road has to hurdle . It in now believed that the New Haven can meet its requirements throughout the summer and until November 1 . the next heavy payment date , without any difficulty .

For several months the New England governors have been considering , with New England railroad executives , plans designed to rehabilitate the carriers in that section Governor Curley did not reveal the New Haven 's recommendations . He said he would take them to Washington Wednesday night . Directors of the Pennsylvania Railroad are scheduled to meet on Wednesday . This will probably be the last meeting of the summer , the board usually adjourning during July and August . Hence , if the directors plan to pay a dividend in September , as they did In 1934 , action should be taken at Wednesday 's meeting . Pennsylvania paid two dividends in 1934 , 50 cents in March and 50 cents in September , and has paid one dividend this year , 50 cents last March . Net income for the first four months of 1935 was practically identical with the first four months of 1934 , but in any discussion of a dividend directors probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of year . While quick action generally is looked for on the Western Pacific plan , Jesse H. Jones , RFC chairman , is not favorable to it , although practically all other interested parties are .

Consequently . it will not be until the third year after the plan is effective that fixed interest requirements will reach the million dollar mark .

He said tnat since the rains had appeared . wheat had come up where none had been exp.icted . Rock Islands ' gross revenues for May showed a decrease of about 5130.000 . The grain movement over the road has just begun , some two weeks later than in 1934 .
