txt General Francesco de Pinedo sought to win new aviation honors for Italy and himself yesterday and died in the attempt . He was burned to death at Floyd Bennett Field beneath the wreckage of the Santa - Lucia , the monoplane which he had planned to fly to Bagdad . The wheels of the big Bellanca , which was to have been the modern counterpart of the fabled magic carpet , never left the ground . The plane swerved off the wide long concrete runway , bumped across 500 , . feet of uneven turf and tore through a steel fence which snapped off its broad wings and broke its whirling propeller . The ' famous Italian flier , who hoped that success in his daring venture would regain for him his lost favor in Rome , was pitched to the ground from his tiny cockpit among the gasoline tanks . Horrified but helpless witnesses saw him standing beside his ship as if trying to cut the switch a moment before its orange-red wings were engulfed in flames . After that there was nothing any one could do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been awaiting favorable weather for his effort to wrest frtnn France the record for non-stop long distance flying . He was tired of4 the delay and he must have entered the Santa Lucia yesterday with a do or die attitude . In no other ' way could aviators who knew his ability explain his failure to cut his engine and give up his attempt to lift his heavy load of gasoline and oil when the plane first swerved from the runway . Even after he lost control he could have saved his life by dumping gasoline and cutting the ignition switch , they said . General de Pinedo was one of the world 's greatest aviators . A World War veteran , former chief of staff of the Royal Air Force of Italy , he had led a formation flight of twenty-four planes to Asia Minor and had crossed the Atlantic twice by air . He was a national hero in his homeland until 1929 , when he was made air attach ? at Buenos Aires . He retired from service last December . Some said that his political downfall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Minister , who was his chief . Another more romantic versiqn was that he had incurred the displeasure of the Crown ? by daring - to pay court to Princess Giovanna , now the Bulgarian Queen . Whatever led to his virtual exile , he planned to fly over Rome on the way to Bagdad and drop a message to Premier Mussolini . Only a small crowd gathered at Floyd Bennett Field to watch the take-off , for de Pinedo had suffered so many disappointments that he forbade advance publicity .. While he slept in the administration building , where he had lived most of the time since he arrived here , the Santa Lucia , named after the quarter of Naples in which he was born  --  and incidentally the patron 11 saint of navigators  --  was towed to the head of the runway . There at the head of the path that has led to glory for some and to death for others , the big plane was made ready . The sun was rising , a red ball softened by the morning mist , which still clung close to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which General Balbo 's fleet rested during the stay of the Italian air armada . Soon after the Santa Lucia was trundled out of number 4 hangar , which had been used by Maurice Rossi and Paul Codos , the French aviators who are the present holders of the distance record , General de Pinedo appeared on the field . Unaware of the tragedy that awaited him , the crowd laughed at his appearance . He was wearing a blue business suit topped by a gray bowler hat . Around his neck he had thrown a silk muffler and on his feet were light blue bedroom slippers . He chatted casually with mechanics tuning up the airplane and calmly took charge of the fueling . Into the tanks of the Santa Lucia ? tanks that left just room enough for the pilot to crawl in  --  were pumped 1,027 gallons of gasoline innd fifty-three gallons of oil , bringg the weight of the plane close to 10,000 pounds . This was less than Codos and Rossi lifted when they took off for Ryak , Syria , but it was more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . John Carisi , a BeRance mechanic Climbed into the plane and spent about fifteen minutes testing the engine . When he had finished General de Pinedo insisted that the gallon or two of gasoline that had been used for the tests be replaced . Then he watched Ugo d'Annunzio , eon of the Italian aviator-poet , Gabriel d'Annunzio , and his technical adviser stow away food and drink for the flight . The general had picked his menu with care . Hard-boiled eggs , marrons glaces , oranges , lemons , prunes , a large thermos bottle full of hot consomme , and even salt and pepper . As beverages he took along a bottle of coffee , a bottle of tea and five quarts of water . The oranges and lemons were hung on strings in the small compartment so he could reach them without abandoning the controls . Believing that his greatest danger lay in falling asleep during the sixty hours he estimated it would take him to complete his flight , he had rigged up a device to squirt cold water in his face and sound a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its course . He took along an alarm clock to make sure his catnaps did not exceed ten minutes . The airplane was not equipped with a wireless set or a rubber boat . The flier counted on empty gasoline tanks to keep him afloat if he were forced down at sea . To insure being seen by passing liners , he carried two orange kites and 700 feet of string . He carried also a complete set of fishing tackle , believing that he could subsist on the fish he caught if his supplies ran out before he was sighted . He Expressed Confidence . When everything had been tested and pronounced fit for the flight , de Pinedo climbed to the seat over an oil tank , which he believed would make it - so uncomfortably warm that he would not fall asleep involuntarily . Before starting the engine he said good-bye to J. Nelson Kelly , manager of the airport , and expressed the belief that he would be able to get into the air before he had traversed 3,000 feet of the runway , which is 4,220 feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of safety , the steel fence between the apron and the parking space for automobiles near Flatbush Avenue was taken down , providing nearly 800 feet more of runway . General de Pinedo then promised Ugo d'Annunzio he would do his best . He started the engine , raced it and throttled it down . Then with a nod of farewell to the little group of friends-at the take-off he started down the runway . That was at 7:01 A. M. Scarcely two minutes later he was lying in the flames under his wrecked airplane . As carefully as he had prepared for his flight there was one risk he had to take in attempting a takeoff with the load he was carrying . That was the danger of loss of directional control as the tail lifted from the ground . Before the machine attains flying speed there is an interim when the rudder is virtually useless . A side gust of wind , heavy torque from the engine , a rough spot in the runway  --  any one- of these may swerve a plane off the runway . The weight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gravity as possible , aggravate such emergencies . Like a huge pendulum weight , it swings around behind the pilot , tending to push the wide wing into a crosswind position . The action takes place in a split second 's time , as the machine travels more than a mile a minute , and only those with the swiftest of coordination can manoeuvre back into the takeoff direction . Plane Leaves Runway . It was this sort of mishap which apparently befell the Italian aviator . He had traversed hardly 1,500 feet of the runway before the tail of the Santa Lucia slewed around , throwing the right wheel off the runway . Somehow he brought the hurtling ship back on her course . But 2,000 feet further along it nosed to the right again arid that time there was no getting back . Over the grass toward the administration building , with a crowd of 150 persons looking on , raced the monoplane . As the spectators fled , de , Pinedo managed to pull the fnonoplane further to the right so that he cleared the administration building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , carrying away two whole sections , was seventy-five feet from the main building . The fence did not stop the careening wingless airplane . It rolled on for another twenty-five feet before it stopped and fell over on its side . It was in that instant that witnesses saw General de Pinedo standing erect with arm outstretched in the cabin . He may have been dazed , but it seemed as if he vere trying belatedly to cut the switch and prevent the fire which started a moment later . Close behind the Santa Lucia as it raced down the runway at ninety miles an hour was Michael HicksBeach , machinist 's mate of the United States Naval Reserve base at the field , riding a motorcycle with fire extinguishers in the sidecar . He tried to extinguish the flames which enveloped the Italian , but the intense heat from the gasoline fire drove him back . His face was severely burned . View of Flier 's Friend . Following more slowly than the young machinist 's mate were d'Annunzio , Major Kelly and Colonel Mario Infante , who served @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had confidently expected that de Pinedo would give up his attempt after his wheels went off the runway . D'Annunzio was grief-stricken and mystified . Through tears he said : " He must have forgotten all he knew about flying . When a plane starts to zig-zag every one knows that the further you go the worse the zig-zagging becomes . " D'Annunzio said he believed General de Pinedo was so tired of waiting that he staked everything on the chance that the ship would rise . So intent was he on getting off the ground , d'Annunzio said , that he must have forgotten to cut the ignition switch or dump his gas when the crash became inevitable . It took firemen nearly two hours to extinguish the blaze , which left only the metal frame work of the especially constructed plane . De Pinedo 's body was found under the wreckage with the heavy engine , which had melted loose , resting across his legs . The body was taken to the Kings County morgue . In the debris that remained on the field policemen searched for a diamond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ring General de Pinedo wore .
