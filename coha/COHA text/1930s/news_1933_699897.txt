txt Napoleon on Life . To the Editor of The New York Times : Apropos of Professor Henri Pieron 's assertion that life is merely dreamed . and with reference to the very interesting letter written to Txp TINIES under date of June 26 by Mrs. Walter Graeme Eliot , all this brings to mind the famous statement made by the Emperor Napoleon during , his captivity on the island of St. Helena , 1815-21 , at which time the Emperor , in one of his pensive moments , said : " Life is a pale dream which vanishes . " Of course , it must be remembered that this statement was uttered by the Emperor at a time when he was shorn of his power , deserted by his wife , deprived of the companionship of his little son , forsaken by his former friends and cruelly humiliated and tormented by a dastardly jailer . Nevertheless , coming as it did from the greatest military leader and conqueror the world has yet produced , the statement is significant . HAROLD PAGE .
