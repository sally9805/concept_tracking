Fortnight ago , burly German peasants lifted their furrowed , mahogany faces and straightened their creaking backs from harvesting their rye to look into the faces of burly Nazi policemen , lounging menacingly nearby . By a decree styled " A Decree for Safeguarding the Bread Supply , " Agriculture Minister Richard-Wralther Darr requisitioned all wheat and rye crops for the Third Reich . To guarantee enforcement , Heinrich Himmler , with a wave of his pince-nez , directed his State police to supervise all harvesting , transporting , and storage activities . Farmers may retain only enough for their personal appetite , feeding hired hands , and seed . <P> Last week , apprehensive of passive resistance by the peasants , Nazi courts threatened fantastic fines up to 100,000 marks ( $40,000 ) if farmers knowingly disregarded the bread decree , penitentiary sentences if the infraction is " especially obnoxious . " <P> This year 's German wheat and rye harvest , damaged by a cold winter and a late , dry spring , will fall about 15% below last year 's , which was under average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign grain , while June figures show that food imports increased 16% , all of which has to be paid for out of Reichsbanker Schacht 's laboriously collected foreign exchange reserves . Aim of the grain requisition is to save for food two million tons of rye and a half-million tons of wheat previously fed to livestock . With Himmler 's strong-arm squads on duty to watch for slackers , the farmers shrugged their shoulders , took humorous consolation in the Government 's promise to sell them cheap animal fodder at $8 a ton below the market price for rye . and in Vlkischer Beobachter 's assurance that " the German peasant should be happy and willing to serve in this high cause .
