txt News of the assassination of King Alexander of Jugoslavia and Louis Barthou , French Foreign Minister , at Marseilles yesterday reached New York shortly after noon and-had a slightly unsettling effect upon security and commodity markets which already had been irregular . However , Italian , French and Jugoslavia bonds showed fairly sharp losses . Small declines were recorded by stocks and cotton . which was also reflected in other influences Grains declined but subsequently rallied and closed ' higher . Major repercuassions were registered in the foreign exchange market where sterling scored a sharp rally , while large losses were shown by the gold currencies under the leadership of French francs . Foreign observers both in New York and Washington generally concurred with the belief in Paris diplomatic circles that the assassination will prove to be more of a domestic Jugoslav difficulty than one which might have grave international consequences . Politics of Alexander Murder Fading of the Yugoslav star from the horizon of European politics may be the ultimate outcome of the assassination yesterday of King Alexander of Jugoslavia and Louis Barthou , Foreign Minister @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consequences will be largely focused with Jugoslavia in an intensification of internal difficulties there rather than immediate international repercussions of major import . The immediate importance hinges upon the nationality of the assassin He was a Croat , a subject of the murdered King . The action took place on French soil , but this was purely fortuitous since the murder was the outcome of an tnternal difficulty which dates back to the very formation of the Kingdom of Jugoslavia in 1918 . Like Switzerland , Jugoslavia is a political entity made up of distinct races . Unlike Switzerland , the peoples do not live in harmony but are constantly at swords points . In the main , the kingdom is made up of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes , an arbitrary product of the Treaty of Versailles . The dead Flag was a Serb , and therefore cordially hated by the Croats , especially because of his oppressive policies directed against all who opposed the throne . In effect , he was a virtual dictator since the dissolution of Parliament January 6 , 1929 . Country Has Long Been Sore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one-man government in Jugoslavia . With the conflicting interests withal the country maintenance of stable government in the future requires a strong man . None is now in sight to act as regent for the 21-year-old heir to the throne , now in school at Eton in England . Jugoslavia has been one of the sore spots in Europe because of friction with Italy which has been growing more intense in the past weeks . tan ally of France . it was particularly acute ! when Chancellor Dollfuss of Austria was murdered . Jugloslavia appeared to resent the impending rapprochement between France and Italy which was to have been cemented in the near future by the contemplated visit with the now dead French Foreign Minister . Louis 33arthou . Perhaps it is fortunate for the entire European situation that the assassination came now instead of a few weeks ago . In that time . Franco-Italian relations have improved considerably , while the press attacks in Jugoslavia directed against Italy have drawn forth strong Italian protests without intervention by France . Bathou 's Death Great Loss to France Had the murderer been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed because of the peculiarly delicate balance between the three powers at this time . As it is , the occurence of the tragedy on French Foil is one of the things which France must expect as long as she remains a haven for foreign political refugees . One of the strongest points in the French position now , is that fact that brilliant Louis Barthou , who has done more than any one man to restore France 's prestige abroad in the past six months , was killed with the King whom France was about to honor on a good-will visit . The French loss is a great one and places France as the unhappy victim of a domestic Yugoloslavian intrigue . Germany enters the picture in an indirect way . Although Jugoslavia is a French ally , and France had devoted considerable efforts toward cementing the friendship of the two nations , the Croats and Slovenes incline toward Geri:daisy in their sympathies , which is probably one reason why France was anxious for Jugoslav friendship . In this respect , the death of the Serb King may ultimately prove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the central European peoples , which many observers feel is bound to come . Sterling Gains Sharply A. sharp rally in sterling from the lowest gold values ever recorded came instantly upon receipt of news that King Alexander of Jugoslavia , together with Louis Barthou , French Foreign Minister , had been assassinated in Marseilles . Fears of international complications brought an immediate demand for the conversion of Continental currency balances into sterling which , aided by short covering of short sterling positiorls , drove the pound up in a sensational recovery . The local exchange market was scarcely in a position to judge the full import of the development upon tha foreign exchange market . The assassinations took place after the close of trading in Paris so that with business houses for the most part closed offerings of francs were not heavy . Holders of sterling , on the other hand , showed no inclination to sell and the pound consequently soared with little business . Foreign exchanges generally had been weak in New York . Rates , however , were steady and reflected earlier strength of the dollar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of la. cents in continuance of the downward trend while francs had broken below parity of $.066254 , off 5 0000% . Sterling Had Been at New Low In London , sterling had sunk to a new low record in terms of French francs , being quoted as low as 73.873 francs to the pound , compared with Monday 's close of 74.03 . Price of gold in London already had set a new record high , being advanced another 3d per ounce to 142s 9d . The trend of the market was reversed abruptly and sterling jumped on almost no volume to 54.83% to close at $4.92 , a . Weakness in francs and the gold currencies was intensified and the French francs dropped to a low of $.066031 , and closed at a.0661 off ** This indicated a franc value for sterling of 74.54 francs , or about % franc above the low for the day , a wide move . The market closed with traders anxiously waiting for Europe 's reaction when full business gets under way this morning . Opinion was general that the assassination contains no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether the trend which developed Tuesday afternoon will continue will depend up : on whether Europe concurs in this opinion . Sterling Will Reflect Opinion Should Europe scent further trouble , the probability is that sterling will continue upward , motivated by both flight of capital to England plus covering of the extensive short positions which arc-aelieved to be outstanding in sterling . In this event , it is thought that the gold currencies might seek even lower levels . While the market as a whole was keeping an open mind on possibilities , there was noticeable talk of the possibility of the import of gold from France , talk stimulated by the sharp drop ui francs . Some banks believe that gold can be imported into New York from France at 5.065931 , while others place the gold import point slightly lower at around $.0659 .

New York official price advanced ' la-cent to 003i cents per ounce . Reaction in Paris PARIS ? In French diplomatic circles there was much relief when the report was received that King Alexander was murdered not by an Italian or a Frenchman , but by a Croat representing a racial minority which has always complained of represison by the King . President Albert Lebrun will temporarily take over the foreign ministry left vacant by the death of Louis Barthou . Since the heir to the throne is a mere boy . .1 .. is believed that Jugoslavia will decline in importance as an international factor , especially as it is likely to be faced by a long period of internal troubles . Thus the formidable barrier to French reccnciliation with Italy which was offered by the enmity between King Alexander and Mussolini may disappear . On the other hand . France loses in Foreign Minister Barthou a statesman whose record @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restored the prestige of French diplomacy abroad and who laid down the lines for a vigorous policy in the future . These lines certainly will be followed by his successor but scarcely with the energy and skill which Barthou displayed . Paris Bourse Strong News Of - the assassinaticn was not received in Paris until after the closing of the Paris Bourse , so that prices did not reflect the event . The Bourse made a remarkable spurt on Tuesday under the influence of the results of the Cantonal elections on Sunday which showed no growth in revolutionary sentiment . In addition , confirmation of the successes of the Treasury pond issue had a stimulating effect . Rchtes were up 1. to 21. s francs . Bank , electrical and chemical shares gained 2 ' to 3 , ar . while even the Young loan advanced 19 points The improvement in the Bourse was especially noteworthy because it was accompanied by a fall in the value of sterling to 73.81 francs although the rate returned later to 73.89 in a market which was not overactive , but which apparently is now convinced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parity of the dollar . London Views Assassination LONDON ? If , as it appears now , the assassination of King Alexander I of Jugoslavia was the act of disgruntled Croatians , it is liable to open up disturbing possibilities . Alexander 's practical dictatorship in Jugoslavia had suppressed the Croats and the latter 's disaffection had lately been fanned by Italy , increasing Italo-Jugoslav tension . If the assassins are repudiated by Croat leaders , the situation in Belgrade may be smoothed over , it is thought here , but if not , and if a military dictatorship should replace Alexander and carry out retaliatory measures on the Croats , civil war might result . Such a development would be difficult to localize , owing to the tension on the Jugoslav frontiers . The death of Louis Barthou , it is thought here , also endangers the completion of the Franco-Italian pact and the betterment of ItaloJugoslav relations which he was trying to negotiate as a counter measure to a possible **33;369;TOOLONG bloc .                 @ @ @ @
