Western Mortorium <P> Arthur Curtiss James , owner of more railroad stocks than any man in the U. S. , controls only one major road-Western Pacific . While Western Pacific was pleading for a $1.000,000 loan from RFC last summer , it was revealed that Mr. James owned 352,000 of its 574.000 common shares . Western Pacific did not get that particular loan because it had already pledged all its available collateral , but it did manage to meet the interest on its first mortgage bonds due Sept. 1 . Last week the due date came &; went again but Western Pacific did not pay . <P> Instead , the road asked its bondholders for a one-year moratorium . All interest due this year would be paid in a lump sum in 1937 . The junior creditors have already agreed to a moratorium provided holders of 75% of the first mortgage bonds also waive their claims . In a joint statement Chairman Thomas Milton Schumacher and President Charles Elsey held forth this hope : " The traffic of the railroad has shown progressive improvement for the past six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the funded debt cooperate . . . the company will be able to meet its other obligations and no judicial reorganizations . . . will be necessary . " <P> Western Pacific 's plans for avoiding a bankruptcy reorganization were aided by the fact that its creditors were not the usual army of anonymous bondholders . The first mortgage bonds are substantially its entire funded debt and one-half of them are owned by a few big insurance companies like Metropolitan Life ( $6,852,000 ) , Prudential ( $3,000,000 ) , New York Life ( $1.300.000 ) . Its junior creditors are not junior bondholders but the RFC ( $3,000,000 ) . Railroad Credit Corp . ( $1,300,000 ) and Western Pacific RR Corp . ( $5,600.000 ) . <P> Western Pacific has not earned its fixed charges for three years . Given a year 's time , however , Proprietor James thinks he can pull it through alive . The 200-mile link he built in California to connect Western Pacific with Great Northern , completed in 1931 , has not yet revealed its full traffic possibilities . The Dotsero cutoff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is expected to direct transcontinental traffic to the Denver &; Rio Grande-Western Pacific route ( TIME , Feb. 12 ) .
