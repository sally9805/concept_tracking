txt Permanent ownership and operation of low cost housing* units all over the country is the ultimate objective of PWA 's housing officials . These are now engaged in elaborating plans for spending the $450,000,000 earmarked for housing under the new bill , and more if President Roosevelt says the word . The alum clearance program is now in the courts , because of a decision that federal condemnation of slums is unconstitutional . However , PWA professes not to be worried . Officials explain that many states and counties already have their own laws empowering condemnation , and if higher courts uphold the Louisville , Kentucky . District Court decision , the federal government can push passage of more such local laws , and work through them to buy land for cheap housing . Properties in 71 Cities When a new allotment is made from the works bill , the housing division will move to buy up slum properties in 77 cities which have made application . It is estimated that money can be thrown into about 25% of these at once , that contracts for construction @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ month , that projects involving a total ultimate outlay of $200,000,000 can be approved immediately , and another total of like amount a few months later . Officials make no secret of the fact that they expect to come under strong pressure to resume allotments to limited dividend corporaions . These are private organizations which receive federal grants and build their own low cost housing units with profit controlled by a limit on dividends to be earned . Every effort will be made to avoid such a move . PWA tried it once , but claims private capital was too greedy . It is charged that attempts were made to write up value of properties in order to swell the dividend total allowable . There were 533 applications for limited dividend projects , totaling $1.000,000.000 , but only seven projects were approved , and the whole idea was halted at that point . Under the new program the emphasis will be on federal projects . Some high officials of the housing division desire to issue securities to the public against the low cost apartments . This would create a revolving fund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations for the pur-pose were exhausted . No decision has yet been made on the matter . The housing division explains it has been working forward from a long range viewpoint , not being inclined to look upon its work as primarily an emergency reemploymen tmeasure . The division has several plans for financing slum clearance and low cost unit construction , according to A. R. Clas , assistant chief of the agency . Plan Most Favored The one most favored by officials provides only for amortization of 70% of the federal funds going into construction of the new buildings . Outlays for land purchase would not be amortized , on the theory that improvement to the properties would result in an increase in value and the federal government could get its , money out by sale to state housing authorities . These are the agencies which would b set up to take over the low cost housing units from the federal government on a permanent basis . Rental scales in low cost housing units have not yet been announced , but it was learned that these are expected to run @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If land purchases are not amortized , a reduction from these scales of from 6 cents to 35 cents is believed possible . Land cost runs from 15% to 25% of the total cost of a given project . Of all PVVA Administrator Ickes ' schemes for expanding his original $3,300,000,000 , the housing division , which was assigned $150,000 , - 000 , has been the slowest to get underway . All its money has been allotted , but only $6,000,000 has been spent . A total of 105 acres , for six projects is actually owned . Construction has started on one unit , in Atlanta Bids are being let on one , and are being invited on three others . Options are held on 1,056 acres for 39 more projects . This snail pace is explained as the result of the preliminary work that had to be done ? buying of options , clearing of titles , hiring of architects , etc. , and particularly the need for " educating " the public to the slum clearance idea . Now , it is claimed , the groundwork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
