In Columbia , S. C. fortnight ago Will Pickens White , an obscure piebald , pursed-mouthed Negro of 68 , leaped from his bed yelling : " Jesus , my God , what is this ! " Night before Will Pickens White had taken a bath . This morning his entire skin was as dead white as a flounder 's belly . <P> To newshawks who last week investigated the " miracle , " Mr. White told a tale which doctors recognized as the history of a case of vitiligo , a harmless but mysterious skin condition which an occasional Negro develops . " About 30 years ago I had a little pimple on my forehead , " said Will White . " I went to the barber shop and got some medicine to get rid of the pimple . Next morning I woke up with pimples all over my face . The medicine was n't no good . The pimples kept coming and going . When they 'd go they 'd leave a white spot . " The blotching spread until it brought about the depigmentation suddenly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Negroes is no rarity . It has sometimes been checked by doses of gold or arsenic compounds but hardly ever cured because no researcher has yet satisfactorily established the constitutional cause of the discoloration of a Negro 's skin . <P> Negroes who want to hide their markings daub themselves with black coffee , potassium permanganate solution or dilute iodine . Will Pickens White last week indicated that he would never tint his whiteness . Said he : " God intended to let people know what He could do . Now that I am white , I would rather stay that way .
