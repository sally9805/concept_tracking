Nobody remembers his name but oldtime vacationers at Atlantic City , N. J. ( " Playground of the World " ) say that the resort 's first sand sculptor was a young artist who showed up on the beach one day in the 1890 's and molded from a mountain of wet sand a lifelike figure of a scantily-clad young woman clutching a baby . He labeled the result " Cast up by the Sea . " The piece so affected passersby on the boardwalk above that they tossed coins down to the artist , who was soon followed to the beach by other itinerant modelers . By 1910 sand sculptors , with bucket , blanket or hat to receive contributions , had become as much an Atlantic City fixture as its wheelchairs , fortune-tellers and Million-Dollar Pier. * <P> To promote interest , sand sculptors took to modeling topical subjects . Roosevelt I long reigned a favorite . Then came Woodrow Wilson , doughboys emerging from trenches , caricatures of the Kaiser , militant suffragets , airplanes , Lindbergh , Mickey Mouse . The more enterprising even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Delaware . Most subjects were done in bas-relief . Although whispering lovers and mermaids survived all passing fancies , religious figures were ruled out some 17 years ago when a colored life-size Crucifixion ( green cross , brown Christ , vivid red thorns and nails ) remained intact after a rainstorm and such throngs of the pious came to kneel and pray before it that bathers were inconvenienced . <P> Figures carved from wet sand are vulnerable to rain , wind and tide . Long ago the sand sculptors learned to mix one part of cement with three or four parts of beach , and their creations will withstand two or three years of hail or high water . But last week another force threatened to wipe out permanently much of the itinerant artists ' handiwork and a livelihood which , although sand sculpturing has remained the piece de resistance and principal attraction , has lately come from the more lucrative practice of sketching board-walkers who pause to gawp at the modeling . Last week 's threat came from the City Hall where Mayor Charles D. White , mindful that ice-cream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that beach artists are unlawful trespassers , have " no more right to do business on the beach than anyone else . " What had aroused Mayor White was the sand sculptors ' latest elaboration of their trade : making exhibits so big and permanent that they can live in them .
