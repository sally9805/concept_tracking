Newsfolk in Italy work under the only Dictator who knows journalism 's every twist and straightaway . In personal letters to friends abroad last week Rome correspondents built up a backlog of excited rumor against which Il Duce 's way with the Press blazed with startling highlights . <P> Remembering how Cub Reporter Benito Mussolini once lived in fear of being fired by a capricious editor , the Dictator with his 1927 Charter of Labor protected the status of all Italian employes with a nationwide , mandatory system of labor contracts and gave extra protection to working journalists . <P> Today the editor who " dismisses for no fault " one of his staff in Italy faces a suit which Italian courts usually decide by awarding the ousted staffman damages amounting to half his yearly salary , plus an extra month 's pay for every year of his service before he was " fired . " On the basis of this law , Correspondent Thomas B. ( " Tom " ) Morgan was considered by his Rome colleagues last week to have excellent chances of collecting from United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's salary for each of the twelve years he has served with that news service , plus other compensation under the Charter of Labor for a possible total of 1,000,000 lire ( $81,000 ) . <P> United Press broke with Newshawk Morgan on Oct. 1 , replacing him as Rome manager with G. Stewart Brown . When the imminence of war seemed to multiply his value as the Rome correspondent closest to Il Duce who had made him a Commander of the Order of the Crown of Italy years before , Tom Morgan tried to get his salary multiplied . Getting the sack instead , he is thought to have a routine testimonial to his good work and many scoops of the past twelve years . Such a document , under Italy 's Labor Charter , is prime evidence on the crucial issue of whether he was " dismissed for no good fault . " <P> Dictator Mussolini , although his Charter of Labor may have made possible one of the great compensation suits in the history of international reporting , has nonetheless carried the U. P. well over the bump @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first shots and bomb thuds , U. P. European Manager Webb Miller has been flying the front with Premier Mussolini 's son-in-law , Count Galeazzo Ciano . <P> The Morgan affair last week was significant because it pointed up sharply a major Fascist fact , seldom realized outside Italy , namely that under the Charter of Labor the proletariat of Italy is guaranteed rights so drastic that Capital must frequently pay through the nose . Not only journalists , though they are the most pampered , but Italian workers generally see that while Fascism has made striking a crime , it also punishes with heavy cash damages an employer who simply " fires " an employe because he feels like firing him . <P> Most Italian reporters seem to fit into the bargain the Dictator offers them : " You eulogize my Dictatorship and I protect your jobs . " As to foreign correspondents , the longer they remain in Rome the more they lose their impartiality . Some turn sour and smuggle out whatever they can smell against Fascism . Others settle down sweetly to write as if on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only all the newsorgans of Italy but all Italy .
