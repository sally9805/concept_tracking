txt YOUTH SPEAKS . I am 14 years old and American born . My " ism " is Americanism . This country educates its people so that they may be citizen voters . These same voters should be able to vote for able representatives . These same representatives should be intelligent enough to pass laws which should benefit the nation . The principal monument of this great nation is its youth and spirit , the youth to carry on and the spirit to aid him . The youth gets his start in life in the schools and his encouragement from youth . Why then is it that young teachers who have not forgotten the spirit of youth are not employed , while those who have become human dictating machines are allowed to teach ? Youth must be sympathized with . No one who can not impart the spirit of the nation to a pupil should be allowed to teach . We do not wish to look back ; we want to work and look forward .
