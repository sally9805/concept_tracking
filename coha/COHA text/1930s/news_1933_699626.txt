txt How President Roosevelt plans to finance his sweeping n.tional relief and recovery program and balance the budget at the same time , has emerged in general form during discussions he has had with the press , notably last night . It is now confirmed that the new Administration will finance its tensive new ventures ' placing what President Roosevelt calls l emergency , or " starvation " spending in a category a inch is to be paid for not out of annual income I in any given year , but bonded oser a long period . Other spending , which he defines as normal , annual and recurrent , will be paid for as at present ot.t of annual revenues . Thus President Roose% elt embraces fully the budgetary theories advanced recently by a University of Chicago research group , and opposed by former President Hoover and Mr. Ogden L. Mills , former Secretary of the Treasury , The new Chief Executive draws a sharp line of distinction between the two types of spending , and in effect will be producing two budgets . : le believes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steep barrier to recovery , to call on a nation suffering from economic stringency to raise its taxes to mountainous lesels in order to pay in each year for its emergency spending . Rather , he would keep taxation down to the lowest possible level , while spending money for public works and relief with a free hand , hoping to pay all back when prosperity has returned See Future Millstone Opponents of this theon object that upon the return of mole prc ? - ? ncrous days , the tro:paser is /clue-tent to pay off the burden he ha ; accumulated , and the national continues like a millstone round the nation 's fiscal neck , getting heasier each year . Nothing daunted . President Roosevelt believes that the road to prosperity lies only in keeping taxes down and relief and recovery spending up to adequate standards . Although faced with this budgetary difficulty , the President is going ahead with the broadest plans for unemployment relief . Apart from his reforestation plan , he realizes that states and municipalities ail require help in caring for their workless , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last Administration to offer direct grants in aid . Calls It Straight Aid President Roosevelt declares that after a state or municipality has exhausted all its resources in caring for its unemployed . the Federal Government must step in . Since everybody knows that much of this money can never be reraid by the local units , the President frankly calls it a straight grant in aid and removes it from the loan category . Although he is prepared to utilize bond issues freely to pay for his emergency spending . lit Chief Executive nevertheless disagrees sharply with sonic estimates of costs . He states that the farm mortgage and home mortgage expenditures can not now be estimated . since all depends on the number of applications to transfer the mortgages into government hands But only the interest on the mortgage bonds is to be guaranteed by the Treasury , the remainder of the transaction , perhaps running toward $2,000,000,000 , will be taken up in a bond issue . Similarly , the unemployment relief program will be bonded , for public works and direct relief alike . These expenditures may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be possible , only if the budget is strictly balanced , and this the President plans to do through the quasirdictatorial powers granted in the economy bill . He is cutting veterans ' and departmental spending to the lowest mint . mum , and many of the orders for slashing pensions will be out within a week . He aims . therefore , at a ? co : , - structive " balance of the books , in which all normal expenditures and receipts are accurately poised Some , at least , of the bond issues are planned to go out in small dentminations , so that the most modest investor will be able to share in the recovery program as he did In the Liberty Bond issues . Along these lines , therefore , President Roosevelt hopes to continue his task of achieving the impossible . He will balance the budget . and increase spending at the same time . Naturally , the budget will carry a substantial service charge on the hand issues . And his plans are still in formative stage , possible of mien future alteration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not apply in ? crisis  --  with the evident* of the wartime spending as a weithty precedent  --  President literwave ? smashes ahead toward the goal of recovery .
