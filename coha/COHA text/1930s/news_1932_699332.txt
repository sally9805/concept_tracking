It was made known some time ago that he would spend the Christmas holiday in the Holy Land . To any one who knows his Shaw it seemed inevitable that before running over to take a look at the Land of the Book he would tell the truth about both . Before he drops in on this country next year it will be no great surprise if he publishes a book summing up America . SHAW finds much to praise in the Bible , and has resisted the temptation to be original . When he would discard the folklore and tribal legend of the Bible and retain its high spiritual aspirations , he does what a great many people have been doing for generations . He actually calls to account the Soviet leaders for throwing out the spiritual values with the superstitions .

How the American Very Far people in 1929 spent an Above income of $80,000,000 , - Stary ation. 000 was shown on a chart accompanying Mr. DuFFus 's article on socialized medicine in THE TrzerEs of last Sunday . Food took $16,000,000,000 , or 20 per cent ; rent took 16 per cent , fuel and light 21h per cent and clothing 12 per cent . In other words , the four great items that enter into subsistence absorbed a trifle more than half of the nation 's income . With all the privation , suffering , and in some cases actual destitution , which are now the portion of the American people , it is still absurd to make unemployment synonymous with " starvation . " as is done too often , with the best intentions no doubt . The burden of unemployment and business prostration is very heavy in the world today . It is not a staggering burden in a community whose minimum needs can be met out of half its income @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ larger as one goes down in the income scale . Families with an income of $900 to $2,500 spend nearly 40 per cent on food and a total of about 75 per cent on the four main items of subsistence . In this class the payroll of today would permit the full previous expenditure on food but cut the other items by something more than one-third .

He figured prominently in the post-election news as one of the young men to whom a badly drubbed Republican party must look for hope and leadership . What could be more natural , therefore , than Mr. MILLS getting right to work on March 5 in a Washington office suite criticizing the Democrats like anything for the next four years ? If there is anybody more addicted to superstition than the ordinary voter , it would be the intellectuals who specialize in the behavior of the average voter .

Week after week and month after month and year after year , says this new doctrine , Mr. Hooves 's faults and mistakes and omissions were played up for the benefit of the American people , and , just as little drops of water will wear away a stone , so this persistent rain of pitiless publicity from Democratic headquarters wore down the President 's 444 electoral votes in 1928 to 59 electoral votes in 1932 . America 's belief in No One press agency is by no Blames means so strong as it Presidents . was three years ago . We are now aware that those pre-1929 triumphs of salesmanship in every sphere were something less than the work of supermen . It was a time when anybody could sell anybody else anything . But much of the national faith in salesmanship remains , and it is still fairly easy for some of us to believe that a skilled and aggressive - public , ity campaign defeated Mr. HOOVER .

Without such a professional censor , you see , President ROOSEVELT is in danger of getting away with murder . Republican editors will do nothing to point out his mistakes . Republicans in Congress will do nothing to point out flaws in his record . OGDEN L. MILLS and JAMES W. WADSWORTH Jr. , without a thought for 1936 , will refuse to utter a word in dispraise of Mr. ROOSEVELT . The President of the United States has so notoriously been free from any kind of censure in the course of our entire history , so universally the object of unstinted admiration and approval , that unless the Opposition specially hires somebody to criticize the President no one will do it . It was , as we all know , the " literature " from Democratic headquarters that defeated a President whom everything else combined to re-elect ? business conditions , wheat , employment , prohibition issue and the devoted support of his Western Senators .
