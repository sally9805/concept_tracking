txt EXCERPTS FROM LETTERS ON SUBJECTS OF CURRENT INTEREST Too Much Expected . One fact stands out like a cameo in the present confusion and welter of economic catastrophe and political experiment , namely , that the people of America expect too much from their government . This , despite unvarying historical proof that no government in the world 's history has ever of itself been able to bring prosperity and happiness to the governed . At the most , some governments have kept better order than others , with the least interference with popular rights ; but first and last , the peace , prosperity and general wellbeing of a nation have depended solely upon the people themselves . If the governed have shown a high average of courage , justice and honesty there has always been prosperity and happiness . No statesmanship , professional wisdom or political formulas have ever been useful substitutes for these essential qualities . ? HYACINTHE RINGROSE , New York .
