Fall and Rise : Theatre Notes I REMEMBER , once in a box at the Philharmonic when Madame Frieda Hempel sang some piece of fioritura from an Italian opera , my right-hand neighbor 's comment . She thought , she told me , it had been sung beautifully , but did not like that kind of music . I said , " But it 's not that kind of music . " I recall that moment now as a commentary on Miss Ethel Barrymore 's production of " The School for Scandal . " I can see perfectly the point that theatre people make : when so many trashy occasions get safely past journalistic criticism , why pounce on every attempt to do something worth while or to revive a treasure out of theatrical history ? There are various answers to that , but for the nonce we will let it stand as good doctrine . This , there fore , is no assault on the latest revival of Sheridan ; on the contrary , the stage can be grateful for the intention and for the chance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seen at all in all their lives . I am only taking up Miss Barrymore 's version of " The School for Scandal " when its New York engagement is already closed , and I am using it only as an illustration of a point . Everybody , I suppose , has discerned that acting follows drama , that the kind of acting we are to have is determined by the kind of drama that has arrived and is on hand to be acted . With the coming of realistic drama , actors had to unlearn many of their hard-earned technical lessons , to get convincingly down from their classical or sure-fire highhorses , and to release themselves into something closer and more habitual in men 's daily life . You can imagine Mrs. Siddons , for example , in " The Second Mrs. Tanqueray , " knocking marble pieces off herself at every turn . You can not imagine at all Miss Pauline Lord as Moliere 's Celimene . Our acting nowadays has accustomed itself to the ways of realism and prose actuality . The amount of conscious technique is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has never really been aroused ; their attitude is casual , their method is hit-or-miss or is seen as a form of personal expression . It has finally come about , as one of the products of our modern sort of drama and the needs of our theatre , that people are not taught any acting at all . Now that Belasco is dead , there are not even directors who could give a player a lesson , as he could do and did do , on however undistinguished a plane it may often have been . What our actors know and can do derives from practice and experience , from their fitness for the role attempted , from their developed sense of the audience , and so on and so on . We have plenty of good actors , but acting itself as a technical accomplishment and study is in a state of chaos ; the stress is on what is special to the actor himself , not on scales and fingering . When it comes to revivals out of the past , drama on which the style and character @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how can we expect to manage ? If you want to do Shakespeare , for instance , what is there to lead you to expect that you can , by merely going out into the theatres , find young players , at least players young enough to keep us awake , who in the course of four weeks ' rehearsal , with a director who himself never had any training in this style of dramatic art , can by mere will and Purpose read blank verse ? The chances are that they can not even speak an English that is not merely casual or worse . As for the slant of mind by which Shakespearean drama is even modestly apprehended , you could not promise yourself a dozen instances in the whole general run of our Players . As to that evening of " The School for Scandal , " the old piece shone through sometimes in spite of the production , which was not noticeably bad so much as it was just nothing at all beyond a strange , dignified blank . No need to stay on the subject , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous screen came away and Miss Barrymore delivered a sincerely grateful sermon of thanks and good resolutions from Lady Teazle , who by that time had subsided into the solemnity of a pre-war problem play and forgotten that the eighteenth century had ever existed . Sir Peter 's surprise at seeing his wife emerge from another man 's concealment would have been nothing to Sheridan 's at seeing these solemn matters thus exposed where he had never dreamed of finding them . All that may pass , if you like , so long as we remember , for Sheridan 's sake and art 's sake , that this kind of thing on which you pass judgment is not this kind of thing . For reasons connected with such a discussion , it is hard for people to understand the accounts of someone 's going time after time to see the same play ? an old Frenchman , for example , who has seen " The Cid " a score of times and means to see it again . It is impossible to imagine going time and time again to see a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charms of the leading actor . The capacity for repeated interest must , unless the theatre-goer is the softest or loosest of fans , rest in technical exploration , as we might enjoy hearing Mr. Toscanini and Mr. Stokowski and half a dozen other conductors attack the " Ninth Symphony . " How ? will this scene be interpreted ? this line read ? this passage spoken ? these are the kind of questions that imply repetition and cultivated interest in theatregoing . There are many other virtues and healthy elements in the theatre art , of course , but this exact element , before and behind the footlights , is one of its basic continuities . Many a man in New York will hear the same Beethoven every year again for years . We can think of shall we say Shakespeare in that connection ; and then ask ourselves how many people , with how many plays and with how many actors , will sit waiting to see how a passage will be read , what pitch given the attack , what tempo taken , what satisfactory tradition maintained , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much to decry as it is to understand . There may be good reasons for things being as they are in our theatre , good or bad ; but it can do no harm knowing how they are . If there is no conscious and studied technique , based on training and tradition , the chances for revival and revisiting are cut down to the limit . How much we lose thereby , how much we gain , is another discussion . " .4 By a curious sort of reversion from Sheridan and Shakespeare we come to Mr. Behrman 's case . In " Brief Moment " he has tried to push forward a certain quality that he especially chooses to be present in his playwriting . What Mr. Behrrnan finds is a theatre in which at one time , a good many years ago , there was a good deal of the conversation of dramatists like Shakespeare , Otway , Goldsmith , to cite a mere three of them . But such talk is forgotten on our stage , or merely reserved for revivals and ambitious occasions . Our drama @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contrivances ; a gift here and there for powerful dramatic images ; it boasts good narrative , varied and interesting characters , lively dialogue . But thought , intimate and complex ideas exchanged between human beings , abstraction and generalities , our stage is unaccustomed to . The proof of this , if you need any proof , might be found when we undertake any more or less average Latin play , one of Benavente 's for example . Those spreading speeches , those moralizing or philosophic or analyzing discourses , come down on our actors like a pall . They are puzzled as to how such dialogue should be attacked . What can not be cut from their speeches entirely they get through as best they can . Where a Latin actor would merely stand still , letting this play of his mind appear , you will see most of our actors putting in this and that piece of stage business , inserting apologetic movements for relief , trying to give an air of naturalness or whimsy to these lines that seem to them both unlikely and uncomfortable , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wordy and undramatic , for the simple reason , first , that the words have not been absorbed by the actors into the acting substance that they are supposed to create , and , second , that the translator or adapter has not been able to give the speeches any sort of reality or likelihood that would carry them across the footlights . Mr. Behrman , then , comes along and wants to put into his play such things as people sometimes may think and say in this our time , and as we find in books , fiction , essays , poetry , and here , and there in the modern world 's drama ; not necessarily profound things , but certain responses , reactions , exchanges , that hive their necessity and point . He is confronted with this state of affairs in our theatre ; which though it undoubtedly has qualities more robust and dramatic than this of his , yet needs also the extension or possibility of what he tries for . He is not only confronted with this technical habit against which he must struggle , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ country where there is practically no conversation and is speaking to an audience most of whom never heard a conversation in their lives . Some of these may have read such matters in books and felt them in their own selves even , but the habit of hearing them spoken between people they are unused to . Almost any analysis or subtlety if expressed in stage conversation alone will seem either undramatic or unlikely to them . In some ways it is possible for a theatre , as it is for a citizen , to reach a good stalwart manhood without having quite grown up .
