" It is not too much to say that what we are now here considering today is the question of plunging a dagger into the very heart of democracy ! " <P> Shouted at a packed Senate Chamber by Massachusetts ' David Walsh , these violent words week were the final major volley of the bitterest political fight of 1938-against Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's plan to reorganize the executive department of the Federal Government . After portly Mr. Walsh had completed his tirade , echoed only a shade less vehemently by Senators Tydings , Vandenberg and Borah , the Reorganization Bill came to its two final votes . <P> First question put to the Chamber was whether to recommit the bill-i.e. , kill it . As the roll call proceeded , every Senator except three ( Florida 's Pepper , Indiana 's Van Nuys , Nevada 's McCarran ) was present on the floor . Then , while the gallery- so crowded that young Mrs. James Roosevelt had to sit on the stairs-held its breath , the votes were counted . Result was 48-10-43 , against recommittal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the bill itself . This time the count was 49-0-42 for passage , and the Senate 's fight was over . <P> Most extraordinary feature of the battle over Reorganization-next to last year 's battle over the plan to enlarge the Supreme Court , noisiest of the Roosevelt Administration-was its timing . When the President launched his Reorganization Plan 15 months ago , it was far more drastic than the bill the Senate voted for last week . Nationwide reaction was total apathy . When the Reorganization Plan emerged on the Senate floor a month ago , instantaneous reaction of Congress and a large section of the U. S. press and public was a horrified suspicion that Franklin Roosevelt wanted to make himself a dictator . Reason for this superficially bewildering paradox was , of course , that the Court Plan , brought up and beaten since the Reorganization Bill 's inception , looked enough like a grab for power to make anything remotely resembling another power grab doubly alarming and doubly vulnerable . <P> As drafted by South Carolina 's Byrnes - who helped conduct the fight against the Court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any or all of the 100-odd agencies under the executive branch ; 2 ) calls for a single Civil Service Administrator instead of a three-man commission ; 3 ) splits disbursing and auditing functions by abolishing the Comptroller General who has previously done both , giving the first half of his job to the Director of the Budget , the second to a newly created Auditor General ; 4 ) sets up a Department of Welfare ; 5 ) empowers the President to hire six administrative assistants . Major basis for the claim that Reorganization would give the President dictatorial authority lay in the wording of Title I , whereby Congressional disapproval of any of his proposed changes in Government agencies must be made within 60 days and is still subject to Presidential veto , which can be overridden only by a two-thirds vote .
