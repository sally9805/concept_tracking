In the famed case of the Scottsboro Boys , the original charge was rape in a freight gondola , the ultimate issue was Alabama justice . Of the nine Negroes accused , four were acquitted , four sentenced to long jail terms , one sentenced to death ( TIME , April 20 , 1931 , et seq . ) . Last week Alabama justice yielded another inch . Governor Bibb Graves commuted the death sentence of Clarence Norris , now 25 , to life imprisonment . In Manhattan , the International Labor Defense , innocent . This does n't close the case . We will go ahead until he and the four remaining boys are free . " <P> *The sparing of Negro Norris last week kept intact the boast of Lawyer Leibowitz that no client of his had ever been executed . Two days later in Manhattan , one Salvatore Gati , 28 , was sentenced to die the week of August 15 for murdering a policeman . His lawyer , Samuel Leibowitz , was en route to Europe .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
