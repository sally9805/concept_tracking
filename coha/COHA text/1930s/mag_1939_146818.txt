The End of a Day ( Juno Films ) . For the spectacular rise of the French cinema in the years before World War II , the men most responsible have been a handful of able directors . These directors usually did not develop special talent for the camera but made movies that attracted and used the seasoned acting personnel of the French theatre . For The End of a Day , a photographic plate recording with sharp sensitivity the emotional atmosphere of a home for retired actors , Director Julien Duvivier ( Poil de Carotte , Un Cornet de Bal ) recruited a cast that includes many a distinguished veteran of the Paris stage , headed by polished , twinkling Louis Jouvet , a director of the Comdie-Franaise and one of France 's most illustrious actor-managers . Beautifully played to the last bit , The End of a Day is a glowing and worthy tribute to its profession . <P> When aging Actor St. Clair ( Jouvet ) leaves his troupe after an unsuccessful tour , he says he is going to retire to his estates , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Abbaye de St. Rivire , baven for indigent old actors . Greeted there as a hero , surrounded by old women who were once his lovers , St. Clair also meets embittered Marny ( Victor Francen ) , who has been obsessed for years by the suspicion that his wife killed herself after St. Clair tired of her . When St. Clair attempts to renew his youth by captivating a simple-minded young barmaid ( Madeleine Ozeray ) , Marny sees history repeating itself , intervenes . As the two ancient rivals match wits , the home passes through a financial crisis , a strike against short rations led by wrinkled , wry Cabris-sade ( Michel Simon ) , who spent a lifetime in the theatre understudying healthy actors . Typical shot : St. Clair , ensconced with a novel in the bathtub while his fellow inmates are clamoring at the door , magnanimously promising to leave after he has finished another chapter . <P> The Real Glory ( United Artists-Samuel Goldwyn ) is the Philippine Birth of train the Filipinos to defend themselves against the aggressive Moros-as onetime U.

This pessimistic view seems justified until Dr. Canavan ( Gary Cooper ) , an Army surgeon with a Freudian attitude towards fear , gets to work on the Filipino morale . After an epidemic of cholera , a chase in the trap-filled jungle , and a bloodcurdling Moro attack , Dr. Canavan 's and Uncle Sam 's proteges come of age . <P> The result is one of the finest action pictures since Actor Cooper and Director Henry Hathaway once before pooled their he-man talents in Lives of a Bengal Lancer . Although the plot demands that Filipinos be portrayed as terrified by Moro juramentados ( dreadnought Mohammedans to whom killing a Christian is a sure passport to heaven ) , a few such scenes were deleted by Producer Goldwyn , at the request of Commonwealth President Manuel Quezon . Excellent shots : Moros catapulting from trees over a stockade to steal ammunition ; Canavan encountering the head of a companion ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
