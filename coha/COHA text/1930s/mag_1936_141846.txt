THE CHRONICLE OF AARON KANE-Frederick Wight-Farrar &; Rinehart ( $3 ) . <P> Aaron Kane was born on an island off Shelter Point , Cape Cod , a well-meaning , red-headed boy who grew up in the great days of clipper ships , was apprenticed to a sailmaker , ran away to sea , was shanghaied in Edinburgh , kicked and cuffed as a cabin boy back and forth across the Atlantic . He survived , studied navigation , became a mate and did a little kicking and cuffing on his own , got mixed up with rebels in Genoa and , under the spell of a revolutionary temptress , ran arms for Naples until he learned that his captain had also been swayed by the same charmer and in the same fashion as himself . A captain at 21 , he drove his Silver Racer on record runs to China , married a lovely , shrewd little French-Canadian girl , was not unfaithful to her except with native women , piled up a fortune of $35,000 . During the Civil War the raiding Alabama destroyed his ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son on a voyage running Chinese to Cuba after the War , fought storms , lost his boy when a plague struck his cargo , returned to the Cape to find that his wife had run off with his wealth . <P> Except for the wooden character of its central figure , The Chronicle of Aaron Kane contains all the ingredients of a racy historical romance . The work of a portrait painter whose first novel , South , was published last year , it is illustrated with fine handsome color reproductions of Frederick Wight 's Cape Cod portraits , runs to 559 well-filled pages . But for readers these graces will not compensate for the lack of any human rattle and recklessness in hard-pressed Aaron Kane . Heroes and heroines of historical romance may be as incredible as Anthony Adverse or as absurd as Scarlett O'Hara , but they make good reading so long as they move fast , if it be only from one improbability to the next . A true romantic hero in all respects but this , Aaron Kane suffers from a lack of buoyancy , lands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , paralyzed and pensive , like an actor who has missed his cue .
