txt Senator Borah of Idaho proposed today that the Senate , before resuming its court fight , join the House in overriding President Roosevelt 's veto of low intrest rates on Federal farm loans . He served notice that he would try to get action when the Senate reconvenes Tuesday . Meanwhile , Senator Byrd of Virginia prepared to lead opposition to quick action on the administration 's plan to reorganize the executive branch of the government . An advocate of greater economy than the present bill entails , he said that he would demand full public hearings , adding that it would take several months " to explore the subject adequately . " The death of Majority Leader Robinson , some legislators said today , had weakened chances that the bill would pass at this session . Mr. Robinson was almost the only member of the Senate Reorganization 1Committee , they said , to take an active part in pushing the revised version of the measure which he introduced shortly before his death . Party Caucus Due Wednesday On Wednesday the Senate Democrats are slated to hold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ majority leader . " The farmers are not yet out of the depression by any means , " Mr. Borah asserted in a statement of his intentions today . Disregarding Mr. Roosevelt 's contention that there is " no justification " for " subsidy " interest rates of 31/2 or 4 per cent on nearly $3,000,000,000 of loans to farmers , the House voted last Tuesday , 260 to 98 , to override the veto . " It seems to be overlooked , " Mr. Borah said , " that if this bill does not pass , these farmers  --  many of them  --  will have to go back to the old contract interest rate , which is not 4 per cent as is so often said . " Many of the loans are at 5 per cent , some of them at 51/2 per cent , and some are as high as 6 per cent . The government is borrowing money at as low as 21/2 per cent .

" Had Large Majorities Last Month The controverted measure went through both branches by big margins last month . It provides for continuing for another year the existing 31/2 per cent " emergency " rate on approximately $2,000,000,000 of Federal Land Bank ' loans . A 4 per cent rate then would apply for one year . In addition it would cut from 5 to 4 per cent the rate on about $833 , - 000,000 of Land Bank Commissioner loans , largely secured by second mortgages . President Roosevelt said in his veto message that . the proposals would cost the Treasury about $40 , - 000,000 in the present fiscal year , at a time when he is trying to balance the budget . By The Associated Press . LITTLE ROCK , Ark. , July 18. -1 Governor Carl E. Bailey of Arkan- sas turned away from the funeral of Senator Robinson today to find himself the center of a national political struggle . In his hands lies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leader  --  an appointment which might prove decisive in the deadlocked Senate fight over the President 's Court Bill . Both administration leaders and foes of the court reorganization measure conceded that the Senate was almost evenly divided over that bitterly fought issue , and that one vote might conceivably swing the victory to either side . Mr. Bailey 's appointee to the Senate also might play a crucial role in the fight over the Senate Democratic leadership , almost as hotly contested as the court controversy . Half a dozen Democratic Senators and White House aides , who accompanied Mr. Robinson 's body to Arkansas for burial , conferred discreetly today with Mr. Bailey or his friends over the appointment . They said privately that the Governor preferred to leave Mr. Robinson 's seat vacant until a special election could be held , probably about Sept. 14 . Administration spokesmen vigorously opposed this course . They argued that both the Court Bill and the leadership might be put to a vote within the next week , and that a Senator friendly to the President 's program should be named immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , several informed Senators said that they expected Mr. Bailey to make the appointment within the next few days . . His nominee would serve , however , only until the special election , in which Mr. Bailey himself is expected to be a leading candidate . Prominently mentioned for the interim appointment was Brooks Hays , Democratic national committeeman for Arkansas and attorney for the Resettlement Administration . Mrs. Robinson also was discussed for the post by some Senators and Arkansas friends , but they said that she probably would be reluctant to accept . Mr. Hays is a close friend of the Governor and is known to be an enthusiastic supporter of the Court Bill . Like Mr. Bailey , he has long been friendly to the New Deal . He has told friends he would support Senator Barkley of Kentucky in the leadership fight . Mr. Barkley has the backing of most Senators favoring the court bill , while opponents of the legislation have lined up almost solidly behind Senator Harrison of Mississippi . There was little discussion of either the court or leadership controversies among the Congressional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ceremonies . Vice President John N. Garner , who came here from his home at Uvalde , Texas , boarded the special Congressional train tonight for Washington with the delegation of Senators and Representatives . He made no public comment on the situation resulting from Senator Robinson 's death . His return to Washington terminated a five weeks ' stay in ' Uvalde , where he had been resting and attending to personal business .
