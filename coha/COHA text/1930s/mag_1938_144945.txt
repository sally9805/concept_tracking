The Supreme Sacred Congregation of the Holy Office is the awesome tribunal of the Roman Catholic Church which guards the integrity of Catholic faith &; morals , deals with heresies ( it once had charge of the Inquisition ) , handles mixed marriage cases , maintains the dread Index of Prohibited Books . So potent is the Holy Office that it is nominally headed , not by a Cardinal , like other congregations , but by the Pope himself . Last week the Holy Office-with or without the knowledge of Pope Pius XI-was in the centre of a holy row , kicked up by a devoted but backboned British convert to Catholicism , Poet Alfred Noyes . <P> Two years ago Alfred Noyes , a Catholic of eleven years ' standing , wrote an able biography , Voltaire , published in the U. S. and England by Sheed &; Ward , a distinguished Catholic firm . Author Noyes made no attempt to whitewash the corruptions , ecclesiastical and otherwise , of Voltaire 's time ; he agreed with Voltaire 's observation that " to receive the Host from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Author Noyes did aim , however , to prove by Voltaire 's own statements that he was by no means the cynical atheist he is commonly considered ; that he was , in fact , a Deist without quite enough insight to become a full Christian . Voltaire , thought its author , presented an " overwhelming " case for Christianity . The Holy Office , when it read the book last spring , thought otherwise . Its secretary , Donatus Cardinal Sbarretti , wrote Arthur Cardinal Kinsley , Archbishop of Westminster , that the Holy Office decreed : <P> " That the author be informed that the book be found worthy of condemnation by the Holy Office , but that such could be avoided if he removes , as far as he is able , all copies from circulation , and at the same time writes something that will be equivalent to a reparation . That the publishers be severely warned for having published the book , and that they withdraw it from sale . " <P> Sheed &; Ward , mindful of their Catholic public , withdrew Voltaire from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which had ready a translation of the book , held up publication . Meanwhile , Author Noyes sought to learn why the Holy Office thought Voltaire worthy of condemnation . He was informed that he would be told only if he would write the Holy Office a letter which , by implication , would acknowledge his errors . Unwilling to make any such blind recantation , Author Noyes did what Englishmen often do when highly irritated . He appealed to the London Times , which last fortnight printed the documents of the case , including the Holy Office letter . Others : <P> Letter from Mr. Noyes to Cardinal Hinsley : " So far as I know , it is the first time in history that any English writer of any standing , or indeed any English writer who in his work-whatever his personal failures may be-has reverenced ' conscience as his king . ' has had such an order addressed to him in such terms . " <P> Letter from Cardinal Hinsley to the Times : " I have carefully read Mr. Noyes 's book , Voltaire , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ position to say that there has been no condemnation , and certainly not from the Pope . There is question only of some emendments , the nature of which will be discussed later with the author and myself . "
