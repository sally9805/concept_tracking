High over the silver Hudson , in uptown Manhattan , stands a giant 's village of towering , cream-brick buildings : Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center. * Most extraordinary of the hospitals in this doctors ' Mecca is the 14-story Neurological Institute , erected ten years ago through the heroic efforts of late , great Neurologist Frederick Tilney . Last year , after wielding an influence among devoted young neurologists second only to that of famed Harvey Gushing ( see p. 60 ) , Dr. Tilney died . As acting director , the trustees appointed modest Dr. Robert Frederick Loeb . Last week , warmhearted , diplomatic Tracy Putnam came down from Harvard to take Dr. Tilney 's place . <P> He came to no workaday hospital , devoted to textbook treatment of disease , but to a great temple of experiment , where even sober trustees are fired by the high task of ending body 's tyranny over mind , To 45-year-old Dr. Putnam , as to the other bold , competent physicians in the Institute , the study of brain processes and the treatment of brain ills is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ detours of nerve paths and battles of brain cells , he knows that a long chain of simple injections , or the sharp bite of a surgeon 's knife into grey brain flesh may miraculously humanize a speechless paralytic , a savage child , a cancer victim crazy with pain . <P> Within a year , Dr. Putnam hopes to use the magnificent resources of the Institute for large scale clinical work in 1 ) multiple sclerosis , a mysterious nerve-crippling disease , probably twice as prevalent as infantile paralysis ; 2 ) paralysis agitans , a lingering , incurable shaking palsy ; 3 ) epilepsy ( known to modernists as " convulsions " ) . Meanwhile , within the cheerful green walls of the Institute , turbanned patients continue to wheel their chairs through sunny wards , as 100 experimenters work on problems such as mirror-writing , abnormalities of the senses , hydrocephalus ( water-on-the-brain ) , brain physiology and anatomy . <P> Brain Waves . Chief of the Institute 's brain-wave station is young , German-born Dr. Paul Frederick Adam Hoefer , who came from Boston with Dr. Putnam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ electroencephalograph . Tiny lead electrodes are pasted to the patient 's scalp . From the electrodes fine , threadlike wires lead to the machine which detects , through scalp and skull , faint electric brain impulses . A connected drum and ink recorder charts patterns . Normal frequency is ten shallow , rippling , regular waves a second . Abnormal brain waves , often running to 25 a second , show up as irregular plateaus , spikes or scallops . Skilled interpreters can read characteristic abnormal wave patterns as indications of approaching epilepsy , can even use them to locate surface brain tumors . Typical epilepsy pattern looks very much like a string of trylons and perispheres . <P> Remarkably sensitive to aerial noises , the electroencephalograph , while attached to a patient 's head , may sometimes pick up short-wave radio programs . Classic is the accident which happened to famed British Neurologist Edgar Douglas Adrian , who once hitched an amplifier to a brain recorder , for a wholesale broadcast of brain waves to an auditorium full of his colleagues . To his horror the electroencephalograph blared out God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rose , half remained seated .
