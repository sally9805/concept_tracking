In romantic Venice , the year 's largest crop of illegitimate Italians is always born in March , thanks to the annual festive " Hymen Harvest " duly celebrated last week . For this occasion Il Duce 's ban against kissing in public , which is punished with a fine of 10 lira ( 80 ) was suspended for the night . After filing in a long sacred procession through the Church of Il Redentore , some 10,000 Venetian youths and maidens of the rabble rowed out to the Lido in the year 's greatest gondola fleet , slept on the beach under the moon , returned to Venice next morning . To bambini born of this Hymen Harvest , mellow Venetians give the name " Moon Children . "
