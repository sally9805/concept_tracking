To their sewers few city dwellers give a second thought , so basic and taken-for-granted is sewage disposal in urban life . New York City 's sewers spout 1,107,000,000 gallons every 24 hours . Chicago 's daily 800,000,000 gallons would make a 100-acre lake 40 ft. deep . There is a mile of sewers for every 1,000 persons in the U. S. Even a half-hour suspension of sewage disposal might cripple city existence , but who cares ? <P> Last week in Milwaukee a Federal District Court judge signed his name to an opinion in accounting proceedings in some patent infringement suits which brought sewage disposal smack into the dinner-table conversation of every taxpayer in the city . To Activated Sludge , Inc. , which had sued the City of Milwaukee , its Sewerage Commission and several contractors for using its patented method of treating sewage and certain patented apparatus used for this purpose without license , Judge Ferdinand A. Geiger awarded profits and damages of $4,977,000 , the equivalent of a $6 tax increase for each $1,000 of real and personal property value on ' Milwaukee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that fortnight ago a favorable decision in a similar patent infringement suit against Chicago 's Sanitary.District was upheld in the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals . Activated Sludge 's compensation in that case may make Milwaukee 's payment look like small change . All patents which Activated Sludge controlled in the U. S. have now run out their 17 years , but the company still has suits pending against New York City , Fort Worth . Tex . and nearly 100 other cities . Back royalties and settlements secured since 1934 include : Cleveland $85,000 , Houston $75,000 , Indianapolis $73,000 . San Antonio $58,000 , Columbus $40,000 , Peoria $23,000 , Cuba , Mo . $80 . <P> Poignantly for Milwaukee 's taxpayers , Milwaukee might once have purchased rights to the Activated Sludge patents for $25,000 but preferred to gamble on their validity . The process was originally suggested at the Lawrence Experimental Station in Massachusetts in 1890 . Further experiments were carried on in Manchester , England . About 1914 patents on the process were taken out in England and elsewhere by a British foundryman named @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ died in 1922 . An American named Edgar C. Guthard , the U. S. licensee , and Activated Sludge , Ltd. sued Chicago 's Sanitary District in 1924 for patent infringements . In 1927 Guthard formed Activated Sludge , Inc. and it joined in the U. S. lawsuits . Milwaukee was sued in 1928 and Activated Sludge won its first decision in 1933 against that city when its patents were held valid . President of Activated Sludge , Inc. , is one Carl W. Johnson . Large in the sludge pie is the finger of wealthy Chicago Patent Lawyer Lynn A. Williams who was recently the successful defendant of a damage suit brought by a beach-loving fellow lawyer ( TIME . June 21 ) . Besides being a Sludge stockholder . Attorney Williams ' firm of Williams , Bradbury , McCaleb &; Hinkle is handling the sludge lawsuits , was estimated prior to last week 's award to have secured for Activated Sludge some $630,000.
