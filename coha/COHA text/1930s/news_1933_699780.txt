txt After consideration of the taxation features of the administration 's industrial control and public works bill , President Roosevelt has decided that the sales tax will be the least oppressive way of raising the $220 , - 000,000 necessary for the interest and amortization of the $3,300,000 , - 000 in bonds to be issued for public works projects . This conclusion is said to have been reached by the President after some leaders in Congress had urged an increase in the income taxes . He will send a message to Congress Wednesday transmitting the administration 's bill in which he will make his taxation recommendations . The exact amount of the sales tax will not be determined by the President , it was said tonight , until he receives reports from the actuary of the Treasury as to how heavy a tax will be necessary to raise the estimated revenue to cover the interest and amortization charges on the gigantic bond issue . Upon his return tonight from a cruise down the Potomac River , it was said in behalf of the President that he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislation and that this would delay his message until the middle of this week . Secretaries Accompany Him . Taking the final draft of the measure with him . President Roosevelt departed just before noon on his cruise . With him were Louis Howe , Stephen J. Early of his secretarial force , and several others . Injection of this bill into the deliberations of Congress may prolong the session beyond the second week in June , the goal set by the leaders for the adjournment of the extra session . Some of the administration 's foremost legislative recommendations are still before Congress , the most difficult of solution being the bills on railroad control , home loan legislation and the Glass banking measure . An enormous amount of work reMains to be disposed of before adjournment , and some of the Congressional leaders are not very hopeful of leaving Washington until late in June unless controversial legislation is sidetracked until the regular session next January . Long Debate on Rail Bill Likely . According to the Senate leaders , the opposition of labor to the railroad control bill will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably longer . If the Glass banking measure is reported to the Senate this week it will add another obstacle to early adjournment , as the Senate will insist on a thorough discussion of the proposals , which are not acceptable to many Democrats , as well as Republicans . It was the opinion of some of the majority Senate leaders tonight that the Glass bill would go over until the regular session unless the President makes it a part of his program . ; Thus far he has not indicated his position on this legislation . If the President asks for authority to deal with the tariff and the war debts during the recess of Congress , the leaders say , there will be such opposition even in his own party , as to cause a bitter and prolonged debate . Democratic leaden ' assent that the President de ; area to have the domestic program completed and Congress out of the ? way by mid-June so that he can de:vote himself to a consideration of the questions before the World Economic Conference at London . While the administration 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask for leg- islation on the debts , it is believed by many observers that developments in Europe will force him to 1d so if he hopes to assure progress on tariffs and other matters of American concern before the conference . According to Treasury officials , the budget for the next fiscal year , calling for $2,200,000,000 , does not take into consideration the payment , by the debtor nations of $329,000,000 due to the United States in the coming year in interest and principay . The failure to include in the budget payments of interest is interpreted by some as meaning that 1 the President will either ask for a moratorium on the June 15 debt payments , or as an admission by Treasury officials that the interest 1 and principal charges in the next fiscal year will not be met . While the Senate and House are waiting for the major legislation such as the railroad control bill still before committees , there is nothing of immediate importance on the calendars of either house . The home mortgage refinancing bill , which has passed the House , is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ independent offices bill , which will be received from the House tomorrow , will be referred to the appropriations committee . Conference reports on the securities regulation and Muscle Shoals bills await action of the Senate , with the probability that the House will adopt the report on I the latter bill tomorrow .
