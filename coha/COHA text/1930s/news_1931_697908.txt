txt A STUDENT of International affairs in Geneva writes to The Chi istian Science Monitor as follows on the present economic condition of Germany . " During the past week I have had opportunity to talk with Germans of every school of political opinion , journalists , delegates and the like , and they all agree that Germany is in a most serious plight . Not to be alarmist , but simply to be clear-headed , I think it must be recognized that the creditor nations must relieve suffering Germany soon . " To a traveler , certain recent German public works  --  shining new buildings , and the like  --  give a totally wrong impression , for , afraid of seeing bank savings vanish , Germans have put their money into tangible things . " The new German millionaires who flaunt themselves blatantly in the de luxe hotels in Paris , on the Riviera , and so forth , are a totally misleading class , and there are really very few of them . Some of them have escaped from Germany , and arc traitors upon whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I feel , after extensive investigation of the subject , that there is not the slightest ground for pleading that Germany has not made the most honest and heartrending attempt to meet its obligations . The claim for another scaling down of reparations is merely the logical amendment of the Young plan ? an arrangement reached in time of relative prosperity  --  to be accurate in a time of economic depression . Therefore , if we are to save Germany from Bolshevism , I am sure we have got to act and act quickly . By next winter it may be too late . " By heroic efforts Germany may save herself , but mere foresight  --  to save the vast sums of American money invested in Germany since the war  --  compels us to be generous . Germany must be rescued from events which one finds unpleasant to think about . "
