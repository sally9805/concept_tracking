txt The commanding officers do hope it wo n't make softies of Chicago 's firemen . But just the same , Fire Commissioner Michael J. Corrigan has asked for enclosed fire trucks , so that his men can ride in comfort when it 's raining or snowing . Fighting fires wo n't be any softer , he says , but getting to them will . About the firemen , he is n't sure . Corrigan said yesterday he has asked for six new pumper trucks and six new , tractors to pull hook and ladder equipment . The tractors will have enclosed cabs for the driver and commanding officer . The pumper trucks , - though , will have enclosed cabs and an enclosed section for six men behind the cabs . Anthony J. Mullaney , first deputy marshal , does n't think the men will get soft . If he knows them , he says , they 'll all be out on the last section of the trucks , which will be open , because firemen just do n't like things too easy .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
