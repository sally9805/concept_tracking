Harlem 's hotspots last week had 45 knowing visitors . The 45 were delegates to the American Musicological Society 's first international congress , climaxing a strenuous six-day program in Manhattan . Such eminent musicologists as Yugoslavia 's Dragan Plamenac , Denmark 's Knud Jeppesen , Venezuela 's Juan Lecuna , watched the Big Apple , the Lindy Hop , the Shag , drank what there was to drink . At the Savoy Ballroom , Bandmaster Erskine Hawkins swung Bach , Rachmaninoff 's Prelude in C Minor in their honor . The bolder musicologists ventured gingerly out on the floor , soon got limber . <P> Before its Harlem junket , last week 's congress had its fill of erudition . The musicologists , whose line is musical research as opposed to musical performance , heard such typical papers as The So-Called Babylonian Notation , Mozart 's Handwriting and the Creative Process , The Evolution of Javanese Tone-Systems . Delegates from France and Germany were kept away by the war , and the musicologists soberly discussed probable hindrance of their work elsewhere , applauded a message from French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , there is not . . . any rivalry among nations . The only combat worthy of us is that . . . between culture and ignorance . " <P> It was not all theory the delegates heard : a dozen concerts ranged in theme from music of the two Americas to Venetian and Dalmatian songs of the Renaissance . One program resurrected unpublished music by Handel , none of it performed since the composer 's day . Enjoyed most by delegates and outsiders alike was a concert of medieval music at The Cloisters , Manhattan 's museum-piece museum of Gothic art , where bull-necked French Tenor Yves Tinayre and a girls ' choir sang motets , trouvere songs , Gregorian chants . <P> Leader of the Harlem jaunt , as of the entire congress , was tweedy , affable , red-mustached Carleton Sprague Smith , * 34 , president of the American Musicological Society . Dr. Smith once studied the flute at the Paris Conservatoire , decided professional flute playing was too uncertain a job , though he had worked his way through Harvard by fluting at weddings , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York Public Library 's music division , a clearing house for musical information used yearly by 50,000 people , from schoolgirls to Cecil B. DeMille . <P> Dr. Smith 's outlook on music is sociological , stems from his interest in people , their customs and living conditions . In no slumming or night-out spirit did he shepherd his fellows to Harlem . He says of U. S. folk music : " It 's the best thing we have . It 's as American as chewing gum and Mark Twain , good and tawdry and proud of it . " <P> <P> * No kin to Musicologist Carleton Smith , radio commentator at Manhattan 's Lewisohn Stadium concerts .
