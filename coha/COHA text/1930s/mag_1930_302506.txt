Ganna Walska d'Eighnhorn Fraenkel Cochran McCormick , assertive Polish second wife of Chicago 's harvester tycoon , Harold Fowler McCormick , has three passions : Music , Perfume , Feminism . For Music she has labored many a weary year without spectacular success . For Perfume , she has founded and guided to success Ganna Walska Perfumes , Inc. , of Paris and New York .

Cline , only woman member of the court , first woman appointee in the Federal judiciary . In a separate opinion she objected to the court 's implication that a separate domicile was to be taken as an exception , not as an accepted rule : ' ' . . . I can discern no reason why they wives should not have equal rights as to the selection of a domicile . . . . The common law has been practically expunged. "      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
