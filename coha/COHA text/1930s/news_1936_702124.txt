At the Pan American Airways terminal here a crowd of nearly 1,000 gathered to watch for the plane soon after 4 o'clock . New York City was represented by First Deputy Police Commissioner Harold Fowler . Coast Guard boats patrolled the busy waters of the bay , keeping yachts , rowboats and launches well clear of the landing area , while policemen held the crowd off the ramp leading to the big hangar . At 6:15 o'clock the heavy roar of the Zephyr 's two Diesel engines was heard and a moment later the big plane soared across the harbor .

The catapult is powerful enough to move their 20,000-pound bulk from a stand-still to 100 miles an hour in 100 feet . They have a wing span of 78 feet and carry a useful load of more than 7,000 pounds . Their motors , rigged in tandem on top of the monoplane wing , are Junkers Diesel engines , using heavy oil for fuel . They develop 500 horsepower each . The front motor drives a tractor air screw , and - the rear motor turns a propeller . Captain Blakenburg and the other members of the crew are staying at the Hotel Savoy-Plaza . Baron von Gablenz was met by relatives and went to their home in Greenwich . where the Pan American terminal is actually situated .

" A routine flight , " he said . " The flight in itself was nothing , an every-day event . I am glad to say , however , that we had about everything the ocean could offer in the way of weather . We had head winds , tail winds , - cross- winds . " We had clouds and fog and clear weather and several squalls . We also flew through a thunderstorm , and we averaged 110 miles an hour for the flight . " The radio , the engines , all the equipment worked perfectly , Captain Blankenburg said .

The radio man picked up the Europa and two hours later they spied her smoke on the horizon as the big liner headed toward New York . " We flew over her at 11:15 and saluted her and got another weather report , " Captain Blankenburg said . " Then we came on . " At 1 P. M. , New York time , the Zephyr flashed her position as 42.10 north-61.44 west and estimated her arrival time as 7 P. M. , New York time . But the helping winds increased and the plane flew faster . For a time the radio was silent here . Captain Blankenburg , to test his radio range , turned to the Schwabenland and continued to talk to the mother ship for the rest of the flight , save for a brief message just before 5 o'clock , saying he was flying over Nantucket .
