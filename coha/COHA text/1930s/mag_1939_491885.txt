I realized afterward it was not the fact of leaving the watch but that . ho did not want to relax the tight hold he was keeping on himself . I had been sleeping fitfully , getting up every hour or so to see how my husband was . It was so on this night . At five or six in the morning I found him still sleeping normally , as it appeared . Relieved , I dozed off again until after eight . This time I found him sitting on the side of the bed , trying to reach a water bottle . As I handed it to him I noticed that his left hand hung loosely . " I have no feeling in that hand , " he said . " Will you rub it ? But first help me to the bathroom . " He moved with great difficulty , and every move brought spasms of pain , but with my help he gained the bathroom . This so alarmed me that I asked if I could leave long enough to telephone the doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Doctor Grayson . While at the phone I heard a slight noise and , rushing into my husband 's apartment , I found him on the bathroom floor , unconscious . My first thought was to keep him warm . From his bed I snatched a blanket , and while I was arranging it over him he stirred and asked for a drink of water . I got it , and also got a pillow for his head . I did these things automatically , for I was utterly devoid of feeling . I had a curious sensation of having lived through this very thing before  --  and so knew how to act , and act quickly . I seemed to know just what the doctor would say to my husband and he to the doctor . Following the Doctors ' Orders T HEN came a knock on the door . It was locked ; the President and I always locked our doors leading into the hall , leaving only our communicating door unlocked . The knock was Grayson 's . We lifted the President into his bed . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his body . An arm and one leg were useless , but , thank God , the brain was clear and untouched . Such is the story of that tragic morning hour of October 2,1919 , as my memory presents it to me . As far as was possible , I checked my recollections with the data of Doctor Grayson , before his lamented death in 1938 . I did this because of a rather remarkable account of the same events which appears in the posthumously published " diary " of Mr. I. H. Hoover , the White House head usher . For example , the late Mr. Hoover is represented as seeing a long cut on the President 's temple , which , late that afternoon , still showed signs of blood ; also a cut lengthwise of the nose . Doctor Grayson and I did not see these things . As I recall , not even a bruise resulted from the President 's fall . The fact is that he had just slid sidewise to the floor from a sitting position . Nurses came and the house was organized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great nerve specialist of Philadelphia , Dr. Sterling Ruffin. and Admiral E. R. Stitt , of the Naval Medical Corps , were summoned . Margaret . and Nell were called to Washington by telephone . For days life hung in the balance . Then the will to live , to recover and tight on for his League of Nations , almost imperceptibly at first , began to gain ascendancy , and the President got a little better . Once my husband was out of immediate danger , the burning question was how Mr , Wilson might best serve the country , preserve his own life and , if possible , recover . Many people , among them some I had counted as friends , have written of my overwhelming ambition to act as President ; of my exclusion of all advice , and so forth . I am trying here to write as though I had taken the oath to tell the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so help me God . I asked the doctors to he frank with me ; that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to be honest with the people . They all said that , as the brain was as clear as ever , with the progress made in the past few days , there was every reason to think recovery possible . Doctor Dercum told me of the history of Pasteur , who had been stricken exactly in this way , but who recovered and did his most brilliant intellectual work afterward . He sent me a copy of a remarkable book , The Life of Pasteur . But recovery could not be hoped for , they said , unless the President was released from every disturbing problem during these days of Nature 's effort to repair the damage done . " How can that be , " I asked the doctors , " when everything that comes to an executive is a problem ? How can I protect him from them when the country looks to the President as the leader ? " Doctor Dercum leaned toward me and said : " Madam , it is a grave situation , but I think you can solve it . Have everything come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and see if it is possible , by consultations with the respective heads of each Department , to solve them without the guidance of your husband . In this way you can save him a great deal . But . always keep in mind that every time you take him a new anxiety or problem to excite him , you are turning a knife in an open wound . His nerves are crying out for rest , and any excitement is torture to him . " " Then , ' ' I said , " had he better not resign , let Mr. Marshall succeed to the presidency , and let my husband get that complete rest that is so vital to his life ? " " No , " the doctor said , " not if you feel equal to what I suggested . For Mr. Wilson to resign would have a bad effect on the country , and a serious effect on our patient . He has staked his life and made his promise to do all in his power to ratify the treaty and make the League of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recovery is gone ; and as his mind is clear as crystal , he can still do more with even a maimed body than anyone else . He has the utmost confidence in you . Doctor Grayson tells me he has always discussed public affairs with you , so you will not come to them uninformed . " So began my stewardship . I studied every paper , sent for the different secretaries or senators , and tried to digest and present in tabloid form the things that , despite my vigilance , had to go to the President . I , myself , never made a single decision regarding the disposition of public affairs . The only decision that was mine was what was important and what was not , and the very important decision of when to present them to my husband . He asked thousands of questions , and insisted upon knowing everything , particularly about the treaty . He would dictate notes to me to send to Senator Hitchcock , who was leading the fight for the treaty in the Senate . Or he would tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had to make to them . These directions I made notes of , so , in transmitting his views , I should make no mistake ; and I would read them to him before going to the interviews . This method of handling interviews was another suggestion of the doctors . It is always an excitement for one who is ill to see people . The physicians said that if I could convey the messages of Cabinet members and others to the President , he would escape the nervous drain that audiences with these officials would entail . Even the necessary little courteous personal conversations that go with an official interview would consume the President 's strength . dl Stricken Leader T HESE instructions from the medical men were far from easy to carry out . Picture the situation when my husband was stricken : his tour a success ; public sentiment , which had been worked upon incessantly by the enemies of the League , once more responding to Mr. Wilson 's logic ; the initiative again in the hands of friends of the treaty ; Mr. Hitchcock and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then the President laid low , ruled out of the fight , which he would have continued though he knew it would cost him his life . Upon all sides I was literally besieged by those who " must " see the President . But I carried out the directions of the doctors , and my heart was in it . Woodrow Wilson was first my beloved ( Continued on Page 59 ) husband , whose life I was trying to save , fighting with my back to the wall ; after that he was the President of the United States . In that other battle , in the Senate , the first victory was for the treaty 's friends . A series of crippling amendtn en ts , called the Lodge and Fall amendments , had been introduced . They were defeated  --  all the friends of the treaty , Democrats and Republicans , voting together . Then Mr. Lodge dropped the word " amendment " and began the gradual introduction of " reservations , " until a whole stack of them were before the Senate . The difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appearance , and the original Lodge-Fall amendments was the difference between tweedledum and tweedledee . A workable system of handling matters of state had scarcely been evolved when a terrible complication interrupted the progress of our patient . A stricture occurred , blocking elimination from the bladder . Its continuance meant death . A consultation of specialists was called  --  Dr. Hugh Young , of Johns Hopkins ; Dr. H. A. Fowler , of Washington ; Doctor Dercum , Doctor " Ruffin , Doctor Stitt and Doctor Grayson . It was the seventeenth clay of October . After an unsuccessful attempt to relieve the patient by means of local applications , the doctors retired to come to a final decision . As I waited by the bedside , I longed for and yet dreaded their return . At length Doctor Grayson beckoned me to the door . I went into my room , finding him so overcome that he could not speak at first . We stood at the window , looking over the green lawn and on toward the towering Washington Monument , neither seeing anything Finally the doctor said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no alternative but an operation , and I feel sure the President ca n't stand one . Since we came to this conclusion I went out and walked around the block , trying to get myself together before coining to you . This is the situation : Doctors Young and Fowler , who are specialists , agree that this condition can not be relieved without an operation . I think the others are of the same opinion . I feel an operation will be the end . Therefore , while I hate to put the responsibility on you , there is nothing else but for you to decide . " R Life In My Hands I felt that another chasm had opened at my feet , and that this time I should not know how to bridge it . Automatically I spoke : " Then we will not operate . You know more than anyone else of the real chances of recovery . So go down and tell them I feel that Nature will finally take care of things , and we will wait . " In a moment Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt that if I understood I would see things differently . Doctor Young followed me into my dressing room and , taking pencil and paper from his pocket , he proceeded to draw diagrams which my blinded eyes could hardly see . His arguments were supplemented by Doctor Ruffin , my personal physician long before I met Mr. Wilson , and by Doctor Dercum . But something kept me steady and I would not agree . Perhaps all this took only minutes , but it seemed hours to me . Finally the nurse came to say that the President was asking for me . When I rose to go , Doctor Young called after me : " You understand , Mrs. Wilson , the whole body will become poisoned if this condition lasts an hour , or , at the most , two hours longer . " With this note ringing in my ear like the tolling of a funeral bell , I went back to the sickroom . No matter what he was suffering , my coming was always greeted with a smile , and the thin hand would reach @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching the coming and going of the nurses , the visits of the doctors , but with every fiber of my being noting the fast moving of the hands of the clock . My own life seemed suspended ; even Nature herself seemed listening , for there was not a sound outside . The temperature and respiration were taken at frequent intervals , and each time the former got a little higher . Local treatments were again applied . The two hours had gone by and we were well into the third when , suddenly , the tense condition relaxed and Nature again asserted her power over disease . The temperature receded and the weary patient slept . The doctors went home to rest , and again peace deScended upon my spirit . The Belgian Visit This crisis proved a serious setback , however , taking much of my husband 's vitality . Patiently we went to work to build him up again . Our patient improved so that on October thirtieth we could receive informally the King and Queen of the Belgians , who had been on the ocean when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behaved exactly as would a considerate friend who found himself inadvertently in a house of sickness . A ceremonial tour of the country was abandoned and the King and Queen contented themselves with visiting , incognito , some of the things they wished most to see . When Mr. Wilson had recovered somewhat from his setback , they came to Washington . Through the State Department , Mr. and Mrs. Breckinridge Long placed their home at the disposal of the visitors . Vice-President and Mrs. Marshall did the official entertaining . We had flowers sent with a note of welcome , and I went immediately to call upon Her Majesty , finding her the same gracious , sympathetic woman I had learned to admire a few short months before . I asked them to come for a cup of tea , when I hoped the President would be able to greet the King in his own room . They came the following afternoon , with only their young son , the prince . and two aides . We had tea in the Red Room . When it was over , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my husband was waiting to receive him . I excused myself to the Queen , but she , with all the naivete of a girl , said : " Oh , but he must not go yet . We have a present for the President , but in spite of all our care it has never come , and we must wait here until it does , so we can present it ourselves , " She then explained that on their arrival in New York she wanted to bring ( Continued from Pug . 59 ) " the box " with their personal bags , but was persuaded to let it come with the big luggage . In some way it had been overlooked and she was desolated , but nothing would persuade her to let the King go up until " the box " came . Finally the head usher announced its arrival . Two men brought in and set carefully down a beautifully made box of polished wood . When the box was opened with a key , it revealed a case lined with crimson velvet and containing three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a hand-painted representation of a historic place in Belgium  --  some of which had been destroyed during the war  --  each framed in an identical border of rich black and gold . The back of every plate born an inscription to Mr. Wilson . Truly it was a royal gift and one that gave us lasting pleasure . After I had tried to express my gratitude , His Majesty said he would like to go upstairs . I asked if he wanted the plates to go , and he said he would like it - very much . My husband was ready to receive him , and the King was as gentle as a woman in his sincere sympathy and solicitude . After a tour of the White House , the Queen said she must go up to see the President , for she wanted her son , the prince , to know him . There was no gainsaying her request . Of course , my husband had put on his dressing gown to receive the King . But a gown was clumsy and uncomfortable when lying in bed , and so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweater he had bought years before in Scotland , and which was the joy and comfort of his life . When I took the party into his room , he apologized for the sweater and assured them had he known he was to be so honored by Her Majesty he would have worn his gown . She was such an understanding person , one could not feel embarrassed in her presence . And she was so pleased because we found him surrounded by the beautiful china they had given him , studying the details with a large magnifying glass . The Prince of Wales Calls When we left his room I escorted them to the front door , where we found the usual flock of newspaper reporters waiting to ask questions . The Queen laughingly told them of her unannounced call on the President , and said he had made himself comfortable in a , worn Scotch wool sweater . The next day a long account came out in the papers , quoting what she said : only using the word " torn " instead of " worn . " By @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ladies telling me how shameful it was for me to allow the President to wear a torn sweater ; that I could at least mend it ; and some of the dear old souls even sent me gray wool to darn it with . The Prince of Wales visited Washington a fortnight later . I saw him twice  --  when ho came to tea . with me , and again when he came to say his formal adieux . He was ton minutes late to tea , but said he knew I would forgive him when he told me the reason . He was returning by motor from Mount Vernon and " a. vary charming young lady . " stopped him to present some flowers , and of course ho had to pause a few minutes to express his appreciation properly . I took him upstairs to see the President . At first he seemed as embarrassed as many another young boy would have been to go to see an older man in his room . He sat beside the great bed , nervously pleating his trousers . My husband recalled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the visit of our caller 's grandfather , King Edward , to the White House when he was Prince of Wales . The boy left off his nervous gestures and I knew he had forgotten himself . Mr. Wilson told him the bed he occupied was said by some to have been made especially for King Edward ; others , however , claimed it was made for Lincoln . But all agreed that the King had slept in it and , after a busy official day , had arisen one night and slipped out by the window to go to a dance which was not on his official program . This captured the Prince 's imagination and , springing up , he moved quickly to the window , saying : " Do you think it was this window , sir ? " When he arose to go , all embarrassment had left him . In a courtly , easy way he made his adieux and was again the representative of one government addressing the head of another . All this time the fight for the reservations to the Covenant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ executive leadership because of the illness of my husband , friends of the treaty were on the defensive . The ground gained on the Western tour had been gradually lost , until things were worse than when he started . Friends , including such a valued and persuasive friend as Mr. Bernard M. Baruch , begged Mr. Wilson to accept a compromise , saying , " Half a loaf is better than no bread . " I can not be unsympathetic with them , for in a moment of weakness I did the same . In my anxiety for the one I loved best in the world , the long-drawn-out fight was eating into my very soul , and I felt nothing mattered hut to get the treaty ratified , even with those reservations . On November nineteenth the Senate was to vote on the reservations . Senator Hitchcock came to tell me that unless the Administration forces accepted them , the treaty would be beaten  --  the struggle having narrowed down to a personal fight against the President by Lodge and his supporters . In desperation Lwent to my husband @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " wo n't you accept these reservations and get this awful thing settled " He turned his head on the pillow and , stretching out his hand to take mine , answered in a voice I shall never forget : " Little girl , do n't you desert me ; that I can not stand . Ca n't you see that I have no moral right to accept any change in a paper I have signed , without giving to every other signatory , even the Germans , the right to do the same thing ? It is not I that will not accept ; it is the nation 's honor that is at stake . Better a thousand times to go down fighting than to dip your colors to dishonorable compromise . " I felt like one of his betrayers to have ever doubted . Rejoining Senator Hitchcock outside , I told him that for the first time I had seen the thing clearly , and I would never ask my husband again to do what would be manifestly dishonorable . When I went back to the President 's room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " In my opinion , the resolution in that form does not provide for ratification but rather for nullification of the treaty . . . I trust that all true friends of the treaty will refuse to support the Lodge resolution . " That same day the Senate voted . The Administration forces , voting against ratification with the Lodge reservations , defeated it . The vote was then on the ratification of the treaty without reservations  --  the treaty as Mr. Wilson had brought it from France . The result was defeat . When the word came from the Capitol , I felt I could not bear it , and that the shock might be serious for my husband . I went to his bedside and told him the fatal news . For a few moments he was silent , and then he said : " All the more reason I must get well and try again to bring this country to a sense of its great opportunity and greater responsibility . " How like him ! From that moment he accepted the inevitable , turned the page and began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shielding him from visitors had given rise to the myth that the President was insane , or at any rate greatly impaired in mind . Senator Moses , of New Hampshire , gave currency to the story that Mr. Wilson had suffered a brain lesion , which brought the prompt statement from Doctor Grayson that his patient 's mind was " clear as a bell . " Nevertheless , the whispering campaign continued and the statement appeared in print that bars had been placed on the windows of his room . True enough , there were bars on a bedroom window of the White House . But they were not on the windows of the room occupied by the President and they had been placed there , I was told , by Theodore Roosevelt to protect his little children . Two senatorial allies of Mr. Ledge made speeches about the " millions of dollars ' " worth of gifts royalty had showered upon us in Europe . One of these senators , a provincial Westerner of small intelligence , may have actually believed this , but it is difficult to imagine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Even newspapers ardently opposed to Mr. Wilson declined to take stock in such cock-and-bull stories , but the sinister rumor of Mr. Wilson 's mental impairment persisted . Republicans alone were not responsible for the spread of this tale . Mr. Lansing had been the first , as far as I know , to raise the question and to try to force the President . from office . This , of course , was grist for the mill of Mr. Lodge and some of his associates on the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . After the treaty vote in November , some little incident with Mexico developed . Sen. Albert B. Fall engineered a maneuver in the committee by which a subcommittee was named , ostensibly to confer with the President on the Mexican situation . The real object was to see whether the President was mentally capable of administering his office . The subcommittee was composed of Mr. Fall and Mr. Hitchcock . Senator Hitchcock had opposed the whole business , but he consented to accompany Mr. Fall to the White House . Senator Fall entered the room looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in invisible soap and imperceptible water . " He said to my husband : " Well , Mr. President , we have all been praying for you . " " Which way , senator ? " inquired the President , with a chuckle . Mr. Fall laughed as if the witticism , had been his own . I had taken the precaution to carry a pad and pencil , so I would not have to shake hands with him . I sat on the 62 THE SRTU HAIRY EVENING POST February 11 , 11 ) 3b other side of the bed and carefully wrote down every word that passed between them , Finally Senator Fall said : " You seem very much engaged , madam . " " Yes , " I said , " I thought it wise to record this interview , so there may be no misunderstanding or misstatements made . " When the senators rose to leave , Mr. Fall was fulsome in his adieux . Reaching the front door he assured the reporters that the President was mentally fit . and had waved both arms in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left as well as his right side , which , of rousse , was an overstatement of the case , for Mr. Wilson 's left side was nearly useless . When the oil scandals sent Mr. Fall to the penitentiary , I could not but recall that this was the man Mr. Henry Cabot Lodge had delegated to pass on the mentality of Woodrow Wilson . My husband took much to heart the disappointment of not being able to deliver in person his annual message to Congress  --  another " turning of the knife in the wound , " as Doctor Der-cum said . But on the whole he continued to gain , and by Christmas he was able to sit up for a few hours each day in an easy chair . Both the Wilson and the Bolling families were at the house during the holiday season . I did my best to observe the time-honored forms of that holy festival , but it was an effort . The fight for the League and for the treaty was revived in the Senate . The President agreed to certain interpretive changes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who were fighting for the treaty . By this time the Covenant of the League had been ratified by a sufficient number of nations to make the League operative , and Mr. Wilson was accorded the singular honor of issuing the call for the first meeting . This cheered and pleased him very much . He was now able to do more each day , but . I eased things in every way possible and never left him if I could avoid it . In order to insure absolute quiet , the house and grounds remained closed to the public . I got . exercise by walking on the south side of the house , where I could be reached in a moment . if he needed me . Cabinet Changes A nurse can make or mar a house of sickness , and in Miss Ruth Powderly we were fortunate in having one of the most efficient nurses I have ever known . She was with us nearly two years . Other nurses came and went , but the memory of the ministrations of Miss Powderly stands out in sharp contrast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They recalled what has been said of people who come as new officials to Washington : They either grow or swell . By normal standards these were petty annoyances , but a house of sickness can not be judged by normal standards , as everyone knows who has been through the experience . In our case , to have good nurses was as important as to have good Cabinet officers . Two changes in the Cabinet were made during the President 's illness . Mr. Lansing should have retired long before . In Paris he had been a hindrance rather than a help . The same continued after we reached home and my husband was expending the last ounces of his strength for the treaty . As soon as the President became ill , Mr. Lansing started agitating to put his chief out of office . He began calling the heads of other Departments to his office to confer on the direction of public affairs . When at length the President was told of this , lie acted promptly . On February 7 , 1920 , he sent a letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and practice , as developed hitherto , no one but the President has the right to summon the heads of Executive Departments into conference , and no one but the President and the Congress has the right to ask their views or the views of any one of them on any public question . In reply , Mr. Lansing tendered his resignation , which my husband accepted at once , dictating a letter in which he let it appear that the reason was the secretary 's infringement on Executive prerogatives , rather than an accumulation of disloyalties . I begged Mr. Wilson to state both reasons for his acceptance of the proffered resignation , protesting that the letter , as written , made him look small , because , unless people knew , as I did , all the other things he had suffered at Lansing 's hands , the precipitating incident would seem the first offense , whereas it was the last and almost the least of many . At this , my husband laughed : " Well , if I am as big as you think me , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not , I must take the blame . " The other Cabinet officer to retire was Mr. Franklin K. Lane , Secretary of the Interior . Shortly after our return from Europe , Mr. Lane discussed with Mr. Wilson the leasing of certain oil properties . The President did not regard this as a wise thing , and told Mr. Lane a more exhaustive study of the case would have to be made before he could permit any release of Government . property to private capital . While he was first ill , many leases or transfers came to the President 's desk for signature . It was my habit to acquaint myself with the content of each mat ter and put the papers in convenient stacks before carrying them to him for his signature . We would prop him up in bed , and he would sign as many as he could before growing exhausted . The first day I took him one of these oil leases , as I put it before him and explained what it was , he laid it aside and said : " That will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am able to study that situation , do not bring me any more of them , It is better to let things wait than do a thing that to my uninformed judgment seems most unwise . " So insistent did Secretary Lane become when there was no action , that he finally asked me if it . was possible the President was not going to sign them . " I told him just what I have written above , and he became very angry , saying he was responsible for his Department and had gone very carefully into every detail before himself signing the leases , and that he felt the President 's inaction a reflection on him . To this I said : " I am sorry , Mr. Secretary ; but after all , the final responsibility is the President 's , and it is not like him to delegate his responsibility to anyone . " When I look back upon what occurred in the Harding Administration oil scandals , I thank God for my husband 's wisdom . While these were different contracts , applying to different oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been misled . Anyway , on March 1 , 1920 , Mr. Lane sent in his resignation . The atmosphere of cheer and tranquillity which I tried to preserve about the White House was not maintained without strain on some of its inmates . On March fourth my secretary , Edith Benham , fell suddenly ill , and her physician brought me word that she had suffered a complete nervous breakdown . I felt terrible about it . I was so absorbed in my own responsibilities that I did not realize that her heisIth was going . She was never able to come back to me , though , fortunately , she recovered and married her admiral  --  James Helm . For a moment I hardly knew how to do without her , but in those days I had to act , and not think too long about it . Having tackled the first day 's consignment of mail myself , I summoned Mr. McGee , Miss Ben-ham 's typist , and had him copy a. series of form replies 1 had written , numbered 1 , 2 , 3 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not he answered in this way , I would scribble replies in longhand which Mr. McGee copied . It often happened that I did not get at the mail until everyone else except the night nurse was in bed and I almost too weary to hold a pencil . I used to wonder how Mr. McGee ever managed to decipher my notes , but he did . The Death of the Treaty During all this while the treaty was a live issue in the Senate . For a time it seemed as if a number of League Republicans might assert their independence of Mr. Lodge sufficiently to arrive at some sensible basis of compromise . The President endorsed the position of Mr. Hitchcock , who expressed a willingness to yield certain points . In February the Senate voted to reconsider the treaty , but the very next day the Foreign Relations Committee , packed by Mr. Lodge with a majority of opposition members , voted it out with the old Lodge reservations attached . Again the President was urged to give way and accept them . He declined , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ final defeat at the hands of the Senate . Mr. Wilson accepted the news calmly , believing that in the long run history would prove him right and Mr. Lodge wrong . It is hard , even now , for me to be that calm . My conviction is that Mr. Lodge put the world back fifty years , and that at his door lie the wreckage of human hopes and the peril to human lives that afflict mankind today . When the spring opened , we  --  my husband and I  --  spent hours in the garden or on the south portico , enjoying the air and sunlight . Being unable to walk , he was in a wheel chair , and we would take papers and work outdoors . Or if nothing was pressing , I would read aloud to him . The doctors still held to their insistence on no more work than was absolutely necessary . So we resorted to all sorts of devices to fill the hours which for so many years had been crowded with labor . The President 's mind was so active he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moving pictures were a real boon . Producers from all over the country co-operated with Mr. Long , the manager of one of the Washington motion-picture houses , to give a new reel any day if we should want it . Mr. Long himself came to operate a huge lantern that had been presented to the President by Douglas Fairbanks . It seemed as if nearly every Democrat in the country wanted an endorsement from the President , and the demand for personal appointments grew daily . Tumulty was under great pressure , but he , like all of us , strove to protect the President , a particularly hard task for Tumulty ; for politics was breath to his nostrils and he hated turning anyone down . The conventions nominated Harding and Coolidge on the Republican side , James M. Cox and Franklin D. Roosevelt on the Democratic , and the campaign got under way . One day we were on the south portico when , just as the butler appeared with the tray of crackers and milk , Mr. Tumulty ran up the steps waving a paper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hardly wait for the colored butler to leave before he said : " Governor , we 've got ' em beat ! Here is El paper which has been searched out and is absolutely true , showing that Harding has Negro blood in him . This country will never stand for that ! " Fairly bursting with glee , he waved the paper like a ' lag . My husband slowly finished his glass of milk . Then he said firmly : " Even if that is so , it will never be used with my consent . We can not go into a man 's genealogy ; we must base our campaign on principles , not on backstairs gossip . That is not only right but good politics . So I insist you kill any such proposal . " Tumulty wilted . He looked like a little boy caught robbing a bird 's nest . A. few days later Governor Cox and Mr. Roosevelt called and we kept them to lunch . When my husband referred to the above episode and gave them his reaction , I think both gentlemen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ favor of the League of Nations that he cheered my husband greatly , saying he wanted to make the issue stand out in his campaign . Mr. Cox gallantly kept his promise . On October twenty-seventh , the President received fifteen pro-League Republicans , men and women , and made an eloquent appeal to them on behalf of the League . It was useless . Mr. Harding straddled the League issue , the campaign shifted to a patchwork of other questions representing simply a reaction from the tremendous effort of the war . A will-o ' - the- wisp plea for a return to " normalcy " carried the day , and Mr. Harding was elected . A Game of Cities As far back as the Peace Conference and before , my husband and I had amused ourselves with the speculation as to where we would live after leaving the White House . In his usual orderly way Woodrow suggested that we make a list of things we considered essential to a congenial home and opposite them put a list of the cities we liked best , and then see how each city @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the box score came out as follows : Eventually Washington was decided on for these reasons , mainly : ( l ) The Library of Congress afforded the facilities which my husband wished to use while writing a book he had long had in mind ; and . ( 2 ) it was home to me . My husband was eager to build a house that would be simple and yet adequate to our needs , and with this in view we rode often to the Conduit Road to view a beautiful site overlooking the Potomac River . Mr. Wilson was so enamored of the location that he asked an architect to spend a day and night at the White House discussing the feasibility of building there . The architect agreed with me that while the view was fine the lot was too shallow , owing to a sharp drop at the back . A street-railway franchise prevented the acquisition of enough ground for the house he wanted . So we turned to another and , to my mind , finer site on top of a hill , where stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very lovely . This was a place I had wanted for years , and I was deeply disappointed to find it had no connection with the city water , sewage or lighting systems , and the cost of these , in addition to rebuilding and purchase , amounted to a large aura . House Hunting I had about begun to despair when I stumbled onto a beautiful place of some twenty-six acres opposite the Bureau of Standards . There was enough ground to secure privacy , the place was accessible to everything , had marvelous oak trees and a rippling little stream . I was so excited when Mr. Wilson set out with my brother Wilmer and me to see it , and so crestfallen when he dashed my hopes by saying he did not feel he could buy a property that must necessarily be needed by the Government in a few years . The Bureau of Standards must soon expand , he added , and that this was the logical way for it to grow . He felt it would embarrass the Government to condemn the property owned by an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Government he had served needed what he owned . My habit was to make my inspections of possible places very early each morning , when my husband needed me least . Generally I would leave the White House at eight o'clock while he was having his bath and shaving  --  a ceremony he never omitted , though it was a slow and tedious process since the loss of the use of his left hand . One of these mornings I came to S Street to see two houses in the 2300 block  --  one which was later bought and occupied by Mr. Herbert Hoover . Neither house met our needs . I was about to get in the car , when the agent who was showing the properties asked if I would go directly across the street to see another . The owner , Mr. Q , had just extended the invitation , saying that if his house suited us he would sell . I found an unpretentious , comfortable , dignified house , fitted to the needs of a gentleman 's home . I felt , however , that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having built it for his own use , was probably acting on impulse when he said he would sell . Reaching the bedroom Boor , where everything was in perfect order and the whole atmosphere so serene , I refused to look further , not wishing to encounter another disappointment . I returned to the White House and told my husband that this was the one house I felt would qualify in every particular , but I did not think we could get it . We still had under consideration a house on Wyoming Avenue , afterward bought by Chief Justice Taft . But as the owners did not want to sell the house without the furniture , which we did not want , we had about decided against the place . Without my knowledge , Mr. Wilson got my brother to have the agent get the price on the S Street house and have the title searched . When this was done , the afternoon of December fourteenth he insisted that I should go to a concert . by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra . Since he had been sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was so urgent that I consented . Upon my return I found him in the Oval Room , sitting by an open fire , and to my amazement . he handed me the deed to the S Street property , say-Mg he had bought it as a gift to me , and hoped it would compensate in some way for the loss of the Bureau of Standards place . Bless his dear heart ! I was overcome . Then the horrible thought came that I had looked at the place superficially and there might be things we would not like . However , my husband had arranged to go with me the following day to see the house . On reaching the door , Woodrow 's man brought a small piece of sod , which , with the key to one of the doors , my husband presented to me -- the sod representing the land , and the key the house . Woodrow said that it was an old Scotch custom . We went through the rooms , deciding which each should have for his own , what alterations we must make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for some skeleton in a closet . There was nothing . And as I sit here in my own den looking back over the years it has been our home , I know that we made no mistake . My husband 's furniture had been in storage in Princeton for eight years and mine in Washington since my marriage . About eight in the morning of February fourth , trucks which had been on the road all night drew up at 2340 S Street . Before the men could start to unload , Mr. Q appeared on the doorstep of the empty house and , watch in hand , said the house was in his possession until noon and nothing could be moved in . The foreman telephoned the White House and I telephoned my brother Wilmer to see what he could do , thinking there had been some misunderstanding that could be easily straightened out . There was nothing Wilmer could do but wait . The agreement was that we were to have possession at noon , and Mr. Q sat tight on the agreement . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was irritated because we would not buy two Italian vases of him . In taking over the house we had purchased a number of things  --  carpets , furniture in the servants ' rooms and two handsome lanterns in the main hall . Especially did Mr. and Mrs. Q wish us to take the urn-shaped vases which stood on either side of the door giving onto the garden in the back . He said he himself had imported them and would sell them to us for three hundred dollars . The only reason I did not take them was that , with the expense of necessary alterations , I did not think we could afford them . The real-estate agent who had attended to the transfer informed me that inasmuch as the vases were set in concrete , they constituted , according to common practice , a part of the house and that we could insist on their being left without extra compensation . Not for an instant . did we eontem plate doing any such thing , but we did decline to purchase . Mr. Q sent men to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the vases were broken into bits , which would . of course , chagrin any lover of beautiful things . At the time , though , I resented his irritation against us.
