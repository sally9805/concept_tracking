txt A Forgotten Group . To the Editor of The New York Times : My experience in seeking aid for an elderly womfm without a family has revealed the fact that there is no place where this type of need is being cared for . I sought information front seven of the outstanding organizations in the city , and while there is family relief and children and aged couples are being helped there is no place in the picture for this pitiful group . They can not get work . They can not get food or help for rent . Old age pensions are not always obtainable when citizenship papers have been neglected . Homes for the aged are crowded , with long waiting lists , and most of these old people love the little room they ' call home and are struggling against great odds to hold it  --  a few dollars a month until work is again available will often tide them over . The most common ground for refusal to help is that " no new cases are being taken on owing to lack of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when , funds are available this group be considered . New York , Oct. 31 , 1932 . L. M.
