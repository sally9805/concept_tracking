Every Day 's A Holiday ( Paramount ) . In the peculiar idiom of show business , Mae West 's art comes under the head of umph . This quality is expressed by sinuous gyrating and prurient murmurings . That this sort of thing will make money is well established . Actress West 's last recorded cinema earnings ( 1936 ) were $323,000 , about as much salary as Bethlehem Steel 's president , Eugene G. Grace , and the chairman of its board , Charles M. Schwab , draw down together . That umph sometimes shocks the public is established too ( see p. 57 ) . <P> For Every Day 's A Holiday Paramount made a determined effort to de-umph Mae West by vacuum-cleaning the script , disguising Mae in a fantastic black French periwig . But , like trying to purify the water by whitewashing the village pump , it did not work . To situations considerably less potential than the story of Adam &; Eve , Actress West imparts a meaning all her own ; despite all directorial and script-writing efforts to make her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleases . As sexless a game as selling a sucker the Brooklyn Bridge resembles , in the West vernacular , a bargain sale of great temptations . <P> Other impressions of Every Day 's A Holiday : snowy-haired Charles Winninger in typical foxy grandpa mood , Negro Swing-Trumpeter Louis Armstrong leading a torchlight procession , the plushy mustiness of the turn of the century , and a few gags , all mothered and murmured by Miss West . Typical examples : Q. " You mean he made love to you ? ' ' A. " Well , he went through all the emotions . . . . " " Keep a diary and some day it 'll keep you . . . . " " She 's not as strait-laced as she 's laced up to be . . . . " <P> With the release of Every Day 's A Holiday , Paramount and Mae West parted company . She is under contract to Producer Emanuel Cohen , whose production Paramount has sponsored . Last week Producer Cohen and Adolph Zukor , Paramount head , climaxed a four-year feud by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mae West 's loss was that on Producer Cohen 's personal payroll is Crooner Bing Crosby . <P> Mannequin ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . When Actress Joan Crawford , in the lithe chic of a $2.98 bathing suit , adjusts her shopworn profile to a summer night and sighs to her handsome vis-a-vis , " why do you suppose the moon is always bigger on Saturday night ? , " a million understanding shopgirl hearts sigh with her . And when , temporarily exalted to a swank Manhattan penthouse , Joan looks over the parapet at the twinkling city , " piled up against the dark , " many a less lyric lass wishes that she , too , might sometime be so pent up . <P> For the last decade , Cinemactress Joan Crawford has been hushaby lady to millions for whom dreams at prevailing box-office prices are the only escape from failure and mediocrity . Her partner in romance is usually some slick-haired reigning actor . In Mannequin , crinkly-eyed , roughhewn Spencer Tracy seems ill at ease , especially with dialogue lines like " somebody hit me with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
