txt Vaccae in Urbe Here in Knickerbocker Village we are not particularly interested in farming , but the K. V. T. A. forum recently discussed the spread in the cost of milk between the producer and the consumer . The general idea seemed to be that since the producer got so little the consumer should pay less . Your correspondent mentioned recently the number of dairy farms that had been foreclosed and the added load of the dairyman who is in debt . This seems to fit in with the view that no matter how much the dairyman gets for his milk there will be no profit for him ? it will be absorbed by the land . Possibly if conditions get too bad upState , some arrangement might be made to keep a cow in the Knickerbocker Village gardens . But how many cows would the 5,000 villagers have to keep ? And who would milk the cows ? And when you mention the right side of a cow do you mean looking forward or aft ? T. N. MUNRO . New York , Nov. 30 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
