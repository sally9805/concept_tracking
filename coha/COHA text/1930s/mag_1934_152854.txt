For ten months Nationalist Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek has fought the fire of Communismin China by wetting down the ground with his New Life Movement . " Water , " he quotes , " always flows over a wet surface ; while fire goes wherever it is dry . ' ' Last week westerners were reading the free English translation of his Outline of The New Life Movement made by his U. S.-educated , banged-browed wife , youngest daughter of China 's famed Soong family . <P> Painstaking as a primer , the Outline runs to questions and answers . Examples : <P> What is Life ? <P> Nothing more than the continuation of activities . <P> What is New Life ? <P> Change and readaptation . <P> What is the New Life Movement ? <P> To teach the people to adapt themselves to new conditions . <P> To sweep away the anarchy and " spiritlessness " of Chinese who " lack proper guidance for taking and giving , " the Outline proposes ' ' a wild storm " ; to give China the new " right spirit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Chinese must relearn , says Chiang , one by one and all together , the breeze 's four virtues : li , i , lien and ch'ih . <P> Ch'ih , meaning " consciousness , " must govern the motive of action through the sense of duty . <P> Lien , meaning " clear " supplies a choice between right &; wrong actions . <P> I , meaning " proper " carries out the action in accordance with social order . <P> Li , meaning " reason " " regulates the outward form of that particular action . " <P> From Chiang 's point of view , however , the four ancient virtues mean even more : ch'ih , patriotism ; lien , morality ; i , social sense or the exact opposite of its English meaning , and li , discipline-the four cardinal virtues of any nationalistic State . Says Chiang : <P> " The four are interrelated . Otherwise li without i becomes dishonest ; without lien becomes extravagant ; without ch'ih becomes flattering . All these may appear like li but really they are not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be chaotic ; without i , violent ; without lien , ugly . They are no longer ch'ih . " <P> In spreading the New Life Movement , the Outline lays down the rule that " no contribution shall be raised from the public . " Instead , working down from Generalissimo Chiang himself , " the movement should be started first from oneself and gradually be extended to others . It should be started with simple matters ( good manners and cleanliness ) and gradually extended . . . . Thus it is hoped that rudeness and vulgarity will be got rid of . "
