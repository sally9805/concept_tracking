Business Prefers Racketeers CURRENT revelations of racketeering in the ranks of labor have indicated two new characteristics . There are many illustrations to show that business , far from turning away from racketeers who corrupt and exploit the cause of labor , actually prefers racketeers . Business , of course , prefers to deal neither with holiest nor dishonest unions ; but given a choice it chooses the latter , encourages them and frequently makes them an integral part of its labor policy . The second new characteristic partially explains the first . It is that the racket toll now comes largely from the pay envelopes of labor , from the sadly depleted depression rations that the fortunate employed workers are compelled to accept . The depression has ended the heroic days of labor racketeering when a Brindell , like a modern Robin Hood , could extort sums from the bosses and at the same time compel them to pay their employees union wages . The trend has been tersely summarized by Jake ( " the Bum " ) Wenner , business agent of a Brooklyn painters ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of business unionism , and now under Indictment for extorting $300 from a contractor to call off a strike . Says Jake : " When the boss starts to complain that he ca n't pay the racketeers and pay union wages too , he is told , ' Do n't be a fool . Vlio tells you to pay the donkeys $9 a day ? Who pays union wages these days ? Give them $3 or $4 and they 'll be glad to get it . ' " For illustrations of this phenomenon in labor racketeering we may draw on a variety of New York industries , the retail clothing industry , with its large and small neighborhood stores , the enormously profitable restaurant and cafeteria industry and the steel-construction industry , which is definitely a part of big business . One turns to the plight of anti-racketeering elements in the International Union of Operating Engineers with a sinking feeling of almost complete hopelessness . It is a story of a long struggle against a dictatorship by the International , corruption on the part of the dictator , imprisonment of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , finally , an alliance between the steel-trust-dominated erectors and the discredited union elements . And during it all , over a period of five years , those who have fought for some standard of trade-union decency have tramped the streets hungry and jobless , rebuffed and shunted about by those who should he their friends . Patrick J. Comerford , Tammany lieutenant in the labor movement , was the dictator of the International Union of Operating Engineers . The International called him a " supervisor " and created a " supervisor system " for all its local unions . Comer ford bossed the International through his aids . Ile maintained personal control over Local 125 in New York City , which held jurisdiction over all hoisting engineers employed in the city and in Westchester County . From a union suite of rooms whose luxuriousness rivaled the sanctums of great corporations , Comerford ruled the union with an iron hand . Protesting members were blacklisted and expelled without trials , elections were canceled . On one occasion when constitutional changes were before the union , Comerford cast the vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $250,000 in dues and assessments was collected and disbursed without any satisfactory explanation to the members . Comerford ordered and ended strikes without any apparent rhyme or reason . When Comerford was indicted for evasion of federal income-tax payments , some of the " strikes " were explained . The trial showed that in addition to his union salary of $200 a week and expenses , Comerford received $75 a week from one nonunion hoisting company and sums ranging from $2,500 to $7,000 from contractors as the price of " settling labor disputes . " A second non-union firm paid him $50 a week for seven months . Using his power as an influential member of the Building Trades Council , he had charged two hod carriers ' locals $500 each for the right to join the council . Comerford was convicted of tax evasions and jailed for a year , whereupon efforts to win his early release were begun at once , with Christian G. Norman , executive head of the Building Trades Employers ' Association , offering to act as his guardian during a period of parole . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who retained the late Jack ( " Legs " ) Diamond and Jacob ( " Little Augie " ) Orgen to break a painters ' strike in 1927 and paid them $25,000 , all with the approval of the employers ' association . Meanwhile , the rank and file of Local 125 had instituted court action to win control of their union . In June of 1932 the members obtained an order removing Comerford from office and giving the members the right to govern themselves . Comerford and the International Union promptly revoked the charter of Local 125 , created Local 130 and informed all employers that their collective agreements would henceforth be carried out by the new local . Today , after years of litigation , Local 125 has its charter back again , but six newly created locals make raids on the jurisdiction it formerly held . Each of the new locals is captained by former Comerford supporters . The strength of the new locals lies in the preference they receive at the bands of the steel erectors . P.W.A. authorities have a score of affidavits indicating that Local @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the other locals . It is charged that MeClintic-Marshall , the American Bridge Company and the Frederick Share Corporation have joined in this discrimination , though their executives insist that the function of hiring help belongs to the foremen , who , it would appear , have no remote connection with company policy . The apex of cooperation between the Comerford elements and the steel companies is best illustrated by the apparent understanding with Local 403 . This local has agreed to take no part in sympathetic building-trade strikes . Affirmatively , this means that it has agreed to work with strikebreakers . It has thus made itself a tool of the steel interests in the thirty-year rear against the union of structural iron workers . Local 403 has carried through its understanding to the hilt , as a result of which it has been thrown out of the Building Trades Council ; but it continues a favored section of its own International and enjoys the privilege of calling itself an A.F. of L. union . The officers of Local 403 enjoy an even more concrete advantage . Each engineer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Local 403 who are so favored ? must pay $1 a day to the expense fund of the salaried officers of Local 403 . The restaurant and cafeteria industry of New York City is at once one of the worst exploiters of labor and one of the least effectively organized . The State Department of Labor recently found $501 to he the median net cash annual wage for women workers in restaurants . Waiters and waitresses receive wages ranging from nothing to $5 a week . Tips do not bring these figures anywhere near a living wage , and charges for uniforms , laundering , meals , etc. , frequently wipe out wages as well as tips , For the kitchen workers there arc , of course , no tips at all . What slight protection the restaurant workers of New York City receive comes from the ranks of locals affiliated with the I lotel and Restaurant orkers ' International Alliance , an A.F. of L. union , and some locals allihated with the independent Food Workers ' Industrial Union . Locals 16 and 302 of the Al ' . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former has extensive jurisdiction over restaurants , hotels and clubs ; the latter is intended to be the union of delicatessen clerks and cafeteria workers . Actual power over these local unions , and a large amount of influence over the Food Workers ' Industrial Union , is concentrated in the hands of a so-called employers ' group known as the Metropolitan Cafeteria and Restaurant Owners ' Association , in whose early stages aids of the late Dutch Schultz played an active part . The large cafeteria chains , Folds-Fisher , Chase Commissary , Willow and Stewart , are members of the Metropolitan , as are almost three hundred other Manhattan restaurants . It costs $250 to join the Metropolitan and $5 a week from then on . // With the membership goes a gold-colored placque renting for $18 . The placque carries the name of the Metropolitan and the significant motto , " United We Stand . " Restaurants and cafeterias that seek to resist the appeal of the Metropolitan have been known to fall . But the holdouts among the restaurants , with the exceptions of the very large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in fact , great advantage in belonging to the Metropolitan , and in terms of dollars and cents the $250 initiation fee and the $260 in annual dues ( even if the payments do not end there ) is a fine investment . What does a restaurant owner get for his membership in the Metropolitan ? Hc gets the right to do as he pleases with his help , particularly in cafeterias. lie gets Ile right to consider union agree- ments as e gets the right to call upon the , Metropolitan and tell them that he wants to be rid of that " Red counterman " or this " Red waitress " ; and lie gets the right to feel that his request will be met . Union leaders conic to the Metropolitan like so many errand boys and heave with their instructions . In fact , one contract signed with a large restaurant chain gave the address of the Metropolitan as the address of the union . The two unions are of a piece with Comerford 's old Local 125 in their lack of democracy . Paul N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he and he alone is the " doctor who knows what 's good for the union . " He has caused members to be expelled for selling Communist literature around union headquarters . Ile has decreed " no politics in the union , " while he has made the local a co ; in the Tammany machine . I le has expelled one member of thirty years ' standing , a non-Communist , because he complained to the International about racketeering influences in the local . He has hired J. Richard Davis , chief of the late Dutch Schultz 's legal staff , as the union attorney . He was a reluctant supporter of minimum-wage legislation and tried his best to prevent an accurate study of what women members of his union arc paid . Early this year he called night-club strikes of mysterious origin anti ended them with equally mysterious settlements . Soon after , he was dined at a large non-union hotel by an audience gathered together by leaders of the Metropolitan . ' no sponsors of the dinner included one restaurateur who had not paid his help for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more obvious in the case of Local 302 . Employees of the cafeteria chains were " organized " into the local by their employers . No wage increases or other advantages accrued upon the signing of the " collective agreements , " except in some cases where the wage was raised sufficiently to cover the payment of union dues . In the case of employees of the Folds-Fishier chain , unionization brought many of them wage cuts . Many promises were made the new members but not one of them has been kept . The union bosses have divided the membership of Local 302 into three branches , A , B and C. Branch A is composed of clerks and is under the thumb of the dominating leaders of the local , Max Pincus , John Williams and Charles Epstein . Class B is composed of cafeteria workers in all but the chains , and Branch C I ? s made up of employees of the four cafeteria chains . By-laws recently jammed through a meeting by Pincus , Williams and Epstein , after a majority of the meeting had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the hands of Branch A. Local 302 is a union in name only . The same set-up that operates in the restaurant industry ? a so-called employers ' association working hand in glove with pliant and accommodating labor leaders ? has been true until recently of part of New York 's retail clothing industry . Officials of two locals of the Retail Clerks ' International Protective Association devoted their major efforts to enrolling stores in a Retail Clothing Merchants ' Association . While the union leaders thus built the Clothing Merchants ' Association , they permitted working standards to drop . in the case of stores selling ladies ' apparel , the union was interested almost exclusively in the collection of dues . In exchange for this , the stores received the right to be unmolested by pickets and to display , when they cared to , an A.F. of L. sign . flow much this can mean to an employer may be seen in the case of one very large store which was ready to sign an agreement whereby it would pay the union $1,000 a week in dues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the agreement . For $52,000 a year then , this store would have bought protection against bona-fide unionization which - might have cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in wage increases . Labor racketeering that has come to light of late has one other common characteristic ? the failure of the American Federation of Labor to protect its members and its reputation against those who have misused the movement . An exception must be noted in the case of the retail clerks , where President Green 's action was prompt and effective . Here , however , he was aided in his efforts by an internal light that lined up time Clerks ' International against certain New York elements . However , the job has been done and the retail clerks ' union house has been cleansed . Not so fortunate have been the members of Local 125 of the Operating Engineers and of Locals 16 and 302 of the Restaurant Workers . Their own internationals and the A.F. of L. have given no heed to their protests . Mr. Green and the A.F. of L. have frequently Pointed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affairs of affiliated internationals . A resolution passed at the Atlantic City convention , and almost completely unnoticed in the battle over Industrial unionism , has rectified this situation . The resolution instructed the Executive Council of the A-F. of L. " to initiate a determined campaign to eradicate every sign of racketeering , corruption and gangstcrism in the labor movement , taking allessary measures to overcome the resistance of thosi ! elements in the trade unions who are today tolerating and protecting these evils . " Should Mr. Green and his Council shirk their responsibility , per/lap ; the new progressive bloc Nvill add the elimination of racketeering to its program .
