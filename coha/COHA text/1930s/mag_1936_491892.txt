THERE never has been anybody like Rube Waddell , and there never will be . He was a natural . I read Roy Stockton 's article , Me and Paul , about the doings and undoings of the Dean brothers , and I enjoyed it . But if Dizzy Dean is crazy he is crazy like a fox . His dizziness is a sort of protective discoloration . He is really one of baseball 's smartest young men . The Rube was just naturally dizzy because he was born that way . It was his nature , and he could n't help it . I have been in this business for a couple of lifetimes , and I have seen them all . I have seen the Great Shires , who , last season , managed Harrisburg in the N. Y.-Penn . League , and the Brooklyn Hairiness Boys , who ran past each other between the bases . I have seen Wild Bill This , and Screwy Sam That ; and the Rube , in his heyday , made them all look like amateur night . Of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No pitcher ever had a feeder like Ossie SchreckSchreckengost . He was the fizz powder in the pinwheel that was Waddell . He was the wilder of the two in many ways . It was in /900 , and I was managing the Milwaukee club in the newly baptized American League . Comiskey was piloting the Chicago White Stockings , having borrowed the name from the Chicago National team , which had tossed it on the ash heap after Pop Anson left them . I was neck deep in a race with Comiskey , but he had the edge on me in his pitching staff , and I began to look around for a flinger with a fare ball with a hap on it . I had been reading about a man named Waddell who had been suspended by Pittsburgh and who was evidently harder to handle than a cage full of Clyde Beatty 's cats . When Fred Clarke slapped the suspension on him , he had jumped to the Punxsutawney independent team , outside the pale of organized baseball . Ordinarily , I would not have been interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figured that maybe I could succeed where Fred Clarke had flopped . Clarke , I knew , was a hard-boiled disciplinarian , and hot-headed to boot . I had an idea that if there was one thing I could do , it was get along with the men who were working for me . I jumped on the train and went to call on Barney Dreyfuss , owner of the Pirates . Barney agreed to let me negotiate with the Rube , and he did it with suspicious alacrity . He knew  --  and I found out later  --  that responsibilities rested no heavier on Waddell than they do on the placid brow of Baby LeRoy . He had four passions , and four only : He loved to fish . He loved the stuff that the vintners sell . He loved fires . And he loved to pitch ball games . In about that order . Only , sometimes he reversed the first two . However , I wanted the Rube . I had seen him pitch a game for Grand Rapids a year or two before , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Pitcher From Punxsutawney S O I PUT in a long-distance call to the Rube in Punxsutawney . The hotel proprietor sent out a dragnet to locate him . Finally I heard his voice rumbling like an African war drum on the other end and I made my first error . I said , " Hello , Rube . " The voice said , " Who the hell are you ? " Plainly , he resented such familiarity . I began all over again . I said , " Is that you , Eddie ? " We got along all right after that . I said , " Eddie , the folks out in Milwaukee would like mighty well to have you wearing a Milwaukee uniform . We believe that with you we can go on and win that pennant . You would like it out there , Eddie , and they would like you . " I had to stop for breath . But it was no sale . I realized later that I should have put in my time talking about Milwaukee beer . " They like me here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . They are counting on me and I could n't let them down . There 's not enough money in Milwaukee to make me run out on them . " I went back empty-handed , but I sent him a telegram every day for two weeks , and followed the telegrams up with letters . Maybe I raised my ante a little bit . At any rate , I won out over his loyalty to the good people of Punxsutawney who loved him so much . At the end of two weeks , he sent me a wire saying , " Come and get me . " He sent it , I know , with his great heart breaking at the prospect of deserting his pals in their hour of need . I took the next train and was up early the next morning to have breakfast with the Rube . Over four eggs , a stack of wheats , home fries and a pitcher of coffee , he completed his capitulation . After breakfast , he suggested a walk . " I got a few little odds and ends @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go in here a minute , " he said , and we went into a store . The Rube asked the owner how much he owed him , and the owner finally got it added up , and the Rube handed the bill ' to me . We made twelve such stops , . including men's-clothing stores , sporting-goods stores , pressing establishments and saloons . But the prize was the visit to the Adams Express Company . The Rube was into them to the tune of eight dollars . A friend had shipped a dog to him by express C. 0 . D. I do n't know yet how he talked that Adams ea-press agent into letting him take the hound without paying for it . The express companies in those days were as soft and pliable as the warden of a Georgia chain gang . My cash was running low . I had just about enough to get us back to Milwaukee , and I told the Rube to take it easy . " Oh , that 's all right , " he said , " There 's only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three gilded balls and bailed out the Rube 's watch . All this time I had been worrying about the problem of sneaking the Rube out of town without starting i riot . I ordered sandwiches in his hotel room and we ate there . Our train was leaving at three o'clock . I figured thatsif we left the hotel at 2:45 , we would just have time . At the zero hour we went over the top . We made the station , bought the tickets , and still had five minutes to wait . A group of serious-looking men approached . A minute before , they had n't been there . Seemingly , they had come up out of the woodwork . " Here comes trouble , " I said to myself . I knew it would be the simplest thing in the world for them to swear out a warrant for any one of the Rube 's countless irregularities and keep him . The spokesman came up and shook me by the hand . " Are you Connie Mack ? " I said I was . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " You are doing us a great favor . Waddell is a great pitcher , but we feel very strongly that Punxsutawney would be better off without him . " The Rube was watching us out of the corner of his eye , pretending to he aloof . He went big in Milwaukee . He was colorful , unpredictable and unorthodox . The fans could count on him for more than a master job of pitching . He gave them belly laughs and thrills and excitement . He was enormously strong , eccentric , erratic , and filled with the flame of baseball genius . In August we were playing a double-header in Chicago . The first game was strung out for seventeen innings . The Rube pitched all seventeen innings , and won the game with a triple that smacked up against the right-field fence . The score was 3 to 2 . After he had set down the last Chicago batter in the last half of the seventeenth , he made his way to the bench from the pitcher 's box in a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most of the afternoon , and Dick Padden , the White Stocking captain , suggested that we cut the second game down to five innings . I told Padden it would be all right with me . Then I turned to the Rube . The memory of Waddell 's playful little ways had faded . It was tough to take , because it probably meant that Milwaukee would lose the American League pennant , but I sent a wire to the Rube at his fishing camp . An answer came back so quickly that it had a hop on it like the Rube 's fast one . He said " I will quit baseball before I will play for the Pirates . " He added that he would rejoin the Milwaukee club in Indianapolis , our next stop . I played fair with Dreyfuss . I did n't encourage the Rube in his rebellion . Instead , I sat down and wrote a letter to Dreyfuss explaining the situation , and advised him to send an envoy to Indianapolis to put the bee on Waddell personally . At Indianapolis I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , to see Waddell . Zimmer came to me for help . I told him he would have to use more tangible arguments . Accordingly , the next morning he took the Rube out and arrayed him in new shoes , a new suit of electric-blue clothes , a new tie and shirt , and capped it off by presenting him a traveling hag , hoping that the Rube would be so anxious to use it that he would consent to travel . The Rube came back to the hotel as meek as a lamb . Recalling the Rube did n't help Dreyfuss , though it stalled my Milwaukee club . Fred Clarke was still unable to get along with him . I find it hard to tell his story in orderly sequence . Perhaps it is because the Rube was not an orderly person . I keep remembering bits and Ossie Schreck keeps getting tangled up in them . Schreck was the Harpo Marx of his time . After spending fifteen minutes with Schreck in the smoker of a Pullman , Henry Beach Needham , the first man to write @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his seat speechless . After sitting silent for ten minutes , he turned to me and said , " Well , Mr. Mack , I 've been all around , but I 've heard things tonight have never heard before . " Schreck and the Rube used to room together . In those days , two players had to sleep in one bed to save expense money . Ossie used to kick a lot about the Rube 's habits , but his loudest kick came one spring . Ossie returned his contract unsigned . " This contract is all right , " he wrote , " but before I sign with you , I got to see Waddell 's signed contract . I suppose I got to room with him , and if that 's so , you got to put a clause in his contract that he ca n't eat animal crackers in bed . " I inserted the clause in Waddell 's contract and the Rube agreed to make the sacrifice for the good of the team . The TWO  --  Man Baseball Team S CHRECK could do more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plate . I had been a catcher myself , and while I was probably no Schang or Cochrane , I knew good backstopping when I saw it . I loved to watch Schreck catch . He caught 99 " ioo per cent of balls thrown to him with one hand , his mitt hand . The other hand might as well have been cut off , except for the business of tossing the ball back to the pitcher or picking ' em off second when they tried to steal . He used his gloved hand like a shortstop . He chewed tobacco and kept his glove soft and pliable by a continuous natural lubrication . He worked over his glove more than any catcher I ever saw . He was always unlacing it and fixing the padding , which meant , with him , merely taking out hunks of padding and throwing it away . He refused to wear shin guards . The story about the Rube calling in his fielders and pitching all by himself has become part of our national folklore and has taken on , through the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the original story . But never have I heard the teller give Schreck credit for his part in the day 's work . Ossie and the Rube were working against the Steelton club at Steelton on an off day . In those days the big corporation industrial teams were no mean opponents . In the ninth inning Rube called the other players in and made them sit on the bench . Schreck sat down behind the home plate and caught the balls without once getting on his feet as Rube struck out the three men who faced him . There are any number of versions of the Rube 's stunt . Back in 1902 , in a six-game series with Detroit , Waddell pitched in all six games . If we were losing , he would want to walk right out onto the field and make our pitcher give him the ball , so that be could take up the white man 's burden . I had to hang onto his uniform to stop him . In the sixth game he called in the outfield . The league rules kept them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down on the ground behind the infielders and watched the great man do his stuff . The Rube got away with it in this case , but a pitcher can go too often to the well . Even a pitcher like Waddell . He ran into grief in an exhibition game in Memphis , a season or two later . There were four innings to go and the score was 6 to 0 . But this time his stunt backfired on him . He went along all right until the last man was up in the ninth . He struck him out and turned toward the showers , but Doe Powers , who was catching him that day , instead of Schreck , dropped the and the batter was safe at first . The Memphis players took heart at this and a couple of them popped up little scratch hits which any infielder could have caught in his hip pocket . The Rube ran himself ragged chasing them , and finally sent in an SOS for help . Harry Davis , who was managing in my place , saw a chance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boys on the bench . The Rube finally struck out a man with the bases full , and the game was over . But he looked pretty peaked . In those days we had a big fifty-gallon barrel of drinking water by the bench thirty feet from the home plate . That was before the days of filtered , chilled water in glass and porcelain containers in a dugout . Doe Powers , our other catcher , went after a pop foul too hard and went into the barrel . He was hurt , but managed to finish the game after we wrung him out . Schreck could n't replace him , for he had caught a foul tip on a finger of his throwing hand . Well , Powers ' injury was even worse the next day , and we had to call upon Sehreck to catch , banana finger and all , because the Rube was pitching and we had no one else who could work with the Rube . Catch as Catch Can We were playing at St. Louis , a strong club managed by McAleer . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A man tried to steal . He threw it down to second on the bounce , and Danny Murphy caught it to make the put-out . The next time he arched it down to second in a feeble rainbow to beat the runner . The rest of the time he rolled the ball back to the Rube with his gloved hand . We beat St. Louis 5 to 2 , and there never was a madder man than McAleer , in the knowledge that a team with a one-handed catcher had taken him . There was the game in 1903 in Boston . The Red Sox were champs . They knew it was Wa.ddell 's turn to pitch , so they fixed up a job on him . First Baseman Lachance , a bull-like fellow , challenged Waddell to a wrestling match before the game . Rube went for the idea with yelps of joy . They wrestled for a full half hour before the Rube pinned Lachance 's shoulders to the ground . Lachance was all in . He did n't play that day at ( Continued from Pasco 13 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hill as fresh as a daisy and shut Boston out . There was the time in a game in Philadelphia when he was pitching against the famous Baltimore Orioles . Two men were out in the ninth . The Rube waved to the crowd to go home , making signs that it was all over . He pitched three balls , and all of them were strikes . Having had Dreyfuss turn Indian giver on me , I did n't bring Waddell to Philadelphia with me when I left Milwaukee . One day in June , 1902 , in Detroit , Jack Sheridan , the umpire , said : " What you need is a man like Waddell , Connie . Why do n't you grab him ? " " I do n't even know where he is now , " I said . " He 's pitching for an outlaw league out in Los Angeles . " On the Trail of a Cleated Shoe I wired the Rube . The answer said : " Send hundred dollars and transportation . " I sent . it and was rash enough to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled into Chicago on our next jump , I expected to see him walk up to me in the lobby of the hotel with that hand outstretched into which you could drop a baseball and lose it from sight like a liver pill . The Rube had n't been in Los Angeles as long as he had been in Punxsutawney . He got on the train all right , but he got off again with my transportation and advance money , swearing to live and play baseball in Los Angeles for the rest of his days . I went to Ban Johnson , president of the league . Ban put on his hat and took me around to a detective agency . It was a pleasure to watch them go into action . Los Angeles was playing in San Francisco then , and the Chicago office of the agency sent the Fris.co office a long telegram , with me slipping in bits of information as to the best way to creep up on the Rube . It must have worked , for we got a wire the next day , saying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ east . It was arranged that the men should deliver him at Kansas City . We would be playing a series with St. Louis , and I ran over to K. C. to take him off their hands , I had my fingers crossed . I would believe the detectives had the Rube when I saw him . He was on the train this time all right . So was Young Corbett , the featherweight champion of the world , and the Rube was following him around in a trance , suffering from an overwhelming ease of hero worship . Young Corbett had just knocked out Terrible Terry McGovern . The champion was stopping in Kansas City . There were two clubs in Kansas City then , and the Rube wanted to pitch for one of them , so that Young Corbett could see him do his stuff , I took a firm hold of my temper and decided to use strategy . The Rube and I actually went out to the ball park that afternoon . The local clubs had heard of the Rube 's new scheme and , naturally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was taking a chance . Young Corbett was sitting in a box seat to watch his friend pitch , but somehow I talked the Rube out of it and got him on a train for Baltimore , our next stand . I have sometimes been told that I have a persuasive way of talking . If it is true , I needed it all that day . In addition to taking a look at the flagpole to see which way the wind was blowing , I used to take a look at the dugout when I got to the ball park , to see if the Rube 's 215 pounds of uncertainty was on the bench . I had to keep an eye on him to keep him from joining up with the fire department in any town we happened to be playing in . He always wore a red undershirt , so that when the fire bell rang he could pull off his coat , thus exposing his crimson credentials , and gallop off to the blaze , where he would try to direct operations by ringing commands , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were in Dallas , Texas , the Rube pulled one of his periodic vanishing acts , and was missing for three days . I sent out men to search in all of the likely spots , and even went to look at the best fishing holes myself , but with no result . Along about nightfall of the third day , I was standing on the sidewalk in front of our hotel when a hook-and-ladder outfit came by with a clanging of gongs and a drumming of horses ' hoofs . The Prodigal Pitcher There was the Rube , sitting in the driver 's seat , dressed in a fireman 's uniform , rubber boots , metal hat , red-flannel shirt and all . He did n't look up as he whirled by ; he was intent on his job . He had gone around to the firehouse to get a job . And this was his tryout run to see if he could make the grade as a member of /he Dallas Fire Department . The passing fire engines were n't the only lure . If he passed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a crowd of boys playing ball , he would join up with them and forget all about the Tigers or the Red Sox . Once he was missing for several weeks . All efforts to find him were useless . Washington was playing us here in Philadelphia , and after the game the Washington team climbed into their omnibus and settled back to get the kinks out of their legs . Suddenly the bus began to rock violently . The Senators got out and peered under the vehicle . - Upon investigation , they found Waddell underneath , trying to lift the whole contraption on his barn-door shoulders . He was clad simply and tastefully in a shirt and a pair of trousers , and nothing else . He had been off on a tear , but the fun was wearing thin , and lifting the bus had seemed to him one last chance to get some amusement out of life . Another time when he was missing during a trainin.g trip , he returned to us as the drum major of a band marching up the main street , a look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a show window as an automaton . Like other colorful athletes , the Rube had his fling at the stage . He was once starred in a play called The Stain of Guilt . It was a lot of fun for the // Rube , but not much fun for the management . One scene was laid in a hotel . The villain had the girl in his clutches . At this point an elevator door was supposed to open and the Rube was to step out declaiming : " Unhand that gel , you cur , " followed by a stage blow knocking the villain down . But Waddell , like Belasco , was all for the realistic touch . He refused to pull his punch . The villain was out , seriously hampering the progress of the play . Waddell 's engagement was brief . Like Bugs Raymond , he had an uncanny way of getting his hooks into money when there was none in sight . In Detroit , once , he came to me in distress . " I 've lost my diamond watch charm , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winning the pennant . I want to ask you how I can go about finding it . I know I had it on this afternoon . " " Advertise for it , " I told him . " You might offer a reward . " " How much reward ? " he asked . " I 'm Hat broke . You ought to know that better than anybody . " " You go ahead and offer ten dollars , " I said , " and if anybody brings it back , I 'll pay it myself . " The next day the Rube called me on the phone and told me to hurry down to a near-by saloon , because a man had found the charm and wanted the ten bucks . I went down and paid out the money and saw the man hand the charm over to the Rube . I found out later that the man was a bartender friend of the Rube 's . The Rube had given the charm to him two days before to keep for him , and no sooner was my back turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Waterloo But the Rube was n't always so smart about money . To quote from the files of the Montgomery Advertiser of March 30 , 1906 : Never before has Rube Waddell ever lost out in a financial transaction before he came to Little Old Montgomery . Now he says colored highwaymen took forty simoleons away from him . The terror of the American League started out last night on a tour of the bright lights and the gay white way here . He was accompanied by friends , but strolled off on another tangent all by himself when the evening was yet young  --  say two o'clock in the morning . In his left trousers pocket he insists he carried a wad of money , all of forty dollars . Now , there are many colored men in Montgomery who need forty dollars the worst way , and the best way to get ' em the Rube says was evidently through him . A blunt instrument came into contact with his head and he took the count . Found sometime later by his friends , he owned a gash in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ says he can positively identify each and every one of his alleged assailants . But the next day , when a couple of hundred colored men were lined up in front of his hospital cot. , he could n't tell one from the other . But while blunt objects could dent his head , rampaging autos bad no terrors for him . He was crossing a street in New York one day when a car struck him . The driver , thinking ho had committed manslaughter , stepped on the gas to make his getaway , but Waddell was too quick for him . He picked himself up and hopped on the running board . " I 'm the man you just ran over , " he said . " You band me fifteen bucks , brother , or I 'll hand you a stiff poke in the eye . You ai n't going to ruin my clothes and get away with it . " He had his sensitive moments . Once while pitching against St. Louis , the Browns ' first-base-line coach yelled , " Get out of there , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitch ! " The Rube looked at him in hurt surprise , dropped his glove , walked off the field and , climbing the fence , joined the shirtsleeve boys in the bleachers . And despite all arguments and pleas , he stayed there . Danny Hoffman always gave the Rube credit for saving his life . Lee Tannehill threw a ball that hit Danny on the temple , and he fell to the ground like a poleaxed steer . Someone went for an ambulance , and the players crowded around in aimless bewilderment . Somebody said that Danny might not live until the doctor got there . Then the man they had called the playboy and clown went into action . Pushing everybody to one side , he gently placed Danny over his shoulder and actually ran across the field . And Danny was no lightweight , and was unconscious to boot . The Rube found a carriage outside , commandeered it with ferocious threats to the driver , and rushed Danny to a hospital . Fooling a Famous Rookie The Rube sat by Danny 's bedside the greater part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ice to Danny 's head to ease his suffering . The Rube always worked hardest 011 new players . The chances are  --  although I can not prove it  --  the chances are he struck out every new man he ever faced . His idea was to put them in their place right from the start and to fill them with a wholesome respect for the great Waddell . I remember that when Eddie Collins met. the Rube for the first time , the Rube 's eyes lit up with an unholy gleam , and he told Eddie that he would like to show him the lowdown on southpaw pitching as practiced in the American League . He told Eddie that if he would grab off a bat , he would toss a few up the alley to him , Ossie Schreck took his place behind the plate in his war paint of mask and chest protector , and the fun began . Eddie stood up there for ten minutes while the Rube 's arms described half circles and the ball smacked into Schreck 's mitt like a can of dynamite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foul tip . He told me afterward that more than half the time he never saw the ball at all as it burned past him . I could see that the kid was upset and that he was probably wondering whether or not I would keep him on , so I walked over to him and said , " Well , the Rube was certainly in form this morning . I do n't think that even Harry Davis could have made a hit off of that pitching . " The Rube looked sort of shamefaced and came up and gave Eddie some pointers about his position at the plate , and the kid got some of his spunk back . Another story came back to me from St. Louis about the Rube . A gang used to sit in the bleachers at St. Louis and bet on balls and strikes and ultimate winners . Maybe they still do . One tin-horn sport offered 3 to 1 on the home team , and a strapping fellow took the short end . When the game started , the strapping one started in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the names he could think of , and be had an inventive mind . Finally the Rube went up into the stands after him . He was doing a pretty job of pushing his tormentor 's head down inside of his collar when the police got there . The police were smart . They rushed the noisy spectator through an exit into a patrol wagon , instead of picking on the Rube . But the gambler was happy . He could see the umpire making gestures , and those gestures meant that the Rube was out of the game . Ban Johnson was in the stands , He had a flash of intuition . Calling the umpire to his box , he told him to let the Rube stay in . The Rube won the game . One more bit of Rubiana comes back to me . We had the Red Sox beaten that day . The score was 7 to 0 in our favor in the ninth inning , when the Sox came to life and pushed over four runs with three men on base . Two were out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was coming to bat . The Rube was sitting in the old tallyho roach , down by the exit gate , ( which used to take us to the station after the game . He had taken his shoes off to cool his toes , and was dozing blissfully on the broken cushions of the tallyho seat . I held up the game and sent for the Rube . He put on one shoe and strolled out on the mound to sit down and put on the other one before the popeyed gaze of the multitude . That was before the rules were changed to allow a pitcher a few warm-up balls . The Rube had to pitch cold . Boston took out their home-rim king and inserted Unglaub , a dangerous right-handed hatter . The Rube pitched just three balls . Unglaub never got his hat off his shoulder . The Rube took off his shoes once more and shuffled to the clubhouse . Fate in a Straw Hat The beginning of the end for Waddell came one day when we were pulling out of Boston after a series @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took three out of four from the Red Sox on that trip and we finished the year with an average of .622 . It was the day on which men are supposed to discard their straw hats . The boys were feeling sort of gay after their big run of luck in Boston and they were celebrating by smashing all the straw hats that appeared in the Back Bay station while they were waiting for their train . It was all a lot of good clean fun , and the players whose hats were smashed entered into the spirit of the thing and got in line to pounce on the nest victim to put in his appearance . One of our pitchers then was a boy named Andy Coakley , now baseball coach at Columbia University . Coakley was a Holy Cross graduate . He kept himself looking trim and neat , and minded his own business in the best Holy Cross tradition . He had pitched on the day before and had won , and as a reward , I had told him that he could spend the last day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he join us on the train at Providence . The Rube was disconsolate when all the hat smashing at the Back Bay station was over , but he brightened up considerably when someone pointed out that Coakley , the Beau Brummel of the team , would be joining us at Providence . In those days , the players carried their own uniforms in specially built suitcases , with a separate compartment for the spiked shoes built into the side of the bag . When Coakley saw the Rube bearing down on him with a gleam in his eye , he instinctively put his hat behind him and raised his bag as protection . Somehow , the spikes on Coakley 's shoes became entangled with the Rube 's chin . The Rube stepped back in hurt surprise , then made a rush at Coakley with a bellow . Coakley sidestepped and the Rube fell over a. pile of luggage and lit on the point of his shoulder . He was up in a second , but by this time the rest of the squad had rallied around to grab onto the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grunted and tossed them around like apples . Then , after a while , he stopped seeing red and sat down in a corner by himself to brood over the incident . When I heard about it and went in to talk to him , he was crying like a baby . " The fellows are all down on me , " he wept . The End of a Reign It was a hot night , and he had taken off his collar and tie and rolled up his sleeves . He sat next to an open window . The next morning the Rube could not raise his arm high enough to put on his collar . One morning about . a week later he came running into the office all excited , saying , " I was just shaving and something clicked in my shoulder . " I sent him out to toss up a few , but while he could put his arm through the motions he could n't put anything on the ball . . I did n't think that this was just another one of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sore arms . " Look at me , " he used to say . " I 'm out there tossing ' em up to the batters for seventeen or twenty innings at a clip and I 've never had one . " But this time he did . The team trainer worked on him with might and main , but I had to keep him out of the world series with the Giants , and I did n't miss him any more than Omaha needs his legs . We figured that McGraw 's men would n't like southpaw pitching , and we were going to use the Rube at least twice . He could always work out of turn and like it , and if he heat the Giants in his first start , he would have their number from then on . This took a lot of starch out of the rest of the team . The rumor mongers got in their dirty work then . It was soon noised around that the gamblers had got to the Rube . To anyone who knew him , that kind of story @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to him . He liked to win . Others said that it was all a plot on my part to throw the Giants off guard ; that there was really nothing wrong with the Rube , and that when the umpire stepped out with his cap in his hand , Waddell would turn a few cartwheels out to the mound . " Connie is trying to outsmart the Little Napoleon , " is the way some writers put it . I wish it had been true . The Rube pitched plenty of games for me after that , but be was never really right . I had to let him go in 1907 . The truth is the players themselves asked me to let him out . A committee of them waited on me . It , was their feeling that there had been so much publicity about the Rube 's habits that he was hurting the team . " The Rube is a great drawing card , " I told them . " Without him , the gate will fall off . If the gate falls off , I wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you boys are willing to take a cut in your salaries , I 'll let him go . " That threw a new light on it . The boys talked it over and decided that they weren't. quite so much embarrassed I as they had thought by being on the team with the notorious Rube Waddell . But . the whole thing came to a head hat fall . At the end of the season , seh  --  eek , Bender , Plank , Davis and Murphy , together with the Rube , de-tided to go on a barnstorming tour . They agreed that the take would n't be split , up until the tour was over , hoping in this way to keep the Rube in line . At Williamsport , Schrock was seized with a thirst . Big-hearted Rube took it upon himself to provide the wherewithal . The Rube had agreed to the postponement of the cut until after the tour , but he had n't taken it too seriously . It did not occur to him that his pals would refuse him a small advance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adamant . I never heard what was said or done , but I do know that the other members of the tour stuck together and outlasted the Rube . That was the final straw . After that , I knew I would either have to let him go or part with players like Bender and some others . I let him go to McAleer and St. Louis . I remember the first time we faced the Rube after the deal was put over . The boys were laying for him . They knew all his hag of tricks , they figured , and they would pin his ears hack for him . But . the Rube 's ears were stubborn . He struck out fifteen and licked us 5 to 3 that day . The Last Out The Rube 's end was a pathetic one . He was fishing near Minneapolis when he heard that a boy had been drowned in the lake the previous evening and the boy 's parents were frantic . because the body had not been recovered . He dove several times before he found the body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pneumonia , and the pneumonia left him with tuberculosis . He was sent to a sanatorium at the Hot Wells in San Antonio , Texas . A bunch of the boys  --  Donie Bush , Bill Donovan , Otto Williams , and baseball college at Hot Wells when they heard that Waddoll was a patient in the near-by hospital . When they came in , Waddoll was sleeping . They i did not recognize him . The man in the bed weighed not much more than a hundred pounds . Williams said , " It 's him all right . 1 can tell by the crease in his nose . " On the table beside the bed was a faded newspaper clipping showing the Rube and Ossie Schreck standing in their best bib and tucker and clutching traveling bags , all ready for a training trip . The caption under the picture was OFF TO THE BALMY SOUTH . A few days later , a nurse brought word that if they wanted to see Waddell again , they would have to hurry . When Waddell saw Williams , he whispered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breath and went on , " I 'll be over there tomorrow and show you hums how to run . I 've got my weight down to fighting trim now . " The Athletics helped bear the financial burden of the Rube 's last fight . We owed it to him . The Rube 's arno pulled us out of a tough spot in 1902 after the court decision that robbed us of Lajoie , Flick . Duggleby and others . In his second game for the Athletics , only twenty-seven men faced him in nine innings . The two men who got on base were both thrown out stealing . Schreck said that on the days when the Rube was right , his fast one had so much hop on it that he could see inches of daylight between the ball and the bat as the ball whizzed by . Personally eccentric , his control on the mound was extraordinary . In 1902 , in ten games , he fanned 106 men  --  an average of more than ten to a game . In 1903 , he fanned 130 men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men to a game . In 1904 , he struck out 343 men in 377 innings . But that . was n't the only reason you could n't help liking that guy . As one of the sports writers said of him , " There was a delicious humor in his vagaries , a vagabond impudence and ingenuousness that made them attractive to the public . " His attitude toward marriage was of a piece with the rest of his life . He dived into the waters of matrimony with great abandon and led an exciting home life , being in and out of hot water for nonsupport , and occasionally varying the monotony of wedded routine by shying a flat iron at one of his wives ' parents . Everything he touched reacted in key . When he went angling , he pulled in large strings of fish , usually of a kind never before found in the waters he worked . The Boy Who Never Grew Up I still preserve a clipping which purports to be the thoughts of Rube Wad-doll at a time when he was in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The words may be a reporter 's , but the spirit is his own : It was Mrs. Waddell who suffered from failing memory , not I. Instead of leaving her in hock in hotels , she left me to the mercy of the cold and heartless world , without a hotel to go in hock to . I had to wash my one pair of socks in a washbowl when 1 could borrow the bowl , and go to bed when I sent my shirt to the laundry . 1 will never forget that terrible winter . It was love alone that kept me from perishing . With all her faults , I am still hers truly . Mrs. Waddell recovered herlost memory early in the spring . She was the first person my eyes beheld on that first salary day , and she has been my porous plaster ever since . If I did n't love her so much. , I almost wish she would jump to an outlaw league . He loved adulation and the roar of the crowd . He lived for it . He pitched best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He loved to stand in the lobbies of hotels so that his fans might worship . Everywhere he went , an army of adoring kids followed him , and he was proud of their friendship . He was thirty-seven when he died . But he had never grown up . With all his faults , the Rube was a very great pitcher . say this for him : When he was right , we 've never had another who could touch him , and though many of my gray hairs can be traced to wondering where he was when his bed was empty , I never had a dull moment while he was on my pay roll .
