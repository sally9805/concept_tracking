A Better American Way with . Unemployment WITH smug complacency , the great men of Wall Street have recently ended a drive for $8,000,000 , with which they have put to work some 20,000 unemployed heads of families in the parks , in cleaning up vacant lots and in other - " made " jobs . It is not generous to deny the sort of - credit due to the charitable who have given to meet an emergency and relieve suffering . But we should have nothing but contempt for the veil of soft misrepresentation which has been thrown about these and similar proceedings . It is pretended that this is not charity ; that it proves that responsible leaders of American life stand ready to do everything necessary to meet the challenge of unemployment ; that the campaign represents adequate performance of a civic duty . When it began , speakers stated in so many words that if the goal were reached , : the danger of a " dole " would be averted . The very men who gave so readily are , most of them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remains that this charity is a dole . The fact remains that it belatedly offered succor to but 20,000 out of the minimum of 300,000 who are jobless in the city . The fact remains that , in spite of the heroic efforts of those who had to improvise methods of administering relief , it had the faults of hasty emergency action , as Sumner H. Slichter demonstrates in his article in this issue . Mr. Owen , D. Young , among others , said that this is the " American " way of doing things . If America can find no better way than this , intelligent Americans should be deeply ashamed . But we differ with Mr. Young . For seven years now there has been operating successfully in America a planned and systematized way of guarding against the misery of unemployment , a way which is not charity , which places the burden where it belongs ? upon industry itself ? and which is ade-quat e to care for most of the risks of the industrial group concerned . We refer to the unemployment insurance established by contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ manufacturers of Chicago . Here there is a well operated system of employment exchanges through which workers are regularly placed in any jobs which may be open , and at which the unavoidably unemployed are registered as a matter of routine . Here there is a fund , built up in good times as well as in bad , by regular contributions from employers and employees-3 percent of the pay roll contributed by the employers and 1% percent by the wage earners . The fund this year amounts to about one million dollars to cover the risks of some twenty thousand workers ( compare this with the $8,000,000 raised to meet the risks of several million workers in New York ) . Though the industry is not only subject to all the fluctuations of prosperity and depression , but to unusual sea , sonal variations as well , it has been taking care of its own this winter . Unemployed Chicago clothing workers have not had to stand all night in lines outside of hastily improvised relief bureaus . They have been enabled to live , and to contribute a regular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the planning and foresight of their own industry . They have been sustained , not by a charity drive , but because they have been recognized as essential partners in the productive organism , whose work will be needed again . The Industrial Relations Counsellors , a research agency closely associated with large capitalist interests , has conducted a careful survey of American experiments in systematic provisions against unemployment . Such plans , whether like that of the Amalgamated or like those adopted by employers alone , now apply to not many more than one hundred thousand workers . If we wait for industry to extend them on its own volition , it will be many years before they cover any large section of the wage earners , and even then the coverage will by no means be complete . The conclusion is clear that we need legislation to make the adoption of some such plan compulsory , just as we needed compulsory workmen 's compensation . There is no reason why the performance of the most backward industry should not in this respect be brought up to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ winter being introduced into some twenty state legislatures . It is of the utmost importance that some of these bills , at the least , be enacted into law at the present sessions . The laws need not be perfect . They need not offer the maximum amount of protection . Such laws would in any case be revised and improved as time goes on . But it is necessary to make a begin , . ning . And it is essential to make it now , while public attention is concentrated on the problem . Our behavior regarding measures against unemployment has hitherto been like that of the man who had a leaky roof which could not be mended during the rain and did not need mending when the sun shone . It will be argued that we must avoid hasty action , that we must do more research before passing laws . But the fact is that we have already delayed action on this matter until some eighteen other nations are ahead of us . Experts in this country have been doing research and thinking on the problem for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerning both foreign experience and experiments in this country . The American Association for Labor Legislation has been holding regular conferences of informed experts for months , as a result of which a tentative draft of an act has been prepared , as an " American Plan for Unemployment Reserve Funds . " We can not learn any more about the matter without legislative experience of our own . The introduction to this draft sets forth that its purpose is to provide unemployment-reserve funds to tide wage earners over periods of involuntary idleness , similar to the reserve funds out of which . dividends are now paid in slack periods . In order to finance a small benefit to the unemployed worker it provides for contributions to the fund from employers alone . The way is left open for contribui tions from employees as well , if fuller protection is desired . Certainly , if the state makes no contribution ? and it does not , under this bill ? there can be no question of a " dole . " But if any state wishes to share the burden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bill believe that they have remedied a defect in the British practice by placing the administration of the payments and the opera , tion of the employment offices necessary to the plan in the hands of the several industries ? under state supervision to guarantee minimum standards . This will furnish a greater motive for stabilization within each industry . The proposed boards are entitled " employment stabilization boards . " Employers who furnish proof of ability to pay the prescribed benefits or better , or who submit Plans which are at least as good as those specified in the act , are exempted from paying into the general fund . This gives ample leeway for other systems which have been or may be established byindustry ' itself . And the whole temper of the bill is sYlm pathetic to the current American doctrine that un ? employment is a problem of industry for which in industry should make itself responsible . prob . This act makes no pretense of solving the lem of unemployment . It rests on the reasonable assumption that any efforts to prevent de and stabilize industry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for years to come . Nor does it endeavor to compensate all those who may P05 ; sibly be unemployed . It merely provides a method of meeting , in a businesslike way , that part of the risk which is easily insurable . The insured must wait two weeks after their unemployment is established before drawing benefits . The maximum benefit which the law makes compulsory is $10 .3 week or 60 percent of weekly wages , whichever IS the lower . Benefits can be drawn for not more tha thirteen weeks in one calendar year . Only those , are eligible who have worked in the state for not less than twenty-six weeks during the two precedine years . Only those can draw payments wil ? , ale capable of and available for employment and are unable to obtain it in occupations for which they la if reasonably fitted . No one can be compensated eft he has lost his job through misconduct or has lelc. without reasonable cause or is out of work on on count of a strike or lockout . The burden the employer is trifling-1% @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wage increases if likely to average as much as this in any yearint any employer succeeds in stabilizing ! employ to a sufficient extent , he may receive dividends out of the fund . placed any ? back If this act were now in effect , there would still be plenty of opportunity left for the operation of Mr. Young 's " American way " of charity , or voluntary doles , or of any other extraordinary relief which might be devised . But millions of workers would have received , as soon as real need arose , and without charity by anyone , thirteen weeks ' benefits , up to $10 a week . How much this would have helped the " buy now " campaign , how much it would have lessened the strain on beneficence and on , organizations for social work , and above all , how much it would have done for the self-respect of the unemployed , the health of their children , and the morale of the nation as a whole , are matters not open to reasonable dispute .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
