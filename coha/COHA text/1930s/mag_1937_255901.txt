Four years ago a promising young physicist from the University of California , Ernest Orlando Lawrence , left his sunny campus and the ramshackle old building in which he was working , traveled eastward across the U. S. and across the Atlantic to attend a European scientific conference in Brussels . He was the only U. S. scientist invited . He had invented and was already making formidable use of a curious and powerful atomic weapon-a " cyclotron " that imparted great speeds to projectiles for smashing atoms by whirling them around in a strong magnetic field . <P> In Brussels was Britain 's gruff , burly Lord Ernest Rutherford , great formulator of the atom 's electrical structure , revered director of Cambridge University 's Cavendish Laboratory . Also on hand was one of Rutherford 's imaginative young workers , John Douglas Cockroft , who was at that time splitting lithium atoms by hurling protons at them . Cockroft energized his protons with high voltages obtained by transformers , rectifiers and condensers . <P> Cockroft realized the greater potentialities of the Lawrence machine , had tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In Brussels , Cockroft asked Lawrence to give the old physicist a sales talk . Lawrence assented . Lord Rutherford declared it to be one of his principles that the equipment used at Cavendish should be developed there . Young Dr. Lawrence made a quick-witted thrust : " Sir , you use spectrometers in the laboratory every day , but they were n't invented there , were they ? " <P> Two years ago Cambridge announced that it would build an atom-smasher of the Lawrence type . The Cavendish workers now expect their machine to be running in about a month . But Lord Rutherford will never see it start . He died last week , aged 66 , after failing to rally from an abdominal operation . His passing evoked expressions of grief and tribute from all over the scientific world . Said 80-year-old Sir J. J. Thomson , famed discoverer of the electron , who once was Rutherford 's teacher : ' ' His work was so great that it can not be compassed in a few words . His death is one of the greatest losses ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was one of the old pioneers in atomic physics and Ernest Orlando Lawrence is one of the new . Last week Lawrence was again traveling eastward , bound for Rochester , N. Y. where the National Academy of Sciences meets this week . Not only as the originator of the cyclotron but as the foremost U. S. destroyer and creator of atoms , the No. 1 U. S. investigator of artificial radioactivity and the headmaster of what is in effect a school for atomic physicists , he was to receive the Comstock Prize ( $2,500 and a certificate ) . With a membership limited to 300 , the National Academy is the lordliest body of scholars in the country and the Comstock Prize , its highest honor , is awarded only once every five years . In many quarters it is regarded as the highest U. S. scientific honor . <P> Atom Anatomy . The largest atom is only .00000001 inch in diameter , and many of the most important atoms handled by physicists are considerably smaller . An ancient Greek , Democritus , coined the word " atom " which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perfectly good name but for the past two decades , since the first atoms were sundered , it has been archaic.
