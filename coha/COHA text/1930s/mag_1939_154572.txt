In the late 1920s Founder Arthur J. Morris of the Morris Plan banks and four other members of a syndicate bought 14,550 shares of Industrial Finance Corp . stock from the late Pennsylvania Coalman John Markle . The price was $95 a share . It happened that Industrial Finance Corp. , parent of Morris Plan banks , was under obligation to repurchase that stock at $105 . Eventually the syndicate including Arthur Morris and four other directors of Industrial , sold the shares to the corporation , at a profit of $145,500 . <P> The deal was ancient financial history in 1936 when stockholders sued , claiming that the profit rightfully belonged to the company , not the directors in the syndicate . The members of the syndicate replied that the corporation neither wanted the stock nor was in a position to buy it and that the syndicate bought it to protect the corporation from Mr. Markle . Nonetheless , bushy-haired Justice Ferdinand Pecora returned a thumping judgment against Morris &; friends for $443,202 , including interest . Last week , Justice Pecora 's judgment having been reversed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Appeals ( last resort ) polished it off for good . In an unanimous decision six of its judges set aside Justice Pecora 's judgment , found nothing wrongful or improper in the deal .
