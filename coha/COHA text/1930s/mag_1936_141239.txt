Much in the news last week was James Henry Rand Jr. , bulky president of Remington-Rand Inc. , world 's biggest maker of office equipment . He became Samuel Insull 's first big radio customer , putting on a news program over the new Affiliated Broadcast Co. network ( TIME , Feb. 24 ) . He reported a $3,000,000 profit for his fiscal year through March , a whopping increase over the $1,750,000 earned the year before . And he settled to his satisfaction one of the most curious strikes in the history of U. S. Labor . <P> Called last month , the strike involved 6,500 workers in six Remington-Rand plants-Ilion , Tonawanda and Syracuse , N. Y. , Marietta and Norwood , Ohio and Middletown , Conn . By last week the strike had got down to scabs , scuffles , professional strikebreakers and pitched battles with police . Though President Rand considered it largely the work of Communists , the affair apparently originated last year when the company bought a factory in Elmira , N. Y. <P> The Elmira deal worried the 1,700 workers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rumors flew that the company planned to close down in Syracuse , move the portable division to Elmira . Union leaders wrote to President Rand , got no answer for a month . Then Mr. Rand 's secretary answered that no plans had been made for Elmira . <P> Early last month the suspicion that they might lose their jobs without warning had grown so strong among Syracuse unionites that they called a meeting , agreed it would be worth a strike to get the air cleared . Locals in the other plants voted to go along with them . After a fortnight 's silence , the company suddenly passed out ballots at all six plants with a warning reference to the Guffey decision ( TIME , May 25 ) . " The Supreme Court , " read the ballots , " decided that one group of employees can not dictate to any other workers . . . . Do you wish to strike or do you wish to work ? " At Syracuse the ballots also said : " The results of this ballot will determine continued operation of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with pay . <P> Balloting in Syracuse was blocked by the indignant union before it began . Promptly the plant manager posted notice of a two-week shutdown , fired 17 union leaders " for acting like Communists , " announced that the portable division would be moved , not to Elmira but to Ilion , leaving 800 Syracusans jobless . This looked remarkably like a lockout . <P> Sincerely alarmed , Syracuse 's Mayor Rolland B. Marvin telephoned Mr. Rand , got his assurance that the Syracuse plant would be reopened , that at least part of its $2,100,000 annual payroll would remain in Syracuse permanently if the workers knuckled down on the discharge of union leaders . Braving a booing , Mayor Marvin put Mr. Rand 's terms before the workers . They booed . The Mayor then went to New York to see Mr. Rand , returned to try another ballot . On the strength of some 400 votes the company declared the plant open a week after the closing . Less than a half-dozen workers got through a double file of 900 pickets . Meanwhile machinery was being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
