When not making pictures , cinema stars make headlines by marrying and divorcing , wooing and suing . When not making laws , members of Congress keep their names and causes before the public by Investigations . This summer these extracurricular activities will be fewer than usual because , in an election year , Congressmen want to be home mending fences . Also because of elections , investigations will be specially designed to provide useful political color . By last week three investigations of 1938 loomed largest : <P> TVA and the maze of charges and countercharges made by Messrs . Morgan . Morgan &; Lilienthal are being delved into by a joint committee headed by Ohio 's industrious , gum-chewing Senator Vic Donahey , with $50,000 to spend ( TIME , June 6 ) . Because Vic Donahey knows he is not a born inquisitor like such famed Senators as Black , Wheeler , Nye , La Follette and the late Tom Walsh , his committee last week retained a paid inquisitor just as the Senate 's Wall Street investigation in 1933-34 hired Lawyer Ferdinand Pecora . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a Philadelphia lawyer who followed Franklin Roosevelt through Groton and Harvard into the New Deal , served as chairman of NLRB in NRA days . Mr. Biddle , although once attorney for such great corporations as the Pennsylvania Railroad and A. &; P. chain stores , is an ardent New Dealer , hardly likely to bring much comfort to the private utilities which TVA opposes . His portrait , as a champion of social justice under the New Deal , was painted into a labor scene in one of the Department of Justice 's new murals by his brother , Artist George Biddle . <P> Reds &; Nazis and any other " unAmerican activities " he may find in the land will be the quarry of loud , towering , ham-handed Representative Martin Dies ( rhymes with " pies " ' ) of Texas . With him will work six House colleagues on an appropriation of $25,000 . To get his inquiry voted , Martin Dies ( whose hatred of communists is his political stock-in-trade in Texas ) enlisted the support of Representative Samuel Dickstein ( whose hatred of Nazis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) . Publicity-wise Mr. Dickstein , anxious to revive the Nazi-hunting committee he headed in 1936 , was glad to join Mr. Dies . They got their resolution passed-but when the committee was picked , angry Sam Dickstein was left off it . <P> Monopoly . By far the year 's most significant inquiry will be that of a National Economic Committee , set up by the Senate last week in response to a special message from President Roosevelt in April . Subject to approval by the House , after being rammed through over some serious Senate criticism , the N. E. C. will be composed of three Senators , three Representatives , an expert each from the Treasury , Justice , Labor and Commerce Departments , one each from SEC and FTC . The committee 's province as set forth in the resolution sponsored by Wyoming 's Senator O'Mahoney : <P> " To make a full and complete study and investigation ... of the concentration of economic power in and financial control over production and distribution of goods and services . <P> " The causes of such concentration and control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
