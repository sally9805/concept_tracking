In Manhattan American Airlines ' ticket offices were bedlams . <P> At one ticket counter a soft-voiced woman had the ear of a clerk . " Can I get two tickets to Boston ? " she inquired . The clerk asked who the other passenger was . <P> " He 's in a hearse outside , " the woman explained . The clerk 's eyes widened . " I must get him to Boston , " pleaded the woman , " his funeral 's tomorrow . " Too busy was the harried clerk to find out whether the woman had intended upending the cadaver in the other seat , or whether she supposed that airliners , like trains , carried baggage cars ahead . <P> More than 60% of the thousands who took to the air when last week 's wind and rain washed out transportation facilities on the eastern seaboard ( see p. 11 ) had never flown before . Between Manhattan and Boston , American Airlines , only line flying the 200 mile route , carries about 200 passengers on its ten scheduled flights back and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ following the hurricane 1,000 passengers were flown from Manhattan to Boston alone and perhaps half that number carried from Boston to Manhattan by a combined service of four lines . By this week approximately 60,000 Ibs. of express - serum , clothing , telephone repair apparatus , newspapers-and 57,000 Ibs. of mail had been flown into New England . <P> Grounded during the big blow itself , American Airlines started flying next morning . By 9 o'clock every scheduled flight was booked solid . By noon there was a waiting list of 800 . Unable to carry more than a small percentage of the demand , even by tripling its service , American Airlines got Civil Aeronautics Authority permission to waive its franchise , then asked other airlines to help out . United Air Lines , Eastern Airlines and Transcontinental &; Western Air pitched in . When at week 's end railroad grades and highways were got back into shape , other lines retired after the busiest spell of flying U. S. airlines had ever undertaken . <P> Significant was the pooling of equipment and the disregard of route franchises . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but never airlines . Ironic angle was that American Airlines , which last week showed the way for future interchange of air services , had only last year successfully opposed the plan of United Air Lines and Western Air Express to fly each other 's equipment-United Mainliners from Salt Lake City to Los Angeles , W. A. E. 's ships to Chicago-as a convenience to passengers who otherwise had to be routed out of sleeper berths at unearthly hours to change planes . Reason : such a pooling would have let unfranchised United ships into American-T . W. A.-monopolized Los Angeles .
