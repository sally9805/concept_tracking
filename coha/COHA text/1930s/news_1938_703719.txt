txt Spurred by evidence that the unmasking of F. Donald Coster , the ex-convict president of &; Robbins , Inc. , occurred at a time when he was in the midst of a deal in embargoed arms and amrnuni- ' tion , Federal authorities determined yesterday to concentrate their inquiry on that phase during the coming week . This decision was reached at a conference between Gregory F. Noonan and Irving S. Kaufman , assistant United States attorneys conducting an investigation into the fantastic and complex exploits of the brothers Musica , on the eve of another conference at which a plan for coordinated action by six Federal investigating agencies interested in the Musicas and their activities in &; Robbins will be sought . The coordinating session will be held at 2 P. M. today in the Federal Building , with Brian , Assistant - United States Attorney General , presiding . Body Is Taken to Brooklyn The body of Coster , or Philip Musica , who committed suicide in his home at Fairfield , Conn. , when his past caught up with him in overwhelming @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funeral establishment , and with the utmost secrecy surrounding burial plans , the body lay for a few hours with virtually no one but his widow , Mrs. Carol Jenkins Hubbard Coster , standing watch . Today George S. Dietrich , who was the assistant treasurer of &; Robbins and who was also George Musica before the family name transformations took place , will be brought back , under arrest , from his home also in Fairfield . In him centers one of the main lines of the arms inquiry , for to him was addressed a letter now in possession of the Federal authorities in which a man whose identity hasp not yet been learned asked &; Robbins to obtain for him 250,000 Lee-Enfield rifles of 1917-1918 manufacture and 250,000,000 rounds of ammunition for them , as well as bayonets and cleaning rods . While there was considerable speculation as to whether some of the $18,000,000 in missing assets of the &; Robbins company , discovery of which brought about the downfall of Coster and his brothers , might not have been paid out by them in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ identities , none of the many investigating agencies involved in the case could say that any evidence showing this to be a fact had been uncovered . Meanwhile the office of State Attorney General John 3 . Bennett Jr . also prepared to resume public hearings conducted by Assistant Attorney General Ambrose V. McCall under the Martin act to determine what , if any , frauds had been committed in the sale of securities by the company . John M. Kantor , the promoter who told the police that &; Robbins had offered to sell him 250,000 Lee-Enfields , continued in Tombs Prison , where it was regarded as likely that he would be held for several days for possible action about him as a fugitive from Connecticut on a swindling charge . Mr. Noonan and Mr. Kaufman , both frankly skeptical about the 250,000 figure as having any relation to reality , did not know whether Kantor would become an important figure in the inquiry or not . Fe has already been examined on the subject of arms but it was believed that further questioning of him would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ center of interest in a Canadian inquiry which will be resumed today in Montreal , where Kantor had an office , as did the fictitious firm of the W.

The Montreal address that Kantor gave on his arrest in New York could not be found either in the Montreal city directory or the tele-k phone book , but the Better Business Bureau of that city said it had received reports of activities of a man named Kantor who may have been the same person . A Montreal official who could not be named declared : " We have reason to believe that arms shipments passed through Montreal but can not be sure until the investigation is completed . " The presence of Kantor in New York , the date of the letter to &; Robbins for the attention of George Dietrich , which was June 18 , and several other factors convinced the Federal attorneys that the arms angle.of the Coster-Musica case was probably the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity of rifles could be obtained in the United States without large-scale thefts from the United States Army stores , especially in Springfield , Mass. , and Rock Island , Ill. , the Federal authorities nevertheless had enough information to make them believe that it would be advisable to shelve temporarily all other aspects of the DO NOT FORGET The Hundred Neediest Mr. will arrive from Washington by airplane at Newark Airport at 11:20 A. M. today . The conference at the Federal Building will be held at 2 P. M. At it will be representatives of the three investigative agencies of the Treasury Department , which are the alcohol and Income tax units and the narcotics division ; representatives of the Federal Bureau ; of Investigation , the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Postofnee Department . As Mr. ** explained it in a telephone interview in Washington yesterday , the purpose of the session is purely one of coordinating the work . There is , " he said , " only one set of books of the company , I assume , and certainly there is only one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the government agencies interested in this case will want to see the same books and to examine the same witnesses at the same time that prompts the conference . " It appeared likely that the extremely unusual procedure of an investigating committee made up of representatives of each of the departments and working as a unit would emerge as the result of the session . Such a committee could settle down with its various members pursuing the angles they were particularly interested in as the occasion arose . This committee , if it does emerge , will have no effect on , but will be somewhat subsidiary to , the prosecution and grand jury presentation aspects of the work to be done by the United States Attorney 's office . This will continue in the hands of , . Mr. Noonan , Mr. Kaufman
