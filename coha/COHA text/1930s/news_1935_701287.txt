Y. , this week criticize the discriminatory features of Canada 's tariff as against the United States they opened up a difficult subject . It is deeply imbedded in the whole history of CanadianAmerican relations . It has long been one of the vital political issues in Canada itself and since Canadians themselves do not agree about it , agreement between Canadians and Americans is scarcely to be expected . That their mutual tariffs have vexed the relations of the two PRIME MINISTER Associated Press . Premier Bennett of Canada , who has stood for high tariff . neighbor countries is beyond doubt . Where the blame lies is not lightly to say . In Canada 's youth the American market was a matter of life or death to her and the termination by the United States Government in 1866 of the reciprocity agreement which had been in force since 1851 was a staggering blow . Canadian statesmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the opening of the twentieth century when Canada began to find her own feet and , In her new self-confidence , to render herself more and more independent of her big neighbor . Finally , in 1911 , she rejected an offer of that reciprocity which she had so long vainly sought . But her commerce with the United States , stimulated by the Underwood tariff of 1913 , steadily improved and in 1929 Canada and the United States were doing the greatest two-country trade in the world . The trade between them in that year was $1,389,000,000 . In 1933 it had sunk to $381,077,000 , or less than a third . Few in either country would be willing to blame this enormous shrinkage wholly on the depression . The first step toward curtailing this commerce by fiscal action was taken by the United States , which , in 1930 , built by Means of the Hawley-Smoot tariff one of the highest trade fences in the world . That administrated the quietus to Canada 's export of cattle and some other agricultural products so far as these bad survived the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States had a " favorable balance " of trade with Canada of $347,000,000 offset only to the extent of some $200,000 , - 000 by tourist traffic , the HawleySmoot tariff might be called a short-sighted step to take against her then best customer . It is arguable , however , that Canada 's answer , which came in 1930 , 1931 and 1932 in the shape of three separate elevations of the Dominion 's tariff schedules , outdid the provocation . Canada 's present tariff is twice as high as any she ever had before and its lofty schedules have been supplemented by various administrative devices which have provided effective , if somewhat surreptitious , obstructions to American trade . The Liberal budget of 1930 , it was estimated , would divert large amounts of Canadian trade from the United States to Great Britain . A few months later the Conservative administration of Prime Minister Bennett came to power on the issue of still higher tariffs against the United States . Duties Doubled by Bennett . Mr. Bennett immediately doubled the duties on a wide range of commodities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ effect of Canada 's Customs Act . In years past that act had contained a dumping clause directed and applied only against goods sold at lower prices in Canada than in the country of origin . But under Mr. Bennett 's administration the Minister of Customs was authorized to fix arbitrary valuations on goods whose importation into Canada might " prejudicially or injuriously affect the interests of Canadian producers " and apply the dumping duty if the import price were lower . The dumping duty was later invoked against countries with depreciated currencies , and when the American dollar went for a time to a 2 to 3 per cent discount this duty was promptly applied against American imports . The crux of the trouble seems to be that for lack of other instruments the Canadian tariff has been used as a means of providing unemployment relief protection , rectification of the country 's balance of payments , and even direct control of its exchange . Public opinion in Canada is now overwhelmingly in favor of lowering it .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
