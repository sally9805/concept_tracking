WEEK-END A STORY BY BESSIE BREUER T HE summer lay before her , smooth and shining , untouched , each day to be imprinted with the delicate happiness of being alone together in a country and in a house that like a dream closed round them an artist and an artist 's wife . All the things she had wondered about all her young days and thoughtlessly yearned for , unable to spell through to the mysteries of painting , save in wishing to be near the life creating it , were to be hers . She had the life , more wonderful , more miraculous , and more simple than any painting , the free , the private life ; the lovely house just made for their young love , the lovely land . She gathered the goldenrod flushing the fields just outside her door  --  to have as much as she wanted , not just a few scentless things sent in by the corner florist  --  and she carried stacks of it back to the kitchen , all her own , the wood table , blond @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ touch . She had never noticed these things before she lived with Edgar . He was teaching her to know the world she had lived in blindly so many years  --  the miracles of common things . She ran water into the ample-bellied mustard-colored bowl , plunged the sticky , the strawy brittle stems into the dark wetness , ripping off the encumbering leaves with a rough , voluptuous carelessness . The water running over left a deepbrown spreading circle staining the tawny table . And no matter for alarm that either  --  all the days to run to this deeply stirring , upheld quietness , bright and still , day piling on day , scarcely measured , scarcely felt , like soft down piled on down . The long , dark living room lay like a cool dream , shot with stripes of sun angling through the long windows  --  high lights on the dark table . The little objects she arranged and rearranged to have more fun . Heaven on earth , they called it . Beyond in the studio Edgar was painting some flowers she had carelessly arranged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still life , immortalizing her artistry , he had said , laughing and kissing her , and whispered , But truly , dear , we hope ? " She had always had a little foolish passion for fussing , her mother called it , with things , moving them around ; chairs , tables , and pictures , bunching flowers , enduring the patient complaint of her mother and the tiny jests of her father . Minerva 's little funny tricks , they said . Now , she could put odd bits of material , lovely things she had picked from counters just because she liked the odd color or because the design held her . She could play with them in her own home . She could dress herself up , not in nice , ladylike things , but funny , nice little things she made herself out of a few yards of fifteen-cent calico ? " This is the sort of thing you should wear , " Edgar said , approving . She was forever surprised and shocked and delighted at the way her husband dismissed those very lovely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dear . So ordinary and so vulgar  --  so ordinary , he said , just like millions of other little rich girls , he had said . He had thrown that girl away and brought forth to life that other person who hid beneath , the girl who saw the heavy velvet wonder of scarlet tomatoes and brought them into the living room on a lovely green plate instead of shutting them away in the dark , damp vegetable bin . All the little traits she had hid away , Minerva 's funny little tricks , were now brought out into the sunlight , caught and held to happiness by her husband 's delightful appreciation . That was the wonder of his loving her . He would say , coining in just as she had carelessly placed a green melon and some yellowish unripe pears together in an old wooden bowl , " That 's beautiful , darling . Do n't touch it . I 'll paint it . " And she would have to leave it like that . He would bring his paints and easel and canvas into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ living room , happy , so happy sharing his work . Beauty she was , Edgar said . Beauty itself . Not her face or her body alone . Just the soul of beauty , all these little ways of daily living . Put on canvas they made art . That was what Cezanne and all the rest of them had seen , a woman peeling potatoes , a field , a woman ironing . That was beauty . Oh , the wonder and the richness of her new life ! She pitied her mother . The satin coverlets on her mother 's day-lounge , the numberless little lace and embroidery pillows , the fretting and spying about servants . Her mother had been dismayed when she had first come out to the little house at the broad plank floors , scrubbed clean , the rough stone walls , the sparse simple furniture . She bad shuddered a bit , then said gaily , " It will be just like camping , Minerva . " And she had come out with the chauffeur and Lena to help her daughter along . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the servants , explaining things to her mother , her home and not hers as long as they were in it . It was really a tiny house , just big enough for two  --  and a guest . So she had had to move things around . She and Edgar had made up a couch in the studio , giving their bedroom to father and mother . The servants  --  man and wife luckily  --  squeezed into the tiny guest room . It made the house all different , little and squeezed and inconvenient . Its soul just walked out of it . All the things which made it lovely just for the right two made it inconvenient and awkward for two more and their servants . The alcove sort of kitchen , meant hardly to separate the wife who cooked from the husband who worked , gave them no liberty from the servants . It was n't so bad when you were moving about . Yet really it was , too , always to be conscious that they were hearing every word ; still one could retreat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two servants eating and murmuring just around the bend in the wall , and they too murmured and said nothings , their minds half on what was going on in the kitchen . " No privacy , " said Edgar , retreating to the studio and not coming out except at mealtime . It was n't fair of him , she thought , to leave all the adjustments to her . He might realize how hard it was for her to be host to her own mother and father and yet not host  --  a funny situation , to have to bend to their every well-meant suggestion because , after all , it was their present and they were paying for it . They had given them the house and the summer , and she was really very grateful . Her father did n't approve of Edgar 's painting , but he had given them the summer , and then if Edgar 's painting did n't sell , he 'd have to go to work in the office . It was n't the same , of course , as being alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Edgar retreated from her , just sitting and staring at his canvas or going off to sketch by himself and coming back with nothing , or puttering about , smoking endlessly , being nice enough in a formal way to her parents , but a worried pucker always between his eyes ; the laughter , the quick fun gone  --  like the house itself , a stranger . They were to leave Monday morning . When all the bags were packed and placed just so in the car ; when the dark , polite , too polite servants in black had finally got past the door and sat frozen yet alive in the car , and she had again and again reassured her mother that she would manage , that she would not work too hard , that she would take care of herself , Father said , " She 's never done a thing before , " his look flicking the young man . Oh , would they never stop rubbing in his ignominy and his helplessness ! They had been through all that time after time before she married @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ love housework . It 's more fun than anything I 've ever done before , " she cried sharply . Finally the last wave of the hand , the last good-by as the car turned into the main road . What a let-down ! As though one had been on a bat and felt guilty , she thought as she turned back to the empty house . They went in ; it was so suddenly bare , empty of the dark , heavy f , rms that had filled it , it seemed just a dark , empty , rough barn of a place . The kitchen was piled with dishes , and the table in the living room too . They had had to make an earlystart so that her father could get to the office on time . It was noon before everything was cleared and cleaned , before they had moved their things back into their bedroom again . It was night before the strangeness wore out of the house and it took on the appearance and the feeling of lovely carelessness and richness again . The maid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with prim , frowning severity , set the candelabras and lamps neatly in a row on the mantel . A whole day lost again , she said to Edgar . Lost again and never to come back , he spluttered violently . A whole day ? A Friday , Saturday , Sunday , and Monday --  four days , no work , his mood busted completely , he said . The same thing happened last week and two weeks ago . " If your people keep these benevolent visits up , the summer 's shot to hell for me , and my work 's done for . " His work , more precious , more near the center of his life than she ! Jealous and hurt , she answered , " They mean well . " " Yes , the benevolence of rich despots is always well-meaning and invariably destructive of art . You have to pay for it with your life  --  the only coin they are interested in . " She said nothing , and they went to bed , silent , each hugging his side of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dawn over the dark hills gave them back their own quietness and magic again . The still dawn washed her into his arms again . How strange marriage was that it should make her over in two short months into a being forever different and apart from the two people she had known and loved for twenty-four years ! Now they were really strangers to her , to her life and her mood . Her very body , long and delicate and sharp , was softened to roundness by the golden man by her side . Now alone , naked , they ran down to the brook . Naked and alone in their very own woods , in their very own stream . Cold the water , and yet giving back heat for cold , heat springing from the veins , flushing their white bodies and making them shout and jump and run , racing to the house , yelling with exultation . Mother would be shocked at the very idea , she thought mischievously as she dressed rapidly . She half-wished that her mother could have seen them that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding , final and lifelong , of what she in her own self was and what she loved ? not forever half-hiding the truth of the brutal and lovely realities of her new life . She felt that she already knew and experienced a world of sensations , physical and spiritual , that had never touched her mother , virginal and innocent and narrow and pure . They raced getting dressed ; this time she beat and ran down to the kitchen . Sweet kitchen , sweet place for mc alone , she exulted , for mc and my life  --  as long as these days last . I shall make them perfect . I shall keep your kettle boiling and your hearth swept clean . I shall brush the cobwebs from the walls . In these little ways I shall weave the song of your loveliness . A. song you will remember long when I am gone , but never gone , really , never in this life , she sang , meanwhile plumping the grapefruit heavily on the table and cutting it tenderly . Ile loved grapefruit . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very own and different from the coffee made by unloving servants ' hands , hot and clear , and now she fairly ran into the living room and shoved a little table to the open sunny bay of French windows  --  a lovely cloth she would lay , her prettiest one , the dark coffee-colored linen square with the heavy rough lace edge . She stepped out the window and intothe garden for a few narcissuses to stick in a long green Murano glass . She surveyed the whole scene , delicate and beautiful , bathed in sun and freshness , like their love . " Hurry , " she called . " Breakfast . It 's a party for just us . " She , the helpless one , always catered to , placed their chairs , brought the coffee to her blond god , this creature come out of his week-end moodiness , her lover come back to her . " This is heaven , " he said and again , " Heaven , " and kissed her hands . Oh , sweet life again . Heaven with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Heaven , the silence . Heaven , his hands touching hers . Heaven , the food . Heaven on earth he had made for her , just a spoiled rich girl living in a duplex apartment on Park Avenue , going to Europe every year , visiting art galleries with a special guide ( she flushed at the memory as at some dark vulgarity ) , going the cultural rounds with her kind , her lost and gentle mother . The lessons in art , in dancing , in piano , all meaningless . And her empty , wondering life , until this happened . Heaven , and a new sharp meaning to life from this queer , beautiful and moody young man . . . . Wednesday , Thursday , and again their own life gathered into its accustomed tempo , sang for them . Friday morning early the telephone , seldom calling them , rang . She answered . There was a pause . " New York calling , " she said to her husband . He frowned . Sweetly , politely she spoke her words then faced @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she said . " Until Monday ? " he asked quietly , terribly . " Yes . And they 're bringing Aunt Fanny , who is up from Richmond . " " Charming , : ' he said . " Charming . " Open sesame . Close sesame . Like magic the house grew dark to them , although if they had noticed it , the sun was shining as brightly as before . They wasted the day , nervous , irritable , eating their dinner half abstractedly , with somewhat the air of criminals waiting for the bailiff , waiting to hear the soft sudden buzz of a motor car into their quiet woods , the quick knock and the door opening even before the answer on two impassive faces , the bringers of doom , Mr. and Mrs. Coakley , chauffeur and cook , strict Presbyterians , who did not even greet them , loaded up to the eyes with bags , which they set down inside the door , going out into the dark for more . And then the loud , cheerful voice of Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , tall and breezy , filling the door , the room , cheerful with love of himself for his immense power , for his goodness to his daughter . Kissing his daughter , he called back , " Careful down the steps there , Aunt Fanny . " Aunt Fanny , a large , white , helpless woman , and Mother , piloting her , Mother a bit tired , and anxious about everything . The murmurs and movements of five persons settling themselves into their own haunts , taking possession of their little corners . Mother , finally finished with settling Aunt Fanny for the night , coming down to the table with an armful of paper napkins , saying , " How did you manage all week without help ? But now , thank goodness , we 'll take care of you for a few days . " Undoing a package , she began to fold the paper napkins in it . " We might as well have these ready , " she said , " even though we are roughing it ; there is plenty to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ working away rapidly , and no one offering to help " Have a cigar , Edgar , " said Father , making himself comfortable in the easy chair he had sent out from town because there was not one chair here a per- ? son could take his ease in . He brought out his market reports , set the portable radio at his elbow to bleating and blubbering , and the week-end was on . " Well , how 's the art coming on ? " he asked his son-in-law . " Got some stuff finished that 'll make a bang ? You ought to have a pile of pictures done by now . I wish I had your luck . Nothing to do but slap on paint all day long . " Harmless enough , he thought his son-in-law . Queer fellow , the last person he 'd pick out to be in his family . But Minerva had met him somewhere around with her friends . You never know what those kids run into or where they go . Women are queer , all of them . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you never know what your own wife is , come to that . Well , he 'd see them through the summer , give them this freedom to be artists they talked so much about . But if he did n't come through and make money with his pictures he 'd have to go into the office . He drew a deep breath of satisfaction . Anyhow the girl was looking good . He did n't know any other man who would have stood for such nonsense , when there had been plenty of chaps who could take good care of her , always after her , too . Maybe he 'd been a fool to give in , but he 'd always been a fool about her , given her every advantage , tutors , clothes , her own car , everything , and then she picks up this penniless fellow  --  an artist of all things  --  and got so sick , and so stubborn he had to give in , or he did n't know what would have happened to her . Funny thing , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as the devil on her . Good thing they brought Lena and Gordon . They helped out a lot over the week-end . The poor kid could n't manage alone . Plucky , used to a house full of servants to do for her , and now holding the fort all by herself . Funny how he had got to like coming out and puttering about the place , going to the village and picking the food off the shelves in the grocery store and adding it up and paying for it all by himself . He liked it all , the house , the country , the little village . Might not be such a bad idea to spend a few weeks here this summer . No fuss , no dressing up , no bother of country clubs ; and they could be with Minerva , just living the quiet life . Better than going up to Maine , or even Carlsbad . He felt better here . Braced him up , this puttering around the place . He warmed up . Yes , come to think of it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring the servants out , and it would be a rest for Minerva . They 'd rough it . And mother could come east and stay out there with them . She was getting old and was lonesome for him . They 'd manage . She liked the country , just roughing it . His thoughts drifted lazily with the ebb and flow of his cigar . How pretty that girl of his was , sitting there , a married woman . A married woman . It gave him a queer feeling . She looked suddenly tired , poor kid , working too hard . " How long are you staying ? " she asked quietly . She seemed tired , poor kid , and sad . Overdoing it . He took in her suspended , anxious face . Lean , dark , beautiful . Got race , by God ! Looks like me . " Why , I expect till Tuesday , " he answered . " Yes , I can stay this time till Tuesday . They 'll telephone me if anything breaks . Pretty nice , is n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she answered . Gone Minerva 's summer , gone their one chance . " Yes , it will be nice , " her mother echoed .
