When the Japanese imitate , they either improve on the original or make it look silly ; either undersell U. S. fountain pens in a shop three miles from the factory where the U. S. pens are made , or launch a battleship which turns turtle . Last week a Japanese imitation in the field of diplomacy turned out to be ludicrously no-good goods . <P> When Japan 's best friend , Adolf Hitler , invited Japan to send some personal guests to the Nrnberg Congress , Japanese saw a chance to adopt the Western vogue of sending econo-military missions to friendly nations , picked four really important men to go . In order not to hurt the Little Brother of the Axis , they would travel to Germany via Italy . They set out in July . But it is a long way from Tokyo to Rome , and while the mission was on the high seas , Adolf Hitler proved what seemed a sorry friend . Last week there arrived in Rome four puzzled , embarrassed wandering minstrels of Japan , four doves of peace with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 60 , represented the Japanese Army . Once military attache in Berlin , now a member of the Supreme War Council , he was loved by the Army 's ambitious young officers when he commanded the North China forces ( August 1937 to December 1938 ) , because when they told him to let them run things , he did it gracefully . He read the classics , sometimes went for an airplane ride , agreed not to play golf but bustled with pretended business . But though amenable , he is aggressive . Once he got a letter from the Towada Branch of the Glossy Head Society , saying that members had seen and admired his excellency 's pate , considered it a " perfect model in our category No. 4-general retreat . " Said the General : " The society thinks my hair has retreated ; I think the smoothy ground has attacked . " He was shocked to hear that the Nrnberg Congress had been called off , swallowed hard when he remembered his proud statement to the Japanese press the day of his departure : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Italy-the three strong countries of the world-at a time when there is a social emergency , will not be without significance . " <P> Admiral Baron Mineo ( means " born-on-a-mountain-peak , " as he was ) Osumi , 63 , another member of the Supreme War Council , naval attache in Berlin just before World War I , twice Navy minister , veteran of Manchurian and Shanghai warfare , was there for the Navy . He likes to wrestle with his two sons , says he lives in constant admiration of the three monkeys who cover mouth , ears , eyes . He is intensely loyal . Once when a drunken friend fell into a ditch , Admiral Osumi crawled in after him " to divide humiliated feeling with his clique . " <P> Takashi Isaka , 69 , president of the Tokyo Gas Co. , represented business interests . He was chosen because he had been in Germany three times before . Mr. Isaka , too , gave an interview to the press on his departure from Japan . He said he regretted Japan 's anti-Britfsh campaign . His @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today may prove enemies of tomorrow .
