When the Supreme Court invalidated Section 9c of NIRA last fortnight , it was dourly predicted that the oil industry would swiftly revert to pre-Rooseveltian chaos , that a flood of East Texas " hot oil " would sweep the price of crude down from $1 per bbl. to 25 . <P> As headlines died away and the price of crude remained at $1 , it became clear last week that the Supreme Court 's first anti-New Deal decision was more of a warning to Congress than it was a painful upset to the nation 's oil men ( see p. 17 ) . <P> Only immediate result was retirement from the East Texas fields of the Federal Tender Board , which had executed President Roosevelt 's unconstitutional ban on interstate shipments of hot oil . Its retirement , however , was by no means the signal for reopening every secret valve and bypass . A stronger Texas hot oil law went into action on Christmas Day , and despite the thuggery , bribery , judicial connivance and wholesale corruption that taint most oil operations in the East @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . <P> The gasoline market was jittery and hot oil shipments increased slightly but the flood of illegal oil which had been predicted failed to materialize . Word was passed to the big hot-oilers to keep the field quiet while legislation was pending in Washington . Bitterly opposed to Federal regulation , Texas was on its best behavior . <P> Furthermore , the Oil Code , undisturbed by the Supreme Court 's decision , was still in force . That code was supposed to outlaw hot oil but , through an " error " which was not discovered for nearly a year , the pertinent section was missing from certified official copies . <P> The Administration , however , has no intention of confining its strenuous strivings for Federal regulation of a great natural resource to a mere code . But Vice President Garner and some of Mr. Roosevelt 's best legislative friends are good Texas Democrats who mortally hate &; fear the thought of Federal meddling in their State 's biggest business . It was the Texas delegation that succeeded in shelving the toothy Thomas-Disney oil control bill in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' Congressman Sam Rayburn , who chairmans the powerful House Interstate Commerce Committee , took time out to thunder : " I will not vote to make one man dictator of the third largest industry in the U. S. " <P> There was talk of declaring the oil industry a public utility but , while admitting that the idea had occurred to him , President Roosevelt indicated that he would first try a less earth-shaking method of regulation . Production control by interstate pacts , the industry 's own nostrum now being advocated by Oklahoma 's Governor Marland , seemed out as far as Washington was concerned . Senator Tom Connally of Texas , who fell over himself last year declining the honor of sponsoring the Administration 's oil measure , introduced a joint resolution to provide the Government with a valid basis for reinforcing State proration laws at State lines . But what the President really wants is the power to 1 ) fix production quotas by States , 2 ) regulate interstate oil traffic and , if these fail , 3 ) to step into any oil State and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
