Into the black sky above the Hollywood Bowl in Hollywood , Calif , four great searchlights stabbed . They stood like steady swords of light-or like the beams thrown up at Germany 's annual Nuremberg Party Congresses . But these four rays signalled the four standards of Moral Re-Armament : Absolute Honesty , Purity , Unselfishness , Love . MRA , launched in the East this spring , had been brought to the West Coast by Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman and 1,000 followers , many of whom traveled across the land on a 22-car " MRA Special . " In the Hollywood Bowl , the Buchmanites sat on the stage beneath the acoustic shell newly labeled NEW MEN . . . NEW NATIONS . . . A NEW WORLD . To see and hear them , 25,000 Southern Californians jammed the Bowl , 10,000 more were turned away . <P> Said Frank Buchman : ' ' Tonight you are going to witness the preview of a new world order . " To anyone who had ever attended a Buchmanite meeting , the preview itself was not new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ M. G. M. 's Louis Burt Mayer spoke up for MRA-as Cinema Tsar Will H. Hays had done at a luncheon given by Mr. Mayer for the Buchmanites . Henry Ford sent a message , publicly endorsing Dr. Buchman and his work by name . Herbert Hoover furnished some words about the world 's troubles , which headline writers construed as praise for MRA ; thereupon Mr. Hoover let it be known that he neither endorsed MRA nor denied endorsing it . Read again was the message President Roosevelt sent a recent MRA meeting in Washington . Thirty-three U. S. Governors let their names be used as subscribing to a statement that " Moral Re-Armament is our most urgent need . " <P> Among the Buchmanite testifiers who told the Bowl meeting how MRA had helped them were two whose appearance was , to the Los Angeles Evening News , " almost painfully exquisite . " They were a Chinese girl , a Japanese man who , after speaking their pieces , shook hands , stood silently smiling . The Bowl audience , predominantly middleclass , was equally pleased when Charles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( A. F. of L. ) , vowed his friendship for G. G. Bennett , president of the Imperial Valley branch of the reactionary Associated Farmers . <P> Aside from the Teamsters ' Union , California labor was not represented at the meeting . C. I. O. leaders believe that Mr. Copperman 's Union , once aggressive , was taken into camp by MRA . And Californians recall how , five years ago , Buchmanites claimed they had " settled " the longshoremen 's strike , " the first strike in history in which Christ was called upon to act as arbiter . " That strike went on long after Buchmanites had been guided to urge the longshoremen to forget their troubles , go back to work . <P> From Hollywood , Dr. Buchman journeyed to Del Monte , opened a " World Assembly " for MRA , attended by 2,000 delegates from 25 nations . Said he : " We must possess some superior quality , a quality of living that rises above resentment , jealousy , greed and points of view , because all these may keep us from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same characteristics that distinguish a great general-the plus of character , the plus that will change the world . "
