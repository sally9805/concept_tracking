Wall Street last week beheld an unusual sight-Mrs . Vincent Astor , slim and chic , standing on the running board of a large yellow automobile shaking a coin box , begging contributions . <P> This was not the Depression 's last paradox . Mrs. Polly Lauder Tunney was similarly begging uptown on the steps of the Public Library . Over the radio , trim Mrs. Charles Hamilton Sabin , wife of the board chairman of potent Guaranty Trust Co. , was exhorting a national audience , . So was intense little Mrs. Archibald Roosevelt . Out on Long Island and up in the fashionable suburbs of Westchester and Connecticut , scores and scores of well-dressed ladies , wives of substantial , responsible businessmen , were earnestly parading the streets and highways in their family automobiles , blaring their horns steadily with large blue &; white banners proclaiming that the 18th Amendment must be repealed . It was " National Repeal Week , " sponsored by the Women 's Organization for National Prohibition Reform of which Mrs. Sabin is national chairman , Mrs. Roosevelt campaign chief . After @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to smoke cigarets in conservative districts , the suburban ladies returned to make streetcorner speeches patterned after Mrs. Sabin 's radio address . Excerpts from the latter : <P> " When I speak of changed and changing attitudes toward Prohibition I can not help thinking about the word ' Wet , ' and how different is its meaning today from what it was intended when first the term was hurled at the opponents of the 18th Amendment . It was intended to be an insult , a sneer , or at best a flippancy . It was intended to indicate a person of uncontrolled appetite , a poor creature who placed thirst ahead of responsibility to his neighbor . <P> " Some of us women shrank from the characterization , were indignant about the injustice of it . We tried to think of ways to persuade public and press to give us a fairer , more accurate description . We failed . ' Wet ' was brief , ' Wet ' was easy , ' Wet ' would fit neatly into headlines . And so we were fated to be ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . <P> " In the circumstances there was only one thing to do . That was to convert the term of contempt and reproach into a term of distinction . . . . When the Dutch settlers of New York called their neighbors to the North ' Yankees ' they thought they were speaking derisively . But who is ashamed of being a Yankee today ? " *
