Last week saw the great offensive of Europe 's new war . It is the war of menace and mystery , of hysteria , panic , rumor , aimed at shattering an enemy 's morale as big guns shatter a fort . Last week saw the biggest battle of the war-the battle of Danzig on the Vistula , where Nazi forces had been stalemated four months by the imperturbable resistance of its Polish defenders . <P> There is little heroic in a war of nerves . Its assaults are vicious whispers and strident insults , currency raids , press bombardments , radio tirades ; its triumphs have scarcely more grandeur than a nervous breakdown . <P> But last week 's offensive had the sweep of a great military campaign . Resistance to it had a kind of heroism in its stolid refusal to give way to alarm . As the week wore on the grand strategy of the Axis high command became clear . Main objective was Danzig , on which the German press poured a steady fire . But as Grant pounded Richmond while Sherman swept through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the war of nerves was launched simultaneously on two fronts : Poland was attacked by the main army while in the Balkans assaults , feints , raids , tested the strength of the defenders . Thus it appeared that if Poland did not give way , Germany could move southeast ; if Poland gave way there could be a general advance on all fronts . And like the advance forces of an army feeling out the strength of enemy positions , the purpose of the offensive was clear : it partially masked a surprise move that its directing genius had on hand ; it tested each sector of the Polish , French , English defense . <P> But Poland did not give way . In seven days incidents and insults mounted to staggering proportions . A Polish soldier was shot because he blundered over the invisible line , as deadly as a high tension wire , that separates Poland and Danzig ; two customs officers were hauled in by Danzig police ; a Polish passport office was raided . <P> Warsaw struck back , arrested the Nazi leader of Polish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung troops into Slovakia , P'o-land 's Ambassador to the U. S. , Count Jerzy Potocki , summed up Polish feeling in Washington : " Just as surely as you see me sitting here there will be a general war if Germany attempts to change the status of Danzig . " Member of one of the few great Polish landowning families that fought for Polish independence , blond , fox-hunting Count Potocki had been so completely tagged as Washington 's leading diplomatic socialite that his grim warning surprised reporters . Said Count Potocki : " Herr von Ribbentrop created Europe 's crisis by persuading Fuhrer Hitler that Britain would not fight , ignoring Britain 's realization since Munich that surrender would not mean peace . " <P> Nor in the Balkans did the great offensive of the war of nerves find a soft spot in the defense . In Rumania , King Carol made a speech of surprising firmness , declaring that Rumanian frontiers could not be changed . In Yugoslavia , Croats and Serbs gave promise of ending their feud . <P> The main battle against Poland settled to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ progress .
