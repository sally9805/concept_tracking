txt Mayor O'Brien has called a special meeting of the Board of Estimate for next Wednesday to consider a ten-cent toll on the four East River bridges and a five-cent tax on all taxicab rides . He acted soon after the publication yesterday of a letter from Samuel Untermyer to Controller Charles W. Berry , warning against a probable default in the city 's obligations to holders of its securities unless substantial new revenues were made available soon . Mr. Untermyer also conferred with the Mayor as Mr. Barry 's emissary . The two proposals were contained in Mr. Untermyer 's letter , which was written after an investigation of the city 's fiscal outlook for June . The investigation was made at Controller Berry 's request and as his counsel , without fee . The letter also urged Controller Berry to seek to get the Board of Estimate to adopt several economy proposals recently made by the Citizens Budget Commission . Among these were the broader sale of " baby bonds " to be used in payment of taxes ; the elimination of useless city jobs in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the temporary suspension of mandatory salary increases . In his analysis of the city 's fiscal position for June , Mr. Untermyer found that the great stumblingblock was the requirement of $25 , - 000,000 for relief . The banks , he declared , were said to be willing to renew the short-term securities falling due during June , except for several items which the city will be in a position to redeem In cash . ' Linter/foyer Move Fomented . Mayor O'Brien declined to comment on Mr. Untermyer 's proposals or upon Controller Berry 's action in seeking aid from one who recently accused Tammany Hall of misgoverning the city . Mr. tintermyer 's letter was not considered by the Board of Estimate at the executive session yesterday , he declared , although it was displayed by Controller Berry . There wercl no copies available for the board ' members , Mayor O'Brien said . It was understood , however , that Mayor O'Brien was informed of the contents before it was made public . It was reported , in fact , that not only Mayor O'Brien but also other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session that they resented Controller Berry 's action in retainiing Mr. Untermyer as an adviser on fiscal policy . Mr. Untermyer found that obligations due in June totaled $236,146 , - 000 . The city , he found , was prepared to redeem $14,600,000 in tax notes , $10,400,000 in revenue bonds and about $8,000,000 of revenue bills . The banks , he declared , besides their reported willingness to renew some $127,646,000 of revenue bills now in their hands , were , in his opinion , legally bound to extend $58,500,000 of outstanding corporate stock notes . The single obstacle in the way of meeting all obligations in June , the letter declared , was the $25,000,000 required to redeem outstanding certificates of indebtedness issued for unemployment and work - relief funds . These , the letter declared , the banks have refused to renew , Mr. Untermyer 's letter disclosed that relief requirements were running at the rate of about $8,000,000 a month , instead of the 0,000,000 upon which the city 's financing cal , culations were originally based . The city , he said , was entitled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would probably get a 20 per cent refund from the same source out of Federal funds soon to be distributed to the several States . Controller Berry indicated , after the executive meeting , that the upward turn in relief requirements had complicated the financial situation . The Board of Estimate now had , he said , " a new baby in their laps " because of the unexpectedly large requirements for relief work . Mr. Untermyer advised Controller Berry that adoption of the bridge toll and taxicab tax plans would provide the city with additional annual revenues of $17,000,000 , The bridge tolls , he estimated , would bring $7,0007000 and the taxicab tax . computed on the basis of 200,000,000 fares , about $10,000,000 . With this new revenue added to the State refund on relief expenditures , the city 's relief indebtedness should be met . Millions in Savings Required . " The immediate predicament of the city therefore , " Mr. Untermyer wrote , " arises out of and is due to the $25,000,000 item and to its inability to find the money for financing the monthly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ year the city encounters great difficulties and , taken all in all , it is evident that it can not avoid default unless it can reduce its budget requirements by drastic economies in the administration of its affairs to the extent of many millions per year , which could readily be accomplished without injustice and except for the purely political considerations involved . " The report held the attitude of the bankers and their reluctance to extend further large credits to the city " quite understandable " in view of the fact that the city " has long been derelict " in its financial policy . Basing his conclusion upon his study of Controller Berry 's estimate of revenues and requirements through next December , Mr. Untermyer took a gloomy view of the situation , even granting that the banks would renew all June maturities . The " ruinous " interest rates , he wrote , would force a default some time this year unless substantial savings and new revenues were found immediately . Adoption of the bridge toll and the five-cent fare on taxicab rides , Mr. Untermyer declared , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expenses , restore municipal credit . Its bonds , he predicted , could then be sold on a 4 per cent basis or less . Urges Appeal to People . " If the authorities continue unwilling to listen to you in the face of the approaching crisis . " Mr. Untermyer advised , " I hope you will not hesitate to make another direct appeal to the people , so that the responsibility for non-action will rest where it belongs . " Mayor O'Brien will send to numerous civic organizations invitations to attend the special meeting on Wednesday . Their views on the . bridge toll and taxicab proposals , he declared , will be asked for the guidance of the Board of Estimate . There was no indication , however , whether the meeting would be merely a general discussion or whether specific legislation would be considered . The unemployment relief problem , Mayor O'Brien said , was the real subject of the executive meeting yesterday . He would give no details , but said that he was confident that the city 's needs for June would be met . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the banks and representatives of charitable organizations had conferred on the general relief situation on Monday .
