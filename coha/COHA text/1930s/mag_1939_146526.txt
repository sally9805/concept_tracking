Back in January 1937 , few shrewd investors would have wasted a second look at bonds of the tiny Philippine Railway Co. , sick sugar-hauling road on the islands of Panay and Cebu . Selling around $11 , the $8,549,000 issue was about to mature , apparently a total loss to U. S. bondholders . Then came rumors that Washington might act , that the Philippine Commonwealth would redeem the issue at $65 . Bonds shot up to $31 in January and February as speculators bought for the rise , crashed when President Manuel Quezon denied his Government was buying them . Smelling a rigger , SEC investigated , found the flurry had cost speculators about $1,000,000 . <P> Convicted last week in Manhattan Federal Court for their part in this fruitless flurry were suave William P. Buckner Jr. , 32 ( bibulous distant relative of sermonizing New York Life Insurance Co . Chairman Thomas A. Buckner ) , and his associate William J. Gillespie , 37 . Unlike most U. S. Government prosecutions , handsome Bondster Buckner 's trial produced a flashy array of Government witnesses : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , brother and manager of Crooner Bing ( none of whom yielded to Buckner 's urgings to get rich quick in the Philippine bonds ) , Doris ( " Peewee " ) Donaldson and two other Broadway cuties . <P> Absent from the fortnight trial was Massachusetts ' Senator David Ignatius Walsh , who introduced a bill to help the bond redemption by Congress legislation . To lobby for the bill " Peewee " and her pals were flown to Washington for champagne parties . Said Buckner , " It never occurred to me that I had to become a monk . . . . " But for throwing away $12,500 of bondholders ' funds on the parties , as chairman of bondholders ' protective committee , as well as the bond rigging , Bondster Buckner and his friend Gillespie were convicted of mail fraud and conspiracy , may have to spend 37 years in jail . <P> One of the saddest men in the court room was little Felipe Abreu ( " Goodfellow Philip " ) Buencamino , 53 , whip of the Philippine Assembly , longtime confidant of President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ redemption plan for an alleged $50,000 , he was denounced by the Federal prosecutor as the " Judas of the Philippine Assembly . " Leaving last December to face the SEC inquiry , he told loyal followers : " I wish to break a little confidence which the Chief Executive ( Quezon ) has told me . ... He said he . . . did not believe me guilty of the accusations laid at my door . " Last week he was convicted of a part in the conspiracy , may be sentenced to two years in jail .
