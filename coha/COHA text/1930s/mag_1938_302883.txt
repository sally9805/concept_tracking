Having with unwonted consideration first told Congress that there was a Depression and that he meant to cure it , a few hours later last week , the President told the country . Result was his twelfth " fireside chat , " delivered from the diplomatic room of the <P> White House and punctuated by the ringing of a telephone bell in the police booth directly behind the President 's desk. * Because it was concerned almost entirely with fiscal matters , because these were expressed largely by quotations of his earlier message and because the President 's voice and manner were flatter , more perfunctory than usual , it was one of the dullest as well as the longest ( 4,860 words ) on record . Nonetheless , it was not devoid of appealing imagery , an adroitly conciliatory reference to Business and a thoughtful little essay on the ideology of centralized government . Excerpts : <P> Prince of Peace . " I had hoped to be able to defer this talk until next week because , as we all know , this is Holy Week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by speaking tonight there may be greater peace of mind and that the hope of Easter may be more real at firesides everywhere , and that it is not inappropriate to encourage peace when so many of us are thinking of the Prince of Peace . " <P> Dictatorships . " Democracy has disappeared in several other great nations-disappeared not because the people of those nations disliked democracy , but because they had grown tired of unemployment and insecurity , of seeing their children hungry while they sat helpless in the face of government confusion , government weakness , weakness through lack of leadership in government . Finally , in desperation , they chose to sacrifice liberty in the hope of getting something to eat . " <P> No Bad Names . " There is placed on all of us the duty of self-restraint . . . . That is the discipline of a democracy . Every patriotic citizen must say to himself or herself that immoderate statement , appeals to prejudice , the creation of unkindness , are offenses . . . against the whole population of the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am again expressing my hope that the Congress will enact at this session a wage-and-hour bill ... to insure a better distribution of our prosperity . . . . " <P> Profits . " It is essential in our economy that private funds must be put to work and all of us recognize that such funds are entitled to a fair profit . . . . <P> " I try not to forget that what really counts at the bottom of it all is that the men and women willing to work can have a decent job , a decent job to take care of themselves and their homes and their children adequately ; that the farmer , the factory worker , the storekeeper , the gas station man , the manufacturer , the merchant-big and small-the banker who takes pride in the help that he can give to the building of his community-that all these can be sure of a reasonable profit and safety for the earnings that they make-not today nor tomorrow alone , but as far ahead as they can see . " <P> Deep Water Sailor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we have charted . I propose to sail ahead . I feel sure that your hopes , I feel sure your help are with me . For , to reach a port , we must sail-sail , not lie at anchor ; sail , not drift . " <P>
