GEORGE C. MEN PRZSENTS OCEN132 FROM A BRA AWAYEC LEPS O NE time I wanted to tackle that kindly man , the late W. K. Vanderbilt , with a proposition , and the only way I could manage it was to sail on the same boat he was traveling on incognito . As he was sort of lonesome , he allowed me to become pretty well acquainted and we swapped yarns all the way across . One horse yarn of his has always stuck in my head  --  perhaps because it was so much like the dear theater . All the Vanderbilts know horses , of course  --  the old Commodore bred famous trotters , and after him the family went in for running horses . Well , some horse-breeding friend of Vanderbilt 's went broke and auctioned off his stable  --  this was over in France , where the Vanderbilt stables were moved to after Gates and Drake and the boys had put a crimp in things here with their heavy betting  --  and the Vanderbilt trainer was sent round to the sale to hid the prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trainer got stuck with a few scrubs that nobody would bid on . And presently he came round to Mr. Vanderbilt and mentioned , without quite believing it himself , that one of these scrubs was showing a dash of real speed . They looked up the beast 's pedigree , but he did n't have any pedigree at all  --  out of Nothing by Nobody . But that did n't make any difference to the colt . He kept kicking up his heels higher and higher , and finally ran the legs off every horse in France , including the cream of the Vanderbilt stables that for years had been bred for speed out of one of the finest studs in the world . Mr. Vanderbilt said that cured him of trying to make sense out of horses . Expecting the Unexpected  --  and Vice Versa N OW ' the trouble with me is that nothing has-ever succeeded yet in curing me of trying to make sense out of the theater . Time and again it has been made painfully plain that the unexpected is the only thing sure to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you expected the unexpected to happen , it just did n't . That 's getting a little complicated , I 'm afraid , but years of having sure things blow up under your nose , and seeing long chances come home , and then having the whole world go to bits under you puts you in a complicated frame of mind . Anyway , the next time you read of somebody laying down the law about . what secures success in the theater , tell him from me that success in the theater operates like success in roulette  --  when your number comes up , it conies up , and that 's about all . That 's what I know now  --  hut the knowledge still helps me not  --  and twenty years ago I was still talking about my experience and judgment with the best of them . Sometimes we got it in the neck and sometimes we sat back and said , " I told you so . " Take the history of the early Tarkington plays we did , for instance . Booth 's dramatization of The Gentleman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only me but the stage director and dear Clara Bloodgood and E. J. Morgan and Julia Dean of the cast  --  until we got it on the stage and found it would n't rehearse . We 'd been so mesmerized by Booth 's beautiful incidental descriptions that we had n't considered how the thing would play . That time the wheel spun against us . But then he and Harry Wilson wrote The Man From Home with David Warfield in mind and took it to Belasco , who was handling Warfield then . Belaseo could see nothing in it and said so out . loud . So they brought it to me , and I sent it to Nat Goodwin as a fat part for him . He turned it down flat  --  impossible . Obviously , somebody was wrong  --  I was sure it could n't he me  --  so I showed it to William Hodge , and he snapped at it and played it for us and  --  well , do I have to tell you again how many hundreds of thousands of dollars The Man From Home @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know their business as well as anybody in the theater . It was just our turn to guess right and theirs to guess wrong . Or else you 'd get something like the cat-andmouse agony that luck provided us when we took the Liberty Theater in New York for glorious Eleanor Robson . She was fresh from her tremendous international success in Merely Mary Ann and we had three sure-fire plays for her  --  well , anyway , they were written by Israel Zangwill and Jerome K. Jerome and Clyde Fitch , and they looked sure-fire . We put them on in succession . The first one died , the second one died , the third one died  --  and here we were with a lovely and brilliant . star and a big theater on our hands , and nothing to show for it but losses . That was when Paul Armstrong rolled up his sleeves and took just one week to write Salomy Jane for us around the Bret Harte character . He did a magnificent job  --  he always did when he was in a big hurry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week to do us Alias Jimmy Valentine . As rehearsals progressed , Salomy looked better and better , and it went like wildfire on the opening night . The only possible hitch was Armstrong himself . He had an innocent passion for curtain speeches and he had been relaxing on champagne . I gave orders to keep him off the stage with fixed bayonets if necessary , but he dodged past the sentries at the close of the third act and , just when I was congratulating myself on the way things had turned out , here he was in front of the curtain , primed to the gills with champagne and speechifying . The worst happened . He told that audience in detail just how hard he 'd worked and just what a fine play it was and just how proud he was of it , and so on and so forth for what seemed like hours . Shakspere could n't have got away with that speech after the opening of Hamlet . People began to snicker  --  and a first-nighthr 's snicker is a sinister thing  --  and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and there . But the providence that looks after people in Armstrong 's condition gave him a hunch just in time . He straightened up and struck a sort of a Daniel Webster pose and said : " And , ladies and gentlemen , I owe it all  --  every bit of it  --  to the great soul of Bret Harte ! " That fetched them  --  you could hear the applause over in Jersey  --  and Salomy Jane was doubly made . Sober or otherwise , Armstrong could n't have figured out a better climax on purpose . Pinning a Happy Ending on Tragedy B ESIDES making curtain speeches , Arm- st trong 's other inconvenient habit was gett ing insulted and not speaking to you . When we had him and Rex Beach collaborating on Going Some , lie and Beach were n't on speaking terms , and by the time they got through cutting the other fellow 's lines and insisting on their own , there was just a scenario left  --  no play at all . Some time later , when lie and Wilson Mizner did The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't speaking to . That time he had to wait for his curtain speech till I gave him the nod . I was n't in any hurry , of course . The applause kept going and the curtain kept . rising and falling and Armstrong kept looking at me like a hungry dog , just ready to burst with suppressed oratory . Finally I nodded , just before the applause died down , and he went down the aisle like a three-alarm fire . But he 'd waited so long and got so nervous lie could n't utter a word when he got there  --  just stood and gulped . Out in the lobby afterward somebody asked George Cohan ; " Why on earth did n't Paul make his speech tonight ? " and Cohan answered : " Did n't you know ? He 's not on speaking terms with the audience ! " Incredible how small things can make all the difference to a play . Parker 's delightful Pomander Walk was a dull failure till he got the effect of the slamming doors into it  --  the six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in the face of the rich girl who comes to the Walk looking for the sailor hero . Adding just one exchange of lines to the end of the third act in Disraeli made a five-year success out of what bad been just storehouse filler . And now and again you had to mess up a fine play to get it across . That was what happened to The Fourth Estate , a grand newspaper play by J. M. Patterson and Harriet Ford . Its tremendous tragic climax was gripping all right  --  too gripping for the customers  --  it just paralyzed them , and after while nobody came to be gripped . So we swallowed our medicine and the authors wrote in a sloppy finish that gave the girl to the hero and pardoned her blackguard father and all the other pretty touches the audience seemed to want , and , by gosh , it was a big winner from then on . That was one time when I 'd probably have been more comfortable with a failure . Failure was certainly what we deserved after changing it in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 'd have thought that ten or a dozen productions a year would have kept us happy without . our asking for trouble that nobody else would touch . But then we fell over the New Theater , a huge and magnificently equipped place which had been hoodooed from the time it was planned simply because its sponsors , with the best intentions in the world , had dedicated it to the artistically minded . When we took it over it was the white elephant of New York , absolutely impossible as a. business proposition . Broadway immediately concluded  --  and I will admit the evidence was all on their side  --  that success had softened our brains . Maybe it had , but all the same we rode that white elephant with the native grace of the King of Siam himself . Eventually we proved to he the only people who ever made money out of the place  --  they finally tore it down a couple of years ago  --  and believe me. we enjoyed every hour of our tenancy . We had n't dreamed of wishing the thing on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for a couple of weeks , since it was the only theater fine enough and big enough to hold our Mascagni opera . Since that was to he the grandest splash in Liebler &; Co. ' s history , we had to have the grandest theater in town for it . My original notion had been to sow the publicity whirlwind by producing the first grand opera by a foreign composer ever to have its world premiere in America , basing it on the popularity of the Italian folk songs that the tourists always went mad over in Naples , 0 Sole Mio and Torna a Surriento and Santa Lucia and the rest of them . Louis N. Parker had already done us a magnificent scenario for it , to be called Bella Napoli , and I proposed to persuade Mascagni to do the music . I 'd known him ever since he 'd done the incidental music for The Eternal City . But when I went to see him about it , he started playing me themes out of another opera he was then working on , called Ysobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put Bella Napoli away in moth balls for the time being . Very magnetic , Mascagni . And , I thought , a very fine opera , this Ysobelbased on the Lady Godiva story , in ease you want to know . Castle In the Air HIS time the sky was to be 1 the limit . We worked on the preparations for Ysobel a solid year before it saw rehearsal , and sank into it every cent we could get . It cost us a mere forty-five thousand dollars in advance to get the consent of both Mascagni and his publishers . He was to come over and direct the final rehearsals and conduct the orchestra throughout the grand tour we planned after New York . In Paris I signed up Bessie Abbott , the beautiful coloratura , for the lead , and we selected a fine supporting company in Italy . Then we started greasing the ways to launch the thing in Barnum style in New York . I was always a press agent at heart , I guess , and before we were through . Mascagni and Ysobel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why . Everything was arranged but having the Statue of Liberty drop Mascagni a curtsy as he came up the bay . It . took a good six months to manage the big testimonial dinner in his honor , juggling dates to get the people we wanted  --  they were n't people , they were personages  --  just Theodore Roosevelt and William Dean Howells and Woodrow Wilson and Thomas A. Edison and Nicholas Murray Butler and Walter Damrosah and Booth Tarkington and a hundred others nearly as big  --  the distilled essence of Who 's Who . The entertainment at the dinner was incidentally to include songs by one Enrico Caruso . We chartered three excursion steamers to take fifteen thousand loyal Italians down the bay under Henry Clews ' chaperonage to meet Mascagni 's boat and wave flags and sing . We arranged an official reception at City Hall  --  keys of the city from Mayor Gaynor 's own hands  --  which meant something in those days , before official welcomes were New York 's chief industry . Then the great man was to drive through the Little Italy section @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheering and such . That part was all fixed up with the assistance of certain apparently obscure Italians who had a lot of mysterious influence among their compatriots , too much to get inquisitive about . I 'd turned over the opening-night gallery of the New Theater to one of them , the most influential apparently , which seemed to be a considerable favor to him  --  he sold the seats at about ten dollars a whack to other Italians , who appeared uncannily willing to pay that much . Dame Nellie Melba was going to write a review of Ysobel which three hundred newspapers had agreed to run the morning after the opening . The whole thing was laid out like a train of powder  --  it only needed Maseagni to set i t off . So I sent Ralph Edmunds , a veteran grand-opera press agent , galloping off to collect Maseagni , pay him . the last insignificant ten thousand dollars and put him on board the Kaiser . Wilhelm II , the last boat that got to New York in time . He kept us posted by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he paid him the money , when they were to meet at Cherbourg to board the boat . And then , on the morning they were to sail , here was an odd cable from Edmunds  --  he was sailing alone ; Maseagni had not turned up . The only explanation was another cable a day or so later from the great man  --  it had n't been quite convenient for him to sail , but he 'd catch the next boat. , with his most cordial regards . " Do n't bother " was the substance of what I wired hack . There was nothing to sail for . The dinner wria sunk , the reception was sunk , the advance sale was sunkYsobel died then and there as far as we were concerned . That little vagary cost us one hundred and twenty-five thousand dollars all told , and we were completely cleaned out . The only way we ever got going again was through Klaw &; Erlanger , always our best friends , who let us have one hundred thousand dollars to see us through to the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , MASCAGNI was n't crazy . He was a prewar Italian and just had n't got the idea . In his world  --  before Mussolini  --  a star or director who felt a little lazy just called off the show and the public took it like lambs . He never could have been made to understand the waste in money and effort of postponing the opening a few days . I have never talked with the Maestro since . Our only contact afterward came when his publisher sued me for the five thousand dollars that , was still due on our agreement , which , I am pleased to say , they did not get . But it . wasn't. taken so calmly by my mysterious Italian friend , who 'd planned to make so much money out of the gallery ( Continued from Pogo 67 ) But for a moment he could find no word to say at all . He muttered incredulously , " Eh ? " And Bess cried : " Do n't stand there like a goof , with yore mouth open ! I guess you heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but they still stick to it . " " But , ma " Jeff protested . " Do n't you ' ma ' me , " Mrs. Atlebery cried , her cheeks bright . " What 's the matter with us gitting married , if we 're a mind ? " " A-plenty , ma , " he urged . " Yo 're old enough to know better , the both of you . " " An old fool 's no worse than a young fool , " she retorted . " And far as that goes , it ai n't so foolish as it sounds . Land knows , Will had ought to have someone to stand up to him . He 's rode Bess ragged long enough . I 'll bring him up with his toes a-digging . He wo n't make a fool out of me !

" Better not let me see ' em laughing , " her father assured her , " or I 'll make ' em laugh the wrong side of their mouth . " And Mrs. Atlebery exclaimed : " There ai n't a mite of use your talking . It 's all settled . I telephoned the minister and the town clerk and all . They 're coming out here , and it 'll be over and done with , an hour from now , so you can make the most of it . " " I wo n't let you ! " Bess cried , and the older woman said sharply : " You ca n't help ! " seats . Of course he had to pay it all back to his henchmen , and that seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrecked our office . " Why you no tell me he no sail ? " he said . " You tell me , Mr. Tyler , and we make him sail . " I explained that it would n't have done any good  --  I had n't known in time to apply any pressure of my own  --  but I was greatly impressed by the somewhat sinister confidence this fellow had in his ability to make Maseagni or any other Italian jump through hoops . I knew better than to ask for any explanations , but the next time I wanted a miracle accomplished over Italy-way , I remembered that I knew somebody who apparently knew how to go about it . We 'll get back to that presently . Well , score one for the white elephant and a goose egg for us . But . it was n't long before we were back in the New Theater again for another two weeks , this time for a tremendous production of Maeterlinek 's Mary Magdalene for Olga Nethersole . To keep the audience in their seats between acts , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russian Symphony Orchestra of one hundred pieces  --  a grand orchestra and magnificent old Jewish music specially arranged for the occasion . It was n't Ysobel and Mascagni , but it was pretty big all the same . And Bess turned , half weeping , to Jeff . " Jeff , make them stop it , " she pleaded . " Do n't let them go and make theirselves a laughingstock . " So she was in his arms . Jeff held her close , staring over her shoulders at old Will Corrie and his mother standing there defiantly , and his senses were bemused . He looked at Will helplessly , and then at his mother . " But , ma , " he urged miserably , " I ca n't see what 's got into you . You always did hate his insides , till you could n't find a name hard enough to call him . " " He 's all I ever said , and more too , " she agreed thoughtfully . " I du n no but that 's the reason . A man as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kind of satisfaction to make him toe the murk . It 'll give me something to occupy my mind . " " You 'll kill each other , " he predicted . She tossed her head . " I du n no as it ai n't more sensible to git yore quarreling done before you 're married , " she retorted , " ' stead of mooning around like a hungry calf all the time . " Bess sobbed in Jeff 's arms ; and Mrs. Atlebery said stoutly : " You go on and take her out of here , if she 's bound to snivel ! I do n't aim to have anybody crying at my wedding ! " And Bess at that turned on the older woman with an anger to match her own . " I 'm a-going , " she promised . " I would n't stay to see ! " She crossed to her father . " Nor I ai n't coming back , pa ! " she said vigorously . " You can he as big a fool as you 're a mind , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently drove away down the road together , and the moon shone on the snow . Half a mile below the house they met another sleigh . This was the minister responding to Mrs. Atlebery 's summons ; and he recognized them and would have spoken . ( Continued from Page 19 ) Everything was grand at the dress rehearsal , and the first act went beautifully the night we opened . The orchestra did itself so proud in the intermission that nobody dreamed of leaving his seat . Everything was running off like clockwork and I leaned back and thought the New Theater was n't such a bad place after all . The curtain was supposed to rise as the orchestra finished its intermezzo . The orchestra finished , but the curtain stayed ominously down  --  a blank , awful stage wait of the worst variety . I went scrambling backstage , blue in the face  --  and here was Miss Nethersole lounging in her dressing room , still in her first-act costume , having a cigarette and taking it as easy as an NRA hired man . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ orchestra really finished ? I had no idea . " And that little piece of regardlessness killed Mary Magdalene for all of us . By the time she got changed and on stage , our whole effect was ruined . We played out the two weeks , but we might just as well have dismissed the company that night . Score two for the white elephant and another goose egg for us . I know it was crazy , but to tell you the truth , these two experiences had given me a strange sort of hankering after that beautiful place , badly as it had treated us . There was something about this huge building , all now and gorgeous , with a tremendous But Bess caught up the whip and lashed Jeff 's horse into a headlong run , leaving the minister astonished far behind . " And then , " Jeff concluded , " she began to cry on my shoulder , and she cried awful . " He chuckled mirthfully . " And the funny thing about it , we was almost home before it struck either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hinder us from marrying , any time we had a mind ! " He was silent , and by his tone seemed to have finished . " And did the old folks really get married ? " I asked . " Oh , certain , " he said . " Ma , when she 's set on doing a thing , there 's no stopping her . " And he said : " They still fight and row and jaw , just the same as always . But they like it , I guess . Ma looks better than she ever did , and the old man too . " And he confessed : " Bess , she vowed she 'd never speak to either one of them again . It was close to a year before she come around to it ! " He rose , and stretched his arms above his head and yawned . " But all 's straight now , " he told me , and he urged : " You come along up to the house and let Bess cook supper for us . She 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there ? " I asked cautiously . " No , no , they live over at the Corrie place . Bess and me , this is ours here . " There was deep contentment in his tones . The shadows of the elms were lengthening across the meadow as we went up the hill . I followed on his heels , or walked beside him when the way was wide : but we moved for the most . part silently , Only when we reached his own barnyard , Jeff said thoughtfully : " And I du n no to this day but what ma just done it so Bess and me could marry . I would n't put it past . her anyways. " stage and all the latest wrinkles in stage equipment and lighting , that made my fingers itch . Its reputation made it a challenge , and I could n't help taking the challenge personally . After all , if we were as good as we thought we were , why couldn't. we use it for thundering spectacular things and make a go of it ? The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " but we did it anyway . There was a lot of method in our madness , though , a considerable dash of sanity for flavoring . Robert Hichens , collaborating with Mary Anderson , was writing a spectacle play out of his novel , The Garden of Allah , for us , and I 'd already spent some time in Algeria , the setting of the book , getting excited over the really fancy possibilities the place offered for the stage . After we leased the New Theater , to the accompaniment of a great shaking of heads  --  we renamed it the Century , by the way  --  I transported Edward Morange , the set designer , and Hugh Ford , the stage director , and the author and myself to Biskra , the Algerian desert town in the play , which had hitherto been untouched by the tourist trade . There wo went into the atmosphere thing as thoroughly as if we 'd been going to turn Mohammedan . This production was going to be right . For weeks we stayed there , driving out into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the desert sky and the ungodly quiet and the yapping of the nomad dogs , and the rest of the time we studied Biskra itself  --  Arab dance halls , costumes , architecture , everything clear down to the smells , which were a study in themselves . We even had the heavens charted for us as they appeared at Biskra. so that our artificial stars would he exactly like reality . And then came the long-drawn agony of staging it . Trouble in The Garden of Allah The casting was a problem . It was a considerable job to begin with to catch and import seventy-five real Arabs , with dancers and camels to match , for general background . Then for the hero role  --  a renegade priest  --  we secured Lewis Waller , the most . magnificent type of English romantic actor , who 'd never been in America  --  that cost a mere thousand a week for him and another thousand for his managers . Mary Mannering was the best available person for the heroine  --  but she 'd already retired from the stage and was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to he . She thought she could train it off in time , but it turned out to be impossible , and we had to depend on the tightest kind of corsets . We had to have a thundering fine actor for the third big rOle , and the worst of that was that Eben Plympton , the most temperamental person in the world , was obviously the only one for the job . We 'd had several experiences with him and knew he meant trouble from the word " go . " But we knuckled under to our better  --  or worse  --  judgment , and sent for him . In he walked like the whole House of Lords at once : " Why do you send for me , Mr. Tyler ? " " I have a part I think you 'd like to play . " " Again the court of last resort , I pre-sume ? " " Absolutely , " said I. " If there was anybody else on earth who could play it as well , I would n't have sent for you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I must admit that this time we had no rouble out of him whatsoever . And the ordeal of rehearsing The Garden of Allah was enough to fetch temperament out of a granite statue . During the last week of rehearsals neither Ford nor Fred Stanhope , his assistant , nor I ever left the theater except to snatch ham and eggs at a quick lunch across the street . If Ford had n't been the finest director alive , the thing would never have seen daylight . We slept on sofas in the lounge when we slept at all , we freshened up now and then in a shower bath there was in the theater , and we worked the stage crew and the east till they nearly dropped in their tracks . There were a lot of huge technical effects that had to be right and refused to come right at any price . Along toward the end of the battle Ford walked into the office carrying Gebhardt , the property man , who 'd been working on the sandstorm for three solid days without sleep . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twisted up , eyes half shut , twitching all over like a man with palsy  --  and I 'm blessed if I did n't begin to cry . They took him away to a Turkish bath and gave him a couple of hours ' sleep , and then he was back on the sandstorm again . That sandstorm could n't , have done us any more damage if it had been a real one . We never would have got it set if somebody February 24. 5924 had n't suggested the use of farina , the breakfast-food stuff , tons of it , for sand  --  nothing else would hang in the air the right way , so the wind machines could make it look like the real thing . And even then we did n't get . it under control for a week . Every time we used it the first three or four rows were always an inch deep in farina . Golly , that was a big production any way you take it . There were one hundred and fifty men , stage hands and forty-five electricians included @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a young army that the audience never saw . In the money way it took exactly every cent I had in the world and some thousands belonging to other people before it opened . On the other side , the advance sale of seats for the Saturday-night opening  --  the beginning of a regular 52.50 price  --  was so heavy that we advanced the opening to the matinee and sold that out , too , in about twenty-four hours . The press was giving us as many columns as if The Garden of Allah had been the world series . The famous Mary Anderson , who was heart and soul in the thing  --  she even offered to play the lead for us temporarily when the leading lady 's weight problem had us stuck , but we could n't afford that  --  after she 'd played the rOle a few weeks , no other actress would dare touch it  --  arrived from England at just the right time to give us overwhelmingly more publicity . The stage hands had n't slept for forty-eight hours prior to the opening . Any drowsiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars to divide among themselves if they 'd all stay awake during the matinee . They stayed awake all right and got their money , but it was two months before they 'd finished quarreling over how to split it up . And on the following Monday they struck and walked out on us , protesting against too much work . We had to appeal to their unions , which forced them hack on the job , or the show would have had to close . The First  --  Night Jury There was a line big bar downstairs in the Century . That was what I relied on to keep me alive during the opening performance . When the curtain went . up before an amazing audience of what was commonly known as our best people , I was propped up against the center box of the dress circle , clear in the rear of the house , hanging on to myself like a man going to be shot . livery cent I owned or could borrow was in the thing .

If that blessed sandstorm smothered too many people in the front rows with farina  --  and Diamond Jim Brady was sitting right in the middle of the first row , in spite of my warnings  --  we were ruined a third time . The first two acts would n't prove so much  --  mostly spectacular stuff  --  but if the great second-act climax did n't go over  --  well , every time I got to that point I ducked out and went downstairs and had another shot of Scotch , I must have had ten or twelve of them ( luring those two acts and they bad no more effect on me than so much water .

Then the applause broke from the front row to the gallery and I knew we were in . Five minutes after I heard that roar of applause I was as drunk as sixteen fiddlers . All my whiskies hit me at once like a load of brick , and there are only two things more I can remember about that afternoon . One was Jim Brady booming out his enthusiasm as he plowed his way out into the lobby , just a mass of fat and farina , and the other was Norman Hapgood coming up the aisle and yelling at me over the racket : " Hey , George , lend me fifty thousand dollars ? " After that somebody took me upstairs and laid me down in the office to sleep it off . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the first time in its lordly existence , and the whole dear theatrical world was saying it had always been obvious that somebody would make the New Theater profitable some day . It was cheerily evident that sometimes it paid big to be an idiot and rush in where no self-respeating angel , theatrical or otherwise , would dream of setting foot . And now that we had this magnificent overgrown barn on our hands  --  if the luck only kept running  --  there was no telling what we might do with it . The architects had started with the idea of a small theater on the roof of the place , without really carrying it out  --  so a Children 's Theater up topside was our next attack of ambition while The Garden of Allah was packing them in downstairs . It was to sell that idea to Mr. Vanderbilt , who was the New Theater 's heaviest backer , that . I sailed with him that time on the Mauretania . He was uncommonly easy to sell , because of the educational possibilities of the thing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said thirty-five thousand dollars  --  he said all right  --  and then we talked horses the rest of the five days . The Children 's Theater The first performance of this Children 's Theater was a tremendous occasion , under the usual best possible auspices , attended by Morgans and Vanderbilts and crack educators and such , droves of them . The invitation we sent to John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , produced a note from his secretary saying that Mr. Rockefeller did n't care to invest in theatrical enterprises  --  he seems to have changed his mind since then all right . It amused me to be able to write back that , if the secretary would take the trouble to read the letter , he 'd see it was n't an appeal for funds , but an invitation to occupy is box , gratis . We opened with a grand bill , including Frances Hodgson Burnett 's Rackety-Packety House and the new color moving pictures , and all the grown-ups had a swell time and the press raved over us , but very few children came after the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of being bored to take them , and when they sent nursemaids , the nursemaids objected and reported it was terrible . It was on that Vanderbilt trip to England that finally , after ten years of consistent failure , I met Rudyard Kipling , who had almost become a symbol of the unattainable in my life . Bernhardt , Duse , Mane , Sardou , Barrie , Shaw were eventually got at , whether or not I carried my point with them , but Mr. Kipling had steadily refused to see me. and his agent had always stalled me with bland denials that anything theatrical could be arranged . The best I 'd ever got was a third-hand suggestion that , in his opinion , somebody might he able to get a play out of The Brushwood Boy , which was cold comfort . I experienced real old-fashioned buck ague when my racing driver drove me up to his place in Sussex in my brand-new , sixty-horsepower , battleship-gray car . Meeting Rudyard Kipling was probably the only thing on earth that could have knocked the Century Theater out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was opened by a smallish , mild man with a largish mustache . I 'd expected something imposing in the way of butlers  --  I certainly had n't expected Mr. Kipling himself to act as porter . He said : " Hello , " and I stammered out : " How do you do ? " having gone up in my lines completely , and before I 'd got my mental feet snider me again he 'd marched me inside and sat me down on the lawn , rolled over on the grass and started talking . I got back my composure pretty quickly under these circumstances and tackled him with the bright ideas that had been simmering in my head ever since Boer War times . Did n't he have in his head art unwritten Soldiers Three story ? Why , yes , he had  --  the death of Mulvaney . Good Lord , Mulvaney 's death was poison , of course  --  so I dropped it like a hot potato and threw another one at him . Why not take the Soldiers Three and all the rest of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Colonel 's lady and Dinah Shadd  --  nearly everybody but the animals in The Jungle Book  --  and make a composite Kipling play out of them against the mysterious East background of Kim that he knew so well ? That interested him . Well , I was just in glory . here was the unapproachable Kipling excitedly laying out plans that I 'd suggested over an excellent lunch  --  everything as comfortable and propitious as heart could wish . Unhappily , very little came of it . The vollaborator he wanted insisted on half the royalties , when he should have got down on his knees and thanked heavers for 10 per cent  --  Mr. Kipling 's agent had offered 40 ? and then , when Mr. Kipling determined to try going it alone , he never could satisfy himself as a dramatist . Finally I had to abandon the idea along with the Raffles-Sherlock Holmes scheme as something obviously too good ever to come true . But I had met and known quite well Mr. Rudyard Kipling . Our second big splash at the Century was already taking shape  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Loti , the , great French poet and novelist , and Judith Gasifier , Theophile Gautier 's daughter . On my way to talk things over with Loti , I ran into the first visit of the Russian Ballet to Paris  --  sending that gorgeous organization to Paris just when the Czar wanted a big French loan was one of the finest publicity stunts in history  --  and was immediately smitten by the ambition to outdo the Russians ' amazing costuming with The Daughter of Heaven in New York . We got something gorgeous out of it , all right , and Viola Allen played the lead for us , which was always a pleasure , but , although it lasted out the season in New York and on the road , The Daughter of Heaven ended up with losses . In spite of the fact that our costuming had really outdone the Russians , and that our scenery by Morange was amazingly beautiful , neither press nor public paid much attention . There was plenty of fun and games in it though . We had Loti come over to America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he arrived . Frank Ward O'Malley , the most famous reporter of his time if Dick Davis had n't been around , turned up at . the press session looking for one of his special stories . Lot-i 's personal appearance , which did have some queerish touches . seemed to tickle O'Malley immensely , and he amused himself throughout the interview by cracking wise about . the great man 's looks while the interpreter was laboriously translating the questions and answers . It was hard for all of us to keep our faces straight . The blow-off came during rehearsal a couple of weeks later when Loti 's interpreter got into translation troubles . Getting tired of it , Loti opened up and told me , in better English than most college professors speak , just what he was trying to get at  --  a long , complicated speech , perfectly enunciated and full twenty minutes in duration . To this day I do n't know what he said . I could do nothing but gape at him and think back to what O'Malley had said about him to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impassive as a wooden Indian . A Made.to  --  Order Prince Then , when we sent The Daughter of Heaven on tour , we picked up a stray Korean somewhere whose principal asset was his immense good looks , dressed him in lavish Oriental robes and sent him out ahead of the production as Exhibit A  --  Prince Such-andSuch from the Celestial Empire  --  with young Heywood Broun to lecture on the civilization of the Orient . while the prince sat on the platform and made the ladies ' hearts miss a beat . That was all he had to do , and I must say he did it very well  --  too well . It was grand publicity , but he got such tremendous attention from the press that we were going to have the Chinese Embassy on our necks in no time , that was plain . So we decided to fire him and call the lecture tour off . But the prince would n't be fired . He was having a grand time  --  the best hotels , the best food , tea in somebody 's drawing-room every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention lavished on him by every silly woman that saw him . It had gone to his head till I swear I think he really believed he was a prince . It took a lot of money and a lot of vigorous language to snap him out of his dreams and chase him away . There were the makings of a first-class impostor in that slant-eyed kid . After that we used the Century to put on Louis N. Parker 's Joseph and His Brethren , which redeemed a good deal of the losses on the Loti play . Ancient Egypt in the time of the Hebrews lent itself admirably to our kind of spectacle and we darn near had another Garden of Allah on our hands . Not quite though . Thanks to our staff , The Garden of Allah was the biggest thing in dramatic spectacles the American theater had ever seen  --  not that anybody remembers it nowadays . Why , when they tore the Century down , a New York newspaper mentioned that the most successful production that ever played there was a comic opera called The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fashion of plays with Eastern settings  --  Kismet and Chu Chin Chow and Omar the Tent-Maker , and so forth . Anything 4 Eastern was all the same to the public . They did n't know  --  they do n't yet. , for that matter  --  there was any difference between Morocco and Turkestan , and cared less . A Transplanted Garden of Allah Just like the movie magnate that came to see me in London after the great success of The Garden of Allah . You 'd know his name if I mentioned it . " Mr. Tyler , " he says , " ye vant to buy The Garden of Allah . " Not for sale . " But ve 'll pay a lot of money for it ! " Not for sale . " But veil go to Egypt to make the production ! " " Why go to Egypt ? " I asked . " Veil , is n't it laid in Egypt ? " " No , " I said , " it is n't . " " Vell , " he says , " verever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " I suppose he 's still trying to figure out why neither that nor the money would tempt me to part with a play that in many ways was the high point of my extremely dizzy career . I think a lot of the affeetion I felt for Joseph and His Brethren was due to the fact that we 'd persuaded glorious old James O'Neill to play , Jacob for us . That was a queer feeling  --  and not altogether joyful either  --  my first respectable job had been working for him , and now , when he 'd practically retired , I was asking him to play for me in a huge production in the biggest theater in New York . I went , in to see his scenes practically every night during the long run of the play , because his voice  --  he had the finest voice in the world  --  had ' never ceased to fascinate me . He had insisted on doubling in Pharaoh as well as playing Jacob , because , he said , he 'd be hanged if he 'd wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in which Jacob made his only appearances . His memory was n't all it . had been , but you 'd never have known from out front that the courtiers round Pharaoh 's throne were feeding him his lines from beginning to end . He was a king in every sense of the word throughout , and a king in real life as well . The last rule he ever played was for us  --  the blind fiddler in Brandon Tynan 's The Melody of Youth  --  the same play that marked Eva Le Gallienne 's American stage debut  --  and he asked to do that as a favor to me . James O'Neill and that movie producer seem to have got stuck down together here . The movie man was just beginning and O'Neill was just finishing  --  and there 's the contrast for you between the theater as I knew it and what passes for the equivalent today . I could n't make it any sharper if I tried . And then , just when we 'd confirmed our luck , providence came along and took the Century @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of what might have happened if The Daughter of Heaven had lost some more and Joseph and His Brethren had n't been a success , had been giving me some uncomfortable moments . Each new production at . the Century would call for every cent we could raise , and a single disaster would  --  well , it was obvious that , if we were going on with it , we needed heavy backing , for safety 's sake . So I suggested to the owners that they might back me in producing spectacle and we could tie Up with the Philadelphia and Boston opera houses and the Chicago Auditorium , the only houses on the road her chances . That absurd war was already starting up in Europe , but , since we were n't in it. , that was no skin off our noses . We paid slight attention to news from Europe because we were head over ears in readying The Garden of Paradise . It was aimed right down the same alley as the Century productions . We did n't have the Century any more , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big , not so expensive , and better located , and we were unhappy without . something tremendous to sink our teeth in . Edward Sheldon , the extremely successful author of Salvation Nell and Romance and The Nigger , had written The Garden of Paradise for Emily Stevens round Hans Christian Andersen 's story The Little Mermaid . It was to boil over with trick lighting effects and underwater mermaids on wires  --  nothing circus , though  --  we 'd looked after the artistic end of it by getting Joseph Urban to do the sets . His work at . the Boston Opera House , the first he did in America , was attracting attention , and after one look at his work on Monna Vanua I secured him for us . He was obviously the only man on earth who could capture the spirit that Sheldon had written into the thing . Getting Urban Across It was Urban who first brought the war home to us . He was in Austria when it began , planning to return when things were set in New York . But when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to get himself , his wife and his three children smuggled out of Austria into some little Italian border town  --  Italy was n't in the war yet  --  and cable for help  --  no money and , what was much worse , no chance of getting on a boat . The Americans were all leaving Europe like rats , the boats were all packed to the rails already , and even one person , let alone five , could n't get accommodations . Of course we could n't any more get along without Urban than we could without the script . So I cabled my old friend , Salvatore Cortesi , the head of the Associated Press in Italy , and rested easy . Cortesi could fix it . He was very close to royalty and the Pope and everybody else important and would immediately get the government to take steps . Back came a cable from Cortesi admitting helplessly that he had tried everything and the best he could do for my Herr Urban was to get him as far south as Naples . Incredible , but true . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  and I was desperate . At that point I bethought myself in a sudden inspiration of my strangely mysterious Italian from the East Side who had been so confident about making the great Mascagni sail . He was still confident  --  so much so that I thought he was crazy too . They would n't take cables in Italian , so I saw the message he sent when it was translated into French : it went to some obscure Italian in Naples : J. URBAN RIFE AND THREE CHILDREN AT HOTEL BRISTOL NAPLES STOP PUT THEM ON FIRST BOAT AND GIVE THEM 200 DOLLARS IN GOLD . That was just midsummer madness . Gold was as scarce in Europe then as it is now here . But the amazing answer came back : J. URBAN WIFE AND THREE CHILDREN SAILING ON SAN GUILIELMO STOP HAVE GIVEN HIM 200 DOLLARS IN COLD . Can you tie that ? This little fellow from the depths of Little Italy had put something across that no legitimate authority could accomplish . Once again I carefully refrained from asking questions . Well , Urban arrived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Paradise hum . We were playing with fire again and as happy as kids in a sand pile . Dear Ned Sheldon wanted an invited audience of big bugs and friends for the dress rehearsal . That did n't listen well to me  --  there 's nothing riskier than giving your friends a chance to be critics  --  but he was too sweet and simple to realize it , so we gave in . Of course the worst happened . Our under-water scenes were ungodly complicated and the dress rehearsal was full of hitches and our invited audience went away grumbling . I 'd tried to make the best of it by leaving the curtain up during intermissions , figuring that seeing the stage crew at work might excuse us and amuse them . But , being friends of ours , they could n't be jollied into making allowances , and we had to open the first night under the tremendous handicap of their widely expressed bad opinion . Things went smooth as silk the opening night and the scenery was a memorable triumph for Urban  --  the late Ziegfeld @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but The Garden of Paradise was an unmatchable masterpiece  --  but the scenery and the technical effects overwhelmed the play . A simpler production would have allowed Sheldon 's delightful script to make its own way . As it was , with the added handicap of advance damnation , The Garden of Paradise died on our hands . We 'd just outsmarted ourselves , that was all . A Fine Time to Go Broke All right , we said , better luck next time  --  we 'd just break out in a fresh place . Then we woke up and discovered that that was just what we could n't do . Three months beforehand , six months afterward , we could easily have persuaded the banks to tide us over  --  we 'd always been good for what we needed . But just then there was n't a red cent in the world that somebody had n't nailed down and was now standing over with a shotgun . You could n't have raised a thousand dollars on the Woolworth Building . Not only the banks but the whole world had crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to arrive , they came out again , but in the meantime Liebler &; Co. just fell apart . We 'd certainly picked a fine time to produce a lavishly expensive failure that took our last cent . It was crazy  --  loony  --  impossiblebut there it was . Ordinarily we might have got by on the profits from the road , which was full of money-making plays of ours  --  Pomander Walk and The Deep Purple and Disraeli and Green Stockings and The Dawn of a Tomorrow  --  and Pygmalion was doing mighty well in New York  --  but throughout the country the war excitement had stopped people going to the theater and there were no profits . There we sat , our laps full of potential money , unable to raise the price of a smoke . For fifteen years we 'd forgot . ten about the sheriff , but now he came right in and put his feet on the desk . All we could do was see lie was comfortable and exit , closing the door softly behind us . Fifteen years of frantic activity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing . And the curtain came down . The only applause was Shaw 's  --  he cabled from London : YOU 'RE NOW MORE ELIGIBLE THAN EVER TO PRODUCE MY PLAYS . It was a facer all right , one of those things that take a long time to make sense at all . For several days  --  well , maybe it was longer than that ; I 'm pretty hazy in my mind about it  --  I was every bit as dazed as I was when The Christian first started us on our road to glory . For weeks I did n't go near the theatrical district . But I could n't stay home either  --  that would . have driven me crazy  --  so every morning I got up early and took my hat and my dog and walked as far as I could in the opposite direction , twenty , thirty miles a day , clear out to Nyack sometimes . I was sort of numb , I guess , just paralyzed from the neck up by this sudden sense of being down and out . But the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . After while it began to settle me into something like sanity again , and pretty soon , by fits and starts , I began to feel that this accidental cleaning off of the slate was a sort of a relief . You see , although I had n't realized it till after we hit the rocks , our fifteen years of glory had begun to get a little monotonous . Was n't it Stevenson that said to travel hopefully was a better thing than to arrive ? The game was always fundamentally the same and the stakes had got so high they did n't mean much any more . That gave me something to think about while I tramped through Yonkers and points north , and something to think about was what I 'd been needing the worst way . The business of where did I go from there , how to start again , began to look like sport . Then one day I had a letter from Mr. Erlanger asking me to come down and see him . Down I went , and very queer Broadway did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said . " Well , what are you going to do now ? " I said I was n't very clear on that yet , which was gospel truth . " H 'm , " he says , " we loaned you some money once , did n't we ? Loan it to you again if you want . " I sort of grunted . " Or else , " he says , " we 'll put up the money and you put on the plays , and we 'll see what happens . " So I took a deep breath and said yes . I 'd aged twenty years in those few weeks , but now the whole twenty peeled off like a glove and twenty more came with them . This prospect of having some fun again in the old way , building a whole career up from scratch , practically turned me into a kid again overnight . We had our fun , too , more than you could shake a stick at . I did n't know it yet , but during the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be started on their way to the top  --  Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne and Helen Hayes and Glenn Hunter  --  picking actors was always my long suit  --  and George Kaufman and Marc Connelly  --  those are only a few  --  and incomparably brilliant people like Mrs. Fiske and Laurette Taylor to be associated with , and hundreds of thousands of dollars to be raised for the Red Cross by an all-star barn-storming tour , and man-to-man negotiations with Mussolini , and a fine old-style battle keeping plays open during the actors ' strike , and star casts to break records with , and all kinds of odd games to be played out with the dear public . We 'd had our comeuppance and it had done us a world of good . But were we still cocky ? That 's a fool question . Of course we were . We 'd have laughed in your face if you 'd tipped us off that the theater was dead and show business was already being born .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
