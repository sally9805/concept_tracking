txt WRITINGS ON ATOMIC PHYSICS REVEAL LACK OF KNOWLEDGE Colonel Johnston Disputes Some of the Findings Of Recent Commentators on the Subject To the Editor of The New York Times : I was impressed with the two interesting articles related to atomic physics in THE TIMES of June 29 . I was impressed not so much for what they contained about the nature of space and the atom but rather by the revelation of the poverty of the current knowledge on the subject . These articles leave the impression that at best the whole fabric is highly speculative and largely based on guesses . The writer of the first article says , " Never before has there been such a concentrated effort of man , pooling all his intellectu.a.1 resources , to solve one of nature 's great riddles ? the elusive atom , which they have even succeeded in photographing , and yet the real mystery remains unsolved . " On the contrary no one has ever photographed the atom and probably never will  --  only statistical shadow effects have been caught by the camera plate . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the consequences of which published in THE TIMES of Jan. 12 , Feb. 2 and March 30 over my signature . Since then I have succeeded in fully solving the molecular structure based on the structural principles of the electron and the proton and their interaction in the hydrogen atom , which is the prototype of the atoms of all other elements . Would Develop Findings . I therefore challenge any statement to the contrary . I would be willing to give a two-hour lecture to a group of from five to ten atomic physicists who know the periodic table of the elements and are up on wave mechanics and chemistry . Each member of the committee may bring his most difficult molecule , not exceeding 200 atoms , for structural solution , provided he gives some of its physical characteristics , origin or mode of manufacture . I will place every atom in its synchronous relation to all the others so that it will operate on the same principle as the protean units of the electron and the proton on the basis of a simple mechanical principle made famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Evolution of Einstein : A ** Record . " This is a very interesting and inspiring article for research workers even though Einstein 's many field theories have completely failed to accomplish their avowed purpose  --  the solution of the great riddle ? the determination of the properties of space that would lead to the understanding of periodic table , the atomic structure as well as the structure of the molecule , the crystal and the organic cell . Einstein 's Generalities . The failure resulted from dealing with generalities instead of dealing with the fundamental structural units and their properties . Thus instead of attempting through the medium of Maxwell 's equations a detailed investigation of the subjective energy structures in the matrices of an objective space of whose only four properties we are cognizant , Einstein sought general methods of approach which eliminated the very problem of structure which alone could lead to the determination of the structural principles of the electron and the proton , the basic units for all other energy forms and phenomena . This failure of Einstein 's insight Into the transcendental laws of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ constancy of the velocity of light relative to the observer instead of the independence of the velocity of light ( gravitation ) relative to source and receiver and constancy relative to the space matrices which are at once both static and dynamic , has led to an impasse in atomic physics and has helped to obscure the true concepts of nature . This , however , is not the fault of Einstein , for he has always kept an open mind and his latest reports indicate that he has at last visions of an objective space and subjective energy forms without which no advance can ever be made . My field theory evolved in completed form in January , 1905 , independent of and different from all other conceptions and first published with derived results as proof of its correctness in THE TIMES of Jan. 12 , was inspired by the action of the gyroscope , the aberration of light , the Doopler effect , the Zeeman effect and the phenomena of electric conduction , notwithstanding the Michelson-Morley experiment which I have never accepted as capable of proving anything definitely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ space and energy forms is alternation of dual properties . The application of this principle to the four dual properties of space lead directly to the structure of the electron and the proton and their interaction in the hydrogen atom and the solution of the quantum theory or mystery . The term relativity has no mathematical or practical application in nature except as related to relative synchronous relation of the four dual properties of the space matrices and the resulting dual energy forms , and the corresponding phenomena in our mechanical world as witnessed by our colorful world  --  all the result of harmonic energy relation between the radiating orbital electron and its governing proton in the nucleus of the atom whether free or bound up in the molecule . It is by virtue of this harmonic energy relation that all atomic phenomena yield to definite mathematical treatment and not to statistical or probability treatment except as may be applied to orbital electrons relative to the probability of capture in the different virtual harmonic orbits  --  that of the real or innermost orbit being the maximum . This is the statistical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ result of an unorganized probability cloud effect but is the effect of the increasing density of the synchronous or harmonic energy orbits the probability of whose occupation by orbital electrons increases from zero at infinity to a maximum at the innermost orbit for the particular group of which there may be five . In atomic and molecular physics , there are no uncertainties ? definite synchronous or harmonic energy relation determine every movement when in equilibrium . The classical laws are never violated . Thus my solution of the great riddle  --  space and energy properties ? rests upon the correct physical concepts , subjected to thorough mathematical investigation , and checked by all available experimental facts . With the true concept of the objective space matrices and their subjective energy forms in all their multiplicities of synchronous operations , every physical phenomenon evolves automatically and passes as it were in review upon the screen of the mind .
