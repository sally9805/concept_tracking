In a ring at Utica , Mich. last week , Joe Louis put Bing Crosby through a few paces . Bing Crosby is a five-gaited saddle horse and Joe Louis was riding him in the highest-toned Negro horse show ever held in the U. S. <P> Negro horse shows are not new , particularly in the South . Most famed is the annual , two-day jamboree at Orange , Va. , a few miles from the farm of Du Pont Heiress Mrs. Randolph Scott . Accompanied by fortune telling , dancing and sideshows , the horses ( mostly nags borrowed from white employers ) are a minor attraction , often compete against mules . Prizes are bushels of oats , hand-me-down automobiles , whatever the committee can round up . Usually there is no attempt to put on dog . <P> But Heavyweight Champion Joe Louis , basking in his prize-ring fame , has given his race big ideas . When the idol of the Negroes , who has grossed well over a million dollars in the past three years , took up riding-in-the-park as a pastime , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed suit , bought expensive saddle horses . Last week Joe Louis persuaded his wealthy friends to ship their horses to Detroit . Except for the fact that there were only six events and 16 horses ( two of them Bing Crosby and McDonald 's Choice , belonging to Sponsor Louis ) , the Utica Riding Club Horse Show was not far different from the flashy horse shows it tried to ape . No. 1 judge of the show , W. C. Overton , whose regular job is supervising the paddock at the Detroit racetrack , thought Joe Louis ' form far inferior in the show ring to the prize ring , awarded him a third-place yellow ribbon in the five-gaited saddle class .
