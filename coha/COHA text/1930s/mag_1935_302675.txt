Swimming records are classified as to whether they are made over a long , short or 20-yd. course . There are swimming records for distances from 50 yd. up to a mile . There are records in yards and records in meters . There are world , national intercollegiate and association records , records for men , records for women . Each of the five swimming styles-free style , back stroke , breast stroke , medley and relay-has its own group of records . Because there are altogether 700 swimming records , hardly a swimming meet is held which does not break one . Accordingly , swimming enthusiasts were less than amazed when they read last week that 27 records had been broken by U. S. swimmers in a three-day meet in the Miami Biltmore Hotel 's luxurious pool at Coral Gables . More remarkable than the number of records was one of the swimmers who had made them , a 17-year-old Miami high-school boy named Ralph Flanagan . Of the 27 records Flanagan had made ten for distances from 300 yd. to 1,650 yd . His closest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> No newcomer to that small group of U. S. athletes for whom a stop watch is as conventional an accessory for public bathing as a pair of trunks , Flanagan last week was making what sportswriters call a " comeback ' ' at an age when many of his contemporaries are barely learning how-to swim . Son of a retired Miami butcher , Ralph Flanagan was discovered in 1926 at a newsboys ' party , by Swimming Coach Steve Forsyth , who developed Katherine Rawls . By 1931 , he had broken his first national record ( 1,650 yd. free style ) . He was on the Olympic team in 1932 . In 1933 , he won the 500-yd. national indoor free style championship against Seattle 's famed Jack Medica . At the outdoor meet that summer , he scored 16 points singlehanded . After that he deserted Coach Forsyth , sank into oblivion . He joined Coach Forsyth again this winter , trained faithfully for last week 's meet . Last week , after the Miami Biltmore meet , he flew to Nassau for the British Colonial meet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
