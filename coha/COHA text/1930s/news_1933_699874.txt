txt The necessity for an increase in rapid transit fares to pave tbie wayl for an early solution of the city's1 financial problems has been recognized definitely by Tammany Hall . That organization , according to information from usually reliable sources , is prepared to " stand for " an increased fare , provided it is realized after the city election . There is only one factor , it was said yesterday , that may alter the situation . That is the possibility that Mayor O'Brien and the Board of Estimate may yet develop other sources of revenue from which the city may obtain the $30,000,000 of new income that Mayor O'Brien promised the city 's bankers when they recently renewed until Dec. 11 some $235,000,000 of municipal obligations . Banking groups and certain city officials who have observed the city 's recent efforts to set up a tax program to raise the $30,000,000 have indicated " off the record " their belief that there . is only a slender chance that a wii*Olp ? BEM revenue'program cairbe eattibildied before the city is faced again with the problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Alibi " for Rise Is Sought . For nearly a year , it is understood , Tammany has been willing to stand for a fare rise , provided a sufficiently strong " alibi " could be built up for that position . The small group of advisers who shape the organization 's policies has been giving more than ordinary attention to the transit situation recently . Whether the fare rise would be in the form of a tax on transit fares , a modification of the existing dual contracts with the B. M. T. and the Interborough , or through unification , has not yet been discussed . It is known that Tammany leaders would prefer that any rise be made effective in connection with unification , so that the argument might be made that the city merely was increasing rates on its own lines with the excess funds all going into its own treasury , instead of into the coffers of " the interests . " There has been no definite decision as to a new rate of fare . Under present financial conditions , however , unification @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recent conferences with holders of company securities . In any event the mere mechanics of a unification program , such as the required public hearings , would delay its achievement for months , even assuming that all the parties could be brought into early agreement The city 's bankers have denied that the extension of city maturities until Dec. 11 was conditioned upon a promise of a fare rise after election . Mayor O'Brien has indicated that reports of a higher fare " deal " are not " worthy of contra- diction . " It has been noticed , however , that he has not in recent weeks made any of the emphatic declarations for the five-cent fare that characterized his first few months in office . One of the most important factors that is said to have influenced Tammany 's decision to abandon the five-cent-fare policy , should current efforts to raise new revenues prove ineffective , Is the 1934 budget situation . Mayor O'Brien has promised the banks a balanced budget for 1934 , stripped of all unessential items . They have indicated to him their desire for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " If the 1934 budget is made up on the basis of a five-cent fare it will carry debt service charges attributable to about $1,000,000,000 of bonded indebtedness on account of city investment in the Interborough , B. M. T. and independent city lines . All of this burden would be placed upon the taxpayers unless the fares on those lines were increased sufficiently to relieve that load . Hunt for Revenue Continues . Mayor O'Brien 's committee on new revenue will meet again today ' to_the discuss the various plans before I it . The committee has many pro ' posals under consideration , but all of them are burdened with handicaps . Some are of admittedly doubtful legality . Others require legislative sanction . Still others are considered of doubtful legality even with Ilegislative sanction . Virtually all carry with them the danger that votes may be alienated from the Tammany ticket next Fall slruld the proposed " taxes " be imposed . The most recent proposal , a 2 per cent tax on commuters , already has evoked hints of reprisals . From Westchester , for example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harry Potter of Newcastle , of a retaliatory tax on residents of New York for use of the Westchester park system . Controller Berry 's plan for the use of a staff of salesmen to sell city securities direct to the public was assailed by Stewart Browne of the United Real Estate Owners Association . He declared the plan would fail here as it did recently in Philadelphia . The mere announcement of the plan , he pointed out , had caused an immediate decline in quotations on city bonds . In financial circles the Berry bond sale plan was viewed with interest . mingled with mild amusement , especially as to his suggestion that long-term bond issues might be marketed direct to the public now . One banker , who declined to be quoted , said it . was difficult to understand how the city expected to sell long-term bonds at par at a time when the banks , with their facilities and experience for such campaigns , were unable to sell them at current low quotations . Mayor O'Brien 's proposal to use the $22,000,000 surplus in the rapid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amusement in banking circles , as well as among city officials better informed as to the status of the sinkin fund in question . The surplus , they said , is entirely invested in the city 's own securities , with no free cash available . In order to obtain the cash , the city securities would have to be sold , and there is virtually no market for such securities . In any event , it is held generally that the surplus is available only for reduction of amortization payments which otherwise would have - to be raised from tax funds and provided for in the 1934 budget . To make any other use of the surplus , it is said , would require State legislation . John F. Curry . Tammany leader , and his closest advisers , it is understood , have been leaning toward a fare increase as a means of stabilizing city credit ever since they sanctioned the abandonment of the fouryear bond plan of financing new city subway construction . At that time John H. Delaney , chairman of the Board of Transportation , was emphatic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fare rise only a matter of time . Subsequent developments are said to have convinced the Tammany group that the only way out of the city 's financial predicament was the creation of a market for its longterm bonds . A rise in rapid transit fares admittedly would do much to bring about such a condition . Tammany 's principal concern at present , according to political observers , is to avoid any open commitment to a higher fare before the , November election , especially in view of Mayor O'Brien 's several declarations that not only this city administration , but also all subsequent administrations , would stand fast for the nickel subway ride . The Board of Estimate has under consideration a list of projects submitted by department heads some time ago , at the request of Mayor O'Brien , as enterprises that might be eligible for Federal aid under the Industrial Recovery Act . A study of the act is being made to ascertain the procedure to be adopted in seeking Federal funds , which will be administered by the State . Among the projects mentioned as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vehicular tunnel , the Triborough Bridge , the completion of the city 's rapidtransit system and the construction of garbage-disposal plants . Mayor O'Brien and his associates on the Board of Estimates hope the new Federal law will make possible the financing of all or a substantial part of these enterprises at a low interest cost and without the necessity of issuing city bonds .
