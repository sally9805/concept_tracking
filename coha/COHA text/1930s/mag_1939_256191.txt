Alongside a dock hard by Britain 's Royal Naval College in fogbound Dartmouth , the strangest ship in the world is being fitted out this week for a series of voyages that are to take her , within the next few years , to many an out-of-the-way corner of the seas . She is the Royal Research Ship Research , a trim 770-ton brigantine . Chief job of naval and civilian scientists , to be quartered in her midships , will be to chart magnetic variations , compare their readings with those taken by the Carnegie Institution 's Carnegie before she blew up while taking on gasoline in Apia , Samoa , in 1929 . <P> " True North " is the direction in which one points to the North Pole , but compass needles point in the direction of the magnetic pole , which is on the Boothia Peninsula in Northern Canada . Hence , only when a compass is roughly on a prolongation of the line from the geographical pole to the magnetic pole does it point true north . From other points in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ angle with true north , and that angle mariners call variation . In the Pacific Ocean the needle points as much as 30 east of the geographical pole ; in parts of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans as much as 45 west . <P> What has plagued navigators is that variation is not only different for different localities , but that from year to year the variation varies because the magnetic pole moves . No one knows why and no one knows precisely how much . Scientists do know that since famed Astronomer Edmund Halley first made his chart of variations , A.D. 1700 , the variation in England has changed by more than 37 . Seaman-scientists of the Research are not sure they will discover the reason for the annual changes . But they will determine the amount of change by comparing their readings with those taken by the Carnegie more than ten years ago . <P> Mariners who correct their compasses for variation also have to correct them for deviation , a local error caused by magnetic metals ( chiefly iron , steel ) in their own craft . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible detail , will have infinitesimal local deviation errors . A throwback to the wooden-ship days , she has a hull of teak , bolts , girders and anchor chain of aluminum bronze . Her cooking utensils and tableware are aluminum ; her four Diesels ( three for auxiliary power , one for propulsion in calms ) are of bronze and aluminum . Her only steel is in their crankshafts and cylinders and it is nonmagnetic . Before she shoves off on her voyages , the clothing of her crew will be carefully searched for metal buttons , nailed shoes which might throw off her compasses by a hair . Big problem for the crew : where to get razors which will shave whiskers , will not shave the accuracy of compass readings .
