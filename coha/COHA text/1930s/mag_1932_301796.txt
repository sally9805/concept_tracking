To the blest fountain of thy blood , Incarnate God , I fly : <P> Here let me wash my spotted soul From crimes of deepest dye . <P> - Isaac Watts . <P> Hymn-Writer Watts , a gentle , humorless metaphor-mixer , wrote many &; many a hymn . Probably he never pictured to himself a Christian , with spotted soul under his arm , flying to the fountain as to a gory laundry . But modern Methodists , sincere as any one in accepting the allegory of the Blood Atonement , raise their eyebrows at the language in which it was couched . Currently a number of hymns by Watts and the Wesleys are slated for omission from a revised hymnal prepared by a joint commission of three Methodist Episcopal Churches ( TIME , March 14 ) . To young people they are " revolting , " says the commission 's Secretary , Dr. John William Langdale . <P> Cried The Presbyterian last week : " One is made very sad . ... It is too bad about the blood atonement being ' revolting ' to young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put blame on the young people . It is the mature and aged hard-shelled worldlings who make the protest . . . . The noblest young people brought up in a Christian way do not revolt from the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ . The fact is they hear too little of it and when they know it , they glory in it as Paul did . If this Methodist movement is the fruitage of the liberalism which is assuming more and more to manage Church affairs , the sooner we call a halt , the better . . . . "
