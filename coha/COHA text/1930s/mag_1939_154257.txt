Assen Jordanolf , at 18 , built the first airplane in Bulgaria . Year later he was a Bulgarian War ace , flying on the Salonika front . When the War ended , and the Neuilly treaty left Bulgaria one plane , he flew that until it was wrecked by a hurricane . In 1921 he heard that $1,000,000 was waiting in the U. S. for anyone who would fly around the world . He came over to collect . <P> Handsome , 42-year-old Assen Jordanoff has never flown around the world , but in the last few years he has collected lots of money . In his early U. S. years he was barnstormer , instructor ( he gave a ground lesson to the late Thomas Alva Edison ) , movie consultant and test pilot . By 1929 he was able to set down his flying notions in good plain English in newspapers and magazines . In 1932 he turned out a book , Flying , and How To Do It , that sold mightily for a dollar . On the strength of this , Funk &; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wings . <P> In Your Wings , in simple , first-person , instructor-to-student dialogue , Jordanoff told how to fly , prudently prefacing the course with lectures on the history of flying , aerodynamics and how to use a parachute . Through 27 chapters he guided the student off the ground , through rudimentary flight , and back to earth again ; told him about motors , propellers , wing lift , etc. ; took off with him again for turns , climbs , glides , later for stalls and spins and aerobatics ; sent him soloing ; proceeding thence through discussions of " avigation , " instruments , fuels , radio , accessories , etc . <P> Assen Jordanoff brightened his book with hundreds of lucid and often humorous illustrative drawings and diagrams , spiced it with asides like : " The difference between a three-point landing and a one-point landing is that after the first you can fly the plane again . . . . Being playful close to the ground may mean an extra order of lilies for your neighborhood florist . " <P> Your Wings was published @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to recommend it to students . Airlines , instrument companies , even CCC camps bought it . Tennessee , where flying courses are provided in State-run air schools , made it a textbook . Your Wings got its mightiest circulation zoom last spring , when the Soviet Government cornered the Russian rights and distributed 100,000 copies . <P> Last week Your Wings , still a best selling book on aviation , seemed headed for another zoom . With the Civil Aeronautics Authority starting a drive to train 20,000 pilots annually in U. S. colleges and universities , Assen Jordanoff 's dialogues were easily the most readable preliminary instructions available . <P> As a companion book to Your Wings , Funk &; Wagnalls last fall published Jordanoff 's Through the Overcast , a course in weather and instrument flying done in the same pithy , well-illustrated style . By itself and packaged with Your Wings it has thus far sold 10,000 copies in the U. S. , is still going at the rate of about 500 a week .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
