A humble Japanese mountaineer one chill evening long ago was sitting close to his stove when there came a knock on the worn brown door of his hut . Opening , he beheld standing before him his Emperor , the Son of Heaven , shivering with a blue-nosed retinue . The Emperor was lost in the mountains . No food had been in the royal stomach for some time . So honored was the mountaineer by the visit , so solicitous was he for his Emperor 's health that he set out an unusually large dish of his best seaweed jelly . When the meal was over the humble man , in deference to deity , threw away what the Son of Heaven could not eat . When the Emperor departed next morning , the mountaineer , thrifty , went after his lost delicacy . It had been frostbitten during the night . As the morning sun warmed it , the jelly disintegrated . Water separated from it into a little pool leaving behind a light , glistening mass like delicate tissue-paper flowers . The mountaineer , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in water , saw it resume its normal form , laid the foundations for the great agar-agar industry of Japan . The fundamental process has not changed since the mountaineer 's discovery . <P> Last week , George Ross Robertson , professor of chemistry at the University of California at Los Angeles , reported to the American Chemical Society that California financiers and scientists are developing the ancient Japanese industry , have built in California the only agar plant in the world outside of the Orient . Several years ago Japanese fishermen discovered some agar-bearing sea moss on the Los Angeles Harbor breakwater . Realizing that nostalgic Orientals in the U. S. love bird's-nest soup and knowing that agar-agar is an ingredient , they built a small factory , which Occidentals have taken over , moved , modernized . <P> The source of U. S. agar is a dark red alga familiar along the beaches of southern California . The alga grows generally in turbulent waters , must be picked by hand . Engineers are at present at work on a mowing machine which will stand rough seas , make production @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deep where only experienced divers can gather it . The factory has to pay $180 per ton to these seagoing harvest hands . <P> Agar is used chiefly as a culture medium in bacteriology because it keeps its form at higher temperatures than gelatin . Petroleum-agar , a familiar household intestinal lubricant , contains the substance in small quantities . It is useful in the making of glue , transparent silk , paper .
