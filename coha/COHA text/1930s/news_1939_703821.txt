txt France strengthened her empire defenses in Africa and put them on the alert today following reports of Italian troop concentrations near the borders of two fascist-coveted French territories . Reliable foreign circles in London said last night that Italy had called up 150,000 reservists and planned to have 300,000 in service by Spring , according to The Associated Press . In Tunisia , French protectorate , troops were held in barracks and airplanes were made ready for immediate flight in case of trouble . Submarine patrols surveyed the Tunisian coast and important troop reinforcements had been sent to the central stretches of Tunisia 's frontier with Italian Libya . Heavy artillery reinforcements were shipped aboard the liner Chenonceaux from Marseille to Jibuti , French colonial seaport on the Straits of Bab el Mandeb and one object of the clamor for concessions aroused by the Italian press and public . French troops established garrisons in a strategic twelve and a half mile strip of coastal territory between French Somaliland and Italian Eritrea , retaking an area once ceded to Italy . France also was reported to have sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French Tunisia . French authorities began recruiting natives in Jibuti to match Italian forces along the border of French Somaliland . Italian forces along the frontier were reported to number 15,000 . Italian Ethiopia and Eritrea border French Somaliland . Meanwhile , as a preparedness test of France 's frontier with Germany , the Moselle Department was ordered in a " state of alert " for thirty-six hours beginning next Wednesday . Fascist tumult for the fulfillment of Italy 's " natural aspirations " has centered since last Nov. 30 in clamor for Tunisia and Jibuti. the capital of French Somaliland . Recent dispatches from Jibuti , coastal terminus of the railroad from Addis Ababa , Italian Ethio- the crash of the Douglas bomber near Los Angeles with Paul Chemidlin , a member of the French mission , aboard , which first brought to public attention the fact that the French experts were in this country to purchase airplanes , restrictions were so tightened that they never saw the P-40 , General Craig said . The dissension between upholders of the two points of view reached such a pitch that Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Treasury could have nothing further to do with the situation until it was made public . This was brought out in the testimony of John W. Hanes , Assistant Secretary of the Treasury . Also , on Dec. 30 , Mr. Morgenthau advised the Secretary of War , Mr. Woodring , that it would probably be impossible to go through with the French purchase . Mr. Morgenthau 's testimony made it clear that the visit of the French mission was first brought to official attention by William C. Bullitt , Ambassador to France , who had just arrived home on leave . Mr. Bullitt called on Mr. Morgenthau and ' asked him to aid the French experts by putting them in touch with the proper aviation authorities . Before doing anything about this request , Mr. Morgenthau said , he consulted Sumner Welles , who was acting Secretary of State in Secretary Hull 's absence at the PanAmerican Conference in Lima , to ascertain whether the French mission were properly accredited by its own government . Reassured on this point , his next concern was whether the French Government had the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there would be no possible violation of the Johnson act forbidding the extending of credit to governments which are in default of their debts to the United States . When the question of military secrets entered the picture , it was felt best to put the decision up to President Roosevelt . According to Mr. Morgenthau 's testimony , there were apparently two discussions with the President , each following a regular Cabinet meeting . At the first one he , Mr. Woodring and Mr. Welles talked with the President . At the other Mr. Morgenthau , Secretary Swanson of the Navy , Secretary Woodring and Mr. Welles participated . President 's Letters Secret As a result of these talks , Mr. Roosevelt sent a letter , or letters ? this point is not clear in the transcript ? to all the departments concerned , apparently instructing them to extend the fullest possible cooperation to the French mission , even to the extent of letting its members see and fly in the airplanes the Air Corps wanted to keep from their inspection . The Military Affairs Committee , at the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this letter , or letters , for its records from Mr. Morgenthau . Mr. Nye , Senator Clark and others who feared the Administration was going too far toward " entangling alliances " in extending unusual facilities to the French mission , wanted to see on exactly what grounds the President issued his instructions . Mr. Morgenthau , however , declined to furnish a copy . He wrote as follows to Senator Sheppard , chairman ' of the committee : " I have given consideration to your letter of Jan. 30 in which you request that I furnish you a copy of a letter or other authority from the President instructing me to proceed , in cooperation with the War and Navy Departments , to assist the French Aviation Commission in the ' purchase of airplanes in the United States . " Since your request relates not to one , but to many confidential communications , written and oral , between the President and departments of the government , I regret that lacking specific authorization from him I am not at liberty to comply with it . " It was understood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roosevelt sent to the Treasury and War and Navy Departments were no longer in those departments . Whether this was because they had been returned to the White House could not be learned . Morgenthau " ' Proud " of It Mr. Morgenthau , whatever may I have been his opinion when the preliminary negotiations were under way , took the President 's view and decided the proposed $65,000 , - 000 purchas was " good business , " , for the reason that the French money would enable the American aviation industry the better to supply the needs of this country 's Air Corps . " That is what motivated us , " he told the committee . " and instead of being ashamed I think it is something to be proud of ? $65,000 , - 000 for American workmen 's pockets is good stuff , and I do not see 1why ' there is anything particularly secret about it or anything particularly to apologize for . " Mr. Morgenthau was likewise insistent that the stabilization fund had never been used to extend credit to France , as was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have never extended any credit to anybody , " he said . " All our transactions are gone through every day and closed every night . There has never been one franc or one shilling of credit extended to anybody at any time since the stabilization fund has been in existence . " The Administration policy involved in the treatment of the French Mission was elaborated upon by Secretary Woodring in an exchange with Mr. Clark . The Missouri Senator held that the crash of the Douglas bomber , the only one of its kind , on the test flight with Mr. Chemidlin , would prevent that plane from being entered in the air corps contest scheduled for next month in competition with other planes built to the same general specifications . " Yes , I do not think we would have purchased  --  well , if they had sold it to the French Government , I doubt very much whether they would have entered in the competition , " Mr. Woodring said . " That is what I say , " Mr. Clark rejoined ? " if they sold it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Although we would rather that they would have sold it to the French Government than enter it in the competition , " Mr. Woodring replied , " we would want them to do that , because in the manufacturing of the French order it would lower ? if we gave them an order it would lower the unit cost to the United States Government . " Cmild Not Deliver Planes However , the French Mission found that it was technically impossible to manufacture the 1,000 planes they wanted by next . July 1 . This was the subject of an exchange between Mr. Woodring and Mr. Morgenthau . The Secretary of the Treasury had just testified that the French must have the delivery date they specified , when Mr. Woodring interrupts ' as follows : " I told you this before and I will tell you again ? if they want them by the first of July they will never buy an airplane in this country . They can not be delivered in that time . " " That is what they wanted , delivery by the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no use continuing saying that , " Mr. Woodring said , " because I told you before they could not have a plane delivered by the first of July . " One of the interesting sidelights the transcript provided was , that of the twelve Democrats and five Republicans who make up the committee membership , only Senator Minton attempted to speak in defense of the Administration . All of the other questions were put by members who apparently desired to cast doubt on the wisdom of the Administration 's procedure and policy . Suggestions that the committee might use the incident as a basis for drafting more stringent legislation in protection of military secrets , however , seemed to meet with little encouragement . Best Planes Were Not Seen 13 , The Associated Press . WASHINGTON , Feb. 18 . ? Disclosure of testimony , taken by the Senate Committee on Military Affairs , that a French air mission considered only two American warplanes equal to similar German ships brought comment from War Department sources today that this government had better and faster planes than any the French saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ today that the final French orders for 515 American planes , only one of which was of the latest type available to the army , would not " in any way " delay the construction of 3,000 new planer. for the army under the Administration 's proposed rearmament program . In other War Department quarters it was pointed out that the French mission had not seen the army 's experimental XP-38 fighter which has attained speeds in excess of 400 miles an hour in a dash across the country . From other quarters there were hints that the committee has been told that the army has in the process of manufacture a bomber considered to be much more effective than the Douglas ship . Craig for Selling Abroad In the new disclosures of testimony taken by the committee it was revealed that General Craig , while saying that the sale of 100 Douglas light bombers came in " a little different " ' classification , endorsed in general President Roosevelt 's policy in selling American military planes abroad . General Craig told the committee that , starting from scratch , manufacturers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new model in twelve months and added that eighteen months would be required to turn out 300 bombers . Excerpts from the testimony of Secretary Morgenthau quoted him as follows : " You want to know what the thought was . " ( In ? response to a question from Senator Clark . ) " The thought was this this money , these people being here , that these orders would be placed at once , and they ( The French ) would pay for the development cost and their orders would be out of the way and be delivered before Congress voted the money ( for the army air expansion ) and the army would have a chance to have that competition later , and that - all of the development costs will be paid for by the French , and we would get plants in production that are idle now . " Now the thought , as I say , that the President had , with these other Cabinet officers , was that here was this money ? $65,000,000 good , hard cash  --  to go into the pockets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately and gotten out of the way before our American business was ready . " General Craig discussed foreign sales of planes in general terms in response to a question from Senator Austin . The army Chief of Staff asserted it was the " soundest kind of a proposition " to seek to place airplane products in foreign markets . Under questioning by Senator Nye Mr. Johnson said that the same procedure which was employed to grant the French mission permission to see the Douglas bombers would be employed if any other country made a request to purchase warplanes here . " Suppose another foreign purchaser wanted the particular bomber that was involved , and came to America for that purpose  --  would there he permission given to fly in that plane without going through what was gone through to accomplish that in the matter under discussion , " Mr. Nye asked . " The practice , whether you call it an exception or not , as to that plane would apply to any other government , " Mr. Johnson replied .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
