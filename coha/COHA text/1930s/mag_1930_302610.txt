While members of Chicago 's Union League Club strove last week to find a successor to Calvin Coolidge ( see below ) , members of New York 's Union League Club hustled the nude figure of Paul Robeson to the club librarian 's office . <P> Once yearly the dusty , mid-Victorian Union League , a semipolitical ( Republican ) organization with some social pretensions , pays its respects to Art with an exhibition to which members may bring their wives and daughters . Advertised as chef d'oeuvre of last week 's exhibition was the lifesize , specifically nude bronzed plaster cast of Paul Robeson , Negro baritone , Shakespearean actor , onetime Rutgers football star , which Sculptor Antonio Salemme sent last summer to Philadelphia , which it shocked ( TIME , June 30 ) . For most of the summer it has been on view at the Brooklyn Museum of Art . <P> Union League members viewed nude Paul Robeson with horror last week , rushed with complaints to portly , whitechinned Dr. George Frederick Kunz , gem expert of Tiffany &; Co. , chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> " It is a beautiful piece of art , " said Dr. Kunz , " but such realism is out of place in this salon . " <P> Sculptor Salemme dutifully applied a plaster figleaf as a poultice to outraged sensibilities . The members of the art committee viewed the amended Robeson , sadly shook their heads . <P> Salemme 's Robeson was removed the night before the exhibit opened . To reporters suave Dr. Kunz explained that the statue had not been removed on racial or physiological grounds . " It was n't that at all , " said he . <P> " It was because this turned out to be an ecclesiastical show ; ecclesiastical and also Icelandic . We have a full length portrait of Cardinal Hayes , one of Bishop Stires by Frank O. Salisbury , one of Rabbi Wise , and three of Bishop Manning . Obviously the nude figure of Robeson would have been inappropriate . <P> " It is absurd to think that the club might rule out the Robeson figure on racial lines . Do you know of any other club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
