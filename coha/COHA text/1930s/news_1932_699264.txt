txt sir Ronald Lindsay , British Ambassae dor , and Paul Claude , French Arai bassador , called on Secretary of State Stimson today , and their visits ! confirmed reports from abroad that Great Britain and France would seeld an extension of the Hoover moray torium so that they would not be compelled to make payments on wait debts due to the United States ort Dec. : 15 . The understanding was that the British Ambassador had delivered si note from his government , and that M. Claudel had discussed a eimiiae note , which is expected from France tomorrow . Secretary Stimson and other State Department officials , however , refused to discuss the visits of the foreign representatives or the probable attitude of the administration on the debt question . President Hoover will arrive here from Palo Alto next Tuesday and it is probable that a definite statement of the administration 's attitude will await his return . While this uncertainty regarding what Great Britain and France will do about their Dec. 15 payments was troubling State Department officials , the Treasury Department announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $444,920 on her debt , which was due today , and that Hump gary had served notice that she would be unable to meet her De+ cember payment of $40,729 . Gore many has already received a posts ponement of $7,800,000 owed on : mixed claims and costs of the army , of occupation . None of the other , debtor nations has indicated ite plans . Britain Is Chief Debtor . Great Britain is the principal debtor under the funding agree+ ments and on Dec. 15 $95,550,000 isl due from her , made up of $30,000,000 principal and $65,550,000 interest . ' France on that date will owe $1944 261,432 , made up entirely of interest. , Senatorial reaction among the fevr , members here left some hope of leniency by Congress if Great Britairt and France ask for a postponement of the December payments and even . tual revision of their debt agreed ments . Senator Swanson , who will become chairman of the Foreign Relations ! Committee in the Congress which convenes March 4 , said : " Any step for a moratorium or anY move that does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be opposed by me . I do not care to say at this time whether I would object to a moratorium for Great Britain on Dec. 15 until all the in-P formation has been laid before this country . " The Democratic platform advocates a " firm foreign policy " that would include " the sanctity of treaties and the maintenance of good faith and of good-will in financial obligations . " ' " We oppose , " the platform added , " cancellation of the debts owing to the United States by foreign nations . " 3 Senator Byrnes , another Democrat , said he opposed a moratorium for Great Britain " with the facts now at hand " but added : " Of course , I may be disposed to support another moratorium if Great Britain makes out a case that justifies further delay in the payment o.2 her debts to this country . But gene erally speaking , I can not see what good would be gained from another postponement in the payments . " Borah Withholds View . Senator Borah , who probably wills continue as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duck " session beginning in Demme ber , declined to give his view upon the reported British note until he had learned its contents . He heete however , previously said he would support revision if the.debtor nations agreed upon a program , for arniameat reduction to ' aid in economic recovery , and has also emphasized the need to wipe gut German repara- ' tions if Europe is to expect a readjustment of her debt to this country . Senator Reed , who in the last session of Congress , was an outspoken opponent of any move looking to cancellation , said : " As I see conditions , certainly there would be no excuse whatever for any abatement in the payments 1 that are due to us from the Continent of Europe . I am nokaufficiently ' familiar with British affairs to . be able to say whether they are able to make an entire payment on Dec. 15 or not . If not , the debt - settlement agreement already made provides for a partial moratorium and that , in my opinion , is sufficient to meet the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten the very great reductions which were made by us when these - debts were funded , and seems to have forgotten likewise that America issued its bonds to raise money for Europe and these bonds still rave to be paid . If the bonds are not paid by the people who got the money , they will . have to be paid by the United States I Government , which did not get the money . " Lindsay Confers 15 Minutes . Ambassador Lindsay went to the State Department in the forenoon and was closeted with Secretary Samson . for about fifteen minutes ; His visit attracted unusual interest because of the publication of dispatches from London that forecast early submission of a note dealing with debts . The British Ambassador returned to this country from England only about a week ago , and diplomatic circles believed he had discussed the debt *problem at length with his own Foreign Office just before he sailed . Therefore , he was in a position to give Mr. Stimson a firsthand account of the sentiment ' at home . Administration officials have realized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ almost immediately after the Presidential election and Secretary Stimson was said to be fully informed as to the position President Hoover might be expected to take . The foreign governments avoided agitating the question until after the election to prevent if possible any detailed preelection statement by either candidate as to a continuance of the moratorium or revision . So far as could be learned here no active negotiations have been conducted abroad between British officials and American diplomatic representatives , with the possible exception of informal discussions by Norman H. Davis . Suggestions that Ambassador Mellon had participated in discussions of the British debt evoked the convent , " nonsense . " Speculation on Hoover 's Stand . There Is much speculation here as to what attitude President Hoover will take when he gets back to Washington . It is believed that he can not avoid , even if he so desired , taking some position and making it known to Congress in his annual message . There were reports that he had been in communication with Mr. Stimson by telephone today but these could not be confirmed . President @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regarding a.continuation of the moratorium he put into effect for the fiscal year 1932 with the consent of Congress . If , as expected here , Great Britain in its note pictures a situation that would seriously retard world economic recovery unless the moratorium were continued and the war debts eventually revised , it is believed Mr. Hoover will give his views to Congress and the country despite the fact that he will go out of office on March 4 . Reports persisted here that Mr. Hoover would consult President-elect Roosevelt , but no one would confirm them . During the Presidential campaign President Hoover reiterated that he was opposed to cancellation , but did not shut the door on a policy of leniency , particularly if such a course would promote foreign trade . For instance , in his Des Moines speech he said : " If for some annual payment we are offered some other tangible form of compensation , such as the expansion of markets for American agriculture and labor and the restoration and maintenance of our prosperity , then I am sure our citizens would consider such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ President Hoover asked Congress to recreate the World War Debt Commission to consider revision of the war debts , the conviction has been growing in official and diplomatic circles that some definite steps would have to be taken soon to relieve Europe of at least a part of the debt burden if economic recovery was to be had . Can Defer Principal Payments . Under the debt agreements the executive branch of the government , without Congressional sanction , can postpone for two years the amount any debtor nation owes for the reduction of principal . It can not , however , postpone interest without action by Congress , and this , in the case of Great Britain at least , is the all-important factor in the present situation . While at the time the debt agreemerits were made there was someidetbate-as to the authority ' of thelTreasury to extend leniency , the administration then in power said it would not attempt to put into effect any . agreement except with the ratification of Congress , and this has been the continuing policy Ever since the debt agreements were negotiated Treasury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the British agreement , which imposed much sterner terrors than any of the others , Would come first , In fact , by some officials , the stiff terms of the British agreement have been looked upon as the weak link in a policy that Yirmly opposed any change . Some experts have even figured that if the British agreement were followed out to its conclusion the United States would make an actual profit . As long ago as Deo. 11 , 1931 , Mr. Mellon , then Secretary of the Treasury , forecast a situation virtually identical with that which is now said to have developed , with an argument for revision of the British agreement based largely on the depreciation of the British currency and the sharp decline in commodity prices since the debt was incurred . At that time , in defending President Hoover 's request for a moratorium , Mr , Mellon said : " Take the ease of Great Britain , our best customer , which even in the depression year 1930 took$678,000,000 worth of American agricultural and industrial products . The economic and , financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her payments to us . The series of events through which Great Britain was forced'off the gold standard are too recent to require enumeration . Today the pound sterling is settling at $3.315 to the pound , which is 32 per cent discount as compared with last year , when it stood at parity , $4.866 . " All debts to Great Britain from foreign governments except reparation payments , which are not being collected at all this year and are not likely to be collected in full next year , are payable in sterling . Her debt to us is payable in gold dollars . The combined effect of these unfavorable factors results in an enormously increased burden for the people of Great Britain . Illustrates Added Burden . " Payments due during the present fiscal year will serve to exemplify the magnitude of the additional burden . With the pound sterling at par , the British treasury needs 132,800 , - 000 in order to pay us $159,500,000 . With the pound sterling at the rate at which it sold on Dec. 10 , 1931 , it would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or 47 per cent . Or , in other words , the burden on the British taxpayer is increased by onehalf . " In announcing the failure of the Greek and Hungarian Governments to meet their obligations , Secretary Mills said : ? " There was due and payable today under the terms of the debt-funding agreement with the government of Greece on account of the 4 per cent twenty-year loan made on May 10 , 1920 , the sum of $444,920 , of which $227,000 represents an instalment due on account of principal , and $217,920 represents semi-annual interest . The payment has not been received . ' The Hungarian Government has officially notified the United States Government that it does not have the necessary foreign exchange with which to make the ? payment due the United States on Dec , 15 , 1932 , under the debt-funding agreement . The amount due on Dec. 15 , 1982 , ' is $40 , - 729.35 , of which $12,285 represents principal and $28 ; 444:35 ' represents semi-annual interest .
