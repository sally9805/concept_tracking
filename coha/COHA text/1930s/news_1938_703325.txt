txt Republican.leadership in the Massachusetts House today abandoned its plan to seek reconsideration on forced concurrence with Senate action in passing the $76,000,000 State budget . Instead of rallying shattered forces , divided by nearly 30 Republicans stepping out of Party ranks yesterday . House leaders will seek to kill the entire budget when it comes back from the Senate next Tuesday for enactment . Such parliamentary action will force Gov . Charles F. Hurley to submit an entire new budget and will force him to accept or refuse responsibility for adding approximately $5,000,000 to the highway appropriation in the State estimate . Back of the Republican defeat yesterday stood the irresistible patronage pressure of Governor Hurley , various leaders charged . They told of numerous Republicans being called to the Governor 's office to be urged to vote for the Senate-approved budget . In only minor instances , involving a few thousand dollars , did the House disagree with the Senate . The statistical summary of the chronological budget progress to date is : Hurley recommendations $72,488,502 Original House budgetr $81,024,656 Senate budget $76,069,596 House revised budget @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pressure for the Senate total places directly upon his shoulders responsibility for the highest budget in the history of the State . The present total exceeds by more than $3,500,000 the record 1936 budget in the James M. Curley Administration . During verbal pyrotechnics in the House , Representative Albert F. Bigelow ( R ) , Chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee , declared " these votes take me back to the good old Curley days . " - By concurring with the Senate , the House completely reversed its previous approval of a $10,000,000 item for distribution to cities and towns for highway projects to be conducted as unemployment relief . In place of this item , the House and Senate agreed to raise State highway appropriations by approximately $5,000,000 . The Massachusetts Federation of Taxpayers Asswiations already has warned that this action will result In local tax rates in 1939 being raised $1.38 per $1,000 valuation , because of local budget deficits which will be forced this year . Federal Penalties The Republican leadership in the House , headed by Representative Horace T. Cahill , Speaker of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the $10,000,000 item on the ground this would prevent any diversion of highway fund money to other purposes and thus avoid Federal Government penalties totalling $3,000,000 . These penalties are threatened because of past diversions and the Governor 's plan for further diversion this year . The program as approved by the House and Senate leaves approximately $4,000,000 for diversion , if the Governor so desires . Originally , the Governor has proposed diversion of $8,000,000 . Budget experts forecast a State tax of $14,000,000 as a result of the budget action , although the Governor had proposed originally an $8 , - 000,000 tax . This has a direct boosting effect upon local tax rates , inasmuch as this tax is assessed upon cities and towns to finance any State budget deficit . Critics of the Republican leadership contend , however , that the G. 0 . P. program could boost the State tax to $18,000,000 or $19,000,000 . Un- less the $10,000,000 item for local highway work was used to lighten the welfare burden , the distribution would not balance the increased State tax . The loyal G. 0 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appropriations will give Governor Hurley and the State Department of Public Works considerably more money to spend in election year , with an increased amount of patronage to distribute effectively . To block such activity they had favored the $10,000,000 distribution to remove from Administration control the spending of the money . Strategy Defeated Just before adjournment yesterday , Representative John F. Aspell of Boston , Democratic Floor Leader , attempted to force through a motion for reconsideration . This was clever strategy , inasmuch as Mr. Aspell had hoped that reconsideration would be killed and thus the budget fight would be over . If he had succeeded , Republican leaders would not have had time in which to attempt to recapture lost strength . However , a motion for adjournment was lowed through by the G. 0 . P. group . An Aspell demand for a roll call vote on adjournment was ignored by Speaker Cahill who marched off the rostrum . Had Mr. Aspell won a roll call he might have prevented adjournment and gained action on his reconsideration motion .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
