To most Bostonians , Massachusetts ' legal holiday on April 19 is better known as the day of The Marathon than the anniversary of the first battle of the Revolutionary War . For parents who have to stand on a curbstone for hours so that their saucer-eyed brood may catch a glimpse of the first gaunt &; gasping runner plodding along Commonwealth Avenue , and for motorists who are forced to detour all around town , the Marathon is a notorious nuisance . But for chronic gawps , students of foot racing and officials of the Boston Athletic Association ( who sponsor the run ) , it is a great event . <P> Last week , for the first time in 27 years , it was a rainy Patriots ' Day . Less than 100,000 spectators lined the 26-mile , 385-yard route , from the little town of Hopkinton-via Natick , Wellesley and Newton - to the Boston A. A. clubhouse on Exeter Street . But the rain that was responsible for the smallest turnout in many years was also responsible for a new record in the annals of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fine field at the starting line : 179 U. S. and Canadian runners , including five onetime champions . Hopkinton yokels , looking them over as though they were horses in a paddock , pointed to a stolid , bronze-skinned young man . " Look , there 's the Indian , Tarzan Brown , who won in 1936 . But he went over to those Olympics and has n't been the same since . Finished 31st two years ago and 54th last year . He 'll set the pace-and burn himself out . " <P> This year Ellison ( " Tarzan " ) Brown , 24-year-old Narragansett Indian from Westerly , R. I. , did not follow his usual custom . He hung back , let Leslie Pawson , the favorite , go out in front . At Natick the Rhode Island Redskin ( whose Indian name , Attuck-Quock-Wussete , means Deer-foot ) found himself leading the pack , along with Walter Young , 1937 winner . Together they loped along for twelve miles . <P> When they reached the first of the three roller-coaster Newton hills , Tarzan decided @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Opening his mouth wide for a minute he let the raindrops trickle in . Then , refreshed , he streaked up the hill like a supercharged racing car . From then on , it was a lonely run . <P> Lengthening the gap on each hill , the wooden-faced Indian , pattering along in the rain , was soon out of sight of his closest rival . When he reached the finish line , a roar of applause greeted him . His time : 2 hr. , 28 min. , 51 4/5 sec. - more than 27 seconds faster than the alltime record set by Japan 's Kitei Son in the 1936 Olympics . Crowned with the traditional laurel wreath and hailed as a super-runner , Marathoner Brown , a stone mason by trade , smiled feebly . Said he : " I would like to have a steady job instead . " <P> Another super-marathoner , 50-year-old Clarence DeMar , felt the same way last week . Seven-time winner of the Boston Marathon , DeMar , who finished 30th last week , had a " Situations Wanted " ad in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
