In Los Angeles one night last week Tennist Ellsworth Vines beat Fred Perry 4-6 , 13-11 , 8-10 , 6-2 , 6-3 in the opening encounter of their second year of coast-to-coast professional barnstorming . This year 's tour has a new promoter and a new mode of pay . Instead of Francis T. Hunter , the promoter is Chicago 's Jack Harris , promotion chief of the Wilson Sporting Goods Co . The mode of pay-to stimulate competition and quell suspicions of collusion after they finished all-even last year-is a bonus for each victory ( in addition to salary ) and a bonus for the greatest number of victories at the end of the 75-match season . To the victor also goes a possible $30,000 for a tour with Donald Budge next year , if Mr. Budge turns pro .
