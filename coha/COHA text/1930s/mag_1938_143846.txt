Last August Franklin Roosevelt plucked goggle-eyed Frank McNinch , one of the liveliest members of the Federal Power Commission , and made him chairman of the Federal Communications Commission . His job was to inject some New Deal vigor into the politics-ridden FCC . Last week the results became apparent . <P> Last month Mae West brought down a deluge of criticism from all over the U. S. by a sexy burlesque of the story of Adam &; Eve ( TIME , Dec. 27 ) . * Among the 1,000-odd letters of criticism that showered on National Broadcasting Co. was one from FCC asking for a transcript of the program . Last week NBC President Lenox R. Lohr got another letter from FCC , signed by Chairman Frank McNinch . Taking time out from such radio supervising jobs as dividing up the ether , allotting slices of it to broadcasting stations and licensing operators , Mr. McNinch sounded off on Mae West : <P> " The admittedly objectionable character of these features is , in our opinion , attributable to the lack of a proper conception of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the homes , schools , automobiles , religious , social and economic institutions , as well as clubs , hotels , trains and other places , reaching in the aggregate a much larger number of people daily than any other means of communication and carrying its message to men , women and children of all ages . <P> " A clear recognition of the social , civil and moral responsibility for the effect upon listeners of all classes and ages requires such a high standard for programs as would insure against features that are suggestive , vulgar , immoral or of such other character as may be offensive to the great mass of right-thinking , clean-minded American citizens . " <P> Although it has long been recognized that the rights and privileges of broadcasters are not so great as those of the press , this letter pointed the difference in official black &; white . The press , in spite of its guaranteed freedom , is not permitted to be immoral , obscene or libelous . But in order to preserve freedom of expression , freedom of artistic taste and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be , the press is permitted to be vulgar , if not suggestive , to be just as offensive as it likes to " right-thinking people . " By FCC doctrine as laid down by Mr. McNinch , the radio may reflect only views and tastes agreeable to one group , those whom FCC defines as " right-thinking " people . Mr. McNinch went on still further to restrict the field of radio . He wrote : <P> " In our present system and the statute under which the Federal Communications Commission functions , the Commission has no power of censorship , but this power and responsibility rests squarely and unavoidably upon the licensee . . . . Licenses are granted without any compensation by the licensee to the Government and solely for the puroose of serving the public interest , and , hence , the broadcaster must accept , along with the privilege granted , a definite , inescapable and high public trust in the use of the facilities licensed . . . .                 @ @ @ @
