Like Lady Macbeth , surgeons and x-ray specialists forever worry about their hands . Surgeons wring theirs to keep them supple , and pray that arthritis may never stiffen the joints . X-ray specialists search their hands for blemishes , and pray that x-ray burns may never compel an amputation . <P> To the thickening of the skin of their hands , caused by repeated exposure to x-rays , roentgenologists are reconciled . Upon the assurance of Mayo Clinicians many an x-ray man has ceased to wear heavy lead-filled rubber gloves and aprons as a positive shield against x-rays which , while harmless to the patient , might seriously injure the examiner . Mayo Clinicians assured the profession that ordinary leather gloves and plain clothing gave the x-ray technician all the protection he needed . Recently , however , Mayo radiologists tested their data , found themselves wrong and frankly recanted in the American Journal of Roentgenology . Not to leather gloves and plain clothing went credit for the fact that Mayo Clinicians had suffered no harm but to the unexpected ability of human beings to stand strong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago , I would have been willing to endorse their statement , " exclaimed Professor Gottwald Schwarz , University of Vienna 's longtime radiologist . " . . . But accidentally I lately suffered a needle prick of the nail cuticle of my left index finger . This trifling injury gradually developed into an ulcer which today , after the lapse of one year , still does not show the least tendency toward healing . " Day &; night Professor Schwarz asks himself : " Have I a cancer ? Should I have the finger tip cut off ? " <P> To Editor Lawrence Reynolds of the American Journal of Roentgenology he sent a picture of his forefinger and advice to colleagues that they use a long-handled wooden spoon to touch patients whom they examine by x-rays . <P> Dr. Reynolds published the woeful information last week , and accompanied it with hopeful advice from the head of the Albert Soiland Radiological Clinic of Los Angeles . Dr. Soiland , 61 , has been using x-rays for 38 years . As a result the skin of his hands is thick and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to soothe them with various ointments and lotions . Dr. Soiland sails yachts in his leisure time . Last year it dawned on him that his hands felt better after being doused in salt water . He at once experimented in his laboratory with wet salt dressings , found the benefits to his hands real . Pacific Ocean water seemed to do him more good than Atlantic water , which is less salty . " Now , " wrote he last week . " I frequently go to sleep with a pair of cotton gloves on my hands , with a little extra padding over the back and fingers , soaked with either sea water or normal saline solution .
