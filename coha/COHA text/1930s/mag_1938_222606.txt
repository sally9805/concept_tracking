Assembled there , in a confused and earnest clot , were 150 delegates to the 21st national convention of the Socialist Party . Among them few were more confused , none was more earnest than their three-time candidate for the Presidency of the U. S. , grey Norman Thomas . <P> The chances for any sort of progressive national party in 1940 were no greater after the Socialists had acted upon their prime political problem of the moment : whether , when , and how to align with the State and local laborite groups patterned upon New York 's American Labor Party .

It followed University of Chicago 's Economist Maynard Kreuger in permitting affiliation with other groups only on condition that Socialists oppose any capitalist candidate endorsed by their nominal allies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ allegiance , the Socialists thus retained not only their integrity but their status as negligible quantities in next fall 's Congressional elections .
