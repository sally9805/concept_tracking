Spick &; span in a full-dress Admiral 's uniform King George stood with Queen Elizabeth one day last week in Belfast 's City Hall on a State visit to the capital of loyal Northern Ireland . <P> BOOM ! In the middle of the welcoming addresses a bomb exploded . It had been placed with a length of fuse in a warehouse a quarter of a mile from the route over which the royal party had just passed . It looked like an " Irish gesture . " not intended to destroy but merely to attract attention . Nobody was killed . The King &; Queen hearing the noise , started with alarm but were quickly informed that a leaking gas main had accidentally exploded . Not until the royal visit was over did Ulster 's police reveal the truth , that the Irish Free State 's Republican Army , most antiroyalist element in Ireland , had tried to make the King 's visit a fiasco , had in the past 24 hours burned 28 customs houses on the Free State-Ulster border , dynamited a railway bridge near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exploded not far from Belfast 's West End police barracks . Nearby a man lay badly beaten up . This , police thought , was another " gesture " to frighten into silence anybody who knew too much .
