txt Mr. OWEN J. ROBERTS , who took his seat in the Supreme Court of . the United States last Monday , was confirmed by the Senate without opposition . A. question had , indeed , been raised concerning one statement made by him in an address to the New York State Bar Association . It had to do with his belief that the Eighteenth Amendment was out of place in the Constitution . But it was explained in his behalf that this was only a " legal opinion , " and did not imply that Mr. ROBERTS was opposed to prohibition . So a tired Senate let that go . But some Senators might have been roused against Mr. ROBERTS if they had taken due note of another part of the same address . This was where Mr. ROBERTS was speaking of the right of judges to give a jury full instructions about not only the law but the weight of evidence . He made this explicit reference to a project long a favorite with a surprising number of Senators : You are familiar with the fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ session , a statute which has got pretty far , to deprive Federal judges of any right or power to outline the evidence or comment on the facts to a jury . You are familiar with ? the- fact that in a number of States that is now the law . Indeed , there are some States , as I undersi and it , where a judge is permitted to charge before counsel addresses a jury and to charge only on points of law , and therefore the learned gentleman , after having acted more or less as a. referee duri-ng the rounds of the battle , sits up and reads a legal essay , and then must ' subside into : silence while counsel roam over the field and do pretty much as they like . All ' this , asserted Mr .. ROBERTS , was not at all his idea of a. trial or his conception of a judge . The presiding judge'in au important case knows how . easily . a . jury .. may become confused by conflicting evidence , and . feels it his duty to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do it improperly . If a judge were both clever and partial , he might be able to bring about . an unjust verdict by his comments , but because of this possibility , asked Mr. ROBERTS , are you going to take away from . upright judges the right to guide a juror 's mind toward a just result ? In his opinion , that question answers itself . He was firmly ? of the belief that to take away from the judge the power to give help in reaching the correct decision in a difficult trial was simply to " cru " cify the administration of justice and make a mockery of it . " If Senator NORRIS of the Judiciary Committee and other Senators who , like him , wish to reduce Federal judges to the role of a mere automaton , as described by Mr. ROBERTS , had given their minds to these heretical views , they might have hesitated long before making their author an - Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States .          @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
