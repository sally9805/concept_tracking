The Erica Reed , sailing under the U. S. flag , manned by a U. S. crew , steamed last week into Barcelona Harbor carrying foodstuffs sent to Leftist Spain by U. S. friends and sympathizers . Lloyd 's of London reported that two Rightist armed patrol boats had signaled to the ship to stop four miles off Gibraltar . Instead , Captain Harry <P> Johnson ignored the signals , steamed unmolested up the Mediterranean Coast. * Dumped on the docks of the half-starved , refugee-jammed Catalan capital were 5,000 tons of wheat , enough to make 7,480,000 pound loaves of bread , bought from the U. S. Federal Surplus Commodities Corporation ; 28,540 Ibs. of powdered milk ( 500,000 glasses ) ; substantial quantities of canned meats and vegetables , rice and beans ; 400 bales of clothing ; 590,000 vitamin tablets , 100,000 quinine tablets , 100,000 aspirin , 26 Ibs. of nicotinic acid for pellagra victims . <P> Welcome as the cargo was , it was only a crumb in Leftist Spain 's empty dinner pail . The Erica Reed 's load was valued at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $12,000,000 worth of food was needed by Leftist Spain during the winter to prevent near starvation . <P> Barcelona censors have lately blue-penciled foreign correspondents ' realistic descriptions of the Leftists ' desperate food situation , but last week they allowed to pass over the cables a frank summing up of the famine by former Premier Diego Martinez Barrio . <P> Declaring that " it would be childish to try to hide the gravity of our situation , " Senor Martinez Barrio said Leftist Spain had 13,000,000 inhabitants . These are so woefully underfed , he continued , that infant mortality is " increasing at an extraordinary rate . " Although pleading for help , the former Premier defiantly denied that Leftist Spain would ever be brought to surrender through starvation : " There is something that Spain esteems more than bread . That is liberty and independence . ... Spain , hungry and naked or satisfied and clothed , places the prosecution of her war beyond the limitations of her necessities . " <P> Various correspondents in the U. S. on leave from Spain last week added : The army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Valencia , because Catalonia is rocky , industrial , grows mostly one crop of perishable vegetables . Valencia has three crops a year , grows rice and oranges in abundance . A ration card in Barcelona now entitles its holder to buy small amounts of dried lentils , corn meal , cabbage , turnips , one egg and 300 grams ( approximately eight small rolls ) of black " war " bread a week . Cats and dogs have virtually " disappeared . " Almost all livestock has been killed for food . There remains still some peasant hoarding of food . Last summer , for the first time , Leftist Spain 's vineyards began to show signs of neglect .
