Educators usually go to conventions to listen to educators , but last week 2,000 members of the New York State Vocational Association gathered in Manhattan to listen to businessmen . Their program was entitled : " The Employer Speaks to Vocational Teachers . " The convention proved to be unconventional . Most uncommon thing about it was a Mr. Jones , whose views on education , common to many a hardheaded businessman , shocked the 2,000 vocationalists . <P> Mr. Mark Jones , president of the Akron Belting Co. , likes to tell teachers what is wrong with U. S. education . His theme last week : let the nation 's educators dispel some costly national " illusions " ; to wit , equality , security , collective bargaining , economic planning , democracy . Said he : <P> " For more than 150 years the illusion of equality has served to delude the masses . . . . The idea that an individual as a matter of right and regardless of his qualifications should be able to participate in determining any and every question which may catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the term democracy for classification as an illusion . . . . <P> " Why did not the greatest educational system in all history equip the American people to detect these ancient fallacies ? . . . Why have so many educators been so easily persuaded to chase butterflies that will take all education as we have known it in America into oblivion ? . . . To conclude . . . I think there is a basis for hope . . .. I think it is in the idea of noblesse oblige . "
