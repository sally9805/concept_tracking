THEY say there is now one divorce for every six marriages in this country . Your first thought probably is : " What a let of free , selfish husbands ! " But did you ever pay . alimony ? I have for sixteen years . Most men know that to support a family means a If ? t of galling anxiety . I magine this , then : Before you spend a nickel on your own family , you must , on Ihe first i , 1 each month , send several hundred dollars to a woman who decided years ago that she did n't like yell , who put you out , who is good-looking , in bouncing health and childless , and who , moreover , has sonic property of her own , with the prospect of inheriting a great deal more . Imagine seeing your present wife , who deserves everything , overworking , scrimping , riding on street cars when her friends have their automobiles , berause you must send alimony to your divorced wife . Your divorced wife 's life meantime consists @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , breakfast in bed , a plush-lined sedan and long , contented afternoons in beauty shoppes . There are more beauty shoppes now than there used to be saloons . It is your money that finances this . But the worst of it is that she , of all people in the world , has a special dislike and ill will for you . Why ? Well , if you ask her she will say , with a look of dramatic self-pity , that she " gave six years of her life to you . " You might answer that , after all , those six years she gave were spent with you in one of the best apartments in town and at a time when you were younger , handsomer and more engaging I han yrou will ever be again . But that would n't do any good . It is funny how , sometimes , women can feel so abused . It is said that more than a million women receive alimony in this country . I know that the very large majority of them deserve it , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But I also know that justice to husbands in some ways is all unbalanced in this matter of alimony , particularly in New York State , by whose laws I urn at present seriously hog-tied . There are about two hundred thousand men paying alimony in New York State . Vested Interest in Prosperity W E ARE now in hard times . Now , when you take a salary cut or lose a job , it ispathetically easy to persuade the wife who lives with you and is fond of you to wear her seven-year-old fur coat again and to do the work of the furnace man . But you can not cut down on your divorced wife . The anomaly of the law is that a man must support his parents only when they are unable to work , but his divorced wife in any event ; that a woman , while married , is subject to the vicissitudes of her husband 's career , but when AT THE risk of being ungentlemanly , I want to 1 .. complain of some current alimony injustices . First , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was thirty I fell in love and married . I was at that time making eight thousand dollars a year . My wife had some property from which she received an income of about twenty-five hundred dollars a year . After six years of marriage , my wife became actively disinterested in me  --  that is to say , she liked another man better  --  which , I will not deny , probably made me overtly disagreeable as a husband . After a while we separated . After a long while I , too , wanted to marry somebody else . Now , this , as so often happens with childish women , made my wife , in a curious way , feel that she had been grievously wronged , and so she has felt ever since . I do n't know just why . She had been anxious to get rid of me for a long time . In our divorce , as is customary , I assumed the role of the guilty party . Though there were no children and my wife had some money , she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heartily as my wife or the judge or anybody else , for a husband always feels guilty in a divorce court . I was ordered to pay my wife either a lump sum of forty thousand dollars or , in lieu of that , the interest on it. , which was two hundred dollars a month , until that time when I could pay in full . I was in those days like Bothwell when he eloped with Mary Queen of Scots , " a. glorious , bold and hazardous young man . " And very proud . I was sure that I would soon have forty thousand dollars . I was certainly not going to be so paltry and bookkeeperish as to quibble over it . Well , I see now , after sixteen years , that I shall never have that forty thousand dollars . So this is my present status : I am married to my second wife , who is the most beautiful and kindest of women . We have three children who must go to college some day . There is the depression .. My business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have taken four salary cuts . I had some farm mortgages before the slump  --  but why go into that ? We still live in our house , a large , rather imposing one , but we now have only one little adenoidal maidservant who , it seems , suffers from bad colds that frequently keep her in bed and require trays of food , and my wife , for whom I would cut off my right hand if it would do any good , works like a charwoman ; more than sharing , of course , anxiety and apprehension and general gloom . In these days a man may look prosperous , but inside all is fear , debts , pressure . The nights are insomnia alternating with nightmares . People see your house , but not the mortgages on it , or the fact that if you can not serape together a few hundred dollars at a certain crucial moment , everything will go over the dam  --  house , business , everything . Your divorced wife comes back from Mexico one day , so you ask your lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She replies that you still belong to two clubs ; that does n't look like hard times to her . Now , clubs , as it happens , are an essential part . of my business overhead ; even so , I intend to resign as soon as the year for which I have paid dues has run out . But divorced wives are very suspicious . She refuses to take less alimony . " Two clubs ! " she laughs with a great deal of false geniality . Now , if I go to court and ask for a reduction in spite of her refusal , she will contest it . This will mean a short but nasty legal struggle . I will have to expose to the court my financial misery , which , I know , will do myself and my company a great deal of harm just now . Moreover , there will probably be publicity over it  --  small , peevish publicity  --  a thing that many divorced wives actually seem to relish , but which divorced husbands find unbearable . And there you are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who pay alimony . I know their stories , just as a knock-kneed woman knows every pair of knock-knees in town . A friend of mine is a prominent New York divorce lawyer  --  a tall , liver-colored , Latin-quoting , kind , facetious man . At the word " alimony " he always smiles in the guilty way that all lawyers dn , knowing so well what a rotten sell it can be , and that it is one in which they frequently take part . Where the Man is . filways Wrong H E CAN tell you stories by the hour of well-bred men who marry ill-bred actresses , and t he end of the story will be that the actress , after a few years of marriage , lives sumptuously alone on Park Avenue and is in possession of the man 's children and seven-eighths of his fortune . Now , all this is to be expected if you marry a tough girl %vhoni a hard life has made venal . But a man can run into almost equal adversity if he is divorced from a refined , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know such a girl . She divorced her first husband , with whom she had had three children , and married a young man whom I shall call Jack Smith . In remarrying , she forfeited some of her alimony , but . she still received three hundred dellars a month for the support of her three children . She and Jack Smith now have a child . His salary is the moderate one of a young insurance man ; but because of his wife 's ii alimony , it is possi.0 ble for them to live in a big white house with four green acres around it . They have three servants , two ears , four charming children . It is an outstandingly happy family . Now , I do n't be-grudge them their happiness . Far from it . I just want to point out the differ-* ence in the lot of this young woman 0 and that of the man she divorced . Ho can not afford to marry again . He is older than his wife and is now entering into the fifties ? those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is uncomfortable and difficult , and no fun for the children , because he cannot. afford a house or servants . He has to live in a downtown hotel . Now , even if he had been the worst sort of rake , there is injustice in this situation . As a matter of fact , he is not a rake at . all but a decent sort of fellow , and , like so many alimony-paying husbands , his good nature and patience under the circumstances are extraordinary . When I first met him I had no idea that he was the charming Mrs. Smith 's first . husband , and I happened to mention Jack Smith . " Oh , so you know Jack Smith ? " he said in a cheerful , conversational way . " Fine young fellow . " " Yes . Do you know Jack ? " I said . " Yes , indeed , " he said . " In fact. , he 's a sort of relative of mine  --  a relative by marriage . " Even among polite people , alimony is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law 's fault . It is because public opinion takes the attitude that all divorced men are guilty . In a divorce , men are so much more frightened than women , and though it is reprehensibly cowardly of them , they have reason to be . A divorce may botch their business or professional careers . The publicity is their horror . They may be dangled before the public ' in such a way i hat they will lose their jobs or their clients ur social standing . At least , that is their fear . Men know that in a divorce the man is always wrong . If a woman divorces her husband to marry somebody else , people think it is all very romantic and sad , and that her husband must . he perfectly horrid , while if he divorces her for almost any reason , they are dead sure he is horrid .

He batters except for a criminal offense , such as the fact that his children are in serious want . What is done then by childless Nvives is this : They wait . When the alimony owing them has accumulated and is a large sum , they sue him for it and take it away . The law 's attitude is that a man is obliged to support for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ divorce . And since he marries " for better or for worse , " his divorced wife shares in his prosperity throughout his life exactly as if she were still married to him .. That is why , if your divorced wife likes money very much , you always know that she has her binoculars out , and that if the graph of your income rises above the survival line , she may assemble the attorneys . If you grow poorer , she is also expected to share in that . But the trouble is , as I have already shown , that by the time a man desperately needs a reduction in alimony , he often has n't the money to go to court in order to get . it . And that fact , plus a. peculiarly spiteful woman , means that he goes to jail . .17 Survival of the Debtor ? Prison Now I want to tell about the fellows who go to jail . Alimony jail is a survival of the debtors ' prison , where a man was sent by his creditors and remained until @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not earn money in jail . In New York an alimony defaulter can be put in jail by his wife . The law of it is that he is guilty of contempt of court . If he owes his wife a sum under five hundred dollars , his jail term is three months ; if more than . that , it is six months . After he has served his term he is released . He gets a job if he can and begins paying alimony again , taking pains to pay off the arrears at . the same time , at the rate of a few dollars a week . But then , perhaps , he loses his job , or gets drunk in discouragement . His wife , if she happens to be revengeful or stupid , has him imprisoned itgain . I think this is too much power for an emotionally unstable woman to have . You will say , " Why does n't he hire a lawyer ? " Well , lawyers cost money , for one thing , and most alimony prisoners are men without money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not go to court and ask for a. reduction in alimony until all the arrears have been paid up . This alone will wipe out the contempt-of-court charge , the law maintaining that a man must come into court with clean hands before he can ask any favors of it . And how can a Le Sang about the body until the native 's compelled to lower his arms , and then  --  curtains ! A left and right to the jaw and the fight 's in the record books . Leaving the handlers I 'd hired to look after Hanophy , I crashes through the mob to where Annie is . She 's sunk in a chair , her head buried in her hands . At her feet is a crumpled piece of paper . " Good girl , " says I , and I puts my arm around her shoulders . They 're heaving . " What 's the matter ? " I asks . " It 's no use , " she sobs . " I 'm still Mike Alceloskey 's daughter . " man in and out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In the alimony jail in New York City there are always thirty or more prisoners . Each one costs the taxpayers twenty-five dollars a day . I went there once  --  out of a. sort of morbid sympathy , you might say  --  to see a once-rich young man who has been ruined by his wife . The jail is a grimy , blind-faced , stone building in West Thirty-seventh Street . you ring a doorbell . An enormous key grates in the lock and a shuffling old jailer lets you in . There is a musty , twilit office , cut off from the bleak corridors by iron gratings . Jail for a Conscientious Objector The alimony prisoner I visited was a debonair , but discouraged , black-haired young man . He had been married to a penniless girl . They had one child . At their divorce he gave her twenty-five thousand dollars outright and two hundred dollars a month for the support of the child . But she neglected the child and gave it to others to take care of , and spent the money on clothes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he discovered this , he with-. held some of this money and put it . in trust for his child . She went to court about it and he was ordered to continue his payments to her . " At that point , " he said to me , " I became a conscientious objector and would not pay , and went to jail . Then , after five months in jail , my business got so bad that I couldn't. pay if I had wanted to . Then the arrears began to pile up . Now , my wife likes money , but there is one thing she likes more  --  to have me in jail . Once when I was out for a couple of weeks , I borrowed a thousand dollars from a friend and offered it to her . But she would n't take it . I owed her a little more than that . So it was back to jail for me . " And now I am in a mean fix . My business is ruined . I doubt tha t I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Drive with twenty-seven thousand dollars ' worth of furniture  --  my furniture . She has two cars  --  my cars .

Joseph Sabath , of Chicago , who has the national record of more than thirty thousand divorce eases , and is very conscientious abou t foiling gold diggers .

For there is not one husband in five hundred , " says Judge Strong , " who is such a dangerous brute as to be unsafe to live with . " Where Men Have Equal Rights It seems to rIle that would be the bitterest pill of all  --  to pay alimony to a wife who will not live with you and yet . who will not divorce you : because she could have divorced you in the same trial where she got her separate maintenance , if she had wanted to , just by asking for a divorce ; for in most states the grounds for a divorce and for a legal separation are exactly t he same . But for her own reasons , she has preferred to stay married to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ preveni you from marrying somebody else , but the dyed-in-the-wool gold diggers . I am told , stay married to a man because it is a strategic bargaining pisiLion to be in . Nov , in a few Western states where women are becoming chivalrous and upstanding  --  that is , in Wisconsin , California. , Oregon and Washington  --  they have passed laws providing alimony for husbands . This has happened within the past ten years . The laws are not freak ones either , but sensible and flexible , so that the court eau consider all the circumstances of the case . There is even an instance or a judge who ordered a delinquent , wife to pay up her alimony or go to jail . I know , personally , half a dozen men who should have alimony . TO give just one example : A very rieli woman married a steady , decent , youngish man who made three thousand dollars a year . She badgered him  --  it took her several years  --  into giving up his job so that he could follow her to Palm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ buy her tickets , look after her country place , discharge her cooks . In other words , she soon turned him into the helpful subordinate that many wives are  --  not . that I do not feel sorry for them for that . But she was not very nice about . it Frequently she liked to tell him what a cad he was for living on her money , and because he was a conventional young man he agreed with her . He could not respect himself , and the less he respected himself the more he drank , and the more he drank the more she told him what a cad he was . Well , at . I he end of fifteen years she kicked him out , He had lost his self-esteem , fifteen years of his life , his job and his capacity fur work . Now , I think that that man deserved alimony as much as the wives of any of those millionaires you hear the women telling about , who discard the old wives of their poverty for new and young and beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of men . But if a judge , examining the grounds for her divorce , should order this woman to pay alimony , or at least to send her husband to a sanatorium for a few months , it might open her eyes to what she has done to him . At least she would not pity herself , as she does now , very acutely , for having been martyred by a worthless husl ) and . Men who actually get alimony are as rare as hens ' teet h . I have asked many lawyers if they knew of any . One leading divorce lawyer could tell of only one instance  --  a foreign prince whose rich American father-in-law bought him off with a large yearly alimony . Another divorce lawyer , who has had hundreds of cases , was so unfamiliar with the idea of alimony for men that he was almost shocked : " A man get alimony ? There is another name for that kind of fellow . You know what I mean . " Holdovers of Victorianism . Ti you pay alimony , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . it has not . I think the reason is that a carefree , well-endowed , single life soon seems preferable to marriage . " My alimony is five hundred dollars a month , " a very socia tile , divorced lady told me . " I can not afford to many and forfeit that But this is not a had life . No husband to inspect your You can do as you please . " " You can do as you please ! " It is frightening to see the look of envy in the eyes of harassed wives at these words . Even if your divorced wife marries again , do not think that your alimony to her automatieally ceases . The husband who assumes this to be so without taking legal steps soon finds himself in a pickle , for he can he forced at any future time , even after twenty years , to pay every cent in arrears . He should , therefore , the moment his wife marries , appear in court and ask that the alimony he revoked . It is not necessarily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cases the judge has denied such a plea . For example , if a Avife has obtained a divorce from a rich . man and later has married a poor one , a chivalrous judge may say the rich man must keep on paying ; the theory being that the woman , through no fault of her own , has been cheated out of expected luxury . Yes , when you are an alimony payer he careful of legal details . There has been a man in a Western jail for a long time whose wife , six years ago , sued him for a legal separation and was awarded temporary alimony . Two years later she begged to be allowed to return to him . He foolishly took her back without , legally protecting himself  --  that is , without taking pains legally to terminate their separation . Now , after having lived with him for three years , she has left him again and has sent him to jail for inability to pay alimony for those three years . In conclusion , I say again that most women who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no one believes more than I that most people in the world , men and women , are good and always much more decent than the law requires them to be . Actual gold diggers are probably pathological cases , and U.S rare as those men who abandon heir children . Just the same , I think that frequently our courts give alimony to young , able-bodied , childless women as sentimentally as if they were our Victorian grandmothers  --  namely , the uneducated mothers of enormous families , living in a world where women had no property  --  even a wife 's earnings belonged to her husband  --  and where women could not possibly earn a decent living , and where a divorce was as rare and horrifying as a murder . One small reform might be a provision that no alimony be awarded by a judge until a personal investigation of the financial condition of the couple had been made  --  that is , a judge should . have more than the wife 's affidavit . The other day a young lawyer in New York von a point . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a reduction in alimony , even though he was in arrears . " For it is unreasonable to expect a man to pay back alimony when ho can not pay present alimony , " he argued . This crumb of reform set all the alimony prisoners in the Thirty-seventh Street jail whooping and hurrahing . But I am afraid it does little for me and men in my particular fix . An Alimonyless Heroine The only thing that will do us any good is for a certain kind of very comfortable , suburban-minded woman to become a little . : more high-minded about taking life easy on alimony  --  those women have grown so used to doing nothing at the expense of men that to do otherwise seems extraordinary to them . For example , a feminist will get her name in headlines because she refuses alimony . You would think , from the blackness of the headlines and the stir they make among the aforesaid kind of women , that the feminist must have six children whom she intends to support herself . But reading down the column , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than her husband ; all of which shows that a woman turning down alimony , even when there is not the slightest reason . why she should take it , is still news to many people . One rely pleasant . lady I know , who would feel a towering indignation if her cook did not work fourteen hours a day for her meager wages , told me the other day how , at her divorce , she struck for a huge lump sum from her husband  --  a hard-working man who is only moderately prosperous  --  rather than for monthly payments , because she was secretly planning to marry another man immediately after her divorce , which marriage would cut off the monthly payments . She told this in a carefree , frolicsome way . She seems to be much respected by her circle of rather aspiring-minded lady friends . And yet , if there is anything in the world less self-respecting than this , I can not imagine it . I wish that lots of comfortably situated divorced women would come to see this sometime .
