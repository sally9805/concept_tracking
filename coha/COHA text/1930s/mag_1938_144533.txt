The drab , run-down streets of industrial Glasgow , Scotland 's largest city , were face-lifted with banners &; bunting last week as their Majesties , King George VI and his Scottish Queen , Elizabeth , arrived to open officially Glasgow 's $50,000,000 Empire Exhibition . Glasgow citizens , 50,000 of whom are still unemployed despite the Clydebank 's shipbuilding and rearmament boom , lined the streets and cheered lustily as the royal couple , riding in an open landau drawn by spanking Windsor greys , jogged out to the exhibition site , wooded Bellahouston Park . There in the neighboring Ibrox soccer stadium before 60,000 cheering Scots , King George acclaimed the exposition " a symbol of unity of the empire , the hallmark of this commonwealth of nations . " <P> Compared to the much-postponed Paris Exposition of last year , the Glasgow fair set a record by being 98% ready on opening day . By week 's end well over half a million visitors had entered the gates of the 175-acre park . Entirely a " family affair " designed to further British Empire trade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Home Country , the Dominions , various Crown colonies and two special halls showing off Scotland to the empire . <P> The arts exhibit features " the only representative collection of Scottish Old Masters ever assembled under one roof . " When a Scot commissioned such painters as Sir John Lavery , Sir David Cameron , Allan Ramsay or Alexander Eraser to do his portrait or a bit of native scenery , his heirs somehow managed to keep the picture in the family and few have had to be sold to buyers like Sir Joseph Duveen or Sotheby 's of London . The canny private owners were induced to loosen up and loan their paintings for this year 's display . <P> Most picturesque exhibit is a full-scale Highland clachan squat in the middle of the fair 's modernistic , pastel-shaded buildings . Like a Rob Roy setting , complete with the chief 's castle , a smithy , an old fashioned inn , a bubbling burn and a 1150-ft. loch , the little village is peopled with tartan-clad Highlanders who obligingly raise a " hooech " and a skirl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exhibition 's managers have been beset with protests since the fair was planned . Built in the midst of a Glasgow local option " dry " area , it took a special act of Parliament to insure thirsty Scots of a " wee deoch an ' doris " on the grounds . Strait-laced Scots , who are now righteously demanding that the grounds be closed on Sundays , last week objected to three classic statues of nude women . The canny Scottish exhibitors , not wishing to spoil the commercial attraction of the statues , temporarily solved the problem- they " clothed " the nudes by pasting pieces of paper on the glass screens in front of the statues .
