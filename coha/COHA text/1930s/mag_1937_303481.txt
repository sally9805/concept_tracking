A Star Is Born ( United Artists ) starts by making the point that one girl in a hundred thousand who go to Hollywood to be stars becomes one . It then examines the career of the exception-Esther Victoria Blodgett ( Janet Gaynor ) who , the day she arrives on the Coast , financed by her grandmother 's nest egg , tiptoes into the outer lobby of Grauman 's Chinese Theatre and stands tremulously in the cement footprints of her favorite actor , Norman Maine . From this point on , the story of A Star Is Born does not differ in superficial outline from the story that has been told a hundred times , usually as an excuse for weak screen musicals . <P> It does differ-as Esther Blodgett is supposed to differ from her competitors-in essentials . Trenchantly directed by William Wellman who , with Robert Carson , conceived the story from which Carson , Dorothy Parker and Alan Campbell wrote the screen play , handsomely photographed in the Technicolor which its producer , David Oliver Selznick , is pioneering with increasingly fortunate results , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ picture which , in the welter of verbiage about Hollywood heretofore contributed by stage and screen , stands as the last word and the best . <P> Not until , with three weeks rent due at her boardinghouse , she gets a job as waitress at a party given by Producer Oliver Niles ( Adolphe Menjou ) , does Esther encounter her hero in the flesh . By this time , like the rest of Hollywood , she is aware that Norman Maine ( Fredric March ) is an habitual drunkard whose dipsomaniac pranks are an intolerable nuisance or an aspect of his charm , depending on the point of view . To Esther , whom Maine accosts in the kitchen , escorts home and brings to the studio for a screen test , they are presumably the latter . To Niles and his glowering pressagent ( Lionel Stander ) , they are definitely the former . <P> Maine 's elopement with Esther , by this time rechristened Vicki Lester , is the prelude to an ecstatic honeymoon in a trailer . <P> When they get back to their Hollywood villa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pond , Maine learns that in her next picture his wife will play opposite Niles 's newest male star and that his own halcyon days in Hollywood are over . <P> The private tragedies of Hollywood cinemactors are something which the rest of the world , except possibly the readers of cinemagazines , can take in its stride . <P> It is precisely this point of view as contrasted with Norman Maine 's own evaluation of his decline and its effect on his wife that gives the latter portion of A Star Is Born its effectiveness . The drunken speech in which Maine betrays his jealousy when his wife gets an Academy Award ; his sojourn in a sanatorium to recover from the jitters ; his fist fight with Niles 's pressagent at Santa Anita race track , are related with superlative detachment . They lead up to the climactic scene in which sunset on the Pacific-a magnificent shot which is possibly the best individual justification of Technicolor yet seen on the screen-tempts Maine to an appropriately exhibitionistic suicide , leaving Esther to a Hollywood funeral in which an admirer steals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
