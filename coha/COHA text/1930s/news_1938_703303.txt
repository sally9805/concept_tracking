txt Reduction of the export rubber quota for the second half of this year is predicted by the Telegraaf here . The Telegraaf expects the International Rubber Regulation Committee , which holds its next meeting May 31 , to set the quota at 50%. which would compare with the 60% allowance prevailing in the current quarter and the 70% set for the first period this year . In the June quarter of 1937. the export quota was 80% . Because of the decline in rubber prices , the international committee had postponed quota action at its March meeting in London . ft declared it would await a settling of conditions and the formation of a better line on world supplies before fixing the export allowances for the third and fourth quarters . Conditions have not changed materially since March . but the committee probably will have to act at its meeting late next month .
