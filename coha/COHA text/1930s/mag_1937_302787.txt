Early each morning from a slinky Rolls-Royce that glides up to a dingy row of buildings on London 's Long Acre , there steps a sandy-haired , neat , London-born Jew , 67-year-old Julius Salter Elias , chairman and managing director of Odhams Press Ltd . He is the most diligent figure in Britain 's newspaper world . In his silver- &-black; modernistic office he works 16 hours on weekdays , eight on Sundays . Every night at 10 he telephones his press superintendent to get last-minute details of headlines , pictures , stories . Austerely aloof , this lone wolf of Fleet Street , who envies Press Barons Beaverbrook and Rothermere only their titles , seldom talks to them direct , receiving their messages through a lieutenant . <P> Elias is a manufacturing printer as well as a publisher , has one entire company devoted to the printing of outdoor advertising posters . Last week , while he lay ill of a gastric complaint in a nursing home , Fleet Street learned that Elias had outbid Beaverbrook and Rothermere , had bought for a reputed 600,000 cash @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over control of the cut-glass society weeklies Tatler , Bystander , Sphere , as well as the Illustrated London News , Illustrated Sporting &; Dramatic News and the monthly Britannia &; Eve . <P> Odhams lately built a new printing plant of Goss high-speed color gravure presses , as used by New York 's Dally News and Crowell Publishing Co . Undoubted reason for last week 's purchase was that Elias was planning something extra to print on these presses though he already prints some 100 periodicals in all fields-newspapers , medical papers , trade papers . His range of publications includes such variety as the Daily Herald , with a 2,000,000 circulation , Weekly Illustrated , Debrett ( Britain 's social register ) , The People , Passing Show , and John Bull . Editor-in-chief of every organ put out by Odhams is John Dunbar , a Scot with a rich brogue . Elias , who has never written a newspaper story in his life , is the firm 's financial spearhead . His wealth is impossible to gauge for he never publishes a financial statement . Odhams ranks so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ big bond issue last year is was oversubscribed in five minutes . <P> Fleet Street , which has long grown weary of Elias ' successes , was last week much more absorbed in a campaign to throttle " sensationalism , " launched by the National Union of Journalists containing some 6,100 newshawks , two-thirds of the total number in Britain . The Union sent strong protests to the Newspaper Proprietors ' Association ( representing national dailies and Sunday papers ) and the Newspaper Society ( representing 1,000 provincial papers ) . <P> By last week the issue had developed into a Parliamentary campaign . Among those urging the Government to impose some sort of censorship were a large number of M.P . ' s who feel that the Government , under the excuse of throttling ghoulishness , can control " indiscreet " ' news about the Royal Family and other public figures .
