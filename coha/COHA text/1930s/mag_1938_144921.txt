To fortify his soul he attended evening services at the Reno Baptist Church . <P> When Ed Collins came out of church his two pals were waiting for him . They took him to a lumber yard , made him steal two stout boards . Then they drove him to the edge of town , to a lonely spot near the County Hospital . <P> " If you want to be a little Jesus Christ , " they said , " we 'll make one out of you . " <P> With the two boards they made cross . With tenpenny nails through his hands &; feet , they crucified Ed Collins . His screams brought help in time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ names .
