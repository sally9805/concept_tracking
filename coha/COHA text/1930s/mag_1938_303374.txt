The U. S. Army freight transport Meigs zigzagged all night in a light rain , sending up flares and fingering the dark water with her searchlights . Late the next afternoon , 400 miles east of San Bernardino Strait in the Philippines , she came upon a vast patch of gasoline and oil , like rainbow-tinted gossamer rising and falling on the Pacific swells . She radioed her discovery to Manila . Airmen guessed that under the oil patch , in 5,000 fathoms , were 15 dead men and a handsome $450,000 airplane , the Hawaii Clipper . <P> The Clipper could have dropped the oil to smooth the sea for an emergency landing , then drifted off out of sight of the Meigs . But at the end of the week , though army bombers and navy destroyers and submarines kept up the weary search , the subject in the minds of most airmen was closed . The Clipper was a 26-ton Martin 130 , built for Pan American 's transpacific route in 1935 . Trim and seaworthy , she could ride out rough weather as easily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She carried rubber inflatable boats , a stock of small balloons to drop behind her in hare-hounds fashion to show her course , kites for an emergency radio aerial , a shotgun and fishing tackle in case she piled up on a coral reef , enough food for 15 people for a month . But not all the gadgets in the world could save her if she smacked the water hard enough to crack her seagoing hull-or if she caught fire while dumping gasoline , as the Samoan Clipper , with Captain Musick and a crew of six , did last January off Samoa . <P> Pan American officials , hard put to it to explain their first loss of passengers in nearly two years of transpacific flying , did not think the Clipper had caught fire . After last January they had changed the design of the gasoline dump valves . What had happened they did not know . The Hearst press suggested that since one of the passengers , a Jersey City , N. J. restaurant owner named Wah Sun Choy , was carrying money to China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigator from the Bureau of Air Commerce started from Washington , with little hope of discovering anything . Meanwhile , the Hawaii Clipper ' ? , sister ships , the China Clipper and the Philippine Clipper , coolly flew their scheduled routes , passing each other in mid-Pacific.
