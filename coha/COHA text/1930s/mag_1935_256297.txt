Now add up your columns and prepare to make an immediate choice of two alternatives : <P> 1 ) To be totally annihilated . <P> 2 ) To begin your life over again , live it up to the present exactly as it was lived before , without profiting by any experience of the first life . <P> Confronted with this dilemma , most adults would choose annihilation-according to Dr. Knight Dunlap , distinguished Johns Hopkins psychologist . Somewhat dubious of this conclusion was one of Dr. Dunlap 's distinguished colleagues , Dr. Frederic Lyman Wells of Harvard Medical School , head psychologist of Boston Psychopathic Hospital .

In Science last week Dr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voted for annihilation . <P> This average held for Dr. Wells 's largest and most important group , 121 subjects chosen for high intelligence among the hospital and university personnel , almost all between 20 and 40 years old . Of these only 20 voted against repeating their lives . A bevy of student nurses showed even stronger repugnance to annihilation , only four out of 32 voting for it .
