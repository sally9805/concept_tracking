Washington Henry Ochsner , a Swiss-born oil geologist , died in 1927 at 47 in a Portland , Ore . hotel , alone and virtually penniless . Behind he left a widow , two former wives , three children , a host of disgruntled backers and oil royalty rights on 2,538 gullied , sun-scorched acres in California 's Kettleman hills . The year after Ochsner died , pay sands were struck in those hills , opening up one of the country 's major oil pools . From the Ochsner acres nearly $1,000,000 of royalties have already accumulated , and estimates of the eventual total run as high as $10,000,000 . Yet until last week no one had ever received a penny of these Ochsner royalties because they had been impounded by the courts pending settlement of the mos labyrinthine litigation in California his tory . <P> Even before Ochsner died the legal battle had begun in a desultory skirmish the luckless geologist having been given to vague , if not sly , business methods Somewhat the same methods also seemed to have carried over into his marital relations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wisconsin in 1903 he elopec with a nurse named Frances Anna Strasilipka , a Bohemian shoemaker 's daughter whom he deserted five months later , leaving her with child , which died at birth That was the last Wife No. i ever heard of Washington Henry Ochsner until someone sent her a clipping reporting his death Meantime Ochsner got a divorce in Goldfield , Nev. , later married one Lena Jessie Nelson , who for no apparent reason became known as Nancy . They had two children , were divorced in 1925 . Wife No. 2 married a man named Warren E. Baldy of Carson City , Nev. , and restless Mr. Ochsner went on to Wife No. 3 , Miss Hilda Carling , who bore him one son and remarried a onetime Chicago capitalist named Francis William Hinckley after Ochsner 's death . <P> At the dazzling signal from Kettleman hills , all three women rushed for the courts . Wife No. 3 asked that a worthless property settlement be set aside , claiming her husband died intestate . Wife No. 2 suddenly produced a will which she claimed left @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 1 , to lay down what looked like the ace . She never knew that she had been divorced . On the ground that papers were never served , she had the Goldfield decree vacated . In the eyes of Nevada law , Wife No. 2 and Wife No. 3 had never been wives at all . <P> To establish this contention in California was another matter . Moreover , the embattled wives by this time were being flanked by an outsider . It looked as if the entire kitty might be snatched by one of Ochsner 's old partners , Frank C. ( " Pat " ) Daugherty , a big , breezy Pasadena oilman who had been properly done in by the vague geologist . <P> Pat Daugherty was by no means the only outsider who laid claim to the Kettleman Kitty . As far back as 1910 Ochsner had been wildcatting on the public domain around Kettleman . Ghosts from this early period arose in the courts by droves . Some 50 people from around Fresno , Calif. , known as the Morrow Group , sued for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ claims . Another roup on the same ground asked for 20% . An Ochsner wildcatting promotion called Medallion Oil Co. , which lost $100,000 for number of Wall Streeters including Bernard Mannes ( " Barney " ) Baruch , sued not only for the royalties but the entire lease , pipe , well and derrick.
