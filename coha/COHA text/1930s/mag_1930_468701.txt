E MUST all hang together or assuredly we shall hang separately . " Benjamin Franklin signing - his name to the Declaration of Independence reduced to a sentence the working philosophy of every bunch of highwaymen and bank burglars . " If one slips we all fall , " they say , and build their code upon the cornerstone of loyalty . In great crises the written law has always gone down before the unwritten . In flood , panic , earthquake , plague , human need abrogates all law . The necessity to survive dictates a new code ? or a return to the oldest of codes . There is no time for fine distinctions . In the San Francisco earthquake and fire the community recognized but one fundamental law , the need to survive . They reverted to a simple primitive code . In the criminal world every man lives always on the edge of catastrophe . Danger is the norm . Once having put himself into conflict with society , society 's rules cease to exist for him . He swiftly recognizes that his life and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get loyalty he must give it . Often it is his only virtue . If he has n't it he perishes ? by one law or another . The criminal 's code is based upon the same fundamentals as the social code : protection of life and property . Though the underworld code recognizes no obligation to the upperworld , within the limits of its own world it is absolutely inexorable . It pays its debts and its grudges on the minute . The crook , likethe business man , strengthens his position and credit if be meets his bills and discharges his obligations promptly . It 's in the book that the crook pays his room rent and his board , and it 's the part of safety to do so . The unpaid landlady may bring down the police , and the police may ask questions which will involve him and his friends . But also , to fail to pay the board bill is an admission that he is a " slow connecter " ; he ca n't make the grade . In other words , he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dead-beat . Sooner or later he winds up where he belongs , stealing milk bottles and doormats , serving short sentences in small jails , despised by honest people and shunned by " honest " thieves . The upperworld knows nothing about caste as compared with the underworld . Crookdom is the most provincial of small villages , the most rigid in its social gradations . Honors and opportunity are apportioned on the basis of code observance . There is no more caste in the heart of India than in an American penitentiary . A bank burglar assumes an air with a house burglar , a house burglar sneers at a pickpocket , a pickpocket calls the forger " a short story writer , " and they all make common cause against the stool-pigeon , whatever caste he comes from . He jeopardizes the life and liberty of his own , which is the great unpardonable crime in the underworld code . He is the rattlesnake of the underworld , and they kill him on the " safety-first " principle as swiftly and dispassionately as you would kill a copperhead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for property in the underworld is as deep as it is in the upperworld . The fact that it is upperworld property which is involved makes no difference , for when property is transferred from the upper-world to the underworld it becomes sacred again . The burglar who shoots his partner for holding out a lady 's watch goes up in the social scale of the underworld . Like the clubman who perjures himself to save a lady 's reputation , he has done the right thing in the sight of his fellows . Each is a better gentleman according to the code . The crook has one yardstick for measuring the conduct of the upper-world , another for the underworld . If his attorney strips him of his loot , as frequently happens , he is supposed to whistle it off and take it out on the next citizen he meets . The attorney belongs to the upperworld , and the crook 's obligation ends when he exposes him to his fellow-crooks . But if a thief 's partner robs him of his end of the loot he must " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caste . A thief chooses his working partners more carefully than does a business man because his life and liberty are at stake . A careful business man eliminates risky associates , and a careful burglar does the same thing ? in his own way . I knew a safe-breaker who " eliminated " his partner because he fell asleep on the job . While he was inside doing the " blacksinithing " on the bank vault , his outside man , his lookout , opened up the next-door saloon , got himself a bottle of whiskey , drank it , and went to sleep in a hallway . When the preliminary work was done the " blacksmith " came out to make sure it was safe to explode the dynamite , and discovered his helper legless drunk . He made a swift survey of the street , went in and finished his job , then returned and finished the man who had staked their life and liberty against a bottle of rum . If his reputation had not been unimpeachable according to underworld standards , his critics would have saidthat @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Instead they declared unanimously that it was " a proper payoff . " They knew him for a man who dealt the game of violence but would n't weaken if it were dealt to him . His end was appropriate . Disabled in a police battle , while trying to cover the retreat of his companions , he used his last cartridge on himself . The code makes heavy demands on those who believe in it . The hardest year I ever put in in prison was the one in which I saw an innocent man going slowly to the gallows when one word from me would have saved him . It was the one word which , according to the code , I could not speak . I knew the guilty man and all the circumstances surrounding the crime . It was knowledge that had been confided to me . In prison I came to know the accused man . He was not of the underworld but just a helpless victim in the mesh of circumstance . As I came to know him and realized how much finer he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tell him the truth and shout it from the housetops . But I was of the underworld , and all that I had in that world was my " good name " as a thief , built up by years of playing the game in strict accordance with the code . That was to me what a business man 's credit is to him . To sacrifice it was to become an underworld bankrupt . When one who is already a defaulter from society goes broke in the underworld he is like a half-breed Chinaman ? there is no place for him . Within the limits of the code I made all the gestures possible . I did everything except name the guilty man , but to no purpose . I saw this innocent man go to trial , saw him convicted , sentenced , and taken away to the death house . When , three days before the date set for his execution , the governor commuted his sentence to life imprisonment , I was almost as happy as he was . After I got free I spent considerable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his lawyer spent five thousand dollars of his own money , in an effort to free him . When we finally got him out his health was wrecked , and to compensate for ten years in San Quentin 's jute mill , he had just ninety days of sunshine before he died . According to the code the professional thief is supposed to take the tough breaks smiling , and the hard loser is no more popular in the underworld than in the upperworld . The gambler does n't tear his hair when he loses his bank-roll , and the carpenter who falls off a scaffold and breaks a leg takes it all in the day 's work . So the thief is expected to take with a smile even the grimmest jokes that justice plays on him . The most companionable cell-mate I ever had was a man serving five years for a crime he did n't commit . He had committed plenty of others for which he had n't served any time and he chuckled at the vagaries of justice all through his term . He was the renegade @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a house burglar . He was first arrested in a pawnshop disposing of stolen property ; but at the trial his mother , an aristocratic old lady with gray hair , and his beautiful sister perjured themselves up to the hilt to provide an alibi which won him an immediate acquittal . Three months later he was arrested again on suspicion of another burglary and identified by a ten-year-old child who saw him leaving the house . The same lawyer defended him , and once more his relatives alibied him to the satisfaction of a second jury , and he was again acquitted . One midnight a week later be was on his way to mil on a friend in a cheap hotel . As be passed through the hall there was a commotion in one of the rooms . The door was thrown open , and a man dashed past him and down the front stairs . The occupant of the room cried " Burglars ! Burglars ! " then blew a police whistle . Our burglar realized that it was a police case and this was no place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up the alley , and into the arms of a policeman who was answering thewhistle . The policeman found a skeleton key in his pocket which fitted the lock on the door of the burglarized room and the occupant said , " He looks very much like the man . " The same lawyer rallied to his defense , but this time no alibi was possible ; and the jury found him guilty without leaving their seats . The veteran lawyer turned to his young client and smiled grimly , " Well , Billy , they 're wrong again . " II The more strictly a criminal adheres to the underworld code the greater will be his handicap if , and when , he decides to mend his ways . This adherence makes him friends , and he is proud of it ; but these very friends help to anchor him in that life . The upperworld does not realize how great a part this plays in the lapses of offenders who are given an opportunity to reform . The backslider is charged with ingratitude , weakness , or deceitfulness . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prison in his suit of bull's-wool , and squeaky shoes , he packs a heavy load of obligations . He does n't realize it himself . The man who goes out of prison leaving no friends has fewer debts to the underworld , but he is likely to have fewer assets in the - upperworld ; for whatever kept him from making friends in one place will operate against him in another . If a man could throw off the implications of the code along with his prison . uniform , the road back would n't be so rough . My most difficult problem has been to survive in the upperworld and pay the underworld debts that had accumulated in twenty-five years , without running afoul of the police . The police never regard an ex-convict as reformed until he is ready to empty himself of all his underworld information . The sad part of it is that so many ex-prisoners do just this . It has always seemed to me that any man , whether he is in the upperworld or the underworld , must meet the obligaA BURGLAR LOOKS AT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ former associates had a right to expect and demand help from me , and of course they did demand it . In the fifteen years that I have been playing Society 's game , I have many times had one foot in a jail as the result of trying to reconcile the underworld and upperworld codes , Coward that I am , I ca n't help being glad of a continent between me and San Quentin where the prison population includes many men who have a right to ask me for help of a kind I can not give without jeopardizing my liberty and violating the law . I have been asked to send pistols and explosives and narcotics into jails by men who had a right to demand them because they had done favors for me in the past . Fortunately I had influential friends in the upperworld who understood both codes and helped me to pay my debts in a legitimate way . The man who wanted a pistol was given a chance instead at parole or probation ? a chance to make good in the upper-world . Instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me when I was locked up , my friends sent him to a hospital where he could take the cure . Some of my debts have had to be paid in kind , and no one could help me . I owe my life to a thief who risked his life to take me out of jail . He smuggled me saws to open my cell , then came in the night to cut the bars of the window and lifted me out through the hole when I was so weak from tuberculosis that I could barely walk . He sheltered me and fed me and finally sent me away where I was safe and free to get well . Years afterward , when I had cured myself of the dope habit , served my sentence , and won immunity from the law , and was just beginning to feel a little secure in my respectability , my telephone rang in the small hours of the night . A woman 's voice asked if I was " Mr. Black " and said , " I have a message from Eddie and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I ca n't give it over the ' phone . " I knew a dozen Eddies . I ranthem all through my mind . " You do n't mean Eddie who took me out . . . " " Yes , yes , " she interrupted . " Hurry . " I did n't know what had happened but I realized that another debt was due . She gave me an address . Fifteen minutes later I found myself in a shabby , light-house keeping room with the man who had taken me out of jail a bundle of bloody rags , lying desperately wounded on the dirty carpet . He needed medical attention and money , but more than that , he needed to be shielded from the police . What did I do ? What would you have done ? Could I turn my back on him and walk away to my secure , respectable position ? I could n't and did n't . He was hidden , nursed back to health , and sent away to safety . I have always felt that I owed frankness to my respectable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them informed of every contact I had with the underworld . None of them offered a word of criticism . Twice , on other occasions , I was taken to detective headquarters and accused of aiding fugitives and helping friends to keep ahead of the police . The Captain of Detectives solemnly read me the law from his code which declares : " It is a crime to conceal a crime . " I had probably read his code oftener than he had , but he knew nothing of the other code . I denied the particular accusations against me but told him that I could see myself doing those things under certain circumstances . After seven years of fairly clean living and honest work , I was indicted over-night by a San Francisco Grand Jury . The police and the district attorney 's office accused me of " flagrant obstruction of justice . " They produced my police record , which was as long as a widow 's clothes line , and not quite so clean , but neglected to include anything from the later pages of my life . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ term in prison , Fremont Older the editor , my employer and chief sponsor , and many other professional men and women who knew more about my activities than the police did , protested so vigorously that I was given a hearing by the Grand Jury . I told them nothing but the truth . I admitted a technical violation of the penal code but pleaded in extenuation that , according to the obligations incurred under another code , I could not have done otherwise . As a result the indictment was not " handed up " and one of the Grand Jurors afterward said , " We did n't have the heart to put you in jail for paying your debts . " Many ex-prisoners who try to go straight become involved with the law in an effort to discharge their obligations . The underworld is always reaching out to them , and the more help they are in a position to give , the greater the demands upon them will be . To one who understands underworld people , some of the causes that put them where they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , and to one who has been helped by them in thousands of ways , the letter of this code is almost mandatory . Few ex-prisoners have been so fortunate in the understanding of their upper-world friends as I have been and most of them would have landed in prison again for doing less in payment of their debts than I have done . III The evolution of my own attitude on law and code may have some significance for other people . Up to the age of fifteen , I believed in and followed the spirit and the letter of the law . Once having come into conflict with the police , my views changed over-night . When I found the first policeman wrong and the first crook right , I jumped to a boyish conclusion that all policemen were wrong and all crooks right . That was my first hook-up with the underworld , and thereafter for twenty-five years I sounded all its depths and shoals . I accepted the underworld code as unquestioningly as I had accepted the law . I operated underthe delusion that it was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reluctant struggle . After fifteen years of operating , or groping , under the written law , I have come to the conclusion that if it is n't entirely wrong , it 's far from being all right . Judged pragmatically it 's a wash-out . It does n't work . Basically , law is the expression of the people 's desire to get along together . It 's a short-cut to fair dealing among members of society . Unfortunately , it has got off its noble base . It has become complicated , perverted , prostituted . Special legislation has made of it a cloak for all kinds of high-roguery . Specialized enforcement that penalizes one man and lets another brush by for a like offense has brought it into disrepute . Every unenforced law brings all law into contempt . The non-enforcement of a constitutional amendment affecting the whole people may destroy a nation 's allegiance to the whole legal fabric . The rule-makers for all games except the game of life are continually trying to simplify the rules . If the rules governing baseball were as complicated as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rival " Jarndyce vs . Jarndyce . " Laws make lawyers and lawyers make laws , and this makes a sinister circle that grows larger and larger . The fewer and simpler laws a country has , the more apt they are to be obeyed . If there are too many of them people begin by ignoring the pesky little ones and end by questioning them all . Prohibition and automobiles have brought hundreds of thousands of people into conflict with the law and its tactless or corrupt enforcers who have never been involved before . Many a man who has been locked up over-night for a violation of a petty ordinance would not convict a burglar the next day if he were called on the jury . His first glimpse of the legal machine has made a rebel of him . The backsliding of the habitual criminals who are going the rounds of the penitentiaries is of small consequence because they are a small minority . There are fewer habitual criminals in prison to-day in proportion to the prison population than ever . It is a new type of offender @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no longer a sharp line of demarcation between the upperworld and the underworld . The deadline has been obliterated . Instead there is a growing , nebulous , shadowy anyman 's land , populated by men and women who pay allegiance to no code ? no law . It is this group that is congesting the court calendar until the district attorney 's office is so crowded that he puts a premium on a plea of guilty from the petty burglars and highwaymen to get them out of the way . He needs the time to prosecute indicted judges , politicians , bank examiners , bank presidents , cashiers , tellers , and messengers ; doctors , lawyers , druggists , and ambulance chasers ; crooked brokers and bucket shoppers , and the multitude of other offenders who are the by-product of bootleg . " Get yours and get it quick " was once a thieves ' notion . Now it seems to have spread to all walks of life . The legitimate ways of " getting it quick " are very limited , and more and more people seem to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ repudiated the law but still wear the cloak of Bradstreet are stimulating the crime wave and profiting by it . Jimmy Hope , the most famous bank burglar of fifty years ago , took a million dollars in bonds out of a Boston bank and could n't market them . The law meant something then . Jimmy dickered and haggled with Mother Mendelbaum , the fence , in her dingy dive , but she would have none of them . To-day he could step into a luxurious office and meet a man behind a polished desk who would grubstake him to pull off the burglary and take the bonds off his hands at fifty cents on the dollar the morning after . More and more brains are going into the underworld ? seeping through from the borderland group . Brains register anywhere you find them , and as the percentage of morons in the criminal world decreases , the problem of crime prevention and detection becomes more difficult and complicated . This change is so marked that it has led Russel A. Algire , vice-president of the National Surety Company , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ combat brains instead of nature . " The crack of the gunman 's pistol is nowadays only an echo from the higher ramparts of graft and corruption . When the bank president smashes his bank from the inside , and the State bank-examiner , chief-of-police of the banking world , turns " outside " man for him , to cover his looting , it 's not surprising that the small-salaried clerk goes wrong . Rather is it surprising that so many go right . After reading the criminal news in any issue of a New York daily , it is a simple matter for a pay-roll stick-up to rationalize his activities . As a retired highwayman , I can understand how a highwayman becomes what he is , but this growing body of higher-larcenists defies any analysis from me . Lawless ? and codeless ? they seem to me to constitute a greater menace to the established order than the journeymen highwaymen and pay-roll stick-ups who are circulating through space with their big pistols . When death comes the underworld turns its face to the wall and dies mute . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter how treacherously he is dealt with , almost invariably refuses to name his killer . He so hates the law , and the brass buttons and stars which to him are its symbol , that even in death he wo n't " turn copper . " And when the man from the district attorney 's office , with pad and paper in hand , prepares to take his dying statement , he most frequently gasps , " Get to hell out of here ! " The borderland criminal , who has neither suffered at the hands of the law nor accepted the code , often dies differently . X was a brilliant and successful criminal lawyer and one of the crookedest men that ever flourished in any profession . He boasted that he could put a man in prison or take him out , according to the way the money lay , and proved it on numerous occasions . He was hated and feared by the bench and the bar because he repeatedly doubled-crossed them both ; and no victim ever got out of his clutches with a. nickel in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pitcher to the well once too often . He was shot to death in his office by a man whose legacy be had stolen and whose family was on the verge of poverty . Under his stiffening hand was a blood-soaked scrap of paper which bore the line , " Clancy shot me . " IV The strength of the underworld code , bad and bloody as it is , lies in the fact that crooks believe in it absolutely and enforce it impartially . The evil of that code lies in the fact that it is very special legislation , by which a few , a very few , survive and thrive at the expense of the many . In contrast we find the legal code breaking down because the people are without faith in it . Why have they lost faith ? First , because the legal code is devious , complicated , slow-moving , and unnecessarily interfering , instead of being direct , simple , and swift . This leads to " racketeering , " which is an unconscious attempt to get back to direct dealing between people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ People submit to racketeering as a direct short-cut because they are worn down by the circumlocution involved in getting the necessities through legitimate , legalized channels . In the modern city few things can be accomplished honestly and legitimately and at the same time quickly . When a thoroughly competent automobile driver has wasted six mornings waiting to pass a driving test , he'srather susceptible to the suggestion of the bystander who says , " Co over and see Pete ? over there by the radiator . Slip him a couple of dollars . He 'll fix you up . " So we end by all " fixing one another up " ? extra-legally . Second . Many people have lost faith in the law because it is not impartially written or impartially interpreted . Too much of it is written by and for special groups no more entitled to special legislation than is the underworld to its narrow code . Third . Many people have lost faith in the law because they have lost faith in its administrators . The weakness , the partiality , the corruption of too many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to look upon the judge and the policeman as oppressors rather than protectors . The police-experience of one black sheep will often turn his respectable family and his neighbors against the law and line them up on the side of the code . I knew a woman in San Francisco who had never done a dishonest thing in her life Her boy was locked up and given the third degree and a beating , in an effort to get a confession from him . Failing , the police sent for his mother and offered her her son 's freedom if she would persuade him to give up the names of his companions . In a voice that the whole jail could hear , she said , " You keep your mouth shut , Joe . If you turn policeman and give them one name , I 'll disown you and discharge your lawyer , and you 'll not get another bite of food from me so long as you 're here . " Joe kept his mouth shut and shared his home-baked pies with the rest of us . The code @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather have seen her son in prison than a stool pigeon lined up with the police . Every time a judge swings the legal blackjack , he ties the underworld tighter to its own code . I have seen two thousand men in prison embittered by a single decision . " Woodenface Jimmy was serving two ten-year sentences in Folsom . He claimed that one of the sentences was invalid , and the prison " lawyers " after thrashing the case out pro and con decided that he was right . Jimmy saved every nickel he could beg , borrow , or steal , and when his first ten years were served the prisoners took up a collection and got him a lawyer . On a writ of habeas corpus the lawyer took him back to the up-state county seat where he had been sentenced . A new judge on the bench heard the writ and after much deliberation decided that Jimmy was right , that one of the sentences was invalid , but -- he had already served that sentence and he must now return to prison and serve the valid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without more money , and Jimmy II could never get another hundred dollars together , so he went back to prison and did the second ten years . In America the law is on trial , and its case is weak because it does not come into court with clean hands . Between the underworld crooks and their upper-world competitors , American lawlessness has become an international joke . And with all the unenforced laws on the statute books , lobbyists ? and legislators ? are spinning more laws to breed more contempt for all law . Americans are so inoculated with law that they are coming to feel themselves immune from all law . When this noble rage for legislation ? and lawlessness ? has passed , a period of sanity may set in out of which we can hope for the emergence of a new ethic upon which to build a better code : a code which will not permit one group to thrive at the expense of another but will deal out the widest justice to the most people . Some such code , at once simple and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table ? and be equally respectable and enforceable.
