txt In the heart of the east side there is to rise a block of model tenements which will stand comparison with modern housing in some of the best residential quarters . So much is apparent from the architects ' plans and drawings for the Lehman-Rabinowitz development on the old Hoe property undertaken on the limiteddividend basis . Coverage of only 50 per cent of the plot , spacious garden courts , elevators , direct lighting for every room , cross ventilation for every apartment , a community ballroom , library and day nursery , perhaps even a swimming pool in the cellar ! By next year 250 east side families will be domiciled under conditions that are nothing short of revolutionary for the neighborhood . We may be witnessing the first step toward the rejuvenation of the lower east side . Among the higher things to which poor neighborhoods are rising is higher rent . Apart from a cooperative selling plan of $500 a room , estimated rentals per room in the latest project are about $12 a month . This is certainly not excessive for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " only when compared with the rentals one still sees quoted as the necessary maximum for model housing for the poor . Yet by this time the public should have been educated to the utter impossibility of sanitary housing at $5 a room , short of charitable endowment . It is even questionable whether the $9 a room suggested in connection with the projected housing on Chrystie Street under municipal auspices can be realized . The $12 rate seems to be the minimum deducible from Mr. Rockefeller 's experiments in Harlem , the Amalgamated Clothing Workers ' cooperative apartments at Van Cortlandt Park , and now the east side estimates . That model housing is not available for the poorest tenement dwellers by no means condemns the enterprise . Many people somewhat above the minimum income level are entitled to the best housing they can get for rents they can afford . The usefulness of any single improvement extends far beyond the number of families directly accommodated . It tends to raise the level Of an entire neighborhood by the infection of example . It is for the architects to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it . Workingmen 's families with an aver-. age monthly income between $ , 100 and $125 can not pay $12 a room . The question may perefore be raised whether the promoters and planners of new housing have not been too ambitious . The model tenements , from the practical point of view ; are too model . There ought to be some middle ground between the old dumbbell rookeries east of Allen Street or west of Ninth Avenue and Park Avenue standards . ? Garden courts , communal libraries , swimming pools , electric refrigeration , are not gssentia/ . If costs can be reduced by building on 60 per cent of the plot instead of only 50 per cent , it is worth thinking about . Any economy that pushes acceptable sanitary housing a dollar a month a room downward to the average of $8 a month which the poor can afford deserves consideration .
