Stevedore ( by Paul Peters &; George Sklar ; Theatre Union , producer ) . It is an ironical fact that propaganda is always most enthusiastically received where it accomplishes the least . Stevedore , a drama of Negro peonage in the South , will certainly never be produced in New Orleans , on the docks of which its scene is laid . But it may deservedly run for months in the Civic Repertory Theatre on Manhattan 's 14th Street , with febrile audiences largely recruited from the neighborhood . Union Square , centre of racial tolerance , is little more than a tear gas bomb 's throw away . <P> The stevedore of Stevedore is a big taffy-colored buck named Lonnie ( Jack Carter ) . A white woman has a row with her burly lover which ends by his choking her and knocking her down . Her hysterical screams bring a crowd . Unwilling to implicate her lover , she babbles that a Negro attacked her . Among the colored folk arrested for questioning is Lonnie . Unlike the other dejected crows in the lineup , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cap'n . . . . Nawssuh. cap'n . . . . Dat 's right , cap'n . . . . " He has been helping a white labor organizer recruit a stevedores ' union on the Stuyvesant Docks . He stubbornly stands for his rights , makes a bad impression at the police station . <P> Released , Lonnie instantly butts his kinky head into more trouble by complaining to Mr. Walcott , head of Oceanic Stevedore Co. , that he and the other Negroes have been given short pay . Gruff Mr. Walcott ( grizzled Dodson Mitchell , who last played in the 14th Street theatre during the Blizzard of ' 88 ) strikes him for his impudence , tells him that he is " a bad nigger . " <P> " You mean , " Lonnie says slowly , " I is a nigger you cai n't cheat . " <P> That seals Lonnie 's doom . <P> The rape story is revived , feeling on the waterfront runs high . Lonnie is again arrested , escapes just before he is lynched . His flight fills four scenes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes more intense , its shabby cloak of propaganda happily falls away . Stevedore turns into a glorious melodrama in the grand manner of The Three Musketeers and The Count of Monte Cristo . As a finale , the Negroes defend their homes from a white-trash mob led by a red-headed bully named Mitch , as lively a scene as ever came from the pages of Hugo or Dumas . When the white stevedores rush to the aid of the besieged blacks , the play 's strictly partisan audience found itself cheering not for the symbolism of a workers ' united front , but simply for a thrilling rescue .
