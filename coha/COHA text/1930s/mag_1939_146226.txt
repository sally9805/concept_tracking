" Moral Re-Armament is magnificent and magnetic . It must be universal and unanimous . " - Richards Vidmer , New York Herald Tribune . <P> Thus read a blurb on a leaflet distributed last week in Manhattan . The leaflet was designed to publicize MRA Week , which ended on Sunday with a big Citizens ' Meeting in Madison Square Garden . On its face , the blurb looked like an endorsement of the doctrines of Dr. Frank Nathan Daniel Buchman , which in Europe have borne the label MRA since last summer ( TIME , Sept. 19 ) . <P> Actually " Dick " Vidmer , Herald Tribune sportswriter , had reported how 34 U. S. sportsmen* signed a statement : " Moral Re-Armament is a battle for peace where sportsmen must take the lead . . . . Sportsmen morally rearmed can unite the world . " They signed at the urging of handsome Henry Wilfred ( " Bunny " ) Austin , British Davis Cup tennis player , now Dr. Buchmairs chief MRA-sayer . Sportswriter Vidmer thereupon remarked that , before preaching such doctrines . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He concluded : " Moral rearmament , as it is described by the disciples who have brought it to these shores , is magnificent and magnetic , but it also is a mammoth undertaking . It must be universal and unanimous . " <P> The sportsmen 's statement , and the Buchmanites ' editing of Sportswriter Vidmer 's comment , were egregious examples of an Oxford Group technique which has slowly matured during the years Dr. Buchman has been at work . For Buchmanites it has not been enough to propagate , among " key people , " the doctrine of God 's direct and special " guidance " of his favorites , and the advantages of living according to the four Buchmanite standards of Absolute Honesty , Love , Purity and Unselfishness . The **27;2626;TOOLONG technique has also been to involve newsworthy non-Buchmanites , simply by getting them to agree publicly that the world is in a bad way , that some-thing needs to be done . <P> The Oxford Group has been engaged , for more than a decade , in " doing something " about the lives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men are changed , nations will change , the world will change . To many Protestant churchmen-but to few Catholics ( most of whom deny the reality of Buchmanite " change " ) - this is a praiseworthy and exciting aim . Hence many a Protestant , conscious of the unhappy shortcomings of his church , gives his support to the happy shortcuts of the Oxford Group , rather than hinder something which may do some good . Buchmanism 's brisk conversions ( drunks into teetotal testifiers , golfing brokers into junior wardens , black sheep into white sheep ) appeal to many an earnest , evangelical modern ; its vague theology does not offend his beliefs . This attitude was brilliantly exemplified in last week 's Manhattan Citizens ' Meeting .
