To tempestuous , highbrowed Jay Catherwood Hormel , president of meat-packing ( Geo . A. ) Hormel &; Co. , World War II is anathema . How to keep the U. S. out of it has become his most solemn thought . Month ago at Chicago 's American Legion Convention he got a bright idea : a popular song , a song that would sweep the nation like Barney Google or The Music Goes ' Round and ' Round . <P> Serious , handsome Jay C. got Professional Songwriter Harry Harris ( collaborator in the current hit : Baby Me ) , told him what he wanted . Last week he had it : a baleful ditty , words and music by Harris , fervent approval by pop-eyed Songster Eddie Cantor , title by Hormel : <P> THIS AI N'T OUR WAR ! <P> Never interfere if you should hear a battle <P> through your wall , <P> So your neighbor and his wife may not <P> agree , <P> And that 's the way the U. S. A. should feel <P> about the brawl , <P> Taking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WAR ! <P> We do n't want that kind of trouble any <P> more . <P> A lot of us remember when we went across to France , <P> And what did we get ? What did we get ? <P> We got a kick in the pants . No ! <P> THIS AI N'T OUR WAR ! <P> Not unless they come a-knockin ' at our <P> door . <P> If they want to fight each other , well , it 's none of our affair , <P> We have n't any mothers with an extra son to spare , <P> Let 's sing " God Bless America " instead of <P> " Over There , " <P> THIS AI N'T OUR WAR ! <P> This is only one more example of young ( 47 ) Jay C. 's industrial nonconformism . From the Hormel plant at Austin , Minn. , he upset the packing industry with canned whole ham , spiced ham , canned whole chicken , beef stock soups and , lately , Spam ( canned pork for making spam-wiches , etc . ) . There two years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ O. , defying packing industry precedent . He also guaranteed his workers 52 paychecks a year , and this year started a joint earnings plan which lets employes share the Hormel surplus ( if any ) with stockholders on a profits-wages ratio . <P> A showman before he thought of This Ai n't Our War , Jay C. proved his feeling for box office several years ago . To push Hormel 's chile con carne , he cooked up an expensive musical show called the " Hormel Chile-Beaners , " sent it barnstorming through Minnesota . It salted away Jay C. 's right to the title of the Billy Rose of the meat packers . <P> None of these pyrotechnics has hurt Hormel 's business . Since Jay C. took over , his company has had only one bad year : a $608,779 deficit in 1931 . Last year it netted a comfortable $1,031,574 profit on sales of $56,921,648 worth of meat , vegetables , poultry products , paid a $1.50 dividend on 474,990 shares of common .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
