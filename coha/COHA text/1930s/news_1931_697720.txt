txt While available statistics indicate that first quarter shipments of farm equipment will be only 20% to 25% under the phenomenally large first quarter of 1930 , completion of shipments on Soviet orders toward the end of this month is likely to bring the depressed condition of domestic business into sharp relief . Competent sources estimate production of farm equipment thus far in 1931 , exclusive of the Soviet orders , to be about 60% of that of the like period in 1930 , with greater part of such production consisting of row crop tractors and implements for use with those machines . Sales of one large concern which manufactures parts for farm equipment companies , the business of which is sufficiently large and well enough distributed to present a fair cross-section of the industry , are running approximately 80% under a year ago . However , since the farm equipment companies generally carried large stocks of parts into 1931. this low rate of parts demand does not mean that production of farm equipment companies has been curtailed to a like degree . Russian Orders Maintain Output The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavy schedules because of the necessity of making deliveries before the end of March with the result that first quarter shipments as a whole would be generally in line with recent estimates of banking interests close to the industry which placed the first quarter 1931 business at a level only 20% under the extremely good first quarter of last year . The Midwest division , however , which is by far the greatest farm equipment shipping section in the country , was placed at 25% under the like period of 1930 . The Midwest territory includes the important manufacturing plants of International Harvester Co. , Deere &; Co. , J. L Case Co. , Oliver Farm Equipment Co. ( except the Nichols &; Shepard branch ) , the Moline plant of Minneapolis-Moline Power Implement Co. , Allis Chalmers tractor plant , Advance-Rumely Corp. , Massey Harris tractor plant , and Caterpillar Tractor Co Fanners ' Purchasing Power Curtailed difficult as yet to tell how second quarter shipments this year will compare with those of 1930 , it is unlikely that production will be in excess of the like 1930 period . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ balance sheets of the companies , are high , an that domestic retail demand would have to be brisk before it would be reflected materially in the shipments from factories to warehouses and before manufacturing would have to be stepped up . Elimination of dOwn payment , and extension of credit to farmers to three instead of two harvests on the part of large manufacturing units in the industry will tend somewhat to alleviate the conditions arising from the restricted rural credit which so severely affected sales of farm equipment last ' year . However , prices of agricultural products today , including grains and livestock , are materially under those of a year ago and the purchasing power of the farmer therefore is correspondingly curtailed . The restriction of rural credit also is reflected in the suspension by the International Harvester Co. of production of its 15-SO h. p. tractors at the Milwaukee plant on March 15 , or earlier than usual , indicating the company 's belief that stocks on hand already are sufficient to take care of its spring trade . Production of Harvester 's 10-20 Farman tractors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other companies in the group is on approximately the same level . Distribution of Soviet Orders The Soviet orders received last fall , the greater part of which will be completed by the end of this month , were distributed among the various companies approximately as follows : International Harvester Co. , 12,000 15-30 tractors and 1,000 Farmalls ; Oliver Farm Equipment Co. , 5,000 tractors , 1,500 combines and about $1,000,000 in implements ; Deere &; Co. , 4,000 Model D tractors ; J. I. Case Co. , 4,000 tractors ; Massey-Harris Co. , 2,500 tractors , and Caterpillar Tractor Co. , 1,500 tractors . In addition there was an implement order of about $6,060,000 of which it is understood Harvester and Deere received the major proportion . Terms on these orders for the most part ranged from 40g to 50% cash , with the balance due in two to three years . Caterpillar 's terms were somewhat better than 50% cash with no part of the balance extending past two years .                  @ @ @
