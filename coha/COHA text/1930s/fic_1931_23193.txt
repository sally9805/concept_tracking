THE BASKET A STORY BY E. CLEMENT JONES G " 0 NOW , " they said , " and take this basket with you . Do n't open it yet , not till you pass the fork . Go now , it 's time . " Muffled and bony , her knees spread out to make a wider lap . A right hand worked itself round the handle of the basket , holding it . The eyes solemnized themselves still further , shone somberly at the mystery beneath the cover , something for her  --  the cover tightly bound with twine . The left hand , more passionate and uninstructed , less stiffened to a curve by work , lieutenant only of the right hand , with free hours of its own , held to the wrinkled ardency of her breast a doll dressed also for traveling , whose wax mouth still showed faintly red after these years of kisses ardent yet gentle . Three days now she and the doll had sat there , waiting for those who were coming to take them away from the poorhouse @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the afternoon drew in . Here they could wait no longer  --  now the poorhouse must be closed . The other dependents had already been placed about the village , and the town would pay their bed and board for as long as they lived in the world . But she had someone  --  not relatives , but friends of distant relatives  --  who , she said , would come and take her . Several weeks ago they had written this . The date was cut in her mind . No one could forget that date , this day set separate from all others in the days and years . Yet so far they hart not come . A post card came yesterday saying they would try to be there on the afternoon train . This was enough to go on . Those in authority here had done everything exactly right until now  --  there remained only a little chance to take , only a little time to bridge until their ease of mind should be clear again . Enough to go on , and she had nine dollars of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her to go . Only a little urging , only a little reassurance , and the encouraging smile bred of relief . A basket , too ; they had given her a basket , the cover tied down with knotted string . What if the basket were empty ? Even so , it might be enough to start , her on her way from the house where she had lived so long . And they were right : this propulsion of hope , even near the end of life , warding off that other mystery  --  this would cause her to rise from the chair where she sat in the middle of the room with the folds of her brown dress round her  --  this would impel her to get up , cross the well-known floor , step down from the door-stone , break the habits of twenty-two years . " Come , warm your feet before you start . The coal and wood are gone , but there is still some fire left . Come closer . " Obediently she came from the middle of the room  --  she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the worn panels of this arbitrary shelter . Yet to please them now she held out one foot , then the other before the glowing ashes , though it was easy to see she preferred to keep her feet beneath the deep foldings of her dress . So soon as it seemed to her polite she stood up again , tied the doll 's cloak tighter round it , hid it in the dark under her breast , under her cape  --  two layers of warmth and dark , warmth for its comfort , dark safety for its rarity . In her pliant left hand she held the doll . Then the right hand , the worker , took up the mystery , took up the basket , opened the door , and went . As they watched , " It is not far , " they said . " They will he there at the station . You remember where it is . " She thought that she remembered , though she had not seen it now for many years . " Not far , " they said again . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not look exactly at each other as they spoke to her  --  and when they saw her brown dress going down between the pines they turned rapidly to finish shutting up the house before the light should go . Damp autumn air saturated the pines and oaks , making them greener , making them redder . Each needle , each leaf hung separate , dripping , the drops sliding slowly to the ground where also each blade stood motionless in saturation . No sound in the pines , no pulse in the wind to move the pines ? but through this silence the other pulse , self-originating , beat through the stillness as a slow powerful muscle beats , felt in the blood rather than heard in the ear  --  the ocean beyond the sand beyond the woods . October afternoons darken quickly  --  and as she went farther down the narrow road through the cairn and dripping woods rooted where theystood , she felt lonely . The walls of the room where she had long lived , the surrounding margin of her solitude gone , the cycle of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours for sleep , shores to the mystery of otherwise undivided time  --  gone also . She felt lonely , so " Now I 'll open the basket , " she said , speaking to the doll in the darkness and warmth under her breast . This basket  --  what could be in this basket ? ? held the surprise , the new arrangement of unusual things coming together to make a hope at the end of life . She looked at the cover tied tightly down , and it seemed to her that if she opened it now she would not have it to open later  --  it would be done and could not again be done . The cover could not again be lifted for the first time . " Wait till we get to the third tree , " she said to the doll . " There is a big stone there . When we get to the stone we 'll open the basket . " A wild apple tree with a few clear yellow leaves still hanging to the stunted boughs bent out over this stone , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right hand then she took off her cloak and laid the doll upon it . The doll looked up under the hat wreathed with small velvet leaves  --  her autumn hat . She had a spring hat as well . Every year the doll had one thing that was new . Moreover his mother made him a little coat , and Itrought it to him from year to year , when she came up with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice . She remembered that , and Hannah calling Samuel from the altar where he ministered before the Lord clad in a linen ephod , calling him with impressed but secret urgent finger , trying on the coat and the bigger size always right , taking away with her the worn and outgrown coat , year after year . By now she was lonelier than she had been before she reached the stone , so she said to the doll , " You are not lonely , are you ? - You have me . You are not lonely . I know very well you are not lonely . How could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ failed to move , yet in her own heart the doll answered her , " No , I am not lonely . I have you . You never will be lonely either . You have me . " Both hands , the left hand and the right , came to concentration on the knotted twine . These knots were several , tied tight . Her fingers were stiff , grew eager . Eagerness increased the stiffness . She worked terribly  --  pushed back her hat , sweat stood out along her forehead , across her lip . The end of her tongue she held between her teeth . And the knots remained tied tight . She looked round her , and two drops of sweat rolled down her face . She saw then that beyond the apple grew a quince , long since grown wild . Once a house would have stood there , these fruit trees planted by those now scattered . From this quince she ripped a long sharp thorn , and as she did so a rotted quince dropped to the ground and smashed in the damp growth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hat fell backward to the ground and , straightening from her labor , she stepped on the old velvet rose . She worked fiercely with the thorn . One knot stretched and separated , one other also . The third she could not loosen , so she frayed it with the thorn . Now the string lay slack as a snake about the basket . Again the somber eyes solemnified themselves and shone . With her left fingers then she lifted up the doll , so that she also might see the cover raised on the emergent hope , on the mystery lying quiet there  --  the possession that would be for them as long as they both should live . The right hand  --  slow , diffident , and tremulous  --  lifted the cover . She stared inside . For several moments they both stared inside . A mistake . Nothing in the basket  --  nothing . Nothing there . She thought now that the mistake was hers . Too soon , she had untied the string too soon . " Do n't open it till you pass the fork @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waited . But it was not endurable to her , it was not possible , that this basket , this ark of treasure , should be empty ; since already  --  before she had untied the string , so soon indeed as they had given her the basket  --  she had transferred her will to this internal mystery . Clear , clear to such a one  --  in this moment all her unlived lives crowding hard against her yet forever beyond her backward reach  --  the mistakes all clear . Furious now the fire to obliterate this error , to rectify all blunders . The experience of all those years  --  both the real and the imagined experience  --  could not be completely lost , could not come to an end in emptiness , must leave some record or residue , something to which she might pin her hope , something to go on with . Obscurely , now , the basket had begun to signify this fruit of her long years , this promise , this hope ; and something in her more compulsive than conscious thought determined that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . So now she fitted back the cover , picked up the string , and tied the cover down again with two knots and two frayed ends . She found her bat , brushed the rain and sand from the dark velvet rose . Some drops of dampness splashed heavily on the face of the doll until she saw and wiped them carefully away with the fingertips of her left hand . Now she comforted the doll . " Do n't cry , " she said . " Do n't cry . " And the doll spoke to her in her turn . " Do n't cry , " said the doll . " You have me always , as long as we both shall live . " So they continued down the road , the doll pressing its round head in the warm dark beneath her breast . Yet in spite of her compacting will , her own thoughts were confused . " But they said . . . No , they had only said Go now , and take this basket . Do n't open it till you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ why did they tie the cover down so tight then ? But she had not waited till they got to the fork in the road . She had been able to bear it no longer . Her fault . Her fault . " What have I done ? " she said . And holding hard to the basket , the cradle she had emptied of its life , she continued walking once more along the wet and dusky road . And as she walked she began to fill the basket with a life illusory and swift , drawn internally and entirely from herself  --  as anyone may do , the external illusions or objects of passion having failed . And as she walked it seemed to her that already she was being granted a respite from her mistake . Soon she came to the fork  --  and as she did so , emerging from the shadows of the trees , it seemed to her that she had fallen into a cold bright space , very cold , very bright . So she shut her eyes , remembering the walls of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the edges of the narrow road strictly bound by vines and hushes . It seemed to her that these things had thrown her from them . And with eyes still nearly shut against the light and cold , she looked about bewildered for the doll . But in a minute more she found her , clutched tight in her own hand , just as she had lain there all the time . She tried to remember forward in this cold wideness of late afternoon , in the yellow streaks of light lingering so strangely , which road led to the station . Her memory made a decision . She went on walking . It seemed to her that she was going to meet somebody . Presently she saw the lamp shine palely from its metal reflector through the station window . She came to the platform binding the straight steel rails also shining pale and far in the yellow twilight . And now beyond two green lights high to the left she saw a burning circle come and the sideways roll of steam with rosy findings through its convolutions . Her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years , not since engines had higher smokestacks , not squat and hissing like this engine that slid so smoothly to the platform . Behind its shoulder , the lights turned from green to red , guarding the train , setting a limit . Something had been done , something finished . The red lights guarded this action with finality . Yet ahead of the train on two other signal- towers shone two other lights violet lights , of a violet so intense that only at certain angles the crimson central arcs from which the violet spread were darkly seen . They said  --  these violet circles  --  a train is standing at the station , not yet beginning to move forward . We are the violet lights , the potential , the mystery uncovered , yes , but not revealed  --  we are the not-no , the margin of the act to come . Three people came down the steps of the train  --  an old man who crossed the track and disappeared into the woods ; a young man and woman with flushed faces carrying two new valises . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one had come for her . The engineer looked back . Violet lights changed to green , a clear road for the coming act . The whole train , spined with iron , moved forward , going faster  --  and when its end went past , red lights superseded violet , to guard in turn this timed achievement . And when the whole was out of sight , green lights again showed invitation and assurance for other acts to follow . Now the man with the lantern put out the light in the station , turned the key in the lock , and approached her where she stood , an old figure in many folds , unstirring in the dusk . " You were expecting someone ? " " Is that all the people who were on the train ? " she asked . " All who got off here , " he answered . He stood waiting , to go home to supper where the light from the lamp slanted down on the spread table , where his wife waited with his child . He stood waiting ; so to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road where she had come . She comforted the doll . " Some day , " she said , " they will come . I have made a mistake . " And the doll answered , " Whether they come or not you have me with you  --  as long as we both shall live . " They had not come  --  the friends of distant relatives . She could go back now , frightened and relieved , to the familiar place . After a long time she found the road into the woods again . And as she turned in between the pines , little but old , and saw in the remaining light the grapevines binding the wet bushes and felt the continuous ruts stiffening a little in the chill , it seemed as if relief had come to her from somewhere far off . " Do n't be tired . Do n't be hungry , " she said to the doll . " We shall be there soon . " And the doll answered , " Soon . " When they reached the big stone under the tree @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there beside her , and took the doll in both her hands and comforted her , rocking her with head bent down . ? Presently she felt footsteps coming along the wet ground , and then two men came out of an intersecting path and stopped to look at her . They wore ridged hunters ' caps covered with scarlet cloth , and scarlet cloth wassewed down over their shoulders and breasts like the shape of their lungs . They carried guns in their hands , and the barrels of these guns shone secretly in the wet light . They knew their guns were well-oiled and clean  --  they had drawn soft strips of oily linen through them all the morning , getting ready . They had heard a little while ago a rustle and a breaking stick  --  a deer must be about . Warm with whisky in the damp twilight , they were in good spirits , ready for anything . They stood in front of her . " And what have you in the basket ? " Her fingers folded quickly round the handle , round the peeled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the doll deeper , folded her cloak above it . - Why not tell us ? It must be good , all tied up so tight . Wo n't you give us some ? " one said , drawing down the corner of his mouth , and the other shut one eye . She sat extremely still . " Come now , " said the first man , " what is in it ? " And with an accurate movement , quick as a shot , he thrust the barrel of his gun through the handle of the basket and lifted it away from her . Surprised by its lightness , he whirled it round and round , while her eyes stretched open and she kept putting out her right hand to reach it . And at the same time she folded in the left side of her cloak more tightly . " Do you know what ? " asked the man , rocking back and forth before her , " I believe there 's nothing in it . " His lips parted wider , showing his strong healthy teeth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she folded her cloak in and in . The second man came also and stood in front of her . " And what have you got tucked away so tight under your cape ? " he said . Under the velvet hat with the old velvet rose the sweat again came out , so that the hat stuck to her head , and she could scarcely push it off her forehead . " Come , let us see , " he repeated . He felt well on this wet evening with the whisky warming all his blood . And because it was getting dark and she , though old , remained silent , cloaked , voluminous  --  he stepped up to her , swiftly jerking back her cape . And there under her left breast lay the smiling doll , her face turned outward toward the scarlet caps and shoulders , almost as if she liked them and had turned herself to look . Unfolding the iron fingers of the left hand and laughing , the man took the doll away from her . " Look , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face . And here , " he said , turning back the doll 's skirts , fingering an edge of lace , " such pretty knees . " Then he shook his head , looked with commiseration at his friend . " But too young , " he said , " too young for love . " And with a hearty laugh he restored her to her mother . " Hurry along now , " he remarked to her , looking along the sleek barrel of his gun . " You might get hurt . " And they walked on down the cross-path where they had heard the breaking stick . She went as quickly as she could , but now it seemed to her that the familiar trees and the outlines of the house which , pale and large , appeared among them , were all strange , as if  --  though she had known them all these years  --  she had never really known them , that what was real about them was perhaps not what was real to the house and to the trees themselves . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she kept on looking were not smiling at her but at the memory of the hunters . At last she felt entirely alone . She thought the doll knew more than she . No one had ever done to her what they had done to the doll , and she was filled with horror and respect . Nolonger was the doll a child to cherish and protect . Now  --  certainly  --  she was alone , as the parent whose child has grown up feels once more alone . Yet not for long did she think she felt this way  --  though she did not speak again directly to the doll but to herself . " I shall have her with me , " she said , " as long as we both shall live . " I ? the silence then she heard a cracking shot . And then another . As she came nearer to the house , in spite of its look of unlighted unfamiliarity , there was much about it that she recognized . She remembered the two who had started her on her journey earlier in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seemed to her that she had not sufficiently vindicated those who had given her the basket . She should have said to the hunters , " There is something in the basket . There is . There is . " And perhaps if the people were still there they would explain what had happened , what she had done to destroy the mystery of the basket , to change the surprise . Perhaps they would explain of themselves , for she could not ask them . She did not know why , but she thought that if she asked them it might hurt them , and they might grow embarrassed . So she thought they might explain about the basket . And if she were able to carry the basket on some other day for a long distance say for twice the distance she had carried it to-day  --  for a long distance without opening it , perhaps she would be given another opportunity to discover the treasure she had dissipated by her fault . And , indeed , the basket did seem to be growing heavier , as if by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again . By now the basket was becoming quite heavy , and seemed almost to have a motion of its own , as if something with life stirred inside it . So that presently she became more conscious of it than of the doll  --  a child , now , no longer  --  held in the fingers of her left hand . She walked carefully lest she disturb the equilibrium of increasing life within the basket . She had by now almost reached the house . The first stars showed palely , and near the horizon that other hunter , Orion , began climbing from the winter sea . There was no wind , the low pines stood unmoving against the streak of light now turned to green , and in this silence beat the pulse of the ocean beyond the sand beyond the pines . Like the pulse of blood through a hand that steadily soothes an anxious , an uneasy sleeper . " Hush , " it said . " Hush , " it said , " and fear no more . " She saw , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , only the pale unfamiliar familiarity of the walls . She addressed the doll no more directly , but she spoke to herself about her , as if she brooded on her safety , no longer sharing equal dangers and delights . " Nothing can hurt her while I live , " she said . And there flashed before her the grin of the hunters and the outward-turning face of the doll . How had the doll turned herself round from where her lips lay against her breast to smile out upon the hunters with their scarlet caps and shoulders ? Had she herself twisted the doll round to watch the hunters with her as if they were on their guard together ? And it seemed to her that at the end of life she knew nothing , nothing , nothing . But the weight of the basket in her right hand now took almost all her strength . She must not let it drop because of its heaviness , since the movement within proved that it was precious , that its strength was greater than her own and might:survive her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to fill the void of her mistake , the basket filled with life which even now struggled against the cover . And again the anticipation became so great , her impatience to open the basket so overwhelming that she kept on saying to herself , " No , you must not , No , you must not . " And it seemed to her that if she were to fray open again with a sharp thorn these knots or break the string with passionate haste , this mounting mystery would die stillborn and that all she could ever say again would be , " What have I done ? What have I done ? " So to defend herself from this temptation , she began to walk round and round the house , to see the house in the dim evening light as she had never before seen it . She saw that in moving out the furniture a window had been broken  --  the invisible wall of glass between the house and the air  --  the house was become a part of the air , no break between it and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the sheds , the outhouse , and the barn  --  unlighted by the reflection of any shine within the house  --  shone with a slight phosphorescent memory of their own . In the barn she saw once more the splintered mangers , chewed by cows , kicked by horses , with a tuft of horse 's hair  --  Sally 's , the strawberry roan , now sold  --  caught in a sliver , the worn stanchions where Sue and Bess and Pansy rubbed the loose folds of their submissive melancholy necks . At the corner of the outhouse grew the giant plant of ink-berry , with lush wet stalks  --  even in autumn the leaves still bright green , veined with magenta , and the black-purple berries ripe to fall for the propagation of more lushness , of some bright strong growth like cruelty or lies . A handsome plant , lush and ever-living , rich and handsome by the outhouse . Now she walked round to the front door  --  locked , as indeed always  --  the back door locked . But the side door remained open , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lost , the handle loose , and the step broken in , showing the grass and sorrel underneath . So she pushed open the door , which swung after her and then swung wide again . With a strong tread she walked up the stairs , carrying the light doll that weighed so little in the practiced caress of her left hand , not so spontaneous now  --  but loyal , very loyal  --  and carrying the heavy basket , so heavy that it unbent even the stiffness of her over-worked right hand . Past the long row of similar little rooms she walked , those shelters arbitrary but not unkind of weakness and defeat . Then at last into that room , pulling open the door of double thickness , removed from the others , with iron bars close together across the window , with worn heavy wooden hooks projecting from the wall , higher than a human head but not too high for tethered human wrists , with roughened places on the floor beneath , where feet had shuffled back and forth within a narrow range . And at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ road between the old and little pines , in the pale evening light upon unending roads  --  and no one who looked out at that window would ever know again what happened there beyond the place where they could see , where other roads struck in and crisscrossed through the world . And no more food and water would be thrust in through the small sliding panel near the bottom of the door to those who sat upon the floor too dangerous or too dazed to touch . And as she stood , pitying those who had struggled there , it was a delight to feel through her right hand the movement in the heavy basket and to know that she was threaded to real life and the unbroken thread through her to all the future . She walked downstairs again and in the darkness found her way to her own room , the room where she had sat for many years , silent and voluminous , under her many-folded dress in the middle of the floor . There were no chairs left , only a torn shred of newspaper lying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acts lying in one corner . And she looked about her , for she felt that she had still a long time to wait . By the fireplace , where a thin smoke but no fire was still rising up the chimney , a wooden box not needed for the packing stood end up . Shoving this with her foot , in order not to loosen from her hold the doll or basket , she set it square , sat down on it , and spread her dress about her . Then laying the doll across her knees and setting the basket close between her feet so that the contact remained unbroken , she took off her hat and pressed her fingers slowly through her hair . Holding her feet still tight about the basket , she removed the cloak and hat also from the doll and smoothed its skirts down straight . And as she remembered the hunters  --  whom indeed she had scarcely forgotten  --  she wondered what would happen to the doll . And again she seemed to herself to be younger , less knowing than the doll @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she not the basket full of life ? It seemed to her that now certainly she must lift the cover  --  that she could wait no longer . She still said nothing to the doll , and the doll said not a syllable to her , lying there  --  remembering with a smile she did not recognize . By now the room was dark , but presently beyond the broken window where the air breathed in and out , beyond the cloud which in the chilled and clearing air was moving off , a thin moon came out and stood apart  --  and its sharp rays seemed almost to reach the place where she was sitting . All was still , and again there entered through the window ' the sound of even pulsing , of the pulse felt more than heard beyond the sand beyond SOME DAY WHEN YOU 'VE FORGOTTEN ME 583 the pines . " Hush , " said the sea . " Hush , " it said . " And fear no more . " And it seemed to her that she became the vehicle of generations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the daughter  --  became a small tip on a many-branching stick of light , a tentative light that soon might flicker and go out , the sterile daughter of a semi-sterile mother . But the basket leaped between her feet , and the life within bounded against the cover . Now indeed she must lift the cover but , remembering her former failure , she said " Not yet , " and bending down , tied the two frayed ends of string into a third and tighter knot . And the leap of life again inside the basket showed her that she was right . When that life , from which she kept her hands , had found strength itself to burst the cover  --  then she would nurture it and tend it and in its own time leave it to stand alone . Now the sharp moon was gone , sinking behind the pines , to return larger and larger on succeeding evenings . The room became completely dark . Still through the window came the pulsing " Fear no more , " savage and gentle . " Fear no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and leaped . And presently it seemed to her that it began to beat and shine with light that shone between its woven strands . And it seemed to her also that she was young again and all life lay before her .
