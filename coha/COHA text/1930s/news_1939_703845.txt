txt Editor The New York Times Book Review , May we call the attention of your readers to certain misapprehensions on the part of Cuthbert Wright , who reviewed " A Diary of My Times " by Georges Bernanos in the Book Review section for Feb. 5 , 1939 ? Mr. Wright specifically states that his review is one of interpretation , but his principles seem to agree with those of M. Bernanos , who quite definitely has not grasped the essentials of Catholic theology . He considers M. Bernanos to be " uncompromisingly a Catholic " and he approves the exordium of his book in which M. Bernanos states he does not " wish the church to be perfect . " But the definitions of the Council of Trent describe the Catholic Church as perfect , holy and apostolic . These definitions are binding on all Catholics . The denial of any of them removes the one so denying from good standing in the church . In addition , the charge against the church in this same paragraph that " the world is full of poor people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and is offensive to more than 300,000,000 Catholics who hold that the church is divinely founded by God , who is truth and can not deceive . If M. Bernanos and Mr. Wright are thinking of individual Catholics recusant to their religion and false to their truth  --  and there are of course such to be found occasionally  --  they fail in the book and in the review to make the distinction between such faithless Catholics and the church . As to the specific charge against the church in Mallorca which arouses the indignation of both M. Bernanos and Mr. Wright , these have been disposed of by the proper authorities and denied . Mr. Wright permits himself a calumny against the Spanish hierarchy , who have officially presented the issues and situation in Spain and the Spanish war , the English translation of which was published in full by THE New YORK TIMES itself , and their stand was approved by His Holiness Pius XI . M. R. MADDEN . Brooklyn . Luther 's Religion I perused , in THE NEW Yoax TIMES Book Review , Feb. 19 , Walter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Power , " by Joseph Bernhart , translated by George N. Schuster . The following gave me pause : " As to Martin Luther , his apostasy of long development had begun when his spirit rebelled against the same baleful influence while first in Rome in 1510 and he bad heard and seen , had stored up in his heart , many a scandal by the time he was ready to return to his monastery cell . " May I say , a study of Martin Luther 's authentic writings inclines me to the belief that his account of " scandals in Rome " might well be as distorted as his doctrines . For instance : Writing " On the Captivity of the Human Will , " he says : " Man 's will is like a horse : if God rides it , it goes and wills as God wills ; if the devil , it goes as the devil wills . " Again : " God does evil in us as well as good ; and even as He justifies us without merit , so also He damns us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he did the bondage of man 's will , he maintained on the other his freedom and immunity from all law . He explains as follows ( the second chapter of the Epistle to the Galatians ) : " If thy conscience says to thee , ' Thou hast sinned , ' then answer ' Yes ! ' But if it says , ' Therefore will God punish and condemn thee , ' answer ' No ! ' But the law tells this ? Thou mayest say , ' The law is nothing to me . ' And wherefore ? ' Because I am free ! ' " He lays down the same doctrine in his book on the Babylonish captivity . " I say boldly , " he there writes , " that the Christian can be burthened with no law , either by men or angels , except in so far as he himself wills it , for we are free from all . " He terms St. James 's Epistle an Epistle of Straw ! JERE J. ALCOCK . Brooklyn . D'avenant 's Life Editor The New York @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biography of " Sir William D'avenant : Poet Laureate and Playwright , " in your issue of Jan. 15 , Mr. Percy Hutchison makes some statements that must strike serious students of D'avenant and his period as unwarranted by credible evidence . 1 . " The boy D'avenant was Shakespeare 's godson. * * " This myth has been discarded along with Aubrey 's scandalous story that attributed D'avenant 's paternity to the Bard . Edmund Gosse and other scholars who have diligently combed the records have been unable to find any reliable contemporary corroboration for such rumors . Yet Mr. Hutchison presents the above as accepted fact ! 2 . " Lord Brooke , who had been Shakespeare 's friend , took the lad into his establishment . " What authority can Mr. Hutchison give us that Fulke Greville , Lord Brooke , was a " friend " of the citizen of Stratford who died in April , 1616 ? If he has any direct proof of this statement he should have cited it in his review . for it would be of very great interest to thousands of persons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographical trail very keenly indeed . We know from many credible sources that Lord Brooke was a close personal friend of Francis Bacon until Bacon fell into disgrace and that the same nobleman was well acquainted with Edward de Vere , Earl of Oxford ? did , in fact , purchase Oxford 's residence at Hackney after the literary Earl 's death early in the reign of James I  --  but that Lord Brooke was on familiar terms with the resident of Stratford-onAvon is a matter that requires substantiation. 3 . Mr. Hutchison states that the revolutionary movement in the English theatre which made it possible for women to replace men in the enactment of female parts began in 1629 with the presentation of a court masque in which Henrietta Maria , the Queen of Charles I , and her French attendants took the leading roles . " Inigo Jones was called in to mount the piece and D'avenant to write it . " In his " Crudities , " published in 1611 , Thomas Coryat says that while he had never seen women macting female characters in public prior to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the thing Peing done on the public stages n London . Moreover , one has mly to consult the chronologies of Ben Jonson and Inigo Jones to see that these worthies were producing theatrical extravaganzas at court as early as Twelfth Night , 1605 , with several of the foremost ladies of the land taking part . Of the 1606 " Masque of Hymen , " Mr. John Pory wrote to Sir Robert Cotton : " Both Inigo , Ben and the actors , men and women , did their parts with great commendation . " The playbooks and sketches for the scenery and costumes of several of the most successful of these early Jonson-Jones court productions have come down to us , together with the casts of players . From these we learn that Queen Anne was an actress twenty-four years before her posthumous daughter - in - law , Henrietta Maria , trod the boards . According to these records and ample contemporary corroboration , Anne was supported in three spectacular productions between 1605 and 1609 by Elizabeth , Countess of Derby , and Susan , Countess of Montgomery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and by Lucy , Countess of Bedford , while a dozen other court beauties of this early period can be shown to have exercised their histrionic talents to large audiences of the aristocracy under Ben Jonson 's direction . It would seem , under the circumstances , misleading to attempt to put D'avenant forward as the innovator of an interesting development in English theatrical history when the credit so clearly belongs elsewhere . CHARLES WISNER BARRELL , Duty on Books Editor The New York Times Book Review : The reductions in the rates of duty levied on British books entering the United States , incorporated in the Anglo-American Trade Agreement , have been welcomed here by all concerned with the writing. , production and distribution of books . It may not be known to some of your readers , however , that all American books imported into Great Britain enter duty free . ( In my own business , the annual importation runs into many thousands . ) On the other hand , British books entering America are subject to duties ranging from 71/2 per cent to .201/2 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ameri. can readers and British authon alike . Relations between the two great English-speaking democracies have never been closer than they are today . With similar cultural ideas and interests , each country appreciates the literature of the other , and it is therefore in the public interest that books be sold as cheaply as possible . For some time I have been working for the complete abolition of the duty on all books , and I recently , by cable , drew President Roosevelt 's attention to the present anomalous position . I understand that many influential Americans have also approached President Roosevelt , of their own free will , in respect of the abolition of this duty on English publications . I should very much appreciate the hospitality of your columns to secure the support of American readers who are interested in the abolition of this tax . W. FOYLE , Managing Director , W. &; G.
