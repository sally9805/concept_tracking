txt While most estimates are that the proposed reduction in wages in the steel industry will amount to approximately 10% , the same as the first cut made last year , many of the smaller independent steel companies are in favor of a larger amount , believing that a 15% reduction would be justified under existing conditions of negligible earnings or operating losses , low op " White Collor " Pay C111 Despite the feeling that a second wage cut in the steel industry will be around 10% , the same as the first reduction made last October . many of the smaller units insist that is larger cut would be justified and arc talking of 15% . Unfavorable earnings and operating losses , low rates of operations , poor demand and the price situation are factors which will be weighed in the matter . The wage question Is expected to be diecussed informally at the meeting of directors of the American Iron &; Steel Institute next Thursday . The board Is made up of officials of practically every important steel company , so the views will cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made shortly after the gathering . U. S. Steel has cut its expenses by reducing the working time of many of the white collar workers of most If not all its subsidiary companies . Hereafter these employee will have three days off each month , which is equivalent to a pay reduction of 10% . It Is likely that any further downward readjustment in wages also will bring another salary cut for these workers . orations , poor demand and comparatively high overhead costs . Those who will decide the matter have declined to comment thus far and the lead will be taken by one of the larger units . The first reduction was announced by the U. S. Steel Corp . last September and was followed immediately by all other steel companies . A meeting of the directors of the Amert ... it Iron &; Steel Institute will be held next Thursday . Officials of practically every important steel concern are on this board , and it may be that there will be an informal discussion of the wage problem at that time , to be followed shortly by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the individual companies and is not necessarily uniform throughout the industry . U. S. Steel Cutting Expenses U. S. Steel already has taken steps to reduce its expenses further through shorter working months for many of the white collar employee of most if not all the subsidiary companies . Beginning with the current month these employes are taking off three days monthly . This is equivalent to a reduction in salary coats or these workers of about 10 ' , i . Mill workers of the Steel Corp . and other leading steel makers have been working short time for much more than a year under the stagger plan by which the activities are distributed among as many of the mill hands as possible , but this is the first time the Steel Corp . has put into practice a somewhat similar plan among the office employes . A number of other steel companies have been working under such reduced employment since last summer . In some instances the office workers of other concerns have one day off each week , making a reduction of 16 2-3% in their compensation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bookkeeping , sales and other departments . Apparently the Steel Corp . finally , has been compelled to take somewhat similar action , though not nearly as drastic in its effect on employes as that of its competitors . While nothing official has become known regarding the plans for further salary and wage reductions , it is considered likely that despite the saving of 10% by the enforced lay-off of white collar workers of the Steel Corp . there will be another cut in these salaries when action is taken in connection with the wage rates in the manufacturing and other plants . Could Save $8,000,000 Quarterly Due to the many factors which enter the situation it is difficult to estimate the saving to come to the steel industry from another salary and wage reduction . In the case of the U. S. Steel Corp . it was stated officially that the first action taken resulted in a saving of $3,991,000 up to the end of last year . Saving dated partly from August 15 , when salaries were reduced , and fully from October 1 , when the wage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ current year steel operations have been trending downward . so that the per ton cost must have increased to some extent . However , with other economies effected and with operations and prices maintained near the rate of the final three months of 1931 the corporation could save approximately $3,500,000 to $4,000,000 per quarter from another reduction of 10% , and between $5,500,000 and $6 , - 000.000 from a cut of 15q . Efforts are being made to maintain steel prices . In some instances advances in quotations have been put into effect as of April 1 . These prices have not been tested as yet because consumers are not in the market . If prices could be held the steel companies would be in a better position than they have been in more than a year . A firmer price structure and a moderate increase in operations would be important in reducing overhead and result in much greater benefits from the salary and wage reductions now planned .
