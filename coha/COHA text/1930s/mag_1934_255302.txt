A smart Los Angeles lawyer named Martineau was made a Special Assistant U. S. Attorney General and summoned to Washington . The Department of Interior 's much-publicized Investigator Louis R. Glavis was once more in the spotlight . It was darkly hinted that revelations would be more scandalous than anything since Teapot Dome . Attorney General Cummings and Secretary Ickes conferred with the President . A Federal board was hastily announced to issue ' ' tenders " without which not a drop of East Texas oil could be accepted for shipment in interstate commerce . And . as the Washington marching and countermarching continued , newshawks were informed last week that the Government was about to launch its latest &; greatest drive against the recalcitrant producers of " hot oil . " <P> What stirred the Administration to one more desperate effort to save its oil program from complete collapse was the rip-roaring gasoline price-war which , from the Rocky Mountains to the Atlantic Ocean , made motoring a joy ( TIME , Oct. 22 ) . <P> Ostensibly a free-for-all between independent distributors and the major companies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contest was touched off by the flood of oil produced in excess of state quotas . By last week the only apparent check to price-slashing was a clause in the Oil Code limiting cuts to no more than one every 24 hours . Retail prices were off from 2 to 9 per gal . <P> Skirmishes were going on in nearly every big city east of the Mississippi . Along the seaboard it had settled down to a pitched battle between Standard Oil of New Jersey and the independents , with every other oil company helplessly drawn in . Standard was determined to keep its prices above the independents and the independents were equally determined to maintain a 1 differential . <P> In Camden the price was down to about 5 exclusive of taxes and motorists were madly storing fuel in tanks , cans , barrels , buckets , bottles . It was estimated that the oil companies were losing 3 to 4 on every gallon sold . Harry Ford Sinclair , who has felt the heavy hand of the Standard companies in his time , remarked : " It 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ annihilation . "
