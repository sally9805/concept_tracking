NCE in his life , almost every man builds a house , buys a house , or wishes he could . Those who wish they could are in the majority , naturally . But it is a safe bet that few of them do their wishing with the intensity of millions who have bought houses , or built houses , and wish they had n't . And why do millions wish they had not built or bought ? In the ease of the man who bought , it may be because he failed to put on his overalls , snake his way under a house , and plunge an ice pick into the joists and mud sills . As a result , he finds himself sitting on dry rot , or playing host to an enthusiastic army of termites . For houses , like shortstops , are no better than their underpinning . In the case of the man who built , it may be because his eager and optimistic eye passed carelessly over the fine type reading new public improvements authorized " when he bought his lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousands of dollars on a lot that cost him only a few hundreds . They ca n't do that to him ? True , the Constitution of the United States says that a man can not be deprived of his property without due Process of law , but thousands of Americans , nevertheless , have lost their homes through special assessments about which they had nothing to say . Does this mean that to buy or to build is an enterprise mined with so many mysterious and perilous pitfalls that the average man had better continue to pay his monthly tribute to the landlord in return for deliverance from them ? Not at all , if he and his wife do not overestimate to what limi4a dollar cash can be stretched , and if they are willing to put a little more work and thought into a house than they devote to a new duck gun or new Lingerie . What kind of work and thought ? The record established by California 's State Veterans ' Welfare Board in housing has supplied answers that are likely to pay worthwhile dividends to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along to these answers , a word about what the California board is doing for the state 's Spanish War and World War veter-ans . Ask any banker or mortgage-company head how he would like to finance 14.596 small homes 100 per cent . His answer would be " Impossible . " Tell him that these homes must be modern , with at least two bedrooms . and yet average only S4655 in cost , and be sold on monthly payments of thirty-three dollars , or less , at 5 per cent interest , over a period of twenty years . He would paste the label " Crackpot " on you and your project . And he would be right , in a sense . Yet Cali-fornia 's board has been doing exactly this since 1929 . A number of important factors contributed to the hoard 's success , but none weighed so heavily as simple " good buying , " which means hard-boiled buying . The board proceeded from the established fact that more commercial failures result from foggy-headed buying than from anything else . It went on to recognize @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has cost investors millions in losses , in good years as well as bad , because it is a highly illusory and transitory commodity . You may buy new car in Detroit , drive it to New York or Los Angeles , and it will retain a market value that does not vary $150 . But in a thousand communities in the United States you can build two identical houses only a mile apart , and before they are even completed they will differ 50 per cent in market value . The board would not permit a veteran to buy a house that was not a proved-up good buy . Fundamentally , the California State Veterans ' Welfare Board was and is a merchandising organization , buying homes for resale to eligible veterans . Its only operating margin is a 5 per cent administrative charge , plus the rate at which it can borrow money , and the 5 per cent interest charged the veteran . True , it has no taxes to pay on its holdings , but , to offset this , the board is supposed to operate on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ postage and incidentals from its slim operating margin . Unfortunately , the average home buyer thinks only in terms of the house itself . Hundreds of homes are sold each year because Mrs. Jones likes the bathroom color scheme , the children prefer the school district , or several congenial pinochle players reside near by . If any expert is consulted , be is a carpenter , builder or architect . Perhaps one time in a hundred , a real-estate dealer is called in to give his opinion as to the neighborhood . Even banks and insurance companies lending millions upon real estate have , until fairly recently , contented themselves with casual horseback appraisals . The result was the writing off of millions of dollars in depreciated mortgages during the depression . Contrast this innocence with the truculent attitude of the California board when it spends $5000 for a home from which it must get every penny back in twenty years with 5 per cent interest . On the board 's standard fee-appraisal blank there are eighty-seven numbered lines with highly relevant questions , and it is significant that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remaining sixty lines are devoted to questions about which not one home buyer or mortgage lender in a thousand ever concerns himself . Let us accompany a fee appraiser to the home which Mr. Average California Veteran has submitted for purchase . Brand-now or twenty years old , the property will have to run the gantlet . Lines 1 to 10 on the fee-appraisal blank are simple . But then we come to the next ten lines about the district or neighborhood . Is its principal use residential , apartment. , business , rooming house or industrial ? Is it the best , good or poor residential district , and is the trend static , up or down ? Is the transition to business , to apartment or to industry ? What is the apparent annual rate ? Is the section old , now or congested ? What percentage of the section is built up ? These questions deal with one of the fundamentals of real estate . It is an old axiom that a static or stagnant neighborhood means a stagnant market and values , with the ultimate trend inevitably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neighborhood , at least until it is 90 per cent built up . Whatever the speculative possibilities , a district in transition to business , apartments or industry can only be shunned by prudent ? home buyers . Is it in the city limits ? if not , has it police and fire protection , and how far is it from the city boundary ? How many blocks will the children have to walk to grammar school ? High school ? Stores ? Bus ? Car line ? Elevated or subway ? What percentage of the residents are Negro , foreign , Oriental ? Elementary ? But hundreds of folks have been sold homes they believed were within city limits . An inaccessible school means constant rows with Junior , extra carfares , or the family ear turned into a school bus . A neighborhood grocery ten blocks away is no joke when Aunt Lena drops in for lunch . And now comes that real sleeper previously mentioned ? " new public improvements authorized . " Just because you do n't see the street torn up , does not mean that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nice big bill for improvements authorized before you bought your home . Since the war , special assessments , improvements taxes , street bonds , or call them what you will , have proved a far greater burden and menace in many communities than the ordinary annual tax levy . Beware of special assessments . Not even churches are exempt from them . To Rucid Future Headaches E VERY ONE who buys anything must someday consider selling it . What is the marketability of the home under consideration ? Is it likely to be readily salable ? Which brings us to the subject of land values , another factor usually overlooked . What is the lot size ? Steep or level ? Are sidewalks in and paid for , or will that he another lien against the future ? Is the street paved , paid for ? Any alley , and is it paved ? How about electricity , gas , sewer , cesspool , city water ? Take none of these things for granted , for some of the best residential sections of some cities have no sewers . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ single-family residences , duplexes , apartments , business , light industry and heavy industry . If the restrictions have expired or are about to expire , tread softly . Some morning you will wake up and discover Neighbor Smith remodeling his home into a duplex or wrecking it for a garage site . Scout the neighborhood for signs of encroachments . A home beauty shop down the street may be very convenient for the misses , but you will pay a tremendous bill later in quickened property depreciation . A sparsely built up district does not necessarily mean zoning for single-family residences . Today , in several California cities , districts which were miles from nowhere only five or six years ago are zoned for apartments . If you are dickering for a lot , look for deed restrictions . Perhaps you will be limited to building a $10,000 home instead of the bungalow you planned . Set-back lines or lack of them also can cause many a headache . What about easements , common-user agreements , joint driveways , and so on ? They all offer excellent possibilities for expensive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ determining land value , remember that this has nothing to do with the house itself . Determine what would be the present price obtainable for the site , if vacant , by pricing near-by vacant lots . If prices are inflated , the present justified value will be a lower figure ; seldom should it be higher . For later computation , we will put down $1000 for this lot , or twenty dollars per front foot . Only now are we ready to consider the house . What is its architecture  --  Monterey , Colonial , English cottage , or just a hodgepodge ? Is the roof wood shingles , composition , slate , tile or perhaps copper ? Even new roofs of every type will leak , especially if cheap flashing has been used . Is this sheet-metal work of copper , galvanized iron or just tin ? Have the wood shingles been stained or painted to preserve them ? Has the house been remodeled , and if so , why , and how effectively ? Is the exterior frame , frame stucco , brick , stone , adobe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or brick , and has it been pierced to provide ventilation as a deterrent against termites ? Test the cement or mortar with a knife or ice pick . Entering the house , we will first go to the last place the average buyer turns his attention , if ever  --  the basement . Are there any finished rooms ? What about the heating system ? If it is a gas or oil furnace , look for the little aluminum plate telling the B.T.U. rating , for you will get no more heat than the British thermal unit capacity . Is the furnace of standard make ? If the house is new , what provision has been made for air conditioning ? Now we go back to those overalls and crawl under the house . Simply to work out on the joist with an ice pick is not enough . Are the joists 2 x 6 , 2 x 8 , 2 x 10 or 2 x 12 ? Are they braced ? Are they a maximum of sixteen inches ' apart , as many cities require ? Have they been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ joists rest upon 4 x 4 girders , 4 x 6 ' 8 , or concrete bearing walls , and how great is the span ? If the joists are only 2 x 6 's , this span should not exceed six feet , or sooner or later you will have sagging floors . Is the subflooring one inch THE SATURDAY thick and laid diagonally to eliminate squeaks , or the newer two-inch tongue-and-groove ? Tiresome , hot and dirty work , with plenty of cobwebs , but it pays big dividends . Now we can go upstairs . Is the closet space adequate ? Look carefully for stained ceilings . They and plaster cracks usually mean roof leaks . Is the electric wiring in metal conduits now required in many cities , and are there ample outlets ? What about the floor plan ? Is it good , acceptable or just a hodgepodge of wasted space ? Are the floors hardwood throughout and are they at least one-half inch thick ? Will they need refinishing soon ? Are the walls interior stucco , plaster or wallpaper ? Has the fireplace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Measure the space for your mechanical refrigerator and check on the necessary electric or gas connections . Weather strips are important , and imperative for in-swing casement windows . Plumbing is of vital consideration . Are the fixtures standard and is there adequate tile in the kitchen and bath , especially in the shower ? Was brass , galvanized iron or wrought-iron pipe used ? Better have your own plumber check all fittings for leaks and roof vents . Unless the house is brand-new , compute liberally exterior and interior repairs . Now we wilt take a tape line and measure the building size . With additions or subtractions for offsets , the length multiplied by width gives us the total number of square feet , say 1300 ? a fair average for a two-bedroom house . Most building costs today are figured on at so much per square foot . If comparable construction in your community is $3.25 per square foot , multiply by 1300 to obtain today 's reproduction cost of the house . But this dwelling happens to be four years old . It . has had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depreciation estimate of 21 z per cent annually , or 10 per cent of $4225 , which is $422 . Subtract and we have $3803 , which is the depreciated reproduction cost , or the real value of the house today . But wait ; we have overlooked the garage . Unless it is at least 18 x 18 feet , two cars are likely to be a tight squeeze . If you live in a cold climate , what about garage heat ? Is the floor concrete or just rock and sand ? If attached to the house , is the partition plastered and was metal lath or brick used as a fire-break ? A fair depreciated reproduction cost for a four-year-old garage is $175 . Add that to the $3803 for the house , and we have $3978 . The Real Value of a House We now consider the rental value of the property . Are vacancies of this type in the district few , many or excessive ? Can this house be readily rented at prevailing rents in this district ? If it is now rented , what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rental unfurnished for normal times ? What would be an average reasonable monthly rental , unfurnished , for the past ten years ? Certainly forty dollars per month seems about right . EVENING POST Can we estimate the real value of this property ? First , what is the present market price , obtainable within ninety days for cash , which is something entirely different from the asking price of the owner ? Put down $4500 . Then we take the land value of the lot , estimated back in Question No. 29 at $1000 ; add to it the depreciated reproduction cost of house and garage , and we have a second value estimate of $4978 . The third , or capitalized , value is based upon the average rental . Our estimate was forty dollars per month , which we multiply by 100 , and get $4000 . The combined total of our three estimates is $13,478 . Divide by three , and our final figure is $4492 . But surely something is wrong , for Mr. Average Veteran has been assured that this property is a " steal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $4500 is about what the state of California will offer , with all repairs to be made by seller , plus escrow and title-insurance charges . In eight cases out of ten , the offer will be accepted . No wonder the veteran has every incentive to pay out his **29;1092;TOOLONG contract on this deal , for he has obtained a home on long credit terms at cash prices . Until his equity exceeds the *1000 California veterans ' property exemption , he will have no taxes . Perhaps Mr. Average Veteran is unable to find , already built , a house he likes , as has generally been the case since distress real estate went off the market early in 1936 . Then the procedure becomes more complicated , for the board deals only in completed houses and advances no money during construction . Here we have what many veterans insist is the fly in the ointment . They assert , with some justification , that hundreds of qualified veterans have given up hope of getting a house because their builders found it impossible to obtain temporary construction loans . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having contractors build for them . On the other hand , had the board adventured into the hazardous construction-loan business , with its headaches over inspections , material and labor liens and builders clamoring for money , it probably would be insolvent today . The critics forget that life-insurance companies lending millions of dollars annually upon real estate make comparatively few construction loans . But how does the board take care of the veteran desiring to build ? In most cases , the builder contracts with the veteran to finance and build an agreed-upon house under the board 's rigid specifications . If the builder is dubious about pleasing the board , the veteran can file plans and specifications prepared by a licensed architect , have them and his building site approved , and ask the board to issue a commitment to purchase the proposed house F  --  braary 90 , r937 upon satisfactory completion . Because most financial institutions and private inoneylendersmaking construction loans insist upon this protection , a vast ma-Jor.ltY of new homes are built under this commitment plan . But does not this involve expensive inspections just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In theory it does , but there is a lot of difference between inspecting a house and then advancing the contractor hundreds of dollars for the work done , compared with a routine inspection in which the board retains the right to veto or accept the completed house . In actual practice , the board 's inspectors look over construction , approve or object to what has been done , and come back several weeks later for the next inspection . If the contractor refuses to play ball , he will have a rejected house on his hands , commitment or no commitment . For California 's Veterans The board 's commitments really do n't mean a thing legally . Scores of homes built under the commitment plan have been finally rejected because of cheap lumber , poor workmanship , shoddy concrete , lack of eighteen inches clearance under floor joists , makeshift plastering or other attributes of the jerrybuilder. - That is why some of the better contractors prefer to save architect 's fees , delays for inspections and other red tape , and go ahead building a house which they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California veteran get in a new home for the $5000 the state invests for him ? Until building costs soared a few months ago , scores of Los Angeles veterans received three bedrooms , a bath and a half , gas unit heat , double garage , on a minimum fifty-foot lot . Some veterans with clear lots or additional capital up to $2500 maximum , are living in state homes today comparable to $15,000 houses in Eastern cities , Some of these more elaborate residences have air conditioning , a basement game room , a complete private bath with shower for each bedroom , or even a bar or outdoor swimming pool . Naturally , because of the additional margin of security , there is a tendency to wink at even a $10,000 home , if the veteran has the $5000 additional cash . At the other extreme is the economically handicapped veteran whose home may mean only a $3000 investment by the state . And now , I very much suspect , there is a question that you have been wanting to ask for quite a while : How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and how did the state manage to skirt political and financial shoals ? First , the 1921 California legislators who enacted the State Veterans ' Welfare Board Farm and Home Purchase Act showed not only foresight but recognized that human flesh is exceptionally weak in the vicinity of a pork barrel . They first gave the Veterans ' Welfare Board absolute authority to administer the housing program , as a substitute for a cash World War bonus from the state . Then they stipulated that , before any farm or home was purchased for a veteran , the property must be viewed by a salaried appraiser employed by the board , by a fee appraiser having no financial interest in the property , and finally by an appraiser for a national bank doing business in California  --  three hard-boiled buyers . Thus , before a dime was available for spending , collusion and politics were eliminated so far as was humanly possible . At times political pressure from interests which objected to the intense microscopic examination of the houses purchased became intense . Occasionally , an undesirable house slipped by . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . A 1935 act which placed all salaried employees under civil service helped to strengthen morale . Then , too , the three major veterans ' organizations , and especially the American Legion , with nearly 100,000 members in California , have kept a vigilant eye upon this enterprise , in marked contrast to the usual public apathy as to how a governmental board spends taxpayers ' money . Limiting the state 's investment to $5000 in a home and $7500 for a farm helped to spread the risks . Veterans with $5000 or more in real estate were excluded , on the theory that they needed no help in acquiring a borne . Fortunately , farms played an unimportant part in the program , 514 farms to 14,596 homes . These 514 farms contributed fifty-three resales to the 1934 liquidation of delinquents , and a net loss of $13,214.05 . Another favorable factor was the restriction of the program to one group  --  California war veterans , with only veterans administering it , thus creating a bond of common interest , sympathy and understanding . Any favoritism or laxity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In appointing the chief executive of this enterprise , who holds the title of chairman of the board , with an annual salary of $6000 , four governors of California exercised exceptional judgment . The present chairman , named last March by Governor Merriam , is John R. Quinn , a past national commander of the American Legion , and a Los Angeles County supervisor from 1932 to 1936 . Here we have not only knowledge and influence in veteran circles but executive experience in the government of a county that is third in the United States in annual expenditures . His immediate predecessor was Thomas M. Foley , a leader of the San Francisco bar , and now a municipal judge in that city . The other members of the board , serving without salary , are Richard J. Welch , Jr. , of Riverside ; Hugo Harris , of Los Angeles ; Thomas M. Carlson , of Richmond ; and Otto E. Sandman , of Stockton . Keeping the Project Solvent The program got off to a slow start . It was not until 1924 that the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $80,000,000 worth of bonds authorized to date by California voters to finance the venture tells its own story . The maximum interest rate was 43 per cent , and the lowest , 2j ' per cent for a $3,000,000 issue sold on January 7 , 1937 . The average interest rate is slightly under 4 per cent ; more than $7,000,000 worth of these bonds already has been redeemed , with total interest paid to date in excess of $12 , - 000,000 . A vital factor in keeping the project . solvent during the critical years of 1930-34 , was the thirty-three dollars per month , or less , payments required from veterans making farm or home purchases . Thousands of homes had been sold by private concerns from 1924 toi 1930 calling for monthly payments double or even triple the demoralized rentals of these depression years , but it was a rare Veterans ' Welfare Board home that could not command at least thirty dollars a month rent even in 1933 . Despite this favorable rental situation , delinquencies began mounting in the summer of 1931 , and by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ January 1 , 1934 , there was $1,000,000 worth of red ink on the books , and the percentage of delinquencies stood at 29.54 per cent . Disaster seemed inevitable , but the board met the situation with firm common sense instead of political expediency . Fifteen hundred and nineteen home and farm purchase contracts were rewritten but none were scaled down . Six hundred and four properties were rented to canceled-contract holders ; 936 houses were rented to new tenants , and 736 were resold at a net gain of $7722.88 . By June 30 , 1934 , the $1,000,000 in delinquencies had been reduced  --  in six months ? to $300 , - 000 . On December 15 , 1936 , it was down to $89,510.16 . Bad Risks Eliminated Today the board is in a stronger financial position than many of our forty-eight states . For how many states could sell in March , 1936 , $5,000,000 worth of bonds bearing only 2 , i per cent interest , at a premium of il $118,850 ? Within sound economic and architectural safeguards , 15,100 California veterans have had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with a building standard as high as any in the country . Until the $30,000,000 bond issue in November , 1934 , there was not enough money even to begin to go round . Seven thousand veterans became disgusted with the delay , but 15,000 waited patiently until their numbered application receipt card was reached and the state of California was ready to say , in effect : " Come into the nearest office of your board in Sacramento , San Francisco , Oakland , Fresno or Los Angeles , for an interview to determine whether you are qualified to have your fellow taxpayers loan $5000 to you for a home . " These interviews were anything but perfunctory . The goats were ruthlessly separated from the sheep . Fifteen hundred veterans were disqualified for not having been the bona-fide residents of California prior to enlistment they hoped they were . Another fifteen hundred were rejected for having no dependents . Nearly 500 veterans without previous farm experience were told to satisfy their yearning for the great outdoors at their own expense . In this manner nearly 5000 applicants have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who , after being approved , refused to co-operate , died , or voluntarily surrendered their rights , and there is a total of 12,000 . Multiply 12,000 by $5000 and you have eliminated a $60,000,000 potential investment , or almost as much as has been spent since 1924.
