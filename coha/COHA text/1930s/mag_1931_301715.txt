Combined sales of military and commercial aircraft in the first six months of 1931 gained $85,703 over sales in the first six months of 1930 , the Aeronautical Chamber of Commerce reported last week . Planes and engines valued at $19,618,043 were sold by manufacturers in the first half of 1931 as compared to $19,532,340 in the same period last year . Sales of commercial aircraft declined sharply but a 57.8% increase in sales of military aircraft more than made up the difference . Production of commercial planes slumped even lower than sales in the first six months of 1931-42.9% lower than last year .
