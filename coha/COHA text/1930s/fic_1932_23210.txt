GAL YOUNG UN A STORY IN TWO PARTS PART I BY MARJORIE KINNAN RAWLINGS T HE house was invisible from the road which wound , almost untraveled. through the flat-woods . Once every five days a turpentine wagon creaked down the ruts , and negroes moved like shadows among the pines . A few hunters in season came upon them chipping boxes , scraping aromatic gum from red pots into encrusted buckets ; inquired the way and whether quail or squirrel or turkey had been seen . Then hunters and turpentiners moved again along the road , stepping on violets and yellow pitcher-plants that rimmed the edges . The negroes were aware of the house . It stood a few hundred yards away , hidden behind two live oaks , isolated and remote in a patch of hammock . It was a tall square two-stories . The woman who gave them water from her well when the nearby branch was dry looked to them like the house , tall and bare and lonely , weathered gray , like its unpainted cypress . She seemed forgotten . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not remember  --  if they had ever known  --  that a dwelling stood here . Flushing a covey of quail that flung themselves like feathered bronze discs at the cover of the hammock , their first shots flicked through the twin oaks . They followed their pointer dog on the trail of single birds and stopped short in amazement . Entering the north fringe of the hammock , they had come out on a sandy open yard . A woman was watching them from the back stoop of an old house . " Shootin ' mighty close , men , " she called . Her voice sounded unused , like a rusty iron hinge . The older man whistled in the dog , ranging feverishly in the low palmettos . The younger swaggered to the porch . He pushed back the black slouch hat from his brazen eyes . " Never knowed nobody lived in six miles o ' here . " His tone was insolent . He drew a flattened package of cigarettes from his corduroy hunting jacket , lighted one , and waited for her to begin scolding . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this one , quarreled earnestly ; young ones snapped at him playfully . " It 's a Iong ways from anybody , ai n't it ? " she agreed . He stared at her between puffs . " Jesus , yes . " " I do n't keer about you shootin ' , " she said . " It 's purely sociable , hearin ' men-folks acrost the woods . A shot come the a winder jest now , that 's all the reason I spoke . " The intruders shifted their shotguns uneasily . The older man touched his finger to his cap . " That 's all right , ma'am . " His companion strolled to the stone curbing of an open well . He peered into its depths , shimmering where the sun of high noon struck vertically . " Good water ? " " The finest ever . Leave rue fetch you a clean cup . " She turned into the house for a white china coffee cup . The men wound up a bucket of water on creaking ropes . The older man drank politely from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bucket . He reared back his head like a satisfied hound , dripping a stream of crystal drops from his red mouth . " Ai n't your dog thirsty ? Here  --  reckon my ol ' cat wo n't fuss if he drinks outen his dish . " The woman stroked the animal 's flanks as he lapped . " Ai n't he a fine feller . " The hunters began to edge away . " Men , I jest got common rations , bacon an ' biscuit an coffee , but you 're plumb welcome to set down with me . " " No , thank you , ma'am . " They looked at the sun . " Got to be mosey-in ' home . " The younger man was already on his way , sucking a straw . The other fumbled in his game-pocket . " Sorry we come so clost up on you , lady . How ' bout a bird fer your dinner ? " She reached out a large hand for the quail . " I 'd shore thank you fer it . I 'm a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ git ' em roosted . Birds is hard without no dog to point ' em . I gits hungry fer quail . . Her voice trailed off as the hunters walked through the pines toward the road . She waved her hand in case they should turn around . They did not look back . The man was hunting alone because he had been laughed at . His cronies inthe Florida village , to which he had returned after a few years ' wandering , knew that he detested solitude . It was alien to him , a silent void into which he sank as into quicksand . He had stopped at the general store to pick up a hunting partner . The men lounging there hours at a time were usually willing to go with him . This time none was ready . " Come go with me , Willy , " he insisted . " I cai n't go by myself . " The storekeeper called over his shoulder , weighing out a quarter 's worth of water-ground meal for a negro . You 'll git ketched out alone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wo n't know who ' t is . " The men guffawed . " Trax always gut to git him a buddy . " His smoldering eyes flared at them . He spat furiously across the rough pine floor of the store . " I ai n't got to git me none o ' these sorry catbirds . " He had clattered down the wooden steps , spitting angrily every few feet . They were jealous , he thought , because he had been over on the east coast . He had turned instinctively down the south road out of the village . Old man Blaine had brought him this way last week . He hunted carelessly for two or three hours , taking pot shots at several coveys that rose under his feet . His anger made him miss the birds widely . It was poor sport without a companion and a dog . Now he realized that he was lost . As a boy he had hunted these woods , but always with other boys and men . He had gone through them unseeing , stretching his young muscles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face at every running branch . His shooting had been careless , avid . He liked to see the brown birds tumble in midair . He liked to hunt with the pack , to gorge on the game dinners they cooked by lake shores under oak trees . When the group turned homeward , he followed , thinking of supper ; of the ' shine his old man kept hidden in the smokehouse ; of the girls he knew . Someone else knew north and south , and the cross patterns of the piney-woods roads . The lonely region was now as unfamiliar as though he had been a stranger . It was an hour or two past noon . He leaned his 1l-gauge shotgun against a pine and looked about him nervously . He knew by the sun that he had come continuously south . He had crossed and recrossed the road , and could not decide whether it now lay to the right or left . If he missed it to the right , he would come to cypress swamp . He licked his lips . If he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bring him out a couple of miles above the village . That would be better . He could always get a lift back . He picked up his gun and began to walk . In a few minutes a flat gray surface flashed soddenly from a patch of hammock . He stopped short . Pleasure swept over him , cooling his hot irritation . He recognized the house where he and Blaine had drawn water . He had cursed Blaine for giving a quail to the woman . He wiped the sweat from his face . The woman would feed him and direct him out of the flat-woods . Instinctively he changed his gait from a shuffling drag to his customary swagger . He rapped loudly on the smooth cypress front door . It had a half-moon fanlight over it . The house was old but it was capacious and good . There was , for all its bareness , an air of prosperity . Clean white curtains hung at the windows . A striped cat startled him by rearing against his legs . He kicked it away . The woman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . be-yond the high piazza . He turned . The woman was stalking around the side of the house to see before she was seen . Her gray face lightened as she recognized him . She laughed . " Mister , if you knowed how long it 's been since I heerd a rap . Do n't nobody knock on my front door . The turpentine niggers calls so 's I wo n't shoot , and the hunters comes a-talkin ' to the well . " She climbed the front steps with the awkwardness of middle age . She dried a hand on her flour-sacking apron and held it out to him He took it limply , interrupting the talk that began to flow from her . He was ugly with hunger and fatigue and boredom . " How ' bout a mess o ' them rations you was offerin ' me last week ? " His impatience was tempered with the tone of casual intimacy in which he spoke to all women . It bridged time and space . The woman flushed . " I 'd be mighty well pleased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sill , and she threw a strong body against it . He did not offer to help . He strolled in ahead of her . As she apologized for the moments it would take to fry bacon and make coffee , he was already staring about him at the large room . When she came to him from the kitchen half an hour later , her face red with her hurry , the room had made an impress on his mind , as roads and forests could not do . The size of the room , of the clay fireplace , the adequacy of chairs and tables of a frontier period , the luxury of a Brussels carpet , although ancient , over wood , the plenitude of polished , unused kerosene lamps ? the details lay snugly in his mind like hoarded money . Hungry , with the smell of hot food filling his breath , he took time to smooth his sleek black hair at a walnut-framed mirror on the varnished match-board wall . He made his toilet boldly in front of the woman . A close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands moving over his affectation of clipped side-burns , could only show her that he was good to look at . He walked to the kitchen with a roll , sprawling his long legs under the table . With the first few mouthfuls of food good humor returned to him . He indulged himself in graciousness . The woman served him lavishly with fried cornbread and syrup , coffee , white bacon in thick slices , and fruits and vegetables of her own canning . His gluttony delighted her . His mouth was full , bent low over his heaped plate . " You live fine , ma'am , for anyone lives plumb alone . " She sat down opposite him , wiping back the wet gray hair from her forehead , and poured herself a convivial cup of coffee . " Jim  --  that was my husband  --  an ' Pa always did say if they was good rations in the house they 'd orter be on the table . I ai n't got over the habit . " " You been livin ' alone quite some time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bout six . " " Do n't you never go nowheres ? " " I got no way to go . I kep ' up stock fer two-three year after Pa died , but ' twa' n't wuth the worry . They 's a family lives two mile closer to town than me , has a horse an ' wagon . I take ' em my List o ' things ' bout oncet month . Seems like . . . " He scarcely listened . A change of atmosphere in her narrative indicated suddenly to him that she was asking him about himself . " You a stranger ? " She was eager , leaning on the table waiting for his answer . He finished a saucer of preserved figs , scraping at the rich syrup with relish . He tilted back in his chair luxuriously and threw the match from his cigarette in the general direction of the wood stove . He was entirely at home . His belly well filled with good food , his spirit touched with the unfailing intoxication to him of a woman 's interest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his deeds , his dangers . " You ever heard the name o ' Trax Colton ? " She shook her head . He tapped his chest significantly , nodding at her . " That 's me . You 've heard tell , if you on'y remembered , o ' me leavin ' here a few years back on account of a little cuttin ' fuss . I been on the east coast  --  Daytona , Melbourne , all them places . The fuss blowed over an ' I come back . Fixin ' to take up business here . " He frowned importantly . He tapped a fresh cigarette on the table , as he had learned to do from his companions of the past years . He thought with pleasure of all that he had learned , of the sophistication that lay over his Cracker speech and ways like a cheap bright coat . " I 'm an A-1 bootlegger , ma'am . " For the time being he was a big operator from the east coast . He told her of small sturdy boats from Cuba , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of the stream of swift automobiles moving in and out just before high tide . Her eyes shone . She plucked at the throat of her brown-checked gingham dress , breathing quickly . It was fitting that this dark glamorous young man should belong to the rocket-lit world of danger . It was ecstasy painful in its sharpness , that he should be tilted back at her table , flicking his fragrant ashes on her clean , lonely floor . He was entirely amiable as he left her . Pleased with himself , he was for a moment pleased with her . She was a good woman . He laid his hand patronizingly on her shoulder . He stroked the striped cat on his way down the steps . This time he turned to lift his hand to her . She waved heartily as long as his lithe body moved in sight among the pines . An impulse took her to the mirror where he had smoothed his hair , as though it would bring him within her vision again . She saw herself completely for the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had forgotten until this moment that she was no longer young . She turned from the mirror and washed the dishes soberly . It occurred to her that the young man had not even asked her name . The hammock that had been always a friendly curtain about the old house was suddenly a wall . The flat-woods that had been sunny and open , populous with birds and the voice of winds , grew dense and dark . She had been solitary . She had grieved for Jim and for the old man her father . But solitude had kept her company in a warm natural way , sitting cozily at her hearth , like the cat . Now loneliness washed intolerably over her , as though she were drowning in a cold black pond . The young man 's complacency lasted a mile or two . As his feet began to drag , fact intruded on the fiction with which he had enraptured the gray-haired woman . Memories seeped back into him like a poison : memories of the lean years as ignorant hanger-on of prosperous bootleggers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shine in ignominious pints . The world for which he considered himself fitted had evaded him . His condition was desperate . He thought of the woman who had fed him , whom he had entranced with his story . Distaste for her flooded him , as though it was her fault the story was a lie . He lifted his shotgun and blew the head from a redbird trilling in a wild plum tree . The storekeeper in the village was the only person who recognized Mattie Syles . The store was packed with the Saturday-night buyers of rations . A layer of whites milled in front of the meat counter ; a layer of blacks shifted behind them . At the far grocery counter along a side wall a wedge of negroes had worked in toward the meal and sugar barrels , where helpers weighed out the dimes ' and quarters ' worth with deliberately inaccurate haste . Two white women were buying percale of the storekeeper 's wife at the dry-goods counter . The woman came in defiantly , as though the store was a shameful place where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to side . The storekeeper 's wife called , " Evenin ' , ma'am , " and the two white women wheeled to stare and whisper after her . She advanced toward the meat counter . The negroes parted to let her in . The storekeeper poised his knife over a pork backbone to look at her . He laid it down , wiped his hands with a flourish on his front , and shook hands across the counter . " If this ai n't a surprise ! Must be four-five years since you been to town ! Meat I been sendin ' you by Lantry 's been all right ? What kin I do fer you ? Butchered this mornin ' ? got fresh beef , How ' bout a nice thin steak ? " She made her purchases slowly and moved to the staples counter . She insisted on being left until the last . " I ai n't in no hurry . " The store was almost empty and ready to close when she gathered her sacks together and climbed into the Lantry 's wagon , waiting outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they moved off she did not notice that the man she had hoped desperately to see was just strolling into the store . " Gim me a couple o ' packs o ' Camels to tide me over Sunday . " " Fifteen cents straight now , Trax . " " Jest one , then . " The storekeeper spoke across the vacant store to his wife , rolling up the bolts of cloth . " Edna , you have better manners with the customers , or we 'll be losing ' em . Why' n't you take up some time with Mis ' Syles ? " " ' Who ? " " Mis ' Syles  --  Jim Syles ' widder or man Terry 's daughter  --  lives four-five mile south , out beyond Lantry 's . You know her , Edna . Lantry 's been buyin ' fer her . " " I never knowed her . How 'd I know her now ? Why' n't you call her by name , so 's I 'd of knowed ? " " Well , you keep better track of her if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town agin . She 's rich . " Trax turned in the doorway . " You talkin ' about that gank-gutted woman left jest now ? " He had avoided going into the store until she left . He had not intended to bring her volubility upon him in public , have her refer to their meal together . He had half-guessed she had come looking for him . Women did . " She live alone in a two-story house you cai n't see from the road ? " " That 's her , " the storekeeper agreed . " That 's Mis ' Syles , a'right . " " She 's rich ? " " I mean rich . Got her five dollars a week steady rent-money from turpentine , an ' three thousand dollars insurance in the bank her daddy left her . An ' then lives ' tother end o ' nowhere . Wo n't leave the old house . " " ' Bout time somebody was fixin ' to marry all that , goin ' to waste . " " She would n't suit you , Trax @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You been used to ' em younger an ' purtier . " The man Colton was excited . He walked out of the store without the customary " Well , evenin ' " of departure . He hurried to Blaine 's , where he was boarding , but did not go in . It was necessary to sit alone on the bench outside and think . His luck had not deserted him . As he leaned his dark head back against the wall , the tropical stars glittering over him were the bright lights of city streets . Here and there a fat star flickered . These were the burnished kerosene lamps of the widow Syles . The big room  --  the fireplace that would heat it on the coolest nights  --  one by one he drew out the remembered details and tucked them into his plans . The man courted the woman with the careless impatience of his quail hunting . He intended to be done with it as quickly as possible . There was , astonishingly , a certain pleasure in her infatuation . He responded to any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fire , stretching comfortably before it . The maternal lavishness of her emotion for him was satisfying . Younger women , pretty women , expected something of him , coaxed and coquetted . On his several visits to the widow before he condescended to be married to her , he sprawled in the early spring nights before the big fireplace . He made it plain that he was not one to sit around the kitchen stove . His fastidiousness charmed her . She staggered into the room with her generous arms heaped with wood : live oak and hickory , and some cedar chips , because Trax liked the smell . From his chair he directed the placing of the heavy logs . A fire must crackle constantly to please him . She learned to roll cigarettes for him , bringing them to him to lick flickeringly , like a snake , with his quick tongue . The process stirred her . When she placed the finished cigarette between his lips and lighted it with a blazing lighter 'd splinter ; when he puffed languidly on I it and half-closed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , she shivered . The courting was needlessly protracted because she could not believe that he would have her . it was miracle enough that he should be here at all in these remote flat-woods . It was unbelievable that he should be willing to prolong the favor , to stay with her in this place forever . She said , " Cai n't be you raly wants me . " Yet she drank in his casual insistence . " Why not ? Ai n't a thing the matter with you . " She understood sometimes  --  when she wakened with a clear mind in the middle of the night  --  that something strange bad happened to her . She was moving in a delirium , like the haze of malaria when the fever was on . She solaced herself by thinking that Trax too might be submerged in such a delicious fog . When he left her one night in the Blaine Ford he had borrowed , the retreating explosions of the car left behind a silence that terrified her . She ran to the beginning of the pines @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the south wind in the needles . There was no light but the endless flickering of stars . She knew that if the man did not come back again she would have to follow him . Solitude she had endured . She could not endure desolation . When he came the next day she was ready to go to the village with him to the preacher . He laughed easily at her hurry and climbed ahead of her into the borrowed car . He drove zestfully , with abandon , bouncing the woman 's big frame over the ruts of the dirt road . As they approached the village he said casually , " I keep my money in Clark City . We 'd orter do our business together . Where 's yours ? " " Mine 's there too . Some 's in the post office an ' some in the bank . " " Supposin ' we go git married there . An ' reckon you kin lend me a hundred till I add up my account ? " She nodded an assent to both questions . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Trax , if you ai n't got it real free to spend . " She was alarmed for his interests . " You leave me pay fer things a while . " He drew a deep breath of relief . He was tempted for a moment to get her cash and head for the east coast at once . But he had made his plans to stay . He needed the old house in the safe flat-woods to make his start . He could even use the woman . When they came back through the village from the city she stopped at the store for supplies . The storekeeper leaned across the fresh sausage to whisper confidentially : " Tai n't my business , Mis ' Syles , but folks is sayin ' Trax Colton is sort o ' courtin ' you . You come of good stock , an ' you 'd orter step easy . Trax is purely trash , Mis ' Syles . " She looked at him without comprehension . She said , " Me an ' Trax is married . " The gray of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The walls were washed with its thin gold . The ferns and lichens of the shingled roof were shot through with light , and the wren 's nest under the eaves was luminous . The striped cat sprawled flattened on the rear stoop , exposing his belly to the soft warmth . The woman moved quietly at her work , for fear of awakening the man . She was washing . When she drew a bucket of water from the well she steadied it with one hand as it swung to the coping , so that there should be no sound . Near the well stood bamboo and oleander . She left her bucket to draw her fingers along the satin stoutness of the fresh green bamboo shoots , to press apart the new buds of the oleander in search of the pale pinkness of the first blossoms . The sun lay like a friendly arm across her square shoulders . It seemed to her that she had been chilled , year on year , and that now for the first time she was warmed through to her marrow . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the bed after her solitude . . . . When she finished her washing she slipped in to look at him . A boyish quiet wiped out the nervous shiftiness of his waking expression . She wanted to gather him up , sleeping , in her strong arms and hold him against her capacious breast . When his breakfast was almost ready , she made a light clatter in the kitchen . It irritated him to be called . He liked to get up of his own accord and find breakfast smoking , waiting for him . He came out gaping , washed his face and hands in the granite basin on the water-shelf , combed his hair leisurely at the kitchen mirror , turning his face this way and that . Matt stood watching him , twisting her apron . When he was quite through , she came to him and laid her cheek against his . " Mornin ' , Trax-honey . " Her voice was vibrant . " Mornin ' . " He yawned again as he dropped into his chair . He beat lightly on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He scowled . " Where 's the bacon ? " " Honey , I did n't think you 'd want none with the squirrel an ' eggs an ' fish . " " My God , I cai n't eat breakfast without bacon . " " I 'm sorry , Trax . ' Two n't take me but a minute now . " She was miserable because she had not fried bacon and he wanted it . He slid eggs and meat and biscuits to his plate , poured coffee with an angry jerk , so that it spilled on the table , shoveled the food in , chewing with his mouth open . When Matt put the crisp thick slices of white bacon before him , he did not touch them . He lighted a cigarette and strolled to the stoop , pushing off the cat so that he might sit down . He leaned back and absorbed the sun . This was fine . He had deliberately allowed himself these few idle weeks . He had gone long without comfort . His body needed it . His swaggering spirit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He could have had no greater sense of well-being , of affluence if she had been a nigger servant . Now he was ready for business . His weasel mind was gnawing its hole into the world he longed for . " Matt ! " She left her dishes and came to stand over him . " Matt , you 're goin ' in business with me . I want you should git me three hundred dollars . I want to set up a eight-barrel still back o ' the house , down by the branch . " Trax had crashed like a meteor into the flat-woods . It had not occurred to her that his world must follow him That was detached from him , only a strange story that he had told . She had a sensation of dismay that any thing , any person , must intrude on her ecstasy . She said anxiously , " I got enough to make out on , Trax . You do n't need to go startin ' up nothin ' like that . " " All right  --  if you want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , no . Do n't you do that . Do n't you go ' way . I did n't know you was studyin ' on nothin ' like that  --  you jest go ahead an ' put it elost as you like . " " Down by the branch , like I said . " He visioned the lay-out for her She listened , distraught . The platform here , for the barrels of mash . There , the wood-pile for the slow fire . Here again , the copper still itself . The cover was dense , utterly concealing . The location was remote . " The idee , Matt , " he was hunched forward , glowing , " is to sell yer own stuff what they call retail , see ? It costs you fifty , seventy-five cents a gallon to make . You sell by the five-gallon jug fer seven dollars , like they 're doin ' nuw , you do n't make nothin ' . That 's nigger pay .

" It was as though thunder and lightning threatened over the fiat-woods . The darkness of impending violence filled them . She stared at him . " ' Course , if you do n't want to invest in my business with me , I got to be gittin ' back where I come from . " The smoke from his cigarette drifted across her . " No , no ! It 's all right ! " His glamorousness enfolded her like the April sun . " Honey , anything you want to do 's all right . " bringing in sacks of meal and sugar , glass demijohns and oak kegs . The storekeeper brought five hundred pounds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you never figgered you 'd be ' shinin ' . " " No . " " But you could n't git you no better place fer it .

" " They got no reason to say nothin ' . The only reason anybody 'd turn anybody else up was if he 'd done somethin ' to him . Then they 'd git at him thata-way . Git his still , see ? Git him tore up . That way they 'd git him . " She made no further comment . Her silence made its way through the wail of his egotism . " You do n't talk as much as you did , Matt . Else I got used to it . " " I was alone so long , honey . Seemed like I had to git caught up . " But the spring warmth was no longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man was bringing in chilled the exuberance that had made her voluble . " I 'm fixin ' to learn you to make the whiskey , Matt . " She stared at him . " Less help we have , knowin ' how much I got an ' where ' t is , better it suits me , see ? " She said finally , " I kin learn . " The work seemed strange , when all her folk had farmed and timbered . But her closest contact with Trax was over the sour , seething mash . When they walked together back of the house , down to the running branch , their bodies pushing side by side through the low palmettos , they were a unit . Except to curse her briefly when she was clumsy , he was good-natured at his work . Crouching by the fire burning under the copper drum , the slow dripping from the coils , of the distillate , the only sound except for small woods life , she felt themselves man and wife . At other times his lovely body and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell his wares . He drove to the village and to neighboring towns and cities , inviting friends and acquaintances to have a drink from one of the gallon jugs under the rear seat of the borrowed car . They pronounced it good ' shine . To the favored few financially able to indulge themselves he gave a drink of the " aged " liquor . Accustomed to the water-clear , scalding rawness of fresh ' shine , they agreed gravely that no better whiskey ever came in from Cuba . He let it be known that both brands would be available at any time , day or night , at the old Terry house four miles south of the village . He made a profound impression . Most bootleggers sold stuff whose origin and maker were unknown . Most ' shiners had always made it , or drifted into it aimlessly . Trax brought a pomp and ceremony to the local business . Men found their way out the deep-rutted road . They left their cars among the pines and stumbled through the hammock to the house . They gathered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his purposes . The long trenchered table old man Terry had sliced from red bay , held the china pitcher of " corn " and the jelly glasses from which they drank . Their bird-dogs and hounds padded across the piazza and lay before the fire . Trax drank with them , keying their gatherings to hilarity . He was a convivial host . Sometimes Blaine brought along his guitar , and Trax clapped his hands and beat his feet on the floor as the old man picked the strings . But he was uneasy when a quarrel developed . Then he moved , white-facedamong the men , urging someone else to stop it . At first the woman tried to meet them hospitably . When , deep in the hammock at the still , she heard the vibration of a motor , she hurried up to the house to greet the guests . She smoothed back the gray hair from her worn face and presented her middle-aged bulk in a clean apron . If there was one man alone , Trax introduced her casually , insolently : " This is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came together , he ignored her . She stood in the doorway , smiling vaguely . He continued his talk as though she were not there . Sometimes one of the group , embarrassed , acknowledged her presence . " How do , ma'am . " For the most part they took their cue from Trax and did not see her . Once , on her withdrawal to the kitchen , a stranger had followed for a match . " Do n't you mind workin ' way out here in the woods ? " But she decided that Trax was too delicate to want his wife mixing with men who came to drink . At night he sometimes invited her into the big room with conspicuous courtesy . That was when one or two women had come with the men . Her dignity established the place as one where they might safely come . She sat miserably in their midst while they made banal jokes and drank from the thick glasses . They were intruders . Their laughter was alien among the pine trees . She stayed at the still most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The run must be made when the mash was ready , whether it was day or night . It was better for Trax to stay at the house to take care of the customers . In the early fall he was ready to expand . Matt was alone , scrubbing the floors between runs of whiskey . She heard a powerful car throbbing down the dirt road . It blew a horn con-GAL YOUNG UN stantly in a minor key . Men usually came into this place silently . She went to the piazza , wet brush in hand . With the autumnal drying of foliage , the road was discernible . The scent of wild vanilla filled the flat-woods . She drew in the sweetness , craning her neck to see . A large blue sedan of expensive make swerved and rounded into the tracks other cars had made to the house . Trax was driving . He swung past the twin live oaks and into the sandy yard . He slammed the door behind him as he stepped out . He had bought the car with the remainder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's profits . He was ready to flash across his old haunts , a big operator from the interior . " I kin sell that hundred gallons of aged stuff now fer what it 's worth . " He nodded wisely . He sauntered into the house , humming under his breath . " Hi-diddy-um-tum ? " He was vibrant with an expectancy in which she had no part . She heard him curse because the floor was wet . The cat crossed his path . He lifted it by the tail and slid ' it along the slippery boards . The animal came to her on the piazza . She drew it into her lap and sat on her haunches a long time , stroking the smooth hard head . Life was a bad dream . Trax was away a week at a time . He hired the two Lantry boys to take his place . Matt worked with them , for the boys unwatched would let the mash ferment too long . Trax returned to the flat-woods only for fresh supplies of liquor and of clean clothes . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtly with the blue sedan . He wore light-blue shirts and a red necktie that was a challenging fire under the dark insolent face . Matt spent hours each week washing and ironing the blue shirts . She protested his increasing absences . " Trax , you jest ai n't here at all . I hardly got the heart fer makin ' the runs , an ' you gone . " He smiled . " Any time it do n't suit you , I kin move my outfit to the east coast . " He laid the threat across her like a whip . The young Lantrys too saw Trax glamorously . They talked of him to Matt as they mixed the mash , fired , and kept their vigils . This seemed all she had these days of the man : talk of him with the boys beside the still . She was frustrated , filled , not with resentment , but with despair . Yet she could not put her finger on the injustice . She flailed herself with his words , " Any time you do n't like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trax ' old customers as best she could , running up the slight incline from the still-site to the house when she heard a car . Her strong body was exhausted at the end of the week . Yet when she had finished her elaborate baking on Saturday night she built up a roaring fire in the front room , hung the hot water kettle close to it for his bath , and sat down to wait for him . Sometimes she sat by the fire almost all night . Sometimes he did not come at all . Men learned they could get a drink at Colton 's any hour of the night on Saturday . When the square dance at Trimtree 's was done , they came out to the flat-woods at two or three o'clock in the morning . The woman was always awake . They stepped up on the piazza and saw her through the window . She sat brooding by the fire , the striped cat curled in her lap . Around her bony shoulders she hugged the corduroy hunting jacket Trax had worn when he came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the throb of the blue sedan came close ; the Sunday mornings when he slept late and arose , sulky , for a lavish breakfast and dinner . Then he was gone again , and she was waving after him down the road . She thought that her love and knowledge of him had been always nothing but this watching through the pine trees as he went away . The village saw more of him . Occasionally he loitered there a day to show off before he headed for the coast . At times he returned in the middle of the week and picked up fifteen or twenty gallons cached at Blaine 's and did not go out to the flat-woods at all . On these occasions he had invariably a girl or woman with him ; cheap pretty things whose lightness brought them no more than their shoddy clothes . The storekeeper , delivering meal and sugar to Matt , lingered one day . The still needed her , but she could not with courtesy dismiss him . At last he drew courage . " Mis ' Matt , dogged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you , but folks thinks you do n't know how he 's a-doin ' you . You 're workin ' like a dog , an ' he ai n't never home . " " I know . " " You work at ' shinin ' , somethin ' you nor your folks never done  --  not that it ai n't all right ? An ' Trax off in that big fine car spendin ' the money fast as he turns it over . " " I know . " " The Klan talks some o ' givin ' him down the country fer it . " " ' Tai n't nobody 's business but his an ' mine . " " Mis ' Matt " ? he scuffled in the sand ? " I promised I 'd speak of it . D' you know Trax has got him women goin ' round with him ? " " No . I did n't know that . " " Ev'ybody figgered you did n't know that . " He mopped his forehead . " The day you an ' Trax was married , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothin ' but your money an ' place he wanted to git him set up . " " That 's my business , too , " she said stonily . He dropped his eyes before the cold face and moved to his truck . She called after him defiantly : " What else did I have he 'd want anyway ! " She went into the house . She understood the quality of her betrayal . The injustice was clear . It was only this : Trax had taken what he had not wanted . If he had said , " Give me the money and for the time , the house , " it would have been pleasant to give , solely because he wanted . This was the humiliation : that she had been thrown in on the deal , like an old mare traded in with a farm . The Lantry boys called unanswered from the palmettos . She had known . There was no need of pretense . There was no difference between to-day and yesterday . There was only the dissipation of a haze , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , so that , instead of knowing , she saw . The man came home late Saturday afternoon . Startled , Matt heard the purr of the motor and hurried to the house from the still . She thought the woman with him had come for liquor . She came to meet them , wiping her hands on her brown gingham apron . Trax walked ahead of his companion , carrying his own shiny patent leather bag and a smaller shabby one . As they came into the house , she saw that it was not a woman , but a girl . The girl was close on his heels , like a dog . She was painted crudely , as with a haphazard conception of how it should be done . Stiff blond curls were bunched under a tilted hat . A flimsy silk dress hung loosely on an immature frame . Cheap silk stockings bagged on thin legs . She rocked , rather than walked , on incredibly spiked heels . Her shoes absorbed Matt 's attention . They were pumps of blue kid , the precise blue of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fer me on the east coast . " Trax was voluble . " Used that coastal highway oncet too often . First thing I knowed , down below New Smyrna , I seed a feller at a garage give the high sign , an ' I 'm lookin ' into the end of a .45 , " He flushed . " I jest did git away . It 'll pay me to work this territory a whiles , till they git where they do n't pay me no mind over there agin . " The girl was watching Matt with solemn blue eyes . Beside the gray bulk of the older woman , she was like a small gaudy doll . Trax indicated her to Matt with his thumb . " Elly here 'll be stayin ' at the house a while . " He picked up the shabby bag and started up the stairs . " Long as you an ' me is usin ' the downstairs , Matt , she kin sleep upstairs in that back room got a bed in it . " She pushed past the girl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What 's this gal ? " " Ai n't no harm to her . " He laughed comfortably . He tweaked a wisp of her gray hair . " She 's jest a little gal young un , " he said blandly , " ' s got no place to go. ? He drew the girl after him . The woman stared at the high-heeled blue slippers clicking on every step . ( To be concluded )
