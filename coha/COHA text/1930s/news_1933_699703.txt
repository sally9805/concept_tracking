txt CHEYENNE , Wyo. , April 20 . ? The beer bill which the Wyoming legislature rushed through in the closing hours of the session is turning out to be a boomerang . The jubilation of the thirsty has been short-lived , and they are now watching with zealous interest the litigation which has already started , even before the act could become effective . On Feb. 18 , anticipating by several weeks the Congressional rush of prohibition repeal and beer legislation , two bills were hurried through the legislative mill . One repealed Wyoming 's enforcement act , and the other authorized the manufacture and sale of 4 per cent beer . Both measures were promptly signed by Governor Leslie A. Mller . Prohibition groups were slightly disturbed at the dispatch with which these new statutes were put through , but those who were friendly to the bills settled back in satisfaction . Wyoming got into the national limelight . This State , it was pointed out , could , if it so desired , be the first to act on the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for hurry . Not until nearly a month later was it discovered that the Legislature had failed to append enactment clauses on either of the measures . No Beer Until May 18 . This omission makes the bills automatically effective on May 18 , or ninety days after the Legislature adjourned . There seems to be no explanation for the omission . At any rate , when legalized beer became available on April 7 in Montana on the north and Colorado on the south , Wyoming found itself forced to wait another six weeks . Resigned to the enforced wait Wyoming this week saw the new beer law under violent fire from several points . Several things seem to be wrong with it . To begin with , one section of the law , prohibiting the advertising of beer by dealers , is already the basis of a court action started by a Cheyenne hotel owner and two grocers . They assert that the section Is unconstitutional because advertising is not mentioned in the title of the act , although it is included in a regulatory section . Previous opinions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when there was a conflict . between the body of the act and its title . Licensing Provision Involved . The act embraces several subjects which are not mentioned in the title ? provision for the licensing of beer dispensers by cities and counties ; restriction of sales to certain kinds of firms , and the prohibition of sales to minors . Should the licensing provisions be held invalid , for instance , there exists no State law for the licensing of dealers in 4 per cent beer , which the act legalizes . Any one might engage in the manufacture and sale of such beer without hindrance by the State . Municipalities might impose and enforce license requirements and restrictions , but counties would be powerless to collect fees or to regulate beer production and sales . Meanwhile , the Governor has issued detailed instructions for the conduct of Wyoming 's precinct , county and State conventions to consider repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment . The precincts will vote on May 15 , the county convention will gather on May 18 and the State convention will be held at Casper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal holiday .
