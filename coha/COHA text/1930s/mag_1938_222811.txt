In Chicago last week Arthur Holly Compton , one of the world 's most famed cosmic ray experts , startled a gathering of some 100 distinguished physicists by retracting a theory which he had espoused two and a half years ago , and by putting forth a new one in its place . Cosmic rays are electrified particles which constantly bombard Earth from every direction . It is estimated that about 30 shoot through every human body every second . They have energies higher than any particles ever propelled by man-made machines- energies , in some cases , measured in hundreds of billions of electron-volts. * <P> For several years , while cosmic ray research was emerging from its infancy , University of Chicago 's Compton engaged in a polite but nonetheless spirited controversy with California Institute of Technology 's Robert Andrews Millikan . Compton contended that the rays were mostly electric particles , Millikan that they were mostly photons ( electrically inert bundles of radiation ) . In January 1936 , Compton presented a thoroughgoing resume of his researches up to that time which neutral observers considered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Compton ( TIME , Jan. 13 , 1936 ) . By that time most cosmic ray workers were speaking in terms of particles , and photons were dropping rapidly out of the picture . Among the mass of evidence for particles , one key point is that the fact that they respond-as electrically inert photons could not-to Earth 's magnetic field , showing variations by latitude . <P> Dr. Compton , like practically all of his colleagues , still believes the rays to be particles . The retraction he made last week concerned their place of origin . He once believed they came from the remotest depths of space beyond the Milky Way , which is the huge galaxy of stars to which the sun and its planets inconspicuously belong . The disc-shaped Milky Way appears to be slowly rotating like an enormous wheel . Therefore , if the rays come from outside the galaxy , whichever side of Earth happens to be facing the direction of rotation should receive a few more rays than the back of the planet , just as a child riding a carousel in the rain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . This should result in a small daily variation in cosmic ray incidence at a given point on Earth , as the earth 's own daily rotation swings that point from front to back of the galactic movement . Some observers claimed that such a variation , of 1% or less , was actually recorded in their meters . <P> Since then Dr. Compton , who has seven observation stations in his far-flung cosmic ray empire , has checked up on the variation . Another cosmic ray bigwig , Professor Manuel Sandoval Vallarta of Massachusetts Institute of Technology , calculated what it should be theoretically , after discounting the effect of the magnetic field of the sun . On making this correction , the observed variation was practically nil . Hence , Dr. Compton now prefers to believe that the cosmic rays come from within , not without , the Milky Way-that they whiz around inside it like rats in a trap , prisoned there by the gigantic magnetic field of the galaxy , while electrically neutral starlight escapes to the outside .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
