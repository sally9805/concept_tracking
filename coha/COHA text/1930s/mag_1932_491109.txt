T WOULD have meant money and comfort to millions of Americans if they had followed advice given three thousand years ago : " In the day of prosperity be joyful , but in the day of adversity consider ! " Translated from the King James version into stock-market jargon , it is : In a hear market be sure you do what you did n't do in the bull market ! " When you deal with slates of mind you learn that men have always been what they are today , ticker or no ticker . The reason why the stock market must necessarily remain the same is that speculators do n't change ; they ca n't . They could see no top early in 1929 and they could see no bottom Into in 1931 .

Nevertheless , there is a general belief that the wise rich escaped punishment  --  as usual . You incessantly hear about the huge losses of the unlucky multitude , though there has not been any destruction of actual wealth or tangible property , as happens in war . The financial reviews at the end of the year that dwelt on the extent of the losses did not remind the losers that the first to go were the dream dollars . Everybody who looked for easy money in 1928 or 1929 lost both dreams and cash in 1929 or 1930 . In 1931 nobody was spared .

Tshe great social equalizer is the common need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spending ; and everybody has had to do that lately . Nevertheless , delusions persist : The delusion that the world , so wonderful during the boom , is going to pot via the lost-money route ; that the way to recover from hard times is to keep on hoping that somebody else will do something about it , preferably the politicians or the hankers ; that cities , states and ' Uncle Sam can put off giving the taxpayers their money 's worth as long as they try to offset deficits by increasing the taxes of t lie rich . This last . is as great , a de-lusion as the human mind can hold , its chief purpose being to win votes and to increase the burdens of the ultimate consumer  --  the deluded poor .

It is natural that the worst financial collapse in the world 's history should set , a high record for money losses . The average man prefers to hear in detail how , why and when money is lost , rather than to listen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about the only point on which all commentators on the world depression agree is chat many millions of people have lost many millions of dollars . Of course , the same people lost . many of her things as well , for the revenge that easy money takes on its temporary possessor is that. , when it leaves him , after a boom , it carTHE REAL WEALTH who lost billions when the bull market ended were called silly asses for thinking they could get something for nothing  --  fools who deserved to lose because they violated the fundamental principles of the ancient art of making money the moment they tried to play the other man 's game . Now we see that if poor fools lost in 1929 , the wise rich lost in 1031 . Nobody escaped . It was a. lesson for everybody to learn  --  and we have learned it . From the peak in 1929 to the low of December of the Rune year , the shrinkage in the market value of stocks dealt in on the New York Stock Exchange amounted to more than 526,000,000,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of 1931 , the shrinkage in the same stocks amounted to nearly , 560,000 , - 000,000 . From the high of 1930 to the low of 1931 , it was about 845,000,000,000 . The shrinkage in 1929 from peak to bottom in listed bonds , in which poor fools did n't gamble , was less than 81,000,000,000 , but from September , 1930 , to December , 1931 , the difference exceeded $10,000,000,000 . In bonds , remember ! In other words . from the height of the speculative madness to the time when the poor pikers were eliminated , the total loss was only about $27,000,000,000 in both stocks and bonds on the New York Stock Exchange . But from the spring of 19:30 to the end of 1931 , or after the little fellow had been wiped out , the loss exceeded 555,000,000,000 . From the top of the boom to December , 1931 , the shrinkage was 882,000,000,000 . Wall Street , the Indian Giver T HESE statistics make no more impression on the average mind than the figures of the distance to Betelgeuse . They are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these unassimilable sums represent only a part of the total depreciation . If we were to include the losses in the value of unlisted stocks and of all kinds of bonds and real estate and commercial and banking failures , it would be found that the aggregate realizable assets of the American people have temporarily shrunk beyond calculation . After considering these figures , I am convinced that . the most remarkable thing about it all is that we could take such a loss and still live  --  buy and sell and vote . Less than 3 per cent of the American people pay an income tax to Uncle Sam , and 90 per cent of the entire tax is paid by less than one-quarter of 1 per cent . of the population . The 1930 tax figures showed that the sturdy old 3 per cent . of the population suffered a loss in income running into the hundreds of millions ; and , of course , the 1931 income will show still greater losses . The boom that turned so many average Americans into stock-market millionaires in 1928 and 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to take away far more than it had given . But it has been discovered that the losses of millions by millions have more than a conversational value : They automatically become the universal and unassailable alibi . Ask any doctor , banker , landlord , credit . manager or any seller of anything . All will testify that they get the same answer from customers : " I lost every cent I had in the world in the stock market and I have n't had a chance to get any of it back . I will pay as soon as I can . . . . No , I ca n't pay you a part . of it . " If the creditor happens to be obstinate and an optimist , he gets mass-production excuses and some autobiography . The chapters may be three or ten , but the last one is always : " I did n't know enough to be satisfied with a good profit . I did n't think there was any top to them . I was a fool . " Times when a postscript @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ serves me right . " Millions of these stock-market losers seem in-capable of forgetting their Waterloo . The blunders of ' 29 hide the vista of possible successes in ' 32 . It is a had state of mind for a nation to fall into , especially when it is demonstrable that what the multitude , in. their ignorance , did in 1929 , the elite , in their wis-dom , did in 1930 and 1931 . The minus microbe plays no favorites . Neither native ability nor business experience , neither unusual sagacity nor ample capital can keep men from losing money at losing time . Some thousands of years ago a wise man said : " There is a time to get and a time to lose . " And do n't forget that Solomon , in his day , was considered quite a getter . The average man is apt to endow the multi-millionaire with infallible judgment in business mat-ters . That probably is the reason why we hear so mu ( li about . the present nonspending of the pre-sumably rich . Perfectly decent . families.are insulted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of every-thing . What is a tragedy if you are idle , prudence if you are on part . time and thrift if you are underpaid , becomes murder in the first . degree in the rich man who could instantly end the depression by buying four overcoats or ten hats and con- siderately wearing them out in a. week . There is no question that the poor are poorer , but the rich cer- tainly are not richer . The man who had nothing has doubled one of his zeros , but the average mil- lionaire has lost three of them . One of the richest men in the world , according to an intimate friend , dropped eight zeros  --  preceded by a seven or eight . The rich somehow in money losses . " Do n't glare at me , " said my friend . " People at times forget that losing money is about the easiest thing in the world . It is the one habit that money has kept up since it was invented . Perhaps the loss of money has its usefulness , like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they could not live , on account of the overpopulation of the earth . If it were not for the myriad natural enemies of all fortunes , we would all be rich . And then nobody would work and everybody would starve in opulence . To everything there is a season , and a time to every purpose under the heaven . . . a time to keep , and a time to cast away . ' This is a time to cast away bad mental habits . " " Well , " I said politely , " I can tell you something that did not happen in Solomon 's day . During this month of December , 1931 , in the midst . of the gloom of demoralized security markets , what has most impressed me has been not the need of financial and political leaders in this crisis but the number of men and women I have heard actually boasting of their financial reverses . The magnitude of the loss has replaced the magnitude of the fortune as a measure of social importance . The minus sign instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not sadly but proudly , how much they and their intimate friends are in the red . The depression has created a new class  --  entire families whose huge fortunes have shrunk to toothpick dimensions . Socially they still constitute the aristocracy , like the nobility of a fresh-made republic which abolishes hereditary titles but can not abolish ancestry . In 1929 , most of the losing was done by the untitled bourgeoisie who used to admit that they were D. F. 's . Today the big loser is the magnate , now respected because he had so much to lose . He is praised for surviving . The worse the wounds , the greater the honor . Nothing can deprive an ex-king of the social distinction which the accident of royal birth confers on its chief victims . The ex-multi today can not buy Old Masters by the dozen , but his loyal friends can still brag about the hundreds of bull-market millions he used to have . The doctor or the retailer who lost his all merely did what anyone can do far better with less than 1000 shares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by Degree of Failure ELL , I hope you can make the piker feel better by telling him about . the big losers " ? and my hanker friend left me in a hurry . I think he saw indiscreet questions in my eyes . That same afternoon I found myself in the Park Avenue apartment of a very wealthy and very intelligent magnate whose hobby also happens to be mine . My host 's wife came in as we were discussing the slump . Our respective collections , we assured each other , had not done so badly as firstclass bonds . My friend 's wife had been to a tea . The market had been misbehaving that day and it seems that her friends had talked of nothing else . " I could n't believe it , " she asserted . " Why not ? " asked her husband . He could not know what she could not believe ; but they had been married thirty years . " Why , Mrs. Thompson told me that James So-and-So had lost more money than anybody else in the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ believes So-and-So to be the largest individual holder of the stocks of six or eight corporations engaged in a major industry . " You know , " she went on , certain that I shared her incredulity , " he was worth about 5200,000,000 . Some people said more " And some said less , " her husband put in . " Call it $150,000,000 , " I said , being a pacifist by nature . Of course , everybody knows that So-andSo is  --  or was  --  one of the richest . men in the United States . You did not have to sail on his yacht with him to find it out , even if you knew that all great . fortunes are always overestimated , excepting by the possessor at income-tax time . " Mrs. Thompson said that James So-and-So himself told her the other night that with Xlifi at 30 , and PN at 16 , and LPT at 27 , and JW at . 53 , he was worth less I han $12,000.000 , instead of $200,000,00 ? or more before the slump . He said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ full dividend are those of which he has less than 5000 shares . But stocks like PN , for instance , of which he owns a great many thousands of shares , stopped paying entirely . From 200 to 12 is some drop , when it 's in It was plain that Mr. So-and-So was a personage in her sight . " How about you ? " I asked her husband . " I did n't do so well as that , " he admitted modestly . " Ile could n't . He did n't have as much to drop from as James So-and-So ( lid , " his wife apologized " No , " Henry said to her , " but a little later tonight . I 'll tell you what we have left , and you 'll think better of me . " Knowing that my host- was on intimate terms 1Nrith many of the disgracefully rich , I asked him to tell me how badly his friends had been hit . " I 've been too busy looking after my own wounds , " he answered , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ca n't go anywhere without hearing the kind of talk my better half re-galed you Milli . Of course , you ca n't depend on hearsay . Losses at such a time as this are quite as likely to be unduly magnified as winnings were dur-ing the bull market . Moreover , many of them are only paper losses . However , every now and then you can get reliable figures . This is particularly true when you study the inventories of the estates of some of the extremely rich men di ? have died , let . us say , from 1927 to date . You remember Walter Wyse , do n't you ? As the son and grandson of men identi-lied with h a. certain New York bank and other enter-prises , he was known to have inherited great . wealth . Since the inheritance taxes came I have insisted that a rich man should pick his dying day with great care  --  that . is , if he loves his family . Poor Wyse , who was a very nice chap , was unlucky enough to pass @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his stocks were practically at the top . He was one of the largest stockholders in a certain bank , and. , I understand , owned a very large block of Consolidated Bronze when these shares sold at 650 and 210 , respectively . I ca n't tell you what else he held , but I know that one of his near relatives told me the other day that what with the inheritance taxes and the shrinkage in prices , the total value of his estate was less than S1,000,000 ? not enouvh to pay his bequests . I do not think I ought to mention names , but . several others must occur to you . It would be no trouble to get copies of inventories and figure how much less those estates are worth today than when their late owners were living . " Not Too Sick to Look for a Profit " F ALL t he great Wall street . bankers , one of the VI shrewdest , most successful , most famous and most respected was Mr. Blank . You probably heard the story of how , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quite ill at home . The doctor 's orders were that he was to stay in bed . One morning , during the worst . of the slump , t he nurse came in and saw him sitting up . " ' Oh , Mr. Blank , you must . lie down ! ' " ' No , no ! ' said the old chap . ' I read the morning papers , and I have to go to the bank . ' " But , 11r . Blank , the doctor said you were not to get up under any circumstances . You must keep very quiet . ' " ' No , ' said Mr. Blank deter- minedly . ' I have to go down I have a Nrays made buying in panics . ' " Well , he died somemonlhslater . His estate eonsisted of hundreds of n't do it . The old romance had died a quick and permanent death ; smothered , she thought merrily , suffocated and drowned , indeed , in fruit salad with mayonnaise for dinner . It had been on its way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The years since their youth had changed them too much ; he was n't what she remembered or what she wanted except . in externals . Perhaps , if she had started out with him long ago , in place of Cara Mai , there might shares of different , stocks . I have been informed that . his holdings of the stock of his own bank are worth today about $30,000,000 less than in 1929 . He had 200,000 shares of one of the market leaders that shows a decline of more than 200 points from the top . On the huge block of New York Midland which stood in his name , the shrinkage amounts to more than 200 points . The exact figures of his holdings of all kinds of stocks and bonds are not essential ; the point to consideris that the shrewdest banker in the United States , if his personal fortune and the price of his bank 's stock are any measure , was not shrewd enough to reduce his holdings materially during the bull market . No matter what he sold , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Blank fortune is estimated by people who ought to know , at more than 5200,000,000 . This may be an exaggeration , but he was a very rich man . " You would be surprised if I told you how many of the leaders of the late bull market admit that . they made the one mistake that you expect from only inexperienced traders ? that is , selling good stocks to protect bad ones . Of course , the need to discriminate was not so important during the boom , when all kinds of stocks went up . But . when the market turned , it was impossible to dispose of the lemons . From what my friends tell me , I think the chief reason why so many stocks are selling below their real value is that men of means , who ordinarily would pick up bargains , impaired their buying power through holding on to cats and dogs . " Insiders Out of Luck " You know Colonel Montgomery , do n't you ? He is a scion of one of the wealthiest families in the world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own achievements . Throughout the hull market he never failed to keep a 75 per cent margin . That margin was wiped out in the slump . For a while he was merely a looker-on . How large his paper profits were at one time , his brokers , who also are my brokers , naturally would not tell me , but the gossip of the office was that they ran into the millions . " In 1930 Montgomery decided that prices had reached bargain levels . He began to buy , on a scale down , stocks of companies in which he was a director . Prices , however , declined until he had to stop buying and realized that he had misjudged conditions . Business was getting worse instead of better . His market commitments were large enough to frighten him into activity . He always had so much money that dollars were merely chips to him .

What about Edward Simms ' years of thoughtful devotion , his generous care , ( Continued front Page 5 ) called on for more margin . He had already turned over to his brokers all the securities he owned outright ; but , of course , that collateral also had depreciated appallingly . All he had left were his real-estate holdings , and he mortgaged them to raise money to protect his account . Prices went . still lower , and when the stock in which his holdings were the heaviest joined the nondividend class he sold his dividend-paying stocks to protect the nondividend . He could n't sell that stock , because there was no market for it and he had reams @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ director of corporations , an intimate friend of great hankers , who today is a man without an income , but with a life habit of never considering costs . " A vice president of the bank with which I do most of my business , " continued my friend , " told me the other day that by far the largest losses of all are those sustained by one of the richest men in the world , who , among other things , happens to own a large interest in that same bank . Its stock is now selling at 30 , or 200 points below the top . This man , or he and his family together , own 25 per cent of the capital stock of each of a dozen companies associated with his name . In one of these he bought an additional 1,000,000 shares in 1930 , when he thought . the price was very low , only to see it selling today at less that one-half of what that 1,000,000 shares cost him . I can not Vouch for these figures , but I have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was underestimating . " The lesson to be learned is that this man , with expert advisers and inside knowledge of the business , proved to be no wiser than the piker who blindly followed tips . Financial writers , especially those whose penchant for fiction makes them play up the dramatic at the expense of the actual , are always seeking to show the little chap in the grasp of ruthless financial cannibals whose only desire is to add millions to their millions . But I want . to tell you that I have been in several pools . Those that were closed out before the crash paid fairly well , but all of us were landed with stocks that show tremendous losses today . In my own line of business the most spectacularly successful man , extremely shrewd , with a flair for financial matters as well as a genius for manufacturing , dropped a great many millions in sundry pools that friends induced him to go into .

" A few days before Christmas an old-timer in Wall Street and I were talking about some of the changes in the character of the brokerage houses . We went over the New York Stock Exchange Directory together and picked out the big houses of today . We then went back a generation , to the days when firms like Moore &; Schley and Flower &; Co. were at the top of the heap . We went still farther back , but when he receded into the 70 's I refused to follow him . The story is still to be written about . these commission houses that rose , flourished and dropped into obscurity or went out altogether . Lost Leaders of Wall Street Usually the end came when the men who made the firm powerful passed away or retired .

We drew up a list of what we considered the twelve foremost houses on . the Stock Exchange today . Of that worthy dozen there was only one that would have been included among the first twelve in 1900 . The unparalleled vitality of that house , we decided , must be due to the fact that the head of the firm in 1900 was still the head of the firm in 1931 . I had not seen him in several years , but I made it a point to call on him that afternoon after the close . He has always done a big business , numbering great plungers , shrewd capitalists and resourceful business men among his customers .

Suppose , now , as man to man , that you tell me what you did with all the money you made during the boom . I know it was a lot . " " I invested it ! " he shouted .

To be accepted as the Lord 's visible providence is a much higher compliment than to be known as merely another man with an indeterminate number of silent millions . And of course , to be fair , there is also the pleasure that any decent man feels when he is helping his fellow men . Today even philanthropy has had to be curtailed . In the ease of our friend , I think he would rather give up all his luxuries than stop being fairy godfather to no end of little colleges and hospitals and institutions of all kinds operating for the relief of human suffering .

As a matter of fact , long-time investments have at all times been most difficult to make . Too many things can happen that are beyond man 's ability to foresee . You smiled when I told you that I had lost my winnings because I invested them . You assumed , of course , that I invested them , as I thought , wisely . That is precisely what happened . My own troubles in the past were with an embarrassment of riches rather than with the difficulty of finding good securities .

As he grew old he began to develop doubts , as old men will , about the financial wisdom of his progeny .

' Ah , yes , ' said the baron , ' hut , you see , he had a rich father and I did n't . ' " Well , the baron devoted considerable time to considering how he might prevent his fortune from being dissipated by his children . He decided to do something that would put it beyond the power of his heirs to reduce it . In the fullness of time he died . When his last will and testament was read , it was found that he had left specific instructions about . what the money must be invested in . Under no circumstances was the investment ever to be changed by his heirs .

He was absolutely certain , when he made his will , that nothing could possibly happen to hurt . the bonds of the four greatest governments in the world . Something might . happen to one or another , but certainly not to all four countries . A friend of mine , who is a Paris banker , told me the other day that less than 15 per cent of that colossal fortune remains . So much for brains and experience .

That is 106 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 13,1932 what he got for being rich enough to stand pat . It is really too bad that we did n't sell him out when the little fellows were forced out . The pikers are still grumbling because the brokers sold them out instead of waiting for a rally . The millionaires regret . they were not pikers to be sold out then . " Everybody knows that values have nothing to do with market . prices today . The situation is exactly the opposite of 1929 , when the price also had little to do with the earnings . It may he we are all going to the devil , but if we are not , all I can say is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been recently . " Making a Market for MB Another of my broker friends whom I asked for sad stories said : " I ca n't betray confidences or tell you the secrets of my valued customers . But you yourself have written many times that Wall Street does n't beat the public ; that people beat themselves when they head for the ticker instead of for their desk or their factory . I suppose you had in mind the typical sucker . But I can tell you a story of foolish plays made by men who ought to know better . Sometime in 1928 , I think , the president of one of the banks with whom we do business asked me to call on him . I did so , and he asked me if we would undertake to make a market for the stock of a specialty concern that his securities company had helped to float . The securities company held a large block of Metal Blinds , which it had been unable to market at a profit . In addition to that , some of the directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a time when almost anybody could sell almost anything in the way of a common stock if he went about it in the right way . Somehow my friends had been unable to develop a market big enough to unload theirs on . The price had been marked up at first. , but it . had sagged . Apparently they couldn't. keep it up without getting more long stock from disappointed holders than they cared to take . What , you call the art of stock manipulation apparently was beyond that bunch . To us , all we see in making a market for a stock is a merchandising process . We try to induce people to buy securities , because that is our business . We make sure the goods are right , because we never misrepresent . Well , our friends thought we had the facilities and the experience while they had the goods ; and so we undertook to make a. market . for MB . " It had been banging around 15 or 18 without buyers . We looked into the company 's business , saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ succeeded in creating a demand for the stock . The price rose to 35 or 40 . We sold out all the stock that had been intrusted to us at an average of thirty dollars a. share . Of course , by that time the price was several points higher . ' We thought we had done a good piece of work and , as a matter of fact , Whoever bought what we sold could have made a profit selling it to someone else , for it went still higher . We gave it its start and called it a day . After our work was done we had no further special interest in MB . When the crash came in 1929 we probably did n't have more than a few hundred shares in the office . We had advised our customers to lighten . ship . On the slump the price broke pretty badly , rallied a little and slowly sagged . It behaved like hundreds of other stocks . " In the spring of 1930 a friend of mine , who belongs to one of the richestfamilies in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ many banks and corporations , a man of ability , experience , capital and courage above the average , called on me . We had done business at various times with him , although he never was one of our regular customers . He has been in a number of pools that we have managed . " ' Bill , ' he said to me , ' I have been talking with Weyman , Cramer &; Seibel , and they advised me to come over and see if I can get you to help us out . ' " ' I 'll be glad to do anything I can , ' I said . " Well , ' he confessed , ' we 've got . a pool in Metallic Blind and there is n't any market for the stock . ' " ' I thought we sold all you had , ' I said . " So you did , but  --  er  --  alp  --  we got into it again . We 're stuck with it . ' " I naturally thought he and the others had bought back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It would make that repurchased stock cost them relatively little . " ' What does it average you ? ' I asked . " He flushed up and looked uncomfortable , and then he confessed , ' Well , after you sold out our original stock at 30 , you remember the damn thing was stronger than ever . It . certainly looked as though it was on its way to 100 . In fact , I don't. mind telling you now that we thought you had sold that stock too soon and too cheap . ' " Selling at 50 , Buying at 40 " ' Did you fellows recall that you . could n't sell it at 15 and that we got twice as much for it ? ' I asked him , without the slightest heat . " Oh , yes , but we thought that . you had underestimated the bull market ; and when we saw the way the public was trading in that stock by the tens of thousands of shares when we had been unable to sell it by the hundred , we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So we formed a pool and  --  well , to tell you the truth , Bill , we thought we could save quite a. little . We paid what we thought was a pretty stiff price for your services , in the way of commissions on the stock you bought and sold to make a market . You had done all the preliminary work needed and it had cost . a lot of money , so we decided to try running a pool ourselves and make a little more on our own hook . We accumulated quite a jag of stock  - -  -  ' " ' At what . price ? ' I used my most . dulcet tones . " ' Oh , all the way from 40 to 50 , ' he confessed . We did n't have a chance to unload , because the slump came , and that was the end of the public buying . When MB started to break we had to support it , but it went . still lower , so we bought more , to bring down our average . We now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " ' Well , ' I told him , it 's around 15 to 18 now , which is exactly where it was when we took hold of it before . Unfortunately , we happen to be in a bear market , now and I do n't think it is going to be possible for you fellows to get out at a. profit .. ' " ' Oh , we do n't expect to make a profit , but we certainly do n't want to take a 25-point loss , ' he said . ' Do the best you can . ' " We had sold their original stock at 30 . The suckers , as cultured writers call the public , bought it all the way from 15 to 50 . The little suckers were all shaken out in November , 1929 , because they had no more margin to put up , but the millionaire suckers , being able to come across with whatever margin was demanded , held on like grim death . They would not take a loss . Keep in mind that the pool consisted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All of them are directors in large corporations and banks , and . they do not buy gold bricks . When they do they replate them and work them off . Well , those are the men who bought above 40 stock they had sold at 30 . " When Principle Lost Principal All men who are after easy money are brothers . The size of the bank roll is of no importance . They all disregard their brokers ' advice  --  according to the brokers . " We could n't do anything with the stock in 1930 , " went on my friend . " We tried and finally gave it up because they would not give us a free hand . They insisted on limiting their loss , because they had so much money to lose . In the end they had to sell it for about $7,000,000 less than it cost them . Of course , that did n't bankrupt the bunch. , but having to pay $7,000 , - 000 for plain suckerness was n't pleasant . " " That , " I assured the broker , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleasant feeling with everybody who hears it . For fear that you might spoil the effect , I will now say good-by . " " No ! Hold on ! I want . to tell you another . You know , we brought out Mosan Manufacturing some years ago . I think I told you how Jim Mosan wanted us to make the subscription price twenty dollars a share and we held out for forty dollars on the theory that the public would not buy it at twenty dollars a share , because a good stock ought to be worth more than that . We had to fight to induce the Mosan family to accept . twice as much . money for a part of their holdings as they insisted on receiving . This is gospel truth . The flotation was a great success . The company prospered enormously during the fat years that followed , and the earnings trebled . Well , when the stock crossed 155 , I called up Jim Mosan , who is one of our star customers and of whom I am very fond personally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jim , you and the rest of the Alosans together own 1,500,000 shares of that stock . Do you honestly think it is worth $155 a share ? ' " No , Bill , I do not ; and I am mighty sorry it . is selling there . ' " Well , then , ' I said , why do n't you sell some of it ? ' " ' I do n't like to . It does n't seem right for us to sell our own stock to others at a price that we know is too high . ' " ' But you didn't. put it up and you 're not advising people to buy it . The market is there . Nobody manipulated it . No inside pool is trying to unload . It is only common sense for you to prepare to protect your own stock in case of need , precisely because your name is associated with it . ' " ' I know , ' he said , ' but we just ca n't do it . We 've decided to hold all our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bill , for your interest . ' " That 's the story . The Mosans would not sell to the public their own stock at 150 because they did n't think it was worth 150 ! At today 's prices the Mosan holdings show a shrinkage of $200,000,000 . Now just what would you call that ? Do you admire the deed or do you blame Mosan ? I call it a. pretty swell thing to do . The Mosans knew as well as I did that the boom would not last . They had better means than anyone else of knowing that when business decreased , the dividend in all probability would have to be cut . Yet they never sold a single share . The price is in the 20 's now and probably hundreds of people blame the Mosans for not supporting their stock . As a matter of fact , they bought thousands of shares from 75 down and took an additional loss . " Milkmen of Wall Street It was part of my work in Wall Street for many years to make the personal acquaintance of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and still are divisible into two classes : the professionals , who work at nothing else , and nonprofessionals , consisting of railroad magnates or captains of industry to whom the stock market . is a profitable side line or a means to an end . By professional I mean men like James R. Keene or Addison Cammack or , in our day , " Larry Livingston , " who had nothing to do with the actual management of the companies in whose shares they traded . The late William R. Travers , another old-time professional , once called at the transfer office of n certain corporation for information that only a stockholder had a right to demand . The clerk asked him : " Have you an interest in this company , sir ? " and Travers replied : " 1 sh-should s-say I d-did . I am sh-short 20,000 shares of it . " But while these professionals influence fluctuations in stock prices , they never dictate corporation policies or try to run the business . Their interest begins and ends with the stock market . The great nonprofessional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ companies they direct , play the stock market with marked cards  --  and , at that , they often lose . They practiced , in dull times , what was called " milking , " which was true inside manipulation . The art came easy to many of them , for all had traded heavily as individuals before becoming market leaders . I have in mind men like H. 0 . Havemeyer , Thomas F. Ryan , John W. Gates , Daniel G. Reid , W. C. Durant , and lesser lights . Of course , Roswell P. Flower and E. H. Harriman knew the game from A to Z because , as members of the New York Stock Exchange , they had played it on the floor . Governor Flower 's public following during the McKinley boom was not exceeded in numbers until 1928 and 1929 , when the stock speculation was on a se-ale that in 1896 nobody dreamed possible . These great plungers , moreover , were also experienced business men  --  extreme types of the American of vision , resourcefulness and boldness  --  besides being excellent traders @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when they plunged they were merely using stage money to bet with . Of all the Wall Street plungers who also were promoters of consolidation and directing geniuses in great corporations , the greatest was Hiram G. Fletcher . That is not his real name . He began as a very poor boy  --  his was a pathetic childhood  --  became a very rich man , hobnobbed with the super-capitalists , was a great market . leader in the boom that followed the Armistice and made hundreds of millions of dollars for himself and his friends . Today he is neither rich nor a leader . No man before or since rose so high  --  or suffered such a drop . He was one of the greatest salesmen that ever lived . His press agents used to harp on his famous smile , until they made poor Fletcher develop the histrionic streak that did him so much harm . But the fact remains that he never had any trouble in selling either himself or his dreams . He started with hand machines , which he sold to individual customers , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pioneer in mass production , practicing it before its revolutionary character was perceived by the economists hired by corporations whose directors have stock tickers in their offices . From his earliest childhood Fletcher developed a habit of looking ahead . Time and again he saw his wildest dreams come true ; and he still dreamed on  --  to the tune of hundreds of - minions of dollars for his crowd . He was the most inveterate of optimists . It made him emperor of bull markets . But the throne tottered in bear markets . He could sell goods and be could sell himself to anybody who would listen , but his habit of seeing the future always rosy became a vice that made it impossible for him to sell out the huge lines of his own stocks that he carried . No matter how high they went , they were always going to be worth more because they had begun by being worth less ; and stock-market history must repeat itself . Where others doubted , he was certain . To those who failed to see future profits so clearly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accepted it was a goner ! Being a born bull , he was a cheerful companion . Having made huge profits , he could speak with authority . As he never cared for money , he was generous to a fault . 11 Maker of Millionaires All this is merely introductory to the assertion that until 1930 the greatest loss sustained by any individual in the history of Wall Street as a result of stock-market declines was Fletcher 's in 1921 . He formed the United Machine Corporation . It succeeded beyond his wildest expectations . But. , unfortunately , the stock market . had a fatal fascination for him . Ho had little use for money , but he loved what he could do with millions . Indeed , I have often thought he considered it his duty to put up his own stocks for the benefit of his friends . As a maker of millionaires , he surpassed Andrew Carnegie . He never learned to play the stock market cold-bloodedly . It . gave him too mtieli pleasure to see one of his pets rise five or ten points @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition from professionals and of profit takin.g by timid bulls . In the end he lost control of the company he had organized and directed for years . He started a new plant of his own . and , having more faith in the business and clearer vision and the courage that made him a crazy bull at the beginning of a big bull market , he succeeded in making the tail wag the dog . He regained control of his great corporation with the money he made with his little company in the shop and in the market . Aided by the greatest group of war millionaires in the land , he became a great . power in the stock market . But always he played the game like a rank outsider . He could not learn to sell . His Waterloo is one of the classic legends of Wall Street . A man who was present at the memorable meeting told me the story . 108 THE SATURDAY EVENING POST February 13,1932 " Previous to the postwar deflation slump , Fletcher put up the price of UM to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some hundreds of millions of dollars . In later years , when I heard of Fletcher 's winnings , I always insisted that if he had kept his original holdings of UM he would have been richer than Henry Ford . When the public stopped buying , we and other bankers began to hear rumors about Fletcher 's account and how persistently he ignored the calls for more margin . But his account was worth having and they were easy with the king . One of my friends got . a telephone message from him one day , asking whether the firm would carry some United Machinery for a friend of Fletcher 's . The broker answered that he would carry 200,000 shares for anybody  --  on a 50 per cent margin . " That 's a mighty big margin , ' said Fletcher . " ' That 's how we will carry it. , ' answered the broker . " The next day the broker was told to take over 100,000 shares of UM , and found out it was Fletcher 's own stock . " Worse and More of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one bad spot . after another developed  --  frozen credits , and so on  --  we began to hear all sorts of gossip about Fletcher 's huge commitments . Having in mind the common welfare , the leading banking house in the Street asked Fletcher about it . Fletcher replied that he had very few commitments . " A few days later Fletcher telephoned the bankers , asking for an interview . It was then about six P.M. ; but after listening to what Fletcher passengers by sight . A newcomer was an item of interest . to me , and I watched him closely his first few months to see if he were learning how to commute . I he reached the station in time and in good humor ; if he could manage a newspaper without getting it . all mussed up and without too much waving of the arms in the process ; if he refrained from talking to his fellow passengers when they were reading , working or trying to sleep ; if he could find his ticket without hunting through all his pockets ; if he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his destination ; if he was perfectly shameless about the parcels he carried , feeling free to come into the train with a. lawn mower , a watermelon , a scythe , an armful of rosebushes or a statue of Winged Victory , I 'd say to myself , " He 'll do . " I was glad to have him on my train . But if he could not master the technic of newspaper reading in crowded quarters ; if he sat stiffly and muttered to himself when he could not locate his ticket ; if his face registered gloom day after day , I 'd tell my wife  --  I live in New Canaan ? " We have a new neighbor , but he does n't like us . " The World 's Worst Commuter There was at one of my stops a few years ago a man of high standing who was the worst commuter I ever had . His doctor sent him out from the city because he could not sleep there . He told me he hated trains , flowers , dogs , the sound of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , it was decided to meet . that same night . The bankers consulted Ivith the group of war millionaires who had bought . into UM at Fletcher 's solicitation . They met at Fletcher 's office that night and discussed the situation . Of course all knew that if Fletcher were forced to liquidate it would mean a crash that would bankrupt dozens of firms . One of the men present asked Fletcher for an itemized statement , and what Fletcher disclosed was enough to make everybody present realize that the situation was infinitely worse than they had feared . You see , he not only would buy UM for himself by the tens of thousands of shares but he would guarantee friends ' accounts . We finally got from him a perfectly appalling list of commitments . " I remember , when we had added up about twenty-five or thirty accounts , I asked him : Is this all , Mr. Fletcher ? ' " He looked at me meditatively and answered : N-no . I think there is  - -  - 1 He opened a. drawer in his desk and brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " ' Is that all , Mr. Fletcher ? ' " ' N-no ! ' He opened another drawer , pulled out another paper and said pleasantly : Here are 35,000 shares more with Blank Bros . ' " We kept . on asking him for more and he kept on giving them to us until we found he had accounts with forty-four different brokerage houses that were carrying for him on margin more than 3,000,000 shares . His paper profits at . the peak must . have been enormous . He had seen them melt . away , but . did not dream of selling . Well , we formed a syndicate and ( Continued from Page 24 ) all he hated early rising . He rode with me for a year or more , but never learned to relax , read , sleep or work on the train . The time he spent in riding was wasted except , for getting him to and from his office . Good commuters , you know , never waste their riding time . I do not know what became of this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I often hope his health improved sufficiently to permit him to return to New York and live in a nice noisy apartment . close to Broadway . Another strikingly unsuccessful commuter used to board my train at . one of the stops between New Canaan and New York . In summer he was a fair passenger , but in winter he was awful . He could not stand the fine blasts of fresh air which come into a car when the doors are opened at stations , and he seemed to think that we opened those doors for the main purpose of bothering him . Each morning he boarded the same car and went to the same seat . Many commuters do that , for they are a. ha.bitual lot . Upon reaching his seat he removed his hat and placed it in the rack above . He next removed his scarf and put that in the rack . Finally he took off his overcoat , folded it carefully and stowed it , away . These were the first three acts of his daily comedy . With a scowl he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as the next stop was just about three minutes along . The doors of the car would be opened , of course , and the cold air would come rushing in . The man would glare at the incoming passengers , rise from his seat , shove up toagreed to take over his holdings at an average price of twelve dollars a share , which was one heck of a drop from the top . It was below the market , of course . Fletcher was the coolest man in the room . We said we would liquidate his line and pay Fletcher a share of the profits , if any . I want to tell you that even then he could n't see why that stock should n't sell above 8100 a share . He said anybody who bought it would make huge profits . And he was dead right . We gave him an option . on some large blocks of his own stock at 30 or 35 and later on he made millions by exercising his option . But the night we took him over he was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Fletcher He never regained the presidency of the corporation he had formed , but he played an important . part in the bull market a few years later as an individual and by inducing important capitalists to become a-s bullish as he . In 1928 , Fletcher admitted for publication that he had made more than $100,000,000 on the bull side . In the spring of 1929 he was reported to have dropped $35,000,000 in two offices  --  and he had accounts in several . Later he lost more . In any event , he overstayed his market , as he had done before , for all the world like one of the pikers who never stop whining about a 810,000 loss . The game g-iveth and the game taketh away . And the game is going to keep on taking away  --  from rich and poor , from wise and foolish  --  for in the stock market there is neither wise nor foolish  --  only losers ; only foolish . In 1931 at least , six multimillionaires could show greater individual losses than Fletcher's. the door and slam it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the second he would put . on his hat , then slam the door . At the third he would have his hat and scarf on before slamming the door , and by the time the final stop was reached he had his overcoat. on and was mad all through . His fury never abated until he had left . i he train at Grand Central . The regular passengers enjoyed his program . of anger , and so did I. But I never tried to torment him , as some passengers did , by leaving the doors open longer than necessary . The Technic of the Flirt There was nothing I could do about these persons whose temperaments unfitted them for successful commuting . They were victims of their own lack of self-control and , fortunately , did not disturb their fellow passengers . But there are a few commuters who make themselves nuisances to others , and these I watched very closely . The most obnoxious of all was the girl hunter . Everyone knows him . He looks the girls over as they come to the train , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seat beside some girl who strikes his fancy . He takes his seat beside a girl and offers her his newspaper , or a book , or perhaps makes some silly comment on the weather . Usually she pays no attention to him . He thou may drop his newspaper or his ticket on the floor  --  anything will serve that gives him an excuse for leaning over against her as he retrieves what he has dropped . His conduct is not often overt enough
