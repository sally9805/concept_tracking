The most-talked-of political clique in 1938 was the " Cliveden Set , " the name applied to a group of eminent Britons who frequented Cliveden , Buckinghamshire estate of Lord &; Lady Astor . Occasional visitors to Cliveden are Prime Minister &; Mrs. Neville Chamberlain ; Montagu Norman , Governor of the Bank of England ; Geoffrey Dawson , ' editor of the potent London Times , which is owned by Lady Astor 's brother-in-law . Major John Jacob Astor ; and Colonel &; Mrs. Charles Augustus Lindbergh . <P> To certain Clivedenites Lindbergh reputedly delivered his reputedly damaging remarks on the Russian Air Force which reputedly scared the British Government out of sticking up for Czechoslovakia . The " Cliveden Set " became a synonym for a sort of Fifth Column working on behalf of Germany behind the back of the British Government .

I loathe dictators and all they stand for . The most horrible thing Hitler has done is to warp the lives of Jewish children . Is n't it awful we ca n't tell what this lunatic is going to do next ?
