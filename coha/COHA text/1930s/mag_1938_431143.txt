 | Black Omens Condensed from The Saturday Evening Post Stanley High Harlem among American Negro communities , is tops . And tops in Harlem is Sugar Hill . When Sugar 14111 goes to church it does not join the middle-class throngs that mill into the Abyssinian Baptist Church - the nation 's largest Negro church ; it worships in Episcopalian St. Philip 's or St. Martin 's . When it chooses to dance at the Savoy it rents the whole place , leaving the excluded proletariat to stare from the sidewalk . Sugar Hill , in these matters , is set off above its surroundings no more than Enright Street , St. Louis , or the swankier Negro area of West Philadelphia , or the few select blocks on Chicago 's South Parkway . In every northern Negro center , social standing has been hard to win ; therefore the joys of exclusiveness are tasted to the full . But within the last zo years , a succcssion of shocks and a barrage , , I propaganda have brought uppercrust Negro society and the lower levels closer to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not been wiped out . But politcally and economically they have been shaken together . The forces which are uniting the present-day Negro community are potent and portentous . Negro solidarity is approaching . It is not possible to say where the Negroes of the North are going , but wherever it is , they will go together . That fact makes one of the nation 's largest political question marks , as the unprecedented deference of the boss politicians of both parties to the Black Belt voter demonstrates . It provides , also , one of the rosiest of the hopes that Communism lives by . In New York it has already proved the mainstay of the American Labor Party . In certain industries it is the most important force in the drive of organized labor . In short , the Negroes of the North , as the result of their developing solidarity , have been pushed squarely into the middle of our political and economic whirlpools . Some of the shocks that have sped this development have been severe . That was the case in Harlem . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is today - a relief city , a jobless waste , an itinerant prophet named Sufi Abdul  | Hamid preached to the unemployed , demanding Harlem jobs for Harlem people . He called upon white store owners , " taking the Negroes ' money , " to employ Negro help . When nothing happened he urged a boycott which caused much bitterness . That was the situation when , on March zg , zg3S , a dusky Puerto Rican boy was caught lifting a tencent penknife from the counter of a white-owned department store . Two floorwalkers carried him away , kickin ' , and screaming . Some 500 Negro customers got a fleeting glimpse of a black boy being hustled off by white men and , before the corner policeman could arrive , they had pretty well torn the place to pieces . Word passed down Seventh Avenue that a Negro boy was being beaten to death . By nightfall most of Harlem was screaming through the streets , and before morning scores of persons were injured , some killed , and block after block of white store windows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York in 35 years . Harlem has not been the same place since . While the rioting was on , upper-class Negroes went down the hill to see the excitement . A good many of them got their first inkling of what was stirring in the minds of Harlem 's masses . Some grabbed the handbills that the Communists , with customary foresight , were distributing , and Joined the agitators . As it turned out , no harm befell the Puerto Rican boy , but the outbreak he set off left Harlem a more united community than it had ever been before . Not only in Harlem but in every large northern center of Negro population , mass meetings , mass picketings , labor parades and soapbox oratory have become commonplace . The Negro is out for a new place in the sun . He does not expect to get it , like Emancipation , on a silver platter . He plans to make or take it for himself . One reason the Negro is out for a new place in the sun . is that he has found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Negro center of population was in northeastern Alabama . In the next 2o years almost one fourth of the 12,000,00o Negroes in the U. S. , lured by cash-money jobs , joined in a northward trek ; and they changed not only the whole pattern of Negro life in the North but the character of the Northern Negro . Before 1910 the Northern Negro was not very different from the Southern . He probably worked in a white man 's household. , and the more exclusive Negro society was made up of the butlers , chauffeurs and ladies ' maids who had the more exclusive positions . Save for the preacher , the only professional Negro whom he regarded as of any consequence was the undertaker. lie went to white doctors when he was ill and to white lawyers when he was in trouble . Booker T. Washington was his prophet , and Wash-  | ington 's counsel to " put down your bucket where you are , " his philosophy . In politics he firmly believed the statement of Frederick Douglass , the first great Negro political leader , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is open sea . " The church was the cornerstone of the community , and the preachers , unvexed by social problems , preached the old-time religion . The pre-migration Negro of the North " knew his place , " and , smiling , patient and tractable , he kept it . Then came the migration , and by 1930 the Negro population of Chicago had increased 430 percent ; of Detroit , 2813 percent ; of New York City , 257 percent . In zgao there was no city with more than zoo , ooo Negroes . In. 1930 there were seven . These migrants - broke , jobless , unskilled - knocked the bottom out of the lowest economic level of the cities to which they came . In the matter of food , fuel , and particularly shelter , life was generally worse by a good deal than it had been in the South . The new population found the only areas into which it could move already overcrowded . The congestion that resulted was worse than that of the worst tenement districts . White tenement owners took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far as I know , no northern city in which the Negroes are not obliged to pay considerably more for poorer quarters than any other section of the population . Negro tenants in Chicago , for example ; pay from $8 to $2o a month for the same room for which previous white tenants had paid $q. to $5 . Day and night , Sundays and holidays , the streets of the Black Belts are always full of people . Detroit 's Paradise Valley is as much awake at 2 A.M. as at high noon . Harlem hardly ever starts dancing before z a o'clock , and no one would think of showing up at a party before midnight . In other words , in the average Negro neighborhood , no one wants to go home . The streets , the pool and dance halls , the lodge rooms and all manner of less legitimate hangouts are far more cheer-ICU All this overcrowding has had disastrous consequences . Tuberculosis among Negro children is from two to five times that of white children . In New York the number of arrests of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five times ahead of that for whites . The intelligence levels in the northern communities suffered . The incoming Negroes brought their superstitions with them . " Bush-arbor " preachers created new sects in almost every block : The Metaphysical Church of the Divine Investigation , The Triumph Church , The Church of the Believers of the Commandments , the Sanctuaries of Mother Horne , the Heavens of Father Divine . Even more dubious faiths appeared . There is admittedly  | a large amount of voodoo worship ; and the voodoo preachers , on the side , generally carryon a lively trade in policy numbers and sell magic in all forms . There was , for a time , a more hopeful side to the picture . With America 's entrance into the World War , it looked as though the floodgates of economic opportunity were at last to be opened to the Negro . There was steadily increasing employment for him , at improving wages , in steel , iron , coal and automobiles . Employers appeared to have a growing confidence in his workmanship , and he developed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period as the Second Emancipation . In 1929 , however , this brave new world came abruptly to an end . What has happened since is best summed up in the phrase that one hears wherever Negroes talk about their economic plight : " We 're the last hired and the first fired . " With the depression , the number of white men available for unskilled jobs greatly increased and the Negro was displaced . White men even invaded those fields which the Negro had looked upon as peculiarly his , and became bootblacks , porters , servants and waiters . Today , in every considerable northern center , from 35 to 45 percent of all Negro families are on relief . The hope for a second Emancipation at the end of the trek to the North has disappeared . The Negroes are still on the move . But this time their shift is not geographical . It is social , political and economic . As a result , the Negro himself - in both his temper and his objectives - is very different from the docile servant of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the white man 's nigger . " He may revere the name of Booker T. Washington , but he has little use for Washington 's counsel . He is grateful for the benefactions of such philanthropists as the late Julius Rosenwald , but the mention of John L. Lewis will get a bigger hand from the average Negro audience . The Negro community is more cut off than ever before from the white man 's world . The Negro . now takes his pains or his problems to a doctor or lawyer of his own race . He buys his burial insurance from a colored salesman for a colored company . He may make it a point to shop only at stores which employ Negro help . Politically he votes in the column from which , in terms of visible returns , he is likely to get the most . The transformation in the northern Negro community is probably nowhere better illustrated than in the changes under way among Negro churches . In many of them the gospel is not greatly different from that preached on street corners or in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ minister of the Abyssinian Baptist Church in  | Harlem , pointed one Sunday morning to his audience of 200o and remarked to me : " Most of them would be as much at home on a picket line as they are in church . " When I visited one of the largest Negro churches in Chicago , there was a huge sign beside the entrance . The first sentence read : " What must we do to be saved ? " The answer was not , in the usual sense , religious : " Beset by Rent Hogs . Overcrowded in Hovels . Come to the Housing Mass Meeting on Thursday Noon . The United Front . " In a Negro discussion group in Detroit I heard a young Negro preacher assert : " In terms of the economic needs of our people , the Negro church , up to now , has been an antisocial institution . We 've had enough of the gospel of dem golden slippers . ' What we want is the gospel of thick-soled shoes . " His audience applauded . The migration made the Negro @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ influences , and the depression has led him to give ear to them . This combination accounts for his developing solidarity , for the fact that Sugar Hill has begun to make common cause with the sidewalk orators who offer their doctrines in the Lung Blocks . If there is a place in the sun for the Negro , this - in the Negro 's opinion - is his only chance to get it .
