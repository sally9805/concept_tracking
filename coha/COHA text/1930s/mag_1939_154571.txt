When the McKesson &; Robbins scandal broke last December , jittery stockholders feared that their drug firm might be busted . Approximately one fourth of its $86,556,270 assets was just figures written on the books to keep the company looking prosperous while imposing Impostor F. Donald Coster milked it . Trustee William J. Wardall , appointed by the U. S. District Court to straighten out the mess , last week mailed to stockholders his first full report of the firm 's financial condition : <P> In the first five months of 1939 McKesson &; Robbins made a net profit from operation of $1,336,627 ( compared to $271,752 the year before ) . <P> By the end of 1938 Musica-Coster had inflated the firm 's assets by $21,025,658 . Of this amount $2,869,483 was stolen from the firm . The rest had never existed to be stolen , was an incidental figment of the Coster speculation . Ex phony items : assets on Dec. 31 , 1938 were $68,953,095 ; liabilities , $41,657,064 ; net worth , $27,296,031 . <P> McKesson earnings ( years ending Dec. 31 ) : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 3,667,325 2,313,662 <P> 1938 1,376,694 <P> Recovered to date : $235,000 ( including $100,000 insurance policy on Musica-Coster 's life ) .
