Jews of high standing in Italy , and there are many , were given sudden hope last week by an unexpected passage in Il Duce 's speech at Trieste , most of which was devoted to possibilities of war ( see p. 15 ) . Although declaring that " World Jewry , during sixteen years , has been an irreconcilable enemy of Fascism , " Premier Mussolini added , " Jews of Italian citizenship , however , possessing indisputable military and civic merits toward Italy and the Regime , will find understanding and justice ! As for the other Jews , a policy of separation will be followed . In the end the world , perhaps , will be surprised more at our generosity than at our severity ! " <P> This confirmed the impression produced by Italy 's first anti-Semitic decree , which was limited to excluding the 20,000 Jews who have entered Italy since the War . Eager to please the Dictator , many Italian employers have been firing Jews , many Jews have fearfully resigned important posts . Last week it was learned that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the People 's Gazette of Turin , wrote directly to Premier Mussolini , asking if the Dictator had ever issued orders for Jewish journalists to be booted from their jobs . Promptly the Premier gave the Turin Gazette 's editor a wigging , and rehired was Meritorious Jew Moravia . <P> Before the Dictator somewhat clarified his attitude at Trieste last week , Jewish President Arnaldo Frigessi Di Ratalma " voluntarily resigned " as head of this great port 's biggest insurance firm Riunione Adriatica , which elected as his successor non-Jewish Fulvio Suvich , Italian Ambassador to the U. S. who is now in Italy . Jewish President Edgardo Morpurgo of Assicurazioni Generali , the great Venetian insurance firm , likewise resigned last week and was replaced by famed Count Volpi , who in 1925 as Finance Minister negotiated the Italo-U . S. debt accord . Swank Countess Volpi is a Jewess and so is the old mother of Fascist Minister of Education Giuseppe Bottai . Indeed , so many Jews of long standing in Italy hold places in or close to the Regime and seem to be such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the first that his anti-Semitism was chiefly a bluffing gesture to impress the Fhrer and to curry a little favor from Islam to keep the British worried in Palestine .
