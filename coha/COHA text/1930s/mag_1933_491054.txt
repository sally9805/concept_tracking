C AR MOT ? were coming off the high mountains , traveling down to the timber-sheltered flats below in long , winding strings . Ravens were flying back and forth , squawking their warning calls . while I played a tune on the woodpile with the old crosscut saw , for long before the break of day the wolves had given their Arctic-blizzard howl . A black bank frowned threateningly down out of the northern sky upon the jagged mountain peaks and dismal pla teaus , and light gusts of wind raced one another down the snowy hollows and roared in the tops of the spruce trees . Each follow  --  ing gust was a little stronger , and the snow began to blow from the sharp points and knobs of the hills . As the wind increased , the fine frosty snow whirling throueh the icy air cut off all vision . The blizzard was upon us . The tremendous wind and snow continued for three days and nights . The velocity of the wind was so great that it not only caused the giant spruce trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but it twisted off many of the largest branches and crashed to the ground some of the largest trees in the forest . Many times we expected one of the giant trees that stood in the yard to blow over on our little home and crush it in on us . The terrific , impelling wind and snow were also mixed with a dense fog , so heavy you could not see your hand at arm 's length . For safety first , we re  --  sorted to the old pioneer trick if tying a rope to the cabin door and holding it in hand on leaving the cabin to feed the dogs and do our other chores . Tales are numerous of old prospectors venturing out in bad blizzards for a necessary bueket of water , never to find their way hack to the cabin again . On the third night of the blizzard , a few hours be  --  fore the break of day , the wind seemed to reach a climax . Many branches broken from trees were whirled against our cabin . 01IP heavy limb crashed upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lapped down on the side of the cabin , where icicles had formed on the eaves from snow melting about the stovepipe . It slapped these icicles against the cello-glass window with a loud crash . It did not break the window , but I found myself standing in the center of the cabin floor by the time I was really awake . The Night of the Big Wind I CRAWLED back into bed . but had lost all desire to sleep . I lay quiet and listened to the hewLing storm . Many cold winter nights I have been forced to siwash it out while in I he North , and some of these nights were now recalled to my mind . I was con  --  gratulating myself on being within shelter this awful night when , with a loud bring , soniethieg slammed against the shed porch of the cabin . Then , after a few moments of preternatural silence , a faint moan sounded , as if some half-unconscious person had fallen at our door . I sat up in bed to listen , for I was positive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ travel of us , and that would mean the crossing of three mountain ranges . There came another crash , and the peculiar noise grew louder and louder , with choking and strangling sounds . I could clearly detect that it was not made by any of our dogs ; moreover , I knew they were all chained and fastened in separate kennels . The gruesome noise became more mournful , and the choking sobs clearly convinced me that they came from a human being in great agony . Some poor , lost wanderer , I decided , had become exhausted from fighting his way in the storm and had fallen prostrate at our door . I jumped out of bed , grabbed the flash light and rushed to the door . As / swung it open a heavy gust of wind and snow poured in on me , but I flashed the light about the yard . The only things I could see were some large branches anchored against the porch . I felt . certain they had caused the loud bang , but they could not have made the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing more in sight , and , with the cold wind and flying snow sweeping in on me in my night clothes and over my bare feet , I soon decided to close the door . I hardly had time to get back into bed when the moaning , choking and groaning noise was again re  --  peated , if possible more hideous than before . I stepped into some house shoes and pulled on a. bath robe , for I was now determined to find out what was making the pitiful sounds . Slipping hack to the door , with the flash light turned off , I soon learned the mournful noise was not on the ground at the door , but above and a little to one side of it . The Arctic Visitor AFTERAFTER I was certain of its location , I opened the and flashed the light on the place where I thought the sounds had come from , and to my sur  --  prise two large eyes glared into mine . I stepped back , for I was sure they were the eyes of a great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another moment I discovered that the creature was a large Arctic white owl , sitting on top of a slab gun cabinet that I had built under the porch to hold our guns and binoculars . During the cold winters in the North , guns and glasses are not brought into the house , where there is a warm fire , for they not only sweat and form rust on account of the change from the intense cold to the warm room but when taken out into weather far below zero , the glasses will fog and the guns will sometimes freeze so they can not be worked . This largo Arctic white owl had found the cozy little nook on top of the cabinet in under the porch , and he was only hooting , or rather mumbling to himself in a pitiful way , but the bright light I had flashed into his eyes seemed to frighten him and he darted out from under the porch and was swallowed by the storm . With the break of day the terrible storm began to show signs of dying down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blast and lulling briefly . Each repeated violent bluster was like the dying effort of some ferocious beast , for each struggle was lasting a shorter time than the one that had pre  --  ceded it , and the lulls were lingering a little longer . I sat waiting for the blizzard to give its last gasp . As soon as I was sure it had ended , / put on some heavy clothes , grabbed the snow scoop , and started out to do the necessary trail making about the cabin and yard that always follows a bad storm . As I opened the door a cold blast of air hit the warm air in the room , causing a frosty fog to whirl about me and settle down to the floor . My first view of the outdoors showed the high mountain tops to be still veiled with dark , hazy , gray clouds that reached almost down to their mid-sides . The spruce forest now hung si  --  lent and lifeless un  --  der its heavy white mantle . After one of these terrible Arctic storms one always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hostile environment of such a. cold , bleak desolation . Over the voiceless sea of white silence now brooded a eh astly calmness , and the cold air gradually changed to that of a spring day . I soon noticed that snow was sticking to the scoop , and this was something unusual during the dead of winter in the interior part of Alaska . Shylock , our lead dog , came out of his kennel and jumped up on top of it and began gazing oil north  --  west , to where a small saddle made a low pass down to the timber from the barren plateau . He had sighted the caribou coming out of the timber in great bands . At one place they dropped out of our sight , but only for a short time . Then they led up over a hill above our cabin , and we could watch them on their journey , north and east , for several miles . We were surprised to see so many of them , for our cabin was located almost at the lower limit of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three hours in large bands , one right after the other , we began to wonder if they were migrating from our country . They seemed to be in a hurry , sometimes breaking into a trot as they traveled with their mouths half open . Our warm air turned into what is called in the north a Chinook wind , and the three feet of light , frosty snow settled down to about ten inches of hard crust , which was almost ice by the time it . froze again . The caribou 's instinct had foretold them what would happen to the wet snow when the cold night came on again , and so they were gone . That night we heard wolves howl in all directions about our cabin , and we knew they were scattered all over the plateaus hunting caribou . But the caribou had made their get-away while the snow was melt  --  ing , and now the heavy thaw , with the new freeze , had wiped out their trails and scent . The next day we hooked up our dog team and be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ carcasses we could find within five miles of our cabin , for five large Malamute dogs dispose of a lot of meat when they are working hard . While bringing in the car  --  casses , we saw through our glasses many small packs of wolves roaming over the great barrens , hunting for the lost trails of the caribou . When Our Meat Supply Walked Out on Us Fr HERE were enough caribou carcasses from early 1 wolf kills lying about over the plateaus to Feed the starving wolves for ten days or two weeks , but the end of that time was at hand and the caribou had not returned . With our glasses we often watched the wolves dig down through the crusted snow in search of old bones , hide and meat that had been left from early slaughters , but it was not . long before every scrap of meat and skin was gone and the bones had been picked and repieked . It is surprising to see how large a bone a wolf can chew and swallow when he is really hungry . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , according to an old proverb , no hunger equals that of it wolf . We suspected that cannibalism was being practiced among them . We did not find any definite proof of it where they were running at liberty , but one stepped in a trap I had set for a wolverine , and all signs indicated that the others of his peek had devoured him immediately . Because of the drop in the market on wolf fur , the territory 's cut , on the wolf bounty , the strange law requiring the trapper to leave one of the front-leg bones attached to the wolf pelt in order to receive the bounty , and also because of the extra weight of the heavy wolf trap to he carried in with es in the airplane , we had not taken any wolf traps with us that year . Wolves always follow the caribou , winter and sum  --  mer , and it was only the freak change in the weather that had made it possible for the caribou to escape them . The migration of the caribou was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was so unexpected that we had neglected laying in our quota of caribou meat . for our winter supply . The ' previous winter , spent in the same locality , had led us to believe that we could kill a caribou any day within one hour 's travel from the cabin . Our meat was almost gone . We had made several trips down into the timbered country hunting for small game , but the best we could find was it porcu  --  pine or two . Our dog team had very little ld ' of the caribou wolf kills we had hauled in for them . We knew that within two or three days ' travel down the big Susitna River we could find some moose , but it would be a hard drag to haul a heavy load back up the river and onto the plateau . We felt certain we could go up the river two or three days and find cari  --  bou on some of the other mountain slopes , where the chinook wind had not crusted the snow , and we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we would have to go somewhere soon and lied meat before our dogs got too weak to pull a heavy load hack , we started up the Su-silos River on the tenth day of January , leaving the trap-line camp nearest to our destination about three hours before the break of day . The Northern Lights lighted our way hotter than the grayish gloom which so often affords the only light during the short days of an Alaskan winter . We traveled as light as possible , hauling one Arctic sleeping robe , made for two , one extra double wool blanket , one six-by-eight canvas tarp , two heavy rifles , one .22 caliber pistol , very little food , as our food supply was low , a few cooking utensils , our two pairs of snowshoes , am  --  munition and medicine kit . It . was a glorious feeling as the dogs went racing over the hard , crusted snow . Mrs , Ruggles was sitting down in the basket sled , and I stood on the runners , where I could work the brake while shouting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Clarence Lake , around the edge of the plateau to Goose Creek , and thence over a small divide to Black River . Now and then we stopped , searching the far mountainsides with our glasses for caribou . An Alry Hotel Room rrIHE first night we camped on the Susitna River , 1 above the mouth of Black River . We selected for our camp site a big spruce tree that stood in a cluster of smaller spruce ; it made an ideal night 's shelter . Using one of my snowshoes for a snow scoop , I cleared out a circle in front of the big tree , about fifteen feet across and down to the frozen ground , so that we could get around camp without snowshoes . Then l dragged in our night 's wood and prepared our morning 's kindling . Taking the little .22 pistol , I hunted down two porcupines . We baked part of one in the coals for our supper and fed the rest to the dogs .

We soon decided to retire , as our early morning start was telling us we had been cut a little short on last night 's sleep . We crawled into our cozy eider-down robe , and with one eye peeping out from under its laps we watched the stars leaping in their frosty dance until we dozed off into a contented slumber , About midnight . we were aroused by our Alialemute dog team giving their saluting howl to the rising moon , which was just peering over the snow-capped peaks of the Susitna range . This great orb , like a monstrous pearl , which rules over the Arctic ' lights , is a godsend to all creatures living where the light of clay is so extremely short .. A few well-directed spruce limbs silenced our night crooners , and all was quiet again . The next morning at an early hour we were up and on our way . We traveled up a ridge on the east side of Valdez Creek , north of Tyone River . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I both mushed it up the long slope to save the strength of the dog team , Each time we stopped to catch our breaths , we scoured the high mountains and the barren plateaus with our glasses , in hopes of seeing a few straggling caribou .

But , unfortu  --  nately  --  or let us at least assume so  --  nobody could hear what it was all about . We settled ourselves in the press gallery for , as the phrase goes , a long winter 's nap . Down on the floor , Sen  --  ator Kean 's distinguished colleagues , as the boys are wont laughingly to dub one another , crept slowly and silently out of the chamber , one by one , the way the orchestra players do in Haydn 's Farewell Symphony . Sena tor Glass , evidently intrigued by a newspaper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his desk about thirty feet away .

We remember wondering whether or not to send a St. Bernard after him . At the end of the first hour or two , hope was aroused when a roguish draft . from the Senate ventilating system frisked playfully about the pile of manuscript on Sen  --  ator hen 's desk , scattering several pages . Bets wore placed as to the like  --  lihood of all the king 's horses and all the king 's men , to say nothing of Sena  --  tor Nears , being able to collect them and go on uninterrupted . We lost . Well , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the next . day , and we read in the paper that what we had thought was just a song at twilight , as you might say , was an " attack " on Senator ( lass 's bill . Senator Glass read it too . The minute the session opened , he was on his feet . As full of vigor and vitriol as when he began his thirty years of splendid service and his hair was red instead of its present gray : his mobile mouth characteristi  --  cally twisted somewhere up around his eyebrows with indignation , swaying with energy in his own peculiar and be  --  guiling snapping-turtle fashion . he  --  guess what ? ? " flayed " Senator Kean for his " attack ' ' ! At least , that 's what the paper said . And there we sat and never knew a thing about it !

The herds of tour  --  ists and honeymoon couples straggling through the marble corridors , at  --  tracted by the sound of his Deep-South - accented bellowing , squeeze through the doors and sink into their gallery seats with obvious relief and pleasure . They may not know the tune , but at . last they can catch on to the words ! Incidentally , and just to show you how wonderfully Nature works in Congress , as elsewhere , Senator Long has come nearer to effecting reforms in the famous Senate cloture rules than any other man of his day and genera  --  tion . It was ex-Vice-President Dawes ' cherished dream to limit the Senate debates he had to listen to . But he never succeeded in altering the rule . Since Senator Long 's fantastic daily-dozen performances , however , there has been more talk in the Senate cloak  --  room concerning this change than during Dawes ' entire reign .

But a Democracy has to take its senators as it finds them . That , in a measure , is the real story of Congress . It is your Congress . It is made up of men just as good and just as mediocre and just as bad as we are who sent them there . Just as hard-working , just as lazy , just as earnest , just as stupid , just as greedy , just as vain , just as stubborn , just as patriotic , just as decent . Men  --  just men . Or , if you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what it is today . If we do n't like it , we know what we can do . But , personally , we just love it ! HUNG2Ir WOLVNO ( COMeinood from Page About eleven o'clock we readied the top of a rather high hogback , and we could see clearly much of the upper Susitna flats that had been hidden from our view . We halted the dog team upon a level spot , where I could use the sled for a rest while holding my binocu  --  lars , for they were twelve power and very hard to hold steady . About six miles almost due east of us , we could make out some kind of dark objects moving slowly about on the snow . In the hazy gloom they did not look like caribou ; yet they were scattered and moved about so slowly that we felt certain they were not wolves . Thinking they might possibly be caribou . we both hopped on the sled and headed our dogs down off the hogback toward the level barrens . The moment we got off this little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and we traveled only by directions un  --  til we were within three-quarters of a mile of the objects we had seen . We came up out of some small breaks onto the level plateau , and here our last hopes for meat were shattered , for we could now plainly see nine wolves ahead of us , some sitting down , some lying down , and others moving alsout in a large circle . After our disappoint  --  ment , I had just shouted " gee " to the lead dog , intending to turn him back down to the big Susitna River , when I noticed three ravens coming over the spot where the wolves were stationed . They began flying about in a small circle at a fairly low elevation , squawk  --  ing as loud as they could . I knew they had seen something unusual , and from the manner in which the wolves had been moving about , I felt sure they had made a fresh kill . I told Mrs. Ruggles we would go over to them , as we might find some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wolves , and we had scarcely traveled two hun  --  dred yards when our dog team sighted them . It was now a little downhill and the team pulled us with breakneck speed . As the wolves did not seem much interested in us and it looked as if we were going to get close enough for a shot , Mrs. Ruggles unrolled our rifles and handed me one . Meantime we were gliding within range . The wolves had been scattered wide circle , hat upon seeing us coming they gathered in a huddled group . Mrs. Ruggles leaned back flat on the sled while I squatted on the extended ends of the runners behind the sled ; the See dogs were about the only thing the wolves could see . We were within a little less than two hundred yards of them before they showed signs of leav  --  ing . I slapped the brake of the sled down into the crusted snow with a force that halted the dogs instantly . Mrs. Ruggles rolled out on the crusted snow , where the lunging dogs would not interfere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our guns , firing as rapidly as we could . After four or five shots apiece , two wolves lay dead on the snow , and two others showed signs of being badly hurt. , but they managed to get away . In the Nick of Time Then came the greatest surprise of our lives . A man appeared on the snow in plain sight , within two hundred yards of where we had been shouting at the huddled group of wolves . As he waved his hands and shouted , the agonizing conviction came over us that we had killed some poor old trapper 's Malemute dogs , for many of those Northern dogs are so highly crossed with wolf blood that they are hard to tell from wolves at the distance we had been shooting . We jumped onto the sled and raced the dogs up to the man , who was now stumbling along to meet us . He was a young Eskimo , about twenty-five years of age , and lie spoke good Eng  --  lish . I doubt if any human being was ever happier at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God , people ! " he shouted . " My companion is in the glacier pit , " ? a small depression in the earth ? " and I think lie is dying ! Can you do any  --  thing for him ? " We rushed down into the bottom of the pit , and over in one side of the de  --  pression , where the snow was the deep  --  est , we saw a hole in the bank with snow packed about the entrance , so as to leave an opening just large enough so that we could crawl in on hands and knees . I entered first into a neat little room built in under the deep snow . Mrs. Ruggles came in after me , and we found the young fellow 's companion nut . of his head and talking very loud , but as he spoke in Eskimo , we could not tell what he was saying . Seven different tongues are spoken among the natives of Alaska . Their little snow room was scented with a peculiar odor . The young fellow , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side , and I asked him what was causing the terrible odor . He replied , " It is poor Dan 's leg , which is badly torn . " They did not have any bedding or extra wraps of any kind , and this poor sick fellow was rolling around in his snow bed . with a terribly high fever . He was certainly a sad sight . I told . Joe , " We will have to get this poor man down to where there is some timber and make a good fire for him , for as soon ILA his fever leaves he will freeze . " ' We brought down our dog team , and Mrs. Ruggles prepared the sleeping robe , while Joe and I carried the sick man out and put him in the robe and covered him up well . We then beaded down to the first timber we could get to . We traveled southwest for about two miles to where we had noticed a deep canyon with much spruce timber . Mrs. Ruggles rode on the runners of the sled and handled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along be  --  hind . Arrived in the thick timber , I picked out a good camp place . Leaving Dan on the sled , the rest of us began to gather wood and make a fire . " Look here , " Joe cried presently , " at the marks on this tree . " A minute later we noticed some stumps , and then we knew someone had been in the locality with an ax . During the gold-rush days of ' 98 the stampeders prospected and built cab  --  ins in many parts of the Alaskan wil  --  derness . The Eskimos and trappers have learned , while traveling through unknown country , to keep a good watch-out for old cabins for a night 's shelter . I suggested that Joe scout up the canyon while I looked down it for an old hut . Sure enough , we were only two hundred yards above a substantial little shack . We hooked the dogs up again and pulled down to it . The contents of the cabin half told a story that will always baffle me . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No. 10 shotgun , its breech open , with two empty brass shells and three loaded shells close by . The other was a .32 single-shot rifle , unloaded , and sev  --  eral empty shells near it also , The table was set in the center of the cabin , with three plates , knives , forks , cups and a few other empty dishes , just . as if it had been prepared for dinner . An old , rusty stove sat in the corner of the cabin , the pipe rusted down . On the stove were a teakettle , frying pan , stewer , and a pot . containing something that we thought might have been beans at one time , but was now like dried sealing wax . There were three hunks in the cabin , with the bedding left , in them . The rats and mice , with the help of the leaking roof , had ruined them so they were almost like carpet raga . Everything indicated that the cabin had been left with a few minutes ' notice . Gold  --  Rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but we found only one can of rice that was still eatable ; it was in a press-top can under a dishpan . A baking-powder can contained five blocks of old California sulphur matches still in good order . In one corner of the room were three old gold rockers , to  --  gether with mining tools , saws , axes and some carpenter tools . Our guess was that the cabin had been vacated more than twenty years ago . We tired up the stovepipe by wrap  --  ping some of the tin cans around it . There was plenty of sawed wood , split and ricked in the cabin . We soon had a good hot fire and plenty of warm wa  --  ter , and we started to work on poor Dan , who had been very quiet in his warm bed . We undressed him and found his log had been badly ripped , The smell of the blood that had run ( Continued on Pate 38 ) 36 THE SIITURDAY ( Continued from Page 34 ) down in his moccasin was almost un  --  bearable . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I do not think it . had . The wounded man had a large kernel in his groin . In addition to the injury , Dan had contracted a severe case of influenza . Mrs. Ruggles did not mind helping me bathe and care for Dan 's wound , but she did not want Joe looking on ; so I sent him with the dog team to bring in the two wolves that still lay on the snow where we had shot them . Dan was all cleaned up and his wound dressed with some good antiseptics , and he was sleeping soundly , by the time Joe got back . The dead wolves proved to be very large . The wolves that follow the caribou herds are nearly twice as large as those of Southeastern Alaska that feed on rabbits , fish and deer from the islands . An Eskimo Epic We were not long in getting some  --  thing to eat . . Joe said that he and Dan had not tasted food since the night be  --  fore , and then a very little . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which we always carried in our medicine kit , and some hot coffee . The rest of us fared pretty well on what We found in what Mrs. Ruggles called ' jr emergency sack . After we had fin-'sled our dinner , Joe gave us a coher  --  ent account of how he and Dan came to he in the glacier pit encircled by wolves . They had put in the winter on the north fork of the Militia River , trap  --  ping and snaring fox and lynx . They did fairly well up until the time the chinook wind came and crusted the snow . Then the rabbits , ptarmigan and caribou left the country , and within a day or two the fur followed . They had decided to move over on the north side of the Alaska range , thinking the snow there might have been protected from the chinook wind . Loading their fur and supplies on a one-dog sled , they traveled up the north fork of the Taz  --  lina River , over a low divide loco the Nelchina flats , over another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Tyone River . They traveled four days before reaching Tyone River Canyon , the banks of which are very steep and about one-quarter of a mile deep . The dog was hooked on to the end of a twelve-foot rope fastened to the sled . Dan was walking between the dog and the sled in order to guide the sled with the gee pole . He had a rope over one shoulder and around his body so that he could help pull . Joe had a rope fastened onto the rear end of the sled , and was walking behind holding the tiled bark , for a one-dog sled is built so light that it , is seldom equipped with a brake . They had made their way down the steep canyon wall within one hundred feet . of Tyone River , when they came out upon some ice that had formed on the hillside from a spring . The sled made a quick lunge ahead that jerked Joe down and tore the rope from his grip . Dan held his feet and was sliding down the hill on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When he saw that he could not stop it , he tried to free himself from the rope around his body ; he lost his footing and , as the sled jerked him down , his leg struck an old spruce snag .

The dog was out in front of the sled , running as fast as he could , trying to EVENING POST keep it from overtaking him . Both were making straight down the steep hillside toward an open hole in the ice under a waterfall . The dog was within twenty feet of the hole in the ice before be saw it . He made a quick turn to one side , but the sled had so much mo  --  mentum that it swept right on into the open hole . As Dan tried to get to his feet , he noticed a terrible stinging iu his leg . Seeing the sled in the open hole , and knowing it would suck down in under the ice and take the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fast as he could and grabbed the harness on the dog just as the sled went under the ice . The force of the water on the sled was dragging Dan and the dog right into the water hole . Dan began to yell for Joe , who started running down the hill as fast as he could . When . Joe saw there was no chance of saving the loaded sled , he rut the lead rope just in time to save Dan and the dog from being dragged down into the death hole . The dog , after getting out on safe ground , licked Dan in the face and ran up to Joe and licked his hand . He seemed to know the boys had saved his life . Dan said , " Our winter 's fur is gone ! " Joe replied , " Yes , and our food and rifles are gone too !

Dan had fallen on his own knife , but as soon as Dan ex  --  plained his injury , Joe built a good fire and from his pocket pulled out an old sugar sack that they had . wrapped up their noon lunch in , and began to dress the injured leg . It was a terrible gash , just below the knee , on the inside of the leg . He bandaged it very carefully , but was unable to stop the flowing blood . Joe suggested that they build a little lean-to and camp right there for a few days , for he knew they could find plenty of porcupines in the timber , and that the injured leg would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not hurt ' very badly and in  --  sisted upon going on .

The Red Trail They climbed out the opposite side of the canyon and had just reached the rim of the plateau when Dan began to complain of the bandage being too tight . They stopped , and Joe readjusted it ; the cut was still bleeding freely . They gazed down the hill to where they had built the fire , and saw blue smoke rising in a spiral up through the green spruce . Joe 's eyes then fell on the bloodstained trail from Dan 's leg ; the granulated snow was cutting the frozen blood from trouser leg and moccasin . Joe knew that Dan must be weakening very fast , and asked him once more to return to the fire , but Dan was still determined to go on . They headed across the barren plateau @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1933 the nearest timbered canyon . The bandage on Dan 's leg was interfering with its circulation , and be told Joe his leg was getting cold . They stopped again , and Joe cut the wolf-fur collar from his own parka and wrapped it about Dan 's leg , and they started off again , but Dan was beginning to lag . Joe was very anxious to reach the next canyon , for he knew he would have much to do in preparing their camp . Suddenly there was a break in the cold silence . A weird , mournful sound rang out in the frosty air . It almost stopped the pounding hearts of the two Eskimos , for they recognized at once the meaning of the weeping clamor , and they could picture themselves torn , mangled and eaten by a ravenous pack of wolves . The weird sound was the blood cry , or the hunt call , of a wolf pack , and from its direction the boys knew the wolves were on Dan 's blood  --  stained trail . The Eskimos , as well as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and shrink from the sovereignty of the blood cry . What the Indian war cry was to the poor lonely settler on the plains in early days , the blood cry of the wolf is to the wounded beast of the silent wilderness that is leaving behind a bloodstained trail . The Wolf Call The hunt call , or blood cry , is never given except during a time of famine among wolves . When the mournful sound is sent out it brings together in one pack all the wolves that are within hearing , as the bugle call rallies soldiers on a battlefield . Each wolf , upon hear  --  ing the summoning howl , answers with the same call ; this response relays the cry for a great distance . When the hunt call , or the blood cry , of the wolf has once been heard , it is never mistaken for any other wolf howl , and from in  --  stinct every wounded animal knows his trail will be followed to the end . The Eskimos ? were about halfway across the little plateau . Many thoughts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wolves attacking their tribes . According to often-told tales , Eskimos besieged by wolves have many times saved themselves by get  --  ting their backs to a cliff or glacier , so that the wolves could not get behind thorn , and staring the brutes in the eyes until they were rescued . Poor Joe and Dan had no chance of getting their backs against any kind of wall on this level plateau . Once more the blood cry was sent out , much nearer and stronger in volume , and distant , faint answers responded . The boys now noticed Cowow , their dog , growling , snarling and turning his head first over one shoulder and then the other . His bristles were standing up almost the full length of his back . They both thought it very strange that he should make such a fuss about hear  --  ing a pack of wolves howl , for he had heard them howl at least once a week all his life and he had never given them any notice before . Was it possible Cowow understood the blood cry of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Dan 's nervous ex  --  citement ? Why should he not know the meaning of the blood cry ? In his . own veins flowed the blood of a wolf . During the mating season four years ago his mother had been tied out in the wilderness so that she might be crossed with a wolf . This cross-breeding has been practiced among the Eskimos for a long , long time ; they are continu  --  ously trying to develop a stronger and ( Continued on Page 381 98 Y OU mothers will he delighted at the way your youngsters take to this crispy , delicious-tasting breakfast food .

Cowow showed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and coat were like a wolf 's and his feet were padded with coarse fur , but his heart was as kind and tender.as that of any dog that ever lived . Joe and Dan were making their way across the little plateau as fast as pos  --  sible . Dan was sure the wolves would not attack them as long as it was good daylight . Joe was not so optimistic , and he said he knew the wolves must be very hungry or they would not be following a bloodstained trail of man during the light Of-the day . Joe was traveling very fast , and Cowow was almost dragging Dan on his tugs . The blood cry rang out again . This ' time the wolves howled a death dirge , and the buys caught sight of them as they came over a low ridge that arose from the breast of the empty plains . They seemed  --  to be coming in a long string , their heads hanging low as their noses pressed close to the bloody trail . The sight of the wolves took all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He seemed to get so weak he could hardly stand . The fast pace they had been traveling , with the heavy loss of blood , was more then he could stand , and he nearly sank to the snow . Noting his condition , Joe immedi  --  ately halted and said , " Here is where we make our stand . I have a new thought . Hurry and let us try it ! " They soon kicked the snow out of a little spot so they could stand on the frozen ground . Then they stuck their snowshoes on end in the snow , like pickets in a fence , on each side of them . They stood with their backs together and their long walking sticks in their hands . They tramped up and down on the frozen ground to keep themselves warm while they waited for the fero  --  cious beasts . Paying Toil to the Pack The racing wolf pack ran up within two hundred yards of them . They halted instantly and retreated about another hundred yards before stop  --  ping . Then some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and others stood up while they watched the two Eskimos . After some minutes had passed , the boys decided the wolves wire not . going to make an immediate attack . The short rest had seemed to put new strength in Dan ; so they started again on their joueney . The wolves followed them but kept about three hundred yards in the rear . Dun and Joe made the timbered canyon about two hours before night , and here , without the aid of an ax , they put up a small wind shelter for the night , which also acted as a heat reflector . They prepared this so the fire would be on the windward side and the heat and smoke would pass over them . While cutting boughs to floor their little shelter , they found a porcupine , which made them and the dog a fair meal . As darkness settled down , the wolves came up about their camp , so February M , %91a close in the boys could see their eyes shin- ing n the dark from the reflected light of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growling and jump  --  ing about at each little creak or  --  snap that sounded in the forest . Joe had gathered enough wood to keep a good fire all night , but so intense was the cold that while one side of their bodies was almost roasting the other was nearly freezing . A few hours before the break of day , while the boys were both asleep , the wolves came up so close to their bed that Cowan ' , with a roaring growl , dashed out into the timber after them , never to return , for the wolves seized him and tore him to pieces . The boys could not sleep after the loss of the dog . When daylight came the wolves were not to be seen . About two hours after dawn the boys were on their way with  --  out any breakfast . After traveling about an hour , they noticed their bloodthirsty hunters following them again , but the wolves did not howl now , and the boys felt safe so lung as they stayed at their distance of three hundred yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dart began to suffer with a very severe headache ; his leg was hurting him and he was evi  --  dently near a collapse . They finally came to the glacier pit , where Joe made the little snow house in which Dan was rolling and tumbling when we found them . We selected the bunk closest to the stove for the boys , and gathered tip all the old rags from the other hunks and made them a mattress . We gave them the canvas tarp and the double wool blanket from our sleeping robe ; this made them a fairly good bed , and all or us rested fairly well until two A. M. , when Dan 's fever ruse again . We had to work with him until daylight before he was easy . We put in the following four days taking care of Dan and hunting porcu  --  pines , rabbits and ptarmigan . In the hitter colder the Nortlr , four people and five dogs require an astonishing amount . of food .

Mrs. Ruggles insisted on their taking a gun with them ; so , as the guns we had found in the cabin were rusted beyond use , we gave them our little .22 pistol and one hundred rounds of cartridges . We let them have the tarp and blanket and an ample supply of food . Joe told us he thought we had been guided to them by God , and he knew no words that would express his thanks for our kindness . Dan cried when he bade us good-by , and said in his broken English that so long as he lived he would credit us with whatever years were left to him , for we had saved his life . They were the only persons we had seen in many months , and we felt so sad and lonesome when we parted from them that we scarcely spoke one word to each other for two or three hours while we traveled on our way back home .
