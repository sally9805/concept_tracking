THE heaviest January rains in history had fallen on the watershed of the Miami River . A hotel bellboy drove up from Dayton for a look at the ordinarily dry Englewood flood basin , and stared at a lake that looked fifteen miles long . " If it was n't for the dam , " he gasped in awe , " that 'd all be in Main Street ! I 'd be swimming ! " Several days later , a stranger hailed a policeman at Dayton 's Main and Fifth streets . Was there , " he asked , " any water along here in 1913 ? " " See those lights up there ? " the policeman said , shaking his stick at street lights twice a tall man 's height . " The water was up to them . If it was n't for our dams , there 'd have been eleven feet of water along here this time . " Dayton 's dams ! Visitors found those dams foremost in the minds of residents of the Miami Valley during this year 's record Ohio Valley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dayton , tens of thousands of people shivered in darkness and fear . Two-thirds of Louisville was driven out of house and home . The same rains fell in the Miami Valley . But in Miami Valley cities there was not a drop of flood water out of channel . The thankfulness of these people was that of sufferers who knew at first hand what it 's all about , who were confident it never could happen to them again . In excess of thankfulness , they exaggerated . There would not have been eleven feet of water in Dayton 's Main Street this year , even though the rainfall did exceed all January records . But without the dams and other waterway improvements , there would have been a flood . That there was none was due to Dayton 's own flood horror twenty-four years ago , and what happened afterward . A fine story , that . One that America should not forget , especially not now . Dayton , Experience Wise , Warns Against Haste M ANY have been saying of the Ohio Valley flood , " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sentiment . Indeed it must not happen again  --  if man can prevent it . Well , then , it is urged , let 's get busy right away . Do not wait till memory of the mud and slime , disease , horror , death , has faded and the urge for action has grown feeble . Let dirt fly now ! These are worthy sentiments . And yet triumphant Dayton herself , having reason to know much about such things , is first to say , " Beware of haste . " It is well to reconsider the Miami Valley . To refresh memories . To recall what was done , and how . Not only for suggestions as to what might be done in the valley of the Ohio but also , and perhaps more importantly , for what might better not be done or even attempted in that great , and greatly troubled valley . From the time of the white man 's coming , waters of the Miami and of its tributaries have been important , for good or for evil , to dwellers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ historian who found time , fifty-odd years ago , to compile a volume of 1220 closely printed pages about Dayton and its environs , tells of an Indian-killing expedition under the leadership of Col. George Rogers Clark in 1782 . Clark forded the Mad River near its mouth and marked the spot as an excellent site for settlement . Thus was Dayton thought of . Another decade had to pass before anything was done . But the site was picked . The mouth of the Mad  --  of the Stillwater , too  --  lies today within the city limits of Dayton . " Settlers , " writes the historian , " were induced to locate on the river bank . . . from their idea that the most desirable property would be near the landing , from whence in future years must be shipped the surplus products of the country . " So , in the winter of 1709 , David Lowry hewed oak planks in the forests above the settlement , fastened them with wooden pins to a frame of oak logs , built the first flatboat . Spring freshets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pelts and five hundred venison hams headed for far waters . Two months later , her cargo and timbers sold , the builder returned overland on horseback . Other adventurers did likewise . Trade spread by the beneficent friendly waters . Three decades after the founding , a canal to Cincinnati was completed , and Dayton really bloomed . But the waters were not always kindly . It was in March , 1805 , before much of the forest cover now considered so important in flood prevention was cut , that the first great flood swept in at the doors of the settlement . " The river is too strong for us , " said certain ones . " We 'll always be in danger here . Let 's move . " It was proposed to rebuild the settlement on higher ground . Two prominent citizens were unwilling to abandon improvements they had made . The plan was dropped . Dayton continued to invite her destiny by the side of the waters . Many a time in years to come , often at night , the cry of " Flood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1814 is remembered for high waters , and 1828 , 1832 , and 1547 ? this year was worse than most , for the new levee broke , relief parties worked all night , on horseback and in boats , rescuing people from dwellings . The historian says : " The levee was shortly afterward strongly reconstructed , and is constantly being strengthened , and since the waterway has been widened by the bridge extensions , it is believed that there can be no danger to the city from high waters in the future . " He wrote in 1882 . Still to come was the icy flood of February , 1883 , of 1886 ; the March floods of 1897 and 1898 , the latter accounted the second-largest , fully recorded flood in the city 's history . After each , " finis " was written in these words : " The levees were strengthened and extended . " And then came 1913 . This is not the place to describe that nightmare . At dawn on Tuesday , March twenty-fifth , high waters had come . Fred Boyer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock in the morning , saw a gaunt Paul Revere galloping down the street . " The levee 's broke ! " cried the horseman . " The levee 's broke ! " The Promises Made in the Attie U P AND DOWN the valley , at Piqua , at Troy , at Hamilton , as at Dayton , the waters took horrible toll . No one knows how many lives were lost . Bodies recovered numbered 361 . Hundreds disappeared and were never found . The property loss in Dayton alone was estimated at 866.765,574 . Suggestive are the records of the clean-up : 1420 dead horses and 2000 other dead animals removed ; 133,600 wagonloads of debris hauled away ; 98 dead bodies recovered ; 12,131 houses , cellars and premises cleaned and disinfected by the sanitary department ; 680,000 Government rations distributed to the stricken . And this was only part of it . For more than a century , then , Dayton and its neighbor cities of the Miami Valley lived under threat of flood . Levees were raised . But the shouting river , when it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Many old-timers in undisturbed Dayton , in January , 1937 , reminded one another of a slogan that was popular during and after 1913 : " Remember the promises made in the attic ! " As they climbed higher and higher in their homes to escape rising waters , many reached the attic . Somechopped through rafters and shingles for light and a last way of escape . Huddling , afraid , hungry , miserable , they muttered : " This wo n't happen again . " in hip boots on an upper floor of the A group Athletic Club , were among the loudest mutterers . It might have been only a mutter , forgotten when the emergency passed , but Dayton at that-time had an unusual number of men of vision , leaders who resolved that these attic-made promises should not be forgotten , that something must be done , that it must be no halfway something . To name names in this connection has never been popular in Dayton . Not individuals , they say , did what was done , but all the people , aroused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Patterson , for example , one-time canal-tollgate keeper , who converted a bad investment into the National Cash Register Company . Adam Schantz , Jr. , Dayton-born son of a German father , brewer and builder . Tames M. ( Jimmy ) Cox , newspaper publisher , state governor , later a presidential nominee . Many more . and far from least , E. A. Deeds , famous with " Boss " Kettering for developing self-starters for automobiles . But credit was not what . the leaders worked for . Once , later , when it was seen that something fine had been done , a few thought that silver spades should be handed around , or names should be carved on tablets . Quietly it was resolved to settle that suggestion once for all by holding a dinner . Holding it where ? Why , in the outlet conduit of one of the flood-protection dams , so that anyone attending might be thoroughly drowned ! With such a spirit , deeds flourished . At one of the first meetings , someone suggested raising a fund . A quarter of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , perhaps , had never made a speech in his whole life , rose . For once , inspired , he was Demosthenes . A quarter of a million , he cried . What good would that do ? Let 82,000,000 be raised . Ile capped oratory by pledging $120,000 himself . Within sixty days , the $2,000,000 fund was a fact : a fund that was not any one man 's fund , nor a gift from Washington or elsewhere . It was Dayton 's self-imposed fund , created for the purpose of solving Dayton 's own problem . Some 23,000 residents , despite heavy flood losses and recent miseries , dug down and paid up . Finding Out What Ought to be Done L1NTHUSIASM and subscriptions do not create r4 flood protection . It may have been hazily in Adam Schantz 's mind that 82.000,000 would be all the money needed to protect . Dayton from further floods . Ideas were nebulous . " I do n't think , ' : said Colonel Deeds , months later , " that anyone on the committee at that time had any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that we probably could get some local protection . " Everybody wanted dirt to fly by fall . What the fund did , in the final event , was to provide ample means for finding out what ought to he done . One of the first acts of the Miami Valley Flood Prevention Association was the hiring of an engineer . There was secret drama even there , and a citizen who wanted no credit . Politics desired to name the engineer . But a certain political boss sensed that something fine for Dayton was in the making . He wanted a piece those attributes which go to make up a public enemy . " None of the men who denounce me has any facts or any responsibility . I can not reply in the same sort of language , for I have responsibilities and , anyway , I have neither the desire nor the ability to go on the soap box . Even if I did , it would not matter . For I am mostly accused of things I never did or even heard of . The way is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would make me a hero . But I would also have to raise selling prices , and that would cut down our sales and turn the high wages and short hours into fake benefices . I do not want to be a fourflusher . I would rather be a public enemy . " This man was trying to say that his corporation had been drawn into the political arena and that he was being expected to run it and at the same time be , in effect , the leader of a little political party . He knew business , but he did not know how to resist political attacks disguised as economic theories . Most of it , but no credit and no cash . He warned the leaders , turned events from what might . have been disaster at the start . The part he played won him a lasting place in the esteem of the few who knew . An engineer then was hired ; one who had specialized in water control . An engineer who later became president of a college to sponsor an unusual educational program @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's TVA  --  Arthur E. Morgan . Mr. Morgan 's assignment was to learn whether anything could he done to protect the Miami Valley from floods . If so , what , and how much . He began by taking nothing for granted . His first instructions confined him to the region north of the south line of Montgomery County  --  Dayton 's county . His first idea was that relief for Dayton could probably be secured by improving the river channel and partty rebuilding some city bridges . But time and study soon proved the unwisdom of this . The entire valley , despite political boundaries that divided it into small entities , was found to be a natural unit as far as flood control was concerned ; no part of it . could be left out of consideration with safety to the remaining parts . Research Lends a Hand Compared with the vast Ohio , the Miami is a midget . The total length of its winding course is 163 miles . Its most important tributary , the Whitewater , empties so near the mouth of the Miami , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miami system . . . . The Miami drainage area above Hamilton is 3672 square miles and above Dayton , 2525 square miles . The slopes are sharp and steep , the grades of the main streams rather flat . Though draining of swamp lands , tiling , cultivation of farms , and , possibly , the destruction of the forests , have slightly increased the flood runoff , the tremendous floods that sweep down the valley are due , primarily , to the great storms which occur at intervals in this section of the United States . This description is official . politicians are lawyers , and in order to meet them in public forums , there is a decided drift toward lawyers as corporate heads . A little while ago  --  say in 1929 ? all bankers and corporate heads were wonder men  --  and many of them gracefully acknowledged that they were . Now the pendulum has swung . But the men of 1937 are much the same sort of men who performed in 1929 . May it not be that the human deflating of recent years is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? The quality of business and banking executives can be improved . So can the quality of all the human beings who go to make up our nation . But can the improvements be brought about by law ? The quality of Government service scarcely makes a case for governmental supervision of the ability of corporate executives . Might it not be more to the point to develop standards of ethics ? Few men cheat at cards . But that is not because of the law . There is no law against cheating at cards . Before there was hope of controlling these " tremendous floods , " extensive studies had to be undertaken . There was the seemingly simple question of storm rainfall . How much , conceivably , could fall on the Miami watershed ? In how short a time ? And if the maximum amount fell in the shortest time , under conditions making for fastest runoff , how big a flood would ensue ? Every known authentic meteorological source at home and abroad was examined , including the 900-year flood records on the Danube at Vienna , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached was that a condition 20 per cent worse than that of 1913 , was the most severe that conceivably could occur , But in order to be quite safe , it was decided to add another 20 per cent . The Hydraulic Jump There was also the question of how much water a stream channel can carry . There had been guesses , approximations , but nobody exactly knew . It had to be known , with similar exactitude , what stream flow does to the banks of rivers at bends , under varying conditions of volume , velocity and soil type . Then , as a plan for the Miami began to emerge , and because of local topography , the idea of dams and retarding basins became more obvious as a solution , it was necessary to study the flow of water through outlet conduits . When waters pile up behind a dam and their only outlet is located at the bottom of the dam , they can push through that outlet with tremendous velocity . It was imperative to study , as the question never before had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on a natural stream bed ; and to invent an entirely new means of dissipating the force of the water . Many methods were tried . Experiments lasted for months . The principle finally employed was the hydraulic jump , a peculiar effect occurring when water at high velocity strikes a mass of water virtually still . A sound method of employing this effect in outlet conduits was perfected for the first time by engineers of the Miami Conservancy District . Arthur Morgan also felt that it was necessary to consider every plan proposed , even the crackpot plans , that might have any possible flood-control merit . Weird and wonderful schemes were advanced . One gentleman desired to construct a series of paddle wheels across the river above Dayton , to paddle high waters back upstream . Another desired to sink wells in the river bed , and open traps to drop flood waters in . Seriously considered were proposals for diverting the Mad River over the hills into the Little Miami ; for diverting the Miami around the cities . The plan finally recommended and adopted was simple , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two main features : First , a series of five dams to create huge flood basins ; second , scientific channel improvement in the cities . Ever  --  Norrnat Water Flow The channels were studied , to determine how much widening and deepening was feasible from a practical cost standpoint , in view of vested interests on the banks . When this was known , and the engineers knew how much water these channels could handle , it was then possible to figure how much basin storage would be needed . Flood  --  retarding or detention  --  basins were a new idea in this country . Nowhere in the world had anyone built such huge basins , and as many basins , as were contemplated for the Miami . Storage dams , of course , have been built since man first messed with mud pies . But these were not designed as storage dams . Their purpose was utterly different . To borrow a compound adjective from the Secretary of Agriculture , they were designed to create something like an ever-normal flow of water in the river channels below . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ run off entirely unchecked , up to a certain point . Beyond a maximum calculated rate , the water could not flow . Why ? Because the retarding dams were there to stop it . In the event that rain ever should fall in such vast quantities as to out-top all calculations and fill the dams top-full , concrete spillways were provided seventeen feet below the tops of the dams , to prevent ruining the earthen top . But the dams were planned so big , their storage capacity is so great , that it was and is believed that these spillways may never be used for the purpose intended . The system was designed to be purely automatic . Alter construction , human judgment was never to enter into operation of the plan . The outlet conduits were planned large enough to release only the maximum flow that could be put safely into the channels through the cities . In ordinary times they carry off the entire stream flow . There is , therefore , no permanent flooding of great areas . Land behind the dams was planned to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come mostly in January , February or March , and the danger period is from November to May . Farm lands behind the dams , it was thought , could be used for all summer crops , and should benefit by silt deposits . As for cities , the plan provided for comprehensive replanning and rebuilding of levees . Channels were to be deepened and widened where necessary . In some places , in order to maintain a desirable even rate of flow , they were to be narrowed . The plan did not aim to give eom-piete protection from flooding to farm lands below dams . To have done that would have raised costs prohibitively . It did promise , however , to make the flooding of farms far less disastrous , to limit flood erosion and the depositing of gravel beds on fertile fields . Briefly , that was the plan . The engineers had spoken . There remained the politicians , farmers , industries , individuals and interests affected , with all their fears , hesitations , doubts . To handle flood protection for the valley as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lines ; luckily , the watershed was wholly within one state . But to cross these political boundaries and do all that was necessary , a new kind of law was required . One weM 4 written  --  by experts . John A. MeM n , whom Uncle Joe Cannon once ed " the ablest lawyer I ever knew in either house of Congress , " attended to making it stand solidly on its costitutional and legal legs ; and Arthlk Morgan attended to ineorporatieg provisions he needed in order to go ahead and move dirt . McMahon personally presented the law , when drafted , to Governor Cox . The governor read it , saw how sectional jealousies would he stirred , thought it would be hard to get it through the legislature . " I know it 's going to be bard , " twinkled McMahon . " But I also know who is governor of Ohio . " A smart . man knows when and whom to flatter . There was a bitter fight . " Don't. worry ! " said Governor Cox to Colonel Deeds toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I will worry ! " said Col to Governor Cox ; " I 've be races , but this is the first had a horse in one . " The Pros and Cons at War The law was passed . Governor Cox signed it on February 17 , 1914 . Eventually it withstood every court test , became a model for other states . Briefly , the Conservancy Act , as it was called , enabled counties to co-operate for purposes of preventing floods  --  regulating stream channels and flow , diverting or eliminating water courses , building reservoirs , dams , levees , bridges , and so on  --  levying assessments or taxes for construction and maintenance . Authority was vested in a court consisting of a common-pleas judge from each county concerned ; and the court , in turn , was authorized to name directors who would run the job . The day after the bill was signed , a petition was filed in the Court of Common Pleas of Montgomery County , asking for the establishment of the Miami Conservancy District . This started another cat-and-dog fight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep the law on the books as written , and to do the job as it was known it should be done . A fight , on the other hand , to obstruct and prevent its fulfillment . It was not until June 28 , 1915 , that the Miami Conservancy District was established , and even then construction was far off . During a single week in 1916 , the record shows , a mass meeting was held at Tippecanoe City in opposition ; the Piqua City Council adopted a resolution objecting to the plans ; the Miami County commissioners adopted resolutions objecting ; the Shelby County commissioners filed objections . Inflammatory editors said to excitable readers ; " Dayton is willing to ruin more than one farm in her eagerness to help THE SRTURDAY herself . " " No jury could be secured in Miami County to convict a man of blowing up the dam . " ? ? . Many sincerely feared that earthen dams , as proposed , were not safe . People envisioned waters piling up behind them , becoming irresistible , breaking through , wreaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was due to lack of understanding of the hydraulic-fill method of building earth dams ; and with the greatest patience it was explained , time after time , to all who would listen , that this system , borrowed and adapted from placer-mining operations , created a center core of impervious material , that the resulting dam is less a dam than a hill , that it is as little likely to move as the ancient hills created by Nature herself . Colonel Deeds in court  --  he was the first and to this day the only chairman of the Miami Conserva uey District 's board of direetors  --  was quizzed by a judge : Are you satisfied that these dams are all right ? " Earnestly , the colonel replied : " I am so well satisfied that I would he willing to build my house belcw. one of them , move in my family , live then till I die . " Some of the opposition , -f course , centered around private-prope ty interests . Behind the dams were large areas subject to flooding whenever the waters rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should be floode 1 in order to save the rest of the vs ' The chief owners were farmers . Tien . vere also railroad right of ways , wire ' lines highways , one entire village of more than 1000 people . As far as farm lands behind the dams were concerned , it was necessary , for the most part , to buy them outright . A large part of the land , however , was later resold to farmers , the district retaining a flood easement . Only twice have growing crops suffered serious damage . For the rest , the land becomes richer from the annual deposit of fine silt . These silt deposits are not very heavy , however , and the engineers are led to conclude that erosion  --  at least for this area and soil type  --  is not so serious a flood consequence as is sometimes stated . There is no sign whatever of reduced reservoir capacity because of silting . No buildings of any kind are allowed in the basins below certain established limits . A Tax That is Popular Railroads were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The town of Osborn , which lay squarely in the basin behind the Huffman Dam , was bought , lock , stork , barrel . Oshornites later bought 129.48 acres two miles away , above flood line , hired a landscape gardener , purchased many of the homes they had sold to the district , had them rolled uphill to the new site . There was not only a. forecast of damage but also a prospect of enormous benefits . A property subject to recurrent flood damage would obviously have one value ; the same property completely protected from flood would have a far different value . A huge and necessary job , therefore , was the appraisal of benefits . It was done with infinite attention to detail , with the almost impossible purpose of being completely fair to everyone . Thus , a building that was flooded in 1913 to a depth of ten feet was considered to be benefited by protection more than a building of the same kind flooded only to a depth of five feet . When all figures were in , total direct benefits wore @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appraisal , assessments were levied . The estimated cost of the project amounted to about 36 per cent of the appraised benefits . About half of the cost was levied against properties directly benefited . The balance was assessed as a general levy against counties and townships in the district . I was told by more than one person in the Miami Valley that this assessment is one tax that is popular  --  that is , taxpayers see what they are getting and are glad to pay . It had been hoped , after 1913 , that dirt would fly by fall . Actually , the first construction in connection with the dams was not begun until November 15 , 1917 , when nearly everybody had forgotten the flood because of the war . The work involved the building i of Ave dams ranging in height urn 73 to 125 feet , and in length fr ' 1200 to 6400 feet ; improving miles levees and channels in nine villages and towns ; relocating about fifty-five miles of railroad and many miles of highwa and wire lines ; eliminating one villagrfA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tasks . It was finished in 1923 . The Comm. unity That Conquered It took Dayton and the Miami Valley ten years , then , to get complete flood protection , after deciding to get it . More than half of that time was consumed in making plans and meeting opposition . The flood-control engineering in the Miami Valley was , by all counts , brilliaptLy done . But perhaps even more brillian tas the human engineeringthat overran ' . obstacles legal , financial , political fl-sonal . Without this second kind of sneering , the first could not have prIr vied at all . " The intrinsic merit o. great project , " wrote one Miami gineer sadly , " is not in itself sufficietzt to assure the success of that project . " And Chief Engineer Morgan in one report declared : " The most significant aspect of this undertaking can not be covered in any technical report . For it was the spirit of the community , no less than careful planning , which made possible the final success . " The Miami Valley 's flood-protection system has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1913 . Such a test may not come for generations . It may come next year . It has , however , met perfectly every test that it has had . Water has been stored in the retarding basins for varying periods on many occasions . From 1922 to 1931 there were seven major storms which would have caused floods under the old conditions . The system 's greatest test was in January of this year . The Ohio Valley floods of 1037 have been called the worst in history . In the Miami Valley , as we have seen , more rain fell in January than in any other known January . But the rains were pretty well distributed , making runoff conditions quite different from those of 1913 . In that year , the intensity of the flood was due to the fact that approximately nine inches of rain fell on the watershed in three and one-half days . About the same amount of rain fell in January , this year , during the critical period ; but that period was twelve days , January thirteenth to twenty-fourth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but between times , the river fell . At no time were the storage basins required to store water to anything like capacity . The Germantown Dam , for example , has a storage capacity to the spillway crest of 106,000 acre-feet ; March 27 , 0937 at the maximum in January it stored only about 20,000 acre-feet , approximately 18.8 per cent of capacity . Total possible storage behind all five dams is 841,000 acre-feet ; the maximum actually stored in January at any one time was approximately 100,000 acre-feet . This year 's extraordinary rainfall , therefore , was really not a test . Is the story of the Miami Valley significant today for other river valleys threatened periodically by flood disasters ? There is a growing feeling that Dayton is a model , that others would be well off if they did as Dayton has done . I asked Colonel Deeds about that . Here 's what he said : " If others mean to copy the things this valley did , they 'll probably get nowhere . I do n't believe anybody knows , yet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or even whether the valley can be protected . It may take years to find out , and many more years to get protection after a plan is devised . If our experience means anything , it means this : Dirt should not fly too soon . Give competent engineers time to study the problem comprehensively , completely , conclusively . The impression has gone out that complete plans are already lying in the files ; that if some wizard will give the word , work could start in a month . Maybe that 's so , but I seriously doubt it . It would be the worst kind of tragedy if hundreds of millions of dollars were spent too soon , and millions of people down river were led to believe in a protection that they did not have . " If it is meant , however , to copy the spirit in which the people of the Miami Valley tackled their problem , probably it can be licked . Not tomorrow . Not in a year or two . But eventually . " " We Did it Ourselves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did the job ourselves , to save our own lives and property ; and when it was done , we dug down and paid the entire cost ourselves  --  we who were benefited . The total cost , including bond interest , will be around $67,000,000 . It is more than 60 per cent paid for , will be completely so by 1949 . Meanwhile we have been repaid manifold not only through lives and property saved but also through peace of mind enjoyed . " Another significant thing is that we never compromised . Our plan was checked and rechecked by the most competent experts ; in final form it was like a fine watch  --  leave out a tiny cogwheel and it would n't work . We did n't chisel at it , nor did we allow others to . " We put the undertaking on a sort of holy-war basis , and few intelligent citizens cared to align themselves heedlessly against it . The tremendous opposition could be met , was met , by the solid wall of facts aligned in favor of the plan . Secondary purposes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the one thing we never lost sight of . " On a plain tablet over the outlet conduit of one of the dams , I read , early in February , not the names of self-satisfied builders of the Miami Conservancy District , but this , their homely , pertinent. , permanent reminder : TILE DAMS OF TIM MIAMI CONSERVANCY DISTRICT ARE FOR FLOOD-PREVENTION PURPOSES . THEIR USE FOR POWER DEVELOPMENT OR FOR STORAC1E WORLD DE A MENACE TO CITIES BELOW . As rivers go , the Miami is just a little fellow . But the Miami Valley spirit ought to work wonders anywhere in the fight against floods.
