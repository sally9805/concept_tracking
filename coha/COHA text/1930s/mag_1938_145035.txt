The day is now one-thousandth of a second longer than it was a century ago . Although this change has had no effect on clocks , it is highly significant for astronomers . Just before he died last July , venerable , 71-year-old Professor Ernest William Brown of Yale , who spent half a century studying the passage of time , sent the Smithsonian Institution an original hypothesis on the lengthening of the day . <P> Last week it appeared in the Institution 's annual report . <P> According to mathematicians , the length of the day is determined by the speed of the earth 's rotation on its axis . Slower speed means a longer day . According to astronomers , speed of the earth 's rotation on its axis is affected by the moon . Reason : the moon pulls the tides , and a strong pull creates friction on the earth 's surface , slows down its motion . This well-known fact , said Professor Brown , accounts for slight variations in the day 's length , but the moon 's influence is not powerful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which occurred in 1897 , when the apparent length of the year was changed by one second . Practical reason for studying the phenomenon , he added , is that the length of the day is more variable now than ever and a new change may soon occur . <P> According to astronomical theory no force external to the earth can produce large changes in its rotation on its axis . As for surface changes on the earth . Dr. Brown rules them out . Older theories held that accumulations of ice and snow at the poles might slow up the earth 's speed . But the least amount of frozen water necessary to slow up the earth would have changed the average sea level all over the world by about a foot . This has not happened . The weight of mountains and force of volcanoes are also inconsiderable . Even if the whole group of Himalayas could be razed and piled up at the pole , the earth 's speed would not be altered . <P> Thus ' ' driven to changes below the surface , " Dr. Brown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulsate bodily , and it is not unreasonable to suspect that the earth , a star , pulsates too . If there is a uniform contraction and expansion of the entire globe a raising of five inches in the crust is sufficient to slow down the earth and account for the maximum lengthening of the day which has so far been observed . The process of expansion , said Dr. Brown , might conceivably take place if there were a layer of material near the earth 's surface which was at a critical temperature ( one in which a small change of temperature produces a relatively large change of volume ) . Thus a slight change in the temperature of the earth 's interior would produce a considerable alteration of the crust . How the earth contracts and expands Dr. Brown could only speculate . Evidence for his theory lies in the fact that the fissures all over the earth ( such as occur in mountain building ) constantly repeat their openings and closings . Last advice of Astronomer Brown was the suggestion that sensitive instruments be set up near large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measurements might then lead to some predictions .
