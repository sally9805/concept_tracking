Last winter , after twelve barren years , frail Mrs. Howard Albert Jackson of Manhattan bore her proud husband a baby girl . For two months the joyous Jacksons showed off little Alice to their admiring friends . Then suddenly they noticed that her head was swelling like a little balloon . The tender fontanel at the top of her head was tense and bulging , and thick blue veins stood out like cords underneath her downy hair . The doctor shook his head , told them that the baby had hydrocephalus ( water on the brain ) and , like 2,000 other hydrocephalic children born in the U. S. every year , was probably doomed to imbecility or death . Water pressure from the interior of her brain , he said , would squeeze the baby 's grey matter against her soft skull bones until her head became even larger than the head of a normal adult . <P> Determined to keep their hard-won baby , the Jacksons frantically combed Manhattan every day for a month , seeking a doctor who would offer them some hope . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ John Edwin Scarff . By this time the head of little eleven-pound Alice measured 18 inches in circumference . Dr. Scarff agreed to operate . <P> Ventriculoscope . Buried in the middle of the brain are four ventricles or water reservoirs , the two largest shaped like a pair of ram 's horns . Each ventricle is partly lined with feathery tissue called the choroid plexus . Function of the choroid plexus is to generate the fluid which bathes the outside of the brain and spinal cord . If the choroid plexus produces abnormal quantities of water , or if the brain fails to absorb the fluid which bathes it , hydrocephalus occurs . <P> Purpose of Dr. Scarff 's operation on Alice was to destroy the choroid plexus in her first two ventricles , thus diminishing the water supply to her brain . ( The third and fourth ventricles are smaller , produce minute quantities of water . ) First he made a one-inch slit on the top of her scalp , cut out a small plug of bone . Into the tiny hole he inserted his ventriculoscope . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an inch in diameter , ten inches long . At the bottom is a lens , two tiny electric lights , two threadlike rubber hoses , for maintaining adequate fluid pressure in the brain , and an electric wire for cauterizing . At the top of the instrument is an eye piece and an electric connection . Gently working the ventriculoscope through Alice 's grey matter down to one of her ventricles , Dr. Scarff was able to see about two inches of choroid plexus . Turning on the electricity , he seared off all the feathery tissue he could reach with his hot wire . Within a half hour he had cauterized the choroid plexus in both ventricles . After the operation , he gently withdrew the tube , inserted the plug of bone , neatly stitched up the baby 's scalp . <P> Intelligence . Three days after her operation , little Alice was sucking lustily at her bottle . Her fontanel began to sink . Last week , when Dr. Scarff gave Alice a checkup , he found that her head had decreased a quarter of an inch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ size . She gurgled , tried to sit up alone and reach for his finger . " We 're simply crazy about her now , " cried beaming Mr. Jackson .
