coordinated " quickly when the time is ripe . To expose and break and keep broken the threads of a web which is as yet weak but definitely fascist in pattern is one of the important functions of democratic government . Government agencies might well turn their attention from the deportation of refugees from European fascism to the clipping of fascist wings at home . THE DEATH OF SENATOR COUZENS OF Michigan , just after his defeat for reelection , ends the career of one of the most courageous , useful , and honest members of the Senate . The amazing romance of his career ? a fortune of $30,000,000 acquired as a result of his investment of $1,000 in Henry Ford 's car and his subsequent organization and brilliant management of the Ford Motor Company -- never threw him off his balance or gave him an inflated idea of his own importance . He refused to be bound by narrow party ties . Indeed , he told the electors last summer that the reelection of President Roosevelt was the most important matter confronting the nation , and that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neither important to the nation nor me . " His long experience in the affairs of a large corporation made it possible for him to meet on equal terms the business men who appeared before Congress , notably when he was chairman of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce . They could pull no wool over his eyes , nor baffle him by any intricate points they raised . The Michigan Democrats who backed him last spring characterized him as " one who can not understand the fight of the Republican Party for the almighty dollar and its disregard for human rights . " A great fighter , Senator Couzens never hesitated to oppose rich men and the big business interests . He will be remembered for the fight he waged against Secretary Mellon and the tax favors which he charged Mr. Mellon with granting to the big corporations . Throughout his term of office he fought for increasing the income-tax rates in the higher income groups . Without being a progressive himself , he was often of the greatest value to the progressive bloc in Congress . THE ARREST OF @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a general tightening by democratic governments in the treatment of fascist violence . Franco , Mosley , Degrelle , Doriot are the present luminaries in the fascist heaven . Spurred by Hitler 's success , they are adopting new tactics . They are all loud-mouthed men , but lung power has not been enough . For years Mosley , for example , has ranted to little effect . But now , responsive to the advice of Goebbels , he has carried his message and his thugs into the Jewish-populated East End of London , where his provocations can lead only to riots and pogroms . Sir John Simon , the British Home Secretary , evidently means to follow a hands-off policy , which is exactly what the fascists are counting on . But the immense protest from every source shows that the English people have a more realistic view . Roughly it runs as follows : Let the fascists talk so long as it is only talk . But let there be no uniforms permitted as badges of a private army . And as soon as a speech or a demonstration @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ riot and violence , let the law come down with all its force . This is the method that is now being used with success in Norway , Sweden , and Denmark . It is a method and a problem that Americans may have to face in the not distant future . WHILE THE UNITED STATES CONCERNS ITSELF with the outpourings of political aspirants and their supporters , in person , in the press , on the air , all irresponsibly charging fascism and communism and the betrayal of democracy , the reality behind these tags dominates the diplomatic war that all Europe is engaged in as well as the desperate physical war in Spain . In this week 's Nation Europe 's realities are drawn into focus in three articles that taken together form a picture of progress toward chaos . Louis Fischer , from the dangerous vantage-point of Madrid , describes the eager hope of Soviet help that lifts the hearts of the desperate defenders of Spain 's  --  and perhaps Europe 's  --  democracy . Meanwhile , Russian efforts are checkmated at London , and French sympathies are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which Robert Dell on another page exposes as a helpless appendage to the British Foreign Office . In England labor 's efforts in behalf of European democracy are similarly diluted . Harold Laski analyzes the fateful divisions and the naive credulity which combine to emasculate the attempts of British labor to direct or modify the government 's policy . When the pieces are put together , the resulting picture of Europe is about as somber as a landscape could be . DESPITE BLUM 'S NON-INTERVENTION FIASCO , the French Popular Front government enters on its second six months with moderately favorable prospects . The Radical Socialist Congress at Biarritz voted unanimously to support Blum on condition that the stay-in strikes be suppressed and the budget balanced . While neither of these objectives will be easy to attain , Blum has promised that his budget will be " sound " and not create a huge deficit . On the left , the Communists are dissatisfied both with the government 's policy of neutrality in the Spanish conflict and with the recent prohibition of Communist meetings , but have indicated no intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factors should work increasingly in the government 's favor . Devaluation not only promises to stimulate general business activity but has made possible the belated introduction of the forty-hour week and other reforms which were voted last June . The government 's greatest strength . however , lies not so much in anything it has accomplished as in the certainty that its downfall would bring chaos in France . Armed with this weapon Blum could , if he chose , make a real beginning toward introducing the Socialist commonwealth to which he professes allegiance . THE SUSPICION THAT GOVERNOR LANDON has a very inadequate conception of foreign affairs was fully confirmed in his Indianapolis speech , the first that he has given on the vital issues that will preoccupy the President during the next four years . That he should be against the League and World Court is not surprising , considering that he is a protege of Hearst 's . Instead of collective security , he assures us that we may rely on goodwill , mediation , arbitration , and preparedness to pull us through the next four years and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a war-ridden world . However , lest he be mistaken for a pacifist , he opposes any specific pledge not to go to war , and utters a tacit warning against any country violating our neutral rights as Germany did in 1917 . As a final touch of irony Mr. Landon , who has been touring the country denouncing the Hull reciprocal agreements , pleads for a " lowering of trade barriers and the reestablishment of healthy economic conditions . " As against the contention that peace and recovery can only be assured if the United States is willing to modify its imperialistic aims , Mr. Landon merely denies that we have any such interests . THE MAN ON THE STREET CAN NOT AFFORD to buy paintings . Ordinarily he can not even buy prints at from $20 up . We have already commented on the admirable work being done by the WPA art projects in creating an art by and for the many . The problem has now been approached by the artists themselves from the side of distribution . The American Artists Group has lately announced the sale of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ $2.75 each . The prints are unsigned and the number printed from one plate is unlimited . An attempt to popularize painting is being made by Living American Art , Incorporated , which four times a year will offer exhibitions of twelve paintings reproduced by the collotype process , almost indistinguishable , it is said , from the original . Some 250 exhibitions of the first twelve reproductions are being shown simultaneously in various American cities . Among the artists in the two groups are Jean Chariot , Asa Cheffetz , Howard Cook , Adolf Dehn , Mabel Dwight , Wanda Gag , William Gropper , Yasuo Kunioyoshi , John Sloan , Louis Bouche , Peggy Bacon , George Grosz , and Reginald Marsh . The collotype reproductions are for sale at $5 each and are available to libraries and schools as loan exhibits . The artists will receive royalties on the sale of these pictures . This is an encouraging sign that the fences in the art market which have kept artists isolated from their larger public and therefore impoverished are being broken down . There will soon be no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even in modest households , as good books . IN GREAT BRITAIN THIS MONTH COMPANIES of men are marching along many roads converging on London . They are the unemployed from the distressed and derelict areas , where driblets of relief have kept them hanging by their fingernails to the subsistence level , where they have gone without work and suffered the rigors of the means test long enough . Now they are carrying their case direct to the government at Westminster . The Jarrow marchers from the north of England , whom Mr. Laski mentions on another page , started 200 strong on October 5 , after attending special services in the church and being blessed by the bishop . They were accompanied on the first ten miles of their way by the mayor and the alderman and on the whole journey by Miss Ellen Wilkinson , Jarrow 's M.P . At the same time 400 are marching from Scotland and 500 from South Wales , welcomed along their way by town officials with offers of food and lodging . The ineptitude of the government in handling relief has just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Special Areas , who could no longer put up with the entirely inadequate measures he was allowed to take . Yet the first thing the Cabinet did on Baldwin 's return was to declare that the marches were " altogether undesirable " and could have no " constitutional influence on policy , " and that the Ministers would receive no deputations . While the Cabinet was thus drawing aside its skirts , the King announced his intention of making a personal tour of inspection of the distressed areas in South Wales . What can be said of a government that takes even less responsibility than its supposed " figurehead " ? THE VANGUARD PRESS " HAS THE HONOR TO announce " the publication of James T. Farrell 's new novel , " A World I Never Made . " But not in the New York Times . According to a statement issued by the publishers on October 23 , the Times has refused to advertise Mr. Farrell 's book because the novel is " too frank . " The issue is not one of censorship . An advertisement may be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in the present case , with the adequacy of the Trmes 's reasons . As its own reviewer pointed out on the same day the publishers ' announcement was made , the book " is a broad human scene , peopled by characters unmistakably human and deplorably true to life . " It is the case of " Ulysses " over again , a book which was certainly " frank " but not  --  and the highest courts finally so declared  --  in any sense of the word salacious . Mr. Farrell 's high seriousness has never been questioned . More than that , he is an author whose performance has equaled his intent . His " Studs Lonigan " trilogy can stand comparison with Dreiser 's best work . And to make the parallel complete , - one need only recall that " Sister Carrie , " which has been duly advertised more than once in our best journals , was refused publication for many years because it was thought to be improper and degrading . What the Times is said to object to is Mr. Farrell 's " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ streets ; his small boy talks and thinks in the words that a small boy knows . But the offense , if there is any , lies not in the words themselves but in the poverty and ignorance out of which they rise . When our censors of bad language protest against these also , we shall be able to accept their censorship of words with better grace .
