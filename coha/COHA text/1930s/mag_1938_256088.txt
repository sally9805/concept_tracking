Between a teacher and a politician , declared Oklahoma 's Senator Josh Lee in addressing a teachers ' conference at Albany , N. Y. last week , there is this difference : A teacher makes his bed and lies in it ; a politician makes his bunk and lies out of it . <P> &gt; High in the esteem of Janizary Thomas ( " Tommy the Cork " ) Corcoran as a candidate for the vacancy on the U. S. Supreme Court is Governor Frank Murphy of Michigan , who is having a tough battle for reelection . Observers were not surprised to read last week in " Washington Daily Merry-Go-Round , " the political column by Drew Pearson* &; Robert S. Allen which is one of Janizary Corcoran 's favorite wind tunnels for testing political balloons , a handsome tribute to Mr. Murphy and a serious discussion of his qualifications to succeed the late Justice Cardozo . Excerpts : " When Murphy was judge of the recorder 's court he kept a little cardboard placard behind his desk where only he could see it . It read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of leniency . . . . <P> " Murphy also called every convict into chambers and privately told him in advance what his sentence would be and why . <P> He hated to see a man stand in open court and get the sudden shock of a sentence without advance preparation . <P> " Governor Murphy is a devout Catholic , attends Mass regularly . Even his critics give him credit for broad tolerance . <P> " He abhors bloodshed . Another characteristic is his fighting sympathy for the underdog . He is frankly , definitely , enthusiastically prolabor , believes that relations between capital and labor constitute the nation 's most difficult problem . " <P> &gt;In Chicago , the Bill Posters &; Billers Union ( A. F. of L. affiliate ) last week refused to handle Republican campaign material . <P> *In reporting one reason why Columnist Pearson dislikes Maryland 's Senator Tydings ( TIME , Oct. 24 ) , TIME erred in stating that Mr. Pearson once courted the present Mrs. Tydings.                 @ @ @ @
