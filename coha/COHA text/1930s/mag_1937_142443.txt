JORDANSTOWN - Josephine Johnson - Simon &; Schuster ( $2 ) . <P> Josephine Johnson 's first novel , Now in November , took the 1935 Pulitzer Prize on points , for sheer beauty . Last week she went at the hurdle of her second novel- which for authors is what Becher 's Brook is for Grand National riders . Interested bystanders shook their heads over a near-cropper , gave odds that she would not finish in the money , and those who attach more value to performance than style said Author Johnson 's Pegasus got his feet all mixed up in metaphors , looked better in a show ring than he did over a fence . <P> Allen was a young rebel . He wanted to shatter conservative midwestern Jordanstown to bits , fit the pieces to a humaner pattern . So did his pal Dave . When Allen scraped together enough money to buy the local paper he proceeded to set the town on its ear . Subscriptions fell off but needy friends rallied to Allen 's cause . Jordanstown 's bosses dropped Allen a hint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Climax of his crusade was a parade of the underdogs , led by Dave and Allen , to the new meeting house built by painful comradely effort . When the cheering marchers got there , the chief of police and a committee of plug-uglies were waiting for them . In the riot Dave was shot , Allen clubbed . Then the meeting house was burned down . When Allen got out of jail he found his paper had been wrecked . Most of his intimidated followers left him . Dave died of his wound . Allen somehow got his paper started again , closed the ranks , marched on . <P> None but Jordanstowners would deplore Author Johnson 's humane sentiments , but many from other counties will squirm at the humorless rhetoric she dresses them up in . Unreconstructed oldsters who remembered Booth ( " Old Tark " ) Tarkington 's The Conquest of Canaan averred that they still preferred his version of the story .
