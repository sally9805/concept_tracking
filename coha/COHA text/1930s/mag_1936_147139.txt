Fishing on his 2,000-acre ranch in the Black Hills of Wyoming , Moses Louis Annenberg heard last month that the Philadelphia Inquirer could be purchased by anyone who had a desire to own a large morning newspaper and $15,000,000 in cash . Mr. Annenberg had both . Forthwith he sent one of the five Annenberg sons-in-law to Paris to dicker with the Inquirer 's socialite owners , Mme Eleanore Elverson Paternotre and her sleek son Raymond , onetime Undersecretary of State for National Economy , member of the Chamber of Deputies and publisher of the Paris Petit Journal . Last week the deal went through . From his modest Manhattan offices , Purchaser Annenberg announced that he was taking over active control of the Inquirer at once , that he had no backers , that the Inquirer would continue a stanch Republican sheet . <P> Philadelphia 's oldest morning daily , the Inquirer was founded in 1829 and bought by Colonel James Elverson 60 years later . Colonel Elverson 's daughter , an international belle , married French Ambassador Jules Paternotre in the 1890 's , inherited the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it within a year to Cyrus Hermann Kotzschmar Curtis and his stepson-in-law John C. Martin for part cash , part credit . <P> Under the Curtis-Martin ownership the Inquirer started downhill to failure . Combining it with the famed old Public Ledger failed to slow its descent . In 1934 the Inquirer bounced back on the Paternotres when the Curtis-Martin interests could no longer pay off their recurrent notes . Still carrying the old Ledger nameplate , * the Inquirer was administered for its absentee owners by Publisher Charles A. Tyler . Morning competition in Philadelphia was supplied by rambunctious New Dealer J. ( for Julius ) David Stern and his bustling Record ( circulation : 221,927 ) . When the Paternotres sold out for $15,000,000 cash last week , the Inquirer had a daily circulation of 277.994 , nearly 700,000 on Sundays . ( Peak circulation , in 1934 : 295,735 . ) Philadelphia newsmen guessed that the new management would oust Publisher Tyler and oldtime Editor John T. Custis , keep most of the staff .              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
