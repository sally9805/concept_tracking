Why Should the Jews Survive ? I THIS ESSAY would not have been written at this hour , had it not been for the dark hour of the German Jews . But their catastrophe is the deepening , within the crisis of the world , of a threat that for two centuries has gathered against Jewry . Judaism has never solved the challenge of the modern world ; and this challenge is now a crisis ? one of those historic crises from which Jewry must be reborn , if at all , through the threshold of death . I do not stop to swell the lamentations that the fate of half a million highly cultured Jews has aroused in all sane people . My object is more stern . It is to analyze the response of the Jews , particularly in the United States , to Hitler : to expose and study from the response certain traits of modern Jewry . There has been , in all the tears and rage , one constant refrain . " Why are we persecuted ? " cry the leaders . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of thought , conduct or allegiance , that counts . In Germany we are good Germans ; in America , we are good Americans . There is no reason for this persecution . " Now , Jews have often suffered persecution ; although I suspect never by such ruthlessly efficient methods as the German . But Jews have always known why they were maltreated . It was because they were different ; in thought , in conduct , in allegiance , in all that counted , a peculiar people . It was because they were Jews . This reason might cause great sacrifice . But since Jewishness was the treasure of their lives , source of their beauty and Joy , they deemed even the price of persecution not too great to pay for being Jewish . They took the persecution for granted , meeting it as shrewdly as they could . The stress of their energy and will was focused , not on avoiding or denying reasons for persecution , but on being Jews . Here , then , is an : enormous difference . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jewry do not know why they are persecuted : for the first time they disclaim any reason for persecution . This sheds new light on the German Jewish disaster . Are these half-million victims to be considered undifferentiatedly as suffering human beings ? Then they deserve no more pity and help ? no more and of course no less ? than the millions of other sufferers of our dark age : than the Negroes of our South , for instance ; than the countless families broken by unemployment ; than the Communists whom Hitler and the Balkan sadists are torturing and maiming . But such pooled pity does not satisfy the Jewish leaders . In their appeals and reports they are careful to separate their cause from others . They imply that German Jewry calls for more than its quantitative share of the concern of a world riven with anguish ; they assume , indeed , that a great people , whose value to mankind is high , is being menaced . Now this claim , on the evidence of the past , can be denied by no intelligent man . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Western world that are inestimable , and organic . But are not the contemporary leaders confused in time ? Should the Jews be saved today for what they were in the past ? Such a plea runs counter to all natural law . What is there alive in contemporary Jewry to distinguish it from any other quantitative group of human beings ? The answer , alas ! is , there is nothing . There are still , it is true , traditional Jewish communes in Eastern Europe and North Africa . But we do not hear from them ; they provide no Jewish leaders . Indeed , the modern world no longer gives them nurture or function , and they are doomed by their own archaic form . The Jewry that protests against Hitlerism and is menaced by it the world over , and that assumes its past worth as argument for its pres. ent survival , is a modern " progressive " Jewry , divorced from that past . It is the Jewry that cries : " Why are we persecuted ? Let us examine it , then , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jews of the United States . First , I must define the Jew ; and this , fortunately , can be done without raising the old problems of race and nation . To be a Jew has always meant to live a certain way of life : a way which , evolving with the ages and with the cultural-economic conditions of the lands , was yet an organic growth from a single tradition . This tradition was one ; and the Jewish groups made it organic with their lives . Other nations had prophets , the Jews enacted theirs . Other nations had arts , the Jews lived theirs . Other peoples had high standards for personal , communal and cosmic relations : the Jews , by the minutiae of their 613 commandments , made flesh and bone of their vision . The defining Jewish trait is unification of value into an organic body of behavior . The defining Jewish term is action . And now , outside the vanishing old-world ghettoes of our East Side , where are the Jews ? Where in New York , in Cincinnati , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as divided in his ideals and his behavior as any Gentile . His amusements and his arts , his family life and his business methods , his loyalties to class , state and God , are the same tissue of contradictions . Like any Gentile , he scrambles for the dollar , lives for his belly , shares in the stampede for cheap delights . As business man , he also exploits his brother ; as citizen , he votes for the same liars , crude or gilded . He shouts the same chauvinistic phrases and is ready , with the rest , in time of war , to rush with the courage of Gadarene swine to his destruction . He enjoys ( and writes ) the same inane novels , movies . In a society whose crucial trait is the abyss between ideal and deed , he ? the Jew ? is indistinguishable from his neighbor . Is the " Jewishness " of these modern Jews a dynamic and totalistic pattern of action ? or is it a mere moldering heap of sentiment , vanity and habit ? I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rank and file , the humble clerks and clothing workers , artisans and mechanics . These , as Jews , are passive . And in so far as they have Jewish leaders to make them act ( as contradistin. ; guished from labor leaders , for example ) , they choose the very type who have grown great by shrewd collaboration with a world that is the antithesis , in every value , to what is Jewish . This is a cardinal point in the lethal condition of American Jewry . Its leaders and spokesmen , in their loyalty to the exploiting class , have dangerously identified the Jew with a bourgeoisie that is degenerate and doomed . In the middle ages , the Jew was allied functionally with the rising burgher class whose destiny it was to break the feudal system . This alliance was one reason for the Jew 's survival . But burgherdom , in medieval Europe , played a different moral part from the grande bourgeoisie of today . In the realm of practicable action , the burgherdom stood for social justice and intellectual freedom , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Technically , the profit system always meant exploitation of labor . But socially , this early bourgeois exploitation was in the direction of justice , since it spread the margin of leisure whereby man 's culture could alone advance . Until the invention of the machine , some exploitation of men was needed in order that a privileged portion of mankind could think ? and at last , by inventing the machine , and spreading possible leisure to all humanity , abolish the need of human exploitation altogether . The alliance of medieval Jewry with hurgherdom was therefore within the rhythm of advancing social justice and hence harmonious with Jewishness . But today , the dominant bourgeoisie is the power of stratified social injustice : it is the power of war , of spiritual death and intellectual ruin . The intensity of American Jewish allegiance to the exploiting class can be measured by the lives of the prominent Jewish leaders . I consider one to whom the American Jews have almost unanimously turned in the present crisis . They officially replied to Hitler with the boycott . They have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human liberty : careful to insist that , as Jews , they are concerned with the fate not of German radicals or workers , but of German Jews . And the captain of this sectarian gesture is Samuel Untermyer . Mr. Untermyer is a lawyer who has grown rich by interpreting the game of grab for American corpora . tions ( largely Gentile , of course ) more shrewdly than most advocates of Big Business . He has shown , at times , a mild concern for the interests'of the public against the utility highwaymen ; but never , never remotely , to the length of weakening in his active support of a system whose cornerstone is exploitation . This man , undistinguishable in quality of mind and spirit and life from thousands of other divided men , is a , leader in American Jewry . And his implicit collaboration with the conspirators of wealth against the principle of social justice that is an axiom of Jewish unity between value and deed , is shared by our leading rabbis and our professional Jewish writers ? Ludwig Lewisohn , for instance . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their ideals , therefore of the Jewish essence . Is a folk that such men lead a Jewish folk ? A trait of Jewry , following from the Jewish premise that value and vision must become action , has been to set up true Jewish leaders . But it may be said , there are other Jews , greater than these : not necessarily American , yet the real leaders of Jewry . There are Albert Einstein , Sigmund Freud , Alfred Stieglitz , Henri Bergson , Leon Trotsky .. ? others . These men are great , and are leaders , and are Jews . But they are not leaders of Jews . They are leaders of scientists , philosophers , artists , revolutionists . They and other great Jewish men of our times are products of Jewish life ; but modern Jewry can not claim them . They are the offspring of the old communal Jewry which still existed in their formative years . And the fact that they have been forced to function quite outside modern Jewry is another proof of its present dissolution . The Jewish world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ products of its spirit , of its intellectual discipline and of its sense of life , leave the parent body . And the world of Jews , in deadly division from the Jewish spirit , chooses leaders who hasten its death . Consider now the pitiful , the ironical condition of the Jew . To suffer for a cause that our soul loves is bearable : is , indeed ? since we must suffer ? man 's most enviable destiny . But to suffer for nothing ! To be hated and ruined as a Jew , when one 's life is not Jewish ! The Jews of Germany , taken as a whole , exist inertially because their past way was Jewish and because it takes more than a generation to destroy a way of life so strong and so vital . If two hundred years ago , they had ceased living as Jews , Hitler and the Nazis , who are ignorant men , would probably not have heard of them . He persecutes them now because in a confused way he has inherited what was a real reason , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to dislike real Jews who had so much to do with its creating . But that is only half the picture . The Jews are allied with an agonizing and desperate middle class . Nyhen that class flourished , the Jews , functioning in it , were tolerated by it . Now that it droops and its spoils dwindle , it turns ? like a man in a panic ? against its weaker neighbor . It is the principle of " every man for himself " ? the basic law of bourgeois life . 0 the ironical confusion in the fate of the modern Jew ! He is persecuted by barbarous and desperate men because of ideals that he no longer lives : and he is persecuted by a class to which , in the main , he is loyal , because he is a rival of its barbarous way of life ? a way that contradicts his own ideals ! This is Germany today : who doubts that with variations it may be America tomorrow ? that it may be any capitalistic country where the Jew , in his present @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and in his past a reminder of the liberal culture of the Western world , against which that desperate class is in revolt ? Now for the final questions : How can the Jew survive in the modern world , and why should he survive ? To answer clearly , I must first state some of the reasons why he survived in the past . And since the kaleidoscope of Jewish generations is so great , I take the latest period of undisputed Jewish health : the middle ages ( which lasted for the Jews until the eighteenth century ) , when the Jews lived , harmonious and whole , within a Europe of violent divisions , and often savagely hostile . I. Jewry 's strict unity of ideal and conduct made the community , although small and surrounded , an efficient body . All its energy was conserved for itself and applied functionally for survival ; whereas in a greater community where value and deed are divided , there is conflict , loss of energy , disease . 2 . In Judaism , both ideally and actively , there was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alexandrian and Platonized Egypt corrupted the ancient Hebrew knowledge that there is no personal immortality , this superstition of a surviving individual soul ( the deepest cause of the failure of European cultures ) was never strong against the healthy Jewish unification of individual and commune . Therefore , medieval Jewry had no destructive egoism ? no " great men " ? to mislead it for discordant personal ends . ( The egoistic leader battens on the accumulated egoisms of his rabble . ) In Jewry , the leaders were as organic to the commune as an eye or a brain to the body . Moreover , these leaders were not soldiers , not megaloinaniacs of fame and money : they were the seers and the thinkers . Here then was a social body whose eyes and brain literally led it ? incontrast to our modern world in which the eye and the brain are discards or decorations . 3 . Jewry had , despite theological and cultural differences , a deep community of values with Christian cultural leaders . They recognized the worth of the Jewish ethic ; the beauty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ human action . The best in Christian Europe at all times respected , and often learned from , the " hated " Jews . And during the ages when the Church was strong , they had enough influence to defend the Jews against extremities of persecution . 4 . Through these times , Jewry had an economic function . Its activities in international commerce , banking , exchange and in the practical sciences of communication and of navigation , did a necessary work in feudal Europe . And this allied Jewry with the strug. gling middle class ? the burghers who were to inherit and transform feudal Europe . Without this function and the alliance with a rising economic class , Jewry 's inner harmony of action could not have saved it . For there would have been lacking a harmony of function within the larger body of the Gentile world . To return , now , to our time ; the Jew obviously can survive , if the immutable essence of the Jewish social organism can somehow be transformed to function in the modern world . And obviously , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has a part to play before mankind . These questions are the subject for a book ? which I shall write , if I live long enough to become a Jew . Here , I can but sketch my answer . The Jewish principle ? unity of value and deed , of person and group ? has a dual form . ? That the personal will harmonize with the community , there must be social justice . And that within the communal life ( which includes economics and politics ) , there may be nurtured the values of the individual soul , there must be God . What did God mean to the Jews ? At first by miracle , at last by natural law ; at first confusedly , at last rationally and clearly , God meant the dynamic immanence , in the world of matter and of man , of what the individual recognized within himself as his own deepest worth . God meant the principle of order , the will to unity , in a chaotic multiverse ; and the creative place of every man and woman in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world which men , gropingly , called divine . In a word , God meant goodness ... and life . We may now see why the Jewish individual-social organism broke in the impact with the modern world . Modern industrialism destroyed the simple , paternalistic economy under which the Jewish commune approximated social justice . And modern thought and science corroded the theologicethic form under which the Jew knew God . To survive , the Jewish principle must be transfigured into modern terms . Judaism would have to embrace an again workable program approximating social justice ; and that means the unequivocal destruction of the anarchy called industrial capitalism . And Judaism would have to redefine what it has al . ways meant ? or meant to mean ? by God . Now , let the reader answer : Is the ' principle of social justice needed today ? And that Man may live , must there be , not an ant-hill system , but a living social form that nurtures the inward need of every human being to create and to share his inward vision and values ? If your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world of what has been , with evolving clarity , for nearly thirty hundred years , the Jewish principle . And as if history urged that this cardinal dual need of the world may yet be the peculiar business of the Jewish people ( there have always been , in all nations , saintly and isolated men who lived and died for it , as greatly as any Jew ) , the need stands most forcibly answered in the work of two Jews ? Jews of a " new remnant , " Marx and Spinoza . I place Marx first , because in the perspective of function , he comes first ? although Spinoza lived two centuries before him and profoundly influenced his thinking . Marx , from the Jewish premise of history as an organism evolving toward " good , " has given to the industrial world a realistic logic and a technique of social justice . Time , of course , has amended or refuted many details of his plan ; yet it is none the less categorical that every man who wants to enact social justice in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may reject certain Marxist dogmas . The modern Jew , if he is to exist , must interpret Marx as a prophet as surely as his forebears interpreted Moses and Isaiah . Marx ( despite chronology ) comes before Spinoza . Because the social discord is a disease immediately threatening the survival of civilized mankind ; and because collective consciousness comes before true self-consciousness . Marx without Spinoza is an imperative , immediate , primitive first step in action . Spinoza , without Marx , remains an abstract philosophy , removed from possible action . But as Marx is the man who most surely projected the prophetic aspiration of social justice into a workable modern program , Spinoza is the prophet who has completed the depersonalizing and purifying of the knowledge of God into the God of inwardness , of substance and of action . If Marx carries on Moses and Ezra , Spinoza carries on Isaiah and Jesus . It is he who has best established the organic being of God in matter and in human thought ; who has made rational the ancient mystic intuition that the cosmic dwells @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-conscious . By giving value to matter in a form acceptable to the age of science , Spinoza will crown the work of Marx , who gives reality to a program of social justice in the age of machines . Now , it may be that Spinoza and Marx are the swan-song of Jewry : the final message of a great people before its ultimate death . It may be that the work of unifying and enacting their contributions shall fall to other peoples . There is Russia in the world , and China , and there are the two Americas : from such virgin - soil may come the fulfilment of the prophets . I do not know . But I do know that , if the Jew is to survive as an organic group , he must enact . his modern prophets as his fathers ( after rejecting them , also ) enacted the prophets of Scripture . And I conclude these pages by broadly sketching what the modern Jewish way of living must be . To begin with ( for , I repeat ? in the field of action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renounce loyalty to the exploiting class . Without that , all his " service " is a " vain oblation . " Today , as twenty-six centuries ago , the word of the prophet is true : Bring no more vain oblations ; It is an offering of abomination unto Me ; New moon and sabbath , the holding of convocations ? I can not endure iniquity along with solemn assembly .... Cease to do evil ; Learn to do well ; Seek justice .... " Learn to do well ! " In our industrial world , this means active allegiance to the class whose historic function it is to abolish economic exploitation ? the base of social injustice ? by doing away with economic classes altogether . This new allegiance will not be easy ; since the Jews for centuries have been forced to earn their bread within the middle class , it will have the value , by itself , of a religious conversion . But this new loyalty as a group does not mean that the Jew will be submerged in the working class or in any proletarian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ workers ( and the farmer and the intellectual , too , are workers ) , help them with his brain and body ; but he may be detached from them , at least at present , because of his particular stewardship of individual values ? " the realm of God , " in each man , with which the harried and hungry worker has not had time to grow familiar . The revolutionary proletariat can not trouble about God . There are good functional reasons for the atheism of the Marxists . The word God has been monopolized so long by the apologists of the class of exploitation : theologians , philosophers , poets ! To detach ( as Spinoza did ) the reality in God from all the accumulated lies is a problem that calls for subtlety beyond the present anguished state of the masses ; for energy that the masses and their immediate leaders can not spare from the day 's struggle . It is unhistorical to expect the active revolutionist of our time to do more than reject the false " God " of the churches and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the heat of revolutionary battle , must not die . When the first Marxist ends are won and man is freed from animal penury and fear into the human stage of security and leisure , the individual must find life good : and this can be only through the Spinozistic sense of God . Against that liberated day , the experience of the divine in mortal life must be preserved . Wherefore , there is need today of a people , scattered through the nations , that know and nurture the experience of God . By the tradition of ages , by their ancient prophets and their modern thinkers , the Jews have inherited the challenge and the right to be such a people . This Jewish " remnant " ? and only the remnant , through the ages , has preserved the Jew ? will be loyal to the class of social revolution ; but through its consciousness of God it will be still separate , and must remain so . It will understand its functional ' " atheism , " and not demand that it be understood in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret treasure it must lovingly preserve against the day when men , free of fear and hunger , learn to look within themselves where God is . Thus , the Jews will still be a peculiar people . And they will be subject to the dislike and distrust of the proletarian zealot for whom the word God is anathema ; although it was in the name of God that his values of social justice and individual dignity were preserved and prepared , through the barbaric ages . Now , a majority can not rise to so high a challenge of rebirth . Bankers , merchants , lawyers , professional men and politicians , even artisans and mechanics among the Jews , will not yield their old allegiance to the middle class , although that class turns ( as it is turning ! ) against them . And these will disappear in the general human welter , as Jews have disappeared in Assyria , Babylon , Alexandria and Rome . But what a magnificent remnant there may be ! The teacher , the doctor , the engineer , theclear-eyed man of commerce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the student ? above all , the Jewish student I Already , these are on the side of the productive class that alone holds the energy to remake the world . Already , they accept Marx . Let them fulfill this knowledge with devotion to the inward value ? the God whom Spinoza has explored in man and in matter ? and there will be again , in the world , a Jewish remnant ! Persecution ? It is already here , even in America ; and as the capitalistic era shrinks , darkens and despairs , it will grow worse . The lesson of Hitler in offering the Jew as the traditional scapegoat for the accumulated rage of a bewildered people , is bound to be learned ; already we have our little Hiders , profiteers of suffering stupidity and blindness . The Jewish people are going to suffer . And for those who are individually and innocently hurt , and who know not why , there can be no soothing words . Before their anguish , we can only bow our heads , humbly , as they enact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the conscious Jew , the real Jew , there will again be reason for Jewishness , reason to bear his persecution ; and comrades to help him bear it . And if individual Jews die , their death will be in the cause of humane life ; and no man can ask a higher guerdon . And the history of the Jews will hearten them with knowledge , that when a people is ready to be persecuted and to die for a good cause , the cause lives ? and the people .
