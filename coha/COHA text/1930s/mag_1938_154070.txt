Startled by the report that Japanese were outside the walls of Changsha , midway between Hankow and Canton , zealous city officials last week hurried to carry out their " scorched earth " policy ( to destroy everything of value to the invaders ) . They made the mistake of forgetting to warn the populace in time . Fire roared through the city so fast that thousands of families were trapped . Firefighters struggled for five days before the flames were brought under control . Some 2,000 Chinese were burned to death , more injured . <P> A bigger mistake of the Changsha officials was their failure to inform themselves that the Japanese were still 58 miles away from the city . Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek meted out punishment for both errors . He reputedly ordered Changsha 's garrison commander , chief of police and commander of the provincial troops executed for their " premature zeal . "
