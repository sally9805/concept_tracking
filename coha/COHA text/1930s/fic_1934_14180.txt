An illumination of the darkness discloses the edge of a wide field late in the afternoon of an April day . At the back is a hedgerow of dogwood , sassafras shrubs , and wild flowers about waist-high and glowing with a medley of colors in the slanting light . A sandy road , white as a bleached oyster shell , runs parallel to this hedge , and beyond it a forest of loblolly pines dark and unfathomable stretches away in the distance . In the deep of the sky above the forest 's rim , the huge ball of the sun glows like a red apocalyptic eye . Inside the hedge is a little wired-off plot about twice the size of a bed-frame which encloses a single grave set with a small twin-headed white tombstone . The low fence around it is buried in a roll of honeysuckle and trumpet vine , and the ground before it is carpeted with the thick jade green of early broomsedge . The scene is empty , and silent at first then gradually the low murmur of the wind among the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the tired expiring sigh of some great being . The breathing floats along the air and among the hedges  --  sounding in the fields and over the grassy ground in a low drumming harmony , saying to itself , " Hush  --  hush , the Great God day is going down ! " TAPLEY JONES comes out at the end of the field rows by the hedge carrying a small bundle of green tobacco plants in one hand and a setting-peg in the other . He is a stout , clumpy old farmer of seventy or seventyfive , his face puffy and grizzled and his citrous yellow eyes deep-sunk and dropsical . As he walks , his bent torso continuously moves from left to right and back again with a sort of pivotal motion of his hips , describing in its motion an arc of about forty degrees . For a moment he stands swaying himself and then sits drown on a stump at the left slowly and with the care of an old ape arranging himself on a box . A deep " Ah " rattles out of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he gazes out before him in the direction from whence he came , raising and lowering his head rhythmically now that his body is still . TAPLEY JONES ( With a croaky murmur . ) Fair and purty the world is  --  Fair and purty , and God made it so . ( After a moment of silence , COLIN SPENCE 'S voice answers him in the fields at the left  --  slow and disinterested. ) p. 3 COLIN 'S VOICE You speak to me ? TAPLEY JONES ( Murmuring . ) The pink of the evening shetting in And God 's great lamp gone fading out  --  ah . Sundown or no sundown , I 'll rest my bones . ( The monosyllables falling from his lips slow and monotonously . ) Rest  --  rest  --  rest , the Good Book says . For thirty years I 've bent my back . I 've done my share of work , Blistering in the fiery fields . COLIN 'S VOICE ( As before , off at the left . ) Yeh-yeh . TAPLEY JONES ( Musing . ) That 's so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( With a touch of pride . ) And the plants I set , they live , They always live . I know how to pack the dirt around the roots . ( He casts his eye at the grave a moment , then goes on as before . ) I got a growing hand for tobacco plants , No poison in it  --  No poison sweat in the palm ; I got a growing hand . I minister to and make ' em live . COLIN 'S VOICE Yeh-yeh TAPLEY JONES ( Rising from the stump and stamping back and forth in the scene . ) The drought of ninety-three , I remember , Burnt the stalks to the ground in the fields . The sun it scorched my back like a heating iron , But I kept on putting the plants in the earth . I put'em down deep , To the bud I put ' em down , And the dew would cup up in there till twelve o ' the clock  --  Aye , Colin  --  and more . p. 4 COLIN 'S VOICE ( Presently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and scripturally sarcastic . ) When the sun goes down the world is set for sleep . So man should be . ( He sits down on the stump again . ) COLIN SPENCE ( Coming in from the left . ) Yeh-yeh . Mr. Graham did n't say rest . Finish this field ' fore night , he said , Right to the last row , he did . ( Colin is a slender , freckle-faced youth of twenty , with bent shoulders and a stiffish neck from long toil at the plow and a farm 's back-breaking work . His eyes are blue and mild , but his parched , tight lips and somewhat protruding chin give him a stern , preoccupied look much in contrast to the youthful frankness of his eyes and brow . His huge toil-harsh hands hang down like mauls attached to a pair of long rawhide arms . He also carries a bunch of young tobacco plants and a peg . He keeps his face half-averted from the grave and stands looking across the field . ) TAPLEY JONES We ca n't finish without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right soon , he said . I 'll be there in a jiffy , yes , he said . ( He stares off across the fields . ) I wish he 'd hurry and come . p. 5 TAPLEY JONES Hurry-hurry-hurry . Like a house a-burning down . And big scramble is little gamble . ( Testily . ) Rest your back till he comes . ( COLIN starts to sit down and then , as if struck by an unhappy thought , rises and sits down on the ground over at the right . TAPLEY chuckles softly and kindly , working his head . ) Ah , poor fellow , and what can he do ? COLIN SPENCE Let me set here and rest . Rest , that 's all . TAPLEY JONES Do n't be afeared . A grave was never known to bite you  --  hoom  --  Not with his crumbling gums , it wo n't . COLIN SPENCE ( Holding up his fists and looking at them . ) Never said it would . Never remember saying it would . And a grave ai n't a " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the grave has jaws  --  " Jaws of the grave . " ( Thinking and pushing his upper lip against his nose with his lower . ) Once on a Tuesday fair as this Was when we dug it there . ( Clearing his throat . ) Bees were humming hum-hum  --  And the dog-flies rousing in the mash , And the goslings whistling in the pond below the house . ( Quotingly . ) " Honey in the comb so sweet , so sweet . " Sorrow is bound to be ! "  --  Seven years ago that day was , A Tuesday when it happened so . And after seven years a grave wo n't bite you . p. 6 COLIN SPENCE ( Mumbling ) . Yeh-yeh . TAPLEY JONES ( Now chanting his work poetry , and apparently forgetful of whatever outward subject the present one is . ) Deep to the bud and clean to the little leaf Set your plants if you want ' em to live . But never clod the little leaf , For the little leaf is the mouth . Like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plant is made from the dirt , Colin , But it wo n't eat dirt . COLIN SPENCE ( Coldly . ) Yeh , dirt unto dirt , the preacher says . TAPLEY JONES I 've been out at three in the evening , The dew was still in the little bud , And the hummingbirds all green and gold Would be drinking from ' em since the mid of day  --  ( He bends over and pushes his tobacco peg into the loamy earth , sticks a plant into the hole and with two sharp pats packs the dirt tight around it. )  --  So . ( With a pleased , toothless grin . ) Every year Mr. Graham says  --  he says When the pine mast falls And the round-eyed squirrels are still  --  " Once more , Tapley , we start a crop . And we could n't do without you . " ( Soberly . ) I set tobacco for his father too ; Mergens of yellow gold he had , And nigger-rich the old man was , Before ever any trouble came , And sorrow was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He gestures toward the grave. ) p. 7 COLIN SPENCE Yeh , back in the old time  --  TAPLEY JONES ' Way  --  ' way back . ( As COLIN takes out his knife and begins to whittle on his setting peg . ) That 's it , it is  --  my daddy said , " Whatever happens , keep a sharp peg . " That fits a lot of holes Both square and round . And there 's naught so sharp that time wo n't blunt it . He spoke up wise on his dying day  --  too . Say , one anvil wears many hammers out . COLIN SPENCE A smart man  --  anh ? TAPLEY JONES Smart . COLIN SPENCE ( Smiling to himself . ) And could prophesy out the meaning of dreams ? TAPLEY JONES ( Sharply . ) No , that 's a gift was given to me . COLIN SPENCE Ho-ho ! TAPLEY JONES A gift to me . I come in this world with a web on my face . " Goddle-mighty , he 's gifted ! " The old granny woman squealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweat on her twisted lips . COLIN SPENCE Yeh yeh . TAPLEY JONES ( Mysteriously . ) But a baby laid by a carrion crow And hatched by the sun  --  aha  --  Now that 's something else  --  aha ! p. 8 COLIN SPENCE ( Hurt . ) Here now ! TAPLEY JONES Oh , I ai n't talking ' bout your pappy  --  um  --  Peace to his soul whoever he was . ( Comfortably . ) Anyhow , he were n't a Graham , and that 's a good thing , Woods colt or no woods colt . COLIN SPENCE ( Suddenly as he looks off to the right . ) There comes somebody I do n't want to meet , No more'n she wants to meet me  --  I 'm going for water there at the spring . ( He takes an empty glass jar from behind the stump and hurries off at the left . A woman 's voice is heard softly singing in the distance at the right . ) WOMAN 'S VOICE ( Approaching . ) O lay her low , low lay her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the robin cry  --  ( ELLEN JANE enters behind the hedge from the right . She is a woman of middle age with the marks of fading beauty in her hurt face and dark fireless eyes . She wears a wide-brimmed yellow-ribboned straw hat pulled down so that its drooping edges at the back rest on her shoulders , giving her the appearance somewhat of a fluffy , crippled bird . She peeps over the hedge at the grave , carrying on her song the while. ) p. 9 ELLEN JANE Go twang the silver thread  --  The turtledove flies in the sun And westward flies my love . ( Her voice trailing off . ) Sing eat green willows And drink salt tears  --  ( Murmuring toward the grave . ) Sleep and rest , my beautiful ones , Sleep and rest ! TAPLEY JONES ( Hoarsely , without looking around . ) They do , Ellen Jane , they do . Go along now , go along home . ELLEN JANE ( Startled . ) You 're not my friend , Tapley Jones . You 're not my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that suffer . ( He rises again and clumps back and forth in the scene , never looking in her direction . ) ELLEN JANE Your are Oscar 's friend , And I am afraid of you . And Oscar is afraid of sinful me . TAPLEY JONES Oscar Graham fears only God . ELLEN JANE Repentance , repentance for him . ( Loudly . ) I do not repent I loved him . His God is not my God . ( Singing . ) O with his arms about me  --  Tweet , tweet and pally-oh  --  Would it were ever so . p. 10 TAPLEY JONES ( Calling out sternly . ) He is coming with tobacco plants  --  Go on , go on ! ELLEN JANE Yes , yes . ( Crying out . ) Where is Lora ?  --  I want to find Lora ! TAPLEY JONES ( Still pacing up and down and never looking at her . ) You leave Lora alone  --  Oscar Graham says leave her alone . ELLEN JANE Yes , yes , O my poor soul ! I loved him  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arms about me  --  His mouth on mine  --  his body  --  TAPLEY JONES Stop it ! ELLEN JANE Tell Lora  --  tell her  --  ( Looking off . ) There he comes  --  ugly Colin  --  And ugly is sinful . Do n't you , do n't you let him marry Lora . Ah  --  ( She turns and moves back the way she came , resuming her song . ) O lay her low , low lay her head Deep down and let her lie . ( COLIN reenters at the left . He stops and stares off after ELLEN JANE . ) COLIN SPENCE Always singing that sad moan song  --  ( He gestures the water jar toward TAPLEY who shakes his head . He replaces the jar by the stump. ) p. 11 TAPLEY JONES Anh . ( He reseats himself . ) COLIN SPENCE ( Gazing at TAPLEY 'S back , perplexed . ) About a body laid away , Creepy she is ! TAPLEY JONES Beauty is as beauty does And ugliness the same . COLIN SPENCE ( Angrily . ) There you go again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ JONES ( Loftily . ) Well , it ai n't my song she 's singing . COLIN SPENCE ( Gazing off after her again . ) Who 's she hunting for , all moon-mad , With her green willows and salt tears ? TAPLEY JONES ( Snapping . ) I did n't say she 's hunting  --  ( Lifting his chin . ) Hyack  --  hyack here , The wind 's freshened a bit like rain . ( As if reciting his tired folk wisdom from a book . ) When the warmth of the day dies down And the cold of the night comes on , A little wind fumbles about the world , Saying , " Where is my home , where is it ? " COLIN SPENCE ( With a half-irritated gesture . ) Ah  --  you and your schoolhouse talk . ( He reseats himself on the ground , his face thoughtful . ) Anh , poor thing , it wrings my heart . p. 12 TAPLEY JONES ( Musing . ) What is it , Colin ? COLIN SPENCE ( Abstractedly . ) What 's what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ COLIN SPENCE ( With sudden loudness . ) It 's the wind , And the wind ai n't nothing . Never anything , And nothing but the wind . TAPLEY JONES Oh-ho ! COLIN SPENCE Maybe the wind 's a ghost and you ca n't see it And a ghost ai n't nothing . A hog can see the wind , but I ai n't no hog . TAPLEY JONES But the wind moves , it moves , Moves slow , moves strong . Now soft against your face like a baby 's hand , Now slapping down a tree or tearing away your barn . Listen to it prooning in the pines now , Their high heads bending like the lonesome bullrush . Must be something . Ah ! COLIN SPENCE ( Now with no further interest in the subject . ) Call it a varmint and it 's still the wind  --  Whining in the mushy swamps or on dry land . TAPLEY JONES ( Again as if speaking to an impersonal world . ) It goeth where it listeth and returneth , To the north and the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as stubble before it , And as chaff that the storm carrieth away . p. 13 COLIN SPENCE ( Restlessly . ) Mr. Graham said he 'd bring the plants soon . TAPLEY JONES And if he do n't tomorrow 'll come the same . COLIN SPENCE ( Relishingly . ) Tomorrow  --  come , tomorrow , and come soon , And Lora and me  --  TAPLEY JONES Hurry , hurry , hurry  --  Like a house burning down , Like a man in his own popping grease . A catfish gagged on his own hook , Jerk , jerk , jerk ! Well , fret and fry never shod the mule . ( Gruffly . ) Gim me your frogsticker . ( COLIN hands him the knife , and TAPLEY cuts off a piece from a plug of tobacco which he carries in a tin box , puts it into his mouth , and begins mommicking his jaws up and down . ) COLIN SPENCE ( Chuckling derisively . ) You still drink water with ambeer and all ? Wonder it do n't give you the stink rot gut And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ninety-one , Said he had an inch of snuff Coated round his liver to protect him  --  Death to germs and wiggle tails . ( He closes the knife and starts to put it into his own pocket , but COLIN reaches out firmly and takes it . ) Oh , yes ,  --  and dreams ?  --  He had ' em much . He dreamed his old black cow could read  --  He saw her setting by his Rayo lamp , Wearing his specs and coat , she was , Reading out loud in Greek  --  From a book all yellow and bound in iron , she read . ( Spitting . ) I told him what it meant . p. 14 COLIN SPENCE Oh , yes . TAPLEY JONES A cow that threaded a needle with her hoof And sewed upon a shroud , A-setting there in the pale lamplight Wearing his Stetson hat . COLIN SPENCE ( Listlessly . ) And what did it mean ? TAPLEY JONES Ask Old Sawyer when you see him . COLIN SPENCE Why , he 's dead long ago . TAPLEY JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . ( Staring at a patch of sunlight fading on the grass before him and weaving his hand back and forth above it . ) He 's slipping on down to rest  --  ah  --  Sol-sola-solis . COLIN SPENCE Unh ?  --  What 's that ? TAPLEY JONES I learned it when a boy  --  Latin  --  At Little Bethel school . At crippled teacher taught me Had been over the salt sea water . Smart he was  --  too smart for folks . " Brass , brass , " he 'd sing , " Though the top of heaven falls And fee-larks twitter in the world . " Sol-sola-solis ! COLIN SPENCE ( Weary but ironical still . ) Sol-la-ti-do . TAPLEY JONES ( Singing . ) Do-mi-sol-do !  --  Unh . ( Clearing his throat with a hacking sound . ) Like a leaf man 's life doth fade . ( Calling as if to a person behind him . ) Heigh , old sun , I 'll see you tomorrow morn ! Let my weary eyes behold thee ! ( He bows his head and puts the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prayer . COLIN shifts around where he sits and stares off. ) p. 15 COLIN SPENCE Ah , but that sun he do look big ! Big enough to scare you . Like a fiery millrock falling towards the world . Many and many a time I felt ' t would sqush me . What 's it made of ? TAPLEY JONES Brass-brass-brass . Or a red-hot ball of iron , the teacher said . COLIN SPENCE It 'd fall from the sky if it was heavy iron . Ho-ho , it 'd fall to rise no more ! TAPLEY JONES ( With sudden and great sanctimony . ) The Great I Am upholds it in his hand . Muscle power and strength it is Keeping it to its path . COLIN SPENCE Lora read her schoolbook , saying A man hauls it ' crost the sky in a great rumbling wagon . The horses run away one day and swooped close by the earth Singeing and scorching things , Niggers were made that day , Burnt brown and black . TAPLEY JONES ( Mockingly scandalized . ) Blessed goodness he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like Lora . You never believe a word she says . Why ? Why ? TAPLEY JONES We were talking about the sun . COLIN SPENCE Unh-hunh , and I know the sun , Know what it is and evermore shall be  --  It 's the poor man 's clock . ( Getting up suddenly . ) And it says , get to work and finish this field . p. 16 TAPLEY JONES Mr. Graham 's coming in a minute . COLIN SPENCE ( With determination as he stops . ) Why do n't you like Lora ? TAPLEY JONES Who 's said what about who ? ( His mouth opening and his eyes shutting as he recites . ) William Tremble-Toe he 's a good fisherman . Ketches hens , puts ' em in pens  --  Some lays eggs , some do n't  --  Why and why , you say ? ( Cocking his eye and staring off . ) One day I was sweating in these same fields . In the blistering midday weather I was . The sun had baked the white salt Through the woof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sassafras bush I was easing my galded hide . Mr. Graham stopped at my side and said , " Tapley , I had a dream last night , " he said , " So bad it was I could n't sleep a wink . " And when he told me what it was , I said , " Trouble 's coming on somebody you love . " ( Gesturing toward the grave . ) And it did the very next day  --  a Tuesday . You were a little pop-squirt then , Your mammy 's milk still caked on your chin . COLIN SPENCE What 's that got to do with Lora ? TAPLEY JONES They 're Lora 's sisters buried there , And that 's enough to know . p. 17 COLIN SPENCE What did Mr. Graham dream ? TAPLEY JONES He dreamed a dream . And it were n't no writing on a wall , But I could read it just the same . They should a-named me Daniel  --  Ho-ho ! COLIN SPENCE ( With a touch of bitterness . ) Smart for an old man  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) So smart I caught a wampus once asleep . Down where the eel-grass grows it was . ' Od drot it , I did COLIN SPENCE Jesus , God , and what 's a wampus ? TAPLEY JONES A diacumbellious linkumsloos  --  I hear tell , oh , I hear tell . COLIN SPENCE ( Angrily . ) Tchk ! ( Looking off up the hedge . ) S-sh  --  poor Ellen Jane again . TAPLEY JONES Unh-hunh . COLIN SPENCE Turning about in the road and looking off . Who does she want to see  --  always looking ? TAPLEY JONES Who do you reckon ? COLIN SPENCE Now she 's behind that tree . TAPLEY JONES ( Chuckling . ) Afraid of your face so beautiful , Mud fence trimmed in tar and set with speckled terrapins . A fuddy-duddy sours milk in the winter sun , My daddy said . She 's hiding from you . p. 18 COLIN SPENCE Oh yes , you 'd laugh and tell your joke . In the hush of death you 'd say your say . TAPLEY JONES ( Softly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oscar Graham . COLIN SPENCE And Mr. Graham 's no shining star for looks . It 's him she wants to see . TAPLEY JONES Oh , but he used to be , he used to be . No handsomer , Colin . When he dressed up and rared himself , Back behind his fast bay mare , he rared  --  With Ellen Jane a-setting at his side . Hyack ! All slashing fine and merry as birds they were . The people stopped their work to look at them , Brung their hoes up to the fence To see'em driving past  --  Tabooka  --  booka  --  book  --  They used to do that very thing  --  Go driving past . COLIN SPENCE Did ? TAPLEY JONES Yeh , did . COLIN SPENCE Why did n't they never marry then ? TAPLEY JONES Marrying ? ( Chuckling again . ) Goodness , his mind 's plumb full o ' marrying . ( Sneezing . ) Kerr-choo-ah ! COLIN SPENCE Mr. Graham 's got a fine wife  --  ( Hurriedly . ) Mis ' Julie 's the best there is ,  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but  --  ( Shaking his head . ) No , I do n't understand it . p. 19 TAPLEY JONES You ca n't work a puzzle , Lemme tell you one . Listen that the wind do n't hear  --  Mr. Graham willed one thing and God another . And all these years he 's fought against God 's will . And Ellen Jane was part of God 's great will . COLIN SPENCE ( Staring at him . ) Unh ? TAPLEY JONES ( Mockingly . ) Unh , he says . COLIN SPENCE Well , whatever it was It 's all done past And I reckon it 's passed away . ( Thinking . ) But it hurts her still whatever it is  --  She seems so pitiful  --  TAPLEY JONES Always such a lady of respect , she was , Except to one man , And he was all that counted to her soul . ( Leaning forward intently . ) And Oscar Graham is his name . COLIN SPENCE ( Quickly . ) No , you need n't tell me that . It ai n't my business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't my business . And I ai n't thinking of it . TAPLEY JONES It 's Lora Graham you 're thinking of ; That 's why I tell you  --  And she 's a-hunting Lora too , lately she is , For Lora 's her baby love , Like them two in the grave there . p. 20 COLIN SPENCE ( Disturbed . ) Here , here ! TAPLEY JONES ( Regaining his cryptic poise . ) All day you 've hinted round and round  --  Advice you want on Lora 's birthday  --  anh ? COLIN SPENCE ( Presently . ) Her birthday supper 's tonight . ( Taking a tiny box shyly from his pocket . ) I got her a ring . TAPLEY JONES ( Shortly . ) She wo n't wear it . COLIN SPENCE She will . TAPLEY JONES ( Sternly . ) She wo n't . COLIN SPENCE She might . TAPLEY JONES She wo n't . COLIN SPENCE Mr. Graham said she 'd take it . TAPLEY JONES But Ellen Jane says not to . ( Suddenly singing in a crooning , mocking voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh what a foolish fool he be , Oh what a foolish fool he be , To crave a girl that do n't crave he ! COLIN SPENCE ( Angrily . ) Make all the fun of me you want ! ( He returns the ring to his pocket. ) p. 21 TAPLEY JONES Listen there  --  first whippoorwill . ( In the pine forest the bird is heard calling . TAPLEY imitates it with trembling , whistling notes . ) White bowl o ' milk , White bowl o ' milk , Gals want candy And ca n't have silk . Roll over on your back three times , Colin , And you will have your wish . ( Whistling mockingly . ) Whippoorwill  --  whippoorwill , the bird of death , She will never love him . Never  --  never love him . COLIN SPENCE ( Muttering . ) Yah-yah . ( Looking off . ) There comes Mr. Graham . ( He picks up his tobacco plants and goes off at the left . TAPLEY stares after him , and then eyes the grave . ) ( Oscar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tall , rawboned farmer about fifty years old , straight as a stake and with something proud and untamed in his bearing . His face is thin and swarthy , and two restless black eyes , deep set in their sockets , stare out of it . He stops and watches TAPLEY , while a faint , writhing , embarrassed smile plays about his lips . ) OSCAR GRAHAM ( Quietly . ) Plants give out ? TAPLEY JONES ( Starting and pulling on his hat . ) We 're waiting for you to bring us some . Yes , sir . p. 22 OSCAR GRAHAM You and Colin go down to the bed and get enough to finish . Then come on home . TAPLEY JONES ( Moving off . ) Yessir . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Jerking his thumb behind him . ) Has Lora come by here ? TAPLEY JONES Not seen her , Mr. Graham . ( Graham stands staring at the ground as if pondering something . ) Maybe she passed when we were n't looking . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Tersely . ) I saw her down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say come home . It 's late , the bullbats soon 'll be braying loud . TAPLEY JONES Yessir . ( Tapley goes off at the left . GRAHAM stands looking at the grave . ELLEN JANE comes back along the road from the left , stops and peeps over the hedge at him . Presently he gives his head a short upward jerk and starts away at the left . She whistles to him from behind the hedge . ) ELLEN JANE Phwee-whoo ! OSCAR GRAHAM ( Stopping suddenly with his back to her . ) Ah  --  ELLEN JANE Phwee-whoo ! Please  --  please  --  please ! p. 23 OSCAR GRAHAM ( Looking around him quickly and speaking in a low voice as he moves over toward her . ) Go away from here as quick as you can . Leave me , leave ! ELLEN JANE I want to see Lora . I want to see her . OSCAR GRAHAM She 's not here . ELLEN JANE Here 's where her little shoe-track went in the sand . OSCAR GRAHAM She 's not here . I 've @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the plant bed . ( He makes a move as if to go away at the left . ) ELLEN JANE ( Calling to him . ) I ca n't go to the house to see Lora . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Stopping . ) My wife does n't care , Ellen Jane . ELLEN JANE Janey  --  Honey , Oscar . OSCAR GRAHAM You must go on home . ELLEN JANE Your wife hates my soul . ( Calling . ) Lor-a-a ! OSCAR GRAHAM ( Reaching over the hedge and touching her on the shoulder with his straight forefinger . ) Hush  --  hush ! p. 24 ELLEN JANE ( Shivering and twisting her hands . ) I know what 's in your mind  --  A ring  --  and Colin  --  and marrying . But Lora must n't marry Colin ever in this world . That would be a sin  --  Like your sin , but different , Oscar . Oh , oh ! OSCAR GRAHAM ( Muttering . ) Sin , sin  --  our double sin ! But now I hope to do God 's will . ELLEN JANE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God inside your heart Tore you from my claspy arms . Sin , Oscar , a sin ! God 's sin ! OSCAR GRAHAM Repentance , repentance , he says . ELLEN JANE Because I loved you so , I gave myself to you , And greedily you drank me in . My love was pure , for it was me  --  Shame ! Shame ! ( Singing . ) Oh love it is a bonny thing , It laughs and sings and cries , And like a tender flower in spring  --  ( Breaking off . ) Oscar , poor Oscar , keep well . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Loudly . ) Stop tormenting yourself !  --  ELLEN JANE You Oscar , you ! And where is Lora now ? ( Crying out . ) I 'm afraid for Lora. p. 25 OSCAR GRAHAM She 's been over to your house again , You filling her mind with lies . ELLEN JANE Stories , Oscar , beautiful stories . She came a-crying , her pretty cheeks all wet with tears . OSCAR GRAHAM But you wo n't trouble her long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the church . Tomorrow she 'll be married . Then she 'll be safe . ELLEN JANE ( Half-mockingly . ) Safe ? Hah , what 's in your heart , Oscar ? Look in there . ( Staring at him with wide , begging eyes . ) And I eased her crying , Oscar , I always ease it when she comes to me . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Suddenly and fiercely . ) Stay away from my child ! ELLEN JANE ( Almost whimpering . ) You said she could be mine too . That day you found me weeping under the white hawthorn bush . You said she could . OSCAR GRAHAM I was weak . ( Somewhat gently . ) Do n't worry now . Look  --  see how late it is ! The long tree shadows stretching in the field , Soon the night comes on  --  The whippoorwills are singing in the swamp . You do n't like the whippoorwills , Go home now , go home . p. 26 ELLEN JANE ( Gesturing toward the grave . ) Minna and Florie were once my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ clay . ( She moans and weaves her head jerkily about . ) OSCAR GRAHAM ( Loudly . ) And you it was that ruined them ! ( Gently , as he controls himself . ) But go on now . ELLEN JANE And they died  --  and they died , All on an April morning , Please  --  please let Lora be mine . OSCAR GRAHAM No ! ELLEN JANE Two days and she 's not been to see me , And I ca n't stand it  --  I  --  The clock ticks in the house so . OSCAR GRAHAM I know , I know . But go on , Ellen Jane . ELLEN JANE ( With a sort of moaning giggle . ) Bad Ellen Jane , bad Ellen Jane . The goats rear up to butt her in the road . Oscar , my love ,  --  ( Anguished . ) But I must see Lora . OSCAR GRAHAM I 'll call Tapley and get him to take you home . ELLEN JANE ( Terrified . ) No ! No ! Not him . His eyes look through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ELLEN JANE She must n't marry Colin . She 's pretty and he 's ugly . I had a dream ! ( Gazing at him intensely . ) I dreamed about Edward , Oscar . About our beautiful son , Edward . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Vehemently . ) He 's not our son . He 's Julie 's and mine . Born from lawful wedlock . And grown to live a curse to me and mine . ( Turning around helplessly . ) Tapley ! ELLEN JANE No . I 'm going , going .

He could not live without her.Fly eastward , turtledove , For westward flies my love.Sing  --  in the gray morningA pale horse was riding . ( Graham stands watching her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the distance and bubble across the scene. ) p. 28 OSCAR GRAHAM ( Raising his clenched fist above his head . ) God in Heaven , keep thy covenant and I 'll keep mine . In holy wedlock is no sin . ( Turning his face upward and letting his fist fall . ) My daughter shall be saved . Mercy , mercy , clean out my heart ! ( Turning , he strides off at the left . In a moment LORA comes through the hedge at the back . She is about seventeen years old , with a round babyish dolllike face , big-eyed and peacefully innocent . She carries an armful of wild flowers and love vines . Stepping by her side is TOMMY , a little coal-black Negro boy ten years old with bright animalish eyes and grinning white teeth . He holds a forked stick in his hand . ) TOMMY ( Plucking at LORA 'S dress and stopping . ) See kin we ketch him now . ( They creep softly forward . ) LORA GRAHAM Sh-h , there he is ! TOMMY Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He 's got a hole by the tombstone , And he goes down in it when he hears something . He sleeps in the grave at night , I betcha . ( He gently unlatches the gate to the little cemetery . ) LORA GRAHAM Maybe he 's a spirit that lives here , Guarding Minna and Florie. p. 29 TOMMY Nunh-unh . I betcha he 's a bad old man that 's turned to a snake . Shee-shee , I 'm not afraid of him . LORA GRAHAM I read in my book how snakes were spirits . They come and drink from a saucer of milk When the sun goes down . TOMMY Let me get my stick a-straddle his neck , We 'll put him in a cage for your birthday . ( He creeps through the gate , LORA following . As he raises his stick to dart forward , TAPLEY JONES ' hoarse voice calls from the fields . ) TAPLEY JONES Heigh , you ! TOMMY ( Stopping fearfully . ) That man again ! LORA GRAHAM ( Pointing to the grave . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ springs forward and jabs the fork of his stick sharply into the ground close by the tombstone . ) TOMMY ( Throwing down his stick  --  furiously . ) He 's gone in his hole . That man hollered and scared him . Shee-shee ! ( Turning he stares off at the right , his eyes glittering with hate , and his little fists see-sawing the air in fury . Then his mouth spreads into a grin , and thumbing his nose he hops over the fence and runs through the hedge and away at the left. ) p. 30 LORA GRAHAM Come back , Tommy ! ( TAPLEY and COLIN , bustling along the earth , come hurriedly in at the left . ) TAPLEY JONES He 'd better run or I 'd strap his noggin agin the ground And whang the life out'n him . ( COLIN stands watching LORA , his face full of love and tenderness , the hardness of his chin and mouth softening away . ) LORA GRAHAM ( Bending over the tombstone . ) There 's the hole where he 's hid . TAPLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch the little snake for me . TAPLEY JONES Unh , and some day that copperhead 'll bite Tommy , And that 'll be the end of him  --  the end , Dod-dum it ! LORA GRAHAM ( Sharply . ) No . TAPLEY JONES ( Sighing . ) He 'll swell up like a circus balloon and pop . LORA GRAHAM No ! TAPLEY JONES And his eyeballs turn green with pizen . ( Watching her . ) Your father said come home . p. 31 LORA GRAHAM ( Giggling . ) We heard him . Hid in the woods we were . ( Reciting . ) Ninny , ninny , nanny Say how much is many ? I wo n't go home till I 'm ready  --  ( The hoarse guttural notes of a faraway horn are heard now , running along the earth with a jarring sound .

( LORA arranges some little glass slippers and trinkets on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out through the gate and goes off at the right . COLIN starts after her when TAPLEY touches him on the arm . ) COLIN SPENCE Come on . TAPLEY JONES Fool , fool ! COLIN SPENCE Now what is it ? ( He stops and , sighing , looks after LORA . ) TAPLEY JONES And if that Tommy do n't quit hanging around Lora  --  ( Spitting . ) Ah , look in his eyes , he ai n't human . TOMMY ( Behind the hedge again . ) Shee-shee ! p. 32 TAPLEY JONES Heigh ! TOMMY ( Chuckling . ) Shee-shee ! ( He springs nimbly through the hedge once more and stands grinning at them . ) TAPLEY JONES ( Angrily . ) Go on away from here ! TOMMY ( Mocking him . ) Go on away from here !

You ca n't ketch me  --  shee-shee  --  old bad man ! ( He runs away at the left , barking and giggling with laughter . ) TAPLEY JONES ( Growling . ) Now you see . COLIN SPENCE I do n't see . TAPLEY JONES Fool , that 's what  --  he 's laughing at us . Deep in his little black heart he knows something . ( Loudly . ) Something , I tell you ! p. 33 COLIN SPENCE ( Looking at him perplexed . ) Hanh ? ( TAPLEY stares at him and COLIN returns his stare . ) TAPLEY JONES Something bad . Ho-ho  --  see the meaning in my eyes ? COLIN SPENCE ( Softly . ) You act funny . TAPLEY JONES Me ? COLIN SPENCE ( Angrily . ) Like somebody not right . ( Roughly . ) Like Ellen Jane  --  a screw loose . TAPLEY JONES ( Astounded . ) What you saying ? COLIN SPENCE Well , why you keep hinting at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ starts off . ) TAPLEY JONES Colin . ( COLIN stops again . ) You did n't see what I saw awhile ago , did you ? COLIN SPENCE What ? TAPLEY JONES Ellen Jane was talking here to Mr. Graham , And he run her off . COLIN SPENCE ( Looking after her . ) I do n't care now . Let him run her off . She ai n't right in her head . I do n't care . p. 34 TAPLEY JONES ( Touching him on the shoulder . ) I ai n't talking . Listen now , I ai n't talking about nobody . For a shet mouth catches no flies , And a long tongue is a hangman 's rope . If Mr. Graham ever asks you , Remember , I ai n't been talking . And I 'm going to tell you something . ( He hesitates . ) COLIN SPENCE ( Suddenly shouting . ) Tell it then ! TAPLEY JONES Ellen Jane loves Oscar Graham . COLIN SPENCE Suppose she does  --  that 's not news . TAPLEY JONES Always has . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fool  --  fool , he was To trample the flower of love to serve his God , And God cursed him and spet in his face , And then he spet back in God 's  --  Not that I can do a thing about it , But I can see , And that 's how it is . COLIN SPENCE ( Uncertainly . ) Yeh , yeh . TAPLEY JONES And he did n't marry Ellen Jane . It ruined her life , her mind comes and goes . And they wa n't no woman sweet like her . I knowed her as a child , And her brown braids running in the wind . COLIN SPENCE All right , all right . p. 35 TAPLEY JONES Them two in the grave there used to slip to her house And stay by the hour , And she 'd tell'em her wild stories  --  And give ' em flower bouquets to wear on their bosoms . She 's told Lora stories like that .  --  Now you see . COLIN SPENCE I do n't see . Foolish . ( Spitting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't like you . You ai n't purty to look at . Purty , purty is what she likes . Always purty , purty for all of them  --  Children , I mean .

COLIN SPENCE That 's enough  --  you and your whispers . TAPLEY JONES Onct he come along the road dressed like a peddler , Had a budget on his back all-pretending . Fooled us all . ( Suddenly . ) You leave Lora alone , that 's what I mean . And that 's what Ellen Jane means , Loony and hog-wild though she be . COLIN SPENCE And that 's your advice ? Clear as muddy water . TAPLEY JONES The Grahams are proud folks and stick together , Close as bees in the honeycomb they stick . You let ' em be . p. 36 COLIN SPENCE Yeh . TAPLEY JONES Mr. Graham 's willing  --  hanh ! And wants you for a son-in-law ; All safe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yeh , that 's right he does . And I 'm proud he wants it so . TAPLEY JONES And why does he want it so ?

COLIN SPENCE Scared ! Lord God , of what ? TAPLEY JONES Scared , and he wants her safe  --  Wants Lora safe and sound . You 've heard whispers . COLIN SPENCE ( Uncertainly . ) Nothing but whispers . TAPLEY JONES Whispers about these Grahams , you have . And you 're fixing trouble for yourself . ( His head moves more swiftly up and down . ) COLIN SPENCE ( Pondering . ) It 'll be my trouble . TAPLEY JONES Mr. Graham 's worried about Lora . That 's why he wants you to marry her . ( Gesturing at the grave again . ) You know what happened to them two there ? p. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drowned seven years ago . TAPLEY JONES ( Scornfully . ) Hunh ! Yes , whispers , Something worrying Mr. Graham to death . While ago he wanted to know where she was . Uneasy about her , Colin . Something 's worrying him . COLIN SPENCE ( A smile of pleasure running over his face . ) And I 'll be able to watch over Lora , I 'll love her always and take care of her . And there 'll be no worry about her any more . TAPLEY JONES ( Disgusted . ) Poor fellow ! COLIN SPENCE ( In sudden anger . ) Well , what'n the name of Jesus Christ you mean ? Tell me what you mean ! TAPLEY JONES ( Closing up like a clam . ) I ca n't tell you , for I do n't know . People have asked me , but I 'd never say a word , Not a mumbling single word . COLIN SPENCE They 're better'n other folks , and folks do n't like it . The Grahams are better'n other folks . And people whisper . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . ) TAPLEY JONES ( After a moment  --  placatingly . ) We 've worked a lot together in the field , Ai n't we , Colin ? p. 38 COLIN SPENCE ( Grudgingly . ) Yeh , a heap . TAPLEY JONES Sorter like partners , ai n't we ? COLIN SPENCE I reckon so . TAPLEY JONES And I sorter like you . Do n't you me ? COLIN SPENCE Oh , yeh  --  yeh , I do . But sometimes when  --  TAPLEY JONES But sometimes when I 'm strange  --  COLIN SPENCE Yeh , quare and strange  --  TAPLEY JONES But never as strange as life , Colin  --  Never as quare as that  --  Listen , Colin , I got your interest in my heart . ( Sharply . ) Let Lora Graham go her way and you go yours ! I keep telling you ! COLIN SPENCE Why do n't you leave the Grahams then ? TAPLEY JONES I 'm too old .  --  It do n't matter about me . And I ai n't trying to marry none of ' em , Hee-hee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hush , I tell you ! You hear that ! ( Shouting again . ) And you need n't come to the wedding ! ( He turns and hurries away at the right . Old TAPLEY looks after him , sighing and swaying his shoulders. ) p. 39 TAPLEY JONES Ahm  --  Ahm  --  TOMMY ( Behind the hedge . ) Shee-shee . TAPLEY JONES ( Roaring . ) Scat from here ! TOMMY Shee-shee . TAPLEY JONES ( Looking around for something to throw at him . ) Little old black crow ! TOMMY Here come a rock . ( He throws a stone at TAPLEY and hits him full in the stomach . ) TAPLEY JONES ( Doubling up , and then controlling his fury and calling in a sudden , kind voice . ) TOMMY TOMMY ( Poking his head carefully through the hedge and grinning at him . ) Yessir . TAPLEY JONES You must n't ever throw rocks at an old man . TOMMY I hit you right plumb in the belly  --  shee-shee . TAPLEY JONES Why you hang around Miss Lora so much ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look after the little girls ' grave . Miss Lora says watch over the grave . p. 40 TAPLEY JONES I 'll get you some candy someday . TOMMY Bring me three lemon sticks  --  will you ? TAPLEY JONES You must be a good little boy . TOMMY And some dog tallow to chew  --  Yessir , I 'll be good as gold . TAPLEY JONES Are you a good little boy ? TOMMY ( Grinning . ) Yessir . TAPLEY JONES And you never do dirty , bad things ? TOMMY ( Licking out his tongue in a curl . ) No , sir . TAPLEY JONES And Miss Lora 's a good little girl ? TOMMY Yessir . Good lak the angels with purty wings . Bofe of us is . ( He closes his eyes and stretches his mouth in a wide laugh . ) TAPLEY JONES ( Yelling . ) Go away from here , you devil ! ( He turns and waddles off at the right . TOMMY runs through the hedge and flops his arms after him , crowing like a rooster and bowing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the tombstone and begins prying behind it with a stick. ) p. 41 TOMMY Come out of there . ( LORA creeps up behind the hedge from the right . ) LORA GRAHAM ( Whistling softly like ELLEN JANE . ) Phwee-whoo ! I slipped around and came back . TOMMY ( Grinning . ) There you is , Lora . LORA GRAHAM ( Coming through the hedge . ) Help me fix the flowers nice . ( She and TOMMY begin arranging the flowers on the grave . ) TOMMY That old man wants to hurt me . LORA GRAHAM He wo n't hurt you . ( The jarring supper horn blows again . ) TOMMY ( Aghast . ) Listen there , they 're blowing for you . ( GRAHAM comes suddenly in from the left . LORA springs up in fright . ) OSCAR GRAHAM Calling to supper across the fields , come ! ( A kind of excitement is frothing in him , but he controls it . He gestures and LORA follows docilely as a dog . They go away along the hedge at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the dirt and after a moment whirls about and runs away up the hedge to the left . By this time the sun has gone down and a gray misty twilight has spread over the fields . Along the road from the right comes a longhorned , rawbony old steer drawing a buggy-wheeled cart with MACK the Negro sitting in it asleep. ) p. 42 MACK ( Muttering in his dreams . ) Gid-up-gid-up-gid-up . The thick fat 's biled away . Gid-up-gid-up , and where 's my share ? The cat 's got it ? Where 's the cat ? Rope hung him  --  Where 's the rope ? Knife cut it  --  gid-up ! TOMMY ( Running down the road after the cart  --  gleefully . ) There you is , Pappy , drunk again ! ( He hops up on the cart , jiggling his cupped hands in the air before him . ) Heavy , heavy , heavy , hangs over yo ' haid ! MACK ( Still muttering in his sleep . ) Layovers for meddlers , Crutches for lame ducks . Gid-up  --  gid-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( The cart passes on up the road . ELLEN JANE emerges from the forest at the rear and , passing through the hedge , enters the little plot and stands by the grave . ) ELLEN JANE ( Babbling softly in the twilight . ) This is the lady 's forks and knives . And that 's the lady 's table  --  Children , come and get your milk Quick as you are able . ( She gazes about her and then sits down on the ground , humming her lullaby . She opens the bosom of her dress . The sounds of the countryside at evening time float across the scene . The scene fades out. ) @x It is night , half an hour later , and darkness is enveloping OSCAR GRAHAM 'S low farmhouse , set like a shadowy dot in the middle of his fields . To the north , the tongue of Charles ' wain is reared up high in the sky , and across the darkening land below , the highway runs like a strip of gossamer gray ribbon . A little lane leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and by a path around the corner of the house , one comes into a little bare yard before a stooped porch and sees beyond it LORA GRAHAM , now wearing a pink ribbon in her hair , and JULIE , her gaunt , flat-chested mother , arranging supper in the dining room . From a stove at the back they bring dishes and set them on a table where two tall red candles stand up straight and unlighted waiting for a match . A burning kerosene lamp sits on the mantelpiece above a squat and smoky fireplace at the left . Out of LORA 'S tinted hazel eyes , as she talks with her mother , comes no look other than that of sweet affection and innocence . As for JULIE , the swirl of life 's funneled events has played fiercely above her head and left her with an Indian masklike face . Out of her hollow eyes as she murmurs a casual assent to LORA 'S words there comes no look save that of cold and cryptic understanding . LORA GRAHAM ( Bending over and sniffing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you make such cakes , Mother ? Never could I cook so . I could never cook like that . p. 44 JULIE GRAHAM ( At the stove . ) Yes . LORA GRAHAM I could n't . JULIE GRAHAM ( After a moment  --  indicating the cake . ) Spread the icing on it . LORA GRAHAM Nice and thin as a sheet of paper . ( Turning to a mirror that hangs on the back wall . ) How do I look now , Mother ? ( She stares with a mixture of mockery and childish inquisitiveness at her image in the mirror . ) JULIE GRAHAM ( With a queer sort of sound in her voice . ) Do you like yourself so much ? LORA GRAHAM ( Turning and putting her arms around her . ) Mother , dear Mother , I like you most . ( Half-chanting . ) Better than honey dew at day  --  Better than cherries on the fence , Or honey in the comb . JULIE GRAHAM Tchk ! ( Pushing by her and setting a dish on the table . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spreading the icing on the cake . ) LORA GRAHAM I 'm so happy . Are you happy , Mother ? p. 45 JULIE GRAHAM I 'm happy . LORA GRAHAM I want to sing and dance and run  --  ( Abruptly . ) Why do n't you ever smile , Mother ?  --  Even a little teeny smile ? JULIE GRAHAM ( Coldly as always . ) Old people do n't have to smile . LORA GRAHAM You 're not old , Mother , but you seem old . May I put the candles on now ? ( Receiving no answer , she begins placing tiny candles on the cake , and counting the while , looking at them and murmuring in a childlike sing-song way . ) Fifteen  --  sixteen  --  fifteen  --  sixteen . ( Breathlessly . ) Seventeen . JULIE GRAHAM ( Colorlessly . ) Eighteen , nineteen  --  LORA GRAHAM That 's so far away . JULIE GRAHAM Not far . LORA GRAHAM How far ? JULIE GRAHAM Not far . LORA GRAHAM How far 's it to Molly Bright ? Threescore and ten . Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room . ) Yes , if your legs are strong . And the old witch do n't  --  p. 46 JULIE GRAHAM ( Reprovingly . ) Lora ! LORA GRAHAM Sha n't I smile when I get old , Mother ? JULIE GRAHAM Maybe . LORA GRAHAM Lots of old people do . I 've seen ' em at Little Bethel church . They had religion and their faces shone with a light . JULIE GRAHAM Never mind now . LORA GRAHAM The day I 'm twenty-one I know I 'll wake up laughing . I want to tell you something . I had a dream last night . I 'll have to tell Tapley about it . He 'll interpret what it means . JULIE GRAHAM ( Abruptly . ) No . LORA GRAHAM Why not ? JULIE GRAHAM Well , what did you dream ? LORA GRAHAM I dreamed about Jesus and  --  JULIE GRAHAM Because you professed him in the church last Sunday . Your father 's glad you gave your little heart to God . LORA GRAHAM But Father does n't like God . JULIE GRAHAM @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's glad you 're saved . p. 47 LORA GRAHAM And are you glad , Mother ? JULIE GRAHAM I 'm glad . LORA GRAHAM ( With dreamy introspection . ) I gave my heart to Jesus and not to God . Last night I dreamed of somebody like Jesus . JULIE GRAHAM ( Her hands taking a dish over to the stove . ) Supper 's cooked now . LORA GRAHAM I dreamed about Brother . JULIE GRAHAM ( Quickly . ) La , and you got on your new slippers ! LORA GRAHAM ( Sticking out her feet and pulling back her dress . ) Look how shiny they are with lamp black  --  I rubbed them so with the green flannel . ( Watching her mother . ) Well  --  I dreamed about his picture . JULIE GRAHAM ( Her figure showing a faint agitation , though her face remains masklike and set in the same gray . ) It 's put away to keep it . LORA GRAHAM ( In a small metallic voice . ) No , Mother , to hide it . I found it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a photograph and stares at it . ) Brother , dear Brother , where are you tonight ? And this is my birthday . I 'd be here for yours . p. 48 JULIE GRAHAM ( Swiftly . ) Give it to me . LORA GRAHAM ( Turning away from her reach and continuing to gaze at it . ) And in my dream I saw where you had hid it  --  There among the land deeds at the bottom of the trunk . And there I found it , All wrapped in tissue paper . JULIE GRAHAM ( Suddenly clasping her hands across the middle of her body . ) Put it back ! LORA GRAHAM Give it to me for a birthday present . Please , Mother , please . JULIE GRAHAM No . LORA GRAHAM Please , Mother . JULIE GRAHAM ( Sternly . ) Give it to me ! LORA GRAHAM ( Handing it to her , her lips trembling . ) I would n't hurt it . ( Julie takes it , and without looking at it goes into the room at the left and secretes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there , revealing her action . She stands in the middle of the room staring up at a crayon portrait of two beautiful young girls that hangs on the wall . LORA calls to her with a sudden and quick archfulness . ) I 'm not a baby , Mother . I 'm a woman now . Does n't today make me all grown up ? Seventeen . ( Julie makes no reply . ) Now I must let down my dress and do up my hair . This morning when the rooster was crowing for day , I heard Father say , " She 's a woman now . " What did he mean , Mother ? ( Julie lifts her head up straight at LORA 's words . LORA continues in her cool , childish voice , the syllables trickling through the open door . ) Why did he do that , Mother ? He did n't know I was awake . But I was listening to the rooster crow , And I thought to myself , That 's the way the rooster crowed about poor Jesus  --  I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And I wanted to talk to him about his soul And get him to be saved in church like you and me . But I was afraid . ( Colin comes up into the yard out of the gloom , with little Negro TOMMY hopping along silently some distance behind him . He stops still and stares at LORA in the house by the table . His eyes catch sight of JULIE in the room at the left , and averting his face he goes quickly up and out on the porch . TOMMY hops up and down in the yard , holding his two clasped hands above him and shaking them like a gambler 's dice box as he gives a calling whistle through his teeth . LORA comes running out on the porch in a patter of slippered feet . ) Hey  --  Oh , Tom  --  mee ! There you are , like sand burning your toes . ( She pays no attention to COLIN , who stands at the shelf washing his hands. ) p. 49 TOMMY ( His white teeth and roving eyes shining out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you  --  shee  --  shee ! LORA GRAHAM ( Eagerly . ) You caught him . TOMMY Nanh-yuh . I 'll dig him out'n his hole tonight . With a torch of six fat splinters full of pitch I 'll dig . LORA GRAHAM ( Petulantly . ) You said you 'd catch him for my birthday . TOMMY ( Now beginning to hop up and down again with his teasing . ) Shee-shee  --  he 's deep under the stone . I prized for him ag'in with a stick and I dug up these . ( He comes up to LORA and hands her five little white stones . ) LORA GRAHAM Oh , pritty , pritty ! Jack rocks ! TOMMY ( Hopping up on the porch where the light streams out from the dining room , and squatting down before her . ) Chickens in the coop quicker'n you ! LORA GRAHAM ( Dropping to her knees before him . ) No sirree . ( Counting out . ) Eeny-meeny-tipsy-teenie , Apple Jack and Josephiny . Have a peach , have a plum , Have a stick of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Y-e-s spells out and out goes you . ( She is " it , " and they begin playing the game of jackstones . COLIN dashes the water from his pan out into the yard and stands gazing up toward the great dipper in the north . ) COLIN SPENCE ( In a muffled voice . ) Happy birthday , Lora ! TOMMY Gim me a towel to spread down ! ( He jerks a towel from a nail on the post near by , spreads it down , and he and LORA go on playing . COLIN wipes his dripping wet hands on his trousers . ) LORA GRAHAM Now , fourits ! TOMMY Hee-hee-hee . But wait till I feed the elevint . ( With a sigh COLIN takes the milk bucket and goes into the room where JULIE is now sitting , bent over in a chair . ) COLIN SPENCE ( To JULIE . ) I smell your bread a-burning . ( JULIE starts up and returns to her kitchen work at the stove . The light fades from the room at the left . COLIN jerks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the fields . p. 51 JULIE GRAHAM ( Dully . ) I know . I know ! LORA GRAHAM ( Rebelliously . ) You always beat me , Tommy ! TOMMY ( Gleefully . ) I always does  --  Shee-shee ! JULIE GRAHAM ( Eyeing her bread at the stove . ) Go on home , Tommy . LORA GRAHAM ( Softly . ) Do n't go yet . JULIE GRAHAM Go home , Tommy ! TOMMY Yes 'm , yes 'm . ( He springs off the porch with a whoop and runs jiggling around in the yard a moment barking at them , then darts away in the gloom . ) COLIN SPENCE ( As if speaking to the candles on the table . ) I told her happy birthday ! ( Calling again . ) Happy birthday , Lora ! LORA GRAHAM I heard you , Colin . COLIN SPENCE Yes , yes . ( Trying to hide his confusion and pain as he comes out onto the porch again . ) I 'll milk the cow now and be back soon . ( He steps down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ LORA leaves the towel and jackstones lying on the floor and stands looking out the way TOMMY went . TAPLEY JONES enters slow and work-bent from the right and sits quietly down on the edge of the porch , moving his head up and down. ) p. 52 JULIE GRAHAM ( From the kitchen . ) You , Tapley ? TAPLEY JONES Yes 'm . JULIE GRAHAM ( In a suddenly friendly voice . ) I 've got you something good to eat . TAPLEY JONES Thankee , Julie . LORA GRAHAM ( Gaily . ) As I was walking through the wheat , I picked up something good to eat , Neither fish , flesh , fowl nor bone  --  I kept it till it walked alone . Guess . TAPLEY JONES ( Sharply . ) I do n't want to guess . LORA GRAHAM You could n't  --  it 's an egg . Tommy told me . ( Tapley is silent . LORA begins looking up at the sky . ) TAPLEY JONES What you see up there ? LORA GRAHAM Mr. Marshburn said look up at the firmament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . TAPLEY JONES You can see Old Master 's handiwork up there . LORA GRAHAM Did n't Jesus make the stars ? TAPLEY JONES No , God made ' em . p. 53 LORA GRAHAM I believe Jesus did . TAPLEY JONES Why ? LORA GRAHAM He 's beautiful , and the stars are beautiful . Beautiful people make beautiful things . TAPLEY JONES ( With a touch of surliness . ) Ai n't God beautiful ? LORA GRAHAM No  --  he 's ugly with his beard . I saw his picture in a book . JULIE GRAHAM ( Shortly . ) Supper 'll be ready soon . TAPLEY JONES Ah . LORA GRAHAM How old are you , Tapley ? TAPLEY JONES Seventy-four , going on seventy-five . Happy birthday ! ( With sudden jollity . ) Got many presents ? LORA GRAHAM No . TAPLEY JONES Would a-give you one but the long green was short . ( Yawning . ) Ha-ha . LORA GRAHAM Tommy brought me a present . ( Tapley suddenly cuts off his yawn and is silent . LORA call out . ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , tobacco worms and purty girls like you . p. 54 LORA GRAHAM You do n't like poor little Tommy . TAPLEY JONES Who says I do n't like poor little Tommy ? ( Murmuring . ) Tom-cat  --  Tom-cat . LORA GRAHAM You do n't know everything . Tommy 's cute . TAPLEY JONES Well , now that 's nice . ( With quiet inquisitiveness . ) What makes him cute ? LORA GRAHAM ( Watching TAPLEY . ) Is that milky way really a milky way ? TAPLEY JONES It 's a lot of stars all close together . ( With a sudden quickening of his voice . ) God sprinkled ' em up there . ( Stretching his lumpy arms over his head . ) With his great hand he sowed ' em Like daisies in a field , And they blossom forever There on high .

( Showing his teeth . ) Shee-shee  --  TAPLEY JONES ( Angrily . ) Ah ! ( He seizes a dipper of water from the pail and dashes it at TOMMY , who steps aside and runs away , laughing in the darkness . ) LORA GRAHAM ( Angrily springing to her feet . ) You always treat him mean . TAPLEY JONES When I lay hands on him , He 'll quit that mommicking about , Aye , I 'll rap on his ding-dong , Till it 's red as a beet  --  No , black as a huckleberry . ( Sputtering as he picks the towel up from the floor and mops his face with it . ) You children , you children ! ( With a growl he sits down on the edge of the porch again and says no more . Now and then he lets out a deep grunt . ) LORA GRAHAM ( Presently . ) Why do you groan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ! LORA GRAHAM ( Snickering teasingly . ) You who ?

GRAHAM speaks suddenly and jerkily . ) Everybody bow his head in silent thanksgiving unto God . ( A tremor of surprise passes through the room , but heads are bowed , COLIN , who stands in the doorway , doing likewise . Presently GRAHAM looks up as a signal the prayer is over , and those at the table begin eating . COLIN and JULIE seat themselves among them . They pass the food along , each eating according to his own hunger  --  LORA little or nothing , JULIE and GRAHAM little . But TAPLEY eats in huge mouthfuls as if he would swallow up both the world 's food and its troubles . COLIN attacks his plate doggedly , his eyes lowered in unhappy consciousness of LORA 's antagonism to him . GRAHAM stares fixedly at LORA , and she gradually bows her head before his intense gaze . Slowly everyone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the Scotchman 's lips , and they all sit waiting uneasily .

I would stand to myself  --  Until proof of his kindness and mercy came to me . LORA GRAHAM ( Whispering tremulously . ) Father !

And now  --  this night  --  I make a new covenant with him , And agree to serve him . p. 62 LORA GRAHAM ( Springing up and kissing him . ) I 'm so glad !

COLIN SPENCE ( Inaudibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ OSCAR GRAHAM ( Mumbling . ) At this hour seventeen years ago she was born . ( He picks up his knife and fork as if dismissing the subject .

Now that you confess the sweet Lord Jesus And say you 'll serve Him . OSCAR GRAHAM ( To JULIE . ) We 'll forget the past , And when Lora and Colin sit around us as one , A new life begins .

It looked dry , did n't it , Colin ? Sun setting red , Fair weather ahead . OSCAR GRAHAM ( To JULIE . ) It 's all fixed for Colin and Lora to marry . I know you 're glad . JULIE GRAHAM Yes .

LORA GRAHAM ( Listening , her face alight with interest . ) Like something in the sky it seems  --  music . ( She passes by COLIN 'S outstretched hand and moves out on the porch , as a bent old man , dressed in a long ragged cape and tattered hat , comes creeping forlornly around the corner of the house . He stands playing an accordion , which he holds half-hid in the folds of his cape and beneath his thick , cottony beard . As he stares up at LORA , his fingers gradually stop their playing . ) OSCAR GRAHAM ( Calling sharply from within . ) Who 's that ?

( Hastily . ) You better , Colin , With lungs like a bat  --  leather bellows  --  Then not a one would be left burning , And your wish is near to hand .

OLD MAN I play for music  --  Making music from my own heart-strings . COLIN SPENCE Ho-ho ! Smart he is , And quick as an adder . LORA GRAHAM I 've got some pennies in my bank .

OLD MAN Something like winter and summer together in it , mixed with flowers might it be . LORA GRAHAM Your words are beautiful . ( Gaily . ) I never thought of that .

But ever and anon he cuts a quick look from under his shaggy eyebrows at LORA 'S blissful , listening face . LORA speaks softly . ) Beautiful , beautiful music too .

In the room at the left LORA dons her nightgown and resumes her reading . Silence comes over the scene .

Thou hast tried me mightily , but I will complain no more  --  ( The OLD MAN begins playing his accordion as if addressing the house with a sleepy serenade . As the notes wander out across the night , the sounds in the house gradually die away and the lights fade out . Only the silvery glow of the rising moon illuminates the scene . ) OLD MAN Peace , peace to you all , I pray your God . ( Sighing , he returns to the outhouse and lays himself down on his bed . Presently TOMMY comes running up into the yard from the night . He carries a small sack held carefully out in his hand . ) TOMMY Shee-shee . ( He listens but no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !

Presently a will-o-the-wisp light appears at the edge of the yard , and two little girls about fifteen years old , in their heavenly masks resembling LORA , float across the scene toward the OLD MAN 'S bed . Their garments are long and trailing as if love-vines and honeysuckle flowers were clinging to them , and their movements are enmeshed in the tempo of the whippoorwill 's calling . The illumination that surrounds them lights up the OLD MAN 'S face and he is no longer an OLD MAN but a beautiful youth of twentyfour or five with hair curly and yellow like LORA 'S . In his sleep his old man 's beard and snow-white hair have fallen aside . The little girls stare at him , their slender bodies flickering like a flame in the wind .

TAPLEY JONES ( Lightly . ) Out there in the woods picking vi'lets . Hear her singing ? OSCAR GRAHAM Aye .

OSCAR GRAHAM Still they were evil folks in them days , Fighting and cutting each other and breaking the law .

Grandmuh herself knew it all by heart , more than twenty verses . And all because they accused him of stealing a mare .

( But he stands looking anxiously toward the woods . ) OSCAR GRAHAM You can tell the meaning of dreams , Tapley , I know that . Last night I dreamt that same dream . I came along near the house and the house was all black . A woman was standing before it , With her head hid under a big black bonnet . Then I heard Lora wailing inside the house . And away off in the woods I heard them two , ( Throwing out his hand toward the grave . ) My little dead daughters . Calling so lonesome it 'd eat your heart out . I asked the black woman what she was doing . But she would n't say a word . Just stood there high as a stake . And I heard the sparrows talking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whispering And looking at me with their big queer eyes , And they were sorry about something going to happen . I heard ' em say so , Tapley , Seemed like I heard ' em say it . ( He shudders and turns away his head. ) p. 106 TAPLEY JONES ( With conscious wonder . ) A dream  --  OSCAR GRAHAM ( His voice going on in rhythmic and harassed recitation . ) It scares me to think of it  --  Scares me to death nearly . In the yard everything was dark , like the eclipse . The cow was lowing away off and the sound seemed to run across the sky Like Julie 's dinner horn . It died away , And I heard my daddy calling the hogs , Up at the mulberry orchard the way he used to . Every time he called , A kind of jarring run right through me into the ground . Then Florie and Minna begun to call the hogs with him . They 'd call the little ones , And he 'd call the big ones . And I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , Oscar ? " He would say that , And they 'd say to me , " Father , Father , Come get us out from under this big clayroot . We 're stifling to death in the dirt . " And all of a sudden my daddy hollered to me To let him come home , And set down in his chair at the table , And eat some roast'n ears . He was a great hand for young corn . I was scared and called back , And told him not to come . And Lora leaned out of the window And begged me to make Florie and Minna go back to their grave . " Make ' em go back , make ' em go back ! " She 'd say . And I looked at that thin woman in the yard , And she turned and went up the road To run ' em back in their grave . Then I knew it was Ellen Jane had been standing there . But the back of her head looked like Julie 's face mask . Then come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she put ' em back in the ground . All of a sudden I heard Lora screaming around the house . I run and met her , And somebody was walking behind her smiling , His lips pulled back from his teeth like my Joe dog . Who was it ? I know who it was . ( Beating his hands together . ) And where is he now , Tapley ? Where is he ? ( Controlling his emotion . ) I woke up and it was day . And then I went to the preacher this morning And asked him to come and marry her and Colin , And he do n't want to do it . You know why ? ( Fiercely . ) Because he loves her himself . Everybody loves Lora . ( Whispering . ) Everybody . p. 107 TAPLEY JONES ( Cunningly . ) Everybody ? OSCAR GRAHAM Hanh ? TAPLEY JONES Everybody ? OSCAR GRAHAM But he 's coming just the same . I made him come . ( Rocking his head . ) What does it mean , Tapley ? TAPLEY JONES @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dream . OSCAR GRAHAM Seven years ago I had a dream like that  --  The night before it happened . You told me trouble would come . TAPLEY JONES ( Gently . ) You 've had all the trouble can come . And you just happened to dream , That 's all . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Turning on him angrily . ) You know . ( Gripping him fiercely by the shoulder . ) Tell me . TAPLEY JONES ( Foolishly . ) It was her birthday made you think of it all . Your change in religion , too . Do n't let it worry you . OSCAR GRAHAM Last night I almost felt safe . The future had pleasure in it . That dream drove it all away . Woe , woe , Tapley , I bear it ! Ah , listen to her singing there . Aye , happy and good  --  Happy and good she is . Colin , ye 'll never find a better one than her .

Keep her close to you . ( Fiercely . ) Keep her from everybody . COLIN SPENCE ( Firmly . ) Yessir . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Calling . ) Come here a minute , will ye , Lora ! ( She answers in the distance , and GRAHAM moves toward the hedge at the back and looks out at the forest . ) TAPLEY JONES ( Softly as he wags his head . ) The day has gone down again fair as a bell . COLIN SPENCE ( Mumbling . ) And we need rain on the plants to make ' em live . p. 109 TAPLEY @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is seen entering the road from the forest . She stands looking at the scene before her a moment with thoughtful face , and then comes on through the hedge , carrying an armful of dogwood sprays and wild flowers . She has woven a love vine in her hair . She looks rebelliously at COLIN and edges around him to stand near her father . ) LORA GRAHAM ( Gently . ) What is it , Father ? ( Starting . ) What 's the matter ? OSCAR GRAHAM Lora , take those flowers out'n your hair . LORA GRAHAM I just  --  OSCAR GRAHAM You were saved in the church And put away vanity , vanity . LORA GRAHAM And I prayed for you , Father , Every night I did till you were saved . OSCAR GRAHAM ( Pointing to her hair . ) And the Good Book says  --  LORA GRAHAM ( Removing the vine . ) Vanity  --  OSCAR GRAHAM Vanity of vanities saith the preacher . You 're one of the redeemed now . LORA GRAHAM Yes , yes , And you too , Father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decorate and make ye pretty , Leave ' em alone , leave ' em all alone . Put not your heart in that . LORA GRAHAM ( Childishly . ) Put it in Jesus . OSCAR GRAHAM In Jesus . He will save ye and protect you from the adversary , Him who seeketh to waylay and destroy . LORA GRAHAM He is my hope and salvation . OSCAR GRAHAM And all things of this world are vanity and vexation of spirit . LORA GRAHAM ( With a sudden sunshiny smile . ) All is vanity . OSCAR GRAHAM Like the wind , aye , like man 's poor life , ( A smile hovering on his tortured lips . ) Whirling about continually , no rest , no peace . LORA GRAHAM In the grave whither thou goest . OSCAR GRAHAM Amen . ( They stand a moment silent . TAPLEY and COLIN move around in embarrassment . ) LORA GRAHAM What is it , Father ? OSCAR GRAHAM ( Tearfully . ) Ye 're so good , Lora . Ye are good , ai n't ye , child ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GRAHAM ( Sternly . ) Lora , do you feel saved and consecrated ?  --  This minute in your little breast  --  Your little heart , I mean .

LORA GRAHAM ( Putting her hand on her breast , her lips trembling . ) I vow , I vow ! OSCAR GRAHAM And you will serve the Lord with all your mind , soul and strength ?

Out of the forest at the rear the OLD MAN steps with his accordion , and puts himself at the head , playing the funeral lament .

The scene fades out. ) @x Afternoon the next @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flag and with its two ends resting on chairs , is placed in the center of the Graham yard . On either side of it stand four soldiers , a corporal and his honor guard , one of the number carrying a trap drum , another a bugle . The others hold rifles at their sides in stiff attention . Behind the soldiers is grouped a country chorus , to the left of which are a number of women and children and to the right a number of men . COLIN and TAPLEY , dressed in their Sunday clothes , stand apart at the outer edge of the latter group . Mr. MARSHBURN , the gentle , youthful preacher , stands on the porch with an open Bible in his hand . GRAHAM and his wife , dressed in heavy mourning , sit on the right . LORA , dressed in black , sits at the left , her head slightly bent and a white flower at her breast . Her masklike face is that of a full-grown woman now , marked with years of grief . Her eyes are sick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pasty like the flesh of a woods mushroom . Her hands , holding a little handkerchief , lie cold and still in her lap . MR . MARSHBURN ( Continuing his service for the dead . ) We see the morning and the evening go by . The trees and plants around us bloom and fade , And the life of spring brings us the tragedy Of this young man 's passing away . The old man like a ripening apple Fulfills his season , Lives out his years , And goes to his everlasting home . But this young man was cut down In the spice of his days , In the very budding of his spring . Ere the evil days were come When he would say " I have no pleasure in them "  --  Cut down without knowing what it is to live . To love , to be  --  To the sweet and peaceful setting of the sun  --  ( His voice chokes , and with a spotless white handkerchief he wipes away a tear . As he reads there is silent respect and here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words . ) The atheist and the infidel say , " Yes , there is no God , and there is no hope . A man is no more than a flower , A homeless bird that 's tossed aloft  --  A beast of the field led to slaughter , A leaf flickering down under the winter sleet . " ( Laying his hand reverently on the Bible . ) But blessed be the name of the Lord , We have a hope . Let the days and seasons change , Let man 's poor life be forfeit in its bud , Still we have a hope in the Word . ( His voice rising stronger . ) It says all things are possible with God . His ways are strange and different from our ways And everything works for the good of those Who love Him in their hearts . ( During the reading of the last words , ELLEN JANE has come slowly in from the left . As the neighbors almost unawarely move aside for her , she goes up on the porch and stands beside LORA , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at one another uncertainly . The PREACHER hesitates , gazing at her through the curtain of his sorrowful tears , and goes on with the funeral service . ) Even in the case of this young man Who so suddenly took his own life , There is hope , And I say to the father and mother , And I say to the dear sad sister , Let not your hearts be troubled , For I know the Redeemer liveth evermore And he will not desert his own . ( He closes his eyes an instant in silence . ) Now those who wish may look at the dead . The service will be concluded at the grave . ( A low murmur and stirring show in the yard as the soldiers lift the flag and raise the lid . A young girl moves over to the organ in the room at the left and begins to play a funeral hymn .

O for meMay such a blissful refuge be.Securely shall my ashes lie , Waiting the summons from on high . p. 128 TAPLEY JONES Want to see him , Colin ? COLIN SPENCE Unh ? No , no !

MARSHBURN If there is no one else , I will ask that the lid be closed . LORA GRAHAM ( Suddenly starting up from the chair . ) I will put a flower on his lips , A little flower .

Several of the neighbors look at him in pity and draw away from ELLEN JANE , awed and touched with fear . ) ELLEN JANE ( Loudly . ) He shot him there in the woods ; I saw him do it .

( TAPLEY gestures to COLIN , and going up the steps he passes into the dining room and out through GRAHAM ' S room at the rear . In the room at the left , ELLEN JANE still stands by LORA 'S bed gazing down at her , her face flushed and wet with tears . TAPLEY and COLIN have hardly disappeared through the back of the house when GRAHAM comes around the outhouse at the right , haggard and distrait .

ELLEN JANE ( Calling softly from where she stands by LORA 'S bed , but never looking up . ) Some day in the morning , Or maybe in the night , I 'll come and forgive you , Oscar , Come to your grave and say so . Maybe I will  --  ( Rising to his feet , GRAHAM turns and goes swiftly into the little outhouse at the right , the swinging door closing behind him . ELLEN JANE pulls LORA from the bed , and with her arm in hers , comes down the porch and out into the yard . She looks out before her , a smile fluttering along her lips . ) We are going home now . And little flowers will kiss you at the gate . Oh , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , He says you 're mine now , Mine forevermore . And we 'll be happy , sweet , We will , we will .

( They go across the yard and out at the right front , LORA 'S broken form leaning against ELLEN JANE 'S now sure and vibrant one . In the distance the funeral singing at the grave is heard . TAPLEY and COLIN come in around the outhouse at the right rear . They stand in the yard side by side , silent and thoughtful , TAPLEY weaving his body back and forth and snapping his fingers. ) p. 138 COLIN SPENCE ( With a sharp cry . ) Christ in heaven ! TAPLEY JONES Hunh ? COLIN SPENCE ( Calling . ) Lora , she  --  she 's gone ! ( He runs into the house . TAPLEY hears something in the outhouse . He stops and stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the yard . COLIN comes rushing back down the steps , stops and points off in the direction taken by ELLEN JANE and LORA . ) Look !  --  Look ! ( He gazes around him and starts across the yard at the right front , but TAPLEY catches him fiercely by the arm and pulls him back . ) TAPLEY JONES No , no you wo n't . She 'll have some peace now and he happy . Ellen Jane has got a child , Oscar Graham 's daddied one for her at last .

TAPLEY JONES ( Sternly . ) All 's left that 's good for you . COLIN SPENCE ( Falling down and hugging TAPLEY 'S knees . ) She used to play in the fields with me , At night when I lay down I thought about her . It was sweet to lie and dream about her . And when I rose in the morning , the sky was purty , And the birds sung sweet , Just like her singing . ( Rocking himself in grief . ) I did n't treat her right , And I love her so . ( He springs up and seizes TAPLEY by the arms . ) You did n't like her , You old mad devil . You did n't like her and talked about her mean . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ son . We 've got to work together , Go on the same  --  Summer , winter , spring  --  Day by day and year by year , And trouble will be gone , and sorrow will be over . COLIN SPENCE ( Helplessly , his agony pouring itself out . ) Yes , day after day , And morning on morning , I 'll catch my mule and go to the fields And plough and plough , and row after row , But where 's my pleasure when the crops come up ? What joy is there for me at the corn-siding , And the May-pops cut on the sharp steel sweeps , And the grass turns up to die in the sun ? I 've got to pull at the fodder and pick at the cotton And feed and tend the stock through the summertime , And all through the fall when they 're hungry . And the lonesome winter coming on , She wo n't be parching peanuts .

( COLIN stares at him silent a moment . ) Open the door , you 'll find him there . Open it and see . ( COLIN opens the door , and in the dim light GRAHAM ' S body is half-discerned swinging from a beam . ) COLIN SPENCE ( With a cry . ) My God a'mighty  --  hanged himself ! TAPLEY JONES ( After a moment , letting the door swing shut again . ) Dead  --  dead  --  as a wedge . COLIN SPENCE ( Grinding his hands together . ) Lord have mercy , Lord have mercy ! TAPLEY JONES He has been merciful at last  --  COLIN SPENCE ( Looking fearfully and quickly around at the walls of the house . ) There 's hand somewhere  --  There 's a hand that 's brought it all to pass  --  God 's power  --  TAPLEY JONES Aye , God 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( He goes into the outhouse . COLIN stares frightened and helpless about him and then goes fearfully in after him . The door swings shut behind . In the distance a bugle blows , followed by a volley from a half dozen rifles , and faintly but distinctly the young PREACHER 'S words float gently across the evening air. ) p. 141 PREACHER 'S VOICE Dust to dust  --  in sure and certain hope of the resurrection  --  ( The house stands empty and silent , waiting and listening . The scene fades out. )
