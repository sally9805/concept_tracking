txt For three and a half months , since its return last July to the October , 1933 , lows , the market has been fluctuating indecisively in a broad trading range . It has wittistood two severe tests of the %Dutober lows , the first on July 26 when a selling deluge of more than 3,000.009 shares failed to penetrate the lower resistance points of nine months earlier , and the second on September 17 when on sharply reduced volume the rails , as measured by the Dow-Jones average , penetrated their October low fractionally , while the industrials held not only above their October low but above their July 26 low as well . Now the industrials have broken decisively out of the range on the upside , and on increasing volume , bettering by 3.31 points their August 25 high of 95.71 . Their formation , considered alone , is about as bullish as could be imagined , with their upper resistance level thus broken after three well-defined assaults on it , and with each of the lower stopping places higher than the last . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are regarded as strongly indicating the direction of the move . The fact that the trading range developed right at the level at which the market held on its original descent from the bull market highs of the summer of 1933 adds to the strength of the signal given by the current upward movement , ? when , as and if the mil average confirms it . While the industrials have been forging ahead , the rails have been marking time , and even after Friday 's uprush were still well within not only the broad trading range outlined since last July , but within the narrower , Dow theory line which has been developing since the last week of September between 34.95 and 36.81 . Unless and until the Dow-Jones rail average closes a full point above its August 25 high of 38.42 , the current movement can not be regal ed , under the Dow theory , as a resumption of an important upward trend . First indication that such a development is even likely would be bettering by the rails of their October 11 high of 36.81 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
