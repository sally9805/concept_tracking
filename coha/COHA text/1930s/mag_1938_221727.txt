Waiting on his San Simeon , Calif , doorstep last month , William Randolph Hearst had a shock . Word was brought him that a few miles away , Britain 's top-notch socialites , Lord &; Lady Plunket , arriving as guests in one of his newspapers ' airplanes , had crashed and burned to death . Lady Plunket , 38 , was the only child of Actress Fannie Ward who , at 66 , still weighs 100 pounds , still wears size twelve clothes , still advocates her " cult of youth . " and is known in England as a U. S.-born " perennial flapper . " <P> Last week , departing for England on the Queen Mary with the ashes of her dead , Fannie Ward paused on the pier to sob into a microphone : " My friends of America . . . . I 'm taking my two loved ones on their last journey . . . and I say this to every mother and father in the world : Do n't let your children go in the air unless you want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Last week Transcontinental &; Western Air , Inc. abandoned until summer search for its plane , lost near Fresno March 1 with nine aboard . Said Mrs. Jay Dirlam , whose son and daughter , Tracy and Mary Lou , were aboard the lost plane rushing south to their dying father 's bedside : " I am convinced the disappearance of the plane was one of those unavoidable accidents . The plane was of the best and the pilots were among the best . Under the same circumstances I would still advise my children to take a plane . " <P> For those two pronouncements U.S. airlines could have hugged Mother Dirlam and choked Mother Ward , for the greatest obstacle in the development of air travel is the public 's fear of flight . To counteract the fear propaganda of Fannie Ward and other parents who do their broadcasting less publicly , United Air Lines last week had a new project afoot . It was a child 's book called Air Babies , mothered by Elvy Kalep , a pretty Estonian aviatrix who once aspired to fly the Atlantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sprites , Speedy and his sister Happy-Wings . Various other winged characters teach Speedy and his sister air lore , give them unending confidence in air travel . Its object : to take advantage of the fact that attitudes of mind are quickly and permanently affected by propaganda absorbed in childhood .
