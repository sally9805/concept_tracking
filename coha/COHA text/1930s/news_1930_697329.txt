txt The Standard Oil Company of New Jersey and affiliated companies , serving a vast territory in the United States and the whole of Canada , will enter the automobile tire business two weeks hence , it was disclosed last night by F. H. Bedford Jr. , a director of the company . Free service , a guarantee and lower prices will be offered to the public in competition with garages , he said . The tires will be handled through the thousands of filling stations maintained by the companies interested . Five Companies in Plan . The latter are , besides the Standard Oil of New  --  Jersey , the Standard Oil Company of Pennsylvania , the Standard Oil Company of Louisiana , the Imperial Oil Company of Canada and the Beacon Oil Company , which entered the field experimentally fifteen months ago , Mr. Bedford said . Service stations of these corporations dot the roads of the whole of New England , New York , New Jersey , Delaware , Maryland , North and South Carolina , Virginia , West Virginia , Louisiana , Mississippi , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bedford declared that so far as he knew , reports that the Standard Oil Company of New York and the Texas Company were likewise entering the tire field were unfounded . E. M. Crone , secretary of the Texas Company , declared that he had " heard nothing " of it . Unconfirmed reports however persisted in the financial district that the Texas Company was also about to start a similar plan , which would include the establishment of chains of tire sales and service depots . The reports added that the Texas Company was negotiating for the purchase of one or more tire companies and would enter the manufacturing field also . Follow Lead of Mail Houses . The decision of the oil interests to go into the tire business , Mr. Bedford said , was fostered by the success of the mail order houses , which , of late years , have been doing a huge business , particularly in the less densely populated sections of the country . He estimated the annual tire business of Sears , Roebuck &; Co. , alone at between $35,000,000 and $40,000,000 . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the most important consideration in determining upon the new policy had been that it offered an opportunity to reduce overhead expenses in the operation of the filling stations . " The mail order houses have been free of the burden of advertising and maintaining sales facilities , " he declared . " This has enabled them to undersell the service garages , which have in the past been the chief distributing points for tires . We have decided to take advantage of the facilities which we already have , and at the same time aid the business of our filling stations . " The tires to be sold will be of the same brand as has been handled for more than a year by the Beacon company . Sold under the name " Atlas , " they are manufactured by the makers of the most widely advertised brands , he said . Under an agreement with the makers , their identity could not be disclosed . They will be priced to undersell the " standard advertised " brands such as are handled by garages , but will sell at a slightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ declared . The oil companies plan to offset the additional price , however , by a policy of free service in placing a new tire on the rim or the wheel and by a system of guarantees . Liberal Guarantees Planned . Tires for use on business vehicles will bear a guarantee of six months while tires for use on private automobiles will be guaranteed for one years . In the case of the latter , new tires or repairs will lilt provided free in the event of breakdown before five months of use . ? f breakdown occurs after a longer period of use a refund will be given equal to onetwelfth of the purchase price for each month remaining before the lapse of a year . The policy went into effect quietly two weeks ago in the Pennsylvania company , and distribution is already being made throughout the Standard . Oil Company of New Jersey 's territory , which covers not only that State , but Maryland , North and South Carolina , Virginia , West Virginia and Delaware . The New Jersey company is said to control a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here . The move is expected to have a wide effect not only in the gasoline field but also among the distributers of automobile accessories . It was seen as further evidence of the tendency to centralization in " big business . " In recent years the number of gasoline filling stations has Increased enormously with each large producer of oil seeking every possible outlet for his product . Competition among producers of gasoline and lubricants has virtually set up a different type of garage , supplanting the individually owned garage in many respects . The effect of the decision of the gasoline distributers to handle tires , it is predicted , will cut into an important source of revenue of the garages . The policy of the filling stations in providing " free air , " free " crankcase service , " examination of tires , radiator water , batteries and oil without extra charge , has already I tended to draw motorists to the filling stations rather than to garages for their gasoline . The policy of pro- 1 viding every possible service will I now simply be extended @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Repairs to Be Made on Spot . The filling station will also enter the field of tire repairing , Mr. Bedford disclosed . Instead of owners having to leave faulty tires at a garage and calling for them later , repairs will be made where possible immediately . In the case of tires that have been purchased from filling stations of the company , repairs will be made in many cases free of charge , and a fixed charge will be established for all other repairs . Mr. Bedford declined to make any estimate of the amount of business that the companies for which he spoke expected to obtain , but indicated that the results of the fifteen months ' trial by the Beacon company had been more than satisfactory . He likewise declined to name the total amount of business being handled by the Atlas Tire Company . " I can only say that it has been steadily increasing since the Beacon company first undertook to distribute their tires , " he said . He stressed the decision of the company not to advertise its tires in the usual mediums @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an adjunct to the sale of gasoline and lubricants , but the fact that lack of advertising would save cost in distribution of the tires was expected to assist their sale by permitting lower prices .
