Many times a Carnegie exhibitor , Leon Kroll had never won a Carnegie Prize until last week . Famed for his nudes , his bright , formalized landscapes , Artist Kroll has hung canvases at Pittsburgh 's great international show for 23 years , took an Honorable Mention in 1925 , was even a member of the Carnegie jury in 1929 . Reckoned by quantity of output , Artist Kroll stood less chance of winning this year than at any time since 1913 . So far this year he has done just one oil . Last week that proved sufficient to take his country 's highest painting honor and its $1,000 reward . <P> Working for the Federal Government , Artist Kroll has spent the entire year on two enormous lunettes representing the Defeat and Triumph of Justice for the Attorney General 's new conference room. * They are not yet finished , for Artist Kroll takes his commission seriously , has found mural painting more difficult than he expected . In July and August he went on vacation to his favorite Folly Cove , Cape Ann , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ set up an easel in the back garden , painted the only canvas he has had time for since starting work on the Department of Justice murals . It showed a dirt road winding down between budding willows to the sea ; in the foreground a half-nude workman lies on a sunny rock ; one woman kneels beside him while another is climbing up from the fields below ( see cut ) . For models Artist Kroll used a onetime ditchdigger and sculptor 's assistant named Jim McClellan , Mrs. Demetrios , wife of Sculptor George Demetrios , a farmer 's daughter named Olga . He named the canvas The Road From the Cove , sent it to Pittsburgh , where it was judged preeminent by an exacting jury : precise Surrealist Pierre Roy of France ; British Muralist Alfred Kingsley Lawrence ; ailing Edward Bruce , director of the first Federal Art Projects ; convivial Guy Pne du Bois . To win over the 323 other entries from six countries , Artist Kroll 's canvas had to beat : <P> A vivid genre painting of a Midwestern barber shop by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dali , showing a vast dark cypress tree rising against an evening sky from which grows a half-opened book transfixed by a peg on which droops one of Artist Dali 's limp watches . <P> A fine fat Venus by Italy 's Giovanni Romagnoli . <P> Susan , a portrait study of a plump young blonde by Eugene Speicher . <P> Two Women , a pastel-toned oil in the familiar , delicately decadent manner of France 's aging Marie Laurencin . <P> When the jury last week decided that Artist Kroll 's picture outranked all of these , it also awarded the second prize of $600 to spectacled French Post-Impressionist Pierre Bonnard for a gaily colored still life of a breakfast table , the $500 third prize to a study of two stolid peasant women leaning over a table , the work of Spain 's Pedro de Valencia .
