txt Special Correspondence . THE New YORK TIMES . WHITE PLAINS , N. Y. , Oct. 6 . H The annual budget-making performance in White Plains and Mount Vernon was re-enacted during the past few days with politicians and taxpayers playing familiar roles . In Mount Vernon , where a slight tax-rate reduction was effected by postponing some necessary expenditures , taxpayers failed to raise their voices , but in White Plains where the rate will be the highest in the city 's history , there was all kinds of trouble . To those acquainted with the two municipalities the performances were typical . Particularly was the conduct of the taxpayers true to form . There was no indication that events of only a year ago were remembered . Pre-Election Budgets . Both White Plains and Mount Vernon , the only cities in Westchester County to adopt budgets before election day , got through their public hearings last year with little difficulty . Both administrations sought to please the taxpayers , so both cut their budgets to unreasonably low figures . They cut so low , in fact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to lend money . Mount Vernon was virtually without funds and credit for several months owing to the gesture of its politically minded administration . White Plains also found no money available . Both cities were compelled to adopt supplementary budgets and levy an additional tax . The taxpayers , of course , objected , but it was the price that had to be paid for political pre-election generosity . It was largely to guard against a recurrence of last year 's experience that the White Plains administration increased its estimates for 1935 . About $600,000 was included in the proposed budget as a " cushion " against uncollected taxes . By this action the administration hopes to enhance its credit so it can refinance about $550,000 bonds on Oct. 10 . If the bonds are sold , their principal amount will be cut from the budget estimate , lowering the tax rate by several points . New Rochelle , which adopts its budget later in the year , also has adopted the " cushion " principle for 1935 . No " Cushion " for Mount Vernon . The taxpayers in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , have more cause for concern than those in White Plains who are so fearful of overtaxation . The reduction of the Mount Vernon budget last week will , according to students of the subject , result in added - expense . Instead of keeping a $150,000 welfare item in the budget it was decided to raise this sum by a bond sale , thus simply postponing the day when the taxpayers will have to pay . The Mount Vernon 1935 budget has no " cushion " provision . Controller John Lynn said the administration was counting on " unexpended balances " for that purpose , but whether this hope will be realized will depend on how much money the city departments spend . The critics of the White Plains budget cried : " Close the schools for a month , " and " Let 's ylefault on our bonds and jeopardize the city 's credit if we can save our homes that way . " They were a desperate throng and amazingly uninformed about city finances .               @ @ @ @ @ @
