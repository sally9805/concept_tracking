txt District Attorney William F. X. Geoghan began today an aggressive and emphatic defense in removal proceedings before Governor Lehman by blaming Police Commissioner Valentine for whatever failure there was in the prosecution of the Sam Drukman murder case . He blamed the Police Commissioner directly for the official inaction that followed the charge by Detective Charles S. Corbett that the case had been " fixed " by bribery . The Kings County District Attorney and the defense counsel , Lloyd Paul Stryker , asserted that Valentine declared Corbett was " crazy " and a " nut , " erratic and unworthy of credence . Throughout the three hours and twenty minutes that Mr. Geoghan was on the stand he maintained his attitude of confidence . He explained his own operations in the Drukman case with assurance , and when cross-examined by Assistant Attorney General Hiram C. Todd he repeatedly challenged Mr. Todd to tell him how he could have improved his methods of murder investigation . Then , when the special prosecutor offered suggestions , the District Attorney clashed sharply with him . Walker Hearing Recalled Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his very life " in the same historic Executive chamber where former Mayor James J. Walker four years ago faced Governor Roosevelt in similar proceedings , a hearing which ended abruptly when Mr. Walker resigned before the completion of his defense . The great , red-carpeted chamber , hung with the portraits of most of New York State 's Governors , had been made over into something like a court room , with a solid brass rail setting off one end for 200 spectators . The Governor sat behind a broad , flat desk at the opposite end , directly in front of a large portrait of George Clinton , first Governor of the State . Mr. Geoghan , white-haired , pinkfaced and brightly attired in a light tan suit and sport shoes , entered the room shortly before 2 o'clock , accompanied by Mrs. Geoghan , her sister , Mrs. Margaret M. Conway , and the three Geoghan children , Helen , Margaret and the young son whom the District " Attorney calls " Billie Jr . " The Geoghan family took seats inside the rail , across the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Governor 's counsel , sat knitting and listening . Mr. Lehman entered promptly at 2 o'clock and emphasized the solemnity of the atmosphere by announcing that he would permit no applause or other expression of emotion , and that he would permit no photographs of the room , even when the hearing was not in session . He read an announcement of the form of procedure he had adopted and made it clear that there would be no " prosecutor " at the hearing . Turns to Responsibility In seeking to fix responsibility for the laxity with which the Drukman murderers were pursued , Mr. Todd asked Mr. Geoghan if he were responsible for the investigation of the murder between March 4 , the day after it happened , and March 25 , the end of the period of alleged incompetency . To that the witness replied : " The entire responsibility is mine from beginning to end of the Drukman case , and from the beginning to the end of every case in my of- HEARING IN ALBANY through his questions , implied that Mr. Geoghan had failed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who was secreted in a cell between Meyer and Harry Luckman and overheard them talking about a lawyer " fixer " and money changing hands . Mr. Todd led up to this line of inquiry by asking if Mr. Geoghan had obtained any impression that there were money difficulties between . the Luckmans and the slain Drukman . Mr. Geoghan said he had no information on that subject early in his investigation of the case . " And you did not follow that up in any way ? " asked Mr. Todd . " We followed that up later on , " responded Mr. Geoghan . Q. ? When ? A. ? Before we completed our investigation . Q. ? You did n't follow it up until after Barshay was assigned on March 23 , did you ? A. That is a follow-up , is n't it ? What would you do ? Q. ? Please answer my question . A. ? I am answering your question . That is following it up . Q. ? Did you follow it up before Barshay was assigned to the case on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it up after Barshay got in the case and before it was presented to the grand jury . Policeman Is Quoted Mr. Todd then read as follows from the testimony of Sedlak concerning a conversation between Meyer Luckman and Harry Luckman which the policeman overheard : " Q. ? Meyer said to Harry , what did he say ? A. ? Something about $1,300 changing hands . I could n't get the very end of the sentence . Then Harry said , ' Do n't talk too much . ' Then Meyer said , ' The lawyer , small one , is a fixer ; the other one not worth a nickel . ' " Mr. Todd then continued : Q. ? Was that , in substance , conveyed to you prior to March 22 , 1935 ? A. ? I do n't know just when it was conveyed to me . Q. ? Are n't you able to fix a time within a month as to what information was conveyed to you ? A. ? I am not ; I think we have been all over that . Mr. Stryker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We have had it , I think , half a dozen times . Mr. Todd  --  The reason I am bringing it up again is because upon the reading of that testimony by counsel for the respondent , the part in reference to the lawyer fixer was not brought out , and I desire to bring it out so that it would be before Your Excellency 's mind that that subject ' matter was brought out before the April grand jury . Mr. Stryker  --  What do you mean , I did n't bring it out ? I brought out everything that you brought out in your direct and showed the fact . Do n't start charging me with that . There are the minutes . I offered them there . The- Governor ? We are not going to have any recriminations here . I was familiar with that because I had pretty carefully read the minContinued From Page One fice , whether I personally take care of it or not . " But when Governor Lehman interposed with questions demanding specific recital of activities in the quest for a motive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squarely on the Police Department . The Governor asked shy the books of the Luckman brothers ( in whose garage Drukman was slain ) were not seized before March 23 , almost three weeks after the murder , in an attempt to ascertain a motive for the crime . The District Attorney declared at first that he did not think the idea suggested itself to any one before that date . He said Assistant District Attorney Barshay , who prosecuted the case in the beginning and later was withdrawn , finally suggested obtaining the books and did so with detectives ' assistance . Up to Police , Says Witness " That is police work anyway , " the witness explained . " If they were seized by anybody before that time they should have been seized by police , but they were not . " Governor Lehman interrogated Mr. Geoghan concerning the flight and suicide of Hyman Kantor , the key witness in the Drukman killing . " That again is work the Police Department should do , " replied the District Attorney in explaining why the fugitive had not been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between the responsibility of a District Attorney and of a Police Department . I feel that while the District Attorney frequently does the work of a Police Department , if he omits to do some of it , he should not be held responsible for not so doing . " To that the Governor made no comment . But he asked why reports of the relations between the Drukman , Luckman and Kantor families were not run down . Again the District Attorney blamed the Police Department for that negligence . " There are leads , " he said , " that should have been found and followed by the Police Department , especially the Detective Bureau and more especially the homicide squad . " Mr. Geoghan then surprised those at the hearing by saying that Kantor , the fugitive suicide , would have been murdered himself if he had not taken flight . For the freedom that the fugitive enjoyed before he was found dead in Chicago , the witness threw the blame on the Police Department again . " Followed Every Lead " " We followed every lead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few county detectives . The Police Department is 18,000 men . We worked in conjunction with them , but I refuse to accept responsibility that belongs to them , and I feel that , without trying to shift any responsibility , they must bear theirs as I bear mine . " I think Kantor made the anonymous call that brought the police to the garage that night . In my opinion he would have met the fate of Drukman , that he would have been murdered . " The Governor remained silent and Mr. Todd expressed no opinion on the theory for Kantor 's flight and death . From the outset of the proceeding the Governor emphasized repeatedly that he intended to give Mr. Geoghan the fullest freedom in his own defense , unconfined by the limitations of law as administered in court . Often he authorized him to go into phases of his administration outside the field covered by the charges . On several occasions the Governor sustained Mr. Geogban over Mr. Todd 's protests . At the very beginning the Governor permitted Mr. Stryker to deliver an address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the charges , then refused to permit the special prosecutor to do more than enter a brief denial . Mr. Stryker charged in his opening address that Mr. Geoghan has been " on trial by cartoon " and the " poisonous black atmosphere " engendered by editorial attacks of The World-Telegram , and now welcomed the opportunity of appearing before the Governor to show that he was innocent . He implied that Mr. Todd had had a hand in The World-Telegram attacks , and insinuated that the publication of the charges against Mr. Geoghan , filed with the Governor by the special grand jury , had been obtained by that paper with Mr. Todd 's aid . This was denied later by Mr. Todd . Makes Charge of " Hypocrisy " Mr. Stryker characterized the grand jury 's charges as " warmed over " from the campaign of Joseph D. for District Attorney last Fall . He said the charges were made in bad faith and accused the jurors and their special counsel of ' hypocrisy . " Mr. Stryker emphasized the fact that President Roosevelt , who preceeded Governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to entertain removal charges against Sheriff James A. of Kings County because they were based on actions during a previous term of office . He took the view that the charges against Mr. Geoghan , originating as they did in the campaign , were erased and that the prosecutor was vindicated by his re-election by a Majority of 147,000 . Addressing the Governor and his advisers , Dean Charles K. Burdick of Cornell Law School and former Supreme Court Justice James V. Coffey of Troy , Mr. Stryker declared : " I am anxious now , after these - long months of badgering and abuse in the press , particularly in the columns of one newspaper which has made it a settled policy , if possible , to destroy this man , I may now here say to Your Excellency and to your learned advisers that I am glad and Mr. Geoghan is glad that at last we have come into a forum of justice where orderly procedure will prevail , where fairness will be the rule , where there will be no more striking in the back , no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news releases , but on the facts , the sworn proof . " May I now state very briefly my own analysis of the charges ? I shall make a very brief statement of what we expect to show . I know , as the world knows , Your Excellency 's interest in the administration of justice and in the improvement of the administration of justice . " I think in connection with what I have said about the unjust , unfair , underhanded press attack on this man by at least one newspaper , I would like just in passing to read you a line or two of an editorial of a great newspaper which I think is a leader in the ethical conception of newspaper publishing . " A day or two ago , perhaps it was last week , an editorial appeared in the paper to which I refer , THE Nzw YORK TIMES . I wo n't read it to you ; perhaps Your Excel-. lency saw it ; but it commented upon a report of the American Bar Association with respect to the ethics of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ govern papers in England . It referred to the fact that not long ago in England , when a man was caught red-banded with a gun about to shoot the sovereign of the British Empire , one morning newspaper referred to him as an assassin and immediately that newspaper was fined because , forsooth , as yet at that time it had not been judicially determined that he was an assassin . " I commend that example to The New York World-Telegram . " In the course of that editorial , Tire NEW YORE Trains in referring to that incident in England said : ' It is unnecessary to contrast this scrupulous behavior with the broad license which exists in the United States . In many instances following arrest in a criminal case in which there is wide public interest the more sensational accounts are thoroughly prejudicial to a fair trial . Sometimes headlines din into the public consciousness the belief that an ironclad case has been built up by the prosecution or the defense . By the time the court proceedings are actually begun , a large part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ points at issue . ' Hostile Attack Assailed " In this case it is n't the facts that have borne down on my client , it is the hostile , determined newspaper attack on the part particularly of one newspaper . " In the course of his address Mr. Stryker said he would reserve the right to make motions at the end of the proceeding . After Mr. Todd had been permitted to make a brief statement in refutation of the charges made by Mr. Stryker , and was precluded by the Governor from discussing at this time any cf the facts and merits of the case , the Governor called Mr. Geoghan to the witness stand , administered the oath , and said : " Mr. District Attorney , the first of the three charges that are before me is the following : " That the District Attorney demonstrated negligence and gross incompetence in the investigation and prosecution of the Drukman murder case . " I have already announced that I will consider these charges specification by specification . The first specification of Charge 1 reads as follows : " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took substantially no action to present the case to the grand jury or to investigate it further . ' " Now , Mr. District Attorney , will you tell me in your own words ? and take as much time as youwant , of course , to do so ? exactly what action did you take in the Drukman case between March 4 and March 23 , and what investigation you made ? Mr. Geoghan replied : " I shall . I assume Your Excellency has no objection to my refreshing my recollection by having before me a copy of my answer . " The Governor : " Of course not . " Mr. Geoghan : " Of course , I deny each and every allegation contained not only in that charge but also in the specification which Your Excellency has just read . " I might say in general that the only difference in the handling of the Drukman case ( and this will go for all of these charges ) and any other homicide or murder case in my office is that I personally did more , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ probably more industriously in the Drukman case than it ever has in any other murder case in my experience , and that covers some thirteen and a half years In the District Attorney 's office . Explains Department Routine " In my office since I have been the District Attorney of the county , and I am following the routine and the methods that were adopted by those who have preceded me and under whom I served , we have a homicide bureau , and each week I assign an assistant or a deputy assistant and also a stenographer , the duty of whom is to respond to every homicide call which is transmitted to the assistant , the deputy or to the stenographer from the telegraph bureau of the Police Department . " On this particular case a call came through the telegraph bureau of the Police Department to my assistant , some time , of course , after the commission of the murder . The exact hour I do not know , but that would be recorded on the police records of the telegraph bureau . " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proceeded to the scene of the crime , which was 225 " Moore Street in our county . He took with him on that occasion Mr. John Lynch , who was the stenographer regularly assigned . " Mr. was on the homicide duty that night and my recollection was that he was taking the place for that night only of another assistant , Mr. Digiovanna , who for some reason or other was not available on that occasion . So Mr. responded to the call . " Investigation of a case requires very tedious and painstaking work . It requires a lot of cooperation on the part of the Police Department and the District Attorney 's office and necessarily on the part of those witnesses upon whom the prosecutor must depend for establishment of a prima facie case for the purpose of procuring an indictment , and then later on for the purpose of submitting that evidence to a trial court for the purpose of securing a conviction in the opinion of the twelve men who are called to sit in judgment upon the one accused . " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in every other case . Made Cursory Examination " Mr. called at the scene of the murder , which was a garage owned by and operated by the Luckman brothers , and he made an examination , a cursory one , probably , at that time of the physical features of the scene of the crime , and from the garage be went immediately to the Eightyfifth Precinct , which is the Stagg Street precinct in Brooklyn , and there he interrogated some formally , and by that I mean their answers were taken down stenographically , and others informally , where no stenographic notes were taken . " He interrogated the detectives , ranking officials , those who were accused of the crime or suspected of it and who were at that time held in custody in the Stagg Street police station . " Mr. Geoghan said the basis for what he said and the basis of his answer up to this point would be found in the extraordinary grand jury minutes . The District Attorney then went on to give a detailed story of the night of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ including statements taken from witnesses that night . He then described ' how , after that , the case was left in the hands of Mr. and Mr. McCarthy , and led up to the discovery of the existence of Harry Kantor , bookkeeper for the Luckmans . " I do n't know how many of my assistants took any steps to actually go out and find Kantor , " Mr. Geoghan said under cross-examination . " That , again , is work that the Police Department should do ; and in this case , Your Excellency , I feel that a distinction should be made between the responsibility of a District Attorney and the responsibility of the Police Department . " I feel that while the District Attorney frequently does the work of the Police Department , if he omits to do something of it he should not be held responsible for not so doing . " In the final minutes Mr. Todd , utes myself . I recall that it was in the minutes . I do n't quite see what lyou are trying to establish by that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it please Your Excellency , that the District Attorney had this information from a police officer that was a definite lead that an effort was being made to fix the Drukman case by the use of money and that he did not follow that lead in any particular or way and that he had that information shortly after March 4 and before March 21 and he did nothing about it . The Governor ? He did present it to the grand jury ? Mr. Todd ? He presented it to the grand jury , but he did n't follow it up . Mr. Geoghan  --  Follow it up ? in what way , what do you mean ? Mr. Todd  --  Follow it up by finding the witnesses who would give the testimony to show that money was used in the Drukman case , the same as it was produced in the case that we tried under the conspiracy indictment . Mr. Geoghan  --  Again I say through no testimony that Sedlak gave did you convict anybody . It meant absolutely nothing . More atmosphere that you threw into that case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Smith climbed a tree , " and it would have as much connection as Sedlak 's testimony . Order to Subordinate The Governor ? Mr. Todd , let me ask you this question : You introduced this slip of paper signed by the District Attorney , assigning Mr. Barshay ? Mr. Todd  --  Exhibit No. 1 . The Governor  --  What in your opinion is the significance of the fact that there was a written order for that ? Mr. Todd ? I have been trying to find out and I expect when Mr. Barshay takes the stand I will ask him something about it . It has been rather mysterious to me , from the very beginning , as to why the District Attorney took this unusual method of assigning an assistant to a case ; and then there is a connection which will be brought out of the testimony , and that is that after Barshay had been assigned to this case , on the 21st of March , taken off all his other work , and he did active and energetic work during the month of April , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the grand jury he was withdrawn from the case . The Governor  --  That is an entirely different question . I rather gathered that you attached some significance to the fact that this order was written rather than an oral order . I was wondering whether there was some significance in your mind . I assume there is not in that particular thing , although there may be some significance In the fact that Mr. Barshay was put on this case and then taken off . Mr. Todd ? I should rather withhold any comment that I have to make in that regard until we have had an opportunity to examine Mr. Barshay . The Governor  --  All right . Is there anything you want to say , Mr. Stryker ? Mr. Stryker  --  Nothing that I think of now . Elrst Specification Closed The Governor ? Is there any further way in which you desire to cross-examine , to interrogate the District Attorney on this specification No. 1 , because otherwise I shall consider this specification completed ? You of course always have the right to request me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I will consider this specification closed unless you have something to add to it at this time . Mr. Todd ? As I am presently advised there are no further questions I desire to ask . It may be that I will think of something overnight , but if I do , of course , I will address I Your Excellency with a request stating the substance of it so that you might see whether or not it is of sufficient importance to justify further cross-examination . The Governor ? Mr. Geoghan , have you got anything further to say with reference to this particular specification ? Mr. Geoghan  --  Nothing further , except I think there is great stress being placed upon this written order . I do n't know what that is all about . They are trying to make it mysterious . There is nothing mysterious about it at all . I gave a reason for it , possibly , that in handing that to Barshay he could give it to Mr. Cummings , who regularly assigns the assistants , as authorization from me that he was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not mean anything . I might just as well have said it by word of mouth . Mr. Stryker ? It happened that Barshay came in to you about 6:30 at night ? Mr. Geoghan  --  Yes . Mr. Stryker  --  And do you know of any other , any sinister reason ? Mr. Geoghan  --  There is nothing mysterious about it . The Governor  --  What is Mr. Cummings ? Mr. Geoghan ? Mr. Cummings is the deputy chief clerk in the office . The Governor ? I see . The entire first day of the trial was devoted to the first of the twenty specifications concerning the alleged lack of activity in the accused District Attorney 's office during the two weeks following the Drukman murder . A great deal of Mr. Geoghan 's testimony was in effect an elaborated restatement of what he had said in his printed answer . From the witness stand in the somber-hued Executive chamber , Mr. Geoghan repeatedly pounded home the argument that it was the responsibility of the Police Department to do the investigating in the Drukman murder . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other members of the family , the Luckman family , or Drukman family , in addition to Rebecca and Bessie ? " asked Mr. Todd at one point . " No , I do n't recall any specific directions , " said Mr. Geoghan . " Again I say that that ought to have been done by the police . That is the effort that has been made all along in this case , to shift responsibility from the Police Department to District Attorney Geoghan . It is pretty near time they took some of the responsibility . " Defines His Responsibility " Is it not the practice of your office to keep in touch with the Police Department in connection with the investigation of a murder ? " persisted Mr. Todd . " It is , " retorted Mr. Geoghan , " and it is the practice of the Police Department to make investigations and to bring in witnesses as well as those charged with crime . That is their responsibility . Mine is to prosecute . " " And it is the responsibility of the District Attorney 's office @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been gathered so that the District Attorney may tell when to present the case to the grand jury ? " asked Mr. Todd . " Yes , exactly , " replied Mr. Geoghan . " In other words , it IS his duty to prosecute . The duty of the Police Department is to apprehend those charged with the crime and also to bring in the witnesses . " What did you do between March 4 the day after the murder and March 23rd with reference to ascertaining what had been done during that period by the Police Department-in connection with this case ? " inquired Mr. Todd . " Everything I did I have already placed upon the record . " " Are you able to tell us any police official with whom you discussed the case ? " Mr. Todd asked . ' No , I do not , " replied Mr. Geoghan . " You can ask the Police Commissioner that question . Maybe he can tell you . " " I am trying to find out , " persisted Mr. Todd , " what contact you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case . " " I do n't recall any specific conversations , " replied Mr. Geoghan . " It would be pretty hard for me to remember all of these details . " The Governor went to the Executive Mansion for dinner shortly after 7 P. M. , when the inquiry was adjourned until 10 o'clock tomorrow morning . Valentine in Albany Today Commissioner Valentine and two departmental officials announced yesterday that they would be in Albany this morning to testify in the Geoghan hearing . Deputy Chief Inspector John J. Ryan , who was in charge of Brooklyn detectives at the time of the Drukman murder , and Acting Lieutenant John J. Baker , an aide of Ryan , are the officials .
