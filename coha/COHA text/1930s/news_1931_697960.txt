txt Now that the shouting is over and that great reception which . New York gave us is a thing of the past , Gatty and I had a chance this afternoon to sit back , draw a breath and get some of our impressions together . First of all , let me take this opportunity to thank the city and everybody in it , from .. Mayor Walker and Dr. Finley to the street cleaners , who are going to have to clean up the litter we caused , fur that magnificent welcome to us today . I do n't know that we earned it , but I 'll admit we liked it . Out West , lots of people think New York is cold and reserved . But there can not be any warmer-hearted people in the world than those who welcomed us back today . The reception showed us more than just that , though . It showed us something that I believe is important in the development of aviation . The reception was for the successful completion of a flight which could not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made this time only because such excellent equipment was at our command in plane , motor and instruments . Frankly , we were.surprised at the enthusiasm shown last night when we arrived and today when we received the city 's official welcome . We had wondered if , with so many flights , the public had lost its enthusiasm . But today showed that the public is still very much interested in aviation and is thrilled at each new event which brings the day of universal flying closer . Hopes Flight Will Aid Air Commerce . As to our flight itself . We think we really have accomplished something more than tearing around the world faster than anybody ever made it before . We have great hopes that we may have helped bring the time closer when commercial aviation will span the seas and the land , and bring all peoples closer together . We believe the route we followed is practicable from the standpoint of commercial aviation . Of course , much would have to be done before it could be put to such use ; but the route itself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that has yet been suggested . It turned out to be very much what we had expected , except that we ran into worse weather than we had counted on . But the air fields which we found sprinkled around the world gtvee good service , and fields established to handle regular commercial traffic would of course be equipped to furnish even better . So we hope that we will see the time when planes carrying passengers will be dropping down on the fields and roaring across the spaces that we saw on our trip in the Winnie Mae . We learned something from the flight , too . Any time any one makes a flight like the one we have just finished , he is bound to learn something . We learned things about navigation and ' tested out for ourselves recent improvements in instruments , though , to be accurate , there is much more to be learned about aerial navigation than is now known . It is a young science . One thing I learned is that a man can sit in a plane , stay there for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to even if he ca n't see anything beyond the instrument board . We did that repeatedly in this flight , and I would think that the general public 's just knowing that such a thing was possible would increase confidence in aviation . Says Public Exaggerates Hardships . We are finding from the questions that people ask us that they exaggerate the hardships and the strain on pilot and navigator due to a long , fast trip such as ours . I 'll admit we were tired when we landed and we still are tired . We had only four or five hours ' sleep last night after going on short rest rations most of the flight . But we do n't feel any ill effects of it today . I 'm still pretty deaf , but be able to hear pretty well by tomorrow . As a matter of fact , I could hear better in the plane than I could on land , and it is the absence of the motor 's vibration that makes it hard for me to hear now . We did not do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flight we took as good care of ourselves as circumstances permitted . I was in good condition wIlen I started and am now , except that my leg is still sore from kicking the rudder . We drank plenty of water and ate very little food ? not more than one meal a day . We ate hardly at all in the plane . That kept us fresh . And we are not particularly hungry now . We . had no trouble keeping awake on the long stretches , which seems to ' surprise some people , and I think we actually felt better late along in the flight when we felt certain we were going to get there , than we did in the earls stages . - We did n't take any-intoxicants . I do n't use them at all and we simply ? clid n't need any stimulants . Flying:is a habit ; like lots ' a other things . If you get the habit , you 'll never get over it . You would think I had had enough flying to do me for a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll be impatient to get in the air again . Just What our future plans are neither Gatty nor I can say now . We have heard all sorts of reports about things we are supposed to be preparing ? new flights and the like . As a matter of fact , we have no plans whatever . , We both want to go home , of course , but we do not know when that will be .. A number of offers of various sorts have come for us , we are- told , but we have n't had time to consider them and do not even know what most of them are . One was an offer to go on the stage . That 's a joke . That 's the last thing we would do . One feature of our trip brings us. a chuckle . Here we 've been around the world and have spent a tremendous day in New York , and we literally have n't spent a cent . We had $35 when we left New York for incidental expenses . I had $34 of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've still got it . We never had a chance to buy anything . Of course , arrangements had been made in advance at all fields for our gasoline and oil , and these were purchased on credit . But on our personal expenses we were treated to such ' generous hospitality everywhere that we never got our hands near our pocketbooks . Gatty Tells of His Work as Navigator . By HAROLD GATTY , Navigator of the Monoplane Winnie Mae . World Copyright , 1931 , by The New York Times Company . Publication in whole or in part forbidden . As a navigator , our flight around the world impressed me with two facts . One is that instruments and mathematical tables used in determining position must be vastly improved . The other is that our radio was of virtually no use . I had looked forward to the flight for a long time for the oppertunity it would offer to study the practical application of the latest developments in instruments . and technique of aero-navigation . Ever since I was a cadet at the Australia Naval College , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ years old , navigation has interested me . What I learned at the Naval College I put to practical use for six or seven years as a deck officer on merchant ships . Then , three and a half years ago , I took up the study of aero-navigation in this country under Lieut . Commander Philip Weems , who is now an.instructor at . the Naval Academy at . Annapolis . This is different and offers more problems than navigation at sea because of high speed and other factors peculiar to flight . Helped Develop New Navigation System . What he taught me I had a chance to put to some use in fairly long flights on the West Coast . Weems and I worked up some new methods for calculations in celestial navigation , using what is known as the Weems system .. In this , system you use a bubble sextant and , an aero-chronometer . As any one who has had anything to do with navigation knows , with a bubble sextant you do n't have to worry about the horizon . Flying over the Siberian wilderness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was possible to see the sun or the stars , we could count on the bubble sextant to give us an accurate reading , whether or not the horizon was hazy . The aero-chronometer is designed to offset the difficulty that the rapid speed of an airplane adds to making a calculation . At sea you can note the time . an observation by glancing at- , he second-hand of a chronometer and remembering where it pointed . This is all right when you are traveling at- the slow speed of a ship , but it leads to inaccuracies when you are flying . The advantage of the aero-chronometer is that it provides a mechanical check on the exact instant of observation . These instruments are just coming into use now . The more I learn about navigation the more impressed I am by how little is known of the subject . The army and navy are taking up these new instruments and I am sure that they will be used universally ' as time goes on . I found that it was more satisfactory to take sights on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you one line to calculate on . If you have an adequate set of tables , sights on the stars are no more complicated than sights on the sun . The time may come when navigators may not depend so much on celestial observations and use the radio instead , as is done to ' a greater extent now than formerly by navigators on ships . Found Radio Set a Dead Weight . Our radio , however , proved to be very nearly just so much dead weight . We regarded the transmitter as more important than the receiver because of its , usefulness in an emergency . We signaled on it considerably as we were nearing Ireland , then again on the way to Nome , but as far as I know , nobody heard us . As far as radio weather reports were concerned , we did n't get any . Of course we did n't have much time to listen , and on a large part of our flight , the part where weather reports would have been of most value , if there were any , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ able to understand them if we had got them . The weather reports are usually sent out on long waves , and long-wave equipment weighs too much at present to be desirable on an airplane that is making a long distance flight . Because of our experience with the radio , which has convinced us that airplane radios must be improved a lot if they are going to be of use on such flights , I believe that we must look to improved methods of celestial-navigation . In time , I believe , this work will be made virtually automatic . Mathematical tables have already eliminated much of the routine of calculation , but they can be improved still further . There will also be ' improvements in sextants . Tried Out Ground Speed Indicator . One personal satisfaction that I had in the trip was the opportunity it gave me to try out in very thorough fashion a ground speed indicator that I have devised . It also indicates the drift , and since our drift while crossing the Atlantic was at times as high as 19 per cent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . My device consists merely of an endless film , cut across by fine parallel lines . The film is kept in motion at a speed synchronous with that of the movement of the plane over the ground or the water . Observations are made by looking through it at whatever we happen to be passing over . A periscope near the instrument board enables this to be done . Ordinarily you have to make observations on a fixed point in order to calculate ground - speed and drift . I found my indicator satisfactory , but there is ? plenty of room for improvement in it as in other instruments . The watchword in navigation instruments must always be increased speed and . greater accuracy . As I look . back over the flight  --  and with so many things to do it seems impossible that it was only yesterday that we completed ' it  --  I do n't believe there was a moment when we doubted that we would make a success of it . Of course there were several tight places . But , thanks perhaps to good instruments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a fog , as some transatlantic fliers are believed to have done . We owe a lot to our instruments . Good instruments enable you to cope with lots of situations that otherwise might beat you . I have tried to write on the practical aspects of the flight but I can not refrain from saying a word or two about the reception Wiley and I have received in New York . We did n't know it would be anything like this . It is tremendous and nothing I can say would express my feelings about it . It is a great honor and we appreciate it very deeply .  - -  Such flights will be made again but at present they are not easy . They have got to be well-planned . I think that our route was the best one and ' Would take it if I were to try to fly around the world again . A large part , of it-will be ilown-by commercial planes in the future . As for:future flights by Wiley and myself , we have no- plans whatever . There : is , nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't talked of It
