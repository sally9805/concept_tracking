JERUSALEM THE GOLDEN A STORY BY VINCENT SHEEAN W HEN the S.S. Wistaria arrived at Jaffa and discharged its two hundred tourists upon the land promised to Moses , there were a few superior persons who refused to be hurried . " So far as I am concerned , " Mrs. Salisbury said to her husband , " I do n't care if I never see Haifa and those places . I 'm going straight to Jerusalem and stay there all three days . After all , you know , it 's the Holy City . " She thus consigned the unholier spots in the country to the attention of the Wistaria 's ordinary passengers , to be inspected by them on the wing , as Algeria , Tunis , and Egypt had already been inspected . Mrs. Salisbury was no unrcluctaut participant in most of these shore excursions , but here she felt that she owed it to her dignity as a pillar of the First Presbyterian Church of Benbrook ( Ohio ) to go slow . As she explained to Alec , this was a time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All my life , " she said , watching with abstracted eyes the behavior of a young Arab who had taken charge of their luggage , " all my life I have wanted to see the place where .. . " At this paint their particular Arab was set upon by a band of some twenty others who struggled with him for possession of the Salisbury belongings . " Hi ! " said Mrs. Salisbury . " The impl Alec ! Ca n't you do something ? It 'll all go in the water ! " It seemed for a time as if not only the Salisbury belongings , but those of every other passenger on the Wistaria , were destined to the antique bottom of Jaffa harbor . In the confusion and uproar the harbor has known since the days of its earlier tourist , Jonah , some hundreds of red-capped Arabs gave battle for the transatlantic spoils . Mrs. Salisbury 's best pigskin bag bumped alarmingly over the rail of a very small boat before two of the contestants managed to arrest it in a temporary equilibrium over blue @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unavailing , but the Wistaria 's passengers were not all as philosophical as Mr. Salisbury . " I bet , " he said judiciously , " on the little fellow with the big wart on his nose . He looks as if he pulled a lot of weight . " The partitioning of the baggage was accomplished at last , to the surprise of those who ( like Mrs. Salisbury ) felt that nothing could ever get itself done in such clamorous disorder . Somehow , in spite of noise , bright colors , and a sunlight so brilliant that it made every simplest thing Look preternaturally dangerous , the journey ashore was completed and the Salisburys stood intact at the railway station . " Dear me , are n't you going on the tour with the others , Mrs. Dolan ? " said Mrs. Salisbury . She was not altogether pleased to see a familiar face . " I 'm not , " said Mrs. Dolan firmly , clutching at the hand of her daughter Rose-Marie . " I 'm in coming all the way here unless we spend as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Yes , " said Mrs. Salisbury vaguely , " yes . I suppose so . We had something of the same idea . " " Of course we 'll see Bethlehem and the River Jordan too , " Mrs. Dolan explained hastily , as if her first statement had been questioned as unorthodox . " And we 'll join the boat at Haifa , going through Nazareth on the way . But we 'll stay in Jerusalem . I 've been waiting for this trip too tong . . " " Well , well , well , " a round , rather juicy voice broke in , " if it is n't the Dolans and the Saiisburys ! Mother and I figured we 'd be the only people going straight up to Jerusalem . Are n't you going on the tour with the others ? " " I 'm not , Mr. Baumberg , " said Mrs. Dolan . " Jim and I thought we 'd just stay in the Holy City for the three days . " " The thought , " said Mr. Salisbury , enjoying himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going to read a paper on the Holy City to the ladies ' club of the church when she gets back . " " I never intended to read a paper to any club , Alexander , " said Mrs. Salisbury majestically . " I do not need such an excuse to spend three days in the Holy City of my religion . " " Your religion ? " said Mrs. Baumberg before she reflected . Then hastily she added : " Of course we get so used to thinking of it as . . . " " Quite , " said Mrs. Salisbury . " Alexander , will you see that one of these brigands gets our luggage in ? I am going to get into the train . " " What 's a Holy City , mother ? " Rose-Marie Dolan asked mournfully . She was a silent , sad little girl with adenoids , who seldom spoke except to ask an awkward question . " It 's a place where very holy things happened a long time ago , darling , " said Mrs. Dolan . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Rose-Marie ominous possibilities in connection with their present destination . She tugged at her mother 's hand . " Did all the catechism happen there , mom ? " she asked fearfully . " I suppose so , dear , " said Mrs. Dolan , watching her husband give what she thought was an exorbitant tip to two Arab porters . " Mother , are you sure the passports arc in your bag ? " Mr. Baumberg asked his wife . A busy small man , he was unable to let time pass without some active preoccupation to worry it . When he was assured that the passports were safe he began to attend to larger and less important articles of luggage , and long after he had installed his smooth , dark , fashion . able wife in their compartment he was still fussing over possibly lost tickets or probably forgotten addresses . " I might have known that those people would be on the train , " said Mrs. Salisbury to her husband , after he had opened and shut the window several times to their mutual dissatisfaction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You might have thought they 'd leave the Holy City in peace anyway . " " I do n't see why , " said Mr. Salisbury . " They have a certain interest in it . " " It 's a place to collect one 's thoughts in , " said Mrs. Salisbury , collecting her thoughts . " Just think , Alec .. . " As the train moved off toward the orange groves Mrs. Baumberg sighed romantically . " Yerushalayim ! " she said , putting her hand on her husband 's arm . " Did you ever imagine we 'd get there , Reginald , at last ? We 're going to see it . Do you realize that we 're going to see it ? " But Rose-Marie Dolan , stationed at the window of still another compartment , found no cause for rejoicing . " Will I be expected to know everything that happened in the Holy City when we get there , mom ? " she asked mournfully . " You ought to , " said her father , Mr. Tames Dolan . " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ schools if you are n't able to teach your parents a thing or two ? " " Rose-Marie does n't need to teach me anything about the Holy City , " said Mrs. Dolan . " Thank God I 'm not a heathen like yourself , Jim Dolan . I know all I need to know . And besides , " she added confidently , " I 've got a Baedeker guidebook with maps and all the information . " " I wonder , " said Mr. Dolan , sighing heavily , " if this Allenby Hotel or whatever its name is , knows how to make a decent cocktail ? " " Jim ! " said Mrs. Dolan , scandalized . " Are you going to the Holy City to drink ? " " The Dolans and the Baumbergs , " Mr. Salisbury was saying to his somewhat ruffled wife , " will probably enjoy the whole show more than you will anyway , Helen . Their kind of religion teaches them more about such things . " " I like that , " said Mrs. Salisbury , " when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for ten years . I 'm sure neither the Baumbergs nor the Dolans ever read the Bible . After all it 's not their book  --  they do n't emphasize it the way we do . " " Well , you can go ahead and emphasize it , " said Mr. Salisbury , " only you 'd better not tell the Dolans and the Baumbergs that the book belongs to you . Seems to me I 've heard of wars in these parts for less than that . " The train insinuated itself gradually , with an intermittent but generally forward motion , into the soft brown hills of Judaea . The hours passed bare and clear outside the train , and except for that grim caravan itself the landscape bore a startling resemblance to half-forgotten , catechetical things . At least so it seemed to Rose-Marie , racking her brain for the information she was sure her mother would begin demanding before long . Rose-Marie had no faith in red guide-books , having been a scornful witness to their failure in other lands . To Mrs. Salisbury , ever-conscious of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resemble those Italian primitive paintings upon which she had once read a paper to her club . She instructedher husband in the mysteries of this resemblance , while in the next compartment , weary of his wife 's ecstasies , Mr. Baumberg went to sleep . The noisy station and the swift winding streets which took them to the hotel did not materially disturb their ideas of Jerusalem ; stations and main streets and hotels , they all told one another , were much the same everywhere . They did have time , after bathing and dressing , to walk vaguely out into the lingering day , one to a bazaar , one to the city 's walls , another merely through the tired and vocal streets . They had scarcely touched the bloom of their expected pleasures when they came together , as if by accident , in the hall of the Allenby Hotel . " I want , " said Mr. Dolan very audibly , " a cocktail . " " Sh-sh , rim ! " said Mrs. Dolan . But it was clear that her determination on this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in view of the eternal immure of punishment , to drink alcohol in the Holy City , but the incongruity of the act was no longer as striking as it had been . " Oh , well , if you must , " she said weakly , perceiving that a Nubian in a green sash and red tarbush had already taken her husband 's order with no appearance of surprise . " Only , I must say . . . " Mr. Salisbury came in and stood over them . " Just like the bar of the S.S. Wistaria , " he said jovially . " Mind if I join you ? " They did not mind ; and encouraged by Mr. Salisbury 's example , Mrs. Dolan too had a cocktail . The vast Nubian attendant was just bringing in the second round when Mrs. Salisbury and Mrs. Baumberg came into the hall from opposite directions , the first from the street and the second from the central staircase . " I 'll have a cocktail , too , I think , " said Mrs. Salisbury , sinking exhausted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from looking at rugs . " " I think , " said Mrs. Baumberg , accepting a chair and a cocktail , " that you would get them cheaper in New York . " " We walked around the city wail for awhile , " said Mrs. Dolan . " It was too charming . . . so . er .. pic-turesque . " They embarked upon fragmentary descriptions of their very tentative journeys out into the town , and the impassive Nubian attendants could have heard ( had they cared to hear ) sundry repetitions of the words " quaint " and " charming . " The cocktails cast a pleasant friendly aura around Jerusalem and its pilgrims . They were all content , and even Mrs. Salisbury and the Baumbergs got on better than they ever had since the beginning of the Mediterranean cruise . No ominous note was sounded until they all rose to go to dinner . Then , by an innocent fatality , Mrs. Dolan remarked : " We 're going to get up early in the morning to see the Holy Sepulchre . " There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to their separate tables , aware somehow that all resemblance to the bar of the S.S. Wistaria had been shattered . Definitive hostilities did not begin until the next evening at cocktail time . At this magic hour Mr. Salisbury , waiting for his wife to come downstairs , joined the Dolans and Mrs. Baumberg over the lemon-colored drinks . " What have you all been doing to-day ? " he asked . Part of the question he could have answered himself , since he had seen them all in one sanctified spot or another during the long hot hours of sight-seeing . " I spent four hours in the Church of the Holy Sepulchre , " said Mrs. Dolan soulfully , sipping her cocktail . " Such a heavenly place  --  restful and impressive . " " Yes , " said Mr. Salisbury . " I liked it . Except for having to dig up so much money . " " And being pestered to death by monks and guides , " said Mrs. Baumberg . " I do n't really see why anybody should object to giving money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Besides , it does n't cost much . " Mrs. Salisbury drifted down the stairs , elegant in a white-and-gray dress which set off her silvered hair to advantage . " What did n't cost much ? " she asked indifferently . " The Church of the Holy Sepulchre , " said Mrs. Baumberg . " Did n't cost much ? " said Mrs. Salisbury . " It was the most expensive place I 've been in since I left New York . Twenty-five cents for a wax taper every time I turned round , and I was n't allowed to keep the taper either . One for Calvary  --  two seconds , burned down less than half an inch ; one for the Holy Sepulchre and another for the Crypt of the True Cross and another one for  --  really ! All those ridiculous monks  --  Franciscans or vegetarians or whatever they are  --  seem to live by holding up the poor tourist . I ca n't see why a believing Christian should n't be allowed to look at things without having to pay through the nose for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was opening and shutting her mouth silently , like a fish , in the evident search for words adequate to the occasion . " Not to speak , " said Mrs. Baumberg , " of the look of the place . It 's Eke Roxy 's theater . " " All those jewels ! " said Mrs. Salisbury . " Really , the millions of dollars that are hung around the neck of the image of the Virgin .. . " " Good haul for some enterprising burglar , " said Mr. Salisbury speculatively . " And you call yourselves Christians ! " said Mrs. Dolan with withering contempt . " I do n't , " said Mrs. Baumberg . " I certainly do , " said Mrs. Salisbury frostily . " I consider myself a far better Christian than any of those poor benighted creatures who go crawling on hands and knees around a musty old Church , paying money to monks in order to look at a spot which is supposed to be Calvary . " " Supposed to bet " said Mrs. Dolan , suffocated . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or was the place described in the New Testament , " said Mr. Baumberg , who had just come in and ordered a Manhattan . " Or even , " he added , " that the place de-scribed ever existed anywhere . The Greek writers of the New Testament had very probably never been to Jerusalem . " " Oh , you 're going too far , " said Mr. Dolan . " There 's no reason to doubt the existence of the place unless you doubt the entire story of the Gospel . " " It 's shameful to talk like this , " said Mrs. Dolan . " If Rose-Marie were here she could answer everything you say out of the catechism . I do n't remember enough to answer you properly myself , so I refuse to discuss it . " " It is n't a matter for discussion , " said Mrs. Salisbury very coldly . " It 's a matter of taste . All those images festooned with jewelry , the awful smell of stale incense , the way every step in the place costs fifty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the ridiculous things like the hole where the Empress found the Cross , and the place where the Sacred Fire descends from Heaven every Easter , and all that . " " The Sacred Fire , " said Mrs. Dolan eagerly , " is a Greek Orthodox legend , and of course it 's absurd . " " Oh , of course , " said Mrs. Salisbury with heavy irony . " I daresay if the Protestants had the place they 'd turn it into a wooden barn , " said Mr. Dolan , who was now somewhat aroused in his lazy way . " At least they would n't make you pay to stare at a stone which is alleged to cover the burial place of your God , " said Mrs. Salisbury , now thoroughly angry . " Helen ! " said Mr. Salisbury , the peacemaker . A frozen silence had descended upon the Dolans . " Superstition ! " said Mrs. Salisbury venomously under her breath . An idea struck her husband . " Did n't I see you at the Wailing Wall a while ago @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Mr. Baumherg , " you did . A very touching spectacle , I thought . " " It seemed simply absurd to me , " said Mrs. Salisbury , who by this time was beyond concealment of her feelings . " All those dirty old women of both sexes , pounding their heads against a stone wall ! " " I must say I rather agree with you , " said Mrs. Dolan unwillingly . " There does n't appear to be much sense to it . It 's picturesque of course . " " You do n't seem to realize , " said Mrs. Baumberg , " that the place is a remnant of the Temple of Solomon  --  the only thing we have from our great past . " " But it is n't , " said Mr. Dolan . " Those lower stones are only from the Temple of Herod , not Solomon 's Temple at all . It says so in all the books . " " Books ! " said Mr. Baumberg in scorn . " What do you suppose they matter ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of the Temple of Solomon . What do guide-books matter ? " " Oh , of course if you 're going to be completely irrational , " said Mrs. Salisbury in the flood of an icy rage at all her surroundings , " what does anything matter ? The moon is made of green cheese , I suppose . " " I like that ! " said Mrs. Baumberg , powdering her nose in small , irritable dabs . " You will swallow any sort of fairy-tale that has to do with your own religion , but when it comes to a few Jewish stones you begin to split hairs . " Her metaphors seemed a trifle confused , even to herself , so she added , " You get squeamish suddenly . " " Well , of course they 're not Jewish stones , " said Mr. Salisbury philosophically . " You 've thought of that ? " " When there is n't a scrap of reliable evidence that your precious Messiah ever existed at all , " said Mr. Baumberg in a towering fury , " you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other church and pretend that here something happened or there something else happened . " He rose to his feet with the tremulous dignity of great wrath . " Miracles ! " he said witheringly . " Of course , with your sort of people . . . " said the mild little Mrs. Dolan , suddenly vixenish . " Yes , " said Mrs. Salisbury , " one knows what to expect of you . " " Education ! " Mrs. Baumberg sputtered , getting to her feet . " You might as well be African savages . " " If we were , " said Mr. Dolan , also rising , " we should not confine ourselves to saying what we think of you . " " Come , Natalie , let 's go to dinner , " said Mr. Baumberg , moving off haughtily . " Of all the . . . " Mrs. Dolan was transformed . She allowed her gaze to follow the Baumbergs for a moment , and then shifted it to the Salisburys . " You 're all alike , " she said with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two thousand years ago ; you kill Him every day with your nasty doubting minds . " White and knifelike in her anger , she made her way to the dining room . " My wife goes a little far , " said Mr. Dolan before following her , " but I want you to know that I 'm with her . " He stalked away . " Wretched , common little idolaters , " said Mrs. Salisbury . She had scarcely touched her cocktail . " Finish that drink , " said Mr. Salisbury , " and we 'll have another . " " Black ignorance , " she remarked , putting down her empty glass . " Do n't you think it 's rather silly , " her husband inquired , " for six middle-aged Americans to get into a row over a lot of old stones and .. . " " You may think so , " she interrupted , " but my religion means something to me . Think what John Calvin would have said to them ! And who 's middle-aged , any-way ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little Mrs. Dolan . " " Little Mrs. Dolan ! " she mocked . " She 's older than any of us . " This was so manifestly untrue that she did not pursue it further . " Moreover , if that 's what you call Americans . . . " she said . " Well , are n't they ? " he demanded . " They 've been Americans for at least three generations , which is about as much as we have . " " So you may think , " she said .. " But speak for yourself , not me . My maternal grandmother was a Spiggott of Philadelphia , you may remember . " " Well , " he said , vanquished by the awful ghost of the Spiggotts of Philadelphia . " do you want any dinner or are you going to quarrel all night ? " " I shall have dinner in my room , " she said , " although I do n't suppose I can eat a thing . I can not stand the sight or sound of those horrible people again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying to his wife , " you did go rather far . That fast thing you said was pretty sharp . " " I do n't care , " said Mrs. Dolan , " and if you start defending them I 'm going to bed . They 're heathens , all of them . I only said what was true . That Salisbury woman drives me mad . ' Superstition , ' she said . I heard her say it . There are some things I wo n't put up with . " " H you speak to either or any of them again , " Mrs. Baumberg said across the table to Mr. Baumberg , " you deserve to be horsewhipped . They 're living in the Dark Ages , and they 've got the manners of very badly brought-up goats . Thank God , I 'm a civilized human being or I 'd have told them what I thought of them . " In the morning a happy inspiration ( the inspiration inevitable to hotel porters on any tourist 's second day in Jerusalem ) sent them all to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and when the Baumbergs caught them up half an hour later on the road to Jericho there was a moment which even the Arab chauffeurs recognized as difficult . " I 'm not going to breathe Popish dust all the way , " said Mrs. Baumberg , and a contest ensued , at the end of which the Baumbergs ' car drew ahead , leaving at first a cloud and afterward a great deal of space in front of the enraged Dolans . The Dolans were , however , able to hold their own before the Salisburys , who came up a few minutes later ; and thus evenly spaced , the cars made their way down to the red valley of desolation . Here the utmost cleverness was demanded of their Moslem chauffeurs to keep them from meeting . Mr. Salisbury , watching these operations , admired the adroitness with which disastrous encounters were averted . " Anvbody 'd think they were used to this sort of thing , " he mused . JERUSALEM Neither at the Dead Sea nor at the place of baptism on the River Jordan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other in the streets of Jericho the event was not irremediable . Mrs. Salisbury only tied her veil tighter , Mrs. Dolan smoothed her gloves , and Mrs. Baumberg lighted an indignant cigarette . Thus segregated in their several motions like dust-djinns over the face of a desert , they whirled from sanctity to sanctity in a passion of antagonism . On the way back from Jericho the Salisbury car was entangled with a long train of camels , a caravan from Arabia making its way to Jerusalem . " The more I see of some people , " said Mrs. Salisbury darkly , " the more I think of the Mohammedans . " This seemed to her , once she had uttered it , a noble and broadminded statement ; its persuasion was such that she forgot the gnawing of dislike for awhile and was able to look at the brown-red chaos of rocks about her . The Judaean Wilderness , all bleak grandeur under a burning savage sun , was not a landscape to compose or pacify the mind , however , and Mrs. Salisbury arrived in Jerusalem more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Dolans and the Salisburys were actually in the Church of the Nativity at Bethlehem at the same time the next morning , but astute management on the part of Mr. Salisbury staved off the impending brawl . He kept his wife looking at the almost undiscernible remains of mosaics while the Dolans were absent in the subterranean crypt . When the Dolans returned to the body of the church and the coast was , he felt , clear , he accompanied Mrs. Salisbury into the dank , dark cellar which has been designated by the established religions as the birthplace of their Redeemer . Redemption would have been well-nigh impossible , he reflected , if they and the Dolans had actually met face to face in that tiny cubicle . By a special dispensation of Providence the Dolans had driven away before the Salisburys went outside to their own car , so that not even a quarrel of motors for precedence was to be feared . In the hall of the Allenby Mr. Baum-berg was walking up and down in a state of great excitement , while Mrs. Baum-berg @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an untasted gin fizz and a mounting pile of cigarette-ends decorated with bands of her dark lipstick . The Dolans , first back from Bethlehem and unwilling to notice the existence of their fellow-passengers , stalked through the hall toward the stairs . " See here , " said Baumberg , flourishing a newspaper excitedly , " Dolan , look at this . A crash in the Street . " " What 's that ? " said Dolan , taking the paper . " Universal Can down twelve points in one day , " said Baumberg . " Oh , my God , " said Mrs. Dolan feverishly , " what about Consolidated Motors ? " " My dear , " said Mrs. Baumberg in a weak voice , " you ca n't find out a thing from that paper . It does n't mention Consolidated Motors at all . " " Five columns about the Wailing Wall . . . some damned row or other , " said Baumberg , " and only a squib about whatever it is that is happening in the Street . " " Oh , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " what a place to be in ! No newspapers for weeks . Nothing but that little local rag . " " We 've got to do something , " said Dolan with decision . " It 's apparently been a bad break . But first I 'm going to have a drink . " " Me too , dear , " said Mrs. Dolan feebly . " A silver fizz . Very strong . For the last five years I ca n't hear the word crash without being sick all over . " " It may not be anything so very terrible , " said Mr. Dolan , " but the point is , how are we going to find out anything in this God-forsaken hole ? " The Salisburys came in and were greeted by Mr. Baumberg with the news . " Heavens and earth ! " said Mrs. Salisbury , sitting down very suddenly . " What does it mean ? " " There 's no way of telling , " said Mr. Dolan . " You 'd better have a drink . It may not be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear , " said Mrs. Salisbury to Mrs. Dolan , " I shall never forget last year ... " " There 's not a thing in that paper , " said Mr. Salisbury in disgust , throwing it on the floor . " All about some row or other they 're having here , and only three sentences of cable from New York  --  just enough to paralyze us . " " I know , it 's maddening , " said Mrs. Baumberg . " There 's not a newspaper this side of Cairo . " " We could cable , " said Mr. Baumberg doubtfully , " only the boat sails to-morrow night . " " The boat ! " said Mrs. Dolan . " What about the boat ? " " That 's an idea , " said Mr. Salisbury . " There 's always a lot of wireless news on the boat , Suppose we get down to the boat and keep the air busy ? " " Right , " agreed Baumberg . " There 's no hope of finding out anything here . These people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " If only I knew about Consolidated Motors ! " said Mrs. Dolan . " Mother . . . " Rose-Marie began . " Hush , child , " said Mrs. Dolan . " Go upstairs and pack your bag . We 're going back to the boat . " " We can get to Jaffa in a car in two hours , " said Mr. Salisbury . " Suppose we have dinner here and then get a couple of cars to run us down . Unless somebodywants to stay here till our time 's up . " To his last suggestion nobody paid the slightest attention . " My cousin Jack , " Mrs. Salisbury was saying to Mrs. Baumberg , " was simply wiped out last year . He had bought ten thousand shares of .. . " As the two cars , with their nervous and talkative occupants , came up the hill on the road to Jaffa , the moon rose over Jerusalem . The white-enchanted city lay silent there forever , embalmed in moonlight . The soft white sparkle of the great mosque 's dome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tomblike . The surrounding hills accepted the moon 's mystery as that same visitation would be accepted , only a few short hours later , by the chasms of Manhattan and the Place de la Bourse . The moon had been to the deserts over Jordan , where it would go again . It had shone on the tents of Bedouin in the great wastes , where camels huddled for comfort while harsh voices called to prayer . So the moon , indifferent in its ceaseless journey , absorbed strange and ever stranger prayers in the white immemorial light now soft-lying over Jerusalem . " It 's pretty , " said Rose-Marie , interrupting her elders . " Mother , are n't we going to see any more of the Holy City ? " " Hush , child , " said Mrs. Dolan . " Mr. Salisbury , do you suppose the wireless will have something about Consolidated Motors ? "
