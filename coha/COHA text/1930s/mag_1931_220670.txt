Picture " John Bull . " Now make him taller-6 ft. 6 in. tall . Swell his great girth , expand his barrel chest . Make him the biggest , handsomest , beefiest John Bull in England . Dress him in a well-cut morning coat , impeccable striped trousers and white spats . Give him a handsome cane . Crown him with a high silk hat . Make him a Knight of Justice of St. John of Jerusalem . Make him the colossal figure who merged under the British Royal Mail Steam Packet Co. the largest group of shipping companies ever created ( TIME , Feb. 23 ) . Do all this and you have Baron Kylsant of Carmarthen . <P> If this Colossus of Britain were a monstrous swindler and a mean cheat , what Court , what Law would be so mighty as to overawe or punish him ? Last week in the ancient , musty Guildhall of London , Lord Kylsant was brought to trial before a man even more impressive than himself . Without the consent of this awful man ( always readily granted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ own City of London . The Awful Man is Sir William Phen Neal , Lord Mayor of London . Sir Phen Neal is also Chief Magistrate of the City of London . In his great stiff robes , in his flowing full-bottomed wig , and adorned with his cumbrous , jingling golden chains of office , Sir Phen Neal personified last week British Justice - the world 's quickest , most impressive , best . <P> Paradoxically the case of Crown v. Kylsant is not , from a purely legal standpoint , either complex or remarkable . In lucid British fashion King 's Councillor D. N. Pritt put the case last week at Guildhall thus : " <P> What the Crown alleges is that Lord Kylsant did in 1926 and in 1927 , by a profit-and-loss account balance sheet , for the form of which we allege he was personally responsible , represent to shareholders and the world in general that in each of those two years the Royal Mail group had made large trading profits , whereas it had made serious losses . . . . <P> " One of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these two years large hidden reserves-the existence of which was perfectly proper and legitimate but which never had been disclosed to the shareholders , which is not illegitimate-were passed off as profits so as to misrepresent to the shareholders that the company was in fact earning profits in its trading . . . . <P> " We submit that the profit shown by the Royal Mail Steam Packet on the face of the accounts for 1926 is $1,776,625 . The true position , we say , including the losses in the subsidiaries , is that there was in 1926 an actual trading loss of $4,023,315 " <P> From a purely fiscal standpoint , the case promised to be most complex . Vanloads of ledgers and papers will be produced by both sides . For example , every phase of the $10,000,000 Royal Mail 5% debenture bond issue of 1928 will be minutely examined , the Crown trying to prove that this was a barefaced swindle by the Knight of Justice of St. John of Jerusalem . He sold these shares , the Crown charges , by telling the public that Royal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the debentures five times , whereas for the past seven years the Royal Mail had not earned but lost money .
