It was Coach Richard Hanley 's birthday week ; his brother was on the team ; he begged for victory . For 53 minutes his Northwesterners , unbeaten in their Big Ten games , outcharged , outkicked , held scoreless the great Notre Dame team . Twice they lost the ball inside the enemy 5-yd. line in the second period . Then , in the last period , Notre Dame 's Schwartz got away and ran 28 yards to break the tie , and a little later Notre Dame 's Dan Hanley made the score that beat Northwestern 's Hanleys+ 14 to 0 . <P> <P> Beaten by Army , Michigan , Dartmouth and Holy Cross , Harvard came back against a Yale team , which , in spite of its early promise , turned out to be merely a team against which other teams could make comebacks . Albie Booth , Yale 's much-publicized sparkplug quarterback , was stopped in his little tracks every time he hit the line . Harvard could not gain with a running game either , but Barry Wood 's punts were longer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Twice Wood dropped back and sent long flat passes to Huguley for the scores that won the game . Harvard 13 , Yale 0 . <P> <P> In the second half of its most important game , old Coach Glenn ( " Pop " ) Warner 's Stanford eleven played like nothing human , completed pass after pass , tore through California 's line as if they were playing a school team : Stanford 41 , California 0 . This week Stanford plays Dartmouth . <P> <P> Little Maryland , scheduled to play four hard games in two weeks , started their assignment with Navy and put up a smart fight though they were nosed out , 6 to 0 . <P> <P> The smallest Big Ten Conference crowd of the year watched Michigan work into a championship tie with Northwestern by handling Chicago as every good team has done , this time 16 to 0 . <P> <P> After outplaying and outsmarting Minnesota all afternoon , Wisconsin 's Badgers had marched to the 10yd. line in the last minutes of the last period when a roisterer in the stands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the crowd ran onto it . For a long time officials worked wildly trying to get people off , to finish the game . Then Wisconsin came back and lined up but Minnesota did not , so it was still Wisconsin 14 , Minnesota 0 . <P> <P> Purdue 's Van Bibber failed to kick goal after touchdown , and by the width of that point the Indiana underdogs went back to Bloomington crazy with glee . Indiana 7 , Purdue 6 . <P> <P> If John Ovelman of Illinois had blocked an Ohio State punt a shade less perfectly the ball might have stayed where he could fall on it for a touchdown , but it became a safety by bouncing over the end-zone line . Ohio State 12 , Illinois 9 . <P> <P> Every Jayhawker came to the aid of his party to win the most decisive game Kansas has ever won from Missouri , 32 to 0 <P> <P> Baylor 's line was strong enough to keep Texas Christian 's plunging backs out of the Southwestern championship they were figured to win . Baylor 35 , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the Brown second team , and held their lead when the regulars went in . New Hampshire 7 , Brown 0 . <P> <P> Villanova used an effective aerial attack over Georgetown 's head and even intercepted one of the Hilltopper 's own passes . Villanova 13 , Georgetown 0 . <P>
