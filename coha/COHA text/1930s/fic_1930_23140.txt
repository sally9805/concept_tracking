ENCARNACION A STORY BY ALICIA O'REARDON OVERBECK " S ENORA . " The voice was gentle , soft , purring , with none of the dry nasal tones of Bolivia . I was leaning on the gate of our little patio , gossiping with Min , my comrade of many camps , and I turned quickly to face the speaker . A girl stood several steps above me , on the gravel path that ran around my small garden . Against the faint ash rose of the adobe wall she was a thing of loveliness and color in her wide mauve poll era , embroidered salmon-pink shawl , high gray kid boots , and tall , glistening white Chola hat . " Senora , " she repeated  --  and a shy smile revealed white , childish teeth and a dimple in her left cheek ? " would you have need of a servant ? " As it happened , I had need , and very pressing need , of a servant at that precise moment , but somehow the charming , glowing figure before me seemed far removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ivory , with a hint of pink on the cheekbones , her round eyes were golden-brown velvet , her weak little mouth was damp and red , and her sepia hair , plaited into the regulation Chola trenzas , curled at the ends . There was nothing of the country about her save her clothes , and even these were so fresh and smart that there was a certain comic-opera quality about them . " What is your name ? " I asked , and I too found myself smiling . " Encarnaci6n , Senora , " she answered , " and I am of Aram . I have been living with my sister there  --  her husband is chauffeur for the Company . I should greatly like to work for you , Senora . " I turned to MM , and found her eyeing the girl from head to toe , tight disapproval written in every line of her face . " What do you think ? " I asked . " Think ! I do n't think . I know . Take her and you take trouble . She 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait until the boys set eyes on her . And she 's not a native , either . She 's half Gringo . Ask her . " The question to an outsider might seem rather delicate , but to a Bolivian a matter of natural or legitimate birth is a mere trifle ; so I asked briskly : " Are you a IV acioriale ? " " Si , Senora , 64 . " She nodded her head eagerly . Then her eye caught Min 's , and she hesitated . " But my papa , he was a German . " " There , " cried Min triumphantly . " What did I tell you ? That accounts for her light skin and eyes and hair . You know these half-breeds . " " She 's sort of blossomy , is n't she ? And so babyish ! If someone does n't take her in and give her a chance , what will become of her ? " " Do n't fret , it 'll become of her anyway . Why court trouble ? " EnearriaciOn 's eyes roved from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over in English and inspected her with much the same interest we might give to a chicken or a pig about to be purchased . " How old are you , EnearnaciOn ? " I asked . " I have thirteen years , Senora , " she answered . Thirteen years ! According to our standards a little girl , but according to the standards of her people a woman grown . In the little pueblo of Rosario down the valley were the chicherias , where girls even younger than this one stood in the doorways and smiled enticingly . Just across the river was au awful , toothless old woman who collected girls and rented them out rather profitably . In the native camp itself were mothers who boldly sold their girls to the highest bidder . I knew even as I spoke that I could not spare this lovely EncarnaeiOn her ultimate fate , but she was such a baby to face it now . " I think I 'll give her a trial , Min , " I said , and I felt quite as much embarrassed as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Min had her points , and we had weathered many a storm together ; but at times her obvious rightness was a little overpowering . " Well , you 'll regret it . You see if you do n't . She wo n't want to work . Look at those clothes and her smooth hands . Furthermore , it wo n't be a week before you have the boys throwing rocks on your roof and prowling around your house at all hours of the night , and you 'll probably have to go after them with a gun , just as I did when that beast of a Parades came after my Felicidad . I ? " " Oh , well , " I said hurriedly , " no harm trying it out , and at least she will be ornamental . " At the moment I felt that I simply could not listen again to the worn anecdote of the one known assault on the virtue of Min 's Felicidad . Felicidad was quite the most hopeless of Bolivia 's daughters  --  pock-marked , squint-eyed , bow-Iegged . No wonder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ornamental ! " Min rather snorted . " Well , I 've warned you . She wo n't work  --  she 's much too pretty for that  --  and she 'll cause trouble . You see . I must run along now , and see what Felicidad is doing . Hasta in vista ! " Both EncarnaciOn and I were visibly relieved at Min 's departure . She heaved a deep sigh , and the questioning smile returned to her face . " I think I 'll try you out , " I said . " What wages do you get ? " " What would it please you to give , Senora ? " " Twenty-five Bolivianos a month at first . Then , if you work hard , we 'll see . " Apparently the sum , the equivalent of about nine dollars gold , was entirely satisfactory , for she beamed and cried : " Bien , Senora , muy Here . " No use asking her what she could do . The truth was not even expected of her kind , and if I had asked her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come on , " I said , " and I 'll show you your room . " The room was nothing more than a calamina shed hung to the side of our tent house . One had to bend nearly double to enter , and there was no window . A small camp bed , a rickety washstand with a tin bowl and pitcher , a shattered table , and a chair were the furniture . The room had a hoard floor instead of the customary one of dirt , a bed instead of a bundle of rags in the corner , and a door that would lock . I noticed EnearnaciOn looking at the door with interest . " Es bonita , Senora , " she breathed . " May banita ! Linda ! " Almost too bad that anyone should consider such a hole as bonita  --  even may bonita  --  and Linda , but this was no time to haggle over aesthetics . " Where are your things ? " I asked . She pointed out the door to a large bundle wrapped in a sheet . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Unlike most native dogs , he was immaculately clean , and from under his fluffy white bang his black eyes twinkled and his wet little black nose twitched eagerly . " Is that your dog ? " " Si , Senora . " EncarriaciOn 's hands clasped and unclasped nervously , and ? her eyes were imploring . " He is most loving and intelligent and peaceful . " " You ca n't keep him in camp , " I said sternly , but at the same time carefully avoiding the earnest gaze of the small dog . " There are other dogs , and he might destroy the gardens . " " But , Senora , he is so muy caballero , is my littledog . And his name is Cazador . " Cazador ( the hunter ) , at the mention of his name , threw himself up on his small rump , and lifted his paw in a smart military salute . I looked from the girl to the dog . Both were so singularly alike  --  so clean , so young , so almost elegantly spectacular . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the side of his mouth , and he distinctly smiled . " Well , " I conceded weakly , " I suppose you 'll have to keep him . But he must not dig in the garden , and he must never enter the sala . " " Nunca , Senora . Nunca , nunca , nunca , " agreed EncarnaciOn vehemently . " Very well , " I said , and I shook Cazador 's paw and urged him to return to a more normal and easy position . " Take your things into your room , and when you get straightened out , come into the house quickly . " Min was wrong on one point . Encarnaci6n could and would work . She could polish a floor until it glittered ; she could make a bed  --  smooth and straight and taut ; she could scrub and order our shabby bathroom to the point of trimness ; she could arrange flowers and pillows and curtains until our dowdy living room came to life and glowed . She was gentle , too , and affectionate ; and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bond of real understanding . She never talked much  --  she was curiously inarticulate amongst a talkative people  --  and our conversations were confined to inquiries as to my health and her sweet , singing " Senora . " But she had my personal appearance enormously at heart , and appeared to regret my somewhat careless habits . If I were going to a party , she would powder the back of my neck so that not the leastspeck showed on the edges of my hair ; she would insist on a triangle of rouge on each cheek ; she would adjust to the last fold the dress which she had first carefully pressed . And she developed a perfect passion for running behind me and straightening the seams of my stockings , which somehow were always a little askew . As for Cazador , he quickly established himself in the heart of the household . The first morning he was in residence , he appeared with my breakfast tray , saluted politely , and helped me finish my toast . He was , as EncarnaciOn had guaranteed , muy caballero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Chevalita was the essence of discretion . He quite naturally spent the best part of his days on a small rug in front of the stove in the sala . Relations between Cazador and me were always a little formal  --  we were acquaintances rather than friends  --  and although he would eat breakfast with me and invariably treat me with perfect courtesy , he would never go walking with me nor take me into his full confidence . His patron owned his heart entire . On the other point I soon found that Min was entirely right . The boys  --  both Gringo and native  --  quickly discovered EncarnaciOn . The first Saturday night after her arrival a crowd of them came down from the mine to our base camp and , as usual , flocked into our tent for a cocktail and the gossip of the week . Among them was Jorge Ibanez , the tall , greenly pallid native accountant , who had been to the States , who spoke almost perfect English , and who was the bane of my existence . He affected Gringo ways and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choicest gatherings by his unsolicited presence ; he professed for his own people a laughing , scornful contempt . EncarnaciOn brought the tray of cocktails into the sitting room . Without her hat and shawl she was more than ever entrancing . Her soft hair curled over her low forehead , long gold earrings swung in her little pink ears , and her sloping shoulders and small waist showed to perfection in her trig , tight-fitting basque . As she entered the room there was a hush . Every man there registered his own particular form of interest . Ibafiez 's thick , lead-colored lips fell slightly open , and the heavy lids of his eyes drooped . The young mine superintendent whistled between his teeth . " Gee , " he said , " look who 's here . Where did you find it , Alicia ? " Min , sitting in the corner , cast me a triumphant smile , which quite maddened me ; and I turned on my guests with asperity . " Cuidado , Caballero , y , " I said crisply . " Cuidado . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand , only thirteen . So remember Min and her gun , and cuidadot " " You should n't tempt us , ' Licia , " snickered the mine superintendent . But our own boys were a decent lot . Sometimes they rather ran amuck , and their jokes were apt to be a bit lurid ; but on the whole they were pretty straight . Ibanez it was who troubled me  --  Ibanez with his slow , heavy stare and his loose , twitching lips . He caught my eye and came across the room to light my cigarette . " Your new maid , Senora , " he said , " she is charming -- no ? " " Yes , charming , Don Jorge , " I answered in the formal voice I reserved for intruders . " Charming -- and mine . " His insolent gaze shifted quickly from me back to Encarnaci6n . As she passed her tray she bestowed on each man her moist , sweet smile , showing little pointed teeth , and the men smiled back in frank admiration . I could gaily have killed them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Now , you see what I told you ? " I was awakened that night by the unmistakable sound of pebbles on the tin roof of EncarnaciOn 's room . I sat up quickly and called : " Encarnaci6n , EnearnaciOn ! Qui la pan ? " Without waiting for an answer , I leaped from my bed to the window , just in time to see a man 's figure flash around the corner of the tent . There was a crash , and I knew that the intruder must have tripped over my potted plants , and was probably now crouching in the shadow of the wall . As I peered into the murky blackness , the moon suddenly freed itself of a bank of cloud mist and washed the garden with ripples of cool , milky light . And the light picked out the face of Jorge Ibanez , flattened against the adobe wall , his heavy eyes alive and hating , his pendulous lips turned back from his ugly yellow teeth . For a moment we stared at each other in mute loathing . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slippers , and sallied forth to see how EncarnaciOn was taking the affair . Her door was locked , but she opened it when she heard my voice . " It was Don Jorge , Sefiora , " she whimpered . " He wanted to come in , but I did n't unlock the door . " She was clad in a straight , old-fashioned white-cotton nightie , and her thick hair lay unplaited on her shoulders . The pink in her cheeks had deepened to scarlet , and her soft , shallow brown eyes seemed darker ? more glowing . " I think , EnearnaciOn , I shall lock you in . It is better  --  no ? " She nodded , her damp red lips parted . I slept that night with the key under my pillow . On Monday morning early the men returned to the mine , and I breathed easier . But my relief was short-lived . A couple of days later MM came to tea with me , and I knew by the light in her eye that she had something on me . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ second , and nibbled politely at her toast . " Are you aware , " she asked sweetly , " that the native boys from the Oficina are running after your EnearnaciOn ? And Ibanez must have come down from the mine again . My Felicidad saw her walking up the river trail with him yes-terday , and the Sereno told the new boy who works in my garden that he has caught young Sanchez tapping at her door twice . " I wanted frightfully to say , " Damn your Felicidad ; she 's always seeing something . " Instead , I choked over a swallow of very hot tea , and as Min thumped my back she continued : " But it 's only what / told you . You remember I warned you that day she first came into camp ? " So a couple of months went by . I spoke with EncarnaciOn on the wages of sin in my halting , uncertain Spanish ; and she listened with parted lips and nods of approval . I locked her in when the boys came down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death if he allowed anyone to molest her . Then came August and the first tender hint of spring . Frail gray clouds filmed a sky , blue so long that the eyes ached with the sight of it ; a tentative flurry of rain laid the choking black dust and wooed forth tiny green shoots in the gardens ; the drooping , amemic eucalyptus trees by the camp wall revived and filled the air with their stinging , catfish odor . In the middle of the month fell the feast of the Assumption . The Assumption in our particular part of Bolivia is one of the really important fiestas . Each year a Choto is elected patron of the festivities , and he considers himself indeed blessed , even though it may take every centavo of his meager savings to finance the affair . The eura comes from the little pueblo many kilometers down the valley , christens the year 's crop of babies , and formally unites in marriage the lovers of the vicinity , who in most cases regard this benefit of clergy merely as a bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Gringo women of the camp rave helplessly because all the house servants boldly absent themselves . Directly across the camp wall , on the other side of the little river , was the small adobe capilla . On the Wednesday morning preceding the actual day of the fiesta its cracked bell rang out a summons  --  a jaunty , provocative summons that made the hair on the back of your neck crisp and sent little sparkling stabs through you . None of your Anglo-Saxon " come to church , come to church . come to church " peals , but a clarion call to dance , to drink , to love . In answer to the invitation a drum in the native village rolled , a reed pipe screamed , a blast of dynamite burst with a sickening crash ; and the fiesta was on . For four long days and nights the earth vibrated to the scuff , scuff , scuff of feet dancing on its sunbaked face ; the drums throbbed a dogged , persistent accompaniment to the pipes ' endless repetition of a single theme ; the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lady and El Senor , her Son , were carried from the chapel in procession , hailed with deafening roars of dynamite , twilled with serpentina , pelted with confetti ; then returned to the peace of their shadowed shrines  --  their little part in the drama quickly accomplished . About the drums and pipes men circled in a sort of hesitating trot  --  round and round and round , with dizzying intensity . Groups of women in brilliant pollera , s and vivid shawls clasped hands and whirled in circles  --  bright pinwheels of color against the toneless hills . Men and women arm in arm formed a long line and marched in a sort of follow-my-leader game , circling , wheeling , twisting snakewise . At night cheap German fireworks exploded and threw balls of red and blue and green into our camp . When for a few minutes the uproar stopped , the silence was vast , terrifying . During those four days EncarnaciOn worked with savage diligence . The almond-blossom pink on her cheekbones deepened , and her soft red mouth tightened a little . Each day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smallest detail , she and Cazador would huddle close together by the wall and watch the dancers somberly . She never asked to join them , and I breathed easier as each night came and I could lock the door of her room and carry the key away . With Sunday came the final outburst of the fiesta . The dynamite had given out . Men and women lay in sodden heaps on the scarred , trodden ground  --  sated with dancing and the raw alcohol they had been drinking for four days . The band still mumbled on , but in spasmodic jerks , as if the players occasionally fell into fitful sleep . And when tea time came EncarnaciOn and Cazador had vanished . I searched through our camp for them , then stood by the wall and strained my eyes for a sight of her mauve pollera among the few swaying forms still dancing to the lagging strains of the music . When darkness came , I sent the Sereno to hunt for her . " No parece , Senora , " he reported briefly when he returned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Everything was in order . The bed was smooth and neat , her clothes were hanging in the corner . The little rickety table had been turned into an altar . It was draped with cheap lace and adorned with a huge pink bow . A gay lithograph of the Virgin in a garish gilt frame stood in the center , before it a cracked cup full of pansies , and on either side candles stuck on saucers with their own grease . On the floor in front of the altar was a small pillow , still dented with the imprint of knees . All day Monday I awaited the return of EnearnaciOn . On Tuesday morning Pepita , my laundress , tottered in . She was frowzy and soiled , and her little felt hat  --  insignia of the Indian  --  was tilted recklessly on one eyebrow . " You have returned , " I remarked haughtily . " I have returned , Senora . " An outrageous leer disclosed her toothless jaws , and cracked tiny channels in the dirt of her face . " For five days and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but when the fiesta is over I return to my Senora . And Enearna , ciOn ? " " I do n't know , " I said fretfully . The pretty , childish face had a troublesomeway of popping up before my eyes and disturbing me . Pepita removed her hat from her tousled head , and hung it on its accustomed nail . " I shall now wash my clothes , " she announced virtuously . " She also will return . " I suspected that the old devil knew where Encarnaci6n was , but I did not ask her . She would probably not tell the truth , and I had no way of forcing the girl to return anyway . That day at lunchtime one of the men from the Office stopped at my gate . " Your pretty EncarnaciOn  --  has n't she been raising hell ? " be grinned . " EnearnaciOn ! Where is she ? " " Over at the Office right now , standing up in a corner bawling her head off . It seems young Ibanez found her at the fiesta on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's had her locked up there ever since . The Sereno heard Cazador whining and reported it to the Office . Say , the Old Man 's in a swell rage over it . You know the rules about bringing women into camp . Well , he says Ibanez 's got to marry the girl or out of camp they both go . I call it nerve , this talk of marrying . Ibanez comes of a good family . Of course , he says he 'll be damned if he 'll marry any . Well , you know what he 'd call the kid . So this afternoon out they go . Say , Min 'll have one on you . " Something hot and savage turned me nearly blind , and I wanted to lean across the gate and smear the silly grin off the man 's face with a clawing band . Instead , I said rather thickly : " ToO bad ! You fellows never gave the poor kid a chance  --  did you ? " And I turned and walked into my door . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " EncarnaciOn , Senora . " She was dirty and bedraggled . Her mauve skirt was torn and stained , her face was distorted with weeping . Cazador , matted and dusty , cringed at her side . " Senora , " she said softly , and her dry , swollen lips twisted into a cracked smile . " EncarnaciOn , " I answered blankly . Cazador drew near and laid a timid paw in my lap . " You must go , " I cried desperately . " You must go and now . The Gerente is very angry . He says you can not stay in camp . " " But at the fiesta , Senora , they made me very drunk , and when I woke up I was in the tent of Don Jorge  --  locked in . And where can I go , Senora ? " Hesitatingly and with a feeling of sick revolt I tried to explain to the girl what I did not well understand myself  --  her sin against a society that had never given her a running chance , the reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes never left my face . " I shall go , " she said flatly , and she stumbled from the room , Cazador slinking close to her torn mauve skirt . I had stood enough for one day . Swiftly and in abject fear of meeting my comrade Min , I left the house and climbed unhappily up the steep trail that led away from camp . The pulsing hum of spring was in the air . A couple of little green birds scolded and fussed over their housekeeping arrangements in a twisted bush ; a snow-white lamb quavered after its indifferent mother with trembling , new-born legs ; a pair of amorous llamas threw back their heads and regarded me with scarifying disdain . When I reached the little ledge where I was wont to retire from a distasteful world , I sat down and gazed unblinkingly down the river path . Presently around the curve emerged a small , slight figure  --  a figure somewhat bent beneath a bundle swung on its back . By its side padded a white dot that was a dog . The two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ followed I met Encarnaci6n on the trail . Her step had regained its spring , her clothes were gayer than ever . Cazador , washed and combed to a woolly whiteness , always accompanied her . Our greetings were restrained and invariably the same . " Senora , " she would breathe softly . " EncarnaciOn , " I would reply . And we would pass on our separate ways . Then the rains came in earnest . Day after day a flat , leaden sky hung low over our heads , scudding banks of clouds raced up the valley , the river rose and cut off our source of supplies . Late in November came a short respite  --  hours of thin , uncertain sunshine alternated by smashing showers with thunder that roared and blared amongst the mountains like a mighty battle . And always Pepita and I kept an eye on the steep river trail , hoping for a sight of the first sad little gray head that would mean a burro train had forded the angry stream and was bringing up potatoes , green vegetables , eggs , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon slowly over the crest of the hill emerged a straggling procession  --  a litter carried by four Indians , and around it a milling crowd of men , women , children , and dogs . Pepita gave an appreciative cluck . " A death , Senora ? " she queried gloatingly . " Who knows ! Perhaps it is but an enfermo being brought up from Rosario to the hospital . However , you may go and see , " I added . She pulled her shawl over her head and dashed over the little foot bridge that led to the native village , with a speed that belied her own account of her age  --  either forty-five or seventy-six , she could not quite remember which . The straggling cavalcade , augmented now by the people from our village , crawled painfully up the last cruel pull to the small calamina hospital owned by the Company . I watched Pepita bound up the hill behind it , close in on it , work her way to the side of the litter . Ten minutes later she stood beside me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shining , the hairs on a large mole on her chin bristling with excitement . " Senora , " she gasped , " it is EncarnaciOn ? Avis Maria , EncarriaciOn , Senora ! It is terrible  --  most terrible . She is cut  --  cut in many places . There is blood  --  blood everywhere . Her legs , her side , her arms , her face  --  cut in seven parts . One ear , Senora  --  gone , quite gone . And both her trenzas cut completely off . " Pepita held out between her thumb and forefinger one of her own thick , long-lobed ears and clutched at her untidy pigtails to demonstrate the horror of the situation . In an instant a blossomy , child 's face swam before my eyes , and I steadied myself against the wall . " But , Pepita , not EnearnaciOn ! Surely not EncarnaciOn ! " " Si , Senora , Enearnaci6n . And she will surely die , for has she not been most wicked ? " Pepita blew her nose fervently on the hem of her skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inarticulate triumph  --  the triumph of age frustrated over youth too frustrated . " Par Dios , did she not take from another woman her man ? And the woman , with the child of the man in her belly , meets EncarnaciOn in the plaza of Rosario , and she says , Give me back my man . ' And EnearnaciOn laughs , and says , ' Why do n't you keep your man ? I do n't want him . ' And the woman pulls a knife from under her shawl , and she cuts and cuts and cuts , and EncarnaciOn falls on the ground , and Cazador tries to save her , and he gets cut also , and then the men come and pull the woman off . And now EncarnaciOn is at the hospital about to die . Jesiis , what will become of her soul ? " Pepita acted each incident of the ghastly drama . She was the woman , she was Enearnaci6n , she was Cazador , snarling and lunging at my legs . " I must go at once to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Felipa , the young native nurse , ran down the hill and into camp . " Senora , the Doctor asks you to do him the grand favor of coming to the hospital at once . La EraearnaciOn calls and calls for you , and she will surely die in a little time . " Papa 's face was smoky blue , and her pale lips quivered nervously . She and EncarnaciOn had been friends . I ran up the steep trail , my heart pounding under my ribs , pushed my way through the crowd in front of the hospital , and met the Doctor at the door . " She wants to see you , " he said briefly . " It 'll be over in a few minutes . It is n't even worth while taking off her clothes . She 's hacked to a fare-you-well . " We stepped into the tiny hospital ward . On the bed nearest the door was a huddled mound of dirty , bloody clothes ? slim gray kid boots with silk laces and tassels at the top , a mauve skirt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a head so swathed in bandages that nothing showed but a tiny circle of face with long brown lashes lying on the waxen , yellow skin . At the foot of the bed crouched Cazador , dyed scarlet with blood  --  scarlet like the sins of his mistress . He whined when he saw me , and sidled closer to an edge of skirt that hung to the floor . The Doctor and I stood on either side of the bed , watching the still form , listening to the quick , painful breathing . " God ! " said the Doctor softly , " the pity of it  --  the waste of it . But it was inevitable . She was headed for this from the minute she was born , with her Indian mind and her Gringo soul and her beautiful body . She never had a ghost of a chance . " As he finished speaking , the long lashes lifted . EncarnaciOn was looking at me , and in her brown-velvet eyes was neither fright nor pain  --  only a sort of numbed puzzlement . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but her voice was roughened and dry . I bent over her and took her cold , sweaty hand , and she seemed casting about in her slow , inarticulate way for some word . Then a shadow of her old smile crinkled the corners of her eyes , and I stooped low to catch the stumbling whisper . " Adios , " she said . " Adios , Senora rata. "
