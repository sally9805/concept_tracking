A FEW weeks ago , when three little girls were found dead under a blanket on a Pennsylvania mountainside , the New York Herald Tribune carried a news story of the event which gave an impressive picture of modern life . In an attempt to identify the dead , the police were checking dozens of stories that were being told to them every day . And it seemed to them that almost all of the United States must be on the move . An astonishing number of families with three daughters were reported migrating , by bus or car , from California to Florida ; an equally astonishing number of mothers wrote in that they had , indeed , three daughters making a trip with their father , who might very well have killed them  --  these mothers being about equaled by the number of fathers who were just as confident that their three daughters , away from home with their mother , could have been similarly done away with . This seems to be a new search for some frontier paradise . The trek was formerly westward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mississippi , beyond the Rocky Mountains . These lands are no longer strange , and the Fountain of Youth and Joy which Ponce de Leon once looked for in Florida does not seem to spring in them . Those who sought Utopia somewhere in the direction of the Pacific Ocean have turned back , perhaps to see if they might have missed it on the way . BUT of course modern life is not solely made up of this sort of restless and futile wandering . As an obvious contrast the Drifter offers the little Ontario community which the quintuplet sisters have made famous . New York has been lately honored by a visit from their physician , the very picture of the honest , composed , straightforward country doctor who is not above a little joke now and then , and who has no wish , once he has calmly looked over the metropolis , but to return to the life of bard and financially unremunerative labor which has engaged him for twenty-five years . Dr. Dafoe was modestly inclined to give most of the credit for the quintuplets ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In giving birth to five babies at once , he explained , Mrs. Dionne was merely keeping up the community average , since she had been married ten years and had only six children . " Families run ten or twelve there , " the doctor said , " and we have one of twenty-two , all living . They have a very low infant mortality rate , too . " To the doctor the fact that the entire community is living on a dole from the Canadian government  --  which pays him a salary , too , since his patients are unable to afford a feeseems a little irrelevant . And certainly from their pictures the eleven Dionne children look rather handsome and not in the least undernourished or wretched . THE Drifter does not wish to draw hasty conclusions from these two examples of living today . He will merely point out that the inhabitants of Callander , Ontario , probably do not possess a radio among them ; they are strangers to electricity , the telephone , the vacuum cleaner , the mechanical orange-juice extractor , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet occurred to them to start off in search of Utopia . The perplexing complications of modern life , being quite unknown , do not disturb them . Unfortunately the Drifter can not recommend to his perplexed readers that they move to Ontario and live the simple life . It would not suit them ; and they would be almost certain to be the parents of only one baby at a time , which would therefore have to be cared for in the family nursery instead of in a special hospital with two nurses , a housekeeper , and an orderly . The only solution of this problem is never to leave home , for once you , or your grandparents , start out after Utopia you are condemned to perpetual wandering . You are , in fact , a DRIFTER Correspondence LI7e print below a new collection of letters discussing Mark Granite 's proposal for a United Liberal Party published in The Nation for December 5.1 In Hearty Accord To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : I have just read Mark Granite 's letter in The Nation of December 5 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forth . I consider his statement that " Franklin D. Roosevelt is to be found in first one camp and then the other or on the fence between them and , sometimes , with his marvelous mental and political agility , in all three positions at once , " the best thing I 've read about Mr. Roosevelt since the advent of the New Deal . It seems to me that a United Liberal Party is needed in the United States , although the " kept " avenues of information make the organization of such a party a herculean task . However , the American Circle , as a national committee of correspondence , does offer some kind of way out . In enabling private citizens all over the country to take counsel together it provides something which is greatly needed . I would say that what is needed before a Liberal Party is the means of getting information to the public . As a newspaperman I know that the press is hopeless in this respect . The radio offers possibilities , but the press refuses to criticize the radio monopoly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instrument of public opinion . Chicago , December 4 J. A. SMITH A Liberal Program TO THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : Mark Granite 's letter in the December 5 issue of The Nation is timely . If the moment was ever at hand for a new party , it is here now . While the Old Guard is headless and in confusion is the time to organize and build a sound , forward-looking Liberal Party . This party will attract liberal elements in all old and new national and State parties ; Minnesota , Wisconsin , California , Washington , Oregon , Montana , Louisiana , and other States are all forming , or have formed , new State parties which are looking for national leadership . Will it come or must the movement collapse like its predecessors ? " What have we to look forward to ? Nothing if we sit idly by while reaction crystallizes on one hand and radicalism on the other . Will it be the old story of the liberals crushed , as in Russia , Germany , and Italy ? Let us hope not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a new Liberal Party , and let it come out for the following : 1 . Unemployment insurance , old-age pensions , and health protection . 2 . High income and inheritance taxes . 3 . Complete federal supremacy in all social and economic legislation . 4 . Self-sustenance for the unemployed . 5 . Real freedom of the press . 6 . Redistribution of income through control of profits and high wages . 7 . Adequate protection of the consumer through the Bureau of Standards . 8 . Federal aid to education . 9 . Tariff reduction to control prices so that the consumer is not robbed of all that he earns . 10 . Referendum on wars primarily for aggression outside the bounds of our country . 11 . Government ownership of munitions . 12 . Heavy tax on war profits . Spooner , Wis. , December 3 KENNETH KELLETT Mark Granite 's United Liberals would inevitably attract the very elements  --  deluded workers and intellectuals  --  which sought expression in the movements to which he refers so contemptuously . Liberalism grew up in an economy of scarcity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yearnings  --  the cry of the dying American middle class . Mark wants better distribution , not in the economist 's sense , but " a better distribution of freedom , security , equality , and opportunity . " The phrase might have been lifted bodily from the " Challenge to Liberty . " Such yearnings are even more vague and utterly meaningless now than when they were mouthed by the " old populist , inflationist , quack-remedy elements . " The United Liberals would indeed have to be " financial witch doctors " to bring back the days when there really was some semblance of equality of opportunity . History has proved that middle-class revolt under these conditions tends to become fascist . I can see the United Liberals , the " old populist , inflationist , quack-remedy element " having duly climbed aboard , whooping it up for God , country , and Mark Granite . We shall then have been delivered even more firmly than before into the hands of Mr. Gerard 's fifty-odd men . In the era of abundance it is nothing short of criminal to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their salvation lies in the formation of another mildly liberal party . Let Karl Marx speak . " They ought not to forget that they are fighting with effects , but not with the causes of these effects ; that they are retarding the downward movement , but not changing its direction ; that they are applying palliatives , not curing the malady . " Canton , Ohio , December 5 CLARENCE K. MARZ Liberalism ? Not Socialism Let Karl Marx Speak ! To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : Mark Granite 's letter suggesting the formation of a United Liberal Party intrigues me chiefly because of the smug , self-satisfied air he assumes in dismissing from it beforehand " the old populist , inflationist , quack-remedy element . " The aloof way in which he conceives of his " real Liberal Party " to be somehow intellectually superior to them amuses me . The lifeblood of every new political party or reform movement in America has been composed of such people ; nor does his pet project differ fundamentally from those in which they appeared . From the beginning , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feeling that we were all in the game together and let the best man win . We never had feudal barons or the class of exploited serfs that went with them . We began as a nation of small proprietors , and because the expansion of the country was concomitant with the development of capitalism and its recurrent crises , most of them have now been duly manufactured into either employer or employee . The " populist , inflationist , quack-remedy " movements , including the projected United Liberals , register the death cries of the small proprietors . Free Soilers , Know Nothings , Single Taxers , Bellamyites , Populists , Bryanists , Mugwumps , Bull Moosers , La Follette Progressives , followers of Epic , Townsend pensioners , the Radio Priest , and all the adherents of forgotten movements which Mark Granite so haughtily stigmatizes as quacks are indicative of something fundamental in American life . These movements are the expression of the American worker 's unconscious and mistaken identification of his interests with those of the rapidly disappearing middle class  --  a class which does not realize what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have capitalism reformed and perpetuated so that it may continue its exploitations . To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : I hope those active in the germination of the new Liberal Party will draw a clear distinction between socialism and liberalism . The basic idea of liberalism is liberty . This means socialization of whatever can only be managed as a monopoly , and the destruction of monopoly into genuinely competing units wherever this is feasible . One enemy  --  private monopoly , unsocialized monopoly  --  but two allies  --  socialization and real competition . So to allow anyone to reduce us to the first ally alone is to accept an enormous and gratuitous handicap in the fight against private monopoly . Besides , even governmental monopoly is still dangerous if not balanced by areas of competitive freedom . Thus liberalism has one absolute end : destroy monopolistic privilege ; and two relative ends : socialize basic services but also preserve the more successful examples of competitive struggle so that government can not become an oppressive octopus , and so that efficiency and adjustment will not be entirely dependent upon conscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ short enough of knowledge and leadership ) but will be partly effected also by the free market mechanism . Chicago , December 5 CHARLES HARTSHORNE Keep Flexible ! TO THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : I 'll join Mark Granite 's new Liberal Party with certain provisos , chiefly that it is n't and ca n't be gobbled up by any self-seeking group , and that it can have some prospect of immunity against congealing around fixed ideas . To have any vitality and usefulness a new Liberal Party must be constantly flexible . I declined joining John Dewey 's league , not because I was out of sympathy with its general purposes , but because it started out with a set " platform . " There is no object whatever in starting a new party if its structure is based on a cast-iron frame , or if it can be captured by any self-perpetuating group . It is immaterial how good and holy we now may think the frame to be . The best thought , and that is what I assume any new Liberal Party will try to consolidate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ step in a never-ending march . Conclusiveness , cocksureness , is mental death . The only thing we can hope to be right in is that the direction is toward the goal . The problem is weighty but perhaps not altogether insoluble . Go slow . Start , it may be , by forming localized groups for the consolidation of ideas and the spread of those ideas to others . Work out some form of representative concentration . Let some final representative body formulate plans for approval ; but do everything to keep ideas fully circulating . I should say , never compose a platform that has about it any intimation of finality ; and move heaven and earth , if that be required , to keep all local organizations fully alive to the fundamental importance of keeping free from domination in any form . Los Murales , December 7 JAMES T. BARKELEW We Need an Anchor To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : As a reader of The Nation I am intensely interested in the development of a new political party . Such a party has been needed for some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain . It could be so created as to draw together all the differing opinions of those whose voices have had no expression whatever in the creation of public opinion in a national sense . Such a new party would prove to be a powerful force toward needed reform . Many of our American citizens are at present awaiting an anchor . Let us have the United Liberal Party . Detroit , December 5 W. H. GORDONorganized . But in the impending chaos those who profess a hope for the betterment of conditions and decline to take advantage of every possible aid are not only playing false to the future ; they evince a high degree of unintelligence . New York , December 8 LOUIS JOHNSON " Over Goes the Apple-Cart ' To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : Time is short . The forces of fascism are now praying for the failure of the New Deal in order that they may ride in on the wave of reaction they hope will sweep the country . In spite of an aroused public feeling we must assuredly swing to the right and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consolidate and that quickly . Why wait , Mark Granite ? Call together those men whom you feel are strong enough in their own right , who are respected by the working people of the nation , and who can lead and organize . Draw out of them a simple , direct , practical program . Make it dear enough for the common man to understand , phrased in a way to catch his devotion , real enough so that he may know how it will affect him as a worker . Then carry the news of it into the smallest hamlet in the land . Organize committees of correspondence , arouse the people to the same pitch that Sam Adams aroused them to just before the War of Independence , and preach continually through these committees the simple story of the new party platform . And then what will you have ? Nothing but the same dissension and argument one sees now in the minor parties of this country . I believe there is no solution . Events will crowd in one on the other , first a swing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out and preparing to get in ; another in and compromising so as not to be thrown out ; the worker always the goat . Then at last when he is convinced that he has had enough , over goes the apple-cart and we have a revolution . Kendal Green , Mass. , December 7 FRED WALE Organize Our Discontent To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : Mark Granite 's American Circle is but one more indication of a growing conviction that there is something wrong with the American social structure and that it can be remedied this side of the Kremlin . This belief has found expression in the Utopians , in Father Coughlin 's People 's Lobby , and in any number of smaller groups organized during the past few years . All of them have the same aims , the only dividing line being the minor details and methods of action . Of similar mind is a body of people who are both unorganized and innumerable , and who have the same desire to do something . However , the only indication of their attitude is either an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will turn out all right . They take no active stand for any one of the following reasons : ( 1 ) they are oppressed by the fact that their individual efforts have no perceptible effect ; ( 2 ) they are too much engaged in making a living and in their spare time trying to grab a few moments of pleasure from life ; ( 3 ) any effort toward social improvement would imperil their livelihood ; ( 4 ) they have a psychological timidity about asserting their beliefs . Could not this group act together on specific measures , outside organizational platforms ? There are any number of weapons open to them  --  the vote , boycott , persuading friends , and so on . I may be incredibly naive to suppose such a group could be Yellow Journalism in Syracuse To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : " Drive All Radical Professors and . Students from University , " shouted the headlines of the Syracuse Journal , Hearst newspaper , on Thursday , November 22 . Launching a typical Hearst red-scare campaign to boost circulation in a dull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Syracuse University to interview Professor John N. Washburne , head of the Department of Educational Psychology . They posed as prospective students at the university  --  alert young men interested in the tenets of communism and anxious to visit Soviet Russia . A garbled account of their interview with Dr. Washburne which came out in the Journal said he admitted being a Communist . The next day the Journal printed an interview with another university professor , Herman C. Beyle , of the School of Citizenship . Dr. Beyle demanded an interview with Harvey Burrill , editor of the Journal . When Burrill asked which shade of red he was , the professor retorted with the question , " What hue of yellow is your journalism ? " But somehow or other this last remark failed to find its way into the Journal report of the interview . Dr. Beyle asked for a stenographer to take down his conversation verbatim , but he was nevertheless falsely quoted . Whereas he told Mr. Burrill , " I teach no isms , " the Journal of November 23 printed his statement as " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well-known head of the Bureau of Public Relations at the university , pointed out that the public would refuse to take such accusations seriously . The Daily Orange , campus paper , added its word of ridicule and scorn to those of Dr. Johnson . ( The Journal had offered to pay this paper if it would publish an article favorable to the Journal . ) The attack of the Journal continued on Saturday , November 24- : " Keen interest aroused throughout Central New York by frank discussion in the Journal of communistic tendencies among some Syracuse University students and faculty members brought wide approval today from leaders of various Syracuse patriotic societies . " The usual blasts followed from the trumpets of the American Legion and its auxiliary , which so frequently sound at the behest of the Hearst press and the War Department . Six other professors were added to the list of those to be examined , among whom were Dr. Floyd . Al'port , leading social psychologist of America , and Dr. Burges Johnson . On the day after the Journal put the matter up to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a circulation drive , which was obviously the immediate motive of the red-hunt . ( It is encouraging to report that some people canceled their subscriptions and that the Journal lost some advertising . ) Such stunts are primarily money-making propositions for Hearst newspapers , but they also constitute a serious menace to freedom of speech . Syracuse , December 5 ALBERT V. FOWLER Man 's Inhumanity to Man To THE EDITORS OF THE NATION : When I was in Prague in August I talked at length with Frau Erich Muhsam , wife of the Nazi-murdered , Socialist-pacifist writer , who had just crossed the border , a refugee from the land of her birth . Your readers are aware , of course , of the announcement from Berlin early in July to the effect that Erich Muhsam had " committed suicide " at the Oranienberg concentration camp . Needless to say , this was a lie ! Erich Muhsam had told his wife never to believe that he would take his life . He suffered unbelievable torture in the camp . On one occasion when Frau Muhsam visited him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had lost his hearing . He had been " boxed " by the SA guards . Another time he was painted up grotesquely  --  red face and black Kaiser moustache  --  and sat against a wall . " There , we have made him pretty for you , " the guards told his wife . She fainted . Later , she found both his thumbs broken as punishment for asking permission to write to her . After June 30 the SA guards at the camp were replaced by the black-shirt secret police . Frau Miihsam took advantage of this shift and sought to lift the bait against her visits to her husband . She was granted a ten-minute interview on Sunday , July 8 . The following Wednesday she was informed by the police that her husband had " committed suicide . " Here is the story which has come out of the camp from comrades close to Miihsam : Muhsam was called to the Commander 's headquarters on July 9 . " Well , " said the Commander , " how long do you intend to live , Erich Miihsam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Muhsam answered . To which the Commander replied : " If you do not make an end of it within two days we will help you do so . " Muhsam went back to his quarters and distributed his belongings among his comrades . In the evening at seven o'clock he was again summoned by the Commander . He never returned and the following day his comrades found his body in the washroom  --  hanging by the neck . The local medical authorities refused to issue a certificate of suicide ! I have just heard that Frau Mfihsam is now in Paris , penniless . She has been living with friends here and there , first in Prague and now in Paris . Paris is overcrowded with refugees with no means of support and with no possibility of finding work ; relief agencies are closing their doors to refugee applicants or advising them to return to Germany ! May I call your readers ' attention to Frau Millisam 's situation with a plea for funds to help her readjust herself and carry on ?

" The Journal points out that it has not yet made such a computation for the twelve months of 1934 . The estimate of $6,340,000,000 was made by Middleton Black , an associate of Colston E.
