Not only the hustings but U. S. history seemed to be in Franklin Roosevelt 's mind as , in his ten-car , air-cooled special train , he rolled westward out of Washington last week . Politician Roosevelt was out to whoop it up for his supporters in this autumn 's Congressional elections . At the same time Statesman Roosevelt , midway of his second and ( perhaps ) last term as U. S. President , was out to impress his name yet deeper in The People 's memory . Until Congress adjourned , polls of public opinion had shown New Deal popularity on the wane-not Franklin Roosevelt 's personal appeal , but his methods and policies . His obvious job was to persuade the nation to look upon his works as statesmanlike achievements . <P> The 150th anniversary of the establishment of American civil government in the Northwest Territory at Marietta . Ohio , offered him an occasion , reeking with history , to hang a large historical backdrop behind the little political maneuvers of this trip . He did so with one of his analogies between the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , new opportunity " and the F. D. R. frontier of social and economic security . Said he : <P> " . . . Under new conditions , the American people as a whole nation , the original thirteen States and all the West and South that has grown out of them , is on a mental migration , dissatisfied with old conditions , seeking like the little band that came to Marietta , to create new conditions-of security . " <P> Speaking at Louisville , Ky. he dwelt on flood control in similar statesmanlike perspective : ' ' When I went to Washington nearly six years ago , I found that there were many different agencies . . . dealing with disasters . . . but there was no coordination between them . That flood last year on the Ohio and the Mississippi gave me an opportunity to test out the new machinery which I created . . . . <P> " It is another proof of the necessity of planning , and a lot of people laugh about all the planning that we are doing in Washington . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of many examples-in the long run , we will save hundreds of millions of dollars by planning for the future . " In Bowling Green , he summoned up the spirit of the era of Roosevelt II : " You can not compare the conditions of 1932 with the conditions of 1938 . I sort of sense a deep understanding , a human happiness in the hearts and in the minds of the great majority of Americans , a happiness that this country is surviving under a democratic form of government . " <P> But while history embellished , it was not supposed to conceal , the hustings . Election of the men he wants was Franklin Roosevelt 's immediate mission . Along his way , Senators and would-be Senators crowded close , competing to enjoy the magic of his aura , the salvation of his smile . <P> In Ohio , they were Senator Robert Johns Bulkley and oldtime George White . As the National Democratic Chairman of 1920 ( when Franklin Roosevelt ran for Vice President ) , Mr. White was entitled to a seat beside the President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nod : " The cavalry captain of the old days who protected the log cabins of the Northwest is now supplanted by legislators , men like Senator Bulkley , toiling . . . .
