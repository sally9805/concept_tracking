Having brought back alive three Komodo dragons from the Dutch East Indies ( TIME , May 21 , 1934 ) , two young Harvardmen and amateur naturalists . William Harvest Harkness Jr . of Manhattan and Lawrence T. K. Griswold of Quincy , Mass. , set out in the autumn of 1934 after still rarer game-the giant panda of western China . No white man had ever seen this curious creature until a French missionary chanced on one in the late 19th Century . First white men to shoot one were Theodore Jr . and Kermit Roosevelt , in 1929 . No giant panda had ever been brought out alive . <P> When Sportsmen Harkness &; Griswold reached China early last year , the Government refused them permission to enter the giant panda 's wild , bandit-infested habitat . Alone , Harkness boarded a Shanghai train at Nanking , vanished . Fortnight later , a U. S. Marshal found him in a Shanghai hotel , registered under an assumed name . <P> He explained that he was trying to forget his bitter disappointment at not being allowed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. District Attorney every three days . Next news of William Harkness reached the U. S. nearly a year later . He had died , aged 33 , in a Shanghai hospital , of cancer of the throat . <P> Sportsman Harkness ' wife , a painter , had stayed home in Manhattan when he went to China . When she heard of his death , she at once resolved to attempt what he had tried and failed . With a young Chinese guide , she left Shanghai last September , went 1,500 miles up the Yangtze River into Szechwan Province . <P> From Chengtu last fortnight Hashed a message tantalizing to every zoologist in the world . It said that Mrs. Harkness had just arrived from the Tibetan border with a live panda . If it was only a panda , her catch was of no consequence . The panda -a small , bushy-tailed , raccoon-like creature-had often been captured before . <P> But if it were a giant panda , an entirely different animal , she had a scientific prize of first magnitude . <P> Last week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a giant panda , a six-week-old female 16 inches long , weighing 4 Ib. 12 oz . To capture it , Mrs. Harkness had spent $20.000 . She hoped to sell it to a U. S. zoo for $15,000 . But just as she was about to take it aboard the U. S.-bound Empress of Russia , Chinese customs officials seized it on the grounds that she had obtained no export permit . In near-hysteria Mrs. Harkness spent the night in the Shanghai customs house , nursing her precious cub from a bottle while the Empress of Russia sailed without her . After friends had helped her post a large cash bond , customs officials permitted Mrs. Harkness to take the baby giant to her hotel , suggested payment of an export tax of $150 Mexican ( $45 U. S. ) . Then , just as she had given up hope , the huffy officials consented to let her take her rare prize home on the President McKinley . <P> About the size of a black bear , weighing 200 to 300 Ib. , the giant panda has long , creamy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black circles around its eyes , cat-like feet . It eats bamboo shoots . Natives call it beishung ( white bear ) and scientists call it Ailuropus melanoleucus . So scarce is it that when the Roosevelts shot theirs , inhabitants of the nearest village , 25 miles distant , had never seen or heard of such a creature .
