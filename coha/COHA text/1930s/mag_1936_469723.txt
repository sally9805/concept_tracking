HOWEVER the Landon boom may affect other Americans , we Kansans are excited by it . That is only natural . Any group of people whose normal attitude toward the rest of the country is a compound of an intense local patriotism and a smarting memory of past ridicule would be excited and pleased when their governor is talked of as a possible nominee for the presidency . But as the boom swells up no one knows as well as we do what a remarkable lot of nonsense is caught up along with the truth in it . In the first place we , better than anyone else , know that Governor Landon is no " Kansas Coolidge " either personally or officially . Coolidge was shaped by the New England farm , Landon by the Midwestern oil industry . He is no spendthrift and believes as much as Coolidge ever did in cutting the coat according to the cloth . ample . Coolidge , if we can believe the anecdotes , was a taciturn , rather dour individual who watched his dimes and quarters . No such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk with them , and as the son of an independent oil producer , grew up with spending money in his pocket and in a business group noted for its easy spending . He himself has been steadily successful in his business of puncturing the shaggy hillsides of Eastern Kansas . He operated conservatively and so neverknew the terrific reverses the wild-catter sometimes meets . He married a woman with a comfortable little fortune in her own name . Consequently , money of and for itself has newr meant much to him , for the same reason that water and air do not mean much to most Americans . He has always had plenty of it , but not so much that it was a nuisance . The contrast between the two men as officials is just as sharp but curiously reversed . Coolidge was in office during a boom time which both the garden and conservatory varieties of economists were pronouncing a New Era . The Coolidge talk of economy charmed everyone as something pleasantly reminiscent of a niggardly childhood . It was so charming that few noticed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miscellaneous expenses of the government were steeply rising . Landon came to office in the terrible month of January , 1933 . The next year the worst of all the long line of droughts which have plagued the plains States lay hard over Kansas . Last year the drought broke in the eastern part of the State , but the wheat belt suffocated in the dust storms . In 1934 the corn crop was only a tenth of its average for the five preceding years ; at the same time wheat production dropped from a five-year average of 176,000,000 bushels to 79,000,000 , and in 1935 further shrank to less than 60,000,000 . The official cloth Coolidge had to work with was gorgeously ample , and the civil expenses rose . Landon 's cloth has been so scant that only the most careful scheming and skimping would make it do at all . Consequently , governmental expenses have been sternly trimmed . The per capita cost of Kansas State and local government came down from $67.35 in 1932 to $51.32 in 1934 . The two men faced entirely different sets of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pure nonsense to talk of a Kansas Coolidge . Just as misleading is the talk about balancing the Kansas budget . The men who framed the Kansas constitution seventy-five years ago began that job by forbidding the State ever to contract a debt aggregating more than a million dollars or to make any new appropriation without levying a specific tax to cover it . For this , as for many other of the celebrated peculiarities of the State , we may thank the New Englanders who came out in emigrant trains to make another " free State . " At the time Kansas was admitted to the Union a number of States had been running scandalously into debt , and the careful New Englanders were determined that this should not happen in any State they had the shaping of . During the years the fiscal policy they set up has been developed but not changed . What was done under Landon 's leadership was the forcing of the local taxing units , some 8,000 of them , to fund their existing indebtedness and proceed thereafter on a cash basis . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and , perhaps most important of all in the long run , every taxing unit was forced to adopt a standardized method of bookkeeping so as to make possible a close accounting supervision . This was a step toward centralized government which was bitterly opposed by many county , city , and school employees . Because tax collections shrank in Kansas as elsewhere during those dreadful years , the cash-basis law worked a real hardship in many localities and to many of the people who didthe State 's work . In 1934 , for instance , the average annual salary for men teachers in one-teacher schools was $451 and for women $441 . During the past winter common labor on the highways has averaged only $60 to $75 a month . ( One must always remember in this connection , however , that the cost of living is considerably lower in Kansas than in New York . ) And of course the counties , which under the State constitution are charged with the responsibility of caring for the poor , simply could not have got through without the steady stream @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the shift to W.P.A. has been made , some of them are already having difficulty caring for their so-called unemployables . But even so , the cash-basis law has been no mean governmental achievement . During these years of depression , drought , and dust the local units have actually reduced their bonded indebtedness by $17,000,000 . Only two States west of the Mississippi River ( California and Iowa ) have contributed a higher percentage of their relief funds . If the standard of living for those on relief has been low , so has it been everywhere . Whether time shall prove the underlying philosophy of the cash-basis plan to be wise or merely penny-wise , Kansas has come through a five-year nightmare in good financial shape . Another thing Landon is not . He is not , as some wiseacres are insinuating , a naive provincial who thinks that what worked in his own little community is a panacea for the troubles of the cosmos . Of course I can not vouch for what his backers and publicity agents may say in the months between now and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of claiming whatever they think a gullible public would like to hear . But I do know that they know better . In a two-day visit in and around the green-domed State House in Topeka I did not hear the faintest hint that all the United States needs to do to get out of its troubles is to go on a cash basis . There was , of course , much talk about the " reckless waste and extravagance " of the Roosevelt Administration . Any Republican stronghold would be talking that just now . But everywhere there seemed to be the sensible view that while the cash-basis plan had worked in Kansas because we had no large accumulated debt and because we received nearly seventy per cent of our relief funds from the federal government , the national financial problem is something quite different . II Well then , if Landon is not another Coolidge , not a balancer of his State budget , and not a provincial with a cure-all , what is he ? To answer that question one must first free himself from one of the choicest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas . It is a fine mixture of natural violence and human eccentricity . In it droughts , grasshoppers , and cyclones mingle with hatchet-swinging prohibitionists , angry grangers , and picturesque politicians . According to it anything may happen in Kansas , and almost everything has . By its terms anyone from Kansas is presumed to be either a zealot suckled on Principle and weaned on Reform or an eccentric with a fiery tongue and sockless shins . It is such a delightful legend that one hesitates to question it . But the fact is that it has played out . For thirty years reality has been shying farther and farther away from it . Look at the Kansas contributions to the Senate since 1918 : Charles Curtis , Arthur Capper , Henry Allen , and George McGill . Not enough reforming zeal in the lot of them to purify one sinful village ? and not enough eccentricity to make one good page of copy for an unimaginative reporter ! The truth of the matter is that Kansas has gone conservative ? not reactionary , but somewhatright-of-center conservative . During @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slough , Iowa has had a Milo Reno and his Farmers Holiday , North Dakota a Non-Partisan League and a Lynn Frazier , Minnesota a Floyd Olson and a Farmer-Labor movement ; Nebraska has steadily returned a George Norris to plague the hereditary enemy in Wall Street ; while Oklahoma has sported an Alfalfa Bill and Texas a pair of Fergusons . To those same years , when Kansas farmers were just as badly off as any others , they have reacted by continually returning to the Senate a wealthy , mildly progressive publisher , and by going on a cash basis . When a Kansan speaks of himself as a Progressive the chances are that he means that he voted for Theodore Roosevelt in 1912 . A second fact about the Kansas scene which must be grasped in order to understand Landon is that until very recently party lines have meant little so far as State issues are concerned . Recently , as party loyalty begins to force Democrats to line up with the New Deal on specific issues which affect the State government , there begins to be a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Republicans have fought each other roundly and hated each other soundly with no more difference on basic political principles than the Red and Blue divisions of a club contest might have . Whenever a live issue has been faced , it has cut across party lines . What has counted in Kansas , as in the nation , has been the struggle for power between organized groups . The organized farmers , the various business groups , the American Legion , the W.C.T.U. and the churches , the Parent Teachers Association with the Teachers ' Association , the tax-paying leagues ? these are the political forces that have counted in recent Kansas history . They pull and haul at the governor and the legislature just as organized minorities pull and haul at Congress and the President . Because under the State constitution each county , no matter how sparse its population , has a representative , the struggle has been fairly well balanced . Thus farmers have always had numerical supremacy , but superior strategy has often enabled business groups of one sort or another to maintain a dominating position . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wheeler of the Anti-Saloon League is credited with working out the technic , but in a sense it is inherent in democracy itself . As soon as segments of the electorate discovered that their government would respond to organized pressure it was inevitable that they should proceed to organize and that avalanches of telegrams would begin to descend upon public officials . It was also inevitable that officials would come to think less of what seemed best to them as individuals or party members and more of what their constituents desired . Undoubtedly it enormously complicates the problem of the official ; for added to the old conflicts which might be set up between his private judgment and his party loyalty , is this new conflict between his judgment and the will of the folks back home . " A politics of pressures has been superimposed upon the politics of parties . Whatever else All Landon is or is not , he has shown himself dever at juggling these organized groups . Not that he is any slouch at partisan politics as they are played in Kansas . Far from it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He should at least , for he served a thorough apprenticeship . When he was only four years out of the law school at Kansas University he organized his county for Theodore Roosevelt . He has been a county chairman , a district chairman . a State chairman . He was secretary to Henry Allen when Allen was Governor . He managed the campaigns of Governor Clyde Reed , successfully in 1928 , unsuccessfully in 1932 . In1932 , when the party seemed hopelessly split between the Old Guard and the Reed forces , he got into his car and drove out into the counties to call on chairmen and farmers and shopkeepers . He is naturally a friendly , unpretentious person , and on these campaigning excursions he did not hesitate to dot the i 's and cross the is by wearing a battered hat and leaving his coat in the car . He made a good impression on a people frightened to death by thirty-cent wheat , impending mortgage foreclosures , and the radio campaign of Dr. John Brinkley . By the end of his first term the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever been , partly because the Old Guard was dying off , but mostly because Landon had managed to make himself solid with all factions . He had built up a huge acquaintance over the State . He had been careful in making his appointments . They had been deliberately made , often too deliberately to please hungry Republicans unusually ravenous after being turned away from the national table . Few of the appointments were flagrantly bad , but all of them were aimed to build up party harmony and cement Landon 's own place in the party . All this constitutes a realistic brand of partisan politics on the Kansas scene . Much of it , of course , could not be transferred to the national scene unless he could quickly build there what he had been building over a period of twenty year in Kansas ? a circle of shrewd , trusted friends familiar with every thread of the partisan fabric . But the politics of pressures is , apparently , about the same wherever one finds it . Here Landon has used a technic that in some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one organized group against another , balanced one pressure with another , fended off dangerous showdowns , dodged back and forth between demands . To play this particular game one must be adroit . And one must not have too definite convictions about the existence of a strait and narrow way to governmental salvation . One must , in short , agree with a professor of political science whom I once heard argue that the business of the master politician is to make adjustments among the conflicting interests which tug at him . Those who fear that anyone who comes out of Kansas must necessarily bristle with Principle might be interested to know that almost the only criticism one hears of the Governor in Kansas is that he " lacks principles " ? that he responds to the heaviest pressure brought to bear upon him . One could illustrate with any of several issues which have engrossed the State in the past three years . The cash-basis law itself came in response to pressure . Landon went into office facing a tax revolt . Farmers and home owners unable to pay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ aroused . The tax-limitation amendment they proposed had been narrowly beaten down by the Parent Teachers ' Association , women 's clubs , and local officials ' organizations . The cash-basis legislation was a compromise . It lacked the rigidity of the amendment , but it did cut down taxes . Perhaps an even better illustration is the wet-dry controversy which flamed anew with the coming of national Repeal . Amusing as the fact may seem to the rest of the country , prohibition was the hottest political issue in the drought- and depression-racked Kansas of 1934 . It still had on its statutes the old bone-dry law , but beer was being sold openly in every town in the State . Such a situation was unthinkable to the drys and unsatisfactory to the wets . The usual fanfare of political maneuvering between well-organized groups ensued . Every candidate for a law enforcement or law making office in the whole State was put on the spot by both sides . Was he wet or dry ? Now Landon is , by all accounts , not austere in his personal attitude toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glad to legalize the beer shops and collect taxes from them . He must also have had his doubts about the possibility of enforcing stringent dry laws . But as a politician who meant to get himself reelected , he had sufficient sensitivity to popular feeling to realize that he must be on the dry side . And so he espoused the dry cause . I do not know what may be deduced from the election figures , but here they are . The amendment which would have repealed the bone-dry law failed by about 89,000 votes . Landon , in a year of universal Democratic landslides and just after a bond scandal which had stripped the statehouse of some of its long-time Republican tenants , was reelected by a majority of 62,000 . His political instinct had been right . Up came the legislature for the 1935 session . Every one of them had also been on the spot . Most of the House members had had the perspicacity to realize that a politician in their districts that year had better be dry . The " folks back home " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any beverage containing more than five-tenths per cent alcohol promptly passed the House . The Senators had been on the spot too . But since a larger percentage of them came from districts with an urban population , they had emerged with another view about beer . Accordingly they passed the bill but tacked to it an amendment which would make impossible any serious attempt at enforcement . Cries of rage and indignation went up from the embattled drys . The bill went through conference after conference , but neither house would budge . And so Kansas has gone merrily on with a bone-dry law on its books and beer parlors on its streets . Whether or not the Governor had any part in engineering the deadlock I have no way of knowing . But certainly he exerted no pressure whatever to break it . And certainly the old nickname of " Foxy ality knows that to be no insuperable difficulty . His mental processes are similarly unspectacular . He has a good mind , but no one ever accused him of being intellectual . His friends say that he gets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contact with , particularly those from outside his own intimate circle . He respects facts and has instituted in the State House a Research Department which is headed by a professor of political science on leave from Kansas University . All of his speeches and more and more of the daily run of State executive problems are submitted to this department to be checked . In his talk about issues he reflects fairly accurately the general state of thinking and feeling at the moment . Perhaps it is not too much to say that he represents the mass mind of the middle class . Before the depression , politics probably seemed to him only a pleasant game , played for amusement , prestige , or business interest . He grew up in the Progressive movement , which never really came to grips with the economic problem , but contented itself with child labor legislation , workmen 's compensation , equal suffrage , and the like . He no doubt felt , as did all the Progressives around him , that such reforms and , above all , " good government " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was probably his first lesson ( as indeed it was for most Americans ) in the seriousness and the complexity of that problem . And so I fancy he was perfectly sincere when he said in his first inaugural address , " Again we are in hard and trying times , and the solution of problems was never more intriguing , for our difficulties are new to the race . For centuries humanity has been compelled to deal with famine . Now in a few minutes ' time , relative to the history of man , our modern civilization is brought face to face with a complete reversal of that policy . . . . We are gazing at uncharted seas , as Balboa first gazed on the mighty Pacific . " Most people felt like that at the beginning of 1933 . The second inaugural address showed that he had made some progress in charting the sea , for he declared that the basic premise necessary for our welfare and happiness " must be the realization that this economic situation did not come upon us suddenly nor will we get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same speech are , " Our problems have been intensified by the great industrial plutocracy we have built since our last great depression of 1893 , " and ' ' Assistance to the unemployed is not a privilege or a vested right . Neither is it a charity . It is a common obligation created by the rapidity and complexity of our economic growth . " Most people had proceeded to approximately that point in their charting of the sea . His most recent address , delivered at the Kansas Day banquet on January 29th , was frankly a campaign speech . It came at a time when the mass middle-class mind was beginning to be seriously disturbed over the financial position of the federal government , but was firm in its demands that no one shall starve , that old-age pensions and unemployment insurance shall be provided , and that something real shall be done about the farm problem . Landon himself feels earnestly on all these points . And so he spoke strongly about the " appalling waste and extravagance " of the present Administration . As ways @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ non-partisan basis and destroying the spoils system by greatly extending civil service . He remarked that the problem of unemployment is " national in scope and should be solved on a national basis " and added cautiously , " This involves the most careful consideration of the limitations of the Federal and State constitutions . " He favored old-age pensions and unemployment insurance , but described the recent legislation as " utterly unworkable , hastily thrown together , and makeshift . " He stated that " there is no single solution of the farm problem , " and took a leaf from everybody 's book by advocating soil conservation , flood control , tariff compensations , and expanding the home and foreign markets . It was a good middle-of-the-road speech . It said , in general , what most of the people who pride themselves on their common sense are saying just now . It indicates as well as anything could the man Landon and the politician Landon . In short , it was a bid for the Republican nomination from the middle of the road . It said to both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get the sort of candidate you 'd really like . If you could get him , you could not hope to elect him . " It was the siren call of the Center . It may not have been profound thinking , but it was good politics . It does not answer , of course , the question , " Is this man from Kansas big enough for the presidency ? " Perhaps the best answer to that was made by one of his most intimate friends , William Allen White : " The impact of the job in the White House is tremendous . If a man has any latent subconscious powers they are aroused by the overwhelming responsibility . Few men fail to respond to this awful challenge . Taft rallied slowly , Harding failed . . . . I am inclined to believe that Landon would rise to it . I do n't know . No man knows . I do n't think he knows . I think that is the reason he is modest . He stands in awe and fear of the terrible consequences of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
