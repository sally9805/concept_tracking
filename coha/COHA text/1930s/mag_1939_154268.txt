It became known last week that a committee of Eastern railroad presidents , headed by big , bald Frederick Ely Williamson of the New York Central , was studying the possibility of cutting passenger fares . Thus an amusing cycle in the Eastern railroads ' fare policy seemed soon due for completion . <P> Five and a half years ago Mr. Williamson headed another committee with exactly the same mission . Certain Western and Southern roads had tried cutting fares , had got an immediate rise in passenger revenue . Nonetheless , after due discussion , the Eastern roads decided against slashing the established 3.6-a-mile coach fare , 4 Pullman fare . Finally , in 1936 , ICC ordered them to cut to 2 and 3 respectively . The Eastern roads were furious at the order , would have fought it out in court had not the Baltimore &; Ohio refused to cooperate . Passenger revenue , however , jumped as a result of the lower rates ( Mr. Williamson 's New York Central enjoyed a $7,000,000 rise that year ) . <P> Last spring , faced with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ persuaded even the B. &; O. that higher passenger fares were the thing . In July , ICC agreed to a rise in the coach fare from 2-to-2 . This time , instead of the $32,000,000 boost in revenue which Mr. Williamson and friends expected , passenger revenues dropped-the New York Central 's falling 17% in August , compared with 1937 , the B. &; O. 's 19.5% , the New Haven 's 3% . This slump continued until the Christmas holidays , when the roads experimentally restored the old low rates , got an immediate lift . Hence last week 's committee . <P> Three years ago , onetime New York State Senator John Ambrose Hastings , once one of Jimmy Walker 's henchmen and now installed in Washington with the backing of Frank R. Fageol , president of Twin Coach Co. ( a bus manufacturer ) , suggested to Federal Coordinator of Transportation Joseph Eastman that railroad fares be " postalized . " Fortnight ago Mr. Hastings popped up again with his scheme , took a full-page advertisement in the New York Times to propound it . Under " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine zones , and for each of five types of passenger service the same rate would be charged for travel anywhere within a given zone . Examples : New York to Albany , $1 ; New York to Chicago , $1 . There would also be suburban zones-15 for a single trip , 25 for a round trip . <P> Would this ultimate in rate-slashing produce a compensating increase in traffic ? Although passengers provide only 10% of total U. S. train revenue , most Eastern roads get an abnormal share of their revenue from passengers ( the New Haven gets 36% ) . For them , the success of postalized fares would probably depend on whether the bargain rates for commuters inspired an exodus to the " suburban zones . " <P> Skipping all such considerations , Senator Burton Wheeler , head of the Senate Interstate Commerce Committee , last week declared that postalization looked good to him , passed it along to ICC .
