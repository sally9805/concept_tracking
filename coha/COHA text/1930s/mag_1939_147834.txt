Hex <P> Sirs : The fatality of TIME 'S cover is not exclusively reserved for sports figures ( Letters , Nov. 27 ) . The following men have been jinxed immediately , or soon after , their appearance as Men of the Week ( I include only those I remember offhand - there are undoubtedly many more ) : Ethiopia 's Selassie Jan. 6 , 1936 - his country accompanied him into oblivion . <P> Austria 's last ( and perhaps , late ) chancelor March 21 , 1938 - he was well down the kids when TIME brought him out . <P> Czechoslovakia 's Benes June 27 , 1938 - Same as above . <P> Poland 's Beck March 6 , 1939 - Ditto . <P> Poland 's Smigly-Rydz Sept. 14 , 1939-He ran true to form also . <P> Albania 's Zog - If he was n't on TIME 'S cover , he surely missed a good bet . <P> Sweden 's Gustaf Oct. 30 , 1939-His budget is out of balance for the first time in years . <P> Chrysler 's Keller Oct. 16 , 1939- @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his company ran into a disastrous strike . <P> Michigan 's Vandenberg Oct. 2 , 1939 - Routed decisively in the Great Neutrality issue . <P> Britain 's Churchill ; The Allies ' Newall ; Britain 's Elizabeth ; Rumania 's Carol ; and The Netherlands ' Wilhelmina : I can but tremble for them , after their appearance on TIME 'S front . <P> Germany 's Hitler ( last year 's MAN ) : Here is a boy who is long overdue . Can not TIME bring him out again , and finish the job ? It might atone for some of the innocents you have put the hex on . ... <P> FORREST LUCKENBILL Argenta , Ill . <P> 70,000 Finest <P> Sirs : <P> With no apologia , alibi or alias , I hereby and now register vehement protest against the harsh treatment and slurring references which you made against the fair suburb of Cicero in the Nov. 20 issue of TIME ( p. 16 ) . I do this on behalf of 70,000 residents of the town , 70,000 of the finest people in the United States of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Hoodlum , " you use the language " Cicero , the Chicago suburb whose name has been notorious ever since . " . . . <P> Cicero has a greater percentage of really fine folks than any city of similar size in the country . I should like to have you personally spend an evening with any of our fine family , club or social groups , or spend a day talking and visiting with our business and professional men on Cermak Road , or the side business streets , and I 'll wager that thereafter your opinion would not be so biased . <P> If you could have mingled with the 2,500 people who attended our annual Charity Ball , given under auspices of the Cicero Welfare Center , last Saturday night , if you would observe the work of our civic bodies and social groups , you would likewise alter your editorial opinion of Cicero . . . . <P> My only console is that the American public is fickle . It soon forgets bad news the same as it forgets good news . We know that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will cause us to forget the things that were reported yesterday . But , please TIME , pretty please , give Cicero its rightful break . <P> WILLIAM H. MAAS Editor <P> The Cicero Review Cicero , Ill.
