One of the oddest diplomatic rituals in the world is the annual negotiation for fishery lease agreements between Japan and Soviet Russia . The talks begin in November . Everyone knows how they are going to come out-as they always have , with a compromise which two fishermen could reach in an hour 's talk . But for as much as six months , representatives of the two countries bow deeply , sip tea , shake heads , pound tables , grin , frown , embrace , clench fists-throughout standing thunderously firm on impossible demands . Then , the day the first silvery smolts begin to run in the bitter waters off Sakhalin Island , the diplomats find themselves in sudden agreement , and sign . <P> But last week , when the annual talks began , there was a new , serious air about them . For one thing , Russia 's new Ambassador to Tokyo Constantin Smetanin knew what he was talking about . He used to be a professor of ichthyology . Furthermore , Ambassador Smetanin was appointed to his post the day Japan agreed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had trounced the seatful pants off the Japanese Army . He was in a position to dictate . <P> Foreign Minister Admiral Kichisaburo Nomura began to think of a " permanent arrangement . " Foreign Office Spokesman Yakichiro Suma called correspondents in to tell them : " We are anxious to settle pending questions and we hope that Russia reciprocates our desire in all sincerity . " Domei News Agency , which plays Little Sir Echo to the Foreign Office , advocated concluding a non-aggression treaty with Russia " without paying the slightest attention to displeasure felt and loudly voiced by Britain and the U. S. " This week Ambassador Smetanin had an audience with the Son of Heaven , H. I. M. Hirohito . <P> And in Moscow it was officially announced that Japanese Ambassador Shigenori Togo and Foreign Commissar Viacheslav M. Molotov had found a " community of views ... on the fundamental principles upon which a Soviet-Japanese trade agreement must be based . " In recent Russian diplomacy , non-aggression pacts have followed trade agreements as faithfully as the little lamb trailed Mary . <P> Finis ? To @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ every step which brings Russia and Japan closer together hasten-China 's fall . Soon and late , Russia has been China 's best friend-more constant and generous than Britain , the U. S. or France . But no one knows better than the Chungking Government that the Russian bear has learned how to somersault . <P> From Peking ( Japanese ) and Hong Kong ( neutral ) came reports that last month Communist Generalissimo Mao Tse-tung charged the central authorities with failing to set up democratic government in China , with having arrested a Communist officer without provocation , with having actually fought a three-day battle against the Communists when the Japanese were less than 100 miles away . <P> A short-wave broadcast from Tokyo last week reported new conflict : Some fighting in Kansu Province , Communist demands for more Central Government funds , a conference of Communist leaders at Yenan headed by the second-in-command , Chu Teh , to discuss the contingency of open warfare with Chungking.
