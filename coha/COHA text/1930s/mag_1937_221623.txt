When he is not experimenting on cosmic rays , high-haired Director William Francis Gray Swann of Franklin Institute 's Bartol Research Foundation , plays a cello . Young William Edgar Danforth , his assistant , plays a cello too . Both are mainstays of the Swarthmore ( Pa . ) Symphony Orchestra , a volunteer organization of about 40 men and women who play good music free . Because nobody in the orchestra can handle a French horn or a bass clarinet , Drs . Swann and Danforth built an electrical " oscillion " so ingenious that it can be made to sound like either , so simple that a child can master it . Last week at a Swarthmore concert the oscillion made its world debut , playing the long clarinet passages in Cesar Franck 's D Minor Symphony without a mishap . Listeners thought the oscillion lacked color , was a little twangier in tone , otherwise indistinguishable from the woodwind it replaced . <P> The Danforth &; Swann oscillion is a simple-looking oblong wooden box with an electrical circuit inside . Current flows through a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a neon tube , becomes a series of electrical " pulses . " A loud speaker translates the pulses into sound . <P> To play music the oscillionist presses down on a keyboard and changes the resistance . This alters the frequency , thereby the pitch . As now constructed the oscillion has a range of five octaves which can easily be increased to eight . Inventors Danforth &; Swann deplore the oscillion 's higher ranges , expect it will be most useful pinch-hitting for bass clarinet , bassoon , tuba and string bass .
