txt Count Konrad von Preysing-Lichtenegg-Moos , the Catholic Bishop of Berlin , today issued a pastoral letter in which he charges that Germany is being sYs-1 tematically de-Christianized in a cautious fashion calculated not to arouse too intense public protest . The letter leaves no doubt of the Bishop 's conviction that the regime is set on completely destroying the Christian religion . . Bishop von Preysing has often appeared as a spokesman for the other Catholic Bishops and unquestionably his episcopal epistle is a direct result of the conference of Bishops at Fulda in August and the discussions between Pope Pius and a delegation from it . " The offensive against the Church is being carried through step by step but nonetheless systematically in order that its purpose , de-Christianization of our life , may not be recognized too soon , " Bishop von Preysing says . " In the schools , likewise , one phase has followed on another : First came the ? suppression of cloister schools on the ground that there was no need for them ; second came the suppression of de1 nominational @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ; third came the expulsion of priests from the schools with the excuse that lay teachers can provide religious instruction . Asks What Will Come Next " The question now is , what will come next ? Will religious instruction be entirely suppressed and an anti-Christian ideology forced on children ? " In this critical hour I remind Christian teachers that according to the laws of God and this State religious teaching belongs rightly within the sphere of the church . Consequently no one can- teach religion rightfully who does not possess the church 's sanctions . " Parents , listen to the plea of your Bishops ! Your ' children 's souls are at stake and you will be held responsible before God 's judgment seat . Support Catholic teachers by watching closely the religious teaching that your children receive . Read prayers with them . In the future all children must gather at least once a week about their priests for religious instruction . " Parents , you must be sure that your children attend these gatherings regularly . I confide in you and you will not disappoint @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and pray that you may remain loyal to Christ and His holy church . " The letter began with the following announcement : " To my deepest sorrow I must inform you that henceforth your priests with a few exceptions are not allowed to teach religion in the schools . Therewith the slogan ' Away with the priests in the schools ! ' has found its fulfillment . Therewith the beneficial cooperation between church and school has been destroyed . Therewith your children 's souls are to be deprived of the priest 's words . " This fact , which shocks all of as , is a symptom of the coming hour when every true Catholic will be called on to suffer for his faith . " As your Bishop I was not given the reasons why your priests are I no longer permitted to teach religion , but it is not difficult to find them . " Under the slogan ' Deconfessionalize public life ' efforts have gone on for years to check church influence on the lives of the people . They have worked tirelessly to suppress the church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that priests have been expelled from the schools ? " We know how closely the priests ' work and the priests ' word bind children 's souls to Christ . Therefore he who wishes to estrange children from Christ must deprive them of their priests . " It will be said that regular teachers instead of priests will give religious instruction . But here lies the danger . Children will no longer receive instruction in the spirit of the church . " Manifold attempts are being made to instill an un-Christian and anti-church attitude in teachers . In the speeches and writings of the men responsible for the nation 's I spiritual and intellectual life you can see what they think and teach about the Bible and how they slander Catholic life . " Teachers who conduct their teaching in such fashion are poisoning your children . " Some 12,000 delegates of the Swastika National Church movement In the Protestant church gathered at Eisenach today for their annual convention . They issued a violent attack on the Oxford world church congress for its criticisms of the National Socialist regime . Although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the National Church delegates ' deelaration has been Issued by the Government news agency to all newspapers throughout Germany . These National Socialist Protestants declare : " Because the National Church movement of German Christians is interested in the Christian faith of the German people and not in exploded world utopias , we refuse to have any relations whatsoever with the so-called ecumenical movement . " We protest passionately the fact that the ecumenical movement has employed the churches and abused the idea of religion for a political attack on National Socialism , to which we cling with all our hearts . " Any Christian conference , such as the Oxford congress , that tries to judge and lay down rules on the subject of the church , the community and the State has lost the right to call on the gospel 's authority , " Such a conference has nothing to do with religion . It served political purposes and created in rivalry with the Vatican a world church conference at Geneva or Canterbury . " It will suffer the fate of the political international to which it sold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the ruins of all political and Christian internationals . " The unexpected crowd of delegates , which filled to overflowing the little Luther city of Eisenach , is evidence that the National Church movement is becoming a serious menace to orthodox Protestantism . Court Upholds Closing Schools BERLIN , Oct. 10 ** Wuerttemberg supreme administrative court has upheld an order by the Wuerttemberg Minister of Culture whereby a number of Catholic girls ' schools were closed on the grounds that they were superfluous . The court ruled negatively on the contention of Catholic authorities that this was in violation of the concordat between the Government and the Vatican . It held that it was within the powers of the Ministry of Culture to decide which schools were considered necessary and which superfluous . At Bad Segeberg , Dr. Joseph Goebbels , the Propaganda Minister , denied in an address that the Nazi regime was opposed to religion . He added that it had " no use for theological hair-splitting ? it wants - Christianity Of deeds . "              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
