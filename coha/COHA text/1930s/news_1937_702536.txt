txt Renewing his attack on labor unions as " the worst things that ever struck this earth , " Henry Ford declared today that the Ford Motor Company would soon " demonstrate wages , production and competition such as never seen before . " The manufacturer reiterated at his Winter home here that he " will never recognize the ' United . Automobile Workers association or any other union for collective bargaining . " " Labor unions are backed by warseeking financiers and take away a man 's independence , " he asserted . " They are the worst things that ever struck this earth . " The financiers want to kill competition so as to reduce the income of workers and eventually bring on war . " We have been holding down production so as not to take advantage of strike-beset competitors . But when this strike mess is entirely over , we 'll demonstrate some real competition in quantity production such as never seen before with new methods that will call for more skill , higher wages and a larger number of employes . " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conference in Dearborn last week with Edsel Ford , his son , who is president of the company . " We discussed the strike situation first and then talked about our men , " he said . " My son is very keen on revising present methods in production , salaries and efficiency and I am in accord . " Mr. Ford recalled that at one time , prior to the depression , he paid a minimum wage of $7 per day , but would not say whether he had a definite plan at this time to raise his minimum wage , which is now $6 per day . " There should n't be any bargaining or dealing necessary between employers and employes , " Mr. Ford went on . " Our company pays the best wages it can and always has . We keep a surplus on hand so as to be independent of financiers , but our surplus has not increased . We can pay more when we increase the quantity of our production . " We 're all workers together , the men and I. " Holds Freedom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ main thing to consider , after all , is freedom . That 's the foundation of America . The men in our plants are free and they are better off for it . There are thousands of things that could be produced cheaply today for the comfort and convenience of the common man except for control manifested by finance and organizations of one sort or another . " When these organizations are removed and industry is liberated , everything will improve . We will see a real prosperity . " He asserted that financiers were supporting the proposal to reorganize Federal courts , because " we 'll have another NRA if the court is packed and there will be another attempt made to control and throttle industry . " The court has never been packed before , because a President comes and goes before he - is able to do so , " he continued . " The court now is created - Jut of life itself . It was oy men inspired by the Almigl'ity and has stood the test of time for 150 years . " Public opinion will control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ strike question That is why I have such faith in newspapers . They express public sentiment ; and best of all . they have never been wholly controlled . Newspapers are both educators and lawmakers . " Messages Endorse His Views Mr. Ford . said he had received scores of congratulatory telegrams from every section of the United States in connection with his stand against labor unions . He showed to newspaper men a group of typical messages , asking that the names of senders be withheld .

Homer Martin , president of the United Automobile Workers of America , replying to Mr. Ford 's prediction of " wages , production and competition such as never seen before , " said today : " Mr Ford is evidently like other corporations contemplating the raise of wages with an idea that he can stop the unionization of his workers by this method . This is old strategy , but it will not work in this new day for labor . The workers of this country know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than either General Motors or Chrysler . " A raise in wages at this time can not be mistaken by the workers . They will recognize it , immediately , as an effort on Mr. Ford 's part to keep them out of the union . They also recognize that whatever increase they get will be the result of the existence and activity of the United Automobile Workers of America . "
