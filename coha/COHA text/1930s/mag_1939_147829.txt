When a Frenchman , over his hot brioches and chocolate , unfolds his morning paper to stare at gaping columns of white space , he shrugs and murmurs philosophically : " Anastasie ! " A haggard , black-gowned , crotchety old maid , armed with an immense pair of shears , Anastasie is a characteristic creation of Gallic wit . She personifies the tightlipped , prudish silence clamped on the French press in wartime . <P> A veteran of World War I ( named after St. Anastasia , who had her tongue cut out for resisting the advances of Roman Emperor Valerian ) , Anastasie was revived by a French satirical weekly , Le Canard Enchaine , when World War II began . She presides over the crowded corridors of the Hotel Continental in the Rue de Castiglione , home of Jean Hippolyte Giraudoux 's Ministry of Information . <P> From the Continental come terse , dry bulletins issued by the Army General Staff , and cunning propaganda stories ( of plots to restore the Kaiser , failure of German food supplies ) concocted by Playwright Giraudoux himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ housed U. S. tourists , censors sit poring over proofs of tomorrow 's papers , ferreting out lines that might give information to the enemy . <P> British papers , still sold in France , are avidly read for news suppressed by French censors . The London Times and Daily Telegraph run to 16 pages , censored before they are set up in type , without those mysterious omissions that irritate readers of the French press . A typical French daily has only four pages and contains virtually no news except Army communiques . To fill out the sparse fare supplied by the Ministry of Information , editors translate dispatches from British papers . <P> So bitterly outspoken against censorship were Britain 's publishers in the first weeks of the war that Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was forced to separate censorship from the Ministry of Information , reorganize both . But the French press , except for sly references to Anastasie , is not even allowed to point out the censor 's errors . Parisians are still chuckling over a critical essay : titled " Censure et Propa-gande " that appeared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blank , and bore the legend : " Censure . " <P> When Leon Blum , onetime Premier of France , was attacked as an " unconscious " German agent by the reactionary Paris Matin , he wrote an answer for his own Socialist daily , Le Populaire , that began : " We do n't see how censorship could prohibit us from making a legitimate reply . " The rest was censored . Next week Editor Blum tried a trick that worked for Georges Clemenceau in War I : he sent copies of a censored article by mail to members of the Chamber of Deputies . They were seized by postal censors . <P> French editors are especially chagrined because they can not publish photographs taken under the eyes of French military authorities at the front . The same pictures appear in British journals which are read in France ; but they can not be transmitted to any neutral country . Telegrams and cables , no matter where they originate , are censored .
