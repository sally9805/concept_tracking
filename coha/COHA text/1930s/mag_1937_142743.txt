At the wheel of vast Brazil for seven years has sat dressy little President Getulio Vargas , who elected himself the first time in 1930 by throwing President-elect Julio Prestes in jail and was legally " reelected " for his present term which expires next year . Last week even the remotest of Brazil 's jungle towns heard the news they had long been awaiting : that Strong Man Vargas is content to abide by Brazil 's Constitution which forbids him to succeed himself in January 's presidential election . Chosen in Rio de Janeiro by an all-party conclave as the " official " ( i. e. , majority ) candidate for the presidency last fortnight , President Vargas ' onetime Minister of Communications Jos Americo de Almeida was scheduled to sit in front while his master Vargas climbs peaceably in back . <P> A harmless bureaucrat chiefly remembered for reducing electric rates in the Rio de Janeiro Federal District , President-designate Americo will be amenable to back-seat suggestion . His sole January opposition , outside of noisy but insignificant Fascist and Communist candidates , will consist of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sao Paulo , which is still bitterly unreconstructed by the Vargas Revolution . <P> Brazil 's Vargas had more to comfort him last week than the prospect of a rest . Big , swashbuckling Governor Flores da Cunha of his home state of Rio Grande do Sul , who rebelliously threw his support to Candidate Salles de Oliveira to keep his onetime friend Vargas from succeeding himself , was left stranded absurdly without an issue . Hemmed in by a solid wall of Federal troops suspiciously watching for any trouble he might start with his 30,000 militiamen , Governor Flores da Cunha received without enthusiasm the news that Candidate Salles de Oliveira was about to charter a steamship for a barnstorming campaign along the coast .
