The 623,000 people who live in the District of Columbia have a local government which costs 48-odd million dollars a year . Because its large realty holdings are taxexempt , the Federal Government last year contributed a flat $5,000,000 to help run the District . For the privilege of doing business in Washington , some 45,000 businessmen paid in licenses and business-privilege taxes another two million into the District 's till . The additional 41 millions or so were paid by D. C. citizens who always grouse about taxation without representation , because Congress makes their laws but they can not vote for Congressmen . <P> This year the House , through an advisory committee which included ten D. C. citizens and officials , overhauled the District 's tax structure with the object of making the District selfsupporting . Last week when the new D. C. tax bill appeared before the House , it was found to contain : <P> 1 ) A maximum limit of $1.75 per $100 on the realty tax ( still very low by comparison with other cities ) . <P> 2 ) Abolition @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) An income tax , personal and corporate , brand-new for the voteless District of Columbia . The personal tax ran from 2% on $1,000 of taxable income to 7% on upwards of $9,000 . <P> D. C. citizens who sat in on the bill 's preliminary drafting thought an income tax would be fair enough , partly because 36 of the 48 States now have such taxes either personal , corporate or both , partly because it appeared , in the light of this year 's Supreme Court decisions , that Federal employes would share such a tax-and U. S. workers constitute about one-fifth of the District 's population . <P> Almost incredible to these voteless tax payers was the very first amendment made in the bill last week by the House . Offered by Missouri 's Cochran , boldly supported by Majority Leader Sam Rayburn , overwhelmingly-and anonymously-voted by all present , the amendment specifically exempted all members and employes of Congress from " be District income tax . <P> Oklahoma 's Nichols offered an extraordinary excuse for Congressional exemption . <P> <P> " I am not here of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come by reason of the fact that I am a servant of the constituency of approximately 300,000 people , the same as all of you men . ... I would have to be here if we were living in tents ! " <P> When the District 's voteless citizen-advisers beheld the House 's handiwork , they sped to the Senate hot with anger . Virginia 's Carter Glass promptly announced himself as a champion for scores of thousands of Federal workers not so fortunate as to work for Congress . What the House had done for itself , the Senate could undo . Pending redress , Columnist Raymond Clapper ( Scripps-Howard ) spoke for other nonimmune D. C. residents in words of measured scorn .
