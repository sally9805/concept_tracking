txt There is somber reading in the National Industrial Conference Board 's index figures for last month 's production in the basic industries , as compared with the July average for the years 1925-29 . Automobile output down to 55 per cent , iron and steel to 45 per cent , copper and zinc shipments to 55 per cent , Dunning construction to 50 per cent -- these make up a cheerless list at the bottom of which we find machine-tool orders down to 32 per cent , machine-tool shipments to 40 per cent and machine-tool orders unfilled to 50 per cent . Yet these last figures have their brighter side . They suggest an answer to a great fear that is now being popularized . We are asked to think of a Machine Age doomed to destruction by its own increasing speed . Man having embarked on the invention of inventions , he is fated to go on perfecting machines and piling up surpluses and swelling the armies of unemployed . The day foreseen by the saturnine SAMUEL BUTLER , is here , when man will be devoured by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ menace of overproduction , growing with the growth of the machine , to be averted ? Well , one way of postponing the evil day , if not of definitely removing it , is by inventing and using machines more slowly . After all , it is not absolutely demonstrated that it is man 's doom to go on achieving technological triumphs at top speed , come what may . He will not , of course , destroy the machines he has invented . He will not stop inventing new ones . But the rate at which he will perfect machines is bound to be regulated by the very profit motive which is called the mainspring of our present economic system . If the progress of machinery continues to destroy profits with increasing frequency , then the progress of machinery will slacken . One hundred and thirty years ago the world was invited to consider the menace of another kind of overproduction  --  the overproduction of human beings . But the great Malthusian fear has been dissipated , for most of the Western nations at least , by birth restriction . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ machines is stronger in man than the impulse to multiply his own kind . If he has learned to hold that powerful urge in check under economic pressure , he may yet learn how to regulate his machine output . The remarkable progress in technology during the last fifteen years , resulting in overproduction , is to be largely explained on the same grounds as the remarkable advance in agricultural productivity , also resulting in glut . It was not Doom , it was profits . The World War imparted an enormous stimulus which only in the- last few years has spent itself . There is in the world today too much wheat , coffee , sugar , rubber and tin because in the year 1919 wheat brought $2.35 a bushel , coffee 22 cents a pound , sugar 10 cents , tin 70 cents , rubber 65 cents . There are in the world today too many machines  --  for the time being -- because the war created a tremendous demand fur labor-saving devices . inventors . today are likely to move somewhat less feverishly . Once upon a time the great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by buying up inventions and suppressing them . Today they are accused of having brought the world to its present pass by accelerating invention . Both charges may be true . But that would only show that capital does pay attention to the profit motive in its attitude to the Machine .
