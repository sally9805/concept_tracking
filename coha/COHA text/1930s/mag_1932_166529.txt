When a Hungarian military plane crashed at aerial maneuvers near Rome , Premier Mussolini took quick , expensive action to prevent a crack in the Italo-Hungarian entente . He despatched as a gift to the Hungarian Government a brand new Italian plane painted boldly with the words " Justice for Hungary ! " Next he commanded that a memorial shaft be raised to the two Hungarian airmen who lost their lives in the crash , George Enders and Julius Bittay . Finally Italy 's Dictator sent to each of the dead men 's families in Hungary a present of 50,000 lire ( $2,000 ) .
