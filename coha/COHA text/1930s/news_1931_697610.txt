txt Proponents of the so-called Rhode Island plan proposing to link New England railroads with trunk lines west of the Hudson River will face an up-hill fight before the Interstate Commerce Commission if the proposition conies before that body . To date the policy of the commission , as indicated in its official consolidation plan , decisions and reports is opposed to a fusion of the lines of the Eastern region with those in New England . Multiple alignment of New England lines within their own territory appears to be favored by a preponderance of known commission views . Such an allocation is considered in informed local railroad quarters as having the best chance of commission sanction even in the face of a recently negotiated agreement for eventual fourparty alignment of roads west of the Hudson River . This , of course , does not preclude the commission from having an open mind on any proposal which may come before it , as indeed it has , but the burden of proof will be on proponents of the Rhode Island plan . Reduced Competition Main Objection Principal objection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Trunk LineNew England amalgamation is feeling that open competition through free trunk line routing would not be maintained . As Commissioner Joseph B. Eastman pointed out in his comments upon the official consolidation of the Federal commission drafted in 1929 : " Present routes and channels of trade can be maintained more effectively and the advantages of competition between the trunk lines can be better realized if these New England lines are not absorbed by them " ? meaning by trunk lines operating west of the Hudson River . Aside from New York Central control of Boston &; Albany , Commissioner Eastman said he was " strongly of the view " that the other New England lines should not be permitted to pass under control of the eastern trunk lines . Competitive factor in the consolidation of railroads was one of the main points emphasized in the commission 's main report on its consolidation plan . " Under the act , Section 5 ( 4 ) , any plan of consolidation which may be adopted shall preserve competition as fully as possible , " it said . Although it remains to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose as an answer to the railroad problem of their section , reflection of preponderant shippers ' views aired in testimony before committee would presage a multiple-system allocation in the Northeast . This sentiment can not be ignored . Solution Would Have Support Such a solution would have strong support , it is felt , especially in view of the fact that the Interstate Commerce Commission advocated multiple New England systems in its official plan of December , 1929 . In addition , a multiple alignment of the Northeastern roads within their own territory would have the support of the so-called anticonsolidationists of the Interstate Commerce Commission . Coming within this category are Commissioners Eastman and . Both are opposed to railroad consolidations on a large scale as would be involved in an EasternNortheastern rail fusion . Judged by previous expressions , both those members can be relied upon to oppose either an All-New England or as Eastern-Northeastern amalgamation . Furthermore , the commission recently has indicated a desire to undertake about eight more Clayton anti-trust act investigations and it is likely that action of Pennsylvania Railroad in acquiring dominant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroads may come within the scope of these inquiries . It is conceded there is no competition as between the P. R. R. and New Haven , but it is a different story as between the latter road and the Boston &; Maine . Critics of the Rhode Island plan here say that transportation conditions in the New England and the Eastern regions are so radically different as to militate against a homogeneous splicing of the roads of the respective sections . They feel a " hybridized " railroad structure would result . Freedom of Route Sought The chief objective of New England shippers . it was pointed out , is freedom to route their traffic via any of the numerous gateways to the north and west of the New England region . Trunk line dominance of their rails , it is felt . would preclude this privilege . Proposals in the Rhode Island plan are not new to the Interstate Commerce Commission . A similar set-up was tendered by Professor W. Z. Ripley in his 1921 draft of a plan for the commission which also suggested an All-New England alignment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the commission 's tentative consolidation plan of 1921 , by assigning principal New England roads to eastern trunk lines , abandonment of the idea is apparent under the 1929 plan where it receives no mention except the Eastman expression in opposition to such an amalgamation . The 1921 plan would have set up the Rutland , Boston &; Maine , Maine Central and Bangor &; Aroostook with New York Central while Baltimore &; Ohio would have received the New Haven , Central of New England and the bridge lines , the Lehigh &; New England and Lehigh &; Hudson . Quadruple Alignment in 1929 Plan The 1929 official plan contemplates virtually a quadruple alignment which is arrived at by basing two principal systems upon the New Haven and the Boston &; Maine , and according the Boston &; Albany arm to the New York Central system while treating the Canadian owned group of roads as an added system . Had the commission been impressed with the idea embodied in the Rhode Island plan , which resurrects the Ripley proposal to this extent , it would have been reflected in the 1929 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ views of Commissioner Eastman in this regard are significant since he more nearly represents the New England view on the commission than any other member . Qualified observers here confidently state that chances of the New England Governors ' Conference recommending a multiple-system railroad line-up for their states are very good .
