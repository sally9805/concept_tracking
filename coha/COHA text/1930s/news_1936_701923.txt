txt Prolonging the Sales Tax I note that our Board of Aldermen has graciously acquiesced in an extension of the " emergency " city sales tax for another year . I also note that Controller Taylor said recently that the emergency was over , that the city 's credit was in such an excellent position , its real estate tax collections so far above previous years , that our deserving city employes should now have their pay cuts restored . But what of the consumer , the worker who has suffered cuts of 20 per cent and 30 per cent , assuming that he is not totally unemployed ? Although the sales tax is the easiest and most economical to administer , nevertheless it is not measured by a capacity to pay and remains one of the most unjust taxes on record . ACERBISSIME .
