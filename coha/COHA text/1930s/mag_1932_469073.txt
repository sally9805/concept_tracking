WE HAD had no early rains and the weather was cold and frosty . The hills were still brown except in sheltered spots where a few shoots showed new green under the dead grass of last year Our ewes were old , but we had not had money enough to replace them . We had thought that with luck they might bring us another lamb crop in the spring . And our luck had been no rain and , therefore , no feed . The ewes tottered about on the range searching for grass and eagerly eating any belated dry leaves and acorns that still fell from the naked trees . I could not bear to watch them making their morning trip , single file , around the hill to the salt trough . At that hour the sun , slanting across their backs , emphasized the sunken hollows in front of their lean flanks and made them look even poorer than they were . Jim rode range every day , looking for the ewes that had fallen down and were too weak to get up . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sheds and feed them the precious hay that we had bought at thirty dollars a ton ? on borrowed money . Every morning and every night it was necessary to lift them one by one and hold them on their legs while they obediently answered the calls of nature . He would try to make them walk a few steps , too , but mostly they made no effort and would flop flat as soon as he Iet go , happy to be allowed to lie still and eat the feed under their noses . This hopeless sight finally infuriated me . " They 're not worth it , " I raged , staring at their meek silly faces and their chewing jaws . " I do n't believe they 'll ever have lambs . " " Maybe not , " Jim said wearily , " but I ca n't just let the old girls die , can I ? " He stood upright for a moment to rub his aching back . When you go out on the range and find them down you could shoot them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I argued . But Jim only shook his head . " I 'll save a certain percentage . " By lambing time we had about a hundred and fifty of these hospital cases , and then the worst possible thing happened ? a cold , heavy storm . Icy winds tore over the hills and shrieked around the sheds . Rain , too late , too cold , fell in merciless sheets , beating the dry earth to mud , tearing in torrents down the gullies , changing ditches into raging creeks , turning creeks into mad rivers . Weather like that at lambing time ? and everybody knows that the ewes always pick the worst night of a storm to have their lambs . When the rain began Jim stood at the kitchen window and watched the pepperwoods on the hill lashing about in the frenzy of the gale . He said , " Not one lamb could live through this . We 'll have to bring in the sheep and Iamb in the sheds . " " But we have n't enough feed . " Jim sighed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the First National right now and see if I can borrow another thousand for hay and grain . I thought maybe they could pull through without it , but they ca n't in this weather . " He put on an extra sweater and his slicker and went out to the garage to fit all four chains on the little roadster . I watched him from the window as he started out and saw the wind tear the battered old top off the car just as he reached the corner of the field . It was sixteen miles to town over narrow mountain roads with ten gates to open and shut . He got hack late that night , stiff with wet and cold . But he had the thousand and the feed had been ordered . " Let 's hope we get enough out of the lambs to pay this hack , " he said and sat down before the fire to unlace his sodden boots , We spread his dripping clothes about the stove on chairs to dry so that he might wear them in the morning . Storm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to-morrow . II The drive proved to be a very slow one . The sheep stood together in the timber and refused to leave this scant shelter to come out into the storm . We could not let the dogs force them because the ewes were so weak and so heavy with lamb . Some of the lambs had already begun to come and these had to be left behind with their mothers to be brought in separately . They gave us a lot of trouble . The ewes knew that they had little or no milk for their lambs and preferred to leave them then and there and be done with it . Many of them would try to come away with the flock , never looking back to where the lamb , sensing desertion , lifted a feeble head and bleated weakly . Jim spurred his horse and splashed madly through the mud in a vain endeavor to turn them back , cursing themand railing at the bewildered dogs until he was hoarse . But in his heart he did not much blame those ineffectual old things for deserting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or help it much to get on its feet . And a lamb born of a weak ewe is weak too and , lying drenched in that driving cold , he will soon be dead no matter what she does . We finally got a large bunch of them into the corrals and began at once the task of sorting and segregating in the chilling rain and slush . I think I have never seen sheep so soaked and wretched , nor dogs so futile , nor Jim so dispirited . The ewes kept falling down in the mire and would lie there helpless , kicking feebly like overturned beetles . It was too much for the dog , Jerry . She finally ran baffled into a corner and sat there panting , disgusted . Shouts and curses could not move her , and it took much coaxing and petting and loving to get her back to work again . We had to separate immediately the ewes about to lamb so that Jim might give them special attention . Also many of them , weak from exposure and starvation , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them dead . I knew that Jim would be up all night operating on these poor things and that I should have to stand by , faint with disgust , but prompt to supply forceps and douches of warm lysol . Over the din of the milling sheep in the corrals came a sudden loud panic of bleating , a sharp hysterical yelping of the dogs , and Jim 's voice swearing in violent anger . I saw him kneel in a corner of the corral , frantically pulling at a pile of ewes heaped there and sobbing as he swore . " They 're dead , Ann , " he gasped . " They 're dead . Ann ! Ann ! Ann ! " " But why are they dead , Jim ? Why ? . . . Why ? " " It 's my fault . I let the dogs crowd them too much . And they got piled in this corner . Smothered . Thirty or forty of them . Ann ! Ann ! " Helplessly I put my hand on the shoulder of his dripping slicker . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but already their eyes were glassy , and nothing that anyone could do would make them breathe again . We had bought them when sheep were high fifteen dollars a head ? on borrowed money for which we still paid interest . Of course at present they were not worth three dollars in the market . But to us they were still fifteen dollars a head . The wind blew steadily from the north . The rain came down in a drenching icy downpour . Jim rose to his feet in the sucking mud and slapped the water and filth from his hands . His jaw was set against the misery in his eyes . He turned to the waiting dogs and snapped his fingers . " Get around ' em , Jerry ! Slow , Tom , slow ! Damn you , dow.t " All that night , all the next day , alI the next night we worked with the ewes , while the rain beat steadily and deafeningly on the iron roof over our heads . The sheds stank of urine , manure , and wet wool @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Our backs ached , our eyes burned , and our feet were flat with pain and numb with cold . No stops for sleep or fresh clothes . No real meals . We just drank coffee that we kept boiling in a big pot on the stove in the sheds and ate hasty sandwiches of bread and ham . We had whiskey there , too , but that was not for us . That was for the lambs that we brought in half drowned from the storm-ridden hills . We had them all about the stove in the stifling heat of a special little shed we called the " orphanage . " Beside the whiskey on the shelf were cases of canned milk , also for the lambs . Feeding and reviving these exhausted abandoned babies was my especial job . First I gave each one a hot bath in awashtub of steaming muddy water by the stove . I never changed this water , merely added to it to keep it hot , and the Iamb naturally came out of his bath dirtier than he went in . Then I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheets hanging back of the stove , rolled him in feed sacks , and gave him a little whiskey and hot water . If he was still alive when I next got around to him he got a drink of warm milk from a bottle ? a ginger ale bottle , it generally was . My chief remembrance of that mad winter is the suffocating , sickening odor of the lambing sheds , the sight of those sticky green bottles , and the rows of supine indifferent lambs in their sacks about the stove . Such a task it was , to get that first feeding into a half-dead Iamb . I would pry open very slightly his stiff clenched little jaws and let a few drops of milk run on his tongue . This invariably ran out on the other side and made a small pool on the sacking beneath his head . I would try again , anxiously awaiting the little gulp of swallowing . If I saw no gulp I tried to believe that it had merely escaped my notice and that a little milk had got inside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lamb . I could not linger over one . There were too many . I had to revive each lamb before his mother completely forgot him , which she would surely do if she did not get him back in an hour or so . It was a happy moment when I could bring one of the little beasts on his feet and see him shake himself , instead of falling down , and carry him joyfully and fearfully into the pen of unattached mothers to be claimed . Then would follow a discouraging proceeding . The ewes would heartlessly butt him over , each one taking several turns at it ; and I watched that tiny strength , which had been put into him at such labor , knocked right out of him . With amazing fortitude he would struggle to his feet each time and again bleat for his mother . If she finally noticed his presence , smelled him suspiciously to identify him , and then tenderly allowed him to claim his dinner , I decided that there was no lovelier sight than this on a sheep ranch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She would n't have known him unless she could smell him , and that is why the adoption system works . We should soon have had a lot of orphans on our hands if we could not have got some of them adopted . These orphans are the extra ones of twins or the lambs whose mothers desert them or refuse to take them . It does not pay to raise them on the bottle . The milk costs more than the lamb would bring . So we try to get him adopted . I find a faithful ewe standing guard over her still-born lamb , anxiously and stupidly expecting some miracle to bring it back to life . I become that miracle . I put the dead lamb on an empty feed sack and drag it at the end of a long rope into the shed , slowly , so that the ewe may follow . I am so far away at my end of the rope that she never connects the lamb 's progress with mine and trots after it bleating nervously and smelling it doubtfully . I stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and on we go again . When she is thus tolled into the shed Jim skins the lamb and pitches the body out of the window onto that soggy steadily-growing heap of carcasses that lies there in the rain . The body is no longer of any use . It is the precious odor on the tail that must be preserved . To the ewe that odor is her lamb . We then select a likely orphan . Over him we drape the dead lamb 's hide , tying it with cord across his little chest and under his little belly . He looks ridiculous . We place him near the ewe and retreat to a distance to see if it will be a " take . " She bleats uneasily , smells him worriedly . Thescent of blood alarms her , but there is that undeniable odor of her child . Bewildered , she walks away . He trots hopefully after , perfectly willing to he adopted by any ewe that will let him nurse . She noses him again and at last grudgingly allows him to nuzzle under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stretches a bit and finally it gets so long the little brute trips on it . He then has to be caught and trimmed . The legs can go . You cut away as much of the body as you dare , but never the tail . You long to tear off the whole thing . But it must stay on a while longer ? the ewe is still uneasy . A week is none too long . By that time the old smell has become so mingled with the new fresh odors of the live tail below that the anxious old mother is completely befouled . That is , almost always . Sometimes , on the contrary , when you have turned the pair out on the range together she will desert him after all , and days later you find his lank corpse flat upon thehillside . At the end of six weeks lambing was over . A long , hard six weeks . The last straw of alfalfa had been fed . The last carcass had been decently buried . The last doddering old ewe and wobbly lamb @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that now showed a promising if not luxuriant green . Too few , those wobbly lambs . Too many , those buried carcasses . But we had done all we could and had earned our rest . A rest to Jim means fishing ; and he took his weary legs to the creek that ran through the ranch and for ten consecutive days waded miles down its rocky stream bed carrying his salmon hook . I had another way of resting . I simply stacked the dishes in the sink every morning after breakfast , propped my feet on the open door of the kitchen stove , and read every fashion article and love story in the accumulated magazines . Spring came . Jim and I reined in our horses at the crest of a hill . It was just beginning to get light . On the opposite hillside a young doe and her two fawns watched us curiously . But the sheep in the little valley below paid us no heed . The lambs were playing in the wet grass together , running in groups of six or eight as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capering and bouncing as if feeling much too good to stand still . Nearby their mothers fed contentedly and ceaselessly . A ewe never stops eating until she dies and then she often dies with her mouth full . We had come out to drive them into the corrals but we hated to disturb them . However it had to be done . Marking time had come . Marking consists of docking the ewe Iambs ' tails and castrating and docking the buck lambs , and putting an identifying cut in the ears of all . Jim motioned toward the sheep . The dogs were off instantly . The dogs love their work and bristle with importance when they surround a flock of sheep and drive them triumphantly in This is play for them in the summer and fall , but it is work in the spring when the lambs are small and many ewes fight the dogs at every step . Also the lambs run in every direction but the right one , the dogs yapping in pursuit , and even the ewes turn uncertainly and lumber after them . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we were all pretty much exhausted ? men , horses , dogs , ewes , and lambs . The panting dogs raced to the watering trough and drank their fill and drank again . The clamor was deafening . Each lamb determinedly Heated for his mother , and each ewe incessantly bawled an answer which she often idiotically continuedeven after her own lamb had been found and was on his knees under her belly , greedily hunching her udder and joyfully wiggling his tail . Old White-eye Pelayo had already arrived and was at that moment unloading his blankets at the bunk house . It was very old-fashioned of us to employ Pelayo for our marking , but our lambs always did well under his ministrations , and as he had marked for the ranch every year for forty-five years , we felt as if we had bought him and his methods along with the range and the ranch house . I murmured to Jim as he tied his horse at the corral fence , " Ca n't you put the new boy at the chute gate ? I think he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Sure , " said Jim , but laughing at me . " We wo n't need him especially . The Henderson boys are here and can catch and hold for Pelayo. " loosened the dogs and drove the sheep through the chute to the boy who worked the gate , dodging the ewes into the pasture and the lambs into the marking pen . I then sent him to the house on an errand and so got him away from the sheds . I dreaded disillusioning him unnecessarily . I should have remembered that we all had to have lunch together and that when old Pelayo marked he always had to have his plateful of lamb fries . We ate at a long oil-cloth covered table on the big screened porch . Luke and 011ie Henderson had taken off their dirty jumpers , put on their decent blue shirts , and scrubbed their honest , simple faces , but Pelayo just washed his gnarled black-nailed paws and called it a day . His shirt was black with tar and wool grease . And he did n't know what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from him and stared with all his eyes . Pelayo was going strong . He 'd taken one look at the boy and then started in on his worst stories . He was now telling the one about the time he had been caught in a forest fire and had had to kill his horse and crawl inside until the fire went over . " Shut up , Pelayo , " said Jim brusquely . The boy got up from his chair , white-faced . " Excuse me , " he mumbled , and went out the screen door and down the steps . That afternoon I walked over to the sheds where they were marking . I had hoped that Jim had put the boy to work in the corrals again , but no , he had him right at the marking table . The boy had already learned the trick of holding the lambs so that they would n't kick loose . I caught the boy 's haggard gaze and tried to smile at him , but he flushed and looked away . I edged up to Jim and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He wants to du everything we do , " he said out of the side of his mouth . " Just as well for him to get over it now , anyway . There 's worse things than this on a sheep ranch . " I thought of this remark one day a month later when the boy came galloping in from the range on his sweating horse . " Jim sent me in for some pinetrol , " he said . " What 's the matter ? Flies ? " " Yes , " said the boy , and gulped . He was green about the mouth . " A ewe ? " " No , a lamb ? one of those big , fine , black-faced ones . Oh , it was a dandy lamb . " " Is it pretty bad ? " " It ca n't walk ? we 're going to try to carry it in on a sack . " " I 'd better go with you and bring one of the dogs . You may need help getting the mother in . " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ found that Jim had already lassoed theewe and hog-tied her . She lay motionless on the ground , quiet and fearful . " She 's one of the crazy kind , " said Jim ; " she started to run off so I had to stop her ? I 'll have to pack her in too , damn her . She 's too fat to put on the saddle with safety . " He knelt beside the lamb . " We 'll have to get busy on this little fellow now ? though I think it 's too late . " I tried not to look at the little beast 's suffering , frightened eyes nor at the drawn face of the boy . When the raw flesh was dressed we carried the lamb in on a stretcher of sacks and made it a bed in the sheds . Every three hours the boy and I tried to feed it . It was too old to learn to nurse from a bottle and we had to hold the mother down beside it with her udder at its nose . Even then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the teats into its mouth . The ewe resented the entire proceeding and kicked vigorously and indiscriminately at the lamb and at us . We kept up the feedings during the night , and in the morning the lamb nursed a little by itself and was able to lift its head and bleat when it saw us coming . The boy was delighted . He talked to it softly while he helped me . He named it " Peanuts . " On the fourth morning it was dead . It had struggled to its feet in the night , got as far as the door and had fallen there . Animals mostly die in the night , I 've noticed . In an adjoining pen its mother stood , chewing her cud , her yellow eyes content . The boy did not come in to breakfast that morning , and we saw him later on the hill across the creek under a young maple tree , digging . A. little grave , probably . May came at last . The grass grew thick and lush on the range , and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lambs lay on the warm hillsides , their little snub noses turned skyward , their eyes closed in sleep , their fat woolly sides panting gently . We shattered this peace one early morning in mid May . By daylight we had had our bacon and eggs and coffee and had corralled the sheep and were crowding them through the chute ? the ewes to the left into the pasture , the lambs to the right into the loading pens . We were selling the lambs and we had to hurry to get them sorted , for only six hundred had been passed and chalked in blue by the lamb buyer , and these had to leave town on the noon freight . Already the trucks had roared up the long grade from the valley , and were standing backed against the loading platform . Up the loading chute and into the trucks the lambs scrambled , blindly fleeing the shouting , cursing , sweating men and the ceaseless cunning of the dogs . The air was thick with yellow dust , and the din was so great that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gestures only . When the end gates had been lashed fast and the motors started , the trucks circled around the corrals and eased their way down the hill toward town . The racks swayed heavily and the lambs peeped fearfully out between the bars , slid against one ' another , fell , struggled to their feet again , and braced themselves cannily for the next lurch . Jim and I pulled out last in our little ranch truck that holds only fifty lambs . The leading driver opened all the gates , and it was my job to close them after Jim had driven through . A hill woman learns to jump out and open and shut gates as naturally as the town wife pays her nickel to the conductor . At each gate the trucks halted while Jim inspected the loads to see if any lambs had fallen and were beingsmothered . Once he had to get a pile of them to their feet again . It was impossible to do this without unloading some of the lambs , and as there was no place to put them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men who passed them down to the truck drivers and to me . I squatted in the dusty road and tried to hold in either hand the hind foot of an eighty-pound lamb who was using all the strength of his other feet to get away . One of them escaped my aching arm and went leaping and running over the hill , its woolly legs working together like those of a rocking horse , its head held high , its shoe-button eyes round and shining . Two years later , identified by its earmark , it was returned to us , a meek ewe , a lamb of its own trotting after . At the freight yards the lambs had first to be weighed on the trucks and then watered before they began their long ride to San Francisco . From the pens they were driven up a sort of gangplank , or loading chute , into the cattle cars . It was hard to get them to start up this strange chute without the help of our dogs left at home , and we tried all sorts of persuasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cans , and flapping our hats . Nothing worked . There is an old ex-cowboy at the yards who is proud of his ability to mimic a ewe . When we had all failed he hobbled up the chute on his very bowed legs and hid himself in a corner of the car , bleating softly . Finally a bold lamb answered him and timidly assayed the climb up the gangplank . Then it was easy . All the lambs tried to follow at once , and we had trouble in keeping them from hurting one another in their rush . It was one o'clock before the last door grated shut and the chute was shoved away . I stood by one of the cars , looking between the slats at the lambs crowded within . They bad stopped crying for their mothers and were just standing quietly panting and nosing one another and stiffening their little legs as the cars jerked into motion . Jim came up beside me . " Well , it 's over , " he said , and wiped the sweat from his neck . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absurd to cry when the lambs go , but I always do . " How much did they weigh ? " I asked . Jim gave a short laugh . " Enough to pay our last two notes at the bank , " he said . " D' you like being a rancher 's wife ? " " I 'm a fool to like it , but I do , " I said . And we went back to our little truck and climbed in.
