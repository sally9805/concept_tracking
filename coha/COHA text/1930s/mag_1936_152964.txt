If Adolf Hitler had what psychologists call a split personality he could scarcely present himself more differently than he actually does to Germans on the one hand and to foreigners on the other . When addressing his own people on domestic issues Orator Hitler is alternately brawling and sentimental , repetitious , diffuse , coarse and ever more amazingly repetitious . His anxious care is to " talk down " to the stupidest German lout who can possibly be listening . With the " Little Man " ever in mind , Realmleader Hitler , the " Apotheosis of the Little Man , " hammers away coarsely , repeating his points over &; over again for hours at a stretch until his more cultivated radio listeners are ready to scream . <P> Emotional and intuitive Little Adolf can also " talk up " to logical , cerebral Latins and to Britons whom he humbly delights to consider superior persons . Broadcasts by Orator Hitler on foreign policy are so comparatively smooth , so well-turned and of such reasonable length as to amaze many Germans and lead to rumors that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Adolf Hitler confronted face to face by a foreigner is also different from Adolf Hitler overpowering a dazzled German . To Berlin last week , hastily summoned from Paris , hurried Paris-Midi 's correspondent de luxe , M. Bertrand de Jouvenel , son of the late , great French Senator &; Ambassador Henri de Jouvenel . In Paris the Chamber had just voted to ratify a Franco-Soviet military alliance ( see p. 18 ) . Herr Hitler did not want it to pass the French Senate and become binding as a possible check on Germany . <P> " Is n't It Logical ? " As recorded by M. de Jouvenel and syndicated in the U. S. by Universal Service the interview opened thus : <P> " I know what you are thinking , Chancellor Adolf Hitler said , advancing , with a fresh smile on his face , across his huge office in the Wilhelmstrasse . You 're saying to yourself : ' Hitler is going to make pacific declarations to me . But are they in good faith ? Is he sincere ? ' <P> " Now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out psychological puzzles , would not you be wiser to use the celebrated French logic and think it out ? Is n't it obviously wiser for our two countries to get along together ? Would n't it be ruinous for both to crash against each other on new battlefields ? Is n't it logical that I would wish what is most advantageous for my country ? And that which is most advantageous , is n't it obviously peace ? <P> " I told the Chancellor we French had his own words of hostility toward France in his book , Mein Kampj , which the Germans regard as a sort of bible , and that he had never made the slightest rectification . Hitler pondered a moment , then placed his hand on my arm . He said : You wish me to correct my book , like an author preparing a new edition . I am not an author , but a political man . I am rectifying those statements daily in my foreign policy , which extends amicability towards France . If I succeed in achieving a Franco-German rapprochement , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great book of history . "
