" The great losses and ' hard times ' which have come upon the Southern Baptists by reason of the present prolonged depression have not stopped them from wasting their substance in riotous living . The Southern Baptists waste sufficient money , along five or six lines of extravagant living every year , to finance the whole program of Southern Baptist work . " <P> So reports the Southern Baptist Handbook for 1932 , published last week . Listed as money misspent : $46,200,000 a year on tobacco ; $26,000,000 on cinema ; $21,580,000 on automobile outings ; $35,000,000 on soft drinks and chewing gum ; more than $43,000,000 on cosmetics . The Southern Baptist Church needs $40,000,000 . " Look about you . . . . quit YOUR WHINING ! " cries the Handbook .
