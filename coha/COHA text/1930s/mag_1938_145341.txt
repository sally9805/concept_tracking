In the low-brow view , most artists are screwy . In any view , two of the screwiest living artists are Painter Salvador Dali and Actor Harpo Marx . It is natural that two such surrealists should be fast friends . Early last year , while visiting in Hollywood , Dali sketched his friend Marx in pastels . Last week the odd result was hunting a buyer in San Francisco . Agent Julien Levy 's price : $500 . <P> In the centre foreground sits Harpo staring , sadly strumming on his harp . His hair is golden fuzz , interwoven with fuchsia flowers and gay green leaves . He is not surprised by the company of three attentive giraffes-their backs on fire . In the distance are eight more giraffes , also burning , trying to get away from their own heat by running .
