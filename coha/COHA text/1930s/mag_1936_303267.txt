A humble subject of His Majesty named T. H. L. Hony of Fowey in Cornwall was creating a well-bred little Mayfair stir last week with his " discovery " that King Edward VIII , his brothers and King George V were all born on Saturday . <P> The new King last week on the 58th day of his reign held his first levee as Edward VIII . Hitherto these royal receptions of men have nearly always been held in St. James 's Palace ( " The Court of St. James " ) with the Sovereign driving thither in horse-drawn state from his residence at Buckingham Palace . This procedure Edward VIII , who has his apartments in a wing of St. James 's Palace and uses Buckingham Palace merely as an office , varied in two precedent-shattering respects . He held his " Court of St. James " levee in Buckingham Palace , and he drove thither not by State Coach but for the first time in British history on such an occasion in a motor car , one of his father 's high , maroon Daimlers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in precedence down the list of States , the reason being the absence of U. S. Ambassdor Robert Worth Bingham , who was also absent at the funeral of King George and is still vacationing in the U. S. There was but one U. S. presentee outside the diplomatic circle : Mr. Caesar Augustin Grasselli. * Seated on a glittering throne , the new Sovereign received in all approximately 1,000 men-including the envoys of the Great Powers now bickering over the Rhineland Crisis ( see p. 24 ) - in the record average time of 3 seconds each . <P> The distinguished persons moved past the Throne with such rapidity that a Buckingham Palace flunky was overheard to say of His Majesty : " He fair had them going at a dog trot . " <P> <P> " He 's Good . " Dog trot is the tempo of the new reign , and last week Britons were about ready to take preliminary stock of it . Out from Court circles rippled rumors that thus far every member of His Majesty 's Government who has had private audience has afterward been heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " <P> Every Minister , according to the Court ripples , finds that King Edward , when handed a document , puts on his glasses , attentively reads it through , asks quantities of running questions , listens closely to all the answers and only then signs " Edward R.I. " The King makes the same flourish under his name he used to make when signing " Edward P. " as Prince of Wales . <P> Speeches by His Majesty in which he takes a special interest , King Edward composes on his Underwood portable , using most of his fingers in striking the keys . He then hands this typescript to his advisers , who make suggestions by striking out or inserting between his double-spaced lines . Thus the word " radio " typed by His Majesty in composing his first broadcast was struck out and in was written " wireless . " This suggestion His Majesty overruled and back the word went to " radio . "
