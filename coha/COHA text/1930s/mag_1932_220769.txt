Herbert Hoover was induced to enter the Maryland preference primary to quash , once &; for all , the nuisance value of Dr. Joseph Irwin France , his only an nounced rival for the presidential nomination . For months Maryland 's onetime Senator had been marching up &; down the country declaring that in him alone reposed the hope of party victory in November . Not taken seriously by the Hoover forces , he had entered primary after primary , won them by default and was already claiming 153 convention votes . <P> Last week President Hoover carried the Maryland primary with some 26,000 votes . <P> That gave him the State 's 16 convention votes . Dr. France was beaten on his home ground . Yet he managed to collect sufficient votes - 16,900 - to disturb the Hoover managers . What they could not explain was why so many anti-Hoover votes had been cast by Republicans who well knew they were throwing their ballots away on a vain candidate . President Hoover had won but he had not - as Cartoonist Edmund Waller Gale of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his absurd opponent as thoroughly as his Maryland friends had expected . The France nuisance value still remained and Maryland looked like a doubtful State in 1932 . <P> " Of course I wo n't support Hoover . I thought everybody knew that , " declared Nebraska 's Insurgent Republican Senator George William Norris last week . " History has demonstrated that I was right in opposing him four years ago . He has not done anything he said he was going to do . " <P> This old party rebel who campaigned for the Brown Derby four years ago was now ready to back Franklin Delano Roosevelt . <P> California Republicans in their primary last week worked hard to get out a big vote for their State 's first President , show confidence in Herbert Hoover and impress the nation . Unopposed , the President got some 650,000 votes , 83,000 more than he got in 1928.
