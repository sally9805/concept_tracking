It was ten below zero outdoors , but inside the College of the Sacred Heart in the little manufacturing town of St. Hyacinthe , Quebec one night last week a fire blazed in the furnace , students and priests were tucked snugly in their beds . On the ground floor slept Brother Lucius , head of the school , most of the 31 priests and five servants . In dormitories on the fourth floor and in the attic above it were 85 boys ( aged 9 to 20 ) and a few priests . At 1 o'clock Watchman Marcel Quesnel , 68 , sleepily made his round of the long , red-brick building , the tall tower in front , the little chapel in back . Finding everything apparently in order , he went back to doze in his chair . <P> Half an hour later Brother Lucius was awakened by an explosion . Jumping into his trousers , he rushed out of his room to find the corridors thick with smoke , flames shooting through the building , most of the other ground-floor sleepers rushing out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brother Lucius ran out . too . But Brother Rosaire dashed to the infirmary , picked up a sick boy , crawled along the hot floor to a fire escape . And to the chapel ran another priest to save the Host . Watchman Quesnel was so confused that he forgot to call firemen . Not until a belated laborer returning home saw the flames from the street at 2 a. m. was the alarm sounded . By that time a half-dozen priests and the 85 boys were trapped in the upper stories . <P> As the firebells rang through the frozen , snow-packed town , the villagers , many of them relatives of the boys in the burning building , gathered screaming before the school . Firemen with ladders were driven back by the flames . A water hose caught fire . Horrified , the town looked up helplessly into the faces of dying boys . <P> There was pandemonium in the dormitories . In the dark rooms , filled with smoke , the boys ran back &; forth , overthrew their beds , screamed from the windows .

Some of the boys , clad only in nightclothes , also jumped from the windows , crawled , with broken legs and backs , as far as half a mile through the snow . Crowding the fire escape , screaming boys ran in their bare feet down its red-hot rungs . Some of those who descended were licked off by flames from the windows . <P> Meanwhile Brother Paul Armand , in charge of " les petits " ( the younger boys ) , led his lads onto the roof of a four-story wing from the attic . There he herded them to the edge , urged them to jump . A few did . Brother Armand was still standing heroically with five or six who remained , when the roof fell , plunging them into the holocaust . <P> At 3 a.m. , the statue of the Sacred Heart in the tower pinnacle toppled over ; there was left only the stark front wall of the tower , behind it a heap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For four days , while French newspapers described the disaster as " un sauve-qui-peut dans la nuit " ( an every-man-for-himself in the night ) and demanded to know why small boys were quartered in the inaccessible top stories , firemen dug unrecognizable bodies from the ruins until the toll of death was five priests , 41 boys .
