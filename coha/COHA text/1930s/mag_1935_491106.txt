0 NE queer October day several years ago a companion and I , with pack on back , tramped northward along the jagged crest of the Black Mountain range in North Carolina , which is really one long mountain with a row of stony pinnacles , fourteen of which rise to more than 6000 feet above sea level . It was a lovely wilderness then , as yet untroubled by concrete roads or tourists . From the 6700-foot hump of Mount Mitchell we scrambled by a dim and sometimes nonexistent trail over the Black Brothers , Balsam Cone and other saw-toothed summits to Mount Celo , the northern outpost of the range . All day the valley to the eastward was filled to the brim with fog , while overhead and to the westward the sun shone brightly , and fold after fold of the vast blue Appalachian panorama lay touched with its smiling yellow light . To our right we could not see forty feet into the fog ; to our left we could look forty miles across the serried ranges to the peaks of the Great @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surged and eddied among the spruces and rhododendron at our right shoulders , flinging a tattered spray of mist through the gaps , but never quite winning over the crest . It occurred to me that this in some measure symbolized the movement of the fate-buffeted Southern mountain folk , driven westward by their craving for freedom and the open spaces , halted forever in the hills by their nostalgic love for the rugged steeps and ledges , for the sighing of winter winds through hemlock boughs , the shouts and murmurs of brawling streams deep in dusky gorges . Three centuries ago , the American frontier was just outside the tiny villages of Boston and New Amsterdam . In another century it had advanced but little further . And then the republic was born and grew like Jack 's beanstalk . Another century and a half , and the outpost line of civilization had swept across to the Pacific coast ; its mining camps and cow towns had seen their rowdiest days and were settling down to orderly government  --  and old-timers were declaring mournfully that there was no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ DUT as the covered-wagon pioneer , the trapper I ) and prospector , the railroad and the capitalist strode across the continent , turning the wild prairie and forest into blossoming fields and cities , all linked together by a web of steel and wire , they left behind them in the Southern Appalachian mountains a people " beleaguered by Nature , " " the world forgetting , by the world forgot " ; pioneers whose mode of life changed but little from generation to generation , whose manners and customs were those of the eighteenth century , whose songs were even older and some of whose words and phrases dated back to the time of Chaucer and Piers Plowman . Those who halted in the mountains during the early covered-wagon emigration often did so because of some accidental circumstances  --  a wagon broke down or someone of the family was taken ill , and a temporary camp was made which finally became a permanent one . Many of those who stopped thus were attracted by the landscape , too  --  usually recent immigrants or the children of immigrants from Scotland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from Wales  --  hill-country bred for generations , folk to whom the green-clad Appalachians looked like the hills of home . Economically , theirs is a dour and churlish land , never intended for agriculture save in a few fertile coves and narrow valleys  --  a terrific challenge to pioneers with only their two hands to produce everything they need  --  but they have loved it and clung to it as a wild bird does to its nest . Yet in recent years , many thousands of them , dazzled by the promise of a regular income , have left those beautiful highlands  --  which can be so cruel , too  --  to labor in near-by lumber camps , cotton-mill towns and coal mines , and to find , especially in cotton and coal , often a more drab , toilsome and unhealthy existence than they had known before . And upon those who went to the coal mines has now fallen the tragedy of unemployment , famine and despair . For a century and more after they settled in the Southern mountains , these people pursued , with but little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and , incidentally , of the forefathers of most Americans . The tides and currents of an increasingly mechanistic and sophisticated civilization swirled around them , but left large areas of their Appalachian fastness almost untouched . They built their own homes , outbuildings , mills , shops and churches of logs , roofing them with long shingles hand-split with Prow and maul from great blocks of white oak ; they made their own furniture and utensils . There were mountain coopers , mountain tanners and leather workers , iron workers and gunsmiths , even an occasional mountain potter . Either under the home roof or by a neighborhood artisan , shoes , churns , pails , spinning wheels , mill wheels , millstones , yarn reels , baskets , plow frames , carts , sleds , boats and other necessities wore fashioned , with few mechanical aids other than a blacksmith 's forge , and now . and then a horse-power lathe . Not so many years ago , down in Hog-Jaw Valley , which lies between Turnip-Salad Ridge and Sand Mountain in Northeastern Alabama , there was an old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you would wish to see , and of excellent tone . An infrequent calico dress for a woman or a few yards of jeans for men 's clothing , an edged tool , a hammer , hoe or plow point , a bit of sugar , salt , tobacco , coffee or sulphur and a bottle of some sort of " bitters " or other cure-all  --  these were the only purchases made by most families from the country store  --  and some bought almost none of these . Where Time Stands*Still TF A SALT lick was near by , they boiled their own I salt , and I have known mountain families in very recent days whose only " sweetenin ' " the year round was honey  --  either domestic or ravished from wild bees ' hives in hollow trees  --  though there is occasionally a taste of homemade cane molasses in the better farming districts . Wild game , including bear and venison , fish and their own fowls and hogs , comprised their flesh foods . Corn , their only grain , is grown on sidelong fields whose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protected with a large stone to keep the stalk from washing away , and men and women kneel on one knee while hoeing . It is a solemn fact that mules have been known to stumble while plowing and roll clean out of the field . The women of the hills spun woolen and cotton yarn , knitted all the household stockings , and dyed and wove coarse cloth and beautiful coverlets whose patterns are much sought after today . I knew not long ago a woman living on Walden 's Ridge within twenty miles of Chattanooga who was still spinning wool yarn and knitting all the family 's winter hose . And there are a few old looms left  --  all home-built , of course  --  thumping away in backwoods communities , mostly devoted to the weaving of rag carpet now , though I recall one century-old machine  --  its frame of dogwood posts with the bark still on them  --  which turned out many yards of cloth for petticoats for the women in the devastated regions of France and Belgium just after the World War . The pioneer log @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sashes were too expensive , too difficult to bring in over alpine trails , to be practicable . Some of those windowless cabins still stand and are inhabited . The lack of windows brought about the leaving of the cabin door open even on many winter days . so that daylight might supplement the light of the wood fire ; likewise betokening the open-handed hospitality which once Prevailed in the mountains  --  a hospitality not quite as freely offered as it once was . In those tiny log houses in their crude rustic communities , sometimes so scattering that an urbanite would not call it a community at all , minus all modern forms of amusement , the mountain folk , strange as it may seem , found a measure of comfort and happiness , likewise a greater security than many have had since leaving them . Some , with fertile valley farms , had plenty to eat and , despite numerous families , lived rather well in a backwoods way . Their inherited stoicism , their isolation , the brooding mystery , solitude and ruthlessness of the great hills @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sober-faced people , but with curious streaks of gaiety and melancholy . They are lovers of fun and companionship , as anyone who has been present at their dances , play parties , shooting matches or holiday celebrations can testify . My old friend , Jake Sharp , forexample , enterprisingfarrner , miller and fisherman , was a confirmed jokester and cut-up . At his home at the foot of Raccoon Mountain there used to gather regularly on Sunday afternoons a few of his male friends , mostly middle-aged , to play marbles or pitch horseshoes , and I have never seen more pleasant pictures of what we are wont nowadays to call , jestingly , " good , clean fun . " There was never any betting on the games , and I never saw a difference of opinion in which any rancor developed . Mountain Humor rr HE mountaineer 's whimsical hu- 1 mor is seen not only in some of his songs and hoedowns but in place names commemorating some jest , some episode more or less grimly comical or tragic ? Broke-Jug Creek , Tear-Breeches Ridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ouch ! How vividly that recalls certain scrambles through stony thickets  --  Burnt-Shirt Mountain , Jerk ' Em Tight , Hanging Dog Creek , Headforemost Mountain , Bore-Auger Creek , Fiery-Gizzard Creek , the Devil 's Courthouse , and so on . In Cumberland County , Tennessee , two beautiful brawling streams unite whose names are No Business Creek and How Come You Creek . Undoubtedly , there is a story back of each name . But the mountaineer is often poetic , too , and gracefully descriptive in his place names . The touch of melancholy in his nature is evidenced by the frequent recurrence of such names as Lonesome and Troublesome . Desolation , Defeated , Poor Fork , Kingdom Come , Falling Water and Lost Creek are significant names of streams . Craggy Dome , Balsam Cone , the Black Brothers , Lone Bald , Thunderhead , Little Snowbird , Grandfather , Hawksbill , Graybeard and Wine Spring Bald are all mountains lyrically and descriptively named . I asked a mountain man in North Carolina whether a certain bold promontory had a name , and I have a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where it towered a thousand feet above us , and the soft drawl of his mellow , low-pitched voice as he answered , " Yes , hit 's called the Winter Star . " I slow-spoken , unlettered individual in patched and tattered clothing , who inevitably fancy him a moonshiner or a feudist , or both , and who often ignorantly confuse him with the " cracker , " the clay eater , the " white trash " of the level lands , on whom even the slaves of antebellum days looked down . It is difficult for many people to understand that a lank of book learning does not necessarily connote stupidity , and that the mountain man who is so ignorant of science , literature and current events may have quite as keen a brain as the city man who confronts him . As a matter of fact , the blood feud , which has made the mountains so notorious , has been confined to a very limited area . In the pinched little valleys folded between the Cumberland hills , the rapidly increasing colonies , after some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were stepped on , cattle trespassed , there were line-fence disputes , the political cleavages and violence of the Civil War added their poison , neighborhood quarrels broke out , and the tradition of the vendetta , inherited from the medieval Scotch and Irish clans , arose again , demanding blood for honor 's sake . Once a feud had begun , other neighborhood quarrels in the same area were imitatively arbitrated in the same rough manner . That habit of violence has in more recent years caused deplorably bloody episodes during mine labor troubles in that area , and it persists to the present moment in frequent killings on election days . In the other , the major portion of the mountain area , the feud is almost unknown , and conditions are more peaceful than in most of our cities . Mountain Women Mountain women are apt to age early because of hard work and childbearing  --  two incumbencies , neither of which they shun . And yet I have known a number of hale and husky old ladies of the hills ; Jake Sharp 's mother , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tireless tongue always ready with tales of the days when the Cherokees still prowled the woods along the Tennessee . The mountain men have been criticized because women have been seen working in the fields . But John C. Campbell , of the Russell Sage Foundation , after twenty-five years in the mountains , says that to him the women have many times expressed preference for outdoor over indoor work . " As for children , Campbell quotes a mountain woman who said , " Seems like a body ought to have at least twelve , " when an observer hinted that her brood of ten was rather large . A mountain family is , as a rule , close-knit , and there is far less quarreling among its members than in city families . I have never seen a mountain child receive any such vicious cuffs , teeth-clattering shakes and half-shrieked threats and reproofs as I see administered to children any day on the streets of New York  --  children often too young to know what it is all about . The primitive mountaineer is a rigid moralist , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he often finds it difficult to live up to his creed ; but do not fancy that he is a stern parent , for all that . In fact , fathers and mothers are loving and indulgent , often to the point of absurdity . Campbell remembers a woman who walked seven miles to a meeting and carried her three-year-old child , because " hit wanted to come . " Julian Ralph tells of a child who died in the Cumberland hills because , as her father explained , " No one could n't make her take no medicine ; she was a Baker through and through , and you never could make a Baker do nothin ' he did n't want to ! " During the recent distressful years in the mountain mining camps , a welfare worker entered one cabin where the housewife told her , " I 'm glad you come ; we could n't ' a ' held out much longer . " Her husband , an ex-miner , was unable to find work and there was almost no food in the house ; but during @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stalking about the yard . " Yes , " said the woman , " we had some roughness ( fodder and we swapped it for that thar pig , and now the children loves the pig , and he 's all they got to play with , and we hate to kill him for meat , they loves him so . " Was there ever a more delightful instance of tender unpracticality ? And yet the children seldom grow up spoiled . Ingrained tradition , an ever-present picture of stern necessity which must be met , plus some dutiful strain in the mountain character , saves most of them . I am now speaking of the old-fashioned mountaineer , the type still subsisting as farmers and huntsmen in the back country , not those in the mining camps . In those sad communities where the reek of coal smoke , an alien element , mingles with the mists which hide the mountaintops in winter , a weakening of the old fiber is seen . In most of those places , children are exposed to the worst influences of our so-called civilization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , one finds much of the old beauty and faithfulness . In a recent report on a half-dead mining camp , a welfare investigator tells of a little housewife  --  such as I have seen more than once  --  one of many who step into the breach in the home of a widowed father . The dossier on this family reads thus  --  this , by the way , was in late October : THE B ? FAMILY , Ethel , Rachel and Hubert , aged 10 , 0 and 8 respectively , three charming children with golden hair and bright blue eyes . Their father , one of the intermittent miners , is a fine , hardworking man , but can get only one or two days ' work a week , and other times is out frantically searching for jobs in neighboring hamlets . The mother died of pellagra last May . The home was spotless and a cheerful fire was going in the grate . The children 's clothes were ragged , but their faces were clean . Hubert came struggling up the hill with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I should think . " I have to pack all the coal for this family , " he said . The teacher says these children never miss a day at school , rain or shine . But when the weather gets colder and they have no shoes , he does not see how they can manage . Ethel washes out their clothes on Saturday for them to wear the pext week ; Hubert and Rachel must go to bed at such times , for they have only the one garment apiece . For decades there were no schools in the greater part of the mountain area , and when they began to be established , they were widely scattered and very brief as to their terms . Meanwhile , generations grew up with no education at all . The few precious books brought from across the sea all wore out and fell apart , save here and there a cherished Bible or volume of Shakespeare which , luckily , escaped leaky roofs and fire and babies ' vandal hands , but which at last no one in the family knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mere battle for existence , the thousand daily tasks which pioneer life demands . Yet oddly enough , there has been a craving in these recent unlettered generations for knowledge  --  a craving intensified as the twentieth century dawned and the mountain folk became more and more aware of their backwardness. , " We-uns know that larnin ' makes you , " said a mountain woman to an educator , urging him to start a , school in her vicinity . A New Record for A BC 's There are degenerate strains in the mountains , of course , and one finds some idle , some vicious , some unambitious , some dull-witted there , as in any society ; but , in general , there are no people who hunger and thirst after knowledge so eagerly . A thousand stories have been told of how mountain boys and girls have appeared at Berea or other and smaller colleges or settlement schools , on foot , on muleback or in wagons driven by anxious parents , bringing some pathetic little measure of beeswax or molasses or vinegar or corn or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ farm , all that the family could spare , and sometimes more , too , as a first payment on an education . Thereafter , the students work their way . But they have been used to that all their lives . At home , nothing can be attained otherwise ; and , after all , it is n't such a dreadful grind to pay one 's way thus . When exposed to learning , they absorb it as a sponge soaks up water . At THE SATURDAY ( Continood from Pogo GO ) Lincoln Memorial they tell of a student there some years ago , aged twenty-four , who wrote his oration and won a contest in oratory with it  --  a men who , two years before , had not known one letter of the alphabet from another . Instances might be given of youths who went toncollege or academy at sixteen or eighteen and there saw for the first time a bathtub , a telephone , a typewriter and other concomitants of civilization , and who , a decade or two later , were prominent clergymen , educators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story of every mountain college and school is full of romance , loyalty , heroism , sacrifice . Some of them have been fighting for their lives during the past four years . An iron Pilgrimage Every phase of the mountaineer 's life is beset by toil and difficulty . Far from being lazy , I know of no people who possess greater and more restless energy . Horace Kephart , who lived several years among them , says , " Considering the quantity and quality of what they eat , there is no people who can beat them in endurance of strain and privation . They are great walkers and carriers of burdens . One of my neighbors used to walk every week thirteen miles to mill , carrying a two-bushel sack of corn-112 pounds  --  on his shoulder , and returning with the meal . . . . Rarely do we find mountaineers who loaf all day on the doorstep , like so many poor whites of the lowlands . If not laboring , they must at least be doing something , be it no more than walking ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " As an example of energy and love of family , consider old Loon Moore , up on the forks of Little River , in the shadow of the Great Smokies . Many mountain housewives do their cooking in the fireplace all the days of their lives . Moore , after long pinching and saving , had put by enough money to buy a cooking stove for his wife , and there was great rejoicing in the household . But within a year or so the only remaining daughter of the family was married to a young mail in the neighborhood , and Loon and his wife consulted earnestly as to a wedding present for the young couple . The daughter had been greatly pleased with the stove , and there seemed to be no gift within their power to give which would be so gratefully received . They could not afford to buy a new one , but the mother was quite willing to go back to cooking on the hearth again , so that her daughter might be comforted and " pleasured . " The matter decided , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then turned sixty , calmly hoisted the big , jagged thing on his back and carried it the five miles to his daughter 's new home , crossing on the way a rocky ridge nearly a thousand feet in height . " Only had to set ' er down twicet , " said he . " Shucks ! " he added , deprecatingly , when complimented on the feat . " Man that cai n't carry a cookie ' stove that . fur hai n't fatten to have one ! " Many mountain children , when becomingly dressed and groomed , are found to be remarkably handsome . One is forcibly struck by this fact when looking over photographs of schoolroom groups which have been thus cared for . Relief workers and investigators who have gone into the mountains in the past three or four years EVENING POST have frequently mentioned it . One worker , going into a school in a comatose coal camp , where , the children were undernourished , where in late autumn there were few shoes in the room , . almost no hooks and only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Rarely have I seen more attractive children ; bright , alert , interested . " Scholars , scientists , legislators have come from mountain cabins , and many more potentially great men and women have gone to waste there because they never had a chance . I recall one orphan boy , a born mechanical genius , who never had any schooling , and who lived in an isolated spot , far from other human habitation . I first saw him when he was eighteen . He had then built a blacksmith forge in his yard , splitting out the two sides of the bellows from oak with a Frew and maul and completing it with an old leather buggy top . A. thick piece of wrought iron which he had found somewhere had been mounted on a wooden block to serve as an anvil , and with this crude equipment he began repairing and then making the tools with which he and his widowed mother tilled their little plot of ground . A few years later he saw a portable rotary blower forge at a coal mine some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his own . From old tin cans picked up at a country store and unsoldered , he made the blades of his fan and encased it in a drum of wood and tin . Old bicycle sprocket chains , salvaged and pieced together , connected the fan with the wooden treadle operated by his foot . From a thin seam of low-grade coal in a gulch a mile and a half from his home he dug his fuel supply and carried it home in a gunny sack on his shoulder . Old iron from wagons , automobiles , and so on , he begged or picked up , and from it made hammers , hoes , hatchets , an ax and other tools . He frequently came hack from the village where he marketed his farm products , staggering under the weight of old iron ; for there was no practicable road to his place , and the family mule had died , as all horseflesh will do sooner or later . A Backwoods Iron Worker From old wagon tires he produced table and carving knives , and even two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or cow horn . How he achieved the tiny rivets for the handles is hard to comprehend , but he did it . Of course , his remelted iron would not hold an edge long , but he did all that a man could do with it . Gunstocks , a handsome rocking-chair for his mother , a jew 's harp , a banjo , a rebuilt coffee mill , a bell for the razor-backed hog which lived largely on mast in the woods  --  these were among his achievements . An old clock which had ceased to run was given him ; he replaced some parts with new ones of his own manufacture and set it going again , His eyes and fingers found their way to the heart of a machine at once and solved its problem . The rapture in his homely face when a friend and I , on a hike out to his place , took some fine Swiss files , a small emery grinding wheel and other equipment to him , was unforgettable . The mountains of early days were almost entirely self-contained . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' 93 had comparatively little effect on their citizens . Probably many of them were not even aware of the first three crises mentioned , while our more urban society was groaning under them . Buta now the mountain folk have become so enmeshed , so integrated with the great industrial and financial machine of present-day society that they suffer with the rest of us , and worse than some of us . Fifty years ago , the only industry which connected the mountaineer with the outer world was that of logging . Mountain men floated their private rafts down the Kentucky or Tennessee River on the spring flood to Frankfort or Knoxville or Chattanooga ; then , with but a glance at the city , would turn back to the mountains again by rail or on foot . Greater lumbering operations , bringing their own sawmills and building their own railroads , began to invade the mountains thirty and forty years ago ; then coal mines were opened , and those industries were manned largely by mountain labor . A few years later , labor agents lured many families from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ where they have led , on the whole , a rather dreary and misfit existence . The Changing Highland Picture As these industries spread , the mountain man learned to suspect every plausible stranger of snooping either for moonshine stills or for timber or coal lands . He began to wear store-bought shirts , overalls , shoes , even cheap suits of clothes ; he learned the taste of strange , exotic foods ? " a can of them samraons " ? salmon  --  and a package of crackers from the company commissary , for example , for his lunch . He and his family ate more and more " fotched-on " foods in tins and packages . Then came the thick , mail-order-house catalogue and supplied fascinatMg reading and new ideas for whole neighborhoods . Children were going off to school and acquiring polished language , as well as notions about diet , sanitation , child rearing , Lord knows what . The highland picture was changing . Until near the turn of the century , coal was still a comparatively unimportant product in the Southern mountains . But new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mountain men drawn into them as laborers . With the development of the great West Virginia and Kentucky bituminous fields early in the century , coal became a prime factor the mountains . When the World War came on , the price of coal soared to astounding heights and miners ' wages followed it . Hundreds of new mines were opened and thousands more of the mountain farmers and woodsmen came down to the mining towns . To men who had hitherto scarcely ' known what it was to have one dollar to rub against another , the millennium seemed to have arrived . Coal loaders drew from twenty to forty dollars a day , and miners are known to have earned as high as fifty dollars . The effect upon an untutored people was inevitable ; silk shirts , silk dresses , phonographs , electric washing machines  --  yes , and automobiles ! Do not chide them ; you and I both know far more sophisticated folk who were just as dazzled and silly in their gilded prosperity . But with the peace came a disastrous reaction . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the competition of oil , electricity and water power sapped its strength , and the panic well nigh prostrated it . To you who think that the depression began in the autumn of 1920 , the coal miner could tell a different story . Between 1923 and 1927 there were 200,000 men dropped from the pay rolls of bituminous-coal mines in the United States , and a goodly pereentagro of these were in the Southern mountain area . There are some lucky miners today , working and living in model camps , often owned by some large steel or machinery corporation , where hospitals , schools , recreation , garden plots , and so on , are supplied , and life is fairly comfortable . But there are thousands of others who have long had no more than one or two days ' work a week , and some none at all . In some cases , the mine owner is almost as stony broke as the laborer . Welfare workers have come across dead mines in the hills , surrounded by tiny villages containing from ten to thirty families , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " so unacquainted with the idea of anyone 's helping them that they do not think of asking for aid . " There are those who are impatient with the mountaineers because they do not change their environment . " Why do n't they get out of those hills ? " demand certain up-and-coming people who , of course , never resist a new idea themselves . The first answer , dear sir or madam , is that if your family had been static for generations in those bills , you would not know how to get out , and you would be attached to your homeland by ties of which present-day Americans , a nervous and nomadic generation , can have no conception . Emma Bell Miles , a mountain authoress who lived and reared a family in a tiny cabin on Walden 's Ridge , near Chattanooga during my residence in that city , says : " We who live so far apart that we rarely see more of one another than the blue smoke of each other 's chimneys are never at ease without the feel of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ develop , as well as to hunt and wander at will . The nature of the mountaineer demands that he have solitude for the unhampered growth of his personality , wing-room for his eagle heart . " Return to the Land Another answer is that as they get education , many of the mountain folk do leave the highlands . But in these troubled times , even if the others left the hills , where would they go and what would they do ? Some of them have tried it , drifting to cities such as Cincinnati and Louisville , where they merely add to the relief problems of the civic authorities . For many of the mountain miners , their jobs are forever gone . Some new outlet must be found for their labor . There are hordes even of middle-aged men who have spent all their working lives in the mines and have become completely weaned away from the old rustic life of the mountains . Some of the old pioneer handicrafts have been revived by welfare agencies to put idle hands to work and bring in afew dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the outgo  --  chair and basket making , for example . The women are piecing quilts , are even learning to spin and knit and weave again ; many men are cobbling the family shoes , just as our rustic great-grandfathers did . A return to the land seems to be indicated for most of them , and they would welcome it . A welfare agent told me of two fine , stalwart young miners who called at her office one day andbegged for aid in procuring , on some terms or other , a little piece of virgin land in some highland valley . " We 'd cut logs and build our own houses , " said they , " and we could at least live off'n the land , even of we had to go nokkid . " A few  --  but only a few  --  families have been thus repatriated , but the states and counties in that area , like most other corporations and individuals in America , got themselves up to the neck in debt during the Golden Age which ended in ' 29 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people now being moved out of the hills because of the imminent back-flooding of the Norris Dam are in many cases being moved to fertile farms which they have a voice in choosing , and it is hoped that their future state will be as good as or better than their past . Virtues of the Hill Folks I who in years past have rambled on foot through those glorious wilds in Tennessee , North Carolina and Northern Georgia , where lovely old Cherokee names like Cheoah , Chilhowee , Hiwassee , Nantahala , Ocoee , Oostanaula , Santeetlah , Swannannoa , Tuckaleechee , Tallulah and Unakit are as liquid as the streams , as softly molded as the outline of the mountains they identify , I have been a bit resentful at seeing paved roads built through the mountains , bringing speeding and unappreciative tourists , signs announcing that Pop and Mom 's Hot Dogs may be had 500 Feet Ahead , and other curses of this age . I have resented the desecration of those lovely solitudes , one of the few places left where one might escape from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ yet I know that the change was inevitable , and that there will be thousands of really appreciative folk who will enjoy some of the beauties of the mountains now who would never have seen them otherwise . In similar way , I have regretted the passing of the old mountain-folk life . I find myself somewhat in sympathy with Cecil J. Sharp , of the Stratfordon-Avon School of Folklore and Folk Dancing , who came over from England some years ago and spent some months in the mountains , writing down the words and music of old ballads of our remote ancestors , never before printed , which he took from the lips of men and women in scores of little cabins in the hills , When he ran across Carl Sand-burg in Knoxville , Mr. Sharp was in a high state of excitement . " These missionaries with their schools ! " he exclaimed indignantly . " I 'd like to build a wall around these mountains and let the mountain people alone . The only distinctive culture in America is here . These people live ! " And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his book , Machine Age in the Hills , says : If the hill people could harp remained as they were , I for one would have been content to leave them in their innocence , prejudiced but charming , poor but free from civilization 's boredoms and irritations . This can no longer be . The machine age has changed their hill virtues into industrial vices . Not entirely , Mr. Ross . There are still a , few of the old virtues left . But it need not necessarily brand one as an enemy to progress , a hopeless reactionary , if one pauses to drop a tear for the passing of the last vestige of our pioneer folk life , of the rugged individualism which conquered the Western wilderness a century and a half ago .
