MARRIAGE - Leon Blum - Lippincott ( $2.50 ) . <P> If Stanley Baldwin or Ramsay MacDonald had written Marriage , they would never have got to be Prime Ministers . Because Leon Blum is a Frenchman , authorship of this plain-speaking sex treatise , although known to Frenchmen for nearly 30 years , did him no political harm , may indeed have increased confidence in his ability to give leadership to an important French institution . Now , however , with Marriage still selling like wildfire . Premier Blum wishes people would forget he ever wrote the book . The national tittering is beginning to get on his nerves . What Frenchmen titter at is the self-portrait of youthful **25;13120;TOOLONG Blum sowing his wild oats . What is not so titillating or so new . but only a little on the old-fashioned side of Gallic good sense , is his sex theory . A succes de scandale in England since the first translation appeared there last month , in the U. S. Marriage will likely perk up more ears than it burns . <P> Sex reform , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can be won " simply through progress in ideas about morality . " Veering even more sharply from orthodox Marxist sex doctrine is his belief that , since the " upper and middle classes " control public opinion and show the highest sex illiteracy , education must begin at the top . And of this group , since its men are already groping along the right track , " it is upon girls . . . that I rely for carrying out the reform which I suggest . ' ' <P> Sample guides for girls : A woman is no less rash than a man if she marries before she has sown her wild oats . Sowing season : ten to 15 years , beginning at the age of 15 . Purpose : to exhaust the " polygamous instinct . " which is probably stronger in women than men . Harmony in marriage depends on " bodily adaptation , " which depends on the sexual tact of the husband , which depends on his premarriage initiation , which is usually bad . To end this vicious circle , let girls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with love before you become good , unless you want love to take you by surprise at an age when to love is not a very good thing to do . " <P> In sex education , a lover is " preferable to a professor of physiology . " <P> Too many virgins and too many prostitutes are two sides of the same counterfeit coin . <P> Separate rooms are superior to double or twin beds . <P> Rousseau 's maxim : " Among moral peoples , girls are of easy virtue and wives of strict virtue . Among immoral peoples , the contrary is the case . " <P> No library philosopher . Author Blum quotes sparingly from such pioneers of sex thought as Balzac , Rousseau , Stendhal , prefers his own sex data gathered " for years . " Liveliest example of data-gathering by M. Blum , who " used to be very fond of following women , " is his description of how in two hours before her train , a charming pickup gave him an insight into the " amorous unrest " of young brides . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ college friend .
