( SHANGHAI is the place where everybody you meet tells you you must go to Peking . Only , they say " Bay-Ping " and you smile knowingly and say , " Of course . Certainly , " the way I do when a young lady comes up to me and says , " You re-member me ; I was talking to you at the party last night , " and I say , " Of course . Indubitably " ? be-cause I could n't have said indubitably last night . And I continue , " Very interesting . Very interesting , indeed , " and she says , " I do n't think so , because , look , do you know what you were talking about ? Tulips ! Double tulips ! You backed me into the AND then they try for half an hour and you realize that they were right in the first place . They ca n't describe it .

There are also two hotels , and Shanghai is divided into two camps . You soon learn that you have to make up your mind whether you are going with the Grand Hotel mob or join up with the Wagons-lits gang  --  pronounced " Vagong-lee " in Shanghai and " Wagon-slits " in Bay-Ping . After some mighty fine rushing , I found myself pledged to the Grand Hotel before I left . For go I did , but it was n't so easy . Sometimes I envy you folks back home . You think you have your little troubles , but just suppose you were having yourself a whale of a time in Shanghai and there was conspiracy afoot to get you out of town and clutter you with culture . And then suppose you finally broke down and said , " All right , all right , I 'll go . I 've got the idea . Shanghai is not China . I 'll go to Bay-Ping . How do I get there ? " And then suppose you learn , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you can go by boat , or you can take a plane . Well , I felt the same way . I was terribly confused . Then suddenly I was greatly relieved . " Thank God , " I said , " I ca n't make up my mind . " It 's the old story . Any time I go to a place and there are more than two ways of getting out , I stay where I am . Many times I went to Havana for three days and stayed three months . I went to Hollywood for six months and stayed a year and a half . I went to Woodstock , New York , for Thanksgiving dinner and stayed . ten years . I slopped off in Chicago once to change trains , and seven years later I woke up and found myself with a house in Highland Park . When I looked around , there was a wife and two children in it .

Well , anyway , this morning I woke up with the feeling that something was going to happen to me. 1 did n't know what it was , but I knew 1 was n't going to like it . After my usual brisk morning exercise , which consists chiefly of crawling under my bed to retrieve my slippers  --  why slippers crawl under the bed and not into the middle of the room , I 'll never know  --  the fog lifted and I knew what it was . I was definitely and inexorably committed to leave Shanghai and go to Peking . I had also narrowed my choice of transportation to either the train or the plane . I also knew I could n't take both , and yet I had to gu . There was that farewell party last night .

" As soon as I pronounced those romantic words , I regretted my decision . Why should n't I take the Shanghai Express ? It would be full of spies and opium smugglers . Anna May Wong would be on board , too , and so would Marlene Dietrich , and the whole troupe would be under the personal direction of Joseph von Sternberg , with sound effects by Paramount . I recalled the original Shanghai Express , produced in Hollywood , which made the Chinese so jealous , they banned it . They said it was n't anything like the real Shanghai Express .

Then the third division of racketeers swung into action . These were the fences  --  nearly a dozen of them  --  operating what appeared to be legitimate brokerage houses , warehouses and even retail stores . Since the combined gang had its bands in a variety of enterprises , there must be an equal number of wholesaling and retailing outlets . These included the high-powered activities of a paper company , a rayon concern , a storage-and-warehouse firm , several place , we ca n't distinguish it from downright nonsense .

" True , and if I had been to Shanghai , I would never make the picture . I do n't want to know anything about Shanghai , and I do n't want to know anybody who does . I 'm going to make a Shanghai Express that looks Like an American 's idea of what a Shanghai Express should be . " And he did . And the Chinese did n't like it at all , but all the rest of the world was crazy about it . Which , I think , definitely proves that " Within the four seas all men are brothers " and " The knees of the gods grind slowly . " Over the Good Earth But I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Shanghai to Peking in order to see the Chinese countryside , and a dozen transcontinental flights from Los Angeles to New York and back have taught me one thing  --  the only vacant seats are in the middle and all you ever see below you is the wings . Now , the wings of the modern transport ship are mighty pretty things , and when I am an angel and with the angels stand , a. crown upon my forehead , a harp within my hand , I hope I have a pair of wings half as nice . But in any case , I will be flying under the wings , like all the rest of God 's chillun , and not sittin ' up above ' em and trying to peek around the edges of ' em for all eternity . I took a little four-seater cabin job that skitters up and down the China coast , and we  --  the other passenger and I  --  had an American pilot and a Chinese copilot . We came down in all sorts of odd places , and since I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all . There was Moochow , Boochow , Loochow , Choochow and Chowchow . Each of these towns consists , if you are flying , of the large vacant field in which you land and which will be entirely surrounded by one million Chinese . It may interest you to know that there is no single city , village , or vacant lot in China that has less than a million inhabitants . grocery corporations , a trading corporation and two neighborhood-store chains designed to place the fruits of robbery straight into the hands of the consumer . At the time an investigation was started by the Department of Justice , legitimate manufacturers had been robbed of more than a half million dollars and merchants had suffered to an even greater extent through crooked competition . The investigation was a long and costly one . Of the forty-five defendants involved  --  crooked accountants , crooked To the right and left of us as we flew along , we saw many walled cities . The walls were mud , the houses were mud . These cities were named Hoochow , Noochow , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other directions was a place called Nanking , but we never saw it . I asked the pilot about it , and he turned around and hollered , " What ? " and I hollered " Nanking ! " and he hollered " What ? " and , of course , by that time , nothing could be done about . it . So he tossed the wheel over to his Chinese collaborator and the plane immediately turned on its left side and started for a large grave in the middle of a rice field . " Never mind , " said the American pilot . " He always does that at first , until he gets used to it . " And the pilot sat down on the edge of my seat , put his arms around me and soothed me in a fatherly manner . " There , there , " he said , " the Chinese have got to learn to fly , and how are they going to do it if we do n't give them the stick once in a while ? " I said that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ What I really meant was that the Chinese had got along for 4000 years without flying , and could n't they control themselves for at least two or three weeks , until I left the country ? " They make very good flyers , " said my American friend , as the plane swooped and zooped . " I think it 's because they are not conscious of how dangerous it is . " " Now I understand your friend up there , " I said. , in a hollow voice . " Let me go up and tell him the facts of life . " " He 's doing fine , " said my American . " I 'm very proud of him . " Just then we skated over another little walled town called Wheechow . There was a street fair , or a circus , or something going on , but when we landed , all the inhabitants left the circus flat and twined themselves around our propellers . All the older women toddled around on bound feet , and the men were all wrinkled with curiosity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty deep in the good earth ourselves , thanks to our Chinese copilot , but we finally shook ourselves loose , leaving a trail of Wangs dripping from the wings , rudder and landing gear . China from the air is a solemn sight . As far as the eye can see , it is one huge graveyard . Thousands upon thousands of conical mounds , large and small , scattered singly or in family groups , fill the fields , so there is hardly room for the crops . Literally millions of Chinese are horn , nourished and buried on the same piece of ground , and the mounds , shaped like coolie hats , frighten you with the illusion that the dead are so brokers , crooked promoters , fences and camp followers  --  only eight saw the inside of prison , and the most time that was served by any one person , through the effulgent grace of the parole system , was three and a half years . Adding the cost of investigation to that of prosecution , these forty-five men accounted for nearly 6600,000 of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ considering the sweetness of parole as it droppeth gently as the rain from heaven , the entire time served by everybody concerned reached a total of less than fifteen years . numerous that they are pushing themselves up through the earth to start their weary cycle all over again . I recalled similar graves in the country around Shanghai so numerous as to interfere with the farming , building operations , city planning and paper hunts . It seems that the families whose ancestors are buried in these graves feel that if they can get along with graves in the back yard , they see no reason for moving them to please foreigners . They have no objection to selling you all the ground around the grave , but you ca n't buy the ground the grave covers and you ca n't move the grave . In fact , in Shanghai there is a grave right in the middle of Great Western Road , one of the busiest streets . Which would have floored me no end , if I had n't come from Hollywood , where there is an oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must choose , I prefer a nice quiet Chinese grave in front of the house  --  in the daylight anyway . At night , I 'll take an oil well . I 'm not scared , you understand ; it 's just that I understand oil wells better . Casualties in Camel Upholstery Just before sundown we saw a splash of gold on the horizon . Coming closer , a huge gray wall slowly rose and stretched over the plain . It was high and grim , with many great towers , and inside we saw an ancient city , and inside of this city , another city with roofs all gold in the sun , And then we were looking down on Peking and under us were the gleaming yellow roofs of the Forbidden City . And now you are in Peking , and if it is n't too much trouble , get up off the bed , walk over to your window and look out . Do you see all those yellow roofs ? That is the Forbidden City . Do you see that row of camels strolling down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has just come to town . That 's just a little old last-year 's caravan from the desert , carrying rare-smelling spices and even more rare-smelling Mongols . ( Correction : Three days later you discover they are doing nothing of the kind ; those romantic-looking camels are bringing soft coal from the Western Hills just outside of Peking . ) You 'll see many caravans before you leave Peking . But you wo n't realize it , for camels , like adagio dancers and stage butlers , all , look alike . True , some of the caravans do come from the Gobi Desert , and from the looks of the camels , they do n't enjoy it a bit . Apparently , the Gobi is full of moths who like camels and chew big patches out of them . What hair is left is all bangs and wind-blown bobs which look all right when confined to one or two places , but scattered all over a camel , give him a low-down bedroom look . They lie along the streets in Peking and , as you pass , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you no good to write to the papers about it , for camels have been doing this in Peking for thousands of years , and if the Mings , the Ch'ings and the Sings  --  I mean Sungs  --  could take it , who are you ? But not only do these sons of  --  I almost said the desert  --  snarl at you as you go by , minding everybody 's business but your own , as only a tourist can , but they keep you awake nights roaming through Peking shaking the bells they wear around their necks . Mighty romantic you think , unless you have tried to sleep while they clanged all night . Those camel bells ! I heard them long after I left Peking , principally because my son bought one of them for a souvenir  --  a bell , not a camel  --  and then , with his usual filial devotion , dashed off to Japan and left it in my baggage for me to worry about . For many weeks I carried the darn thing , and every time a boy picked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around in a hunted , haunted way . It . followed me to Japan , too , where I left it in my son 's lap with a long , involved Chinese curse , but not before the Japanese customs officials , who heard it clanging in my baggage , all but threw me in jail for trying to conceal some kind of an infernal machine . Bells seem to follow me around anyway . There was that summer in Middelburg , on the island of Waleheren , off Holland . I had escaped from New York , just two jumps ahead of a nervous breakdown and one jump ahead of Flo Ziegfeld , rest his soul . All I wanted was peace and quiet , and lots of it . So I said to Hendrik Van Loon , whom you could hardly call a peaceful soul , " Where shall I go ? " and he said , " Middelburg , " and I did , and the first man I met as I drove up to the door of the . Abbey Inn was Van Loon . " A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to bed . The Dutch Idea of Music Now , the Abbey Inn , as the name implies , was once an old abbey , and Middelburg is an ancient and picturesque Dutch town where they still wear costumes for their own pleasure and not to amaze the tourists , as in Volendam and Marken . I dropped off to sleep and was awakened by a bunch of bells playing a rollicking little tune , One of those blankety-blank carillons has followed me from Belgium , " I muttered , and put my head under the pillows until it stopped . I had hardly shut my eyes when it started off again with another tune . I jumped up and looked out the window . There , sure enough , was a bell tower , and out of it was coming that deafening blur of overtones which the peoples of the Low Countries think is music . I stood at that window for an hour and refused to believe my ears . Here was a carillon that played not just on the hour and the half-hour and the quarter-hour but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And all night . And besides , it rang up all the hours on the hour and repeated on the half . One week later I was back in Ziegfeld 's office , and I never complained about the Follies again . Back yonder thereaways , I spoke of the Mings and the Ch'ings , It may have sounded offhand to you , and disrespectful , but I did n't mean it that way . When you are in Peking for a few hours , you feel that you have known the Mings all your life . Like Donatello in Florence . Who painted that ? Donatello . Who carved that ? Donatello . Who built this , tore down that , remodeled those ? Who is that hammering on the radiator ? You begin to hate the guy . Does he have to be all over the place all the time ? Still , in the distant future , tourists will be saying , " Who was that guy Edgar Wells who wrote all the books that were published in the twentieth century ? Or was it H. G. Wallace @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will come the ringing cry , " You got us there , pal . " At this point , if you scurry across the campus , quick like a mouse , you will be just in time for Professor McEvoy 's lecture on Chinese history , entitled : Live Long and Dynasty . First Steps in Chinese History " Attention , children . As I gaze upon your honest upturned faces , I realize you do n't know your Han from your Chin . Is that right , children ? " " That 's right , teacher . " " That 's wrong , children . What will you say when you grow up and come to Peking with your old professor , and a tourist from Idaho says to you , It 's beautiful , but is it Ming ? ' and you wo n't know what the  --  I mean  --  you wo n't know what he is talking about ? " " Will he know , teacher ? " " That will do , Chester . We will iirNt take up the Han dynasty , spelled H-a-n . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 200 A.D. , roughly  --  and that 's the way they ran it too . Now I have composed a little cheer for you to learn , since cheers seem to be the only things you students can remember : " Two hundred B.C. they came , Two hundred A.D. they were gone . Who came ? Who gone ? Han . . . Han . . Ran ! " And now , children , I think you have learned all you need to know about . the Hans . Next week we will take up the T'angs , in the same thorough manner , and then the Stings , the Mings and the Ch'ings . Then , when you go to Peking , you will not disgrace your old teacher . On the contrary , even the man at the travel bureau , who apparently has never been out of the Grand Hotel , will say , Aha , one of Old Man McEvoy 's Chinese-history students ; no use trying to sell him a trip to the Ming Tombs . " ' When I was young and charming , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper wads at the teacher . Between innings , I looked at the pictures , and I remember them all , especially the Great Wall , which sprawled clear across China and overlapped on the next page . " Some day , " I said to myself , " I am going there , " and I would trail off in a delicious daydream in which , somehow or other , a Mongolian princess and a white horse were involved . Just how I was going to get a white horse up on the Great Wall never seemed to bother me , nor did persuading a Mongolian princess to cast her lot in with mine present any difficulties . The fact that she resembled Ara Phillips , who had big black eyes and a long pigtail that I used to dip into my inkwell until she was moved away , might have accounted for my devotion . Ara , I knew , would never get on a white horse to please me  --  in fact , all she ever did was let me carry her books and fasten her skates and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sheik  --  whose name I 've forgotten , but who also figured in my Chinese dream , for regularly I tied him to the tail of my horse and dragged him all over Mongolia . That was so many years ago , I expected the Great Wall to be gone before I could get around to it , but no , there it was , looking exactly the way it . looked in Frye 's Geography . It dipped into the valleys and climbed over the ' hills , and every few hundred yards was a great square tower . I used to think the towers were full of Mongolian princesses , but  --  can you bear the truth ? ? they are crowded with Mongolian guides and peddlers selling souvenir post cards , camel hells , water pipes and snuff bottles . At first I resented their presence . I was full of my dreams  --  my white horse and my princess , and my hated rival  --  and I looked from the top of the wall over the hills of Mongolia and saw , with great satisfaction , all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faded , and only the souvenir peddlers remained , and I was yelling " Get out of my way ! Let me see the wall , will you ? " And then I realized that , after all , it was their wall and I was an intruder , and maybe I had better keep my mouth shut and be polite . A lot of smart alecks had been thrown from the top of that wall and the present crop of Mongols looked quite capable of carrying on the tradition . Not only capable but at . times I caught a gleam in their eyes that made me think they were more than anxious . Something De Mille Missed At this point I have it in my heart to spare you statistics , I will not tell you how long the Great Wall is , nor how high , nor how thick . If you want . to know when it was built , who built it , and why , sufficient that it was n't Cecil B. De Mille . In fact , I suspect . it would even impress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just what the boys in the publicity department mean when they say " colossal . " But I will tell you it is only a short ride on the train from Peldng , or you can fly up and see hundreds of miles of it from the air in just a few hours . And it is n't the Great Wall at all ; it is really the Long Wall . The wall around Peking is the Great Wall . Also , if you go up to it on the train , you will ride in a unique observation car , which is really a flatcar with a roof and equipped with regular office swivel chairs full of lunches and cameras and long-legged English hikers  --  male and female , created He them  --  plus at least three dozen Japanese , twenty-four of whom wilt carry cameras and twelve brief cases , and/or vice versa . Incidentally , if I were going to start life all over again cries of No . No . Shame ! I would go to Japan and manage to get the Japanese concession for any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 2 ) cameras , ( 3 ) top hats , ( 4 ) frock coats , ( 5 ) gold teeth . So I got off the train at Nankou , loaded down with snuff bottles and camel bells , and climbed into the waiting auto for a ride cross country to pay my respects to the late lamented Mings . Up to that point I did n't know the Mings very welt , but after that ride we touched hands across the centuries . Poor old Mings . It was close and stuffy in Peking and you were only going out for a ride in the country . And how you suffered ! I can hear your cries of anguish as your royal bones rattled over the rough granite slabs . I can see you tossed into the air as you dashed over the stone bridges that arch so EVENING POST beautifully in paintings , but jolt the daylights out of you in real life . I can see you , shattered and mangled and choked with dust , finally reaching a haven in those hills . " Put me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Glad did I live and gladly die , and I lay me down with a will . " And one more Ming Tomb rose , elegant and impressive , a lure to tourists like me , who after making the same trip over the same road  --  bids for resurfacing submitted in 849 A.D. , but never opened  --  murmured feebly on arrival at the nearest tomb : " Move over there , Ming ; I 'm coming in . " If you want to start an argument with anyone in China , you ca n't do any better than make some positive statement about the cooking . Pick up your chopsticks , and just before you reach for a shark fin or a bear paw , say , " But as everyone knows who knows anything about Chinese chow at all , Cantonese cooking is much better than Pekingese " ? or vice versa . Immediately , there is an uproar . Fists pound , dishes jump , the air is full of sweet and sour fish , and the tablecloth a sea of soya sauce and sunflower @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice crying , " Ah , but the Fukienese ! " and another repeats the old Chinese recipe for a full life , " You get your wife in Sooehow " ? famous for its beautiful women ? " get your clothes in Hangchow , get your food in Kwangchow " ? Canton ? " and get your coffin in Luchow " ? famous for its wood . The loudest Cantonese present  --  and that can be mighty loud  --  roars , " What do the Pekingese know about food ? Ducks , that 's all you can get in Peking , and slabs of Mongol mutton ! " Well , that 's all right too . In most places a duel is a duck , but not in Peking . There , a duck is a work of art . With true Chinese contrariness , it is broiled behind the flame instead of in front as we do it , and then it is brought in and presented as though it were a first-born heir . Then it disappears and you never see it again . Instead , the waiter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You eat that . He brings more . You eat that too . Then come thin slices of the meat , melting , delectable , delirious . . . . Where am I ? In Peking , thank heaven ; bring on some more . Forty Rounds of Food There is nothing in the air , on the earth or under the sea that the Chinese ca n't cook and make you like it . And a Chinese feast is something to approach with genuine awe . " The regular ' chic-lisu , ' or ' mat of wine , ' consists of between thirty or forty courses of food , " says Jermyn Chi-Hung Lynn , an authority on Pekingese customs ; " besides these , there will be one dish of almonds , another dish of melon seeds , four dishes of fruits , and also four dishes of cold food such as ham and salt eggs , " Among the four cold dishes , that of ham is considered the most important . It must be placed directly before the guest of honor . In the absence of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But this is merely an appetizer , Comes next a huge dish of shark 's fins . I do n't know the name of the unsung hero who dared to eat the first shark fin . He must have been the same intrepid adventurer who ate the first oyster  --  there could n't be two such brave souls in history . But shark fins january15,7936 are mighty good and very , very expensive , and this will be the most important of the forty or so courses . Your host will now toast you . You will " ken-psi , " or empty your cup of warmed wine . And with the appearance of each course , you will be expected to kan-pei again . Also , you must exchange cups in kan-pei with anyone who asks you . Or the first thing you . know , someone has started to play " fingers " ? an old Chinese game in which the loser must drink . But the food has only started to come . Presto , a bowl of swallow 's nests , and after that come the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , pig 's loins . And then two kinds of sweet refreshments  --  hot orangeade will be one , believe it or not  --  and then two kinds of pies , and then ten " big bowls , " such as pork balls , fish balls . Are you listenin ' ? The big fish is coming now . When you see the fish , you know that the end of the meal is in sight . Comes also a duck in a bowl . Then , and only then , are you expected to eat rice , but first everyone must dry the cups once more , and with the rice come another four " big bowls " known as " fan-rsoi , " or rice courses . The Forbidden City I may have forgotten a few odds and ends , but your Chinese host will have forgotten nothing , except , perhaps , a big bed in the next room , to which you could feebly stagger and upon which you could quietly collapse for about a week . As for the Forbidden City , I almost missed seeing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ only a three minutes ' ricksha ride from the hotel . But then , I have lived in New York and never visited the Statue of Liberty . I have walked right by the Empire State Building a hundred times and have yet to go inside . I lived on the South Side of Chicago for years and never saw the stockyards . Nor a gunman , for that matter . And a year and a half in Hollywood , and I never laid eyes on Greta Garbo . The Forbidden City is a fabulous collection of palaces and courtyards , treasure houses , eunuchs ' quarters and eoncubinaries  --  I suppose you 'd call ' em . The whole , surrounded by a high wall , forms a city within the city . Any returned tourist can describe it for you  --  not only can but try to stop him . And if you are a collector of signs , you can have this one , which is posted all about : 1 . NO smoking in Palace are allowed . 2 .

In the morning , you wake up with the firm conviction that during the night you had a guest who was eating Swedish health bread . Yes , Peking is quiet and old and mysterious . Behind those shabby gray walls are gorgeous palaces and temples . In fact , all your friends in Peking seem to live in a remodeled palace or temple . " What a charming place you have , Mrs. Hussey , " you say ; and she says , " Just a little old palace I fixed up . What do you think of it ? " And you recall Gertrude Stein 's reply to the reporter who asked her what she thought of President Roosevelt , " I think many barn door , as the local tax on roadside advertising is so prohibitive as to have practically wiped it out . of existence .

From **35;812;TOOLONG miles of uninterrupted highway on U.S.17 to New Bern , a miniature Charleston , Battery and all , infinitely old and lovely and sleepy ; buried in huge trees and dreaming of the dim past , when a famous Swiss , Baron de Graffenried , led a colony of his Alpine folks to settle there . By now we had covered 175 miles without seeing a single tourist camp or hamburger hangout . With this remarkable statistic in our pocket , we set out again on U.S.17 to Wilmington , North Carolina , a busy modern city , whose public park , a fine big cypress garden , was built to solve its unemployment problem long before the Roosevelt Administration was hit by the same sort of an idea . From Wilmington , we continued on U.S.17 , which we followed as far as Myrtle Beach . This stretch of road was splendid , with many picturesque , toll-free bridges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .

However , U.S.17 avoids a ferry trip and on reaching Conway , you turn south and start the run into Charleston over a practically deserted road . Keep a lookout for two things : The spot on your right where the Government has planted 10,000,000 trees on ten acres in a Federal reforestation project , and , also on your right , the famous Bell Isle Gardens , where cypress , standing deep in clear water , have been planted with an incredibly brilliant collection of wild azaleas . By the way , I 'd almost forgotten to mention that most of this last stretch you 've still been going over bridges , with plenty of water under them , but EVENING POST things @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Calhoun also lives in a magnificent old palace , or maybe it is an old temple . Another friend of mine has taken over an old monastery and remodeled it , the way we used to fix up stables in Greenwich Village . If your taste does n't go for temples or monasteries , there are some perfectly elegant tombs out in the Western Hills that can be bad , if you do n't object to a ghost for a landlord . Personally , I should think he would he the very best . Lind of a landlord . He probably would n't appear , except on Halloween , and then you could he ducking for apples . But if you really seek seclusion and quiet  --  if you want to get away from it all  --  if you long for that peace that passeth all understanding  --  go and live in the Legation Quarter . Here the British play tennis without a sound , no tolls on them . But in order to reach Charleston itself you have to pass a toll bridge  --  fifty cents  --  a two-span bridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high enough for the largest ships to pass under , and from it one gets an aerial view of the city ahead almost equal to that obtainable from a plane ; and the second span is quite high enough also , thank you . Charleston is still the one and only Charleston of old memory , the saints he praised ! All its beauty remains untouched , except where the wave of thoughtful restoration which seems to be sweeping the South has healed some of its gaping wounds . This new preference for restoring rather than modernizing our Southern cities is a splendid trend , and apt , I think , to be more permanently profitable in the long run . If you have n't been to Charleston before , please keep in mind that it is physically impossible to get any idea of it by speeding along the main route . A detour to the Battery only takes a very few minutes out of the most hurried driver 's schedule , and , if you are willing to sit a while in one of the parks , Charleston will flow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even the most dense observer must notice their fine flavor . In Charleston , the grandeur of the Old South is more persistently evident than in any other place of which I know . Our friend , U.S.17 , takes one out of Charleston along a road overhung for miles by ancient shade trees which form a shadowy green tunnel . Watch your speedometer carefully , because there is a tricky turn-off on a fine new road just thirty-six miles out , where you turn left on S.C.32 for thirty-two miles , to the point where it joins up with U.S.17 again , on which you find Savannah , Georgia . To me , Savannah is the most charmingly laid-out city in the Southland ; indeed , it is one of the best bits of city planning in the world . Every other street , one encounters a park , well planted and cared for , and the whole place is just sufficiently time mellowed to be at once modern and quaint . And by the way , we encountered the darnedest menu that I have ever seen in my life @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't resist giving a few of the items on it . January i6 , ! gas and the Americans bathe in their pool without a splash  --  even the Italians ca n't be beard . No news comes here from the outside world . The capital of China is Nanking , but certainly nobody in the Legation Quarter has heard about it . Soldiers , sailors and marines of a dozen nations march and counter-march . Cliques and intrigues carry on ; diplomats glide hither and yon ; official teas and dinners are held ; and on Saturday night , the Grand Hotel is full of gold braid and decorations . Wistfully gay in a spectral way  --  a ghost ball in a ghost capital . Yes , Peking is old and gray and quiet . Spelled " P-e-i-p-i-n-g " ? pronounced " Bay-Ping " ? its meaning is " Northern Peace . " There is nothing to he heard in Peking today except the steady trickle of Japanese , seeping through every crevice in the crumbling walls . Navy-bean soup 4c Jellied-chicken consomnr5 . 6c Fresh spinach Sweet potatoes 4c @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not have been better , and mind you it was well served in a first-class-hotel lounge bar . U.S.17 is still the highway out of Savannah as far as hot , busy , commercial Jacksonville , which has grown to enormous proportions during the past three years , apparently unaware that such things as hard times are supposed to have been universal . And from Jacksonville down one takes up the much-discussed U.S.No.l . There is no other choice from there to Miami . Now for a few facts and figures . To begin with then , the Coastal Route from New York to Jacksonville is just under 1000 miles long . A recent test made by an expert who knew all the short cuts , made a speedometer reading of 959 miles , but ours read more than 1100 because we took all the side trips I have mentioned , and a few others as well . But 1000 is a safe bet for the average traveler , and , as I have said , Norfolk is your logical first-night stop , with a day 's run of 323 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ night out , with a jump of approximately 424 miles behind you . Then Jacksonville is only 273 miles farther on , and , of course , I do n't know which part of Florida you are going to visit , so my advice as to roads really ends right here . From Jacksonville to Miami is another 350 miles , however , if that 's any good to you , with towns , tourist camps and orange juice every few inches along the way . The cost of the trip from snow to sun is small . Although , naturally , big places like Norfolk , Charleston and Jacksonville have hotels to suit all purses , the hostelries of the smaller towns are very reasonable and often offer more charm for less money than the standardized spots . Our expenses for the trip were as follows : This was for my husband and myself . The dog was thrown in free .
