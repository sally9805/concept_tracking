txt After a partisan wrangle over the merits of the New Deal , the House adopted today by a vote of 258 to 88 the administration bill prohibiting suits against the government for damages growing out of abrogation of gold clauses in contracts . The action was taken in connection with devaluation of the dollar . Opposition to the measure was wholly from Republican quarters and passage was never in doubt . As on previous currency and banking legislation , Representative Hollister led the minority floor fight . He spoke against adoption , and also sought to amend the measure so that restriction of suits would be limited to damages claimed under the gold clauses . He maintained ' hat the measure , as drafted , would forbid individuals from ever bringing any suit of any kind against the government over any of its bonds or obligations . His proposal was rejected , 96 to 59 . Later , when Mr. Hollister again tried to obtain inclusion of this amendment and a new preamble in the bill , by offering a motion to recommit the measure to committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote of 250 to 92 . Representative Amlie of Wisconsin , announced that he would vote for the bill , but he wanted to expose the " sophistry and intellectual dishonesty which characterize the support of this measure . " Confiscation Charge Is Made . " We are setting a precedent for the confiscation of the major portions of large fortunes , " he warned the House . Representative Steagall , chairman of the Banking and Currency Committee , retorted that the legislation of 1933 was intended to prevent the confiscation of the homes and farms of the country by creditors . Representative Beed of ? New York told the House that " the violation and repudiation of the pledges made by the Democratic party and by the President are responsible for the dishonorable legislative proposal presented here today . " " It arises out of a series of piratical Executive and legislative acts which were wicked in conception , unjust in purpose , tyrannical in execution and cruel in their results , " he added . " This administration has attempted by legislation and by Executive orders to repudiate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The purpose of the obligations was to enable the government to meet a great national extremity by means of loans obtained from patriotic citizens . " Representative Steagall , sure of plenty of votes to pass the bill , spoke seldom and briefly . He pointed out that , with some $10 , - 000,000,000 of gold-clause obligations outstanding , the government would , if suits were upheld , have to expend about $7,000,000,000 above their face value to pay off holders of these bonds at gold parity . Security Sales Are Cited . In reply to Republican predictions that the bill 's enactment would hinder the future sale of government bonds , Representative Goldsborough of Maryland said : " I wish to God that result would happen . " He told the House that the measure had been expected for some time by the public to be enacted and that this had not hindered the sale of government bonds . He said that $18,000,000,000 worth of obligations had been issued by the government since the gold clause was abrogated in 1933 , and that $50,000 , - 000,000 worth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ From now on , we will have a currency that is uniform in value , " he said . " The passage of this bill stabilizes the currency for the first time in the history of this country , as far as its internal economy 15 concerned . " Money is anything that facilitates the exchange of goods and services . The people 's medium of exchange belongs to the people and no class should control its issuance . " As the House adopted it today , the measure would enable holders of government gold clause obligations to redeem them immediately for their face value and accrued interest , to be paid in devalued dollars . Holders would be estopped from instituting suit in the Court of Claims for damages alleged to have arisen from dollar devaluation , either as to interest or principal on such obligations . The Supreme Court decided in February that claimants must establish that they had suffered actual monetary loss by the devaluation and were not merely seeking unjust enrichment.                 @ @ @ @
