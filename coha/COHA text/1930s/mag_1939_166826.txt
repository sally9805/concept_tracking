Switzerland last week furnished the first notable spy trial of World War II . A brunette dancer called Nina ( real name : Virginia Capt Rota ) , arrested at the frontier as she sought to enter France last month , was found guilty of possessing Swiss anti-aircraft defense secrets . She was supposedly to deliver them by roundabout route to Italy . She was sentenced to five years in jail . With her were convicted Roger Jol , former draftsman in a Swiss arms plant ; Paul Rochat , a Geneva detective , and Rochat 's wife Dolly . In jail , Dancer Nina hunger-struck and tried suicide ( wrist-slitting ) . <P> These malefactors were small potatoes in the international game of espionage . Had they been large potatoes their capture would likely have been kept secret . Certainly Nina , though similarly beauteous and professionally equipped , was no Mata Hari ( Eye of the Morning ) . That curvesome celebrity of World War I did business in official secrets on a grand scale .

She became France 's leading courtesan , sought , kept and highly feed by eminent members of the diplomatic set . French agents saw her in Berlin the day hostilities began , riding triumphantly with Chief of Police Jagow . ( He had originally called on her to complain about her dancing naked in a Berlin night club , remained to engage her for the German Intelligence . ) Back in France , she continued leading her conspicuous life , apparently unafraid . The French knew she was spying but could pin nothing on her . They decided to deport her , whereat she broke down and offered to spy for France . They sent her to Belgium to work on General Moritz von Bissing , the German military governor . She proceeded from there to London where she told the British Intelligence Service she was in France 's pay to spy on Britain . The B. I. S. advised her to stop , let her go to Spain , where she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . They sent her back to France and there , in 1916 , the French caught her with Germany 's check for 15,000 pesetas ( $3,000 ) in her pocket . At her trial she contended this money , like other payments traced to her , was only the price of her love , taken by her lovers out of their espionage expense money . She said she really spied on the Germans for France . She was shot . <P> Nowadays France and Britain are said not to use women spies , believing them unreliable . France claims that the German Intelligence has stooped to hiring dope fiends , whom it supplies with dope , then makes desperate and ready to do anything by cutting off the supply . An ex-spy of higher type believed working now for Berlin is Norman Baillie-Stewart , Seaforth Highlander lieutenant who was convicted in 1933 of selling military secrets and imprisoned in the Tower of London until 1937 , when good behavior ended his five-year sentence and he exiled himself from Great Britain . The London Evening News stated positively last month that Baillie-Stewart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
