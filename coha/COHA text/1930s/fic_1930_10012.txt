THE DOOR THE DOOR 41 " Just the old trouble , " he said , and I noticed that he mopped his forehead . " This wet weather Some years ago he had been thrown from a borrowed hunter and had sprained his back . Judy had always maintained that his frequent retirements to his bed as a result were what she called " too much food and drink . " But that day he looked really ill . " Tell me about Sarah , " he said , and lighted a cigar with hands that I thought were none too steady . He did not interrupt me until I had finished . " You 've had the police , you say ? " " I have indeed . What else could I do ? " " Katherine does n't want it to get into the newspapers . " " Why not ? There 's no family disgrace in it , is there ? That 's idiotic . " He took out his handkerchief and mopped his forehead again . " It 's queer , any way you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? What does he think ? " " He seems to think it 's mighty important to find her . As of course it is . " " And she 'd tied the dogs to a tree ? That 's curious . just where did you say they were ? " IIe sat silent for some time after that . Judy was banging the piano in the next room , and the noise seemed to bother him . " Infernal din ! " he said querulously . And after a pause : " How is Howard ? What does Judy think about him ? " " I do n't believe she knows very much . He 's a secretive person ; Katherine is worried , I know that . " He seemed to ponder that , turning his cigar in his long , well-kept fingers . " This girl who telephoned , this FIorence , she has n't been identified yet ? They have n't traced the call ? " " Not so far as I know . " Asked later on to recall Jim Blake 's attitude that day , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was obliged to saythat it was . Yet at the time it did not occur to me . He was an orderly soul , his life tidily and comfortably arranged , and what I felt then was that this thing with its potentialities of evil had disturbed him , his small plans , possibly for that very afternoon , the cheerful routine of his days . " I suppose they 've searched the lot next door , and the park ? " " Inspector Harrison has been over it . " He sat for some time after that , apparently thoughtful . I realize now that he was carefully framing his next question . " Elizabeth , " he said , " when was Howard here last ! ' Has he been here recently ? " " Howard ? Not for months . " " You 're sure of that , I suppose ? " " He has n't been able to get about , Jim . You know that . " He looked at me with eyes that even then seemed sunken , and drew a long breath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and lapsed again into silence . There was , at the time , only one result to that visit of Jim Blake 's . I called Dick in and told him and Judy Katherine 's desire for secrecy . " Trust mother ! " said Judy . " Keep in the society columns and out of the news ! " But the story was suppressed . Not until Sarah 's body was found , four days later , was there any publicity . The discovery of the body was one of those sheer chances to which I have referred . Without any possible motive for her killing , the police still believed it possible that she had deliberately disappeared . But , as Judy pointed out , there was as little known reason for such a disappearance as for her murder . And then on the Saturday of that week she was found , poor soul . I have no distinct memories of those four days of42 THE DOOR THE DOOR 43nightmare , save of the increasing certainty of disaster , of Katherine 's and Laura 's frenzied suggestions by telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a queer sort of desperation in Wallie which I could not understand . He had joined the police in the search , visited the Morgue , gone through her effects to find a photograph to be sent to other cities . During those days he seemed neither to eat nor sleep , and he grew perceptibly thinner . All his old nonchalance had left him , and at least once in that four-day interval he came in somewhat the worse for liquor . It was that night  --  I do not remember which one  --  that he told me he had written me a letter and put it in his box at the bank . " So you 'll understand , " he said , his tongue slightly thick . " So if anything happens to me you 'll understand . " Judy looked up at him . " You 're lit , " she stated coldly . " Lit and mawkish . What 's going to happen to you ? " " You 'll see , " he said somberly . " Plenty may happen to me . If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " You 're not much to look at just now , " she told him . " You 'd better order him some black coffee , Elizabeth Jane . " She told me later that she did not believe he had written me any letter . But he had indeed . Months later we found it where he said it would be , in his box at the bank . But by that time we needed no explanation . The finding of Sarah 's body was as extraordinary as was everything else in this strange case . Judy had taken the dogs for their usual walk in the park , and somewhere there she met Dick , certainly not by chance . It appears that for purposes of their own they had left the main park and walked through that narrow ravine which is behind my own property , and through which a bridle path follows the wanderings of a small stream . As this ravine lies close to the lot where the dogs had been found , there had been a search of sorts . Thetwo young people , then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intent on their own affairs . In front of them a man on a gray horse was ambling quietly along . Suddenly and without warning the horse shied violently , and the rider went off . He was not hurt , and Dick caught the horse and led it back to him . " Not hurt , are you ? " Judy asked . " Only surprised , " he told her . " Surprised and irritated ! That 's the second time this beast has shied at that sewer , or whatever it is . Twice this week . Yet he 's seen it a hundred times . " Well , he got on again , having led the animal past the obstacle , and Judy and Dick looked at it . At some time it had evidently been intended to raise the road level there , and what they saw was a brick sewer entrance , circular , and standing about seven feet above the ground . " Funny , " said Judy . " What 's happened to that thing this week ? " Dick laughed at her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thinking of poor Sarah . It was a bright cool spring day , made for lovers , and he teased her . It was a part of the game . " I suppose that horse can see things we ca n't see ! " he said . " Why not ? Dogs can . " And at that moment Jock , beside the base of the structure , suddenly raised his head and let out a long wail . They were rather incoherent about what happened after that . It was Dick who finally got to the top and looked down . At first he could see nothing . Then he made out what looked like a bundle of clothing below , and Judy knew by his face . Even then of course they were not certain it was Sarah . They did not come home ; they got the park police at once , and Dick did not let Judy wait after that . He brought her back , whimpering , and I put her to bed and waited . It was Sarah . They never let me see her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ THE DOOR 45She had been murdered . There were indications of a heavy blow on the back of the head , not necessarily fatal ; but the actual cause of death , poor creature , was two stab wounds in the chest . One had penetrated to the right ventricle of the heart , and she had died very quickly . Only later on was I to have the full picture of that tragic discovery ; the evidence that the body had been dragged along beside the bridle path for almost a quarter of a mile , a herculean task ; the inexplicable fact that the shoes had been removed and thrown in after the body ; the difficulty of explaining how that inert figure had been lifted seven feet in the air to the top of the sewer to be dropped as it was found , head down , into that pipe-like orifice ; and strangest and most dreadful of all to me , that the very rope with which the dogs had been tied when I found them , had been fastened under her arms and used to drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was early on the scene , a cordon of police thrown out , and the path closed from the Larimer lot to a point beyond the sewer . But the heavy rain and the fact that the path had been used had obliterated all traces save those broken branches down the hillside which apparently proved that Sarah had been killed on or near the Larimer property . The body had been found at three o'clock , and the medicalexamination took place as soon as it could be removed . The crime detection unit , a group of specialists , had been notified before that removal , but of the seven only one found anything to do there , and that was the photographer . And a gruesome enough exhibit those pictures made ; the waiting ambulance , the mounted men holding back the curious who attempted to break the line , and close-up photographs of that poor body in its incredible resting place . Inspector Harrison , sitting gravely in my library that night , was puzzled and restless . " It 's a curious case , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purse was found with the body , although  --  you say she carried a key to this house ? " " Yes . Inspector , I have been wondering if she did leave her bedroom door unlocked that night when she went out . If that man on the stairs had n't already killed her and taken both keys . " " I think not . And I 'll tell you why . Now the time when you saw that figure on the stairs was at seven-thirtyfive , approximately . You 'd finished a seven o'clock dinner and had got to your coffee . That 's near enough , anyhow . But Sarah Gittings did not die until around ten o'clock . " " I do n't understand . How do you know that ? " " By the food in the stomach . It had been in the stomach for approximately four hours before she died . The autopsy showed us that . But it does not show us where Sarah Gittings was between seven o'clock and ten . Three hours between the time she left this house and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was she doing during that three hours ? Once we learn that , and the identity of this Florence , we will have somewhere to go . " " I have wondered if a maniac , a homicidal maniac " On account of the shoes ? No , I think not , although there may have been an endeavor to make us think that . No . Why did Sarah Gittings take a chair from the laundry and place it in the wood-cellar ? Why did she agree to take the dogs , and at the same time take a rope with which to tie them ? What was in her room that would justify breaking into this house to secure it ? Those are the questions we have to ask ourselves , Miss Bell . " " About this rope , " he went on thoughtfully . " You left it when you untied the dogs and went back for Joseph ? " " I left it by the tree . " " And when you got back it was not there ? " " No . We searched for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't move itself , and it was not where I left it , or anywhere nearby . " 46 THE DOORHe got up to go , and standing in the hallway stared back at the lavatory door . " This Florence , " he said , " she may try to get in touch with you . She reads the papers , and God knows they are full of it today . If she does , do n't scare her off . Find out something . Coax her here if you can , and notify me . " He went back into the lavatory and stood looking up at the ceiling . " A strong man , " he said , " or a desperate one if he got himself out of that shaft , and he may have ; and it took strength to put that body where we found it . " As an afterthought , on his way out , he turned and said : " Strange thing . Both those stab wounds were exactly the same depth , four and a quarter inches . " Wallie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coroner 's jury brought in the only verdict possible . After that and pending the funeral we had a brief respite , although hardly to be called a peace . Reporters rang the bell day and night , and the press published sensationalstories , including photographs of the house . Camera men even lurked in the shrubbery , trying for snapshots of any of us . One they did get , of Judy . They had caught her unawares with a cigarette in her hand , and to prevent the picture she had made a really shocking face at the camera . They published it , nevertheless , and Katherine was outraged . Katherine came down to the funeral . She was shocked and incredulous over the whole affair . " But why ? " she repeated over and over , when we got back from the service . " She had no enemies . She really had nobody , but us . " " Is there anything phoney about any of us ? " Judy inquired . " Some family secret , or something she knew ? " " Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , mother . If we 're all she 's had for twenty years " Fortunately for Judy , Jim Blake came in just then , and THE DOOR 47I sent upstairs for Mary Martin , who had been left to herself for several days , and ordered tea . It seemed to me that we needed it . We were five , then , that afternoon after Sarah 's funeral when we gathered around the tea table ; Katherine in her handsome black , the large square emerald which was Howard 's latest gift to her on one white slim hand , saddened but controlled ; Judy , with her boyish head and her girlish body ; Mary , red-headed , pretty , not too sure of herself and resentful of it  --  it was clear that Katherine rather daunted her ; Jim , well valeted and showing in relaxation some slight evidence of too many dinners and too many cocktails ; and myself . Katherine inspected Jim critically as he came in . " You look tired , Jim . " " Well , it 's been an uneasy week , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it rest at that . Everything attached to Sarah had grown enormous in her eyes ; already she was exalting Sarah in her mind , her virtues , her grievances . " I did n't suppose you 'd bother much . You never liked her . " " My dear girl ! I hardly knew her . " " You never liked her , Jim . That 's all I said . Although why you should dislike the poor dear I do n't know . " It seemed to me that Jim looked annoyed . More than ; annoyed , indeed ; alarmed . Also that Mary was staring at him with a rather singular intentness , and that Judy had noticed this . There was no particular sympathy be , . tween the two girls . Judy , assured , humorous and unselfconscious , was downright and frank to the shocking point , and her small artifices were as open as herself . But there was nothing open about Mary Martin and very little that was natural , save the color of her hair . " Her mind 's always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She poses her very fingers , if you know what I mean . She 's self-conscious every minute . " And if there is one crime in the bright lexicon of modernyouth it is to be self-conscious. 48 THE DOORKatherine , upset and nervous , was gnawing on her grievance like a dog on a bone . " But you thought Howard was foolish to remember her in his will , Jim . " " Nonsense , Katherine . Howard 's money is his , to leave where he likes . Anyhow , let 's hope he does n't leave it at all for a good many years . " That silenced her . She sat very still , with her eyes slightly dilated , facing the issue she had herself brought up ; Howard gone and herself alone . The years going on and she alone . And into that silence Mary Martin 's voice broke , quiet but very clear . " I have always meant to ask you , Mr. Blake . Did you receive the letter Miss Gittings wrote you on Sunday , the day before the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Jim . " She wrote me a letter ? " But he was shocked . A child could have seen it . His teacup shook in his hand , and he was obliged to rest it on his knee . I saw Judy 's eyes narrow . " She did indeed . I went in while she was writing it . " " A letter ? " Katherine asked . " Did you get it , Jim ? " " I received no letter . " He had recovered somewhat , however , and now he turned on Mary sharply . " How did you know it was to me ? Did she say so ? " " No . She was addressing the envelope , and she put her arm over it so I could not see . That is how I know . " " Do speak up , " Judy said irritably . " What 's the sense in being mysterious ? God knows we 've got enough of that . " " Her uniform is still hanging in the closet , and Mr. Blake 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you have to take a mirror to read it . " I do not think any one of us doubted that she had told the truth , unless it was Katherine . And Mary sat there , pleased at being the center of attention , the picture howeverof demureness , her eyes on her well-manicured hands , which were as Judy had said , carelessly but beautifullyposed in her lap . THE DOOR 49 " I do n't believe it , " Katherine said suddenly . " Please bring it down , Miss Martin . " I saw the girl stiffen and glance at me . She was taking no orders , said her attitude , except from me . " Will you , Mary ? Please . " She went out then , leaving the four of us in a rather strained silence . Jim was staring into his teacup . Judy was watching Jim , and Katherine had put her head back and closed her eyes . " I do n't like that girl , " she said . " She is malicious . " " There 's nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got one , " said Judy , with determined firmness . " We do n't know that she sent the letter , but if she wrote one " Well ? " " It looks as if she had had something to say to Uncle Jim which she did n't care to telephone , does n't it ? " Mary came back then , and I daresay all of us felt rather sick when we saw Sarah 's white uniform once more . There is something about the clothing of those who have died which is terribly pathetic ; the familiarity , the small wrinkles left by a once warm body . And in Sarah 's case the uniform spelled to most of us long years of loyal service . Katherine I know was silently crying . Judy was the first to take the garment and examine it . I noticed that Jim did not touch it . Mary had brought a mirror , and I saw that Joseph  --  who was gathering the teacups  --  was politely dissembling an interest as keen as ours . Judy however did not help him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cuff which Mary had indicated , and then silently passed both mirror and garment to me . There was no question of what was there . Somewhat smeared but still readable was the word " Blake , " and while the house number was illegible , the street , Pine Street , was quite distinct . No one spoke until Joseph went out . Then Jim cleared Vs throat and said : 50 THE DOOR " I do n't care what 's there . I never got a letter from her . " " She put a stamp on it , " said Mary . Judy turned on her . " That does n't prove that she mailed it . " But Mary shrugged her shoulders . I thought then , and I still think , that at that moment at least she was sincere enough , and also that she was enjoying the situation she had forced . For once the attention was on her and not on Katherine and Judy , with their solid place in the world , their unconscious assumption of superiority . " You knew her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waste a two-cent stamp . " She was unwilling to give up the center of the stage , however . She said that the uniform might or might not have importance , but that she felt the police should see it . If looks could have killed her she would never have left that room , but she had put the issue up to us and what could we do ? " Certainly , " said Judy shrewishly . " You might put on your things now and take it , Mary ! " And with all eyes on her Mary merely looked at her watch and said that it was too late . When a half hour or so later Inspector Harrison came in he found us all sitting there , manufacturing talk to cover our discomfort , and Mary blandly smiling . We had to give the uniform to him . But from that time on there was not one of us who did not believe that Mary Martin was a potential enemy , and potentially dangerous ; nor one of at least four of us who did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and was choosing to suppress the fact . CHAPTER SIXIT is not easy to tell of this series of crimes in entire sequence . For one thing I kept no journal . For another , I must contend with that instinct of the human mind which attempts to forget what is painful to remember . I do know , however , that Sarah was murdered on a Monday , the eighteenth of April , and that the death of Florence Gunther did not take place until the first of May . How she had occupied herself in that interval we can not be certain ; we know that she was terrified , that at night she must have locked herself in her room and listened for stealthy footsteps on the stairs , and that in daytime her terror was of a different order , but very real . I can find only one bit of comfort . When death did come to her it was sudden and unexpected . She may have been smiling . She must even have been feeling a sense of relief , now that her resolution was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ premonition . Yet had she had only a little courage she might have lived . It is easy to say now what she should have done . She should have gone at once to the District Attorney and told her story . But perhaps she was afraid of that , of being discovered or followed . Then too Mr. Waite was away , and she may have been waiting for his return . We know now that she was hysterical during most of the interval , hysterical and suspicious , that she had built up the crime to fit what she knew , and that the case as she saw it was precisely the case as the police were to see it later on . But we have no details of those terrible days through which she lived from the eighteenth of April to the first of May . On the Tuesday following Sarah 's funeral Katherine SI52 THE DOOR THE DOOR 53went back to New York , and on the next day the District Attorney sent for me . He had some of the papers on the case before him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You had no reason to believe she had any personal enemies ? Anybody who could gain by doing away with her ? " " None whatever , " I said promptly , and told him of her relations to the family . " I would have said , " I finished , " that she had no outside life whatever . " " She had never married ? " " Never . " " I suppose she was in possession of a good many family facts ? I 'll not say secrets , but facts ; relationships , differences , that sort of thing ? " " Such as they are , yes . But it is a singularly united family . " " Save , I suppose , for Mr. Somers ' son by his first marriage . I understand that he is not particularly persona grata . " " Who told you that ? " He smiled . " He told me himself , as a matter of fact . He seems very anxious to have the mystery solved , as of course we all are . I suppose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought so . No . " He coughed . " In this  --  er  --  family difference , I gather that your sympathies have lain with this Walter . Is that so ? " " Yes and no , " I said slowly . " Walter has never amounted to much since the war , and his father has never understood him . They are opposed temperaments . Walter is sensitive and high-strung . Mr. Somers is a silent man , very successful in business  --  he 's in Wall Street  --  and they have n't hit it off . Mr. Somers has financed Walter in several businesses , but he has always failed . I believe he has said that he is through , except for a trust fund inhis will , a small one . But if you have any idea that Walter is concerned in Sarah 's death " I have no such idea . We have checked his movements thit night . As a matter of fact , when he left your house he went directly to his club . He left at eleven-fifteen . He recalls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a minute or two slow . At eleven-thirty he was at his club , and joined a bridge game . That time is fixed . The man whose place he took had agreed to be at home by midnight . " He turned over the papers on his desk , and finally picked up one of them . " Unfortunately , " he said , " your own statement that Sarah Gittings had no life outside your family necessarily brings the family into this affair . Your cousin , now , Mr. Blake . How well did she know him ? " " She saw him once in a while . I do n't suppose she had ever said much more than good-morning to him . " " Then you know of no reason why she should write to him ? " " None whatever . " " Yet she did write to him , Miss Bell . She wrote to him on the day before her death , and I believe that he received that letter . " He sat back in his chair and surveyed me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But why would he deny it ? " " That 's what I intend to find out . Actually , it appears that Sarah Gittings knew Mr. Blake much better than you believe . On at least one evening during the week before her death she went to his house . He was dining out , however , and did not see her . On Saturday night she telephoned to him , but not from your house . We have gone over your calls . Clearly this was some private matter between them . Amos , Mr. Blake 's servant , says he recognizedher voice ; of course that 's dubious , but again Mr. Blake was out . Then on Sunday she wrote , and I have every reason to believe that he got the letter on Monday . " 54 THE DOOR " Why ? " ? " Because he went out that night to meet her . " I think , recalling that interview , that he was deliberately telling me these things in order to get my reaction to them , to watch for those reactions . Later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his to the Grand Jury ; that he said , in effect : " You are to remember that guilt or innocence is not always solved or otherwise by the sworn statements of witnesses . People have perjured themselves before this . The reaction to a question is an important one ; there is a subtle difference between the honest man and the most subtle liar . " So now he watched me . " Did you know , when she left your house that night , that she was going out to meet Mr. Blake ? " " No . And I do n't believe it now . " " You saw the writing on her cuff . Was that hers ? " " It looked like it . I daresay it was . " " Yet no such envelope was found in her room the next day , when the police searched it . Nor among the trash which Inspector Harrison examined . She wrote and sent that letter , Miss Bell , and he received it . Unless some one in your house found it and deliberately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , I did not . " " No , " he said . " I am sure you did not . That is why I know he got it . But why should he deny it ? Remember , I am bringing no accusation against Mr. Blake , but I want him to come clean on this story . He knows something . You might suggest to him that it would be better for him to tell what he knows than to have us find it out for ourselves . " I was slightly dazed as I left , and sitting back in the car I was puzzled . How little , after all , we know of people ! Sarah , moving quietly about my house , massagingme each morning with quiet efficiency ; her life an open book , not too interesting . And yet Sarah had had a THE DOOR 55secret , a secret which she had withheld from me and had given or tried to give to Jim Blake . I decided to see Jim at once and give him the District Attorney 's message . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was in bed . And as it happened , something occurred that night which took my mind away from Jim for the time , and from everything else except Judy . She had been in a fever of anger and resentment ever since Sarah 's death . After all , Sarah had helped to bring her into the world , and she was outraged . I daresay under other conditions I might have found her determination to solve a crime amusing rather than otherwise , but there was a set to her small jaw , a feverish look in her eyes , that commanded my respect . And in the end , like Katherine , she did make her small contribution . To Dick of course she was wonderful , no matter what she did . So she and Dick were working on the case ; she in a fury of indignation , Dick largely because of her . I know that they had gone over every inch of the lot where the dogs had been tied , but that they had found nothing . I think , however , that they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for except for their lack of success they did not confide in me . On that night , Wednesday , they had been making a sketch of the lot and the park , but Judy looked very tired , and at ten o'clock I sent Dick away . Judy started up for bed , but in the hall she must have thought of something and changed her mind . She went back through the pantry , where Joseph was reading the evening paper , and asked if he had a flashlight . Joseph had none there , and she went into the kitchen , got some matches and the garage key from its nail and proceeded to the garage . Shortly after she came back to the kitchen door and called in to him : " Where 's the ladder , Joseph ? The ladder Mr. Walter used in the lavatory that night ? " 56 THE DOOR " It 's in the tool room , Miss Judy . Shall I bring it in ? " " Never mind , " she said , and went out again . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the windows and doors , before going to bed . At the front door he stopped , and then came to me in the library . " I suppose Miss Judy came in by the front door , madam ? " " Miss Judy ! Has she been out ? " " She went out through the kitchen , a little after ten . She said she wanted the ladder ; she did n't say why . " I was uneasy rather than alarmed , until I saw that the garage was dark . " She 's not there , Joseph ! . " " Maybe she took the car and went out , madam . " " She 'd have told me , I 'm sure . " I was for starting out at once , but he held me back . " I 'd better get my revolver , " he said . " If there 's anything wrong That sent a shiver of fear down my spine . " Judy ! " I called . " Judy ! " There was no answer , and together Joseph and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver in his hand . It was a black night and starless ; just such a night as when poor Sarah met her death , and the very silence was terrifying . Halfway along the path Joseph wheeled suddenly . " Who 's there ? " he said sharply . " What did you hear , Joseph ? " " I thought somebody moved in the bushes . " We listened , but everything was quiet , and we went on . In the garage itself , when we switched on the lights , everything was in order , and the key Judy had used was still in the small door which gave entrance from the side . This door was closed but not locked . The first ominous thing was when we discovered that the door into the tool room was locked and that the key was missing from its nail . I rattled the knob and called Judy , but received noTHE DOOR 57reply , and Joseph in the meantime was searching for the key . " She 's in here , Joseph . " " Not necessarily , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Abner takes his tools . " But Judy was in there . Not until Joseph had broken a window and crawled in did we find her , poor child , senseless and bleeding from a cut on the head . Joseph carried her into the house , and into the library . She was already stirring when he placed her on the couch there , and she was quite conscious , although dizzy and nauseated , in a short time . Enough indeed to protest against my calling a doctor . " We do n't want any more fuss , " she said , and tried to smile . " Remember mother , Elizabeth Jane ! Always in the society columns but never in the news . " But as she was violently nauseated almost immediately I got Joseph to telephone to Doctor Simonds , and he came very soon afterwards . She had , he said , been struck on the head , and Joseph suggested that the ladder itself had fallen on her . As a matter of fact , later investigation showed the ladder lying on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wall when she saw it , there was a possibility of truth in this . But one thing was certain ; however she was hurt , she had been definitely locked in the tool room . She had used the key and left it in the door . Some one had locked her in and taken the key . It was nowhere to be found . We got her up to bed , and the diagnosis was a mild concussion and a lucky escape . The doctor was inclined to be humorous about it . " You have a hard head , Judy . A hard head but a soft heart , eh ? " Well , he ordered ice to what she called her bump and heat to her feet , and while Joseph was cracking the ice below she told her story . But although Joseph maintainedthat she had asked him about the ladder , she gave an entirely different reason herself. 58 THE DOOR " Abner has a foot rule in the tool room , " was her story to me . " I wanted to measure the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . So I got the key to the garage and went out . I thought I heard something in the shrubbery behind me once , but it might have been a rabbit , I do n't know . " The tool room light had burned out , so I lighted a match when I went in . The door was not locked , but the key was in it . There was nobody in the tool room , unless they were behind the door when I opened it . I lighted a fresh match , and just then the door slammed behind me and blew out the match . I said damn , ' and  --  that 's all I remember . " To add to our bewilderment and my own secret anxiety , Joseph brought forth something when he carried up the ice ; something which was odd , to say the least . This was that just before ten o'clock , when he let the dogs out the back door , he heard them barking in the shrubbery . This barking , however , ceased abruptly . " As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who now and then lapsed into colloquial English . " Jock now , he 'd never let up if it was a stranger . " But there was something horrible in that thought ; that any one who knew us would attack Judy , and the situation was not improved by Norah 's declaration the next day that , at two o'clock in the morning , four hours after the attack on Judy , she had seen some one with a flashlight in the shrubbery near the garage . The night had been cool and she had got out of bed to close her window . Then she saw the light , and because it was rather ghostly and the morale of the household none too good , she had simply got back into bed and drawn the covers over her head . Inspector Harrison had come early at my request , and Norah repeated the story to him . The flashlight , she said , was close to the ground , and almost as soon as she saw it , it went out . Up to that moment I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condition to accident , the more so as she refused to explain why she had been in the garage . " Come now , Miss Judy . You had a reason , had n't you ? " " I 've told you . I wanted to get the foot rule . " " Did you tell Joseph you wanted to see the ladder ? " " I may have , " she said airily . " Just to make conver-sation . " " This ladder , " he persisted . " It is the one Walter Somers used in the lavatory ? " Judy yawned . " Sorry , " she said . " I lost some sleep last night . Is it the same ladder , Elizabeth Jane ? You tell him . " " It is , " I said flatly , " and you know it perfectly well , Judy . You 're being silly . " But she had no more to say , and the Inspector stamped down the stairs in no pleasant mood and inclined to discredither whole story . For which I did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was looking pale and demoralized , and she said something about witch lights and then crossed herself . The result was that he at once commenced an investigation of the shrubbery , and that his men almost immediately discovered footprints in the soft ground to the right of the path and where Norah had seen the light . There were four , two rights and two lefts , and when I went out to look at them the Inspector was standing near them , surveying them with his head on one side . " Very neat , " he said . " Very pretty . See anything queer about them , Simmons ? " " They 're kind of small , if that 's it . " " What about the heels ? " " Very good , sir . Clear as a bell . " The Inspector drew a long breath . " And that 's all you see , is it ? " he demanded violently . " What the hell 's the use of my trying to teach you fellows anything ? Look at those heels ! A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been planted . " 60 THE DOORHe left the discomfited Simmons to mount guard over the prints and to keep the dogs away from them , and not unlike a terrier himself , set to work to examine the nearby ground and bushes . " The fellow , whoever he was , stepped off the path there when Miss Judy came along . But he left footprints , and later on he remembered them . He came back , smoothed them over and planted false ones . If he 's overlooked one now He was carefully turning over dead leaves with a stick he carried , and now he stooped suddenly and picked up something . " Look at this ! " he said . " The key to the tool room , is n't it ? I thought so . Threw it here as he ran . " He was examining the key , which is the flat key of the usual Yale lock , and now he gave an exclamation of disgust . " Clean as a whistle , " he said . " Pretty cagey , this chap @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but he wiped it first : or he wore gloves . " He stood there for some time , staring at the key . " Well , " he said finally , " we have just two guesses , Miss Bell . Either he wanted to do away with Miss Judy , which is unlikely ; or he did not like her going into that tool room . " " But he let her go in , and he locked her there . " " Not in shape to do much looking about , however , " he said grimly . " Now which was it ? " He glared at me as though he expected an answer . " I 'm sure I do n't know , " I said meekly . Later on I stood by while his men measured the distance between the footprints and made molds of them . They sprayed the marks with something first , and then poured in plaster of Paris which the Inspector reinforced with the inevitable toothpicks . The result was a pair of rather ghastly white shoes , which he surveyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ planted ? " he said . " Well , the stride was too long for the foot , for one thing . Here'sTHE DOOR 61a small foot and a long stride . Then the ground 's soft ; they were n't deep enough . And there 's another point . When a man walks there 's a back thrust to his foot , and the weight 's likely to be more on the outside and back of the heel . Look at me ; I walk in this earth . What hap , pens ? I break the earth at the rear as I lift my foot . " " You might try that , Simmons , " he called . " Maybe the next time you wo n't let somebody put something over on you . " He left soon after that , greatly pleased with himself but considerably puzzled , and carrying the two molds carefullywrapped in a newspaper . His examination of the garage and of the ladder had yielded nothing whatever . CHAPTER SEVENJUDY had been hurt on Wednesday , the twenty-seventh of April , and Florence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was the Sunday following . On either Thursday or Friday of that week , then , Wallie came in to see me . I remember being shocked at his appearance , and still more shocked at the way he received the news that Judy had been hurt . " Good God ! " he said . " I 'll stop this thing if I have to  --  " he hesitated . " If I have to kill somebody with my own hands . " But he would not explain that . He called Joseph and went out to the garage , leaving me to make what I could out of that speech of his , and of his conduct generally since Sarah had been killed . He had searched far more assiduously than had the police , had shown more anxiety than any of us . His gaiety had gone , and he had a hollow-eyed and somber look during those days which I could not account for . Nor did the discovery of the body afford him any apparentrelief . To the rest of us , grieved as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After all , it was over . We could not help Sarah , and the rest was for the police . But Wallie had not appeared to share this relief . Yet Wallie had not liked Sarah . She was not a part of that early regime of which Joseph was the lone survival ; of Margaret and the noisy , gay , extravagant days before she left Howard and a young son both of whom had passionately loved her , to run away with a man who abandoned her within six months . I found myself thinking of those days . I had known Howard even then . Indeed , it was through me that he met Katherine . Margaret had had a brief unhappy year62THE DOOR 63somewhere in Europe ; then she died . And Wallie had needed a mother . But Katherine had not proved to be a mother to him . He had resented her , and she had resented him . She had never liked him , and after Judy was born this dislike greatly increased . It accentuated her jealousy of Margaret that Margaret had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; for Katherine was passionately in love with her husband . And she had kept nothing of Margaret 's that she could avoid . Even Joseph had had to go , and so I took him . Not unusual , I daresay , this jealousy of second wives for the women they have followed , even when that woman is dead . But it worked badly for Wallie . Certainly Wallie was not blameless for his alienation from his father , but also certainly Katherine never raised a finger to restore the peace between them . Wallie was too reminiscent of his mother , fiery , passionate , undisciplined , handsome . When he had learned that Margaret was dying in Biarritz , abandoned by the man for whom she had left Howard , he had demanded permission to go to her . But he was refused on the score of his age  --  he was only fourteen at the time  --  and in desperation he had taken out of Howard 's wallet the money for a secondclasspassage there . He was too late , at that , but Howard never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake of telling Katherine . After her marriage , when Wallie was in the house , she kept her purse locked away . And he knew it and hated her for it . But he was not there very often . First at school and later at college , Katherine kept him away as much as possible . And after that had come the war . Naturally then the relationship between Judy and Wallie was almost as remote as the relationship between Wallie and Sarah . To have him grow morose and exhaustedwhen Sarah disappeared was surprising enough , 64 THE DOORbut to see him grow pale and furious over the attack on Judy was actually startling . He was quieter , however , when he came back from the garage . He planted himself in front of me , like a man who has made a resolution . " See here , " he said . " How fond are you of Jim Blake ? " " I like him . I do n't know that it 's any more than that . " " What time was it when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quarter past seven . " " And he asked for Sarah ? " " Yes . " " Why did he do that ? Was he in the habit of calling Sarah ? Of course he was n't . How do you know that when she left the house that night it was n't to see Jim . Blake ? To meet him somewhere ? " " I do n't believe it , " I said sharply . " Why would she meet him ? I do n't believe they 've exchanged two dozen words in twenty years . " " She went out to meet him , " he insisted . " I know that . I 've made it my business to know it . I 've been talking to that darky of his . You know his habits : you know he dines late and dresses for dinner . Well , that night he did n't . He dined early and he put on a golf suit . And he left the house at seven o'clock . " " Good heavens , Wallie ! If a man may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ likes " Listen , " he said doggedly . " That 's not all . He carriedwith him that sword-stick you gave him . " " Even then " Let me finish , Elizabeth Jane . That cane or stick or whatever you call it , has disappeared . It 's not in the house . It stood in the hall with his other sticks until Sarah 's body was found . Then it went . " He was looking at me with his tired sunken eyes , but there was no doubting his earnestness or his conviction . " What does that look like ? " he demanded . " He hasTHE DOOR 65an appointment with Sarah . He goes to meet her , armed . And then " Wallie , I implore you not to give that to the police . " " No , " he said somberly . " Not yet . But some day I may have to . " This then was our situation , during the few days which remained before the first of May . Sarah was dead , dead of two stab wounds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been stunned by a blow on the back of the head . Judy had been attacked by the same method , a blow on the head from the rear , but no further attempt on her life had been made . Wallie suspectedJim Blake , apparently only because the sword-cane was missing , and my household was in a state of nerves so extreme that the back-firing of automobiles as they coasted down the long hill which terminates at my drive was enough to make the women turn pale . Of clues we had none whatever . Because of the sensational nature of the crime the press was clamoring for an arrest , and the Inspector was annoyed and irritated . " What do they want , anyhow ? " he said . " I ca n't make clues , can I ? And if you 'd listen to the District Attorney 's office you 'd think all I had to do was to walk out and arrest the first man I met on the street . Lot of old women , getting nervous the minute the papers- begin to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hundreds of toothpicks that week . We would find small scattered bits of wood all over the place . By Sunday , the first of May , Judy was still in bed , but fully convalescent . She had ordered a number of books on crime to read , and flanked by those on one side and her cigarettes on the other , managed to put in the days comfortably enough . The evenings were reserved for Dick . Their first meeting after Judy 's injury had defined the situation66 THE DOOR THE DOOR 67between them with entire clarity . He was on his knees beside the bed in an instant . " My darling ! My poor little darling ! " he said . She lay there , looking perfectly happy , with one hand on his head . " Your poor little darling has made a damned fool of herself , " she said sweetly . " And you 'll give me hell when you hear about it . Go on out , Elizabeth Jane ; he wants to kiss me . " Which , Katherine or no Katherine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afternoon that there occurred another of those apparently small matters on which later such grave events were to depend . Already there were a number of them : Sarah 's poor body found by the coincidenceof Judy being near when a horse shied ; the coolness of an April night so that Norah must go to her window to close it ; Mary Martin happening to open Sarah 's door while she was writing a letter , so that Sarah had made that damning record on her white sleeve ; Jim Blake 's deviation from his custom of dressing for dinner and its results ; Judy 's sudden and still mysteriousdesire to visit the garage at night ; even my own impulsive gift to Jim Blake of my grandfather 's swordstick . On that Sunday afternoon , at five o'clock , Florence Gunther came to see me and was turned away . I had gone upstairs to rest , and she was turned away . Why had she not come sooner ? She was frightened , of course . We know that now . Afraid of her very life . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there in the upper room of that shabby house on Halkett Street . But she knew she held the key to the mystery . One can figure her reading the papers , searching for some news , and all the time holding the key and wondering what she ought to do . If she had gone to the police with her story , she might have saved her life . But if all of us behaved rationally under stress there would be no mysteries , and the dreadof the police and of publicity is very strong in many people . And in addition she herself had something to hide , a small matter but vital to her . How could she tell her story and not reveal that ? She must have thought of all those things , sitting alone at night in that none too comfortable room of hers with its daybed covered with an imitation Navajo rug , its dull curtains and duller carpet , its book from the circulatinglibrary , and perhaps on the dresser when she went to bed at night , the gold bridge with its two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end she reached a decision and came to me . And Joseph , who was to identify her as my visitor later on by a photograph , answered the bell and turned her away ! I was asleep , he said , and could not be disturbed . So she went off , poor creature , walking down my path to the pavement and to her doom ; a thin colorlessgirl in a dark blue coat and a checked dress . She had left no name , and Joseph did not tell me until I went down to dinner . Even then it meant nothing to me . " What was she like , Joseph ? A reporter ? " " I think not , madam . A thinnish person , very quiet . " Dick was having an early Sunday night supper with me , early so that the servants might go out . That , too , is a custom of my mother 's , the original purpose having been that they might go to church . Now , I believe , they go to the movies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Martin had rather upset me . She had come in from a walk to tell me that she was leaving as soon as I could spare her , and had suddenly burst into tears . " I just want to get away , " she said , through her handkerchief . " I 'm nervous here . I 'm  --  I guess I 'm fright-ened . " " That 's silly , Mary . Where would you go ? " " I may go to New York . Mrs. Somers has said she may find something for me. " 68 THE DOORJudy 's comment on that conversation , when I stopped in her room to tell her , was characteristic . " Mother 's idea of keeping Mary 's mouth shut , " she said . " And polite blackmail on the part of the lady ! " So Mary had not come down to dinner , and Dick and I were alone . He talked , I remember , about crime ; that Scotland Yard seized on one dominant clue and followed it through , but that the expert American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And he stated as a corollary to this that the experts con- nected with the homicide squad had some clues in con- nection with Sarah 's murder that they were not giving out . " They 've got something , and I think it puzzles them . " " You do n't know what it is ? " But he only shook his head , and proceeded to eat a sub- stantial meal . I remember wondering if that clue involved Jim , and harking back again , as I had ever since , to Waffle 's suspicion of him . Why had he telephoned to Sarah that night ? Could it be that he was , in case of emergency , registering the fact that , at seven-fifteen or thereabouts , he was safely at home ? But we had the word of Amos that he was not at home at that time ; that , God help us , he was out somewhere , with a deadly weapon in his hand and who knew what was in his heart . He was still shut away , in bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that bed ? " Dick , " I said . " You and Judy have something ire your minds about this awful thing , have n't you ? " " We 've been talking about it . Who has n't ? " " But something concrete , " I insisted . " Why on earth did Judy want that ladder ? " He hesitated . " I do n't know , " he said slowly . " I do n't think she wanted the ladder ; I think she must have intended to look at it . " THE DOOR 69Upon this cryptic speech , which he refused to elaborate , I took him upstairs . That evening is marked in my memory by two things . One was , about nine o'clock , a hysterical crying fit by Mary Martin . Clara came down to the library to tell me that Mary was locked in her room and crying ; she could hear her through the door . As Mary was one of those self-contained young women who seem amply able to take care of themselves , the news was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had got the smellingsalts and hurried up to her , she refused at first to let me in . " Go away , " she said . " Please go away . " " Let me give you the salts . I need n't come in . " A moment later , however , she threw the door wide open and faced me , half defiantly . " It 's nothing , " she said . " I was low in my mind , that 's all . " She forced a smile . " I have a fit like this every so often . They 're not serious . " " Has anything happened , Mary ? " " Nothing . I 'm just silly . You know , or maybe you do n't ; living around in other people 's houses , having nothing . It gets me sometimes . " I came nearer to liking her then than I ever had , and I wondered if the sight of Dick , intent on Judy and Judy 's safety , had not precipitated the thing . After all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ patted her on the arm . " Maybe I 've done less than my duty , Mary , " I said . " I 'm a selfish woman and lately , with all this tragedy And then she began to cry again . Softly , however , and rather hopelessly . When I went downstairs again I wondered if she was not frightened , too ; after all , her loneliness was nothing new to her . I can look back on Mary now , as I can look back on all the other actors in our drama . But she still remains mysterious to me , a queer arrogant ' creature , self-con-70 THE DOORscious and sex-conscious , yet with her own hours of weakness and despair . The other incident was when Dick received a telephone call , rather late in the evening . That must have been around eleven o'clock . Judy and he had spent the intervening hours together , the door open out of deference to my old-fashioned ideas , but with Dick curled up comfortably on her bed in deference to their own ! He came @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the next moment he was galvanized into action , rushed into the hall , caught up his overcoat and hat , and shouted up the stairs to Judy . " Got to run , honey . Something 's happened , and the star reporter is required . " " Come right up here and say good-night ! . " " This is business , " he called back , grinning . " I can kiss you any time . " And with that he was out of the house and starting the engine of his dilapidated Ford . I could hear him rattling and bumping down the drive while Judy was still calling to him from above . CHAPTER EIGHTI WAS astonished the next morning to have Clara announce Inspector Harrison before I was dressed . I looked at the clock , and it was only half past eight . Clara plainly considered the call ill-timed . " I can ask him to come back , ma'am . " " Not at all . You have no idea what he wants , I suppose ? " " Joseph let him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But I wanted no coffee . I threw on some clothing Judy was still asleep  --  and when I got down Mr. Harrisonwas standing in the lavatory doorway , thoughtfullygazing up at the skylight . He looked tired and untidy , and his eyes were blood-shot . " I 've taken the liberty of asking your butler for a cup of coffee . I 've been up all night . " " Why not have breakfast ? " " I 'm not hungry . I do n't think I could eat anything . " But he did eat a fair meal when it appeared , talking meanwhile of unimportant matters . Not until we were in the library with the door closed did he mention the real object of his visit . " Miss Bell , did you ever hear of a young woman named Gunther ? " " I think not . Why ? " " Florence Gunther ? " " Florence ! The Florence who telephoned to Sarah ? " " I think it 's possible . I 'm not certain . " " Well , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She must know something . " " Yes , " he said . " Yes , I think she did know something . But she will never be able to tell it . She was shot and killed last night . " Later on I was to wonder why he did not tell me then 7172 THE DOORthe details of that killing . Perhaps he was still rather sick ; perhaps he had reasons of his own . But what he told me then was only that the girl had been shot and that there was some evidence that her room had been gone through , like Sarah 's . The body had been taken to the Morgue . " There are certain points of resemblance , " he said , " although this girl was shot , not stabbed . For instance  --  I do n't want to harrow you  --  but the shoes had been removed . And although her room is not in the condition of Sarah Gittings ' , it had been searched . I 'll take my oath to that . She seems to have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that phrase , very quiet , recalled something to me . Quiet . A quiet person . I remembered then ; Joseph 's description of the young woman who had tried to see me the day before . " I wonder , " I said , " if she could have been here yes-terday . " " Yesterday ? " " How was she dressed ? What did she look like ? Joseph turned away a young woman while I was resting . It just might have been He was in the hall in a moment , calling Joseph , and what I had feared turned out to be correct . Joseph not only identified a cabinet photograph of her , but recalled that she had worn a blue coat , and " a sort of plaid dress , sir ; checked , it might have been . " When he had excused Joseph , who looked shaken over the whole business , the Inspector gave me such facts as he had . Florence Gunther had been shot and killed ; the bullet had gone into her brain and out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and had largely succeeded . A farmer named Hawkins , out on the Warrenvilleroad , had gone out at ten o'clock the night beforeto look after a sick cow , and in a gully beside theTHE DOOR 73road , not two hundred yards from his front gate , had seen a fire blazing . Thinking that a passing motorist had ignited the brush with a lighted cigarette , he went back into the house and got an old blanket and a broom with which to beat out the flames . He had actually commenced this when he realized what lay before him . He smothered the fire with the blanket and called the police . But for the incident of the sick cow the body would have been destroyed , as the family had already retired . As it was , identification would have been a slow matter , had it not been for the one thing which Mr. Harrisonhad said every criminal overlooks , and this was that where the body had been placed a small spring , a mere thread of water really  --  I saw it later @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garments as were in contact with the earth , then , were not destroyed , and they revealed the fact that the unfortunate woman had worn a checked dress and a dark blue coat . There must have been footprints in that soft ground , the heavy marks of a man carrying a substantial burden ; but a passing car with a group of curious and horrifiedmotorists , Hawkins himself extinguishing the fire , the police and police reporters when they arrived , had thoroughly erased them . The three detectives from the homicide squad reached the spot to find the body , a crowd of curious onlookers , and not a discoverable clue to the murder . At four in the morning Harrison went home and threw himself , fully clothed , on his bed . There was nothing then to connect this crime with Sarah , or with us ; nor was there until seven-ten the following morning . The body had been taken to the Morgue , Mr. Harrison was peacefully asleep , and Dick Carter had written his story of the murder and gone to bed , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-ten , however , an excited telephone message was received at a local police station from a woman named Sanderson , a boarder in THE DOOR 75possession of some dangerous knowledge , possibly certainpapers  --  it 's hard to say .

Whether it was found or not " He broke the end from a toothpick with great violence . " Curious thing to think of , is n't it ? " he went on . " If you 'd seen this girl yesterday she might be living today . She knew the answer to Sarah Gittings ' murder , and so she had to go . Now , if we knew how friendly they were , how they met , what brought them together , we 'd have something . " And , although we have learned many things , that associationof theirs remains a mystery . By what tragic accident they were thrown together we shall never know ; two lonely women in a city of over half @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ during their aimlessevening walks , or in a moving picture theater . We have no reason to believe that there was any particular friendship between them . One thing , discovered by accident , held them together and in the end destroyed them . The Inspector got up to go . " I 'm going down to headquarters , " he said . " Then I 'm going back to that room of hers . Whether the same hand killed both women or not , I imagine the same individualsearched both rooms . There 's a technique about such matters . " " Still , I should think that a man who has just killed --  " " Not this one . He 's got no heart and he 's got no nerves . But there 's always a chance . If he goes on killing , he 'll slip up some time , and then we 'll get him . " With which optimistic words he left me ! Later on in the day I heard from him by telephone .

She reported that one of the roomers , a young woman named Florence Gunther , was not in her room , and that as she never spent the night out she was certain that something was wrong . In view of the crime the night before the call was turned over to the Inspector . Breakfastless and without changing his clothing , he got into his car  --  always kept at his door  --  and started for Halkett Street . The San- derson woman , greatly excited , was waiting at the front door . Her story was simple and direct . She had not slept well , and some time in the night she had been annoyed by movements overhead , in Florence Gunther 's room . " She seemed to be moving the furniture about , " she said , " and I made up my mind to talk to her about it in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , but she was n't there . She had n't slept there . And when I found all her clothes except what she had on I got wor- ried . " Iie told her nothing of the crime , but he examined the room with her . The landlady , a woman named Bas- sett , had been ill for some time and did not appear . It was clear to both of them that the room had been searched , although there had been an attempt to conceal the fact . But the important fact was that Florence Gunther when last seen the evening before had worn a checked dress and blue coat . He knew then what he had found . He locked the room , put Simmons on guard at the door , sent word by a colored servant to Mrs. Bassett that the room and the officer were to be undisturbed , and with a photo- graph of the dead woman in his pocket had come to me . " The point seems to be this , " he said . " If this is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mo- tive which led to the one crime has led to the other . The76 THE DOORHe hung up abruptly . It was the first time I had known that the police were watching Wallie . From the papers , ringing with another " shoe " murder , and from various sources then and later , I gained a fair idea of the unfortunate young woman . She was about thirty years of age , a quiet but not unfriendly woman . Shy . She seldom joined the others in the parlor of the Halkett Street house ; in the eveningsshe took a walk or went to the movies . She had apparently no family , and received no mail of any importance . She had been an expert stenographer in the law office of Waite and Henderson , well-known attorneys , and was highly thought of there . Recently , however , she had shown signs of nervousness , and her work had suffered somewhat . Her life had been apparently an open book . In the morning she was called at seven . She dressed slowly , ate her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She had not been interested in men , or they in her ; but she had had one caller , a gentleman , about two weeks before . His identity was unknown , but he seemed to have been a well-dressed man , not young . He had arrived , according to the colored woman servant , about eight o'clock and stayed until nine-thirty . She had had only a glimpse of him and could not describe him . On the day of her death , which was Sunday , she had spent the morning doing some small washing and mending . In the afternoon , however , she had put on the blue coat and started out . She was back in less than an hour , and had seemed low-spirited . No one had seen her leave the house that night . It was thought that she had left the house about eight , and the police believed that she had been killed at or near that ditch on the Warrenville road where the body was found . But on Monday afternoon we were to learn where she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foot of a longish hill . As a result of this , and an annoying one it is , a certain num- ber of cars come down in gear but with the switch off , and by and large a very considerable amount of back- firing takes place directly outside of my drive . The result is that when , quite recently , a bootlegger fired a number of shots at a policeman and finally wounded him in the leg , the poor wretch lay untended for some little time . All of which bears directly on the , killing of Florence Gunther . Dick had telephoned me during the day , when the iden- tity of Florence Gunther had been given out by the police , and begged me to send Judy away . " She 's not safe , " he said , worried . " Until we know what 's behind this nobody 's safe . " I agreed to do what I could , and when he came in at six o'clock , looking rather the worse for wear , he was more cheerful . I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , thinking she might hear it better from him , and she greeted him with great coolness . " Do n't come near me , " she said . " And do n't ask him to dinner , Elizabeth Jane . He walked out on me last night . " " Listen to her ! If I do n't work I do n't eat , my child . These millionaire 's daughters ! " he said to me . " They think honest toil is cutting coupons . Money 's nothing to them . " Then he remembered something , and put his hand in his pocket . " Speaking of money , " he said , " hanged if I did n't forget I 'd had a windfall . Look what I found ! " He drew out of his pocket a blue beaded bag , and Judy snatched it from him . " I suppose you 've advertised it ? " she said severely . " Darling , I am this moment out of my bath . Of course I shall , " he added virtuously . " Found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's got ten dollars in it ! " 78 THE DOOR I THE DOOR 79 " Where did you find it ? " " I just drove out from the Bell estate in my RollsRoyce , and there it was . " " On the street ? " " On the street . Right outside your gates , oh daughterof Eve . I said to myself : What 's that ? ' Then I replied : It 's a pocketbook . ' Then I shouted whoa , ' leaped from my trusty steed and It was then that Judy found the typed slip and drew it out . " You wo n't have to advertise . Here 's her name ; Florence Gunther . " " Florence Gunther ? " I said . " My God l . " It was then that Dick told her of the murder the night before . He was as careful as he could be not to horrify her , but the bare facts were dreadful enough . She went very pale , but she watched him steadily , and somehow I got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the surface , that between them there was some understanding , some secret theory against which they were checking these new facts . " On the Warrenville road ? Then she was taken there in a car ? " " Presumably , yes . " " Did anybody see the car ? " " The police are working on that . Apparently not . " " And you 've checked up on  --  things ? " " They seem all right . Absolutely O. K. " Still with this mysterious bond between them they took me out to where Dick had found the bag , and standing there he pointed out where he had found it ; not near the pavement , but almost in the center of the street . It had shown up plainly ; at first he had thought it was a bird , and veered to avoid it . Then he saw what it was . " You might figure it like this , " he said . " She 's comingagain to see you . She suspects something , and she 's got to tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bag to have been where I found it . Either she saw somebodyand ducked out into the street ; or she was in a car already , was shot while in the car , and the bag dropped out . I think she was in a car . You see there 's no blood , " he ended awkwardly . Judy looked a little sick , but she spoke practically enough . " Could n't he have shot her there , dragged her quickly into the shrubbery , and then got a car ? She must have been here at eight-thirty or so , and the body was n't found until after ten . " Well , it was possible ; but a careful search of the hedge , and the lilacs , forsythia and syringa bushes inside of it  --  some of them in leaf , for the spring had been early  --  revealed nothing whatever . I find myself dwelling on that question of time , which Judy brought up . It puzzled the police for a long time , but now we know about it ; the driving about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the decision to use the river , and the bridge crowded and no hope there ; the purchase of oil at some remote spot , leaving the car and its grisly contents at a safe distance ; and finally the Warrenvilleroad and the sleeping farmhouse . And the sick cow . The sick cow ! Everything safe , another perfect crime . And then , of all possible mischances , a sick cow . CHAPTER NINETHAT was on Monday . Tuesday morning , Jim beingstill in bed and incomunicado by the doctor 's orders , the District Attorney sent again for Amos , Jim 's servant , and terrified him into a number of damaging statements . That early dinner of Jim 's , the fact that he had left the house immediately after it , and that he had carried the sword-stick , all of these came out . And finally the frightened wretch told that the stick had disappeared . That was enough , more than enough . After that Jim was under surveillance day and night , one of those apparentlycasual affairs , but sufficient to report his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay in his bed , and if he knew the significance of the men who moved back and forward along Pine Street , or that his telephone and mail were both under espionage , he made no sign . But , although suspicion was now directed at Jim , it was only suspicion . On Tuesday night Inspector Harrison came again to see me . I was growing to like the man . He was to oppose me and all of us for a long time , but he was at least sturdily honest with me , and he was to try later on to be helpful . He was very grave that night . He sent Judy away , to her annoyance , closed the library door , and then turned to me . " I came here tonight with a purpose , Miss Bell , " he said at last . " I want you to think , and think hard . Is there anything at all , however remote  --  I do n't care how absurd  --  which would provide a motive for the killing of Sarah Gittings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That I know . Think , now ; some remote family80THE DOOR 81trouble , some secret she knew , even some scene at which she happened to be present . " " We do n't have family scenes , Inspector . " " Nonsense ! Every family has them . " " There is nothing , I assure you . Walter Somers does n't hit it off with his stepmother , but they do n't quarrel . They simply keep apart . " " And Mr. Blake ? " " Why should he quarrel with them ? They have been very good to him . I think Mrs. Somers even makes him a small allowance , and a man does n't quarrel with his bread and butter . " " Tell me something about the Somers family . I know they are wealthy . What else ? " " Howard has been married twice . His first wife eloped with another man , and died in Europe many years ago . After her death he married my cousin , Katherine . They have one child , Judy , who is here @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that 's the whole story ? " " Yes , except that Howard Somers is in bad health . He has had at least one attack of angina pectoris . He had that here last year , while I was abroad with his family . He almost died , and I suppose the end is only a question of time . " " I see . How old a man is he ? " " Almost sixty . Quite a handsome man . " " Now , about this sick spell . When you say he was sick here , do you mean in this house ? " " No . The house was closed . He was at a hotel , the Imperial . Sarah Gittings came down to take care of him . " " And Mr. Blake ? Was he here at that time ? " " He was in Maine . He has a small cottage there . " I believe now that certain of these interrogations were purely idle , designed to put me off my guard . For the next instant , in the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it found me totally unprepared for it. 82 THE DOOR " And when did you give Mr. Blake the walking stick which belonged to your grandfather ? " I must have showed my agitation , for he smiled . " Come , come , " he said . " You 're a poor witness for the defense , Miss Bell ! I see Amos has told the truth . Show a darky a police badge and he 'll come clean . How long has Mr. Blake had that cane ? " " Since some time in the early spring . In March . " " You have no idea where it is now ? " " Not the faintest . He certainly did n't bring it back here . " He bent toward me , wary and intent . " Ah , " he said . " So you know it has disappeared ! Now that 's interesting . I call that very interesting . Who told you that it had disappeared ? Not Amos . He was warned . Mr. Blake himself , perhaps ? " " No . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat back . " By and large , " he said , " we have too many detectiveson these crimes . And the family seems to be curiouslyinterested , does n't it ? For a family with nothing to conceal . Now , I would like a description of that stick , if you do n't mind . " There was nothing else to do . Much as I loathed the idea I was obliged to describe the thing , the heavy knob , the knife concealed in the shaft . " This blade now , was it sharp ? " " Absolutely not . But I daresay Jim had it sharpened . Ie would have had to , if he had meant to commit a murder . " But my sarcasm was a boomerang . " It may interest you to know that he did just that , Miss Bell . About a week after he got it . " He gave me little time to worry about that , however . " There is something else I want to verify . On the night Sarah Gittings was murdered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . At what time was that ? " THE DOOR 83 " Shortly after seven . A quarter past , possibly . " " That was a message from Miss Judy 's mother , I gather ? " " Yes , but he I checked myself , too late . He was bending forward again , watching me . " But what ? " " I have just remembered . He asked if Sarah was here ; but that is in his favor , naturally . If he had known he need not have asked . " " Or if he did know , and wished to give the impression that he did not . " He sat there looking at me , and for the first time I realized that he was potentially dangerous to me and mine . His china blue eyes were cold and searching ; under his bald head his face was determined , almost belligerent . And he was intelligent , shrewd and intelligent . Later on I was to try to circumvent him ; to pit my own wits against his . Always he thwarted me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , almost to the very end , he remained as mysterious as Sarah , as aloof as FlorenceGunther , as implacable as fate itself . Yet he treated me always with friendliness and oftenwith deference , and now his voice was almost casual . " Did he say where he was when he called up ? " " No . At home , probably . " " Do n't you know better than that , Miss Bell ? " he inquiredpointedly . " If you do n't let me tell you . On that night Jim Blake dined early , and left the house at seven , or a few minutes after . He did no telephoning before he left . We have a list of his calls out for that night . Wherever he was when he telephoned  --  and we are trying to locate that  --  he was not at home . " And I felt again that this communicativeness of his was deliberate , that he was watching for its effect on me . " But why ? Why would Jim Blake kill Sarah ? " I demanded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was getting ready to go , and he stopped by the door , 84 THE DOOR THE DOOR 85 " Now and then , in criminal work , " he said , " we find the criminal before we learn the motive . I make no accusationagainst Mr. Blake . I merely say that his movementsthat night require explanation , and that until he makes that explanation we have to use our own interpretation . If that 's unfavorable to him that 's his fault . " One comfort at least we had at that time . The reporters , the camera men and the crowds of inquisitive sightseers had abandoned us , and out on the Warrenville Road Hawkins had thriftily piled brush about the site of the crime , and was letting in the morbid minded at a price until the county police stopped him . The cow had died . But in my own household demoralization was almost complete . The women were in a state of hysteria , afraid to leave the house and almost as terrified to stay in it . On Tuesday morning the laundress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the chair had been taken from the laundry again and was once more in the room where the wood was stored . And on that night , at somethingafter twelve o'clock , Clara ran down to my room , pounding on the door and shouting that there was a man under her bed . It required Joseph with the revolver and myself with all my courage to discover Jock there , neatly curled up and asleep . The matter of the chair , however , puzzled me . I took Judy and went down . It was a plain wooden chair , and it had been left where it was found . Judy mounted it and examined the joists above , for this portion of the basement is not celled . But there was nothing there except a large black spider , at which she got down in a hurry . I do n't know what I had expected to find . The swordstick , perhaps . It was on Wednesday that I determined to see Jim . I had not seen him for over a week , not indeed sincethe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state had bewildered me Jim 's frankly shocked me . I had been fond of Jim , but with no particular approval . The very fact that he was still idling through his late forties ; that he was content to live modestly because extravagance meant work ; that he could still put in weeks of preparation on the Bachelors ' Ball , given each year for the debutantes ; that his food and drink were important to him , and his clothes  --  all these things had annoyed me . Nor had I ever quite believed in his feeble health ; certainlyhe was a stronger man than Howard , who had always worked and who was still working in the very shadow of death . Certainly Jim was able to play golf , to sit up all night at bridge , to eat and drink what he wanted , and to dance with a young generation which liked his cocktails and the flowers he sent them . But this was the surface of Jim Blake . Of the real man , buried under that slightly bulging waistline , that air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even Katherine knew anything . He went his way , apparently a cheerful idler , with his present assured , and his future undoubtedly cared for in the case of Howard 's death . There was , however , nothing cheerful about the Jim I found on Wednesday night , lying in his handsome bed and nursed and valeted by Amos . I have often wonderedsince just what were his thoughts as he lay there day after day , watching Amos moving deftly about the room ; Amos who knew so much and yet not enough . The two watching each other , the black man and the white , and yet all serene between them on the surface . " I 've ordered sweetbreads for luncheon , sir . " " That 's right . Put them on a little ham , Amos . " And Amos going out , efficient and potentially dangerous , to order sweetbreads . Jim must have had his bad hours , his own temptations . He could have escaped even then ; could have slipped86 THE DOORout the rear door to his car and gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acute . But he did not . He lay there in his bed and waited for the inevitable . He was glad to see me , I thought . He was propped up in bed in a pair of mauve silk pyjamas , and with a dressing gown of dark brocade hanging over a chair beside him . The room was masculine enough , but a trifle too carefully done , as though Jim had taken pains to place the jewel which was himself in a perfect setting . There was something incongruous in the contrast betweenthat soft interior , shaded and carefully lighted , with Jim as the central figure , the star of its stage , and the man I had seen across the street as I walked to the house . I had walked . I felt that it was not necessary to take my household into my confidence on this particularmatter . " Well , " he said , " this is a kindly and Christian act ! Sit down . That 's a good chair . " He was nervous . I saw for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which was never afterwardsto leave him , and as I told him my story it grew more and more marked . Yet save for that twitching he heard me through quietly enough . " What do you want me to say ? " he said . " Or to do ? If the police want a scapegoat  --  innocent men have been arrested before this for the sake of the sensational press  --  what am I to do about it ? Run away ? " " You can tell them the truth . " " What truth ? " he said irritably . " Tell them where you were the night Sarah was killed . Surely you can do that , Jim . " " I have already told them . I live the usual life of a bachelor . I 'm neither better nor worse than others . I decline to drag a woman into this ; any woman . They can all go to hell first . " I felt my heart sink . His indignation was not real . He spoke like a man who has rehearsed a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watching me , intently , furtively . For the first time I realized how badly frightenedhe was . " I see , " I said , quietly . " And I daresay that 's where you left the cane . Naturally you would not care to speak about it . " " The cane ? What cane ? " " The one I gave you , Jim . It 's missing , apparently . " He said nothing for a full minute . It must have been a terrible shock to him . Perhaps he was going back , in his mind ; who knew about the cane ? Amos , of course . And Amos had been talking . His distrust and anger at Amos must have been a devastating thing just then . But he rallied himself . " What 's that got to do with it ? Anybody can lose a stick . I 've lost dozens , hundreds . " " You carried it out with you that night , you know . " " And I suppose that proves that I killed Sarah Gittings ! And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other night , put a can of kerosene in my car and shot this FlorenceGunther ! . There 's no case there . I carry a stick out one night and forget it somewhere . Well , they ca n't hang me for that . And I was n't out of this house lastSunday night . " hWhat could I say ? Tell him Waffle 's story , that the sword-cane had not disappeared until Sarah 's body wasfound ? That he had brought it back , and that the police Iljknew he had brought it back ? He hated Wallie , and I Ih was in no condition to face an outburst of anger from him , especially since I felt that that too might have beenprepared in advance ; the careful defense of a frightened IP man . One thing I was certain of when I left . He was a frightened man , but not a sick man . The loose sleeve of his pyjama coat revealed a muscular and well-nourishedarm , and when Amos came in reply to the summonshe carried a night tray with a substantial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scowled when he saw it . " You can leave that , and I want you to drive Miss Bell home , Amos . She walked over . " " Yes , sir . " I had a flash then of the strange relationship between the two of them , shut in there together ; of suspicion and anger on Jim 's part , and on the negro 's of fear and somethingelse . Not hostility . Uneasiness , perhaps . " Can I shake up your pillows , sir ? " " No . Do n't bother . " I felt baffled as I went clown the stairs . I daresay it is always difficult to face civilized human beings and to try to realize that they have joined the lost brotherhood of those who have willfully taken human lives . There appears to be no gulf ; they breathe , eat , talk , even on occasion laugh . There is no mark on their foreheads . L'ut the gulf is there , never to be bridged ; less broad perhaps for those who have killed in passion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , plotted , schemed , that a living being shall cease to live . All hope that Jim Blake would clear himself , at least in my eyes , was gone . And at the foot of the stairs Amos was waiting , enigmatic , the perfect servant , to help me into my wrap . " I 'll bring the car around at once , ma'am . " " I 'll go back with you , Amos . It will save time . " " The yard 's pretty dark , Miss Bell . " " Have n't you a flashlight ? " He produced one at once from a drawer of the hall table , and I followed him , through his neat pantry and kitchen and out into the yard . Here in mild weather Jim sometimes served coffee after dinner , and he had planted it rather prettily . I remember the scent of the spring night as I followed Amos , and seeing the faint outlines of Jim 's garden furniture , a bench , a few chairs , a table . " I see you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yes 'm . I painted them a few days ago . We 'll be having warm weather soon . " THE DOOR 89I took the light while he unlocked the small door and backed the car into the alley beyond . It occurred to me that the watcher out front would hear the noise and come to investigate , but the alley was lined with garages . One car more or less would make little difference . I have wondered about that surveillance since . Clearly it would always have been possible for Jim to come and go by the alley way if he so desired . Probably the intention was not that , but rather to see what visitors he received , and for all I know there may have been some arrangement with Amos , to warn the watcher if Jim left his bed and dressed for any purpose . However that may be , we were not molested , and I still carried the flashlight when I got into the rear of the car . I knew the car well . I had sold it to Jim a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one . It was a dark blue limousine , the driving seat covered with leather , the interior upholstered in a pale gray . " Car doing all right , Amos ? " " Very well , ma'am . " Idly I switched on the flashlight and surveyed the interior . Undoubtedly the car had begun to show wear . There were scars on the seat cushions from cigarette burns , and one or two on the carpet . I think now that these movements of mine were a sort of automatism , or perhaps the instinct of the uneasy mind to seek refuge in the trivial . The car was of no importance to me . Let them burn it , these people who shared the " usual life of a bachelor , " these men for whom Amos painted the garden furniture , these women who must be protected , not dragged in . And then I saw something . There was a ring-shaped stain on the carpet near my feet , well defined , dark . It was perhaps seven inches across , and I lowered the flashlight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woman-fashion I ran my finger over it and then sniffed the finger . It was oil . It was keroseneoil. 90 THE DOORI put out the flashlight and sat back . There were a dozen possible explanations for that stain , but only one occurred to me . Sitting there in the dark , I pondered the matter of eliminating it before Amos found it . Or had he already found it ? Was he sitting there beyond the glass partition , driving as perfectly as he did everything else , and all the time aware of my movements , knowing what I had found ? Did the police know , too ? Suppose I were to say to Amos : " Amos , this carpet is dirty . I 'm taking it to have it cleaned , while Mr. Blake is not using the car . " Perhaps that in itself would rouse his suspicion . He might say : " Do n't bother , Miss Bell . I 'll see to it . " And then Amos and I would be bickering over the carpet ; it would grow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take it to the police . I did the best thing I could think of at the moment . I stooped down and loosened the carpet , rolled it up carefully , and then hid it as best I could underneath my long cape . I f I looked strange to Joseph when he admitted me , he said nothing . Once Judy had said that Joseph had no capacity for astonishment , and the thought supported me that night as , certainly nervous and probably bulging , I entered my own house . Judy called to me from the library , but I passed the door with as much expedition as I dared . She and Dick were settled there over a card table , with a sheet of paper before them . I saw that , and that Dick was apparently making a sketch of some sort . As I went up the stairs he was saying : " Now get this . Here 's the daybed . The closet door is there " Then I was in my room , the door bolted , and that incriminatingcarpet on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question about it . A jug or can containing keroseneoil had rested on it , probably quite recently . CHAPTER TENALONE woman who has lived in a house for many years grows to know her house . It is like a live thing to her ; it has its moods , its contrary days , and it has its little eccentricities . This stair creaks , that windowrattles , that door sticks . Especially , if she is not a good sleeper , she grows to know her house at night . All houses are strange at night . It is as though , after the darkness and silence have fallen , they stir and waken to some mysterious life of their own . In my house , some of these movements I can account for , When the windows are raised the old beams creak , as though the house is cracking its knuckles , and when we have a north wind the skylight wails and whines . A metal weatherstrip that is , vibrating like a string . Then , too , a breeze from the west will set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which have roused me more than once , convinced that I was called ; and an open window in the drawing room beside the speaking tube there will send on windy days a fine thin whistle through the house . But I do not like my cellar . Perhaps this is a throwbackto my childhood ; I do not know . The fact remains that I go into it at night under protest , and that I have had installed in the back hall a switch by which a light below is turned on before any one need descend . A bit of precaution for which I could have shrieked with . rage before that night had passed . It was eleven o'clock when I returned , and soon afterwards I heard Dick leave the house . His paper is an afternoonone , and so he has to rise fairly early . Judy wandered in to say good-night , but I had locked the carpetin my closet , and she merely lighted a cigarette and . stood inside the door. 9192 THE DOOR I THE DOOR 93 " When is Mary going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why ? " " She 's been packing tonight . Dick helped Joseph to bring her trunk down from the storeroom . She does n't seem too keen to go . " " It 's her own choice , " I said , rather acidly . " Well , I hope to heaven mother does n't wish her on us ! She may . To shut her mouth about Uncle Jim . " But she did not go away at once . She stood there , smoking fast and apparently thinking . " Do n't you think Wallie 's been rather queer over all this ? " she said . " So if anything happens to me you 'll understand , ' " she mimicked him . " If he knows anythingnow is the time to tell it . And if he does n't , why do n't he keep out ? Where does he come in , anyhow ? What 's he worried about ? " " I do wish you 'd keep out of all this , Judy . " " Why ? It 's the day of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It 's the hour for the young to be in bed . " " All right , I 'm going now . But just to show you why I 'm not going back to New York , in spite of you and Dick  --  Wallie did n't find that pencil on top of the skylight . He took it up with him and put it there . " With which she went away , whistling softly , and left me to my thoughts , which were nothing to boast about . I did not go to bed . I sat shut in my bedroom , with the carpet from the car rolled in my closet , waiting for the house to quiet down for the night . My mind was a welter of confusion ; Jim 's evasions and half truths , the possible significance of the oil stain , and Judy 's strange statement as to Wallie and the pencil . And to add to my discomfort Joseph tapped at my door after letting Dick out and locking up , and told me that the women in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ walking , " and were scaring themselves into a fit over it . I am not a superstitious woman , but there is something of the mystic in every Christian , and Imust confess that when , at something after one , the speaking tube in my room set up a thin whistle , my hair seemed to stand on end . Ever since the night of Sarah 's death Joseph had been instructed to leave a light burning in the lower hall , and it was burning then . I opened my door carefully and slipping out , leaned over the banister . Save that Jock had apparently been asleep there , and had now risen and was stretching himself drowsily , there was no sign of anything unusual . If there was a window or a door open in the drawing room I felt that it could stay open for a while . I had other business to attend to first . Jock 's attitude had given me confidence , and at somethingafter one , wearing a dressing gown and my feltsoledbedroom slippers , I took the rug and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the basementlaundry , stopping in the kitchen to pick up the poker from the range . I was minded to have a weapon of some sort at hand . I had a plan , of sorts . If the stain came out I could return the rug to Amos , and he could think what he might ; lay my high-handed proceeding to the eccentricitiesof a middle-aged female if it pleased him . If it did not come out , I could burn the thing in the furnace . But I was very nervous , and the basement itself daunted me ; the long vistas of blackness forward , to the furnace and the coal and wood cellars , the darkness of the laundry and the drying room . The small light at the foot of the stairs , which turned on from the back hall above , made little impression on the gloom , and as I stood there it seemed to me that something crawled over the wood in the wood cellar . A rat , possibly , but it did not help my morale . The laundry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room , and turn on the hanging globe in the center . I went in , shivering , and directly in the center of the room I struck violently against something . It was a94 THE DOOR THE DOOR 95chair , and it upset with a clatter that echoed and reechoedin that cavernous place . What was the chair doing there ? It belonged under a window , and here it was , out of place again . What was it that moved that chair ? And Joseph 's somber statementcame back to me , to complete my demoralization . After all , chairs did move . They moved in seances . Chairs and tables , without being touched . I was badly frightened , I confess . A dozen stories of phantasms , discredited at the time , rose in my mind . The place seemed peopled with moving shadows , sinisterand threatening , and from somewhere I seemed to hear footsteps , spectral , felt rather than heard . And when I finally found courage to try the laundry light , it had burned out . Such efforts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of no practical value , and I decided once for all to burn the rug and take the consequences . I did one of the hardest things I have ever done in my life when I went forward to the furnace cellar , carrying the rug . Once the light there was on , however , I felt better . I built a small fire of paper and kindling , and thrust in the rug . It began to blaze , although not as rapidly as I had hoped . I stood there , watching and wondering about the dampers ; like most women , I know nothing about a furnace . I wandered about , waiting for that slow combustion to become effectual , examined the windows and the door to the area way , and was retracing my steps forward to the furnace again , when I stopped suddenly . Some one was moving about over my head . I pulled myself together . The dogs had not barked . It must be Joseph , Joseph who had heard the whining in the speaking tubes and come down to investigate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have been disastrous . I turned out the furnace light at once , and went back toward the foot of the stairs , where thesmall light still burned . To my horror , I saw that light go out , and heard the bolt slipped in the door above . " Joseph ! " I called . " Joseph ! " It was not Joseph . The footsteps had ceased , but there was no answering call . Somebody , something , was lurking there overhead , listening . The thought was horriblebeyond words . I was crouched on the foot of the staircase , and there I remained in that haunted darkness until daylight . At dawn I crept up the stairs , and half sat , half lay , on the narrow landing . Perhaps I slept , perhaps I fainted . I shall never forget Joseph 's face when , at seven o'clock , he unlocked the door and found me there . " Good heavens , madam ! " he said . " Help me up , Joseph . I ca n't move . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . You locked me in , Joseph . I 've had a terrible night . You  --  or somebody . " " I locked you in , madam ? At what time ? " " About two o'clock , I think . " " I was not downstairs after midnight , " he said , and helped me to my feet . He got me into the pantry and made me some coffee . Norah was not yet down ; my household slept badly those days , and therefore late . He had had a shock , however . His hands shook and his face was set . I can still see him moving about , his dignity less majestic than usual , making the coffee , laying a doily on the pantry table , fetching a cup and saucer from the dining room . While he waited for the coffee to boil he made a tour of the first floor , but reported everything in order . The drawing room door and windows were locked . " But I would suggest , madam , " he said , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Since Miss Sarah 's key is missing it is hardly safe . " Norah came in as I finished my coffee , and she gave me a queer look . But I did not explain . I went u THE DOORand crawled into my bed , and I did not waken until Joseph came up with a tray of luncheon . He came in , closed the door , drew a table beside the bed , opened my napkin and gave it to me . Then he straightened and looked at me . " I have taken the liberty of destroying the rug , madam . " My heart sank , but he spoke as calmly as though he had been reporting that the butter was bad . " The dampers were wrong , " he said . " It 's a peculiar furnace . You have to understand it . " He looked at me , and I looked back at him . Our relationshad subtly changed , although his manner had not . We shared a secret ; in effect , Joseph and I were accomplices . Between us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it . Whether he had seen the stain or not , he knew that carpet . " You should not have tried to do that , madam , " he said . " In the future , if you need any help , you can alwayscall on me . " Then he went out ; strange inscrutable Joseph , living the vicarious life of all upper class servants . Somewhere he had a wife , but he never mentioned her . His room at night , the pantry and the newspapers by day , apparentlycomprised his life and satisfied him . It was when he came to remove the tray that he told me , very quietly , that his revolver was missing . " I have been keeping it in my bedroom lately , under my pillow , " he said . " Now it is gone . Taken by some one who knew the habits of the house , madam . " CHAPTER ELEVENWHATEVER was the meaning of that unpleasanf episode , it was impossible to go to the police with it . I was seeing rather less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ squad were working on the Gunthercase ; the crime detection unit of photographer , chemist , microscopist and gun expert were at work , but I believetheir conclusions were unimportant . The bullet was missing . From the size of the wounds in the skull and the fact that it had passed entirely through the head , they believed that it had been a large caliber bullet fired at close range , and that the time of her death had been about eight or eight-thirty . The bag , then , had lain in the street for almost three hours . Outside of these facts the murder remained a complete and utter mystery . She appeared to have been withoutfriends or family , one of these curious beings who from all appearances have sprung sporadically into being , without any past whatever . She had had , no ability for friendship , unless that odd acquaintance of hers with Sarah could be called friendship . Strange that two such reserved women should have found each other , have somehow broken down their repressions , have walked , talked , maybe even laughed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or so before the murders , they had met a number of times . One pictures them walking together , maybe sitting together in a moving picture theater , and then one day something said ; a bit of confidence , and both were doomed . The day passed without incident , save that Mary Martintook her departure . She even cried a little when she left , although she had shown no affection for any of us. 9798 THE DOOR THE DOOR 99Judy seemed relieved to have her gone . " Thank heaven , " she said . " I do n't have to whisper any more . She was always listening , Elizabeth Jane . I 've caught her at it , leaning over the banisters . I 'll bet my hat she knows something . And I 'll bet two dollars , which is all I have in the world at the moment , that she took Joseph 's gun . " " Why would she take Joseph 's gun ? That 's silly . " " Is it ? Well , ask Norah . She knows . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It appeared that on the day before Joseph had missed his revolver , Norah had gone upstairs to her room to change her uniform before she prepared luncheon . She wears rubber-soled shoes in the kitchen , as it has a tiled floor , and so she moved quietly . Joseph , it seems , was downstairs . The door at the top of the back stairs is a swinging one , as otherwise the maids forget to close it , and it swings noiselessly . She pushed it open , and there was Mary Martin , down the hall and just corning out of Joseph 's room . She stepped back when she saw Norah , and then reconsidered and came out again . " I was looking for some matches , " she said . According to Norah she had no matches in her hands , however , and she looked so pale that Norah was curious . When Mary had shut herself in her room Norah glanced inside Joseph 's door . There were matches on his bureau , and his revolver lay on top of the bed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ again and with no " snooping , " as Judy called it , I went into the library that night to find Dick grinning and Judy with her mouth set hard . " Well , tell her , if you think it 's so funny . " " Tell her yourself , lady of my heart . Do your own dirty work . " " Do n't be such an ass . It 's a perfectly simple thing I want , Elizabeth Jane . I want to get into Florence Gunther 's room . " " The answer is just as simple , Judy , " I said shortly . " You 'll do nothing of the sort . " But she was argumentative and a trifle sulky . " Oh well , if you must have it . I want to look for something . That 's all . " " For what ? " " I do n't know . But now listen to this ; I do n't know why poor Sarah was killed , or Florence either . But I do know why their shoes were taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; I do n't know what , but she had . It might have been a paper " " Give me the papers and take the child ! " said Dick . She ignored that . " Now Dick has struck up an acquaintance with a blonde out there at the house on Halkett Street . She 's named Lily , and he 's quite fond of her ; he 's even had her out to lunch . " Dick groaned , and she grinned maliciously . " Her name is Sanderson , Lily Sanderson , and she 's rather a mess . But she likes to talk , and she 's got something she has n't told the police . She wo n't even tell him , but she might tell us . " " Who are us ' ? " " You and I , Elizabeth Jane ; you to give staidness and respectability to the excursion , I to use my little wiles to wheedle her if necessary . Dick says she 's afraid of the police , but once she sets eyes on you she 'll open up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she has her own methods , has Judy , and so in the end I reluctantly consented to go . The appointment was made for the next night , Friday . Evidently Miss Sanderson was uneasy , for she made it Friday because the colored woman would be off for her afternoon out . And it was she herself who admitted us when , having left the car at the corner , Judy and I presentedourselves on the following evening . She opened the door with her finger to her lips . " Now how nice ! " she said , in a loud clear tone . " Here100 THE DOOR THE DOOR 101I was , afraid I was to have an evening alone , and this happens ! " All the time she was urging us in with little gestures , and Judy 's face was a study . Miss Sanderson was a large blonde woman with a slight limp , and she was evidently prepared for company . She was slightly overdressed , and her room when she took us up to it was very tidy . Suspiciously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just finished with it . When she had closed the door she lowered her voice . " You never know who 's around in a place like this . It 's all ears . And since poor Miss Gunther 's awful end " She looked at me with her pale blue eyes , and they were childish and filled with terror . " I have n't slept much since . If there is a homicidal maniac loose , nobody can tell who 'll be next . " " I would n't worry , " said Judy . " There 's no maniac loose . Whoever killed her knew what he was doing . " That seemed to relieve her . She was , for all her clothes , a singularly simple woman , and I am glad here to pay my bit of tribute to Lily Sanderson . She had her own small part in the solving of the mystery , and of the four major crimes which it involved . She liked Judy at once , I think . There is something direct about Judy , for all her talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , felt the compassion of youth for her , for the narrow life that one room typified , for the loneliness of soul which was feeding on this one great excitement . I saw her looking about at the dreadful reach at beauty which the room revealed , the tea table at which nobody obviously ever had tea , at the silk shawl draped over the bed , at the imitation shell toilet set , the gaudily painted scrap basket , and at the screen which concealed the washstand in its corner , and behind which , I had no doubt , Miss Sanderson had dumped a clutter of odds and ends . " You are very comfortable here , are n't you ? It 's quite homelike . " Miss Sanderson smiled her childlike smile . " It 's all the home I have , " she said . " And Mrs. Bassettlikes everything to be nice . She 's very clean , really . " Before she settled to her story she opened her door , looked out , closed it again . " I 'm only talking because you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I do n't know if what I have to tell you is important , or not . I wo n't have to go to the police , will I ? " " Certainly not , " said Judy sturdily . " You know I told them that I 'd heard her moving things about , that night ? Well , I did . I did n't like to say what I really thought . " She lowered her voice . " I thought she had a man up there . That 's what I went up in the morning to speak to her about . " " A man ? " I asked . " Could you hear him ? " " A man and a woman , " she said . " I could hear them both . " Her story amounted to this : She was a light sleeper , and she was wakened some time after midnight by movements in the room above . As Florence never stirred about in the night , this puzzled her . Especially as the movements continued . " Somebody seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Very carefully , but you ca n't move a bureau in a house built like this without it making some noise . Even then I might have gone to sleep again , but there were two people . One walked heavier than the other . " She was curious , rather than alarmed . She got up and opened her door , and at last she crept up the stairs and  --  she seemed to apologize for this  --  put her ear to the door . There was a man talking in a low tone in the room . That scandalized her . She went downstairs " with her head whirling , " and stood there , uncertain what to do . She seems to have been in a state of shock and indignation , imagining all sorts of things . And the sounds went on , only now she could hear a woman crying . She was102 THE DOOR THE DOOR 103outraged . She thought Florence Gunther had a man in her room and that they were quarreling . Finally she took her haircurler and rapped vigorously on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she set her door open and waited inside in the dark , nobody came down . Whoever they were , they must have escaped down the rear staircase . But she could not sleep . A sort of virtuous fury possessedher , and half an hour later she threw something on and went up valiantly to Florence 's room . " I was going to give her a good talking to , " she said . " It makes me sick now to think of it , but this is a respectablehouse , and  --  well , you know what I mean . If she was carrying on with anybody The door was closed but not locked , and she spoke to Florence and got no answer . She turned on the switch inside the door , and there was the room ; in chaos . She seemed unable to describe it . She made a gesture . " Even her shoes , " she said . " Her poor shoes were on the floor . But she had n't been robbed . Her dime bank was still on her dresser @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the daybed on a table . It was still there . " She shot downstairs after that , trembling , and got into bed . Even then she was not certain that Florence was not concerned in it somehow . She knew that one of the two in that room had been a woman . Then too she " did n't want to be mixed up in any trouble . " She might lose her position , and in addition she had a childish fear of the police . " If they knew I 'd been up there " She went asleep finally , but at seven she went up the stairs again and opened the door . The room had been straightened . It looked better . " Not just right , you know . But things were put away . The way the police found it . " " And what do you think now ? " Judy inquired . She had lighted a cigarette and was offering one to " Lily . " " Oh , may I ? I 'd love to . We are n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I open a window and It rests one , I think . " " Yes , it does rest one , " said Judy politely . " And now what were those people after ? Have you any idea ? " " Not really . But she was in a lawyer 's office , and they get some queer things sometimes . Letters , you know , and so on . If she had something like that it might explaina lot . It had to be something small , or they 'd have found it . But I 'm sure I do n't know where it is , if it 's there . " " Oh , you 've looked ? " said Judy . " Yes . The room 's kept locked , but my key fits it . I suppose it 's hardly the correct thing , but she was a friend of mine Her eyes filled with tears , and Judy patted her heavy shoulder . " Of course it was the correct thing . Perfectly correct . As a matter of fact I 'd like to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , do you ? " Miss Sanderson not only did not mind , but looked rather gratified . " I 'll wait down here with the curler , " she said with a conspiratorial air , " and if I hear anything I 'll rap on the chandelier . " I was all for waiting below , but Judy took me with her , maintaining that the very sight of me would remove her from the sneak thief class if we were discovered , and at last I consented . Nevertheless , I was frankly tremblingwhen we started up the stairs . Miss Sanderson had preceded us , creeping up with a stealth which gave the entire procedure a clandestine appearance which was disquieting , to say the least . After unlocking the door , however , she left us as noiselessly as we had come , and Judy moved the key from the outside to the inside of the door . As we stood there in the darkness I think even Judy was uneasy , and I know that I felt like a criminal . The house was exceedingly quiet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slept at the rear of that floor , but she was ill , had been for some time . And whatever was the mysterious life of the women behind the closed doors around us , it was conducted in silence . Judy drew the shades before she turned on the light , and then the two of us gazed at this strange room , from which Florence Gunther had started out in a checked frock and a blue coat and with a blue bag on her arm , to a sudden and unaccountable death . It was neat now , very orderly , the daybed covered with the imitation Indian rug , her clothing still in its closet , her shoes in a row underneath . Practical shoes , flat heeled , without coquetry , each with its wooden tree . Judy looked depressed and angry . " She had so little , " she said . " Why not have let her alone ? " But she was businesslike , too . " No use looking in the obvious places , " she announced . " They 'll have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ police took it for granted that they got it , whatever it was . But if Lily is right ! If I wanted to hide a paper here , where would I put it ? I hid a love letter once from mother , in my can of tooth powder . " Poor Florence 's tooth powder was on her washstand , but although with much difficulty and a pair of scissors Judy finally worked the top off , she found nothing there . Then she examined the bottles on the dresser ; one dark blue one interested her , but it contained an eye lotion and nothing else . The wall paper  --  " she might have loosened the paper and then glued it back again "  --  showed no signs of being tampered with , and the baseboard was close to the wall . She reached the clothes closet , then , by elimination , and with small hope . " They 'll have done that first , " she said . Apparently she was right . No pocket , no lining , no hem of any garment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , which at first looked as though our search was THE DOOR 105useless . There was an old pocketbook in the closet , and she brought it out and examined it . " Look here ! " she said . " She 's carried something in this pocketbook , hidden . See where she 's cut the lining and sewed it up again ? " " It 's not sewed now . " " No , " she said slowly . " Of course , if she transferred it to the blue bag ! " But time was passing , and I was growing impatient . The whole excursion seemed to me to be an impertinent meddling , and so I was about to say to Judy , when there came a sharp rap from the chandelier beneath our feet . Neither one of us moved , and I know I hardly breathed . Some one was coming up the stairs , moving very quietly . The steps halted just outside the door , and I motioned wildly to Judy to turn out the light . But in a moment they moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I breathed again . After that we locked the door , and Judy matter-offactlywent on with her search . She was on the floor now , carefully inspecting Florence 's shoes . " I used to hide my cigarettes in my slippers , " she stated . " Mother raised hell about my smoking . I 'll just look these over and then we 'll go . " " And the sooner the better , " I retorted testily . " If you think I 'm enjoying this , I 'm not . I 've never spent a night I enjoyed less . " But she was paying no attention . She had found , in a pair of flat black shoes , leather insoles designed to supportthe arches . Glanced at casually each was a part of the shoe , but Judy 's sensitive well-manicured fingers were digging at one of them diligently . " Flat feet , poor dear , " she said , and jerked out the insole . It was , I believe , a quite common affair of its sort , although I had never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , into which fitted a small pad of wool , designed to raise the forward arch. 106 THE DOORBehind this Judy dug out a small scrap of paper , neatly folded . I think we were both trembling when she drew it out and held it up . But without opening it she dropped it inside the neck of her frock and finding a pin , fastened it there . She wears so little underneath that this precautionwas necessary . " No time now to be curious , Elizabeth Jane , " she said . " We have to get out of here , and to stall off Lily . " Everything was still quiet as we relocked the door and went down . Miss Sanderson was peering out of her door and beckoned us in , but Judy shook her head . " They made a pretty clean sweep , " she said , " but thank you anyhow . You 've been very sweet to us . " " He did n't try to get in , did he ? " " Somebody stopped outside the door and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I could n't see . It was a man though . It might have been the doctor , " she added doubtfully . " I just thought I 'd better warn you . Wo n't you come in again ? " She was clearly disappointed when we refused . She must have had many lonely evenings , poor soul , and to entertain Judy would have been a real thrill ; Judy Somers , whose pictures were often in the New York evening papers and in the smarter magazines . " I 've got some sandwiches , " she said . " Thanks , no . I never eat at night . " She saw us out , rather forlornly . " If anything turns up , I 'll let you know . " " Please do . You 've been wonderful . " She brightened at that , and the last we saw of her she was peering around the half-closed front door , loath to go back to her untasted sandwiches , to her loneliness and her wakeful nights . We found the car around the corner where we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my bedroom with the door locked did Judy produce that scrap of paper . And then it turned out to be completely unintelligible . Neatly typed , THE DOOR 107on thin copy paper was this : " Clock dial . Five o'clock right . Seven o'clock left . Press on six . " " Clock dial ! " said Judy . " What clock ? There 's something in a clock somewhere , but that 's as far as I go . It was n't her clock . She did n't have one . As far as I can make out , we 're exactly where we started ! " Which turned out to be very nearly a precise statement of the situation . THE DOOR 109T UST when Amos discovered that his carpet was missinging from the car I do not know . With Jim in bed the car was not in use , and it may have been a couple of days before he missed it , or even more . I hardly think he suspectedme , although he may have . But some time before Sunday he saw Wallie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him I do not know . Certainly he believed Jim Blake to be the guiltiest wretch unhung , but we also . know that he had a queer affection for him . Maybe Wallie questioned him ; Wallie had his own problem to solve , and he may have gone to Amos . The result , however , was an extremely unpleasant interviewbetween Wallie and myself a day or two after Judy had found the paper . I know now that he was frightened , terrified beyond any power of mine fo imagine , and with Wallie as with other nervous persons anxiety took the form of anger . He stalked into the house then late on Sunday afternoon , looking so strange that at first I thought he had been drinking again . " Do you mind if I close the door ? " he demanded . I 've got some things to say that you may not want overheard . " " Then I 'd better leave it open . I do n't care for any more secrets , or any scenes . " " Very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trying to protect . " But he slammed the door shut , nevertheless , and then confronted me . " I 've got to know something . Of all the damnable , outrageous messes ! Did you or did you not take the rug out of Jim Blake 's car the other night ? " " Why ? Is it missing ? " " You know damned well it 's missing . " 108CHAPTER TWELVE " I do n't like your tone , Wallie . " He pulled himself together then , and took another turn about the room . " Sorry , " he muttered . " I get excited . God , who would n't be excited ? I 'll ask you in a different way . Was the carpet in the car the other night when Amos drove you back here ? " " It was . " " And you left it there ? " " Why should n't I ? " " That 's not an answer . " " Now see here , Wallie , " I said . " I wo n't be bullied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ questions you put to me . Go to the police , if you like . Then if they choose to come to me " The police . I 'm trying my very best to keep the police out of this . But that darky of Jim Blake 's blabs everythinghe knows . They 'll get it out of him yet . All I want to find out is why the carpet was taken . What was on it ? It told something . What did it tell ? " I eyed him . " Wallie , " I said , " do you believe that Jim Blake committedthese crimes ? You 've insinuated that , and that there was a reason . " " I could think of a reason , but this Gunther thing  --  No , I do n't believe he 's got the guts . " " If you could think of a reason , it 's your business to tell it . Tell me , at least . If I 'm to work in the dark " Ah , so you have been working ! Now look @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Blood ? You took it , did n't you ? Amos says you did . " " Why should he say that ? " " He says that if you got in the car and it was missing , you 'd have asked about it . " I made up my mind then to make a clean breast of it . " I did take it , Wallie . I took it out and burned it in the furnace . There was oil on it ; a ring of oil . Somethingcontaining kerosene oil had been carried in it . " 110 THE DOOR THE DOOR 111 " My God ! " he said , and seemed to sag lower in his chair . He had aged in the past few days . That is the only way I can describe the change in him . That buoyancy and gaiety which had made him likable , with all his faults , had deserted him . But I could not feel sorry for him . He knew something ; I rather thought that he knew a great deal . " Do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he asked . " I have n't an idea . If he did , the police may know it too ; but I think , if they do know it , they would have taken it away for safekeeping . No , I think you and I , and Joseph , are the only ones so far . " " Joseph ? What 's Joseph got to do with it ? " He listened intently while I told him of my attempt to burn the carpet , and of my being locked in the cellar . I could not gather from his face what he made of the incident . IIe had had time to recover , and the fact that the carpet had been actually destroyed seemed to reassure him . But when I finished he remained sunk in a silence which was more like brooding than anything else . I finally broke in on this . " Is n't it time you told what you know , Wallie ? If this thing is to go on , none of us are safe . Even Judy . " " Judy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And I do n't know anything . " " That 's not entirely true , is it ? " " You 'll know all I know , when the time comes . " He got up , looked at me furtively , and then began to finger the pens and pencils on my desk . " I suppose , " he said , with an attempt at casualness , " that you are one of the incorruptibles , eh ? A lie 's a lie , and all that ? " " I will assuredly not perjure myself , if that 's what you mean . " " Why put a label on everything ? What 's perjury anyhow ? What 's the difference except the label betweenyour pretending you have a headache and making a statement that might save a life ? " " Perjury is a lie before God . " " Every lie is a lie before God , if you believe in God . All I want you to do is to say , if it becomes necessary to say anything , that that carpet was not in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , as I started to speak , " your own position is n't any too comfortable , is it ? You 've destroyed valuable evidence . And what do you do to Jim Blake if you tell the truth ? I tell you , there 's more behind this than you know . There are worse sins than lies , if you insist on talking about lies . I give you my word , if you tell about that carpet , Harrisonwill arrest Jim . Arrest him immediately . " " I 'm not going to volunteer anything , Wallie . " " You 've got to do more than that . You 've got to stick it out . There are always thieves about , and what 's to have hindered some one crawling over Jim 's fence and getting in , by the garage window ? The car had n't been out , according to Amos , from the day Jim took sick ; or went to bed , rather . He 's not sick . That carpet might have been gone for a , week @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than ever when he had gone . Judy and Dick were out ; on the hillside of the Larimer lot , I suspected , and after Waffle 's departureI sat down at my desk and made an outline of the possible case against Jim Blake . I still have it , and it is before me now. ( a ) Sarah had tried to communicate with him by call and telephone. ( b ) She had finally written him a letter , which he had probably received , but had denied receiving. ( c ) On the night she was murdered he did not dress for dinner , but dined early and went out , carrying the sword-cane. ( d ) From some place , not his house , he telephoned to Judy , offering her mother 's anxiety as an excuse , and asking for Sarah. 112 THE DOOR THE DOOR 113(e) He was out that night for some time . He offered no alibi for those hours , intimating that to do so would affect a woman 's reputation. ( f ) When he returned he still carried the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it had disappeared. ( g ) Also , shortly after that discovery , he had taken to his bed , although actually not ill . From that it was not difficult to go on to the second crime. ( h ) Sarah and Florence Gunther knew each other , probably shared some secret knowledge . The paper Judy had found might or might not refer to that knowledge . Certainly one or the other of them possessed some knowledgeor some physical property , or both , which had been desperately sought for in each case. ( i ) According to Inspector Harrison , the two rooms had been searched by the same individual. ( j ) The oil stain on the carpet of Jim 's car may not be suspicious in itself , but coupled with the above is highly evidential . To this list I added certain queries : ( a ) Would Jim , under any conceivable circumstances , have attacked Judy ? ( b ) Was he capable of such sustained cunning as had been shown throughout ? The planted footprints , for example ? ( c ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sarah 's murder ? If not , had he had time after his telephone message to break into my house ? Fifteen minutes , or at most twenty , was all he had had. ( d ) Was Sarah in Jim 's house for the three hours still unaccounted for ? And under the heading " Florence Gunther " : ( a ) Did Jim know her ? ( b ) Was Jim the visitor testified to by the colored woman at the Bassett house ? ( c ) Why had so cunning a murderer overlooked the oil stain in the car ? I studied this last . Surely were Jim guilty , lying there in his bed he would have gone over inch by inch the ground he had covered ; have thought of every detail , have followed his every act , searched for the possible loose thread in his fabric . He knew he was under suspicion . He had only to raise himself in his bed to see that figure across the street . Then why would he have left that stain in the car ? Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There was more than that . He was definitely under suspicion , and there had been a city-wide search for the " death car , " as the press called it . But either the police had not found that stain , or they had chosen deliberately to ignore it . Why ? Jim Blake and a box of matches could at any time destroy that evidence . It was too much for me . And to add to my anxieties Joseph told me that day that the maids were talking of leaving . Ever since Norah had found the kitchen poker in the laundry the haunting of the house had been an accepted matter , and it was finally getting on their nerves . Yet the remainder of the day was quiet enough , on the surface . Since Wednesday night Judy and Dick had been working over the house clocks at intervals , and that Sunday was no exception . I have no doubt that the servantsthought them slightly mad . One by one the clocks were taken into the library , and there investigated . By and large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wheels , and Dick would sit there over his wreckage , his hair rumpled , and try to reassort what Judy called " the innards . " " Now where the devil does that go ? " " Do n't be such an ass ! Right there . " " It does n't fit . Try it yourself , since you know so much . " And with this very wrangling , which was the cloak to hide their deeper feelings  --  after the fashion of youth today  --  they would be making love to each other . They114 THE DOOR THE DOOR 115would jeer at each other , their mouths hard and their eyes soft . " Keep quiet ! How can I do anything if you jerk my arm ? " " Well , you 're so damned clumsy . " The final result , even the servants ' alarm clocks having been investigated , was that the establishment ran rather erratically . Meals were at queer hours , and I remember that on that very Sunday , with nobody the wiser , we found that we had breakfasted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then that Sunday night at eleven o'clock , or as near that as our ruined time system allowed me to judge , Katherine called up from New York . Howard had had another attack . He was better , but she wanted Judy at home . Judy left the next morning . Dick was working and so I took her to the station , and on the way there I gathered that she and Dick had reached an impasse in their love affair . She stated it quite flatly , after her fashion . " He 's crazy about me , " she said , " but I 'm a child of the rich ! If he condescends to marry me I 'm to live on his salary , and a bit he has outside ! It 's absurd ! It 's sublime ! It 's perfectly barbaric these days for a man to insist on supporting a wife . It 's childish vanity ; the great male I am . ' " It was quite chara eristic of her that she should be crying at the momenzt . But she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 'd rather have things than have Dick " Oh , to the devil with things It 's the principle of the thing . He 'd deprive me to nurse his own vanity . " Well , it is a prop'em which is confronting a good many young people today ; both of them right and both of them wrong . I " ad no solution , and whatever their troubles it had not affected Dick 's feeling toward her , for he came in to see me that night , out of sheer habit . " Tried to pass by , " he said , " but the old bus just naturallyheaded in and stuck its head over the hitching post . " I was glad to see him . I had been very lonely ; missing Judy , even missing  --  to tell the truth  --  the Inspector , with his blue eyes and his toothpicks and his general air of competence . He had deserted me almost completely for several days . And in the expansiveness of that hour , then and there I told Dick @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see here : the first car the police would examine would be that car . " " So I think . But they may know about it , at that . " " You 're sure Amos has n't been carrying oil in it ? " That had not occurred to me . I felt rather foolish , and the net result of the talk was that Dick saw Amosthe next day and learned certain things . On the night of Florence 's death , being a Sunday , he had been out and Jim was alone . But he could not have taken the car out , for Amos carried the key to the small door of the garage from the garden . The main doors to the alley were bolted on the inside . Not that Dick asked these direct questions . He asked Amos where he was on Sunday night , and if any one could have got at the car . But Dick was not satisfied . He watched the negro leave the house on an errand , and then climbed the rear wall into Jim 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the side window into the garagq , lead a broken pane , and it was possible to reach in and unlock the sash . And there were marks on one of the newly painted garden chairs . He got into the building and examined the car . The driving seat and the one next to it were leather and could be washed , but there were no blood tajns . " Amos does n't watch the milea ? e , he said , " so he does n't know whether the car was out or not . But he does suspect that the gas is lower than it ought to be . " 116 THE DOORHe did , however , discover that Amos had carried no oil in the rear of the car . He had said to him : " What 's all this about the carpet being missing ? You 've done away with it yourself , have n't you ? Spilled something on it ? " " No , sir ! " said Amos . " I never carry nothing back there . Mr. Blake 's mighty particular @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , important as it was , did not help us at all . Nothing was clearer than that Jim himself , locked out of the garage , might have placed a garden chair under the window , broken the pane , and taken his car out himself on Sunday night . That was on Tuesday , the tenth of May . Sarah had been dead for three weeks , and Florence Gunther for ten days . Apparently the police had found nothing whatever , and we ourselves had nothing but that cryptic cipher , which was not a cipher at all but a key . I daresay I should have shown it to the police ' , but already I had clone a reckless thing with the carpet and I was uneasy . Then too the Inspector had ceased his almost daily visits , although I saw him once on the Larimerlot , poking about with a stick and the faithful Simmonstrotting at his heels . But he did not come to the house , and soon  --  on Wednesday morning , to be exact  --  I was to receive a message @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Somers was dead . CHAPTER THIRTEENSO FAR I am aware that I have painted a small canvas of the family ; only Judy , Wallie and myself , with a bit of Katherine . As Laura was never involved , it is unnecessary to enlarge on her . She remained in Kansas City , busy with her children , mildly regretful over Sarah but not actively grieved . The one figure I have not touched is Howard Somers Perhaps this is because I never understood him particu- larly , never greatly liked him . Katherine 's passion for him had always mystified me . But Howard was to add his own contribution to our mystery , and that by the simple act of dying . It was not unexpected , although Katherine had sturdily refused to accept it , or to face its possibility . I fancy that there must have been times after that almost fatal attack the summer before when she was abroad , when he must have wanted to talk to her . There are many things in the heart and mind of a man facing death which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that her mother never let him speak . It was as though , by admitting the fact , she would bring it closer . " We really ought to paint the place at Southampton , before we go up next summer , " she would say . And her eyes would defy him , dare him to intimate that there might be no next summer for him . All this I was to learn from Judy later on , trying per- plexedly to understand the situation among the three of ... them , and that strange silence of Howard 's about matters which concerned them all . " Probably he wanted to tell her , poor darling , " she said . " But how could he ? She would n't let him . It 117118 THE DOORwas like Wallie , only worse . She would n't speak about Wallie , you know . " " Do you think he was seeing Wallie ? " She shrugged her shoulders . " He must have been , but he never said anything . He never even told her that Wallie had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose he did n't want to hurt her . " And , without being aware of it , she had drawn a picturefor me which was profoundly to affect my judgment later on ; of the barrier Katherine had for years been erecting between IIoward and his son , and of a relationshipthere perhaps closer than she imagined . The two driven to meetings practically clandestine , and Wallie with Margaret 's charm , her eyes , much of her beauty , making his definite claim on his father 's affection . A conversation I was to have with Doctor Simonds later on was to confirm this . " Whatever their trouble had been , " he said , " they had patched it up . Wallie was there every day . For a night or two he slept there , in the suite . Later on he relieved the nurse for a daily walk . He was Johnny on the spot all through . " He had insisted on knowing his father 's condition , and had gone rather pale when he learned it . " How long ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It might even be longer . " But that was some time later . Howard had died on Tuesday night , or rather some time early on Wednesday morning . A footman called me to the telephone , but it was , of all people in the world , Mary Martin who spoke to me . " I am sorry to have bad news for you , " she began , and went on to tell me . Mr. Somers had seemed fairly well during the evening . Miss Judy had sat with him until after eleven . At eleven Evans , his valet , had broughtTHE DOOR 119a whisky and soda and placed it in his bedroom , and a short time after that Judy had gone to bed . Katherine had found him in the morning , in his dressinggown and slippers , lying across the bed as he had fallen . I took the eleven o'clock train and was at the apartmentat something after two that afternoon . Mary was in the hall when I was admitted , her red head flaming over her decorous black frock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an undertaker'sassistant , and she greeted me with considerable manner . " Mrs. Somers is trying to get some rest , " she said . " Have you lunched , or shall I order something for you ? " " I have lunched , Mary . When did it happen ? " " The doctors think between three and four this morning . It was his heart . " " Then there will be no inquest ? " " Inquest ? " I thought she looked at me strangely , as though I had shocked her . " No . It was not unexpected . " She went on , as she led me to my room . The doctors had not been surprised . He had died very quietly , that was one comforting thing . And she had notified the family . She had called up Mr. Blake , and had telegraphedLaura . Also  --  she hoped this was all right  --  she had sent a wire to Mr. Walter . " Why not ? " I said rather sharply . " He is his son . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be here for the funeral . " Judy was shut away with Katherine , who seemed to be dazed and entirely unprepared . In my room I had time to think . Mary was there , apparently at home ; and as Judy had predicted , Maude Palmer was gone . She had worked fast , I reflected , had Mary Martin . She had been out of my house less than a week , and there she was . I know now what happened , how it came about . Katherinehas told me . On the Friday before Mary had called at the apart- ment and asked for Katherine . Katherine was dictating letters in that small room off the great drawing room which she likes to call her study . She went out and Mary was waiting in the hall , soft voiced and assured . Within the next half hour she had told her things we had never dreamed she knew , about the sword-cane , for example , and Jim 's refusal to alibi himself the night of Sarah 's murder . She knew  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then , bending forward and speaking cau- tiously , she told her that the carpet was missing from Jim 's car . Katherine was stunned . " How do you know that ? " she demanded sharply . " Amos , I suppose . " " Partly Anios . Partly my own eyes . Miss Bell tried to burn it , but it did n't burn . When I went down to breakfast the cook told me the poker was missing , and I found it in the cellar . So I looked about , and the carpet was there . It was in the furnace . " " You 'd swear to that ? " " Not necessarily , " said Mary , and sat waiting for Katherine to comprehend that . Within an hour Katherine had dismissed poor Maude Palmer , who had been her secretary for five years , giving her two months ' salary in advance , and the next morning Mary Martin was threading a new ribbon into the ma- chine in that small neat room where Katherine attended to the various duties of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as she sat there ? Was she exultant or depressed ? She may have been frightened . Indeed , I think now that she was , for some time during that day she asked Katherine not to tell me she was there . " Why ? " Katherine asked . " Miss Bell would be glad to know that you are in a good position . " " She would think I had used what I know , to my own advantage . " Katherine gave that faint cold smile of hers , and the120 THE DOORTHE DOOR 121girl flushed . But in the end she agreed to S , nothing , for a time at least . " Of course , when Miss Judy comes backer she said . " It may be all right then , " Mary said quietly , and turned back to her machine . Incomprehensible , that girl , now as I look bock ; hiding as definitely and more safely than Jim was hiling . She never gave even Katherine the address of her room downtown . She must have felt safe too for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we know now , the night o f ille day she was engaged , she walked out on the Brooklyn ridge and dropped something into the water . She had riot tied a string around it , and as it fell the paper blew fay  --  Then she walked uptown to a branch post o fpce , bought a stamped envelope and sent a note to Wallie , ot giving him her address ; just a line or two . After that she went to her room and " slept very well . " Anyhow there she was , established , settled inthat vants some Park Avenue apartment where a doze1 serants moved quietly about in the early hours of the day , later on to disappear and only emerge on the rirl T 6 of bells or the ritual of the table . What she felt I haV no idea . She adapted herself , I fancy . She had learned a good bit while with me . But she was there for a definite purpose . That over she moved on . Vanished , A queer , girl , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the light of what we now know . I settled down , then , to the hushed routine of a house in mourning . Katherine did not appear . people called , spoke in low voices , went away . Flowers began to arrive , and Mary entered the names of the serijers neatly in a small book . She was to stay there at jtilght now , until after the funeral . I thought she looked changed , not so pretty And rather worn . Once , carrying some cards into her room to be entered , I found her with her head on her desk , and I122 THE DOORthought that she was crying . But she was not crying . Her eyes were defiant and rather hard . I had not the faintest idea that there was any mystery about Howard 's death until I talked to Judy . Then I was fairly stunned . And as the apartment itself figures in that story of hers , I must begin by describing it . It is of the duplex type ; on the lower floor are the large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and Katherine'sstudy . Behind these , along a corridor , lie the long dining room , the pantry , kitchen and servants ' rooms , and above , connecting by a front and rear staircase , are the family rooms ; Katherine 's boudoir connecting with her bedroom , Howard 's study opening from his . Judy 's room , guest chambers , a room for Katherine 's maid and a small sewing and pressing room opening from it , constitutethe remainder of that floor . On that Tuesday evening , then , Judy met Mary in the lower hall preparing to go . Judy was resentful of her presence in the house and inclined to be short with her , but Mary detained her . " I do n't think your father ought to be alone at night , " she said . Judy eyed her . " And why ? " " Because he 's a very sick man . If he  --  if he should take sick in the night , he might n't be able to call for help . " " We have no intention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned away . But she was worried nevertheless , and she spent that evening with Howard in the study off his bedroom . He had a heavy cold and was rather uncomfortable . Mostly he read , and when at eleven o'clock Evans , his valet , brought the highball and placed it beside the bed in the bedroom , she prepared to leave him . What followed she had not yet told her mother . The telephone rang , and Judy herself answered it . ItTHE DOOR 123was for Howard , apparently a long distance call , and he appeared rather surprised when he answered it . " Tonight ? " he said . " Where are you ? It 's pretty late . You 'll be a couple of hours yet . " But in the end he agreed , and Judy said he seemed thoughtful as he hung up the receiver . " Your Uncle Jim , " he said . " He 's motoring up . I thought he was ill . " " He has been , " said Judy , thinking hard . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll upset you . " " Why ? " ? " I do n't know . He 's in trouble , father . Of course it 's silly , but the police are trying to connect him with Sarah , and all that . " " Nonsense ! Why should he want to do away with Sarah ? It 's an outrage . " She wanted to wait up , but he said Jim had been very urgent that his visit be kept a secret . He proposed to come in by the service entrance and up the stairs , and she was to unlock that door on the floor below . He called up the night watchman while she was still there and asked him to admit a visitor there , or better still , to open the door onto the alley and go away . He was smiling when he hung up the receiver . " Probably thinks I 'm receiving my bootlegger , " he said . " Or a lady , father ! " said Judy . " I think I 'll tell mother ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ insistent about that . " She persuaded him to go to bed and see Jim there , and after he was settled she went in and herself gave him a book and fixed his light . " Door unlocked ? " he asked . " All fixed . " He had not touched the whisky in the glass at that time . She remembered that. 124 THE DOORShe kissed him good-night and went to her own room . But she was very uneasy . Flow Jim had escaped surveillancedid not interest her , but she was fearful for Howard ; Jim bursting in on him with that whole hideous story , perhaps begging for help to escape , perhaps  --  she says this entered her mind  --  perhaps even confessing . She heard no footsteps by two o'clock , and she dozed off . At three she wakened suddenly , sat up and finally got up . She went along the corridor to her father 's door , and listened . She could hear voices , one low and quiet , her father 's louder and irritated . Shortly after that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody falling , " she said with a shiver . She had sat up and listened , but it was not repeated , and soon after that she heard Jim come out and close the door . She went to sleep after that . At nine o'clock the next morning she was wakened by a shriek and the sound of a chair being overturned . Quick as she had been to throw on a dressing gown and run out , Mary Martin was before her . She was standing staring into Howard 's room , where Katherine lay in a faint on the floor , and Howard was quite peacefully dead across his bed . He was in his dressing gown , a thing of heavy dark brocade , and his face according to Judy was very quiet and very peaceful . Whatever his last thoughts had been , if indeed he had any , they were wiped clean . Some weeks afterward Inspector Harrison was to give me a little talk on just such things . " There is no expression on a dead face , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a slate . All this stuff about expressions of horror on murdered people is pure nonsense . I 've seen a fellow beaten to death , and he looked as peaceful as though he 'd died in his bed . " Judy called for help , and the servants flocked in . Katherine 's maid , a hysterical Frenchwoman , was entirely helpless , and it was Mary Martin who threw up the win-3ows and ran into Howard 's bedroom for water . THE DOOR 125 " But she dropped the glass , " said Judy , gazing at me with reddened eyes . " She took the highball glass from beside the bed and dropped it on the bathroom floor . It broke into bits . I want to know why she did that . There were glasses in the bathroom . " I tried to reassure her . After all , her father had been a dying man for some time . And any one might drop a glass . But she was not satisfied . " How did she get there so quickly ? " she demanded . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I advised her to say nothing , especially to Katherine in her grief . But she only made a small gesture . " She 'll know soon enough that Uncle Jim was here , " she said . " The night watchman saw him . And he told Evans this morning when he heard that father was  --  gone . All the servants know it , probably . " " He recognized your Uncle Jim " I do n't know . He knows somebody was here . " " And the doctors ? They think everything is all right ? I mean , that it was his heart ? " " Why would they think anything else ? " she said drearily . " If it was poison " " Hush , Judy . " I got through the remainder of the day somehow ; not for years had we faced an emergency without Sarah , and I missed her now . Sarah would have taken hold ; would have put Katherineto bed matter of factly and with authority , have driven out that hysterical Frenchwoman who was wringingher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all sedatives or got the doctor to order them , and then flatfootedlyand as if death were as normal as living , have read a book until we were all safely asleep . But Sarah was gone . Florence Gunther was gone . And now Howard . CHAPTER FOURTEENWALLIE arrived that evening . Katherine was stilt shut in her room . Now and then Judy would wanderin , but Katherine was absorbed in her grief , alone with it . She would kiss Judy and then forget she wasthere . But she made a ghastly mistake when she refused to see Wallie . One gesture from her then , one bit of recognition of their common grief , their common loss , and things would have been different . Whatever might be his weaknesses , Wallie had cared about his father , and he looked stricken when I went in to see him . His face was blank and expressionless , and he had little to say . He sat slumped in his chair , and for the first time I saw a hint of gray in his hair . He was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been fifty as he sat there . " It was the heart , of course ? " " Yes . It was bound to come before long , anyhow , Wallie . " He seemed to hesitate , to bring his next question out with an effort . " Then there was no post-mortem ? " " No . " " I asked for her , but I suppose she wo n't see me . " " She 's not seeing any one , Wallie . I have n't seen her myself . " " Does she know I 'm here ? " he insisted . " I told her , yes . Through the door . She 's quite shut away , Wallie . " But I did not tell him that I had urged her and had been refused . It had seemed to me that death ought to wipe out old angers , old jealousies . But she had been coldly stubborn , would not even unlock her door. 126THE DOOR 127 " I have no intention of seeing him , Elizabeth . Do go away . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? He seems to think it is important . " " Nothing is important , and I never want to see hind again . " Of course that was pure hysteria , but no man has ever understood a woman 's hysteria . Mary Martin came in just then with a number of telegrams , but he did not so much as look at her . She glanced at him , waited a moment , then put down the telegramsand went quietly away . " Give her a little time , Wallie , " I begged him . " No , " he said . " She 's had her chance . I 'm through . " His face had hardened . It was as though he had come with some overture of peace , and the impulse had died as I looked at him . He was standing in the big drawing room , with its tapestries , its famous paintings , its wellknowncollection of eighteenth century French furniture , and I saw him look around as if appraising it . Then he smiled unpleasantly . " She has good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bad judgment . I daresay I can see him ? After all , he was my father . " I asked no one 's permission for that , and he had had about five minutes alone with Howard before he left . Judy took him to the door and left him there . It must have been five minutes of pure agony , knowing what we know now , but he came out quietly enough . When he left I thought I saw Mary waiting in the hall , but she disappeared when she saw me . She was staying for the night , working late in order to attend to all the detail , and I could still hear her at her desk when at last I went up to bed . But I did not sleep . I had taken two cups of coffee , and my mind was racing like a mill stream . The news that Jim Blake had been with Howard , that for all his pretended illness he had driven his car the night before128 THE DOOR - THE DOOR 129to New York , arriving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profound shock . True , that might have been explicable . He was iii great trouble . He might have felt the need of Howard , of some balanced judgment . But suppose that the shock of his story had destroyed Howard ? Suppose he had died before Jim left ? Suppose the thud Judy had heard had been his body as it fell ? Then why had Jim slipped away like a thief in the night ? His own sister in a room beyond , with only her boudoir intervening , and he had not called her . It seemed monstrous , inhuman . Then of course Judy 's suspicions played their part . We would probably never know the truth . Unless we told Katherine the whole story she would never permit an examination of the body , and to tell her the story was to involve her own brother . So I turned and re-turned . How long could this visit be kept under cover ? Not long . The servants knew , and from the servants to Mary Martin was only a step . Then , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ argue ? That Jim had made a confession to Howard , and that the shock had killed him ? Certainly they could argue that this secret visit of Jim 's was not the act of a consciously innocent man . But what did any of them know , after all ? That IInwardhad had a visitor , but not necessarily that visitor 's identity . Or did Mary suspect who that visitor had been ? Moving in her mysterious way among us all , never of us but among us , unfathomable , shrewd , unscrupulous when she chose to be , she had her own methods , her own purposes . Suppose then that she made inquiries downstairs ? Suppose she had talked to the night watchman , got a description of the visitor , was proposing to give that descriptionto Wallie ? And Wallie perhaps already suspicious , asking about a post-mortem , maybe about to demand one . Still , she had broken the glass . Why should she do that ? What picture had been in her mind ? Did she ' suspect or did she know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beside the bed , and I-Toward drinking it ? Sitting there , talking maybe , and drinkingit . Where was the glass now ? She had broken it , but the pieces would be somewhere about . Suppose they were , and Wallie was suspicious ? Suppose he had gone to the police that night , and early morning would find the trash-can examined , and Jim 's guilt proved beyond a doubt ? I thought that it would kill Katherine . Outside it was raining , a heavy spring shower . I got out of bed and paced the floor in my bare feet , to the accompaniment of heavy thunder and the beating of the rain on neighboring roofs . Suppose I got those pieces of glass and disposed of them ? Hid them and then carried them off ? Dropped them in a river or out of the window of a railway carriage ? Innocent or guilty , they would be gone . Looking back , I know that I was not entirely normal that night , but I was on the verge of desperation . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not even seem to be important that Jim Blake might be a cold-blooded and deadly killer ; what mattered was that it should not lie known , that we be allowed to go back to our quiet lives once more , that no scandal break to involve us all . So , thinking or not thinking , I put on a dressing gown and went quietly down the stairs . As I have said , the dining room , kitchen , pantries and so on are at the rear of a long hall . One passes from the dining room through a butler 's pantry into the kitchen , and beyond the kitchen , opening from a rear hallway , is a small cement-floored room in which is the dumb-waiter by which refuse cans and so on are lowered to the basement , there to be collected . This room I knew well . Duringthe day it was there that the boxes had been taken130 THE DOORas the flowers were unwrapped , and when last I saw it that day it had been waist deep in paper . To this room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there is no access to it other than by the one door , and I felt my way along in the darkness , fearful of rousingthe servants . But outside the door I stopped , almost paralyzed with amazement . Some one was in the room . There was the stealthy movement of paper , the sound of a lid being fitted cautiously onto a can . It took all my courage to fling that door open , and for a moment , after the darkness , the blaze of light almost blinded me . Then I saw , sitting calmly on the floor , Mary Martin . She was looking at me with a half smile , and the light on her red hair was positively dazzling . " Good heavens , how you scared me ! " she said . " What on earth are you doing here ? " " I could n't sleep , " she said , " and I got to worrying about a card . That bunch of orchids and lilies of the valley  --  the card 's been thrown away . " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Now she ran her fingers through the debris , the flotsam and jetsam of the day ; a chipped cup , bits of string , old envelopes , even sweepings from the floors . And suddenly she picked something up and waved it before me . " Here it is , " she said . " Now I can sleep in peace . " I do not know why I felt that she was acting . Perhapsthe open window had something to do with it ; the rain driving in and blowing over her , and that assumptionof hers that this was as it should be ; that she liked sitting in that chaos and allowing the rain to wet one of those alluring negligees which she affected . " Why do n't you close that window ? " She drew her kimono about her , and got up . " I will , " she said . " Not that I suppose it matters here . " And then , at the window with her back to me , I saw her release her clutch oiz the kimono @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I saw her lower the window with one hand . I knew then that she had dropped something over the sill . And I saw another thing . There were no bits of glass among the trash on that paper . If she had thrown them out , as I suspected , the rain would wash them clean of evidence . They were gone . But lying in bed later on I was bewildered beyond thought . Had this unfathomable girl lain awake as I had , reached the same conclusion , acted on the same impulse ? Or was there something more sinister there , some knowledge I did not possess which she did ? And once again I was back in my house at home , hearing that desperateweeping of hers . " It 's nothing . I was low in my mind . That 's all . " I have rather a confused memory of the next two days . I recall that early the next morning I made an excursion into the courtyard of the building , but without much result . It was still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very small pieces of glass , there was nothing large enough to he worth salvage . Which was not surprising , considering that if I was right they had had a sheer drop of twelve stories . Dick Carter appeared on Thursday . I did not know he had come until I saw him in the library with Judy . I happened to walk in on them , and I saw at once that things were not well between them . He was standing at a window , staring out , and Judy was huddled in a chair . " I do n't see what difference it makes , " she was saying . " Do n't you ? Well , I do . " Nevertheless , it was from Dick that I got the first intimation that some one besides myself was suspicious of Howard 's death . Judy had disappeared , but the boy stayed around after she had gone , uncomfortable but apparently determined . " I suppose it 's all right ? " he said to me . " No chance of anything queer , eh ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do you think ? " " I do n't know . Suppose Blake told him something and the shock killed him ; that 's not murder . That is , supposing it was Blake . " " Good heavens ! Do you think it was some one else ? " " Well , figure it out for yourself . Blake 's sick , or he says he is . But he comes here in the middle of the night , driving his own car for ninety-odd miles , sees Mr. Somers and gets back , presumably , at daylight or thereabouts . That 's some drive for a sick man . Then all this secrecy . Why ? The police could n't have stopped him if he 'd wanted to take a train and come here . They 've got nothing on him yet . All he had to do was to pack a bag and come . Or hire an ambulance ! He 's coming for the funeral , is n't he ? " I sat clown . My knees were shaking . Dick looked at his watch . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have n't an idea . " " Well , he 's the boy to see . " I made up my mind then to tell him about Mary and the glass , and I did so . He listened attentively , but when I told him she had actually found the card , and that I was not certain she had thrown anything from the window , he made rather light of it . " Wait a minute , " he said . " Now either we 've got another crime or we have n't . In the first place , who would want to kill a man who had only a few months to live anyhow ? But grant that . Grant that there was poison in the glass . Something quick , like cyanide . First we have to admit that Howard Somers , drinking a highball , is talking to some one he knows , and trusts . He 's not scared . He 's drinking a highball . But you 've got to go further ; you 've got to figure that ' Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how . Yet she warns Judy that he 's not to be left alone at night . Only did she do that ? " " I have n't an idea , " I said dismally . " I suppose there 's no chance of a post-mortem ? " " Not unless we told Mrs. Somers ; and not then . It 's her brother who is involved . " Naturally we said nothing to Judy of all this , and the day passed quietly enough , people coming and going , more flowers , and Mary keeping her neat entries and moving decorously about . Once I caught her eyes on me , a curious speculative look in them , and I thought she was depressed all of that day . Late in the afternoon she asked to be allowed to go home for the night , and I told her to go . She remained to dinner and left at nine o'clock , and at nine-fifteen Dick called me on the telephone . " Listen , " he said , " I 'm at a drug store around the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something in what we discussed today . " " Yes ? " " The lady in question  --  do you get that ? " " Yes . All right . " " She 's been interviewing the night watchman . Interesting , is n't it ? Just thought I 'd tell you , so you can keep an eye on things . " He hung up the receiver , and I was left to make of that what I could . I remember that Alex Davis was there that night , Howard 's attorney . He was settled comfortably in the library with a glass of old port at his elbow , and what with the port and probably an excellent dinner tucked away , he was unusually talkative . A fat man , Alex Davis , with small sharp black eyes set in a broad expanse of face . " I suppose you know , " he said , " that there will be a great deal of money . More , I fancy , than any one realizes . Poor Howard was a secretive man . " " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A very fair one , I think . He 's taken care of the servants and certain charities , and there is provision too for Mrs. Somers ' brother . " 134 THE DOOR THE DOOR 135 " And Wallie ? " I asked . He cleared his throat . " He has already done a good bit for Wallie . Certain businesses which failed , and last summer certain notes to be paid . But there is a very fair arrangement ; a trust fund with a substantial income . Not large . Substantial . Of course this is in confidence . I am one of the executors . " And I saw that this last pleased him ; that it was a vote of confidence , as well as providing certain emoluments ; that already he saw his name in the press everywhere ; the size of the estate , the inheritance tax royalty calculated . " Mr. Alexander Davis and the Guaranty Trust Company , executors . " He leaned back and patted his substantial abdomen . " Howard was a money maker , " he said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was not listening very attentively . I was thinking of Mary and of that conversation with the night watchman , and after Alex Davis had taken his complacent departure I wandered into Katherine 's study and looked about me . The desk was cleared . There was no sign of those small personal belongings which she was wont to keep by her . Nor were they in the drawers of the desk , or any place else . It came to me with a shock of surprise that Mary Martinhad gone , and gone for good . Jim arrived at noon the next day , for the funeral . Save for a certain pallor  --  he had been in the house for over three weeks  --  he seemed much as usual ; impeccably dressed , with a black tie and a black band on the left sleeve of his coat . I had no chance whatever to talk to him . He went at once to Katherine 's room , and their luncheon was served to them there . Only during the solemn process of carrying Howard 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ services . But that seems to have been sufficient . Some time in that slow and affecting progress Jim came face to face with an individual whom I was later to know as Charles Parrott , a man of middle age , with a cap drawn low over his face . This Parrott was carrying in the chairs usually provided for such occasions , and was opening them and placing them in rows , and as Jim passed him he gave him a long steady look . Jim did not notice him , apparently . I was not there at the time . The name Charles Parrottmeant nothing to me . But in due time Charles Parrott was to play his own part in our tragedy , to make his own contribution to the tragic denouement which was to follow . For Charles Parrott , introduced by Dick by methods of which I have no knowledge , was the night watchman of the building . And he identified Jim Blake as being of the same build and general appearance as that visitor to Howard whom he had admitted two nights before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a positive statement . " He 's the same build . He looks like him . But that 's as far as I go . " So Jim moved about , unsuspicious , changing the flowers , softening the lights , and Parrott watched him . He disappeared when Jim had gone upstairs again , to remain with Katherine and Judy during the services . Wallie was not asked to join them . He was left to sit alone , where he chose . A cruel thing , perhaps ; a stupid thing certainly . Katherine had taken the strongest affectionhe had ever felt , the deepest grief , and flung them back in his face . So he sat alone , rigid and cold during the services , and stood alone at his father 's grave . However he had wavered before , some time then he made his decision . He went that night to call on Alex Davis , sitting complacentand smug in his library , and slammed out only a136 THE DOORhalf hour later , leaving Alex in a state bordering on apoplexy . Half an hour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment and demanding to see Katherine . He was admitted and taken up to her , but Judy and I knew nothing of all this until later . Judy had determined to talk to Jim , and asked me to be present in the library . " I ca n't stand it any longer , " she said . " He was here . Why does n't he speak up ? He must know that watchmansaw him . Even if father was  --  was alive when he left , why does n't he say something ? " But Jim 's reaction to her first question was a surprise to both of us . IIe denied , immediately , categorically , and almost violently , that he had made any visit to Howard Somers on the night of his death . " Here ? " he said . " Why , it 's madness . Why should I have come like that ? You 've lost your good common sense , Judy . " " Some one was here and used your name . He telephonedon the way , from somewhere in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , he looked ghastly . Not only was there the implication that Howard had been murdered , but there was the terrible possibility which the situation held for himself . What was he to do , where to turn ? To go to Katherine and demand that the body be exhumed ? And that with the police watching him , and maybe poison to be found ? All that he must have thought of , sitting there so neat and dapper in his chair . " It 's terrible , " he said . " It 's all terrible . And this night watchman ? He says he recognized me ? " " He says the man was your height and build . " Suddenly he was savagely angry . " And so this fellow , this Parrott  --  he 's in the secret , is he ? He 's been brought here to look me over ! Good God , Judy , do you want to send me to the chair ? I was n't here . How the hell couldTHE DOOR 137 , I get here ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here that night , using my name and impersonating me , he was a liar and an impostor , and before God I believe he was a murderer too . Why should I have come here in the night ? I could come at any time . " Then he quieted , although he was still shaking . " Does your mother know anything of all this ? " " Nothing . " " Then keep it from her . You can do that much . She is in great trouble . " " So am I in great trouble , " said Judy bitterly . " But I suppose that does n't matter . " He looked at her . " You believed it , did you ? Do you still believe it ? " " I do n't know . No , of course not . " " Judy , " he said , more gently , " what motive could I have ? What possible reason ? Your father was my , friend . To put the thing boldly , what could I possibly gain by his death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if in answer to his question a footman knocked at the door and said that Katherine wanted to see him in her room . I have no picture of that scene , but I can see it : Katherinefrozen in her chair and Alex Davis walking the floor , and after a habit of his snapping his fingers as he walked . Into that scene Jim was projected , and in forcible language he was told what Wallie had said . Briefly , Wallie had claimed that , during his illness the summer before , his father had made a second will . That this will was in Howard 's safe deposit box at the bank in New York , and the copy in the hands of Waite and Henderson , Mr. Waite having personally drawn it , here ' in my own city . By this will , Wallie received no trust fund and no annuity , but a full half of the estate , and the previous will had been revoked . The new will made no provision whatever , either for Sarah or for Jim. 138 THE DOOR @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still apparently confused , But Alex Davis snapped his fingers with excitement , and said that if so it was fairly circumstantial lying . " He 's even got the names of the witnesses , " he said , and drawing a slip of paper from his pocket he read themealoud . " Sarah Gittings and Florence Gunther . " I believe it was then that Jim collapsed . Naturally I knew nothing of this at the time , nor did Judy . Both Katherine and Jim were still shut in their rooms when I left early the next morning . But I was sufficiently dismayed and confused . If we were to believe Jim  --  and I did  --  then the possibility of a third murder was very real . And once more , sitting in the train , I endeavored to fit together the fragments of that puzzle . I saw Howard , that night , waiting in his room , settled in his bed , the highball beside him , a book in his hand . Getting up to admit his visitor , finding it was not Jim @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on his dressing gown and slippers , talking . Judy had heard them talking . Some one lie knew , then ; knew and trusted . Was it Wallie ? Wallie was not unlike Jim in build , although taller and slimmer . Might not that be the answer , and no poison , no third murder . A talk between father and son , and then Wallie going and the heart attack after he had gone . I admit that this comforted me . I sat back and tried to read . Shortly before the train drew in to the station Dick Carter came through the car . He looked depressed , but he forced a smile when he saw me . " Well , " he said , " I 'm back on the job ! Even funerals ca n't last forever . " He sat down in the empty chair next to mine , and said that Judy had telephoned him of Jim 's denial . " She believes him , " he said . " In that case  --  this Martingirl seems to be fairly vital . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , does n't it ? Take that glass , forTHE DOOR 139instance . She thought fast that morning and she was still thinking that night . It 's not coincidence , all that glass stuff . Get why she did that , and we 've got somewhere . Where does she come in in all this , anyhow ? " " I wish I knew . " " Tell me something about her , " he said , leaning forward . " Who is she ? What do you know about her ? " " Nothing , really . She answered an advertisement last fall . I tried her out , and she was efficient . Very . She had no local references . " " And on that you tools her into the house ? To live ? " " Not at first . But she was really very capable , and sometimes I work at night . I rather drifted into it . " He was silent for some time . Then he made a circle on a piece of paper and marked it around with perhaps a. dozen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but without the hands , when he held it out to me . " This dial thing , " he said . " It may not refer to a clock , you know . It might be a safe . You have n't a safe in the house , have you ? " " No . " " A safe , or something resembling a clock , but not necessarily a clock . Something round . Would that mean anything to you ? A picture , maybe ? Have you any round pictures , with nails at the back ? " " One or two . I can examine them . " The train was drawing in . He helped me into my wraps , and wP sat down again while we were being slowly moved into the station . " I suppose , " he said , not looking directly at me , " that you realize what all this has done to me ? " " To you ! " " About Judy . I 'll be nobody 's kept husband , andJudy 's got a couple of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Judy has a right to a vote on that , has n't she ? " " She 's voted . She 'll keep the money . " " I do n't believe it . " " Well , the equivalent of that . She says I 'm a poor140 THE DOORmean-spirited creature to refuse to let her support me in luxury . She says it takes a strong man to marry money , and I 'm weak or I 'd do it . " Then the train stopped . I was glad to get home , to find Robert at the station and Joseph at the open door . I like my servants ; I have to live with them , and so when I do not like them they must go . And the house was cool and quiet , after New York . I relaxed at once under Joseph 's care ; the welllaidtea table , the small hot rolls , the very smoothness and greenness of the lawns outside the windows . For the first time since Sarah 's death I felt secure . Surely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tragedies , according to the old superstition . I leaned back and looked at Joseph , and for the first time I realized that he was pale , almost waxy . " Have you been ill , Joseph ? " " No , madam . I have had an accident . " " An accident ? What sort of an accident ? " But as it turned out , Joseph had had no accident . Dragged out of him , and later corroborated by the maids came the story of an attack in broad daylight so mysteriousand so brutal that it made my blood run cold . The story was this : on the afternoon of the day I left for New York , he had allowed the women servants to go out . He often did this in my absence , getting himself a supper of sorts , and apparently glad to have his pantry to himself . The house was locked and Robert was washing the car in the garage . According to Robert , and this was later found to be true , the first knowledge he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when he heard a faint rapping on the pantry window and looking toward the house , saw a bloody head , wavering with weakness , inside . Robert was frightened . He made no effort to get into the house alone , but summoned a white chauffeur from the garage of my bootlegger neighbor , and the two ofTHE DOOR 141them broke open the basement door and rushed up the stairs . They found Joseph unconscious on the pantry floor , his head bleeding profusely from a bad cut , and as Doctor Simonds later discovered , his body a mass of bruises . It was two hours before he recovered consciousness , and then he could give no description of his assailant . " I saw and heard nobody , " he told me . " I was on the second floor . It looked like rain and I was closing the windows . I had finished that and was about to go down the back staircase when I felt that some one was behind me . But I never saw who it was . The next thing I remember , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , trying to crawl to the pantry . " And this story of his was borne out by the fact that the maids later found blood on the stairs and a small pool at the bottom . Doctor Simonds however did not place too much confirm dence in the story of the attack , when he came in that night to see me . " Sure he was hurt , " he said , with that cheerful descent into the colloquial with which the medical profession soothes its fearful patients and its nervous women . " Surest thing I ever saw . It took four stitches to sew him up ! But why assault ? Why did n't Joseph catch his rubber heel on something and pitch down those stairs of yours ? There are twenty odd metal-edged steps there , and every one got in a bit of work . " " He says he felt that there was some one behind him . " " Exactly . He was stepping off as he turned to look ; and why he did n't break that stiff neck of his I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he 's up and about . " But Joseph stuck to his story . He had been attacked by some one from the rear , armed either with a club or a chair . And as we know now , he was right . Joseph had indeed been murderously assaulted , and very possibly left for dead . As it happened , it was during that call of Doctor142 THE DOORSimonds ' that I first learned of the possibility that Howard had left a second will . He had attended Howard during his illness at the Imperial the summer before , and expressed regret over his death . " Of course it was bound to come , " he said . " He knew it . He was not a man you could deceive , and that attack he had here was a pretty bad one . By the way , did he alter his will at that time ? Or do you know ? " " Alter it ? I do n't know , I 'm sure . " " He was thinking of it . Walter had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peace between them . It was rather amusing , in a way . Poor Miss Gittingshated Walter , and she would have kept him out if she could . " " I hope he did change the will , " I said , thoughtfully . " After all , his only son " He may , and he may not . I talked it over with Walter , and he said there would be hell to pay if it did happen . He was n't sure , of course . But he got me to give him a letter , to the effect that his father was capable ( of drawing such a document ; not under drugs , or mentallyenfeebled . ' " He laughed a little . " Mentally enfeebled. ' " he said . " If Howard Somers was mentally enfeebled I wish I had arterio-sclerosis ! " But Joseph 's injury had made me most uneasy . What was the motive ? What had been gained by it ? I must confess that once again I considered the possibility of a killer who killed for the sheer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ revolver for Josrrph , and moved him to a guest room on the second floor . Before he retired I made the round of the house with him , and even of the garage and the cellars . Then , with my own door locked , I was able to pass a quiet if not an easy night . But again I did not sleep . I lay in bed with a pencil and a sheet of paper , and tried that night to put together what we knew about this unknown . I wrote down that he was crafty and physically strong ; that he hac noTHE DOOR 143scruples about taking human life ; that he knew my house even to the detail of the airshaft and its window ; that he was  --  at least probably  --  of the same height and build as Jim Blake ; that my dogs knew him ; that , although since Sarah 's death the front door lock had been changed , he was still able  --  if Joseph 's story were accurate  --  to enter my house at will ; and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and destroyed Sarah and Florence Gunther and possibly Howard , and might in the end affect others , God only knew who . I was badly frightened by that time , and when just as I had finished the list I heard the stealthy padding of feet in the hall , I was in a cold sweat of terror . It was only Jock , however , moving restlessly about , with the call of the spring night in his blood and a closed and doublelockedfront door between him and his kind . THE DOOR 143CHAPTER FIFTEENT HE next day I went through my house , acting on Dick 's suggestion . I imagine that the servants thought that our recent tragedies had slightly unbalanced me , as I took down one circular object after another and examined it . One or two old daguerreotypes in round frames I literally ripped open , but at the end of these acts of vandalism I was no wiser than before . It was that afternoon that I was sent for by the DistrictAttorney ; a disquieting interview , with accusation and suppressed anger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " This is a curious case , Miss Bell , " he said . " Two horrible crimes have been committed by the same hand , and two attacks , one of them certain ; the other , on your butler , at least possible . We have either a maniac loose in the community , or we have a motive so carefully concealedthat so far we have not found it . I think there is a motive . Of the two women killed , one was apparently negligible , without background . The other had no backgroundsave a certain family , to which she had been loyal and from which she had certainly received a considerable measure of confidence . These two women became friends ; the secret of one became the secret of the other . Therefore , granting there was some detrimental knowledge , when one died the other must die . That 's simple . But the family in question has done nothing to help the law . It has even withheld certain matters from the police . " " I deny that , absolutely . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss Bell ? If this case comes to trial , and you are put under oath on the witness stand " How can it come to trial ? You have made no arrest . " 144But he ignored that . " I want to urge you to tell what you know , Miss Bell , as a public duty . You owe that to the community . If there is a man of this description loose , a wholesale murderer , shrewd , without conscience or scruple , defeating justice to serve his own ends , then your obligation lies plain before you . " " I know nothing . If you think you are describing Jim Blake , I do not . He is as innocent as you are . " He bent forward . " Then why did you burn the carpet from his car ? You need not answer that . We know that you did . We are not guessing . " " If you are going to try to convict a man on purely circumstantial evidence " " What is circumstantial evidence ? It is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Your door belt rings ; you have not seen anybody at the door , but you know that somebody is there , ringing that bell . That 's circumstantial evidence . " He leaned back and spoke more quietly . " This cane , " he said , " the one with the hidden blade . How wide was that blade ? " " It was very narrow ; perhaps a half inch at the widesi part . It tapered . " " And it had a double cutting edge ? " " I do n't remember . " " You have n't seen it since you gave it to Jim Blake ? " " Not since . " " And when did you give it to him ? " " I 've already told you that ; last March . He had ad , mired it . " " Did he ask for it ? " " Hardly that . He said if I ever wanted to get rid of it , he would take it . " " He dropped in to see you rather often ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " And where did you sit , when he called ? " 146 THE DOOR " In my library , usually . " On my way out I saw Mr. Henderson , of Waite and Henderson , and bowed to him . It seemed to me that he looked worried and upset , but I laid this to the death of Florence and its continuing mystery , and thought no more of it . That was on Saturday , May the fourteenth , and that night Inspector Harrison came in . He looked tired and rather untidy , and when he took off his overcoat a flashlightfell to the floor . For some reason he brought it into the library with him , and sat snapping it on and off as he talked . Perhapshe was out of his customary ammunition . He beganrather apologetically . " I 've got the habit of dropping in here , " he said . " I suppose it 's because I like to talk and you 're willing to listen . " " I daresay , " I observed , " although @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " That embarrassed him . He smiled rather dubiously , gave me a quick glance , and then proceeded quite calmly to focus the flashlight on my feet . " You see , " he said . " I 've been studying those molds I took . It 's my belief that they were made with a woman'sshoe . Not that sort ; a big woman 's shoe . Flat heeled and sensible , and considerably worn . A woman who walked on the outsides of her feet ; maybe bandy legged . " " I assure you , Inspector " " No need of it , " he said politely . " But before I go I 'd like to look over the closets here . Somebody appears to have pretty free access to this house , and it 's just possible we 'll locate that pair of shoes . " He made no immediate move , however . He surveyed himself rather ruefully . " I 've been tramping about , " he explained . " It 's a curious thing , but things can be seen at night @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on furniture . In theTHE DOOR 14'i " daylight it looks like varnish , but in a good electric light it often shows up . Then take marks in the ground . Look at what your car headlights do ! I 've slowed down for a rut no deeper than my finger . " " And now you have found something ? " " Well , I have , " he said . " It 's bad news for you , Miss Bell . It 's like this ; I went to the museum and looked at one of those sword sticks they have there . They look like other sticks , but there 's one difference . The ferrule is open at the bottom . When you put it down on the ground it makes a circle , not a hole . I took it out and tried it . You get the idea , do n't you ? A ring is what it makes . In the one in the museum the blade is loose , so it makes a ring with a dot in the center . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blade is hung better . There 's only the ring . " I could hardly speak . " And you 've found such rings ? " " A dozen of them . Maybe two dozen . I 've got them marked and covered , and tomorrow we 'll lift them . I thought I 'd better tell you . " " Then Jim " He was there , all right . There are a half dozen of the things in the bridle path between the sewer and the foot of the hill ; and there are others on the side of the hill . What 's more , I think I have found what stunned Sarah Gittings before she died . " It appears , then , that the examination of poor Sarah 's body had shown more than we had known . The wound at the back of her head had been made with a blunt instrument , as we had been told ; but the nature of that instrument was unknown . However , inspection had shown in her hair and in the wound itself numerous small fragments of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been dragged , and that would account for some of it . But there was bark deeply buried in the tissues . And there was another thing : the blow had been struck from above . The lower side of the148 THE DOORwound was torn . Either she had been struck by a very tall man , or she was sitting down . I had to argue like this ; we 'll leave out the tall man for the minute , and say she was sitting down . Now where does a woman like that sit , if she 's out in the open ? She 's a neat woman , very orderly , and she is n't young . She does n't sit on the ground . She finds a tree stump , or a fallen tree or a stone , and she sits on that . " But he had been some time in coming to that , and Florence 's death had interfered . There had been rain , too , and sunlight . Sunlight , it appeared , faded blood . That night , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was looking for . Near a fallen tree at the top of the hill , and perhaps forty feet from where the dogs had been tied , he had turned his flashlight on the broken branch of a tree , about four feet long , and both heavy and solid . When he turned it over , on the ( side protected from rain and weather , he had found stains and one or two hairs . He had wrapped it up carefully and sent it back to headquarters . I felt sick . " And you found the marks of the sword-stick there , too ? " " Well , no . But that 's not surprising . A man does n't walk up to commit a murder swinging a stick . He crept up behind her . I doubt if she knew anything until it was all over . " I was thinking desperately . " This sword-stick in the museum , would the blade of such a stick have made the other wounds ? " " They would , " he said promptly . " But we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stab wounds look alike . You ca n't tell whether a blade has had two cutting edges or one . You see , every knife has two cutting edges at the point . Take this knife here . " He drew a substantialone from his pocket . " It cuts both ways for half an inch . No . Taken by itself , the fact that Jim BlakeTHE DOOR 149carried that stick that night does n't prove that he used it , or that it 's the weapon that was used . It 's the rest of the case  --  " He had said what he came to say . There had been no new developments in the death of Florence Gunther . The bullet had been fired at close range , and from the left . The point of entry was a neat hole , but on the other side there had been some destruction . He was inclined to believe with Dick that she had been shot while in a car , and in front of or near my property . " Even a head wound bleeds some , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is generally pretty  --  well , pretty messy . Of course that may be wrong . She may have been stunned first like Sarah Gittings ; and killed in the country somewhere . " He got up to go , and as he stood there with the light shining down on his bald head , I saw that like the rest of us he looked tired and depressed . " There are times , " he said , " when I do n't like this job of mine . And this is one of them . Take you . Take little Miss Judy . She 's got troubles enough just now , and the chances are that in a day or two we 're going to add to them . " " You 're going to arrest Jim Blake ? " " I 'm going to do just that , Miss Bell . I do n't mind telling you that we think we 've got the motive . Maybe you know about it , maybe you do n't . But we 've got the motive now , and we know he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to find that sword-stick first . " He was on his way to the door when I stopped him . " How did you know I had burned that carpet , Inspector ? " " Well , somebody had burned it , and it looked as though you might be the guilty party . " " But how did you know ? " He gave me a whimsical glance . " Did you ever examine one of those things , Miss Bell ? Well , I 'll tell you something maybe you do n't know .  --  150 THE DOORThat carpet had snaps  --  or buttons  --  on it to fasten it to the floor ; and those snaps are metal . They wo n't burn . A smart man now , going carefully through certain ashcans , can find them without any trouble . " He turned , his hand on the door knob . " But I 'll say this to you , Miss Bell , in confidence . I 'd like to know why you burned that carpet . I 'd been over that car myself with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If you found anything in it , you 're smarter than I am . " I could only stare at him in silent stupefaction . " Never mind , then , " he said . " You think it over . There 's no hurry . " And with that he left . It was only after he had gone that I remembered the shoes he had meant to examine . I had two clays in which to think that over , although thinking did me no good whatever . I had burned the carpet and thus put a weapon against Jim in the hands of the District Attorney , and no statement by the Inspectorthat he had found nothing suspicious on or about it would alter that . They would believe , as he believed , that I had found something incriminating there which they had overlooked . But mingled with this was a sense of relief . If they had not found the oil stains on the day after Florence 's murder it was because they were not there . Those two days , however , were all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as though there had been no murder of our poor Sarah , or of Florence ; as though there had been no mysterious unknown , able to enter my house at will on some equally mysterious errand . But by the third day , Tuesday , I began to relax . Nobody had been arrested . Life was once more a quiet round of breakfast tray , lunch and dinner . I even prepared to go over my notes on my father 's biography , as a matter of morale ; that poor endeavor we all make in THE DOOR 151trouble to provide some sort of protective mechanism for the mind . So I got out the material . Mary 's neatly typed pages , my own illegible jottings , and those ruled notebooks in which Mary had taken down my dictation . Their queer symbols meant nothing to me ; they were as unfathomableas the girl herself . And it occurred to me , sitting there , that these books written in her hand , were all that remained to any of us of Mary Martin . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A queer girl , with her poses , her defiant beauty , and her faculty of being around where there was trouble ; or of carrying it with her . Who could say which ? I turned over the pages , but although here and there I found notes in longhand  --  " Send to Laura for daguerreotypes " I recall was one of them , and another " Have Joseph find out about terrapin for dinner party "  --  there was nothing of any value until I reached what appeared to be the latest book . Not on the pages , but inside the cover in ink , she had written : " New number , East i6 . " Now I happen to have a peculiar faculty , one born of necessity , for I frequently forget my glasses . I have a flair for remembering telephone numbers . And this number ran familiarly in my mind . It did not come at once . I sat back and closed my eyes , and at last it came . I saw Dick Carter sitting at my desk , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then I knew . Dick had called East 16 the night he was arranging for Judy and myself to visit Lily Sanderson . New number , East i6 . That meant that there had been another number , an old one , and that Mary had known it . But it seemed to me that it meant much more ; that Mary had known some one in that house , possibly Florence Gunther herself . What that would explain I did not trouble to contemplate . It seemed to me that I must see Lily Sanderson again , see if she had met MaryTHE DOOR 153visit , and I did not urge her . It was after the tea had come and Clara had gone that she finally brought up the subject . " I do n't know whether it 's valuable or not , " she said . " But as a friend of Florence 's you ought to know . She was seen getting into a car , the night she was killed . Two people saw her . " " What kind of a car ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Did they notice the color ? " " They do n't agree about that . They 're the Italians who keep the fruit stand at the corner . I do n't know their names . We call him Tony . They knew Florence well ; she often bought apples there .. Tony says it was black , but Mrs. Tony says it was blue . " The story was as follows : on the night of Florence Gunther 's murder both the Italians at the fruit stand saw her coming along the street . She shook her head , to say she wanted nothing , and then waited for a street car . Both of them saw her distinctly . She seemed restless , walking a few steps each way , then back again . Before a car arrived , however , an automobile drew up before her ; a closed car with a man at the wheel . Owing to the fact that the street light was directly overhead , neither of the Italians saw him clearly , except that he wore a soft hat . There was some conversation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . They had known her for a long time , and she was always alone . She seemed to demur at something , the man appeared to insist . Finally he opened the door and she got in beside him . But  --  and here was the curious part  --  the woman at the fruit stand maintained that this same car had been standing halfway down the block in the shadow for some time . That she had seen it there , and that the man drivingit had been working at something about it ; front and rear . " She thought he was rubbing dirt over the license1 ( i9I , 152 THE DOORabout the house or with Florence , and that then we must find Mary herself . Find her and make her talk . When I called East i6 , however , Miss Sanderson was at work . And then that afternoon , as though she had caught my mental message , Lily Sanderson herself came to see me . It was fortunate that Joseph was taking his afternoon out , or he might not have admitted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people making social calls and people who came for purposes of their own . Indeed , I have seen him ; the swift glance at car or taxi- cab , the rapid appraisal , gloves , shoes , garments . And then the quick decision . " Madam is not at home . " Or a widening of the door , a bow ; taking the cards , rather in the grand manner , and through it all a sugges- tion  --  merely a suggestion  --  of welcome . But as it is Clara 's rule to admit all corners Lily San- derson gained access without trouble , and I found her in the drawing room , rather stiff and formal . " I hope you do n't mind my coming , " she said . " I just had a feeling I had to see you . " " I am glad you came . Would you like a cup of tea ? " " If it is n't too much trouble . I came from the store , and I 've had a hard day . I did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ watched with interest while I rang for Clara and ordered tea , and the long drawing room seemed to fasci- nate her . " Such a lovely place , " she said . " I was looking at your bushes , as I came in . And this room ! That 's a lovely cabinet over there . " " It is lovely , " I agreed . " It is very old . " And as I sat there looking at this big blue-eyed woman with her faint limp , her almost childlike assumption of sophistication , her queer clothes , I felt that I liked her . Liked her and trusted her . She did not come immediately to the reason for her154 THE DOORplates , " Miss Sanderson said . " And they had been held up a month or so before , so she watched him . She says now that he got into the car the moment he saw Florence . Then he drove up rather fast , and threw on the brakes in front of her , as though he had just seen her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and she went out and looked at the rear one . He had blacked it . She could n't read it , at all . " But that visit of Lily Sanderson 's was disappointing in one way at least . I asked her point blank if she knew a young woman named Mary Martin , and it produced no effect whatever . " Mary Martin ? " she said thoughtfully . " No , I ca n't say that I do . " " I think she knew Florence Gunther . If not , she certainlyknew some one at the house . " " I can ask , if you like , " she said . " I 've only been there since last fall , and most of the rest are new too . You know how it is , everything 's fine at first . Then you 're caught doing a bit of washing or having a gentleman friend more than one night a week , and there 's trouble . And that reminds me . I 've got something to tell you about the man who called @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clarissa ? " " The colored woman at the house . And a surly creature she is , at that . I gave her a dress the other day , and she talked . He was a thin man , rather tall ; she thinks about fifty . Well dressed , she says . He had a cane with him , and he wore a sport suit . Out our way that means some-thing ! " CHAPTER SIXTEENIT was that evening , Tuesday the seventeenth , at dinner , that I received one of Katherine 's characteristic terse telegrams . " Arriving tonight eleven o'clock train . " The telegram was not only unexpected but ominous . That Katherine , sunk in grief as she was , should leave her house and come to me at that time seemed almost incredible . I could think of only two things ; either that Jim had told her of the danger in which he stood , or that something had aroused her suspicions as to Howard 's death . In any event her coming was certainly significant , and I am not ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I left for the station . Nor did the sight of Katherinein her widow 's weeds , with that white cold face of hers set like a mask , improve matters . She offered me her cheek , and as I offered mine at the same moment , what resulted was rather like the nose rubbing of the Africans , or whoever it is . Not then , nor later when I showed her her room and the Frenchwoman , Elise , began to lay out her toilet things , did she offer any explanation of her visit . Judy , she said , was all right and would come with Jim the next morning . She herself had come on business . And then very politely she put me out and left me to lie awake most of the night , wondering . It was not until ten the next morning that I got my explanation , and then it was clear enough , and worrying enough , in all conscience . At ten o'clock the door bell rang , and it was Jim , accompanied by Judy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked odd and uncomfortable , but she was irrepressible , as always. 155156 THE DOOR THE DOOR 15- " It 's not a convention , " she said . " It 's merely a dele-gation . " She went upstairs to Katherine and the two men waited in the library , Jim moving about restlessly , Alex Davis glancing over some notes in his hand . In five minutes or so the bell rang again , and Joseph announced Mr. Waite . I was practically beyond speech by that time . I listened dumbly while Mr. Waite made his apologies ; he had just got off the train ; he had been taking the sun cure in Arizonafor his arthritis and was much better , thanks . Then his eyes fell on the black band on Jim 's sleeve , and he said something polite about Howard 's death . But it all seemed unreal to me , and when Joseph ushered in Doctor Simonds I was not surprised to see Alex Davis rise and clear his throat , as though he were about to address a meeting . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though he had announced that there was a quorum present . " And now , if Joseph will notify Mrs. Somers Bewildered as I was , I had to admire Katherine as she came in , in her long black gown and with her fine head high in the air . There was a superb dignity about her , a refusal to make any concessions to the expected , so unlike my own fluttering as to make me self-conscious . She shook hands with no one , smiled at no one . She simply sat down and looked at Alex Davis . " Very well , " she said . " I believe we are all ready . " And then Alex Davis did indeed make a speech . He referred to his late dear friend , Howard Somers , and to the grieving woman who sat there , finding herself in a position which it was difficult for her to accept . " In all their conversations together , this husband and this wife , she was led to believe that the bulk of his fortunewould come to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will she can not explain and does not accept . " I saw Mr. Waite frown slightly . " A will in which a wastrel son receives one half of this large estate . It is to discuss , not the validity of this will " he glanced atMr . Waite  --  " but the circumstances under which it was drawn , that she has asked you to meet her here today . " He sat down , and Mr. Waite took off his glasses and polished them with his handkerchief . " Am I to speak ? " he inquired . " I presume , since the integrity of the document is not in question , that it it really up to the doctor . " Urbane as he was , I saw that he was irritated . Under Alex 's fine words he must have seen , as I did , that it was the will itself which was under fire . " I actually know nothing , " the doctor said . " Walter Somers told me , during his father 's illness here last summer , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my opinion of his father 's mental condition , and I said I wished mine were as good . Later on he asked me to give him a note to that effect , and I did so . " He sat back , smoothing a small Van Dyke beard with a hand deeply stained from cigarettes . Katherine eyed hint and spoke for the first time . " You had given him no drugs , doctor ? " " Drugs ? " he said rather testily . " I gave him drugs , of course . That 's my profession . But I gave him nothingthat could by any stretch of the imagination affect his mind . " Mr. Waite 's story was given circumstantially and directly . On the twelfth of the previous August he had received a telephone call from Walter Somers , asking him to see his father that afternoon at the Imperial Hotel and to draw up a will for him . As he knew that Mr. Somers had been very ill and was still a sick man , he took the precautionof calling up the doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to his mental condition . Doctor Simonds said that he knew Mr. Somers was contemplating a new will , and that he was entirely competent to make one . The result was that he had drawn up the draft late that afternoon , and took back the finished document158 THE DOOR THE DOOR 159at something after four o'clock the next day . It was signed in duplicate . Katherine listened with slowly rising color . " Do you mean to say that you would draw up a will as vital as that , as  --  revolutionary , without question ? What about undue influence being brought to bear ? A man may appear to be normal , but after a severe illness , when he is weak and broken " There was certainly no influence evident at the time . The manager of the hotel took me up , and Walter Somers ' met me at the door and took me in . Then he went out and I did not see him again , either that day or the next . " " Was Sarah Gittings present ? " " She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went in , and she came in on the second day to witness the signatures . And I may add this . There was some discussionof the terms of the will . Mr. Somers himself knew that it was what you have called revolutionary , but he said that Walter had reached years of discretion , and that he felt that there was plenty for all . " " That is not the question , " said Katherine sharply . " The money 's nothing . What does money matter ? What does matter is that at the end he should have repudiated me . What brought that about , Mr. Waite ? What happened here last summer to change his entire attitude toward me ? Why did he put that will in his box , endorsedin his own hand to be given to my son Walter in the event of my death ? ' That is very serious , Mr. Waite . Had he ceased to trust me ? And that fund of fifty thousand dollars to be administered by Walter at his discretion ! What did he say about that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Walter understood . " " And that is all he said ? " " That is all . " She leaned back in her chair , apparently exhausted , and there was a short silence broken at last by Alex Davis " Have you the duplicate of the will with you , Mr. Waite ? " And then some of Mr. Waite 's air of offended dignity left him . He.stirred in his chair . " I was coming to that . As a matter of fact , a very strange thing has.happened to that copy , Mr. Davis . It has disappeared from our files . Mr. Henderson has been searching for several days , ever since Mr. Somers ' death , in fact . He has a theory as to its disappearance , but as it is not a pleasant one  --  " I happened to glance ' at Jim and his mouth was twitchingcrazily . " I think we must hear it , nevertheless . " " It 's like this . On the day of Sarah Gittings ' murder  --  that afternoon in fact  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's request , and left her there to secure certain documents . Later on she returned these papers , and he closed and locked the safe . She was a trusted employe , and everything apparently was all right . " When Mr. Somers died , however , in my absence Mr. Henderson , who knew about the will , went to the safe for the duplicate and found that it was gone . " No suspicion attached itself to Florence Gunther , who had herself gone with me on both days to the hotel and who had later witnessed the will . But during the interveningtime she had been murdered , and naturally everythingpertaining to her had become a matter of great interest . " Four days ago Mr. Henderson telegraphed me that the will was missing , and to come back . When he met me at the train this morning he told me that one of our clerks , a man named Lowrie , had remembered that on the afternoon of the day Sarah Gittings was killed he had seen Florence Gunther on the street ; that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , from the publishedphotographs , to have been Sarah Gittings , and there on the street pass to her a long envelope of the legal type . " If that is true , it is at least possible that the duplicate of the will was in that envelope . "
