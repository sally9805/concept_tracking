The Havana tourist hotels last week were forced to revise their room rates . Balcony suites went begging ; everyone wanted quiet inside rooms with no exposure . The precarious peace that has ruled Havana for the last six weeks ended with a prolonged and bloody explosion . <P> Last September Capt . Juan Blas Hernandez , a bowlegged old bushwhacker who fought Tyrant Machado for years and had started a lively little campaign against the Grau Government , suddenly appeared in Havana , publicly embracing not only President Grau but also swart " Emperor " Fulgencio Batista , the onetime Sergeant who led the Army 's revolt against its officers , and to the world 's surprise has maintained control of the Army ever since . <P> Last week unstable Hernandez struck again . In Atares Fortress , in the San Ambrosio and Dragones military posts , sections of the Army in sympathy with the ABC opposition rebelled in an effort to restore the brief conservative government of Carlos Manuel de Cespedes . Leading the Atares rebels was bowlegged old Hernandez , quickly joined by the men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in 1767 with walls of masonry over six feet thick , was reputedly proof against modern shell fire . <P> To the rebels ' dismay most of the Army and all the Navy stayed loyal to President Grau and Emperor Batista . Four field guns were unlimbered , trained on the fort . The first few shells were completely wild , either kicking up dirt harmlessly below the fort or shrieking off into Havana 's residential district thousands of yards beyond with most embarrassing results . But soon they dropped shell after shell into the fort . With cannon , anti-aircraft and machine guns the rebels replied , scored their greatest success by smashing a field gun on Burro Hill , mile and a half away , with two shots from a little one-pounder . <P> In Havana Harbor Cuba 's two cruisers Cuba and Patria , went into action hiding behind the Ward Liner Morro Castle for protection and popping shells over her smokestacks . Dozens of machine gun bullets splattered the liner 's deck , but miraculously no one was hit , not even a porthole smashed . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soldiers from the rooftops . Atares Fortress was a bloody shambles . In the midst of the siege a wild-eyed messenger burst into the Presidential palace shouting that Rebel Hernandez had been killed . It was true , and so had over 150 others . Atares surrendered . <P> The revolt died . Prominent Government partisans attempted to distract the populace by blaming the entire affair on U. S. Ambassador Sumner Welles , who like most foreign observers has been admittedly friendly to ex-President de Cespedes.
