Almost every school child knows the Audubon Societies , has given 10 to become a junior member and receive a button with a bird on it . The Audubon State Societies , founded in 1886 by Forest &; Stream ( monthly magazine ) , were united into a national organization 29 years ago by the late William Butcher , first president . Under his guidance until 1910 , the societies became the strongest , most respected conservation power in the U. S. Therefore when accusations and complaints were heard last week coming from members of the old bird-loving society itself , observers were surprised . The dissenters demanded that the organization have a thorough dusting and airing immediately . <P> The intrepid insurgents call themselves the Emergency Conservation Committee . Members are Mrs. Charles Noel Edge , Manhattan socialite ; Irving Brant of the St. Louis Star ; Henry Carey , Philadelphia lawyer ; Davis Quinn , Manhattan nature-lore writer . They prepared to make the meeting of the National Audubon Societies next week an explosive one by mailing to each director a copy of a pamphlet they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Explain ? In it , they charged that under the direction of President Thomas Gilbert Pearson , who succeeded the upright Butcher , the Society has been shamefully catering to wealthy sportsmen and potent gun companies . They assert that President Pearson has in the name of Audubon* opposed a bill in Congress to form permanent bird refuges , favored instead the establishment of interchangeable refuges , which would some years be public shooting grounds . Most biting criticism came in regard to Dr. Pearson 's Bulletin No. 6 which was circulated among members requesting them to oppose the 15-bird Federal limit on wild ducks which went into force this year . Dr. William Temple Hornaday , famed zoological member , supported the Emergency Conservation Committee , sent a letter to Mrs. Edge . " Ever since 1923 , " he wrote , " T. G. Pearson and a majority of the directors of the Audubon Society have been getting away with just the same as bird slaughter in supporting the organized and unorganized game-hogs of North America in their excessive killing privileges . " <P> Short , stout President Pearson @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1910 , shortly after he assumed virtual leadership , he accepted for the societies a $25,000 gift from Winchester Arms Co . Horrified bird lovers made him give it back . Since then subdued criticisms have been heard from time to time , occasional horrified ejaculations that a man with a gunner 's heart had crept into the Society , was perverting its policies . Last year a pamphlet signed by the late W. DeWitt Miller , vice president of the New Jersey Audubon Society , berated large bird societies for neglecting their duties . These charges , to which President Pearson turned an indifferent ear , are the direct cause of the present war . <P> *Barrel-chested John James Fougere Audubon ( 1785-1851 ) , for whom the National Audubon Societies were named , spent the prime of his life in difficult travel throughout the land shooting , skinning , studying , sketching , reporting North American birds . In 1827 he published his great ornithological work Birds of America containing 500 of his famed bird drawings .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
