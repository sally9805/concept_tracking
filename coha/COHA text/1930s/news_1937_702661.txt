Too late to take part in the battle , ten automobile loads of U. A. W. workers rolled into town just before 2 A. M. They were met at the center of town by a solid line of blue-uniformed Legionnaires , armed with rifles and baseball bats . The invading horde was halted . The men were hauled out of the cars and , after an exchange of words @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Detroit . All roads leading into Monroe were being guarded in similar fashion by Legionnaires and special deputies . Nine Taken to Hospital After the steel mill battle , the two hospitals here reported that they had received nine victims . Most of these were suffering from minor cuts and bruises . Ely Kirchot , a bystander , was overcome by gas , and Frank Pollzie , another onlooker , was cut by a brick hurled by a combatant . Joseph Gormish , a special deputy policeman , was overcome by gas from an unexploded bomb which the pickets tossed back to the police . William Navarre , a spectator , was treated for slight injuries . Conway , whose status in the mix-up was not immediately ascertained , was hit on the head with a club . All the others who were injured were on the picket line in front of the Newton Steel Company , a subsidiary of Republic Steel which alone , among the independents against whom the Steel Workers Organizing Committee is fighting , has tried to maintain operations . One of these was Mrs. Nina @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gas bomb while she was standing guard over a canvas soup kitchen for pickets , which the vigilantes , who followed in the wake of the special deputies , set afire . Andy Ornowsky , Andrew Marvine and H. R. Spence , all pickets , received minor injuries which required hospital treatment . The attack on the picket line by a force of deputies organized by Mayor Daniel A. Knaggs followed a plebiscite in which the employes of the Newton Steel Company , which employs 1,350 men , had voted overwhelmingly in favor of a return to work . It occurred just before dark after theopposing forces had faced each other for two hours or more while Governor Murphy , 100 miles away , made his attempt at a compromise . Discipline was maintained in the attacking force until the pickets had been scattered by the gas . Then the fleeing men were over , taken by groups of fifty or more vigilantes and in some cases badly beaten . This correspondent saw one man disarmed and ordered to i start running for Detroit .

Battle In Custer 's " Birthplace " The smashing of the picket line here , in the town where General Custer was born , was the first break in the dike which C. I. 0 . organizers have thrown around the steel mills of the independents in seven States , throwing some 70,000 men out of work . The attack was planned and carried out with military precision while Mayor Knaggs was in Lansing conferring with Governor Murphy , company and union officers . Toward midafternoon sound trucks rolled up and down the business streets calling members of the America ' Legion to report for strike duty . At the same time the deputies sworn in by the Mayor and Sheriff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and old clothes .

Riot sticks , slightly longer than a policeman 's club , were issued to each of the 200-odd men . A half dozen who had had military service in France were picked for the first rank . To four of these gas guns were issued . Dozens of tear and emetic gas shells were issued to other men beside and behind them . About 3 P. M. the column started down Elm Street , flanked by all the city 's police , whose patrol duties had been taken over by members of the American Legion . The deputies marched out past the bridge , a mile or so from the plant , where the workmen , waiting in cars for the picket line to be broken , honked and saluted . Along Elm Street the deputies marched as half the townfolk closed shops and scampered in droves to the scene of action . About 200 yards from the picket @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ along the river , in a near-by apple orchard and on the roofs of barns and houses , the pickets massed behind a rope barrier across the road . Women Gather Rocks for Missiles Edwin Mayberry , the picket captain , urged his men to hold the line at all costs and said that 4,000 loyal C. I. 0 . men were on their way from Toledo to attack the deputies from behind . The pickets cheered , lustily and waved their clubs . Women from the soup kitchen gathered rocks and piled them in convenient heaps for the men to throw . There followed nearly two hours of parleys between Chief Fisher , Mr. Mayberry , the Governor , union chiefs and the Mayor by telephone from Lansing . The Governor insisted that there be no bloodshed . Finally at 6 o'clock , while the pickets were still arguing among themselves about what they should do , Chief Fisher walked up to the picket line and announced that he would give them just two minutes to clear the road for the workmen sitting in their cars behind the deputies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all this stalling , " the police chief said , " in just exactly two minutes we 're coming through .
