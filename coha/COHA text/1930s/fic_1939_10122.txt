hard and had a maroon batik cover . The room felt cold . I locked it up again , wiped the knob off with my handkerchief , and went back to the totem pole . I knelt down and squinted along the nap of the rug to the front door . I thought I could see two parallel grooves pointing that way , as though heels had dragged . Whoever had done it had meant business . Dead men are heavier than broken hearts . It was n't the law . They would have been there still , just about getting warmed up with their pieces of string and chalk and their cameras and dusting powders and their nickel cigars . They would have been very much there . It was n't the killer . He had left too fast . He must have seen the girl . He could n't be sure she was too batty to see him . He would be on his way to distant places . I could n't guess the answer , but it was all right with me if somebody wanted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a chance to find out if I could tell it leaving Carmen Sternwood out . I locked up again , choked my car to life and rode off home to a shower , dry clothes and a late dinner . After that I sat around in the apartment and drank too much hot toddy trying to crack the code in Geiger 's blue indexed notebook . All I could be sure of was that it was a list of names and addresses , probably of the customers . There were over four hundred of them . That made it a nice racket , not to mentionany blackmail angles , and there were probably plenty of those . Any name on the list might be a pros/pect as the killer . I did n't envy the police their job when it was handed to them . I went to bed full of whiskey and frustration and dreamed about a man in a bloody Chinese coat who chased a naked girl with long jade earrings while I ran after them and tried to take a photograph with an empty camera . The next morning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a motorman 's glove in my mouth , drank two cups of coffee and went through the morning papers . I did n't find any reference to Mr. Arthur Gwynn Geiger in either of them . I was shaking the wrinkles out of my damp suit when the phone rang . It was Bernie Ohls , the D.A . ' s chief investigator , who had given me the lead to General Sternwood . " Well , how 's the boy ? " he began . He sounded like a man who had slept well and did n't owe too much money . " I 've got a hangover , " I said . " Tsk , tsk . " He laughed absently and then his voice became a shade too casual , a cagey cop voice . " Seen General Sternwood yet ? " " Uh-huh . "  | " Done anything for him ? " " Too much rain , " I answered , if that was an answer . " They seem to be a family things happen to . A big Buick belonging to one of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pier . " I held the telephone tight enough to crack it . I also held my breath . " Yeah , " Ohls said cheerfully . " A nice new Buick sedan all messed up with sand and sea water . . . . Oh , I almost forgot . There 's a guy inside it . " I let my breath out so slowly that it hung on my lip . " Regan ? " I asked . " Huh ? Who ? Oh , you mean the ex-legger the eldest girl picked up and went and married . I never saw him . What would he be doing down there ? " " Quit stalling . What would anybody be doing down there ? " " I do n't know , pal . I 'm dropping down to look see . Want to go along ? " " Yes . " " Snap it up , " he said . " I 'll be in my hutch . " Shaved , dressed and lightly breakfasted I was at the Hall of Justice in less than an hour . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the group of small offices used by the D.A . ' s men . Ohls ' was no larger than the others , but he had it to himself . There was nothing on his desk but a blotter , a cheap pen set , his hat and one of his feet . He was a medium-sized blondish man with stiffp53bite eyebrows , calm eyes and well-kept teeth . Helooked like anybody you would pass on the street . Ihappened to know he had killed nine men  --  three of them hen he was covered , or somebody thought he was . He stood up and pocketed a flat tin of toy cigars called niractes , jiggled the one in his mouth up and down and looked at me carefully along his nose , with his head thrown back . " It 's not Regan , " he said . " I checked . Regan 's a big guy , as tall as you and a shade heavier . This is a young kid . " I did n't say anything . " What made Regan skip out ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't think so , " I said . " When a guy out of the liquor traffic marries into a rich family and then waves good-by to a pretty dame and a couple million legitimate bucks  --  that 's enough to make even me think . I guess you thought that was a secret . " " Uh-huh . " " Okey , keep buttoned , kid . No hard feelings . " He came around the desk tapping his pockets and reaching for his hat . " I 'm not looking for Regan , " I said . He fixed the lock on his door and we went down to the official parking lot and got into a small blue sedan . We drove out Sunset , using the siren once in a while to beat a signal . It was a crisp morning , with just enough snap in the air to make life seem simple and sweet , if you did n't have too much on your mind . I had . It was thirty miles to Lido on the coast highway , the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in three quarters of an hour . At the end of that time we skidded to a stop in front of a faded stucco arch and I took my feet out of the floorboards and we got out . A long pier railed with white two-by-fours stretched seawardfrom the arch . A knot of people leaned out at the far end and a motorcycle officer stood under the arch keeping another group of people from going out on the pier . Cars were parked on both sides of the highway , the usual ghouls , of both sexes . Ohls showed the motorcycleofficer his badge and we went out on the pier , into a loud fish smell which one night 's hard rain had n't even dented . " There she is  --  on the power barge , " Ohls said , pointing with one of his toy cigars . A low black barge with a wheelhouse like a tug 's was crouched against the pilings at the end of the pier . Somethingthat glistened in the morning sunlight was on its deck , with hoist chains still around it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hoist had been swung back into position and lowered to deck level . Men stood around the car . We went down slippery steps to the deck . Ohls said hello to a deputy in green khaki and a manp55in plain clothes . The barge crew of three men leaned against the front of the wheelhouse and chewed tobacco . One of them was rubbing at his wet hair with a dirty bathtowel . That would be the man who had gone down into the water to put the chains on . We looked the car over . The front bumper was bent , one headlight smashed , the other bent up but the glass stiI1 unbroken . The radiator shell had a big dent in it , and the paint and nickel were scratched up all over the cur . The upholstery was sodden and black . None of the tires seemed to be damaged . The driver was still draped around the steering post with his head at an unnatural angle to his shoulders . He was a slim dark-haired kid who had been good-looking not so long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes were a faint dull gleam under the lowered lids and his open mouth had sand in it . On the left side of his forehead there was a dull bruise that stood out against the whiteness of the skin . Ohls backed away , made a noise in his throat and put a match to his little cigar . " What 's the story ? " The uniformed man pointed up at the rubbernecks on the end of the pier . One of them was fingering a place where the white two-by-fours had been broken through in a wide space . The splintered wood showed yellow and clean , like fresh-cut pine . " Went through there . Must have hit pretty hard . The ruin stopped early down here , around nine p.m . The broken wood 's dry inside . That puts it after the rain stopped . She fell in plenty of water not to be banged up worse , not more than half tide or she 'd have drifted farther , and not more than half tide going out or she 'd have crowded the piles @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nine-thirty , not earlier . She shows under the water when the boys come down to fish this morning , so we get the barge to hoist her out and we find the dead guy . " The plainclothesman scuffed at the deck with the toe of his shoe . Ohls looked sideways along his eyes at me , and twitched his little cigar like a cigarette . " Drunk ? " he asked , of nobody in particular . The man who had been toweling his head went over to the rail and cleared his throat in a loud hawk that made everybody look at him . " Got some sand , " he said , and spat . " Not as much as the boy friend got  --  but some . " The uniformed man said : " Could have been drunk . Showing off all alone in the rain . Drunks will do any-thing . " " Drunk , hell , " the plainclothesman said . " The hand throttle 's set halfway down and the guy 's been sapped on the side of the head . Ask @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at the man with the towel . " What do you think , buddy ? " The man with the towel looked flattered . He grinned . " I say suicide , Mac . None of my business , but you ask me , I say suicide . First off the guy plowed an awfulp57straight furrow down that pier . You can read his tread marks all the way nearly . That puts it after the rain like the Sheriff said . Then he hit the pier hard and clean or he do n't go through and land right side up . More likely turned over a couple of times . So he had plenty of speed and hit the rail square . That 's more than half-throttle . Ile could have done that with his hand falling and he could have hurt his head falling too . " Ohls said : " You got eyes , buddy . Frisked him ? " he asked the deputy . The deputy looked at me , then at the crew against the wheelhouse . " Okey , save that , " Ohls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face and a black bag came down the steps from the pier . He picked out a fairly clean spot on the deck and put the bag down . Then he took his hat off and rubbed the back of his neck and stared out to sea , as if he did n't know where he was or what he had come for . Ohls said : " There 's your customer , Doc . Dove off the pier last night . Around nine to ten . That 's all we know . " The small man looked in at the dead man morosely. 1 fe fingered the head , peered at the bruise on the temple , moved the head around with both hands , felt the man 's ribs . He lifted a lax dead hand and stared at the fingernails . He let it fall and watched it fall . He stepped back and opened his bag and took out a printed pad of D.O.A. forms and began to write over a carbon . " Broken neck 's the apparent cause of death , " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much water in him . Which means he 's due to start getting stiff pretty quick now he 's out in the air . Better get him out of the car before he does . You wo n't like doing it after . " Ohls nodded . " How long dead , Doc ? " " I would n't know . " Ohls looked at him sharply and took the little cigar out of his mouth and looked at that sharply . " Pleased to know you , Doc . A coroner 's man that ca n't guess within five minutes has me beat . " The little man grinned sourly and put his pad in his bag and clipped his pencil back on his vest . " If he ate dinner last night , I 'll tell you  --  if I know what time he ate it . But not within five minutes . " " How would he get that bruise  --  falling ? " The little man looked at the bruise again . " I do n't think so . That blow came from something covered . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Blackjack , huh ? " " Very likely . " The little M.E. 's man nodded , picked his bag off the deck and went back up the steps to the pier . An ambulancewas backing into position outside the stucco arch . Ohls looked at me and said : " Let 's go . Hardly worth the ride , was it ? " We went back along the pier and got into Ohls ' sedan again . He wrestled it around on the highway and drovep59back towards town along a three-lane highway washed clean by the rain , past low rolling hills of yellow-white sand terraced with pink moss . Seaward a few gulls wheeled and swooped over something in the surf and far out a white yacht looked as if it was hanging in the sky . Ohls cocked his chin at me and said : " Know him ? " " Sure . The Sternwood chauffeur . I saw him dusting that very car out there yesterday . " " I do n't want to crowd you , Marlowe . Just tell me , did the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No . I do n't even know his name . " " Owen Taylor . How do I know ? Funny about that . About a year or so back we had him in the cooler on a Mann Act rap . It seems he run Sternwood 's hotcha ( laughter , the young one , off to Yuma . The sister ran a f to them and brought them back and had Owen heaved into the icebox . Then next day she comes down to the D.A . and gets him to beg the kid off with the U.S. ' cutor . She says the kid meant to marry her sister and wanted to , only the sister ca n't see it . All she wanted was to kick a few high ones off the bar and have herself a party . So we let the kid go and then darned if they do n't have him come back to work . And a little later we get the routine report on his prints from Washington , and he 's got a prior back in Indiana , attempted hold-up six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the county jail , the very one Dillinger bust out of . We hand that to the Sternwoodsand they keep him on just the same . What do you think of that ? " " They seem to be a screwy family , " I said . " Do they know about last night ? " " No . I got ta go up against them now . " " Leave the old man out of it , if you can . " " Why ? "  --  " He has enough troubles and he 's sick . " " You mean Regan ? " I scowled . " I do n't know anything about Regan , I told you . I 'm not looking for Regan . Regan has n't bothered anybody that I know of . " Ohis said : " Oh , " and stared thoughtfully out to sea and the sedan nearly went off the road . For the rest of the drive back to town he hardly spoke . He dropped me off in Hollywood near the Chinese Theater and turned back west to Alta @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at an afternoon paper and could n't find anything about Geiger in it . After lunch I walked east on the boulevard to have another look at Geiger 's store. the big sleep 61p61The lean black-eyed credit jeweler was standing in his entrance in the same position as the afternoon before . 1 le gave me the same knowing look as I turned in . The store looked just the same . The same lamp glowed on the small desk in the corner and the same ash blonde in the same black suede-like dress got up from behind it and came towards me with the same tentative smile on her face . " Was it  --  ? " she said and stopped . Her silver nails twitched at her side . There was an overtone of strain in her smile . It was n't a smile at all . It was a grimace . She just thought it was a smile . " Back again , " I chirped airily , and waved a cigarette . " Mr. Geiger in today ? " " I 'm  --  I 'm afraid not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see  --  you wanted . . . ? " I took my dark glasses off and tapped them delicately on the inside of my left wrist . If you can weigh a hundred and ninety pounds and look like a fairy , I was doingmy best . " That was just a stall about those first editions , " I whispered . " I have to be careful . I 've got something he 'll want . Something he 's wanted for a long time . " The silver fingernails touched the blond hair over one small jet-buttoned ear . " Oh , a salesman , " she said . " Well  --  you might come in tomorrow . I think he 'll be here tomorrow . " " Drop the veil , " I said . " I 'm in the business too . " Her eyes narrowed until they were a faint greenish glitter , like a forest pool far back in the shadow of trees . Her fingers clawed at her palm . She stared at me and chopped off a breath . " Is he sick ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impatiently . " I have n't got forever . " " You  --  a  --  you  --  a  --  " her throat jammed . I thought she was going to fall on her nose . Her whole body shivered and her face fell apart like a bride 's pie crust . She put it together again slowly , as if lifting a great weight , by sheer will power . The smile came back , with a couple of corners badly bent . " No , " she breathed . " No . He 's out of town . That  --  would n't be any use . Ca n't you  --  come in  --  tomor-row ? " I had my mouth open to say something when the partitiondoor opened a foot . The tall dark handsome boy in the jerkin looked out , pale-faced and tight-lipped , saw me , shut the door quickly again , but not before I had seen on the floor behind him a lot of wooden boxes lined with newspapers and packed loosely with books . A man in very new overalls was fussing with them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When the door shut I put my dark glasses on again and touched my hat . " Tomorrow , then . I 'd like to give you a card , but you know how it is . " " Ye-es . I know how it is . " She shivered a little more and made a faint sucking noise between her bright lips . I went out of the store and west on the boulevard to the corner and north on the street to the alley which ran behind the stores . A small black truck with wire sides and no lettering on it was backed up to Geiger 's place . The man in the very new overalls was just heaving a box up on the tailboard . I went back to the boulevard and along the block next to Geiger 's and found a taxi standing at a fireplug . A fresh-faced kid was reading a horror magazinebehind the wheel . I leaned in and showed him a dollar : " Tail job ? " He looked me over . " Cop ? " " Private . " He grinned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the magazineover his rear view mirror and I got into the cab . We went around the block and pulled up across from Geiger 's alley , beside another fireplug . There were about a dozen boxes on the truck when the man in overalls closed the screened doors and hooked the tailboard up and got in behind the wheel . " Take him , " I told my driver . The man in overalls gunned his motor , shot a glance up and down the alley and ran away fast in the other direction . He turned left out of the alley . We did the same . I caught a glimpse of the truck turning east on Franklin and told my driver to close in a little . He did n't or could n't do it . I saw the truck two blocks away when we got to Franklin . We had it in sight to Vine and across Vine and all the way to Western . We saw it twice after Western . There was a lot of traffic and the fresh-faced kid tailed from too far back @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when the truck , now far ahead , turned north again . The street at which it turned was called Brittany Place . When we got to Brittany Place the truck had vanished . The fresh-faced kid made comforting sounds at me through the panel and we went up the hill at four miles an hour looking for the truck behind bushes . Two blocks up , Brittany Place swung to the east and met Randall Place in a tongue of land on which there was a white apartment house with its front on Randall Place and its basement garage opening on Brittany . We were going past that and the fresh-faced kid was telling me the truck could n't be far away when I looked through the arched entrance of the garage and saw it back in the dimness with its rear doors open again . We went around to the front of the apartment house and I got out . There was nobody in the lobby , no switchboard . A wooden desk was pushed back against the wall beside a panel of gilt mailboxes . I looked the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 405.  |p65A  man named Joe Brody had received five thousand dollarsfrom General Sternwood to stop playing with Carmenand find some other little girl to play with . It could be the same Joe Brody . I felt like giving odds on it . I went around an elbow of wall to the foot of tiled stairs and the shaft of the automatic elevator . The top o f the elevator was level with the floor . There was a door beside the shaft lettered " Garage . " I opened it and went down narrow steps to the basement . The automatic elevator was propped open and the man in new overalls was grunting hard as he stacked heavy boxes in it . I stood beside him and lit a cigarette and watched him . Ile did n't like my watching him . After a while I said : " Watch the weight , bud . She'sonly tested for half a ton . Where 's the stuff going ? " " Brody , four-o-five , " he grunted . " Manager ? " " Yeah . Looks like a nice lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white rimmed eyes . " Books , " he snarled . " A hundred pounds a box , easy , and me with a seventy-five pound back . " " Well , watch the weight , " I said . He got into the elevator with six boxes and shut the doors . I went back up the steps to the lobby and out to the street and the cab took me downtown again to my officebuilding . I gave the fresh-faced kid too much money and he gave me a dog-eared business card which for once I did n't drop into the majolica jar of sand beside the elevator bank.  | I had a room and a half on the seventh floor at the back . The half room was an office split in two to make reception rooms . Mine had my name on it and nothing else , and that only on the reception room . I always left this unlocked , in case I had a client , and the client cared to sit down and wait . I had a client . She wore brownish speckled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoes . Her stockings were just as sheer as the day before , but she was n't showing as much of her legs . Her black hair was glossy under a brown Robin Hood hat that might have cost fifty dollars and looked as if you could have made it with one hand out of a desk blotter . " Well , you do get up , " she said , wrinkling her noseat the faded red settee , the two odd semi-easy chairs , thenet curtains that needed laundering and the boy 's sizelibrary table with the venerable magazines on it to givethe place a professional touch . " I was beginning tothink perhaps you worked in bed , like Marcel Proust . " " Who 's he ? " I put a cigarette in my mouth and staredip67at her . She looked a little pale and strained , but she looked like a girl who could function under a strain . " A French writer , a connoisseur in degenerates . You would n't know him . " " Tut , tut , " I said . " Come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " We did n't get along very well yesterday . Perhaps I was rude . " " We were both rude , " I said . I unlocked the communicatingdoor and held it for her . We went into the rest of my suite , which contained a rust-red carpet , not very young , five green filing cases , three of them full of ( : alifornia climate , an advertising calendar showing the Quints rolling around on a sky-blue floor , in pink dresses , with seal-brown hair and sharp black eyes as Dirge as mammoth prunes . There were three near-walnutchairs , the usual desk with the usual blotter , pen set , ashtray and telephone , and the usual squeaky swivel chair behind it . " You do n't put on much of a front , " she said , sitting down at the customer 's side of the desk . I went over to the mail slot and picked up six envelopes , two letters and four pieces of advertising matter . I hung my hat on the telephone and sat down . " Neither @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't make much money at this trade , if you 're honest . If you have a front , you 're making money  --  or expect to . " " Oh  --  are you honest ? " she asked and opened her bag . She picked a cigarette out of a French enamel case , lit it with a pocket lighter , dropped case and lighter bark into the bag and left the bag open . " Painfully . " " How did you ever get into this slimy kind of business then ? " " How did you come to marry a bootlegger ? " " My God , let 's not start quarreling again . I 've been trying to get you on the phone all morning . Here and at your apartment . " " About Owen ? " Her face tightened sharply . Her voice was soft . " Poor Owen , " she said . " So you know about that . " " A D.A . ' s man took me down to Lido . He thought I might know something about it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew Owen wanted to marry your sister  --  once . " She puffed silently at her cigarette and considered me with steady black eyes . " Perhaps it would n't have been a bad idea , " she said quietly . " He was in love with her . We do n't find much of that in our circle . " " He had a police record . " She shrugged . She said negligently : " He did n't know the right people . That 's all a police record means in this rotten crime-ridden country . " " I would n't go that far . " She peeled her right glove off and bit her index finger at the first joint , looking at me with steady eyes . " Ip69did n't come to see you about Owen . Do you feel yet that you can tell me what my father wanted to see you about ? " " Not without his permission . " " Was it about Carmen ? " " I ca n't even say that . " I finished filling a pipe and pint a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment . 1 ' 11 ( . n her hand went into her open bag and come out with at thick white envelope . She tossed it across the desk . " You 'd better look at it anyway , " she said . I picked it up . The address was typewritten to Mrs. Vivian Regan , 3765 Alta Brea Crescent , West Hollywood . Delivery had been by messenger service and the office stamp showed 8.35 a.m. as the time out . I opened the envelope and drew out the shiny 41/4 by 31/4 photo that was all there was inside . It was Carmen sitting in Geiger 's high-backed teakwoodchair on the dais , in her earrings and her birthday suit . Her eyes looked even a little crazier than as I rememberedthem . The back of the photo was blank . I put it back in the envelope . " How much do they want ? " I asked . " Five thousand  --  for the negative and the rest of the prints . The deal has to be closed tonight , or they give the stuff @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how ? " " A woman telephoned me , about half an hour after this thing was delivered . "  | " There 's nothing in the scandal sheet angle . Juries convict without leaving the box on that stuff nowadays . What else is there ? " " Does there have to be something else ? " " Yes . " She stared at me , a little puzzled . " There is . The woman said there was a police jam connected with it and I 'd better lay it on the line fast , or I 'd be talking to my little sister through a wire screen . " " Better , " I said . " What kind of jam ? " " I do n't know . " " Where is Carmen now ? " " She 's at home . She was sick last night . She 's still in bed , I think . " " Did she go out last night ? " " No . I was out , but the servants say she was n't . I was down at Las @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I lost my shirt . " " So you like roulette . You would . " She crossed her legs and lit another cigarette . " Yes . I like roulette . All the Sternwoods like losing games , like roulette and marrying men that walk out on them and riding steeplechases at fifty-eight years old and beingrolled on by a jumper and crippled for life . The Sternwoods have money . All it has bought them is a rain check . " " What was Owen doing last night with your car ? " " Nobody knows . He took it without permission . Wep71always let him take a car on his night off , but last night was n't his night off . " She made a wry mouth . " Do you think  --  ? " " He knew about this nude photo ?

I could probablyborrow it from Eddie @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows . " " Better try that . You may need it in a hurry . " She leaned back and hung an arm over the back of the chair . " How about telling the police ? " " It 's a good idea . But you wo n't do it . " " Wo n't I ? " " No . You have to protect your father and your sister . You do n't know what the police might turn up . It might be something they could n't sit on . Though they usually try in blackmail cases . " " Can you do anything ? " " I think I can . But I ca n't tell you why or how . " " I like you , " she said suddenly . " You believe in miracles . Would you have a drink in the office ?

She stared tightly at me and added : " That does n't interest you ? " " It ought to make it easier to find him  --  if I was looking for him . You do n't think he 's in this mess , do you ? " She pushed her empty glass at me . " Give me another drink . You 're the hardest guy to get anything out of . You do n't even move your ears . " I filled the little glass .

" I 'll keep in touch with you , " I said . " If you want to leave me a message , the phone girl at my apartment house will take care of it . " We walked over to the door . Tapping the white envelopeagainst her knuckles , she said : " You still feel you ca n't tell me what Dad  --  "  | " I 'd have to see him first .

Or can I call you Phil ? " " Sure . " " You can call me Vivian . " " Thanks , Mrs. Regan . " " Oh , go to hell , Marlowe . " She went on out and did n't look back . I let the door shut and stood with my hand on it , staring at the hand . My face felt a little hot . I went back to the desk and put the whiskey away and rinsed out the two pony glasses and put them away . I took my hat off the phone and called the D. A. 's office and asked for Bernie Ohls . He was back in his cubbyhole . " Well , I let the old man alone , " he said . " The butler said he or one of the girls would tell him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went through his stuff .

I know a lad on one of the tables . " " You ought to stop some of that flash gambling , " I said . " With the syndicate we got in this county ? Be your age , Marlowe . That sap mark on the boy 's head bothers me . Sure you ca n't help me on this ? " I liked his putting it that way . It let me say no withoutactually lying . We said good-by and I left the office , bought all three afternoon papers and rode a taxi down to the Hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lot . There was nothing in any of the papers about Geiger . I took another look at his blue notebook , but the code was just as stubborn as it had been the night before . The trees on the upper side of Laverne Terrace had fresh green leaves after the rain . In the cool afternoon sunlightI could see the steep drop of the hill and the flightp75of steps down which the killer had run after his three shots in the darkness . Two small houses fronted on the street below . They might or might not have heard the shots . There was no activity in front of Geiger 's house or anywhere along the block . The box hedge looked green and peaceful and the shingles on the roof were still damp . I drove past slowly , gnawing at an idea . I had n't looked in the garage the night before . Once Geiger 's body slipped away I had n't really wanted to find it . It would force my hand . But dragging him to the garage , to his own car and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ canyons around Los Angeles would be a good way to dispose of him for days or even for weeks . That supposed two things : a key to his car and two in the party . It would narrow the sector of search quite a lot , especially as I had had his personal keys in my pocket when it happened . I did n't get a chance to look at the garage . The doors were shut and padlocked and something moved behind the hedge as I drew level . A woman in a green and white check coat and a small button of a hat on soft blond hair stepped out of the maze and stood looking wild-eyed at my car , as if she had n't heard it come up the hill . Then she turned swiftly and dodged back out of sight . It was Carmen Sternwood , of course . I went on up the street and parked and walked back . In the daylight it seemed an exposed and dangerous thing to do . I went in through the hedge . She stood there straight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly up to her teeth and her teeth bit at her funny thumb . There were purple smears under her eyes and her face was gnawed white by nerves . She half smiled at me . She said : " Hello , " in a thin , brittle voice . " Wha  --  what  --  ? " That tailed off and she went back to the thumb . " Remember me ? " I said . " Doghouse Reilly , the man that grew too tall . Remember ? " She nodded and a quick jerky smile played across her face . " Let 's go in , " I said . " I 've got a key . Swell , huh ? " " Wha  --  wha  --  ? " I pushed her to one side and put the key in the door and opened it and pushed her in through it . I shut the door again and stood there sniffing . The place was horribleby daylight . The Chinese junk on the walls , the rug , the fussy lamps , the teakwood stuff , the sticky riot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ether and laudanum  --  allthis in the daytime had a stealthy nastiness , like a fag party . The girl and I stood looking at each other . She tried to keep a cute little smile on her face but her face was too tired to be bothered . It kept going blank on her . The smile would wash off like water off sand and her pale skin had a harsh granular texture under the stunned and stupid blankness of her eyes . A whitish tongue lickedp77at the corners of her mouth . A pretty , spoiled and not very bright little girl who had gone very , very wrong , and nobody was doing anything about it . To hell with the rich . They made me sick . I rolled a cigarette in my lingers and pushed some books out of the way and sat on the end of the black desk . I lit my cigarette , puffed a plume of smoke and watched the thumb and tooth act for a while in silence . Carmen stood in front of me , like a bad girl in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here ? " I asked her finally . She picked at the cloth of her coat and did n't answer . " How much do you remember of last night ? " She answered that  --  with a foxy glitter rising at theback of her eyes . " Remember what ? I was sick lastnight . I was home . " Her voice was a cautious throatysound that just reached my ears . " Like hell you were . " 1 Ter eyes flicked up and down very swiftly . " Before you went home , " I said . " Before I took you home . Here . In that chair  --  " I pointed to it  --  " on that orange shawl . You remember all right . " A slow flush crept up her throat . That was something . She could blush . A glint of white showed under the clogged gray irises . She chewed hard on her thumb . " You  --  were the one ? " she breathed . " Me . How much of it stays with you ? " She said vaguely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a friend of your father's. "  | " You 're not the police ? " " No . " She let out a thin sigh . " Wha  --  what do you want ? " " Who killed him ? " Her shoulders jerked , but nothing more moved in her face . " Who else  --  knows ? " " About Geiger ? I do n't know . Not the police , or they 'd be camping here . Maybe Joe Brody . " It was a stab in the dark but it got a yelp out of her . " Joe Brody ! Him ! " Then we were both silent . I dragged at my cigarette and she ate her thumb . " Do n't get clever , for God 's sake , " I urged her . " This is a spot for a little old-fashioned simplicity . Did Brody kill him ? " " Kill who ? " " Oh , Christ , " I said . She looked hurt . Her chin came down an inch . " Yes , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Why ? " " I do n't know . " She shook her head , persuading herself that she did n't know . " Seen much of him lately ? " Her hands went down and made small white knots . " Just once or twice . I hate him . " " Then you know where he lives . " " Yes . " " And you do n't like him any more ? "  | " I hate him ! " " Then you 'd like him for the spot . " A little blank again . I was going too fast for her . It was hard not to . " Are you willing to tell the police it was Joe Brody ? " I probed . Sudden panic flamed all over her face . " If I can kill the nude photo angle , of course , " I added soothingly . She giggled . That gave me a nasty feeling . If she had screeched or wept or even nosedived to the floor in a ( lead faint , that would have been all right . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She had had her photo taken as Isis and somebody had swiped it and somebody had bumped Geiger off in front of her and she was drunker than a Legion convention , and it was suddenly a lot of nice clean fun . So she giggled . Very cute . The giggles got louder and ran around the corners of the room like rats behind the wainscoting . She started to go hysterical . I slid off the desk and stepped up close to her and gave her a smack on the side of the face . " Just like last night , " I said . " We 're a scream together . Reilly and Sternwood , two stooges in search of a comedian . " The giggles stopped dead , but she did n't mind the slap any more than last night . Probably all her boy friends got around to slapping her sooner or later . I could understand how they might . I sat down on the end of the black desk again . " Your name is n't Reilly , " she said seriously . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Viv told me . She showed me your card . " She smoothed the cheek I had slapped . She smiled at me , as if I was nice to be with . " Well , you do remember , " I said . " And you came back to look for that photo and you could n't get into the house . Did n't you ? " Her chin ducked down and up . She worked the smile . I was having the eye put on me . I was being brought into camp . I was going to yell " Yippee ! " in a minute and ask her to go to Yuma . " The photo 's gone , " I said . " I looked last night , before I took you home . Probably Brody took it with him . You 're not kidding me about Brody ? " She shook her head earnestly . " It 's a pushover , " I said . " You do n't have to give it another thought . Do n't tell a soul you were here , last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you were here . Leave it to Reilly . " " Your name is n't  --  " she began , and then stopped and shook her head vigorously in agreement with what I had said or with what she had just thought of . Her eyes became narrow and almost black and as shallow as enamel on a cafeteria tray . She had had an idea . " I have to go home now , " she said , as if , we had been having a cup of tea . " Sure . " I did n't move . She gave me another cute glance andp81went on towards the front door . She had her hand on the knob when we both heard a car coming . She looked at me with questions in her eyes . I shrugged . The car stopped , right in front of the house . Terror twisted her face . There were steps and the bell rang . Carmen stared back at me over her shoulder , her hand clutching the door knob , almost drooling with fear . The bell kept on ringing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and Carmen jumped away from it and stood frozen . The door swung open . A man stepped through it briskly and stopped dead , staring at us quietly , with complete composure . He was a gray man , all gray , except for his polished black shoes and two scarlet diamonds in his gray satin tie that looked like the diamonds on roulette layouts . His shirt was gray and his double-breasted suit of soft , beautifully cut flannel . Seeing Carmen he took a gray hat off and his hair underneath it was gray and as fine as if it had been sifted through gauze . His thick gray eyebrows had that indefinably sporty look . He had a long chin , a nose with a hook to it , thoughtful gray eyes that had a slanted look because the fold of skin over his upper lid came down over the corner of the lid itself . He stood there politely , one hand touching the door at his back , the other holding the gray hat and flapping it gently against his thigh . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ More like the hardness of a wellweatheredhorseman . But he was no horseman . He was Eddie Mars . He pushed the door shut behind him and put that hand in the lap-seamed pocket of his coat and left the thumb outside to glisten in the rather dim light of the room . He smiled at Carmen . He had a nice easy smile . She licked her lips and stared at him . The fear went out of her face . She smiled back . " Excuse the casual entrance , " he said . " The bell did n't seem to rouse anybody . Is Mr. Geiger around ? " I said : " No . We do n't know just where he is . We found the door a little open . We stepped inside . " He nodded and touched his long chin with the brim of his hat . " You 're friends of his , of course ? " " Just business acquaintances . We dropped by for a book . " " A book , eh ? " He said that quickly and brightly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he knew all about Geiger 's books . Then he looked at Carmen again and shrugged . I moved towards the door . " We 'll trot along now , " I said . I took hold of her arm . She was staring at Eddie Mars . She liked him.  | " Any message  --  if Geiger comes back ? " Eddie Mars asked gently . " We wo n't bother you . " " ' That 's too bad , " he said , with too much meaning . His gray eyes twinkled and then hardened as I went past him to open the door . He added in a casual tone : " The girl can dust . I 'd like to talk to you a little , soldier . " I let go of her arm . I gave him a blank stare . " Kidder , eh ? " he said nicely . " Do n't waste it . I 've got two hays outside in a car that always do just what I want there to . " Carmen made a sound at my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rapidly downhill . I had n't Peen her car , so she must have left it down below . I started to say : " What the hell  --  ! " " Oh , skip it , " Eddie Mars sighed . " There 's something wrong around here . I 'm going to find out what it is .. If you want to pick lead out of your belly , get in my way . " " Well , well , " I said , " a tough guy . " " Only when necessary , soldier . " He was n't looking at me any more . He was walking around the room , frowning , not paying any attention to me . I looked out above the broken pane of the front window . The top of a car showed over the hedge . Its motor idled . Eddie Mars found the purple flagon and the two goldveinedglasses on the desk . He sniffed at one of thep84glasses , then at the flagon . A disgusted smile wrinkled his lips . " The lousy pimp , " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grunted , went on around the desk and stood in front of the little totem pole with the camera eye . He studied it , dropped his glance to the floor in front of it . He moved the small rug with his foot , then bent swiftly , his body tense . He went down on the floor with one gray knee . The desk hid him from me partly . There was a sharp exclamation and he came up again . His arm flashed under his coat and a black Luger appeared in his hand . He held it in long brown fingers , not pointing it at me , not pointing it at anything . " Blood , " he said . " Blood on the floor there , under the rug . Quite a lot of blood . " " Is that so ? " I said , looking interested . He slid into the chair behind the desk and hooked the mulberry-colored phone towards him and shifted the Luger to his left hand . He frowned sharply at the telephone , bringing his thick gray eyebrows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skin at the top of his hooked nose . " I think we 'll have some law , " he said . I went over and kicked at the rug that lay where Geiger had lain . " It 's old blood , " I said . " Dried blood . " " Just the same we 'll have some law . " " Why not ? " I said.  |p85I  I is eyes went narrow . The veneer had flaked off him , leaving a well-dressed hard boy with a Luger . He did n't like my agreeing with him . " Just who the hell are you , soldier ? " " Marlowe is the name . I 'm a sleuth . " " Never heard of you . Who 's the girl ? " " Client . Geiger was trying to throw a loop on her w i t ii some blackmail . We came to talk it over . He was n't here . The door being open we walked in to wait . Or id I tell you that ? " " Convenient , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't have a key . " " Yes . How come you had a key ? " " Is that any of your business , soldier ? " " I could make it my business . " lie smiled tightly and pushed his hat back on his grayhair . " And I could make your business my business . " " You would n't like it . The pay 's too small . " " All right , bright eyes . I own this house . Geiger is y tenant . Now what do you think of that ? " " You know such lovely people . " " I take them as they come . They come all kinds . " He glanced down at the Luger , shrugged and tucked it back wider his arm . " Got any good ideas , soldier ? " " Lots of them . Somebody gunned Geiger . Somebody got gunned by Geiger , who ran away . Or it was two other fellows . Or Geiger was running a cult and made blood sacrifices in front of that totem pole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his chickens in the front parlor . " The gray man scowled at me . " I give up , " I said . " Better call your friends down-town . " " I do n't get it , " he snapped . " I do n't get your game here . " " Go ahead , call the buttons . You 'll get a big reaction from it . " He thought that over without moving . His lips went back against his teeth . " I do n't get that , either , " he said tightly . " Maybe it just is n't your day . I know you , Mr. Mars . The Cypress Club at Las Olindas . Flash gambling for flash people . The local law in your pocket and a wellgreasedline into L.A. In other words , protection . Geigerwas in a racket that needed that too . Perhaps you spared him a little now and then , seeing he 's your ten-ant . " His mouth became a hard white grimace . " Geiger was in what racket ? " " The smut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long level minute . " Somebody got to him , " he said softly . " You know something about it . He did n't show at the store today . They do n't know where he is . He did n't answer the phone here . I came up to see about it . I find blood on the floor , under a rug . And you and a girl here . "  | " A little weak , " I said . " But maybe you can sell the story to a willing buyer . You missed a little something , though . Somebody moved his books out of the store today  --  thenice books he rented out . " He snapped his fingers sharply and said : " I should hive thought of that , soldier . You seem to get around . How do you figure it ? " " I think Geiger was rubbed . I think that is his blood . Arid the books being moved out gives a motive for hiding the body for a while . Somebody is taking over the racket and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ca n't get away with it , " Eddie Mars said grimly . " Who says so ? You and a couple of gunmen in your r outside ? This is a big town now , Eddie . Some very ugh people have checked in here lately . The penalty f growth . " " You talk too damned much , " Eddie Mars said . He bared his teeth and whistled twice , sharply . A car doorslammed outside and running steps came through thehedge . Mars flicked the Luger out again and pointed it It my chest . " Open the door . " The knob rattled and a voice called out . I did n't move . The muzzle of the Luger looked like the mouth of the Second Street tunnel , but I did n't move . Not bebigbullet proof is an idea I had had to get used to . " Open it yourself , Eddie . Who the hell are you to jive me orders ? Be nice and I might help you out . "  | He came to his feet rigidly and moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ door . He opened it without taking his eyes off me . Two men tumbled into the room , reaching busily under their arms . One was an obvious pug , a good-looking pale-faced boy with a bad nose and one ear like a club steak . The other man was slim , blond , deadpan , with close-set eyes and no color in them . Eddie Mars said : " See if this bird is wearing any iron . " The blond flicked a short-barreled gun out and stood pointing it at me . The pug sidled over flatfooted and felt my pockets with care . I turned around for him like a bored beauty modeling an evening gown . " No gun , " he said in a burry voice . " Find out who he is . " The pug slipped a hand into my breast pocket and drew out my wallet . He flipped it open and studied the contents . " Name 's Philip Marlowe , Eddie . Lives at the Hobart Arms on Franklin . Private license , deputy 's badge and all . A shamus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , slapped my face lightly and turned away . " Beat it , " Eddie Mars said . The two gunmen went out again and closed the door . There was the sound of them getting back into the car . They started its motor and kept it idling once more . " All right . Talk , " Eddie Mars snapped . The peaks of his eyebrows made sharp angles against his forehead.  | " I 'm not ready to give out . Killing Geiger to grab his racket would be a dumb trick and I 'm not sure it happened that way , assuming he has been killed . But I 'm sure that whoever got the books knows what 's what , and I 'm sure that the blonde lady down at his store is scared batty about something or other . And I have aess who got the books . " " Who ? " " That 's the part I 'm not ready to give out . I 've got a client , you know . " He wrinkled his nose . " That  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would know the girl , " I said . " Who got the books , soldier ? " " Not ready to talk , Eddie . Why should I ? " Ile put the Luger down on the desk and slapped itwith his open palm . " This , " he said . " And I might puke it worth your while . " " That 's the spirit . Leave the gun out of it . I can always hear the sound of money . How much are you clinking at me ? " " For doing what ? " " What did you want done ? " f le slammed the desk hard . " Listen , soldier . I ask on a question and you ask me another . We 're not getnganywhere . I want to know where Geiger is , for my Own personal reasons . I did n't like his racket and I did n't protect him . I happen to own this house . I 'm not so crazy about that right now . I can believe that whatever you know about all this is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ johns squeaking sole leather around this dump . You have n't got anything to sell . My guess is you need a little protection yourself . So cough up . " It was a good guess , but I was n't going to let him know it . I lit a cigarette and blew the match out and flicked it at the glass eye of the totem pole . " You 're right , " I said . " If anything has happened to Geiger , I 'll have to give what I have to the law . Which puts it in the public domain and does n't leave me anything to sell . So with your permission I 'll just drift . " His face whitened under the tan . He looked mean , fast and tough for a moment . He made a movement to lift the gun . I added casually : " By the way , how is Mrs. Mars these days ? " I thought for a moment I had kidded him a little too far . His hand jerked at the gun , shaking . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Beat it , " he said quite softly . " I do n't give a damn where you go or what you do when you get there . Only take a word of advice , soldier . Leave me out of your plans or you 'll wish your name was Murphy and you lived in Limerick . " " Well , that 's not so far from Clonmel , " I said . " I hear you had a pal came from there . " He leaned down on the desk , frozen-eyed , unmoving . I went over to the door and opened it and looked back at him . His eyes had followed me , but his lean gray bodyp91had not moved . There was hate in his eyes . I went out and through the hedge and up the hill to my car and got into it . I turned it around and drove up over the crest . Nobody shot at me . After a few blocks I turned off , cut the motor and sat for a few moments . Nobody followed inc either . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ five when I parked near the lobby entrance of the apartment house on Randall Place . A few windows were lit and radios were bleating at the dusk . I rode the automatic elevator up to the fourth floor and went along a wide hall carpeted in green and paneled in ivory . A cool breeze blew down the hall from the open screened door to the fire escape . There was a small ivory pushbutton beside the door marked " 405 . " I pushed it and waited what seemed a long time . Then the door opened noiselessly about a foot . There was a steady , furtive air in the way it opened . The man was long-legged , long-waisted , highshoulderedand he had dark brown eyes in a brown expressionlessface that had learned to control its expressionslong ago . Hair like steel wool grew far back on his head and gave him a great deal of domed brown forehead that might at a careless glance have seemed a dwelling place for brains . His somber eyes probed at me impersonally . His long thin brown fingers held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said : " Geiger ? " Nothing in the man 's face changed that I could see . He brought a cigarette from behind the door and tucked it between his lips and drew a little smoke from it . The smoke came towards me in a lazy , contemptuous puff and behind it words in a cool , unhurried voice that had no more inflection than the voice of a faro dealer . " You said what ? " " Geiger . Arthur Gwynn Geiger . The guy that has the books . " The man considered that without any haste . He glanced down at the tip of his cigarette . His other hand , the one that had been holding the door , dropped out of sight . His shoulder had a look as though his hidden hand might be making motions . " Do n't know anybody by that name , " he said . " Does he live around here ? " I smiled . He did n't like the smile . His eyes got nasty . I said : " You 're Joe Brody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Got a grift , brother  --  or just amusing yourself ? " " So you 're Joe Brody , " I said . " And you do n't know anybody named Geiger . That 's very funny . " " Yeah ? You got a funny sense of humor maybe.  |p93Take  it away and play on it somewhere else . " I leaned against the door and gave him a dreamy smile . " You got the books , Joe . I got the sucker list . We ought to talk things over . " He did n't shift his eyes from my face . There was a faint sound in the room behind him , as though a metal curtain ring clicked lightly on a metal rod . He glanced sideways into the room . He opened the door wider . " Why not  --  if you think you 've got something ? " he said coolly . He stood aside from the door . I went past him into the room . It was a cheerful room with good furniture and not too much of it . French @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and looked across the dusk at the foothills . Near the windows a closed door in the west wall find near the entrance door another door in the same wall . This last had a plush curtain drawn across it on a thin h rays rod below the lintel . That left the east wall , in which there were no doors . There was a davenport backed against the middle of it , I sat down on the davenport . Brody shut the door andwalked crab-fashion to a tall oak desk studded withsquare nails . A cedarwood box with gilt hinges lay onthe lowered leaf of the desk . He carried the box to aneasy chair midway between the other two doors and satdown . I dropped my hat on the davenport and waited . " Well , I 'm listening , " Brody said . He opened thecigar box and dropped his cigarette stub into a dish atp94his side . He put a long thin cigar in his mouth . " Cigar ? " He tossed one at me through the air . I reached for it . Brody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it at my nose . I looked at the gun . It was a black Police .38 . I had no argument against it at the moment . " Neat , huh ? " Brody said . " Just kind of stand up a minute . Come forward just about two yards . You might grab a little air while you 're doing that . " His voice was the elaborately casual voice of the tough guy in pictures . Pictures have made them all like that . " Tsk , tsk , " I said , not moving at all . " Such a lot of guns around town and so few brains . You 're the second guy I 've met within hours who seems to think a gat in the hand means a world by the tail . Put it down and do n't be silly , Joe . " His eyebrows came together and he pushed his chin at me . His eyes were mean . " The other guy 's name is Eddie Mars , " I said . " Ever hear of him ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me . " If he ever gets wise to where you were last night in the rain , he 'll wipe you off the way a check raiser wipes a check . " " What would I be to Eddie Mars ? " Brody asked coldly . But he lowered the gun to his knee . " Not even a memory , " I said . We stared at each other . I did n't look at the pointedp95black slipper that showed under the plush curtain on the doorway to my left . Brody said quietly : " Do n't get me wrong . I 'm not a tough guy  --  just careful . I do n't know hell 's first whisperabout you . You might be a lifetaker for all I know . " " You 're not careful enough , " I said . " That play with Geiger 's books was terrible . " He drew a long slow breath and let it out silently . Then he leaned back and crossed his long legs and held t he Colt on his knee . " Do n't kid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to , " he said . " What 's your story ? " " Have your friend with the pointed slippers come on in . She gets tired holding her breath . " Brody called out without moving his eyes off my stomach . " Come on in , Agnes . " The curtain swung aside and the green-eyed , thighswingingash blonde from Geiger 's store joined us in the room . She looked at me with a kind of mangled hatred . Her nostrils were pinched and her eyes had darkened a couple of shades . She looked very unhappy . " I knew damn well you were trouble , " she snapped at me . " I told Joe to watch his step . " " It 's not his step , it 's the back of his lap he ought to watch , " I said . " I suppose that 's funny , " the blonde squealed . " It has been , " I said . " But it probably is n't any more . "  | " Save the gags , " Brody advised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Put some light on so I can see to pop this guy , if it works out that way . " The blonde snicked on a light in a big square standing lamp . She sank down into a chair beside the lamp and sat stiffly , as if her girdle was too tight . I put my cigar in my mouth and bit the end off . Brody 's Colt took a close interest in me while I got matches out and lit the cigar . I tasted the smoke and said : " The sucker list I spoke of is in code . I have n't cracked it yet , but there are about five hundred names . You got twelve boxes of books that I know off . You should have at least five hundred books . There 'll be a bunch more out on loan , but say five hundred is the full crop , just to be cautious . If it 's a good active list and you could run it even fifty per cent down the line , that would be one hundred and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that . I 'm only guessing . Put the average rental as low as you like , but it wo n't be less than a dollar . That merchandise costs money . At a dollar a rental you take one hundred and twenty-five grand and you still have your capital . I mean , you still have Geiger 's capital . That 's enough to spot a guy for . " The blonde yelped : " You 're crazy , you goddam egg-headed  --  ! " Brody put his teeth sideways at her and snarled : " Pipe down , for Chrissake . Pipe down ! "  |p97She  subsided into an outraged mixture of slow angoish and bottled fury . Her silvery nails scraped on her knees . " It 's no racket for bums , " I told Brody almost affectionately . " It takes a smooth worker like you , Joe . You 've got to get confidence and keep it . People who spend their money for second-hand sex jags are as nervousas dowagers who ca n't find the rest room . PersonallyI think the blackmail angles are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sticking to legitimate sales and rentals . " Brody 's dark brown stare moved up and down my face . His Colt went on hungering for my vital organs . " You 're a funny guy , " he said tonelessly . " Who has this lovely racket ? " " You have , " I said . " Almost . " The blonde choked and clawed her ear . Brody did n't tray anything . He just looked at me . " What ? " the blonde yelped . " You sit there and try to tell us Mr. Geiger ran that kind of business right down on the main drag ? You 're nuts ! " I leered at her politely . " Sure I do . Everybody knows the racket exists . Hollywood 's made to order for it . If a thing like that has to exist , then right out on the pit met is where all practical coppers want it to exist . For the same reason they favor red light districts . They know where to flush the game when they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You let this cheese- head sit there and insult me , Joe ? You with a gun in your hand and him holding nothing but a cigar and his thumb ? " " I like it , " Brody said . " The guy 's got good ideas . Shut your trap and keep it shut , or I 'll slap it shut for you with this . " He flicked the gun around in an increasinglynegligent manner . The blonde gasped and turned her face to the wall . Brody looked at me and said cunningly : " How have I got that lovely racket ? " " You shot Geiger to get it . Last night in the rain . It was dandy shooting weather . The trouble is he was n't alone when you whiffed him . Either you did n't notice that , which seems unlikely , or you got the wind up and lammed . But you had nerve enough to take the plate out of his camera and you had nerve enough to come back later on and hide his corpse , so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew it had a murder to investigate . " " Yoh , " Brody said contemptuously . The Colt wobbledon his knee . His brown face was as hard as a piece of carved wood . " You take chances , mister . It 's kind of goddamned lucky for you I did n't bop Geiger . " " You can step off for it just the same , " I told him cheerfully . " You 're made to order for the rap . " Brody 's voice rustled . " Think you got me framed for it ? " " Positive . "  | " flow come ? " " There 's somebody who 'll tell it that way . I told you there was a witness . Do n't go simple on me , Joe . " Ile exploded then . " That goddamned little hot pants ! " he yelled . " She would , god damn her ! She would  --  just that ! " I leaned back and grinned at him . " Swell . I thought you had those nude photos of her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't say anything . I let them chew on it . Brody 's face cleared *lowly , with a sort of grayish relief . He put his Colt down on the end table beside his chair but kept his right hand close to it . He knocked ash from his cigar on the rn rpet and stared at me with eyes that were a tight shine between narrowed lids . " I guess you think I 'm dumb , " Brody said . " Just average , for a grifter . Get the pictures . " " What pictures ? " I shook my head . " Wrong play , Joe . Innocence gets you nowhere . You were either there last night , or you got the nude photo from somebody that was there . You know she was there , because you had your girl friend threaten Mrs. Regan with a police rap . The only ways you could know enough to do that would be by seeing what happened or by holding the photo and knowing where and when it was taken . Cough up and be sen-sible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dough , " Brody said . Hep100turned his head a little to look at the green-eyed blonde . Not now green-eyed and only superficially a blonde . She was as limp as a fresh-killed rabbit . " No dough , " I said . He scowled bitterly . " How 'd you get to me ? " I flicked my wallet out and let him look at my buzzer . " I was working on Geiger  --  for a client . I was outside last night , in the rain . I heard the shots . I crashed in . I did n't see the killer . I saw everything else . " " And kept your lip buttoned , " Brody sneered . I put my wallet away . " Yes , " I admitted . " Up till now . Do I get the photos or not ? " " About these books , " Brody said . " I do n't get that . " " I tailed them here from Geiger 's store . I have a witness . " " That punk kid ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kid that works at the store . He skipped out after the truck left .

" " Not even last night , " Brody said sharply . " So she says I gunned him , eh ? " " With the photos in hand I might be able to convince her she was wrong . There was a little drinking being done . "  |p101Brody  sighed . " She hates my guts . I bounced her out . I got paid , sure , but I 'd of had to do it anyway . He 's too screwy for a simple guy like me . " He cleared s throat . " How about a little dough ? I 'm down to ickels . Agnes and me got ta move on . " " Not from my client . " " Listen  --  " " Get the pictures @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said . " You win . " He stood up and slipped the Colt into his side pocket . His left hand went up inside his coat . He was holding it there , his face isted with disgust , when the door buzzer rang and ept on ringing . He did n't like that . His lower lip went in under his teeth , and his eyebrows drew down sharply at the corrs . His whole face became sharp and foxy and mean . The buzzer kept up its song . I did n't like it either . If the visitors should happen to be Eddie Mars and his ys , I might get chilled off just for being there . If it as the police , I was caught with nothing to give them ut a smile and a promise . And if it was some of Brody'sfriends  --  supposing he had any  --  they might turn out to be tougher than he was. , ,  | The blonde did n't like it . She stood up in a surge and chipped at the air with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Watching me , Brody jerked a small drawer in the desk and picked a bone-handled automatic out of it . He held it at the blonde . She slid over to him and took it , shaking . " Sit down next to him , " Brody snapped . " Hold it on him low down , away from the door . If he gets funny use your own judgment . We ai n't licked yet , baby . " " Oh , Joe , " the blonde wailed . She came over and sat next to me on the davenport and pointed the gun at my leg artery . I did n't like the jerky look in her eyes . The door buzzer stopped humming and a quick impatientrapping on the wood followed it . Brody put his hand in his pocket , on his gun , and walked over to the door and opened it with his left hand . Carmen Sternwoodpushed him back into the room by putting a little revolver against his lean brown lips . Brody backed away from her with his mouth work . ing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shut the door behind her and looked neither at me nor at Agnes . She stalked Brody carefully , her tongue sticking out a little between her teeth . Brody took both hands out of his pockets and gestured placatingly at her . His eyebrows designed themselves into an odd assortment of curves and angles . Agnes turned the gunp103way from me and swung it at Carmen . I shot my hand t and closed my fingers down hard over her hand and jammed my thumb on the safety catch . It was already . I kept it on . There was a short silent tussle , to Lich neither Brody nor Carmen paid any attention hatever . I had the gun . Agnes breathed deeply and livered the whole length of her body . Carmen 's faced a bony scraped look and her breath hissed . Her ice said without tone : " I want my pictures , Joe . " Brody swallowed and tried to grin . " Sure , kid , sure . " e said it in a small flat voice that was as much like the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a ten-ton ek . Carmen said : " You shot Arthur Geiger . I saw you . want my pictures . " Brody turned green . " Hey , wait a minute , Carmen , " I yelped . Blonde Agnes came to life with a rush . She ducked her head and sank her teeth in my right hand . I made ore noises and shook her off . " Listen , kid , " Brody whined . " Listen a minute  --  " The blonde spat at me and threw herself on my leg nd tried to bite that . I cracked her on the head with e gun , not very hard , and tried to stand up . She lied down my legs and wrapped her arms around em . I fell back on the davenport . The blonde wasstrong with the madness of love or fear , or a mixture ofboth , or maybe she was just strong.  |p104Brody  grabbed for the little revolver that was no close to his face . He missed . The gun made a slut rapping noise that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ French window . Brody groan ( horribly and fell down on the floor and jerked Ca men 's feet from under her . She landed in a heap an the little revolver went skidding off into a corner . B rod jumped up on his knees and reached for his pocket . I hit Agnes on the head with less delicacy than befo kicked her off my feet , and stood up . Brody flicked hi eyes at me . I showed him the automatic . He stopped trying to get his hand into his pocket . " Christ ! " he whined . " Do n't let her kill me ! " I began to laugh . I laughed like an idiot , without control . Blonde Agnes was sitting up on the floor with her hands flat on the carpet and her mouth wide open and a wick of metallic blond hair down over her right eye . Carmen was crawling on her hands and knees , stillhissing . The metal of her little revolver glistened against the baseboard over in the corner . She crawled towards it relentlessly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and said : " Stay put . You 're all right . " I stepped past the crawling girl and picked the gun up . She looked up at me and began to giggle . I put leer gun in my pocket and patted her on the back . " Get up , angel . You look like a Pekinese . "  |p105I  went over to Brody and put the automatic against in midriff and reached his Colt out of his side pocket . now had all the guns that had been exposed to view . stuffed them into my pockets and held my hand out to him . " Give . " 1k nodded , licking his lips , his eyes still scared . He ok a fat envelope out of his breast pocket and gave to me . There was a developed plate in the envelope and five glossy prints . " Sure these are all ? " He nodded again . I put the envelope in my own mast pocket and turned away . Agnes was back one davenport , straightening her hair . Her eyes ate riven with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet too , coming towards me with her hand out , ill giggling and hissing . There was a little froth atcorners of her mouth . Her small white teeth glinted se to her lips . " Can I have them now ? " she asked me with a coy tile . " I 'll take care of them for you . Go on home . " " 1 tome ? " I went to the door and looked out . The cool nightreeze was blowing peacefully down the hall . No exSitedneighbors hung out of doorways . A small gunhad gone off and broken a pane of glass , but noises like that do n't mean much any more . I held the door open and jerked my head at Carmen . She came towards me , smiling uncertainly . " Go on home and wait for me , " I said soothingly . She put her thumb up . Then she nodded and slipped past me into the hall . She touched my cheek with her fingers as she went by . " You 'll take care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Check . " " You 're cute . " " What you see is nothing , " I said . " I 've got a Bali dancing girl tattooed on my right thigh . " Her eyes rounded . She said : " Naughty , " and wagged a finger at me . Then she whispered : " Can I have my gun ? " " Not now . Later . I 'll bring it to you . " She grabbed me suddenly around the neck and kissed me on the mouth . " I like you , " she said . " Carmenlikes you a lot . " She ran off down the hall as gay as a thrush , waved at me from the stairs and ran down the stairs out of my sight . I went back into Brody 's apartment. the big sleep 107p107I went over to the folded-back French window and looked at the small broken pane in the upper part of it . The bullet from Carmen 's gun had smashed the glass like a blow . It had not made a hole . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keen eye would find quickly enough . I pulled the drapes over the broken pane and took Carmen 's gun out of my pocket . It was a Banker 's Special , .22 caliber , hollow point cartridges . It had a pearl grip , and a small round silver plate set into the butt was engraved : " Carmen from Owen . " She made saps of all of them . I put the gun back in my pocket and sat down close to Brody and stared into his bleak brown eyes . A minutepassed . The blonde adjusted her face by the aid of a pocket mirror . Brody fumbled around with a cigarette and jerked : " Satisfied ? " " So far . Why did you put the bite on Mrs. Regan instead of the old man ? " " Tapped the old man once . About six , seven months ago . I figure maybe he gets sore enough to call in some law . "  | " What made you think Mrs. Regan would n't tell him about it ? " He considered that with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my face . Finally he said : " How well you know her ? " " I 've met her twice . You must know her a lot better to take a chance on that squeeze with the photo . " " She skates around plenty . I figure maybe she has a couple of soft spots she do n't want the old man to know about . I figure she can raise five grand easy . " " A little weak , " I said . " But pass it . You 're broke , eh ? " " I been shaking two nickels together for a month , trying to get them to mate . " " What you do for a living ? " " Insurance . I got desk room in Puss Walgreen 's office , Fulwider Building , Western and Santa Monica . " " When you open up , you open up . The books here in your apartment ? " He snapped his teeth and waved a brown hand . Confidencewas oozing back into his manner . " Hell , no . In storage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then you had a storage outfit come and take them away again right afterwards ? " " Sure . I do n't want them moved direct from Geiger 's place , do I ? " " You 're smart , " I said admiringly . " Anything in.  |p109criminating  in the joint right now ? " He looked worried again . He shook his head sharply . " That 's fine , " I told him . I looked across at Agnes . She had finished fixing her face and was staring at the wall , blank-eyed , hardly listening . Her face had the drowsiness which strain and shock induce , after their first incidence . Brody flicked his eyes warily . " Well ? " " How 'd you come by the photo ? " He scowled . " Listen , you got what you came after , got it plenty cheap . You done a nice neat job . Now go peddle it to your top man . I 'm clean . I do n't know nothing about any photo , do I , Agnes ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vague but uncomplimentary speculation . " A half smart guy , " she said with a tired sniff . " That 's all I ever ( 1 raw . Never once a guy that 's smart all the way around the course . Never once . " I grinned at her . " Did I hurt your head much ? " " You and every other man I ever met . " I looked back at Brody . He was pinching his cigarettebetween his fingers , with a sort of twitch . His hand seemed to be shaking a little . His brown poker face was still smooth . " We 've got to agree on a story , " I said . " For instance , Carmen was n't here . That 's very important . She was n't here . That was a vision you saw . " " Huh ! " Brody sneered . " If you say so , pal , and if  --  " he put his hand out palm up and cupped the fingers and rolled the thumb gently against the index and middle fingers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a small contribution . You wo n't count it in grands , though . Now where did you get the picture ? " " A guy slipped it to me . " " Uh-huh . A guy you just passed in the street . You would n't know him again . You never saw him before . " Brody yawned . " It dropped out of his pocket , " he leered . " Uh-huh . Got an alibi for last night , poker pan ? " " Sure . I was right here . Agnes was with me . Okey , Agnes ? " " I 'm beginning to feel sorry for you again , " I said . His eyes flicked wide and his mouth hung loose , the cigarette balanced on his lower lip . " You think you 're smart and you 're so goddamned dumb , " I told him . " Even if you do n't dance off up in Quentin , you have such a bleak long lonely time ahead of you . " His cigarette jerked and dropped ash on his vest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I said . " Take the air , " he growled suddenly . " Dust . I got enough chinning with you . Beat it . " " Okey . " I stood up and went over to the tall oak desk and took his two guns out of my pockets , laid them side by side on the blotter so that the barrels were ex/actly parallel . I reached my hat off the floor beside the davenport and started for the door . Brody yelped : " Hey ! " I turned and waited . His cigarette was jiggling like a doll on a coiled spring . " Everything 's smooth , ai n't it ? " he asked . " Why , sure . This is a free country . You do n't have to stay out of jail , if you do n't want to . That is , if you 're a citizen . Are you a citizen ? " He just stared at me , jiggling the cigarette . The blonde Agnes turned her head slowly and stared at me along the same level . Their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ doubt and frustrated anger . Agnes reached her silvery nails up abruptly and yanked a hair out of her head and broke it between her fingers , with a bitter jerk . Brody said tightly : " You 're not going to any cops , In-other . Not if it 's the Sternwoods you 're working for . I 've got too much stuff on that family . You got your pictures and you got your hush . Go and peddle your papers . " " Make your mind up , " I said . " You told me to dust , I was on my way out , you hollered at me and I stopped , and now I 'm on my way out again . Is that what you want ? " " You ai n't got anything on me , " Brody said . " Just a couple of murders . Small change in your circle . "  | He did n't jump more than an inch , but it looked like a foot . The white cornea showed all around the tobaccocolorediris of his eyes . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the lamplight . Blonde Agnes let out a low animal wail and buried her head in a cushion on the end of the davenport . I stood there and admired the long line of her thighs . Brody moistened his lips slowly and said : " Sit down , pal . Maybe I have a little more for you . What 's that crack about two murders mean ? " I leaned against the door . " Where were you last night about seven-thirty , Joe ? " His mouth drooped sulkily and he stared down at the floor . " I was watching a guy , a guy who had a nice racket I figured he needed a partner in . Geiger . I was watching him now and then to see had he any tough connections . I figure he has friends or he do n't work the racket as open as he does . But they do n't go to his house . Only dames . " " You did n't watch hard enough , " I said . " Go on . " " I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's raining hard and I 'm buttoned up in mycoupe and I do n't see anything . There 's a car in frontof Geiger 's and another car a little way up the hill . That 's why I stay down below . There 's a big Buickparked down where I am and after a while I go overand take a gander into it . It 's registered to Vivianp113Regan . Nothing happens , so I scram . That 's all . " I le waved his cigarette . His eyes crawled up and down my face . " Could be , " I said . " Know where that Buick is now ? " " Why would I ? " " In the Sheriff 's garage . It was lifted out of twelve feet of water off Lido fish pier this a.m . There was a dead man in it . He had been sapped and the car pointed out the pier and the hand throttle pulled down . " Brody was breathing hard . One of his feet tapped restlessly . " Jesus , guy , you ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Why not ? This Buick was down back of Geiger 's according to you . Well , Mrs. Regan did n't have it out . Her chauffeur , a lad named Owen Taylor , had it out . Hewent over to Geiger 's place to have words with him , because Owen Taylor was sweet on Carmen , and he did n't like the kind of games Geiger was playing with her . He let himself in the back way with a jimmy and a gun and he caught Geiger taking a photo of Carmen without any clothes on . So his gun went off , as guns will , and Geiger fell down dead and Owen ran away , but not without the photo negative Geiger had just taken . So you ran after him and took the photo from him . How else would you have got hold of it ? " Brody licked his lips . " Yeah , " he said . But that do n't make me knock him off . Sure , I heard the shots and saw this killer come slamming down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took out after him . He hit the bottom of the canyon and went west on Sunset . Beyond Beverly Hills he skidded off the road and had to stop and I came up and played copper . He had a gun but his nerve was bad and I sapped him down . So I went through his clothes and found out who he was and I lifted the plateholder , just out of curiosity . I was wonderingwhat it was all about and getting my neck wet when he came out of it all of a sudden and knocked me off the car . He was out of sight when I picked myself up . That 's the last I saw of him . " " How did you know it was Geiger he shot ? " I asked gruffly . Brody shrugged . " I figure it was , but I can be wrong . When I had the plate developed and saw what was on it , I was pretty damn sure . And when Geiger did n't come down to the store this morning and did n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ figure it 's a good time to move his books out and make a quick touch on the Sternwoods for travel money and blow for a while . " I nodded . " That seems reasonable . Maybe you did n't murder anybody at that . Where did you hide Geiger 's body ? " He jumped his eyebrows . Then he grinned . " Nix , nix . Skip it . You think I 'd go back there and handle him , not knowing when a couple carloads of law wouldp115come tearing around the corner ? Nix . " " Somebody hid the body , " I said . Brody shrugged . The grin stayed on his face . He did n't believe me . While he was still not believing me the door buzzer started to ring again . Brody stood up sharply , hard-eyed . He glanced over at his guns on the desk . " So she 's back again , " he growled . " If she is , she does n't have her gun , " I comforted him . " Do n't you have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he growled . " I got enough of this puss in the corner game . " He marched to the desk and took the Colt . He held it down at his side and went to the door . He put his left hand to the knob and twisted it and opened the door a foot and leaned into the opening , holding the gun tight against his thigh . A voice said : " Brody ? " Brody said something I did n't hear . The two quick reports were muffled . The gun must have been pressed tight against Brody 's body . He tilted forward against the door and the weight of his body pushed it shut with a bang . He slid down the wood . His feet pushed the carpet away behind him . His left hand dropped off the knob and the arm slapped the floor with a thud . His head was wedged against the door . He did n't move . The Colt clung to his right hand . I jumped across the room and rolled him enough to get the door @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a door almost opposite . Her face was full of fright and she pointed along the hall with a clawlike hand . I raced down the hall and heard thumping feet going down the tile steps and went down after the sound . At the lobby level the front door was closing itself quietly and running feet slapped the sidewalk outside . I made the door before it was shut , clawed it open again and charged out . A tall hatless figure in a leather jerkin was running diagonally across the street between the parked cars . The figure turned and flame spurted from it . Two heavy hammers hit the stucco wall beside me . The figure ran on , dodged between two cars , vanished . A man came up beside me and barked : " What hap-pened ? " " Shooting going on , " I said . " Jesus ! " He scuttled into the apartment house . I walked quickly down the sidewalk to my car and got in and started it . I pulled out from the curb and drove down the hill , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other side of the street . I thought I heard steps , but I was n't sure about that . I rode down the hill a block and a half , turned at the intersection and started back up . The sound of a muted whistling came to me faintly along the sidewalk . Then steps . I double parked and slid out between two cars and went down low . Ip117took Carmen 's little revolver out of my pocket . The sound of the steps grew louder , and the whistling went on cheerfully . In a moment the jerkin showed . I stepped out between the two cars and said : " Got a match , buddy ? " The boy spun towards me and his right hand darted up to go inside the jerkin . His eyes were a wet shine in the glow of the round electroliers . Moist dark eyes shaped like almonds , and a pallid handsome face with wavy black hair growing low on the forehead in two points . A very handsome boy indeed , the boy from Geiger 's store . Ile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the edge of the jerkin , but not inside it yet . I held the little revolver down at my side . " You must have thought a lot of that queen , " I said . " Go -- yourself , " the boy said softly , motionless between the parked cars and the five-foot retaining wall on the inside of the sidewalk . A siren wailed distantly coming up the long hill . The boy 's head jerked towards the sound . I stepped in dose and put my gun into his jerkin . " Me or the cops ? " I asked him . His head rolled a little sideways as if I had slapped his face . " Who are you ? " he snarled . " Friend of Geiger 's . " " Get away from me , you son of a bitch . "  | " This is a small gun , kid . I 'll give it you through the navel and it will take three months to get you well enough to walk . But you 'll get well . So you can walk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He said : " Go yourself . " His hand moved insidethe jerkin . I pressed harder on his stomach . He let out a long soft sigh , took his hand away from the jerkin and let it fall limp at his side . His wide shoulders sagged . " What you want ? " he whispered . I reached inside the jerkin and plucked out the automatic . " Get into my car , kid . " He stepped past me and I crowded him from behind . He got into the car . " Under the wheel , kid . You drive . " He slid under the wheel and I got into the car beside him . I said : " Let the prowl car pass up the hill . They 'll think we moved over when we heard the siren . Then turn her down hill and we 'll go home . " I put Carmen 's gun away and leaned the automatic against the boy 's ribs . I looked back through the window . The whine of the siren was very loud now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street . They grew larger and blended into one and the car rushed by in a wild flurry of sound . " Let 's go , " I said . The boy swung the car and started off down the hill . " Let 's go home , " I said . " To Laverne Terrace . " His smooth lips twitched . He swung the car west onp119Franklin . " You 're a simple-minded lad . What 's your name ? " " Carol Lundgren , " he said lifelessly . " You shot the wrong guy , Carol . Joe Brody did n't kill your queen . " He spoke three words to me and kept on driving . A moon half gone from the full glowed through a ring of mist among the high branches of the eucalyptus trees on Laverne Terrace . A radio sounded loudly from a house low down the hill . The boy swung the car over to the box hedge in front of Geiger 's house , killed the motor and sat looking straight before him with both hands on the wheel . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " Anybody home , son ? " " You ought to know . " " How would I know ? " " Go yourself . " " That 's how people get false teeth . " He showed me his in a tight grin . Then he kicked the door open and got out . I scuttled out after him . He stood with his fists on his hips , looking silently at thep120house above the top of the hedge . " All right , " I said . " You have a key . Let 's go on in . " " Who said I had a key ? " " Do n't kid me , son . The fag gave you one . You'vn got a nice clean manly little room in there . He shooed you out and locked it up when he had lady visitors . He was like Caesar , a husband to women and a wife to men . Think I ca n't figure people like him and you out ? " I still held his automatic more or less pointed at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ caught me flush on the chin . I backstepped fast enough to keep from falling , but I took plenty of the punch . It was meant to be a hard one , but a pansy has no iron in his bones , whatever he looks like . I threw the gun down at the kid 's feet and said : " Maybe you need this . " He stooped for it like a flash . There was nothing slow about his movements . I sank a fist in the side of his neck . He toppled over sideways , clawing for the gun and not reaching it . I picked it up again and threw it in the car . The boy came up on all fours , leering with his eyes too wide open . He coughed and shook his head . " You do n't want to fight , " I told him . " You 're giving away too much weight . " He wanted to fight . He shot at me like a plane from a catapult , reaching for my knees in a diving tackle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it intop121chancery . He scraped the dirt hard and got his feet under him enough to use his hands on me where it hurt . twisted him around and heaved him a little higher . took hold of my right wrist with my left hand and rued my right hipbone into him and for a moment it a a balance of weights . We seemed to hang there in e misty moonlight , two grotesque creatures whose feet raped on the road and whose breath panted with efrt . I had my right forearm against his windpipe now and 11 the strength of both arms in it . His feet began a frenetic shuffle and he was n't panting any more . He as ironbound . His left foot sprawled off to one side and the knee went slack . I held on half a minute longer . e sagged on my arm , an enormous weight I could rdly hold up . Then I let go . He sprawled at my feet , t cold . I went to the car and got a pair of handcuffs t of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them on . I lifted him by the armpits and managed to drag him in behind the hedge , t of sight from the street . I went back to the car and moved it a hundred feet up the hill and locked it . He was still out when I got back . I unlocked the or , dragged him into the house , shut the door . He as beginning to gasp now . I switched a lamp on . His es fluttered open and focused on me slowly . I bent down , keeping out of the way of his knees and id : " Keep quiet or you 'll get the same and more of it . Just lie quiet and hold your breath . Hold it until you ca n't hold it any longer and then tell yourself that you have to breathe , that you 're black in the face , that your eyeballs are popping out , and that you 're going to breathe right now , but that you 're sitting strapped in the chair in the clean little gas chamber up in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fighting with all your soul not to take , it wo n't be air you 'll get , it will be cyanide fumes . And that 's what they call humane execution in our state now . " " Go yourself , " he said with a soft stricken sigh . " You 're going to cop a plea , brother , do n't ever think you 're not . And you 're going to say just what we want you to say and nothing we do n't want you to say . " " Go yourself . " " Say that again and I 'll put a pillow under your head . " His mouth twitched . I left him lying on the floor with his wrists shackled behind him and his cheek pressed into the rug and an animal brightness in his visible eye . I put on another lamp and stepped into the hallway at the back of the living room . Geiger 's bedroom did n't seem to have been touched . I opened the door , not locked now , of the bedroom across the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the room and a smell of sandalwood . Two cones of incense ash stood side by side on a small brass tray on the bureau . The light came from the two tall black candles in the **25;5766;TOOLONG . They were standing on straight-backed chairs , one on either side of the bed . Geiger lay on the bed . The two missing strips of Chinese tapestry made a St. Andrew 's Cross over the middle of his body , hiding the blood-smeared front of his Chinese coat . Below the cross his black-pajama 'd legs lay stiff and straight . His feet were in the slippers with thick white felt soles . Above the cross his arms were crossed at the wrists and his hands lay flat against his shoulders , palms down , fingers close together and stretched out evenly . His mouth was closed and his Charlie Chan moustache was as unreal as a toupee . His Inroad nose was pinched and white . His eyes were almostclosed , but not entirely . The faint glitter of his glass eye caught the light and winked at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very near him . He would be as cold as ice and as stiff as a board . The black candles guttered in the draft from the open door . Drops of black wax crawled down their sides . The air of the room was poisonous and unreal . I went out and shut the door again and went back to the living room . The boy had n't moved . I stood still , listening for sirens . It was all a question of how soon Agnes talked and what she said . If she talked about Geiger , the police would be there any minute . But she might not talk for hours . She might even have got away . I looked down at the boy . " Want to sit up , son ? " He closed his eye and pretended to go to sleep . I wentp124over to the desk and scooped up the mulberry-colored phone and dialed Bernie Ohls ' office . He had left to go home at six o'clock . I dialed the number of his home . He was there . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your boys find a revolver on Owen Taylor this morning ? " I could hear him clearing his throat and then I could hear him trying to keep the surprise out of his voice . " That would come under the heading of police business , " he said . " If they did , it had three empty shells in it . " " How the hell did you know that ? " Ohls asked quietly . " Come over to 7244 Laverne Terrace , off Laurel Canyon Boulevard . I 'll show you where the slugs went . " " Just like that , huh ? " " Just like that . " Ohls said : " Look out the window and you 'll see me coming round the corner . I thought you acted a little cagey on that one . " " Cagey is no word for it , " I said. the big sleep 125p125Ohls stood looking down at the boy . The boy sat on the couch leaning sideways against the wall . Ohls looked at him silently , his pale eyebrows bristling and ht @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hiller Brush man gives away . He asked the boy : " Do you admit shooting Brody ? " The boy said his favorite three words in a muffled voice . Ohls sighed and looked at me . I said : " He does n't have to admit that . I have his gun . " Ohls said : " I wish to Christ I had a dollar for every time I 've had that said to me . What 's funny about it ? " " It 's not meant to be funny , " I said . " Well , that 's something , " Ohls said . He turned away . " I 've called Wilde . We 'll go over and see him and take this punk . He can ride with me and you can follow on behind in case he tries to kick me in the face . " " How do you like what 's in the bedroom ? " " I like it fine , " Ohls said . " I 'm kind of glad that Taylor kid went off the pier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the deathhouse for rubbing that skunk . " I went back into the small bedroom and blew out the black candles and let them smoke . When I got back to the living room Ohls had the boy up on his feet . The boy stood glaring at him with sharp black eyes in a face as hard and white as cold mutton fat . " Let 's go , " Ohls said and took him by the arm as if he did n't like touching him . I put the lamps out and followed them out of the house . We got into our cars and I followed Ohls ' twin tail-lights down the long curvinghill . I hoped this would be my last trip to Laverne Terrace . Taggart Wilde , the District Attorney , lived at the corner of Fourth and Lafayette Park , in a white frame house the size of a carbarn , with a red sandstone portecocherebuilt on to one side and a couple of acres of soft rolling lawn in front . It was one of those solid oldfashionedhouses which it used to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the city grew westward . Wilde came of an old Los Angeles family and had probably been born in the house when it was on West Adams or Figueroa or St. James Park . There were two cars in the driveway already , a big private sedan and a police car with a uniformed chauffeurwho leaned smoking against his rear fender and admired the moon . Ohls went over and spoke to him and the chauffeur looked in at the boy in Ohls ' car . We went up to the house and rang the bell . A slickhairedblond man opened the door and led us down the hall and through a huge sunken living room crowdedp127with heavy dark furniture and along another hall on the far side of it . He knocked at a door and stepped inside , then held the door wide and we went into a paneled study with an open French door at the end and a view of dark garden and mysterious trees . A smell of wet earth and flowers came in at the window . There were large dim oils on the walls @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cigar smoke which blended with the smell of wet earth and flowers . Taggart Wilde sat behind a desk , a middle-aged plump man with clear blue eyes that managed to have it friendly expression without really having any expressionat all . He had a cup of black coffee in front of him and he held a dappled thin cigar between the neat careful fingers of his left hand . Another man sat at the corner of the desk in a blue leather chair , a cold-eyed hatchet-faced man , as lean as a rake and as hard as the manager of a loan office . His neat well-kept face looked as if it had been shaved within the hour . He wore a well-pressed brown suit and there was a black pearl in his tie . He had the long nervous fingers of a man with a quick brain . He looked ready for a fight . Ohls pulled a chair up and sat down and said : " Evening , Cronjager . Meet Phil Marlowe , a private eye who 's in a jam . " Ohls grinned . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over as if he was looking at a photograph . Then he nodded his chin about an inch . Wilde said : " Sit down ,  | Marlowe . I 'll try to handle Captain Cronjager , but you know how it is . This is a big city now . " I sat down and lit a cigarette . Ohls looked at Cron. jager and asked : " What did you get on the Randall Place killing ? " The hatchet-faced man pulled one of his fingers until the knuckle cracked . He spoke without looking up . " A stiff , two slugs in him . Two guns that had n't been fired . Down on the street we got a blonde trying to start a car that did n't belong to her . Hers was right next to it , the same model . She acted rattled so the boys brought her in and she spilled . She was in there when this guy Brody got it . Claims she did n't see the killer . " " That all ? " Ohls asked . Cronjager raised his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What did you expect  --  movingpictures of the killing ? " " Maybe a description of the killer , " Ohls said . " A tall guy in a leather jerkin  --  if you call that a description . " " He 's outside in my heap , " Ohls said . " Handcuffed . Marlowe put the arm on him for you . Here 's his gun . " Ohls took the boy 's automatic out of his pocket and laid it on a corner of Wilde 's desk . Cronjager looked at the gun but did n't reach for it . Wilde chuckled . He was leaning back and puffing his dappled cigar without letting go of it . He bent forward to sip from his coffee cup . He took a silk hand-lp129kerchief from the breast pocket of the dinner jacket he was wearing and touched his lips with it and tucked it away again . " There 's a couple more deaths involved , " Ohls said , pinching the soft flesh at the end of his chin . Cronjager stiffened visibly . His surly eyes became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard about a car being lifted out of the Pacific Ocean off Lido pier this a.m. with a dead guy in it ? " Cronjager said : " No , " and kept on looking nasty . " The dead guy in the car was chauffeur to a rich family , " Ohls said . " The family was being blackmailedon account of one of the daughters . Mr. Wilde recommended Marlowe to the family , through me . Marloweplayed it kind of close to the vest . " " I love private dicks that play murders close to the vest , " Cronjager snarled . " You do n't have to be so goddamned coy about it . " " Yeah , " Ohls said . " I do n't have to be so goddamnedcoy about it . It 's not so goddamned often I get a chance to be coy with a city copper . I spend most of my time telling them where to put their feet so they wo n't break an ankle . " Cronjager whitened arou " d the corners of his sharp nose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room . He said very quietly : " You have n't had to tell any of my men where to put their feet , smart guy . "  | " We 'll see about that , " Ohls said . " This chauffeur I spoke of that 's drowned off Lido shot a guy last night in your territory . A guy named Geiger who ran a dirty book racket in a store on Hollywood Boulevard . Geiger was living with the punk I got outside in my car . I mean living with him , if you get the idea . " Cronjager was staring at him levelly now . " That sounds like it might grow up to be a dirty story , " he said . " It 's my experience most police stories are , " Ohls growled and turned to me , his eyebrows bristling . " You 're on the air , Marlowe . Give it to him . " I gave it to him . I left out two things , not knowing just why , at the moment , I left out one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brody 's apartment and Eddie Mars ' visit to Geiger 's in the afternoon . I told the rest of it just as it happened . Cronjager never took his eyes off my face and no expression of any kind crossed his as I talked . At the end of it he was perfectly silent for a long minute . Wilde was silent , sipping his coffee , puffing gently at his dappledcigar . Ohls stared at one of his thumbs . Cronjager leaned slowly back in his chair and crossed one ankle over his knee and rubbed the ankle bone with his thin nervous hand . His lean face wore a harsh frown . He said with deadly politeness : " So all you did was not report a murder that hap-P131funned last night and then spend today foxing around so that this kid of Geiger 's could commit a second murderthis evening . " " That 's all , " I said . " I was in a pretty tough spot . I 1 guess I did wrong , but I wanted to protect my client and I had n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " That kind of thinking is police business , Marlowe . I f Geiger 's death had been reported last night , the books could never have been moved from the store to Brody 's apartment . The kid would n't have been led to Brody and would n't have killed him . Say Brody was living on borrowed time . His kind usually are . But a life is a life . " " Right , " I said . " Tell that to your coppers next time they shoot down some scared petty larceny crook running away up an alley with a stolen spare . " Wilde put both his hands down on his desk with a solid smack . ' rhat 's enough of that , " he snapped . " What makes you so sure , Marlowe , that this Taylor boy shot Geiger ? Even if the gun that killed Geiger was found on Taylor 's body or in the car , it does n't absolutely follow that he was the killer . The gun might have been planted  --  say by Brody , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said , " but morally impossible . It assumes too much coincidence and too much that 's out of character for Brody and his girl , and out of character for what he was trying to do . I talked to Brody for a long time . He was a crook , but not a killer type . He had two guns , but he was n't wearingeither of them . He was trying to find a way to cut in on Geiger 's racket , which naturally he knew all about from the girl . He says he was watching Geiger off and on to see if he had any tough backers . I believe him . To suppose he killed Geiger in order to get his books , then scrammed with the nude photo Geiger had just taken of Carmen Sternwood , then planted the gun on Owen Taylor and pushed Taylor into the ocean off Lido , is to suppose a hell of a lot too much . Taylor had the motive , jealous rage , and the opportunity to kill Geiger . He was out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killed Geiger right in front of the girl , which Brody would never have done , even if he had been a killer . I ca n't see anybody with a purely commercial interest in Geiger doing that . But Taylor would have done it . The nude photo business was just what would have made him do it . " Wilde chuckled and looked along his eyes at Cronjager . Cronjager cleared his throat with a snort . Wilde asked : " What 's this business about hiding the body ? I do n't see the point of that . " I said : " The kid has n't told us , but he must have done it . Brody would n't have gone into the house after Geiger was shot . The boy must have got home when I was away taking Carmen to her house . He was afraid of the police , of course , being what he is , and he prob/ably thought it a good idea to have the body hidden until he had removed his effects from the house . He dragged it out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rug , and very likely put it in the garage . Then he packed up what ever belongings he had there and took them away . And later on , sometime in the night and before the body stiffened , he had a revulsion of feeling and thought he had n't treated his dead friend very nicely . So he went back and laid him out on the bed . That 's all guessing , of course . " Wilde nodded . " Then this morning he goes down to the store as if nothing had happened and keeps his eyes open . And when Brody moved the books out he found out where they were going and assumed that whoever got them had killed Geiger just for that purpose . He may even have known more about Brody and the girl than they suspected . What do you think , Ohls ? " Ohls said : " We 'll find out  --  but that does n't help Cronjager 's troubles . What 's eating him is all this happenedlast night and he 's only just been rung in on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can find some way to deal with that angle too . " He looked at me sharply and immediately looked away again . Wilde waved his cigar and said : " Let 's see the exhibits , Marlowe . " I emptied my pockets and put the catch on his desk : the three notes and Geiger 's card to General Sternwood , Carmen 's photos , and the blue notebook with the code list of names and addresses . I had already given Geiger'skeys to Ohls . Wilde looked at what I gave him , puffing gently at his cigar . Ohls lit one of his own toy cigars and blew smoke peacefully at the ceiling . Cronjager leaned on the desk and looked at what I had given Wilde . Wilde tapped the three notes signed by Carmen and said : " I guess these were just a come-on . If General Sternwood paid them , it would be through fear of something worse . Then Geiger would have tightened the screws . Do you know what he was afraid of ? " He was looking at me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story complete in all relevant details ? " " I left out a couple of personal matters . I intend to keep on leaving them out , Mr. Wilde . " Cronjager said : " Hah ! " and snorted with deep feeling . " Why ? " Wilde asked quietly . " Because my client is entitled to that protection , short of anything but a Grand Jury . I have a license to operateas a private detective . I suppose that word private ' has some meaning . The Hollywood Division has two murders on its hands , both solved . They have both killers . They have the motive , the instrument in each case . The blackmail angle has got to be suppressed , as far as the names of the parties are concerned . "   " Why ? " Wilde asked again . " That 's okey , " Cronjager said dryly . " We 're glad to stooge for a shamus of his standing . " I said : " I 'll show you . " I got up and went back out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geiger 's store out of it . The uniformed police driver was standing beside Ohls ' car . The boy was inside it , leaning back sideways in the corner . " Has he said anything ? " I asked . " He made a suggestion , " the copper said and spat . " I 'm letting it ride . " I went back into the house , put the book on Wilde 's desk and opened up the wrappings . Cronjager was usinga telephone on the end of the desk . He hung up and sat down as I came in . Wilde looked through the book , wooden-faced , closed it and pushed it towards Cronjager . Cronjager opened it , looked at a page or two , shut it quickly . A couple of red spots the size of half dollars showed on his cheekbones . I said : " Look at the stamped dates on the front end-paper . " Cronjager opened the book again and looked at them . " Well ? " " If necessary , " I said , " I 'll testify under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The blonde , Agnes , will admit what kind of business the store did . It 's obvious to anybody with eyes that that store is just a front for something . But the Hollywood police allowed it to operate , for their own reasons . I dare say the Grand Jury would like to know what those reasons are . " Wilde grinned . He said : " Grand Juries do ask those embarrassing questions sometimes  --  in a rather vain effort to find out just why cities are run as they are run . " Cronjager stood up suddenly and put his hat on . " I 'm one against three here , " he snapped . " I 'm a homicide man . If this Geiger was running indecent literature , that 's no skin off my nose . But I 'm ready to admit it wo n't help my division any to have it washed over in the papers . What do you birds want ? " Wilde looked at Ohls . Ohls said calmly : " I want to turn a prisoner over to you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at him fiercely and stalked out of the room . Ohls went after him . The door closed again . Wilde tapped on his desk and stared at me with his clear blue eyes . " You ought to understand how any copper would feel about a cover-up like this , " he said . " You 'll have to make statements of all of it  --  at least for the files . I think it may be possible to keep the two killings separateand to keep General Sternwood 's name out of both of them . Do you know why I 'm not tearing your ear off ? " " No . I expected to get both ears torn off . " " What are you getting for it all ? " " Twenty-five dollars a day and expenses . "  | " That would make fifty dollars and a little gasoline so far . " " About that . " He put his head on one side and rubbed the back of his left little finger along the lower edge of his chin . " And for that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dutch with half the law enforcement of this county ? " " I do n't like it , " I said . " But what the hell am I to do ? I 'm on a case . I 'm selling what I have to sell to make a living . What little guts and intelligence the Lord gave me and a willingness to get pushed around in order to protect a client . It 's against my principles to tell as much as I 've told tonight , without consulting the General . As for the cover-up , I 've been in police business myself , as you know . They come a dime a dozen in any big city . Cops get very large and emphatic when an outsider tries to hide anything , but they do the same things themselves every other day , to oblige their friends or anybody with a little pull . And I 'm not through . I 'm still on the case . I 'd do the same thing again , if I had to . " " Providing Cronjager does n't get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you held back a couple of personal matters . Of what import ? " " I 'm still on the case , " I said , and stared straight into his eyes . Wilde smiled at me . He had the frank daring smile of an Irishman . " Let me tell you something , son . My father was a close friend of old Sternwood . I 've done all my office permits  --  and maybe a good deal more  --  to save the old man from grief . But in the long run it ca n't be done . Those girls of his are bound certain to hook up with something that ca n't be hushed , especially that little blonde brat . They ought not to be running around loose . I blame the old man for that . I guess he does n't realize what the world is today . And there 's another thing I might mention while we 're talking man to man and I do n't have to growl at you . I 'll bet a dollar to a Canadian dime that the General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up in this somewhere , and what he really hoped you would find out is that he is n't . What do you think of that ? " " Regan did n't sound like a blackmailer , what I heard of him . He had a soft spot where he was and he walked out on it . " Wilde snorted . " The softness of that spot neither you nor I could judge . If he was a certain sort of man , it would not have been so very soft . Did the General tell you he was looking for Regan ? " " He told me he wished he knew where he was andthat he was all right . He liked Regan and was hurt the way he bounced off without telling the old man good-by . " Wilde leaned back and frowned . " I see , " he said ina changed voice . His hand moved the stuff on his deskaround , laid Geiger 's blue notebook to one side andP39pushed the other exhibits towards me . " You may as well take these , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It was close to eleven when I put my car away and walked around to the front of the Hobart Arms . The plate-glass door was put on the lock at ten , so I had to get my keys out . Inside , in the square barren lobby , a man put a green evening paper down beside a potted palm and flicked a cigarette butt into the tub the palm grew in . He stood up and waved his hat at me and said : " The boss wants to talk to you . You sure keep your friends waiting , pal . " I stood still and looked at his flattened nose and club steak ear . " What about ? " " What do you care ? Just keep your nose clean and everything will be jake . " His hand hovered near the upper buttonhole of his open coat . " I smell of policemen , " I said . " I 'm too tired to talk , too tired to eat , too tired to think . But if you think I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ try gettingyour gat out before I shoot your good ear off . "  | " Nuts . You ai n't got no gun . " He stared at me levelly . His dark wiry brows closed in together and his mouth made a downward curve . " That was then , " I told him . " I 'm not always naked . " He waved his left hand . " Okey . You win . I was n't told to blast anybody . You 'll hear from him . " " Too late will be too soon , " I said , and turned slowly as he passed me on his way to the door . He opened it and went out without looking back . I grinned at my own foolishness , went along to the elevator and upstairs to the apartment . I took Carmen 's little gun out of my pocket and laughed at it . Then I cleaned it thoroughly , oiled it , wrapped it in a piece of canton flannel and locked it up . I made myself a drink and was drinking it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table on which it stood . " So you 're tough tonight , " Eddie Mars ' voice said . " Big , fast , tough and full of prickles . What can I do for you ? " " Cops over there  --  you know where . You keep me out of it ? " " Why should I ? " " I 'm nice to be nice to , soldier . I 'm not nice not to be nice to . " " Listen hard and you 'll hear my teeth chattering . " He laughed dryly . " Did you  --  or did you ? " " I did . I 'm damned if I know why . I guess it wasjust complicated enough without you . "  | " Thanks , soldier . Who gunned him ? " " Read it in the paper tomorrow  --  maybe . " " I want to know now . " " Do you get everything you want ? " " No . Is that an answer , soldier ? " " Somebody you never heard of gunned him . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the level , someday I may be able to do you a favor . " " Hang up and let me go to bed . " He laughed again . " You 're looking for Rusty Regan , are n't you ? " " A lot of people seem to think I am , but I 'm not . " " If you were , I could give you an idea . Drop in andsee me down at the beach . Any time . Glad to see you . " " Maybe . " " Be seeing you then . " The phone clicked and I sat holding it with a savage patience . Then I dialed the Sternwoods ' number and heard it ring four or five times and then the butler 's suave voice saying : " General Sternwood 's residence . " " This is Marlowe . Remember me ? I met you about a hundred years ago  --  or was it yesterday ? " " Yes , Mr. Marlowe . I remember , of course . " " Is Mrs. Regan home ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cut in on him with a sudden change of mind . " No . You give her the message . Tell her I have the pictures ,  | all of them , and that everything is all right . " " Yes . . . yes . . . . " The voice seemed to shake a little . " You have the pictures  --  all of them  --  and everything is all right . . . . Yes , sir . I may say  --  thank you very much , sir . " The phone rang back in five minutes . I had finished my drink and it made me feel as if I could eat the dinnerI had forgotten all about ; I went out leaving the telephone ringing . It was ringing when I came back . It rang at intervals until half-past twelve . At that time I put my lights out and opened the windows up and muffledthe phone bell with a piece of paper and went to bed . I had a bellyful of the Sternwood family . I read all three of the morning papers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounts of the affaircame as close to the truth as newspaper stories usuallycome  --  as close as Mars is to Saturn . None of the three connected Owen Taylor , driver of the Lido Pier Suicide Car , with the Laurel Canyon Exotic Bungalow Slaying . None of them mentioned the Sternwoods , BernieOhls or me . Owen Taylor was " chauffeur to a wealthy family . " Captain Cronjager of the Hollywood Division got all the credit for solving the two slayings in his district , which were supposed to arise out of a disputeover the proceeds from a wire service maintained by one Geiger in the back of the bookstore on HollywoodBoulevard . Brody had shot Geiger and Carol Lundgren had shot Brody in revenge . Police were hold-P143ing Carol Lundgren in custody . He had confessed . He had a bad record  --  probably in high school . Police were also holding one Agnes Lozelle , Geiger 's secretary , as a material witness . It was a nice write-up . It gave the impression that Geiger had been killed the night before , that Brody had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ solved both murders while lighting a cigarette . The suicide of Taylor made Page One of Section IL There was a photo of the sedan on the deck of the power lighter , with the license plate blacked out , and somethingcovered with a cloth lying on the deck beside the running board . Owen Taylor had been despondent and in poor health . His family lived in Dubuque , and his body would be shipped there . There would be no inquest . Captain Gregory of the Missing Persons Bureau laid my card down on his wide flat desk and arranged it so that its edges exactly paralleled the edges of the desk . He studied it with his head on one side , grunted , swung around in his swivel chair and looked out of his window at the barred top floor of the Hall of Justice half a block away . He was a burly man with tired eyes and the slow deliberate movements of a night watchman . His voice was toneless , flat and uninterested . " Private dick , eh ? " he said , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his window . Smoke wisped front the blackened bowl of a briar that hung on his eye tooth . " What can I do for you ? " " I 'm working for General Guy Stemwood , 3765 Alta Brea Crescent , West Hollywood . " Captain Gregory blew a little smoke from the corner of his mouth without removing the pipe . " On what ? " " Not exactly on what you 're working on , but I 'm interested . I thought you could help me . " " Help you on what ? " " General Sternwood 's a rich man , " I said . " He 's an old friend of the D.A . ' s father . If he wants to hire a full-time boy to run errands for him , that 's no reflection on the police . It 's just a luxury he is able to afford him-self . " " What makes you think I 'm doing anything for him ? " I did n't answer that . He swung around slowly and heavily in his swivel chair and put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his floor . His office had the musty smell of years of routine . He stared at me bleakly . " I do n't want to waste your time , Captain , " I saidP145and pushed my chair back  --  about four inches . He did n't move . He kept on staring at me out of his washed-out tired eyes . " You know the D.A. ? " " I 've met him . I worked for him once . I know BernieOhls , his chief investigator , pretty well . " Captain Gregory reached for a phone and mumbled into it : " Get me Ohls at the D.A . ' s office . " He sat holding the phone down on its cradle . Momentspassed . Smoke drifted from his pipe . His eyes were heavy and motionless like his hand . The bell tinkled and he reached for my card with his left hand . " Ohls ? . . . Al Gregory at headquarters . A guy teamed Philip Marlowe is in my office . His card says lie 's a private investigator . He wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does he look like ? . . . Okey , thanks . " He dropped the phone and took his pipe out of his mouth and tamped the tobacco with the brass cap of a heavy pencil . He did it carefully and solemnly , as if that was as important as anything he would have to do that day . He leaned back and stared at me some more . " What you want ? " " An idea of what progress you 're making , if any . " He thought that over . " Regan ? " he asked finally . " Sure . " " Know him ? " " I never saw him . I hear he 's a good-looking Irish- man in his late thirties , that he was once in the liquor racket , that he married General Sternwood 's older daughter and that they did n't click . I 'm told he disappeared about a month back . " " Sternwood ought a think himself lucky instead of hiring private talent to beat around in the tall grass . " " The General @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man is crippled and lonely . Regan used to sit around with him and keep him company . " " What you think you can do that we ca n't do ? " " Nothing at all , in so far as finding Regan goes . But there 's a rather mysterious blackmail angle . I want to make sure Regan is n't involved . Knowing where he is or is n't might help . " " Brother , I 'd like to help you , but I do n't know where he is . He pulled down the curtain and that 's that . " " Pretty hard to do against your organization , is n't it , Captain ? " " Yeah  --  but it can be done  --  for a while . " He touched a bell button on the side of his desk . A middleagedwoman put her head in at a side door . " Get me the file on Terence Regan , Abba . " The door closed . Captain Gregory and I looked at each other in some more heavy silence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tabbed green file on his desk . Captain Gregory nodded her out , put a pair of heavy horn-rimmed glasses on his veined nose and turned the papers in the file over slowly . I rolled aP147cigarette around in my fingers . " He blew on the 16th of September , " he said . " The only thing important about that is it was the chauffeur 's day off and nobody saw Regan take his car out . It was late afternoon , though . We found the car four days later in a garage belonging to a ritzy bungalow court place near the Sunset Towers . A garage man reported it to the stolen car detail , said it did n't belong there . The place is called the Casa de Oro . There 's an angle to that I 'll tell you about in a minute . We could n't find out anything about who put the car in there . We print the car but do n't find any prints that are on file anywhere . The car in that garage do n't jibe with foul play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It jibes with something else I 'll tell you about in a minute . " I said : " That jibes with Eddie Mars ' wife being on the missing list . " He looked annoyed . " Yeah . We investigate the ten , ants and find she 's living there . Left about the time Regan did , within two days anyway . A guy who sounds a bit like Regan had been seen with her , but we do n't get a positive identification . It 's goddamned funny in this police racket how an old woman can look out of a window and see a guy running and pick him out of a line-up six months later , but we can show hotel help a clear photo and they just ca n't be sure . " " That 's one of the qualifications for good hotel help , " I said.  | " Yeah . Eddie Mars and his wife did n't live together , but they were friendly , Eddie says . Here 's some of the possibilities . First off Regan carried fifteen grand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Real money , they tell me . Not just a top card and a bunch of hay . That 's a lot of jack but this Regan might be the boy to have it around so he could take it out and look at it when somebody was looking at him . Then again maybe he would n't give a damn . His wife says he never made a nickel off of old man Sternwood except room and board and a Packard 120 his wife gave him . Tie that for an exleggerin the rich gravy . " " It beats me , " I said . " Well , here we are with a guy who ducks out and has fifteen grand in his pants and folks know it . WelI , that 's money . I might duck out myself , if I had fifteen grand , and me with two kids in high school . So the first thought is somebody rolls him for it and rolls him too hard , so they have to take him out in the desert and plant him among the cactuses . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gat and had plenty of experience using it , and not just in a greasy-faced liquor mob . I understand he commanded a whole brigade in the Irish troubles back in 1922 or whenever it was . A guy like that would n't be white meat to a heister . Then , his car being in that garage makes whoever rolled him know he was sweet on Eddie Mars ' wife , which he was , I guess , but it ai n't something every poolroom bum would know . "   " Got a photo ? " I asked . " Him , not her . That 's funny too . There 's a lot of funny angles to this case . Here . " He pushed a shiny print across the desk and I looked at an Irish face that was more sad than merry and more reserved than brash . Not the face of a tough guy and not the face of a man who could be pushed around much by anybody . Straight dark brows with strong bone under them . A forehead wide rather than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thin short nose , a wide mouth . A chin that had strong I i nes but was small for the mouth . A face that looked a little taut , the face of a man who would move fast and play for keeps . I passed the print back . I would know that face , if I saw it . Captain Gregory knocked his pipe out and refilled it and tamped the tobacco down with his thumb . He lit it , blew smoke and began to talk again . " Well , there could be people who would know he was sweet on Eddie Mars ' frau . Besides Eddie himself . For a wonder he knew it . But he do n't seem to give a damn . We check him pretty thoroughly around that time . Of course Eddie would n't have knocked him off out of jealousy . The set-up would point to him too obvious . " " It depends how smart he is , " I said . " He might try the double bluff . " Captain Gregory shook his head . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his racket , he 's too smart for that . I get your idea . He pulls the dumb play because hep150thinks we would n't expect him to pull the dumb play . From a police angle that 's wrong . Because he 'd have us in his hair so much it would interfere with his business . You might think a dumb play would be smart . I might think so . The rank and file would n't . They 'd make his life miserable . I 've ruled it out . If I 'm wrong , you can prove it on me and I 'll eat my chair cushion . Till then I 'm leaving Eddie in the clear . Jealousy is a bad motive for his type . Top-flight racketeers have business brains . They learn to do things that are good policy and let their personal feelings take care of themselves . I 'm leaving that out . " " What are you leaving in ? " " The dame and Regan himself . Nobody else . She was a blonde then , but she wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so they probably left in it . They had a long start on us  --  fourteen days . Except for that car of Regan 's I do n't figure we 'd have got the case at all . Of course I 'm used to them that way , especially in goodclassfamilies . And of course everything I 've done has had to be under the hat . " He leaned back and thumped the arms of his chair with the heels of his large heavy hands . " I do n't see nothing to do but wait , " he said . " We 've got readers out , but it 's too soon to look for results . Regan had fifteen grand we know of . The girl had some , maybe a lot in rocks . But they 'll run out of dough some day . Regan will cash a check , drop a marker , write aP151letter . They 're in a strange town and they 've got new names , but they 've got the same old appetites . They got to get back in the fiscal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she married Eddie Mars ? " " Torcher . " " Ca n't you get any old professional photos ? " " No . Eddie must of had some , but he wo n't loosen up . He wants her let alone . I ca n't make him . He 's got friends in town , or he would n't be what he is . " He grunted . " Any of this do you any good ? " I said : " You 'll never find either of them . The Pacific Ocean is too close . " " What I said about my chair cushion still goes . We 'll find him . It may take time . It could take a year or two . " " General Sternwood may not live that long , " I said . " We 've done all we could , brother . If he wants to put out a reward and spend some money , we might get results . The city do n't give me the kind of money it takes . " His large eyes peered at me and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eddie put them both down ? " I laughed . " No . I was just kidding . I think what you think , Captain . That Regan ran away with a woman who meant more to him than a rich wife he did n't get along with . Besides , she is n't rich yet . " " You met her , I suppose ? "  | " Yes . She 'd make a jazzy week-end , but she 'd be wearing for a steady diet . " He grunted and I thanked him for his time and iiiformationand left . A gray Plymouth sedan tailed Inc away from the City Hall . I gave it a chance to catch up with me on a quiet street . It refused the offer , so I shook it off and went about my business . I did n't go near the Sternwood family . I went back to the office and sat in my swivel chair and tried to catch up on my foot-dangling . There was a gusty wind blowingin at the windows and the soot from the oil burners @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and rolling across the top of the desk like tumbleweed drifting across a vacant lot . I was thinking about going out to lunch and that life was pretty flat and that it would probably be just as flat if I took a drink and that taking a drink all alone at that time of day would n't be any fun anyway . I was thinking this when Norris called up . In his carefully polite manner he said that General Sternwood was not feeling very well and that certain items in the newspaper had been read to him and lie assumed that my investigation was now completed.  | " Yes , as regards Geiger , " I said . " I did n't shoot him , you know . " " The General did n't suppose you did , Mr. Marlowe . " " Does the General know anything about those photographsMrs . Regan was worrying about ? " " No , sir . Decidedly not . " " Did you know what the General gave me ? " " Yes , sir . Three notes and a card , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them . As to the photos I think I'dbetter just destroy them . " " Very good , sir . Mrs. Regan tried to reach you a number of times last night  --  " " I was out getting drunk , " I said . " Yes . Very necessary , sir , I 'm sure . The General has instructed me to send you a check for five hundred dollars . Will that be satisfactory ? " " More than generous , " I said . " And I presume we may now consider the incident closed ? " " Oh sure . Tight as a vault with a busted time lock . " " Thank you , sir . I am sure we all appreciate it . When the General is feeling a little better  --  possibly tomorrow  --  he would like to thank you in person . " " Fine , " I said . " I 'll come out and drink some more of his brandy , maybe with champagne . " " I shall see that some is properly iced , " the old boy said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that . We said good-by and hung up . Thep154coffee shop smell from next door came in at the windowswith the soot but failed to make me hungry . So I got out my office bottle and took the drink and let my self-respect ride its own race . I counted it up on my fingers . Rusty Regan had run away from a lot of money and a handsome wife to go wandering with a vague blonde who was more or less married to a racketeer named Eddie Mars . He had gone suddenly without good-bys and there might be any number of reasons for that . The General had been too proud , or , at the first interview he gave me , too careful , to tell me the Missing Persons Bureau had the matter in hand . The Missing Persons people were dead on their feet on it and evidently did n't think it worth bothering over . Regan had done what he had done and that was his business . I agreed with Captain Gregory that Eddie Mars would have been very unlikely to involvehimself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to town with the blonde he was not even living with . It might have annoyed him , but business is business , and you have to hold your teeth clamped around Hollywood to keep from chewing on stray blondes . If there had been a lot of money involved , that would be different . But fifteen grand would n't be a lot of money to Eddie Mars . He was no two-bit chiseler like Brody . Geiger was dead and Carmen would have to find somep155other shady character to drink exotic blends of hooch with . I did n't suppose she would have any trouble . All she would have to do would be to stand on the corner for five minutes and look coy . I hoped that the next grifter who dropped the hook on her would play her a little more smoothly , a little more for the long haul rather than the quick touch . Mrs. Regan knew Eddie Mars well enough to borrow money from him . That was natural , if she played rouletteand was a good loser . Any gambling house owner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Apart from this they had an added bond of interest in Regan . He was her husband and he had gone off with Eddie Mars ' wife . Carol Lundgren , the boy killer with the limited vocabulary , was out of circulation for a long , long time , even if they did n't strap him in a chair over a bucket of acid . They would n't , because he would take a plea and save the county money . They all do when they do n't have the price of a big lawyer . Agnes Lozelle was in custody as a material witness . They would n't need her for that , if Carol took a plea , and if he pleaded guilty on arraignment , they would turn her loose . They would n't want to open up any angles on Geiger 's business , apart from which they had nothing on her . That left me . I had concealed a murder and suppressedevidence for twenty-four hours , but I was still at large and had a five-hundred-dollar check coming . The smart thing for me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whole mess . That being the obviously smart thing to do , I called Eddie Mars and told him I was coming down to Las Olindas that evening to talk to him . That was how smart I was . I got down there about nine , under a hard high October moon that lost itself in the top layers of a beach fog . The Cypress Club was at the far end of the town , a rambling frame mansion that had once been the summerresidence of a rich man named De Cazens , and later had been a hotel . It was now a big dark outwardly shabby place in a thick grove of wind-twisted Monterey cypresses , which gave it its name . It had enormous scrolled porches , turrets all over the place , stainedglasstrims around the big windows , big empty stables at the back , a general air of nostalgic decay . Eddie Mars had left the outside much as he had found it , instead of making it over to look like an MGM set . I left my car on a street with sputtering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gravel path to the main entrance . A doorman in a double-breasted guards coat let me into a huge dim silent lobby from which a white oak staircase curved majestically up to the darkness of an upper floor . I checked my hat and coat and waited , listening to music and confused voices behind heavy double doors . They seemed a long way off , and notP157quite of the same world as the building itself . Then the slim pasty-faced blond man who had been with Eddie Mars and the pug at Geiger 's place came through a door under the staircase , smiled at me bleakly and took me back with him along a carpeted hall to the boss 's office . This was a square room with a deep old bay window and a stone fireplace in which a fire of juniper logs burned lazily . It was wainscoted in walnut and had a frieze of faded damask above the paneling . The ceiling was high and remote . There was a smell of cold sea . Eddie Mars ' dark sheenless desk did n't belong in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ His carpet had a Florida suntan . There was a bartop radio in the corner and a Sevres china tea set on a copper tray beside a samovar . I wondered who that was for . There was a door in the corner that had a time lock on it . Eddie Mars grinned at me sociably and shook hands and moved his chin at the vault . " I 'm a pushover for a heist mob here except for that thing , " he said cheerfully . " The local johns drop in every morning and watch me ( ) open it . I have an arrangement with them . " " You hinted you had something for me , " I said . " What is it ? " " What 's your hurry ? Have a drink and sit down . " " No hurry at all . You and I have n't anything to talk about but business . ' " You 'll have the drink and like it , " he said . He mixed a couple and put mine down beside a red leather chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the side pocket of his midnight-blue dinner jacket , the thumb outside and the nail glistening . In dinner clothes he looked a little harder than in gray flannel , but he still looked like a horseman . We drank and nodded at each other . " Ever been here before ? " he asked . " During prohibition . I do n't get any kick out of gambling . " " Not with money , " he smiled . " You ought to look in tonight . One of your friends is outside betting the wheels . I hear she 's doing pretty well . Vivian Regan . " I sipped my drink and took one of his monogrammed cigarettes . " I kind of liked the way you handled that yesterday , ' ' he said . " You made me sore at the time but I could see afterwards how right you were . You and I ought to get along . How much do I owe you ? " " For doing what ? " " Still careful , eh ? I have my pipe line @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get them the way they happen , not the way you read them in the papers . " Ile showed me his large white teeth . " How much have you got ? " I asked . " You 're not talking money ? " " Information was the way I understood it . " " Information about what ? " " You have a short memory . Regan . "   " Oh , that . " He waved his glistening nails in the quiet light from one of those bronze lamps that shoot a beam at the ceiling . " I hear you got the information already . I felt I owed you a fee . I 'm used to paying for nice treatment . " " I did n't drive down here to make a touch . I get paid for what I do . Not much by your standards , but I make out . One customer at a time is a good rule . You did n't bump Regan off , did you ? " " No . Did you think I did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He laughed . " You 're kidding . " I laughed . " Sure , I 'm kidding . I never saw Regan , but I saw his photo . You have n't got the men for the work . And while we 're on that subject do n't send me any more gun punks with orders . I might get hysterical and blow one down . " He looked through his glass at the fire , set it down on the end of the desk and wiped his lips with a sheer lawn handkerchief . " You talk a good game , " he said . " But I dare say you can break a hundred and ten . You 're not really interested in Regan , are you ? " " No , not professionally . I have n't been asked to be . But I know somebody who would like to know where he is . " " She does n't give a damn , " he said . " I mean her father . "  | He wiped his lips again and looked at the handkerchiefalmost as if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his thick gray eyebrows close together and fingerer I the side of his weatherbeaten nose . " Geiger was trying to blackmail the General , " I said . " The General would n't say so , but I figure he was at least half scared Regan might be behind it . " Eddie Mars laughed . " Uh-uh . Geiger worked that one on everybody . It was strictly his own idea . He 'd get notes from people that looked legal  --  were legal , I dare say , except that he would n't have dared sue on them . He 'd present the notes , with a nice flourish , leavinghimself empty-handed . If he drew an ace , he had a prospect that scared and he went to work . If he did n't draw an ace , he just dropped the whole thing . " " Clever guy , " I said . " He dropped it all right . Dropped it and fell on it . How come you know all this ? " He shrugged impatiently . " I wish to Christ I did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Knowing other people 's business is the worst investment a man can make in my circle . Then if it was just Geiger you were after , you 're washed up on that angle . " " Washed up and paid off . " " I 'm sorry about that . I wish old Sternwood would hire himself a soldier like you on a straight salary , to keep those girls of his home at least a few nights a week . " " Why ? " His mouth looked sulky . " They 're plain trouble . P161Take the dark one . She 's a pain in the neck around here . If she loses , she plunges and I end up with a fistful of paper which nobody will discount at any price . She has no money of her own except an allowance and what 's in the old man 's will is a secret . If she wins , she takes my money home with her . " " You get it back the next night , " I said . " I get some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm loser . " He looked earnestly at me , as if that was important to me . I wondered why he thought it necessary to tell me at all . I yawned and finished my drink . " I 'm going out and look the joint over , " I said . " Yes , do . " He pointed to a door near the vault door . " That leads to a door behind the tables . " " I 'd rather go in the way the suckers enter . " " Okey . As you please . We 're friends , are n't we , soldier ? " " Sure . " I stood up and we shook hands . " Maybe I can do you a real favor some day , " he said . " You got it all from Gregory this time . " " So you own a piece of him too . " " Oh not that bad . We 're just friends . " I stared at him for a moment , then went over to the door I had come in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it open . " You do n't have anybody tailing me around in a gray Plymouth sedan , do you ? "  |p162His  eyes widened sharply . He looked jarred . " Hell , no . Why should I ? " " I could n't imagine , " I said , and went on out . I thought his surprise looked genuine enough to be believed . I thought he even looked a little worried . I could n't think of any reason for that . It was about ten-thirty when the little yellow-sashed Mexican orchestra got tired of playing a low-voiced , prettied-up rhumba that nobody was dancing to . The gourd player rubbed his finger tips together as if they were sore and got a cigarette into his mouth almost with the same movement . The other four , with a timed simultaneousstoop , reached under their chairs for glasses from which they sipped , smacking their lips and flashing their eyes . Tequila , their manner said . It was probably mineral water . The pretense was as wasted as the music . Nobody was looking at them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mars had changed it only as much as his business compelled him . No chromium glitter , no indirect lighting from behind angular cornices , no fused glass pictures , or chairs in violent leather and polished metal tubing , P163none of the pseudo-modernistic circus of the typical Hollywood night trap . The light was from heavy crystal chandeliers and the rose-damask panels of the wall were still the same rose damask , a little faded by time and darkened by dust , that had been matched long ago against the parquetry floor , of which only a small glasssmoothspace in front of the little Mexican orchestra showed bare . The rest was covered by a heavy old-rose carpeting that must have cost plenty . The parquetry was made of a dozen kinds of hardwood , from Burma teak through half a dozen shades of oak and ruddy wood that looked like mahogany , and fading out to the hard pale wild lilac of the California hills , all laid in elaboratepatterns , with the accuracy of a transit . It was still a beautiful room and now there was roulettein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ three tables close to the far wall . A low bronze railing joined them and made a fence around the croupiers . All three tables were working , but the crowd was at the middle one . I could see Vivian Regan 's black head close to it , from across the room where I was leaningagainst the bar and turning a small glass of bacardi around on the mahogany . The bartender leaned beside me watching the cluster of well-dressed people at the middle table . " She 's pickin " em tonight , right on the nose , " he said . " That tall blackheaded frail . " " Who is she ? "   " I would n't know her name . She comes here a lot though . " " The hell you would n't know her name . " " I just work here , mister , " he said without any animosity . " She 's all alone too . The guy was with her passed out . They took him out to his car . " " I 'll take her home , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , I wish you luck anyways . Should I gentle up that bacardi or do you like it the way it is ? " " I like it the way it is as well as I like it at all , " I said . " Me , I 'd just as leave drink croup medicine , " he said . The crowd parted and two men in evening clothes pushed their way out and I saw the back of her neck and her bare shoulders in the opening . She wore a lowcutdress of dull green velvet . It looked too dressy for the occasion . The crowd closed and hid all but her black head . The two men came across the room and leaned against the bar and asked for Scotch and soda . One of them was flushed and excited . He was mopping his face with a black-bordered handkerchief . The double satin stripes down the side of his trousers were wide enough for tire tracks . " Boy , I never saw such a run , " he said in a jittery voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that red . That 's roulette , boy , that 's roulette . " " It gives me the itch , " the other one said . " She 's betting a grand at a crack . She ca n't lose . " They putP165their beaks in their drinks , gurgled swiftly and went back . " So wise the little men are , " the barkeep drawled . " A grand a crack , huh . I saw an old horseface in Havana once  --  " The noise swelled over at the middle table and a chiseledforeign voice rose above it saying : " If you will just be patient a moment , madam . The table can not cover your bet . Mr. Mars will be here in a moment . " I left my bacardi and padded across the carpet . The little orchestra started to play a tango , rather loud . No one was dancing or intending to dance . I moved through a scattering of people in dinner clothes and full evening dress and sports clothes and business suits to the end table at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ behind it with their heads together and their eyes sideways . One moved a rake back and forth aimlessly over the empty layout . They were both staring at Vivian Regan . Her long lashes twitched and her face looked unnaturallywhite . She was at the middle table , exactly opposite the wheel . There was a disordered pile of money and chips in front of her . It looked like a lot of money . She spoke to the croupier with a cool , insolent , ill-tempered drawl . " What kind of a cheap outfit is this , I 'd like to know . Get busy and spin that wheel , highpockets . I want one more play and I 'm playing table stakes . You take it away fast enough I 've noticed , but when it comes to dishingit out you start to whine . " The croupier smiled a cold polite smile that had looked at thousands of boors and millions of fools . His tall dark disinterested manner was flawless . He said gravely : " The table can not cover your bet , madam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's your money , " the girl jeered . " Do n't you want it back ? " A man beside her tried to tell her something . She turned swiftly and spat something at him and be faded back into the crowd red-faced . A door opened in the paneling at the far end of the enclosed place made by the bronze railing . Eddie Mars came through the door with a set indifferent smile on his face , his hands thrust into the pockets of his dinner jacket , both thumbnails glistening outside . He seemed to like that pose . He strolled behind the croupiers and stopped at the corner of the middle table . He spoke with lazy calm , less politelythan the coupier . " Something the matter , Mrs. Regan ? " She turned her face to him with a sort of lunge . I saw the curve of her cheek stiffen , as if with an almost unbearableinner tautness . She did n't answer him . Eddie Mars said gravely : " If you 're not playing any more , you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ girl flushed . Her cheekbones stood out white in her face . Then she laughed off-key . She said bitterly :  | " One more play , Eddie . Everything I have on the red . I like red . It 's the color of blood . " Eddie Mars smiled faintly , then nodded and reached into his inner breast pocket . He drew out a large pinsealwallet with gold corners and tossed it carelessly along the table to the croupier . " Cover her bet in even thousands , " he said , " if no one objects to this turn of the wheel being just for the lady . " No one objected . Vivian Regan leaned down and pushed all her winnings savagely with both hands on to the large red diamond on the layout . The croupier leaned over the table without haste . He counted and stacked her money and chips , placed all but a few chips and bills in a neat pile and pushed the rest back off the layout with his rake . He opened Eddie Mars ' wallet and drew out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ counted six bills out , added them to the unbroken packet , put the four loose bills in the wallet and laid it aside as carelessly as if it had been a packet of matches . Eddie Mars did n't touch the wallet . Nobody moved except the croupier . He spun the wheel lefthanded and sent the ivory ball skittering along the upper edge with a casual flirt of his wrist . Then he drew his hands back and folded his arms . Vivian 's lips parted slowly until her teeth caught the light and glittered like knives . The ball drifted lazily down the slope of the wheel and bounced on the chromiumridges above the numbers . After a long time and then very suddenly motion left it with a dry click . The wheel slowed , carrying the ball around with it . The croupier did n't unfold his arms until the wheel had entirelyceased to revolve . " The red wins , " he said formally , without interest . The little ivory ball lay in Red 25 , the third number from the Double Zero . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The croupier lifted his rake and slowly pushed the stack of thousand-dollar bills across the layout , added them to the stake , pushed everything slowly out of the field of play . Eddie Mars smiled , put his wallet back in his pocket , turned on his heel and left the room through the door in the paneling . A dozen people let their breath out at the same time and broke for the bar . I broke with them and got to the far end of the room before Vivian had gathered up her winnings and turned away from the table . I went out into the large quiet lobby , got my hat and coat from the check girl , dropped a quarter in her tray and went out on the porch . The doorman loomed up beside me and said : " Can I get your car for you , sir ? " I said : " I 'm just going for a walk . " The scrollwork along the edge of the porch roof was wet with the fog . The fog dripped from the Monterey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ocean . You could see a scant dozen feetp169in any direction . I went down the porch steps and drifted off through the trees , following an indistinct path until I could hear the wash of the surf licking at the fog , low down at the bottom of the cliff . There was n't a gleam of light anywhere . I could see a dozen trees clearly at one time , another dozen dimly , then nothing at all but the fog . I circled to the left and drifted back towards the gravel path that went around to the stables where they parked the cars . When I could make out the outlines of the house I stopped . A little in front of me I had heard a man cough . My steps had n't made any sound on the soft moist turf . The man coughed again , then stifled the cough with a handkerchief or a sleeve . While he was still doingthat I moved forward closer to him . I made him out , a vague shadow close to the path . Something made me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turned his head . His face should have been a white blur when he did that . It was n't . It remained dark . There was a mask over it . I waited , behind the tree. 170 the big sleepP170Light steps , the steps of a woman , came along the invisiblepathway and the man in front of me moved for . ward and seemed to lean against the fog . I could n't see the woman , then I could see her indistinctly . The arrogantcarriage of her head seemed familiar . The man stepped out very quickly . The two figures blended in the fog , seemed to be part of the fog . There was dead silence for a moment . The man said : " This is a gun , lady . Gentle now . Sound carries in the fog . Just hand me the bag . " The girl did n't make a sound . I moved forward a step . Quite suddenly I could see the foggy fuzz on the man 's hat brim . The girl stood motionless . Then her breathing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ file on soft wood . " Yell , " the man said , " and I 'll cut you in half . " She did n't yell . She did n't move . There was a movementfrom him , and a dry chuckle . " It better be in here , " he said . A catch clicked and a fumbling sound came to me . The man turned and came towards my tree . When he had taken three or four steps he chuckled again . The chuckle was something out of my own memories . I reached a pipe out of my pocket and held it like a gun.  |p171I  called out softly : " Hi , Lanny . " The man stopped dead and started to bring his hand up . I said : " No . I told you never to do that , Lanny . You 're covered . " Nothing moved . The girl back on the path did n't move . I did n't move . Lanny did n't move . " Put the bag down between your feet , kid , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bent down . I jumped out and reached him still bent over . He straightened up against me breathing hard . His hands were empty . " Tell me I ca n't get away with it , " I said . I leaned against him and took the gun out of his overcoat pocket . " Somebody 's always giving me guns , " I told him . " I 'm weighted down with them till I walk all crooked . Beat it . " Our breaths met and mingled , our eyes were like the eyes of two tomcats on a wall . I stepped back . " On your way , Lanny . No hard feelings . You keep it quiet and I keep it quiet . Okey ? " " Okey , " he said thickly . The fog swallowed him . The faint sound of his steps and then nothing . I picked the bag up and felt in it and went towards the path . She still stood there motionless , a gray fur coat held tight around her throat with an unglovedhand on which a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Her dark parted hair was part of the darkness of the night . Her eyes too.  | " Nice work , Marlowe . Are you my bodyguard now ' ? " Her voice had a harsh note . " Looks that way . Here 's the bag . " She took it . I said : " Have you a car with you ? " She laughed . " I came with a man . What are you doing here ? " " Eddie Mars wanted to see me . " " I did n't know you knew him . Why ? " " I do n't mind telling you . He thought I was looking for somebody he thought had run away with his wife . " " Were you ? " " No . " " Then what did you come for ? " " To find out why he thought I was looking for somebodyhe thought had run away with his wife . " " Did you find out ? " " No . " " You leak information like a radio announcer , " she said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even if the man was my husband . I thought you were n't interested in that . " " People keep throwing it at me . " She clicked her teeth in annoyance . The incident of the masked man with the gun seemed to have made no impression on her at all . " Well , take me to the garage , " she said . " I have to look in at my escort . " We walked along the path and around a corner of the building and there was light ahead , then around anotherp173corner and came to a bright enclosed stable yard lit with two floodlights . It was still paved with brick and still sloped down to a grating in the middle . Cars glistenedand a man in a brown smock got up off a stool and came forward . " Is my boy friend still blotto ? " Vivian asked him carelessly . " I 'm afraid he is , miss . I put a rug over him and run the windows up . He 's okey , I guess . Just kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the man in the smock pulled the rear door open . On the wide back seat , loosely arranged , covered to the chin with a plaid robe , a man lay snoring with his mouth open . He seemed to be a big blond man who would hold a lot of liquor . " Meet Mr. Larry Cobb , " Vivian said . " Mister Cobb  --  Mister Marlowe . " I grunted . " Mr. Cobb was my escort , " she said . " Such a nice escort , Mr. Cobb . So attentive . You should see him sober . I should see him sober . Somebody should see him sober . I mean , just for the record . So it could becomea part of history , that brief flashing moment , soon buried in time , but never forgotten  --  when Larry Cobb was sober . " " Yeah , " I said . " I 've even thought of marrying him , " she went on in a high strained voice , as if the shock of the stick-up wasp174just beginning to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would come into my mind . We all have those spells . Lots of money , you know . A yacht , a place on Long Island , a place at Newport , a place at Bermuda , places dotted here and there all over the world probably  --  just a good Scotch bottle apart . And to Mr. Cobb a bottle of Scotch is not very far . " " Yeah , " I said . " Does he have a driver to take him home ? " " Do n't say yeah . ' It 's common . " She looked at me with arched eyebrows . The man in the smock was chewinghis lower lip hard . " Oh , undoubtedly a whole platoonof drivers . They probably do squads right in front of the garage every morning , buttons shining , harness gleaming , white gloves immaculate  --  a sort of West Point elegance about them . " " Well , where the hell is this driver ? " I asked . " He drove hisself tonight , " the man in the smock said , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somebody come down for him . " Vivian turned around and smiled at him as if he had just presented her with a diamond tiara . " That would be lovely , " she said . " Would you do that ? I really would n't want Mr. Cobb to die like that  --  with his mouth open . Someone might think he had died of thirst . " The man in the smock said : " Not if they sniffed him , miss . " She opened her bag and grabbed a handful of paperp175money and pushed it at him . " You 'll take care of him , I 'm sure . " " Jeeze , " the man said , pop-eyed . " I sure will , miss . " " Regan is the name , " she said sweetly . " Mrs. Regan . You 'll probably see me again . Have n't been here long , have you ? " " No 'm . " His hands were doing frantic things with the fistful of money he was holding . " You 'll get to love @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my arm . " Let 's ride in your car , Marlowe . " " It 's outside on the street . " " Quite all right with me , Marlowe . I love a nice walk in the fog . You meet such interesting people . " " Oh nuts , " I said . She held on to my arm and began to shake . She held me hard all the way to the car . She had stopped shaking by the time we reached it . I drove down a curving lane of trees on the blind side of the house . The lane opened on De Cazens Boulevard , the main drag of Las Olindas . We passed under the ancient sputtering arc lights and after a while there was a town , buildings , dead-looking stores , a service station with a light over a night bell , and at last a drugstore that was still open . " You better have a drink , " I said . She moved her chin , a point of paleness in the corner of the seat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A little black coffee and a smattering of rye would go well , " I said.  | " I could get as drunk as two sailors and love it . " I held the door for her and she got out close to me , brushing my cheek with her hair . We went into the drugstore . I bought a pint of rye at the liquor counter and carried it over to the stools and set it down on the cracked marble counter . " Two coffees , " I said . " Black , strong and made this year . " " You ca n't drink liquor in here , " the clerk said . He had a washed-out blue smock , was thin on top as to hair , had fairly honest eyes and his chin would never hit a wall before he saw it . Vivian Regan reached into her bag for a pack of cigarettes and shook a couple loose just like a man . She held them towards me . " It 's against the law to drink liquor in here , " the clerk said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to him . He drew two cups of coffee from a tarnished nickel urn and set them in front of us . He looked at the bottle of rye , muttered under his breath and said wearily : " Okey , I 'll watch the street while you pour it . " He went and stood at the display window with his back to us and his ears hanging out . " My heart 's in my mouth doing this , " I said , and unscrewed the top of the whiskey bottle and loaded the coffee . " The law enforcement in this town is terrific . All through prohibition Eddie Mars ' place was a nightp177club and they had two uniformed men in the lobby every night  --  to see that the guests did n't bring their own liquor instead of buying it from the house . " The clerk turned suddenly and walked back behind the counter and went in behind the little glass window of the prescription room . We sipped our loaded coffee . I looked at Vivian 's face in the mirror back of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful and wild . Her lips were red and harsh . " You have wicked eyes , " I said . " What 's Eddie Mars got on you ? " She looked at me in the mirror . " I took plenty away from him tonight at roulette  --  starting with five grand I borrowed from him yesterday and did n't have to use . " " That might make him sore . You think he sent that loogan after you ? " " What 's a loogan ? " " A guy with a gun . " " Are you a loogan ? " " Sure , " I laughed . " But strictly speaking a loogan is on the wrong side of the fence . " " I often wonder if there is a wrong side . " " We 're losing the subject . What has Eddie Mars got on you ? " " You mean a hold on me of some sort ? " " Yes . " Her lip curled . " Wittier , please , Marlowe . Much wittier . "  | " How @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witty . " " Not too well . He did n't get up today . You could at least stop questioning me . " " I remember a time when I thought the same about you . How much does the General know ? " " He probably knows everything . " " Norris would tell him ? " " No . Wilde , the District Attorney , was out to see him . Did you burn those pictures ? " " Sure . You worry about your little sister , do n't you  --  from time to time . " " I think she 's all I do worry about . I worry about Dad in a way , to keep things from him . " " He has n't many illusions , " I said , " but I suppose he still has pride . " " We 're his blood . That 's the hell of it . " She stared at me in the mirror with deep , distant eyes . " I do n't want him to die despising his own blood . It was always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Is it now ? " " I guess you think so . " " Not yours . You 're just playing the part . " She looked down . I sipped some more coffee and lit another cigarette for us . " So you shoot people , " she said quietly . " You 're a killer . " " Me ? How ? " " The papers and the police fixed it up nicely . But I do n't believe everything I read . "  | " Oh , you think I accounted for Geiger  --  or Brody  --  or both of them . " She did n't say anything . " I did n't have to , " I said . " I might have , I suppose , and got away with it . Neitherof them would have hesitated to throw lead at me . " " That makes you just a killer at heart , like all cops . " " Oh , nuts . " " One of those dark deadly quiet men who have no more feelings than a butcher has for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw you . " " You 've got enough shady friends to know different . " " They 're all soft compared to you . " " Thanks , lady . You 're no English muffin yourself . " " Let 's get out of this rotten little town . " I paid the check , put the bottle of rye in my pocket , and we left . The clerk still did n't like me . We drove away from Las Olindas through a series of little dank beach towns with shack-like houses built down on the sand close to the rumble of the surf and larger houses built back on the slopes behind . A yellow window shone here and there , but most of the houses were dark . A smell of kelp came in off the water and lay on the fog . The tires sang on the moist concrete of the boulevard . The world was a wet emptiness . We were close to Del Rey before she spoke to me for the first time since we left the drugstore . Her voice had a muffled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | " Drive down by the Del Rey beach club . I want to look at the water . It 's the next street on the left . " There was a winking yellow light at the intersection . I turned the car and slid down a slope with a high bluff on one side , interurban tracks to the right , a low straggle of lights far off beyond the tracks , and then very far off a glitter of pier lights and a haze in the sky over a city . That way the fog was almost gone . The road crossed the tracks where they turned to run under the bluff , then reached a paved strip of waterfront highway that borderedan open and uncluttered beach . Cars were parked along the sidewalk , facing out to sea , dark . The lights of the beach club were a few hundred yards away . I braked the car against the curb and switched the headlights off and sat with my hands on the wheel . Underthe thinning fog the surf curled and creamed , almost without sound , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of consciousness . " Move closer , " she said almost thickly . I moved out from under the wheel into the middle of the seat . She turned her body a little away from me as if to peer out of the window . Then she let herself fall backwards , without a sound , into my arms . Her head almost struck the wheel . Her eyes were closed , her face was dim . Then I saw that her eyes opened and flickered , the shine of them visible even in the darkness . " Hold me close , you beast , " she said . I put my arms around her loosely at first . Her hairp181had a harsh feeling against my face . I tightened my arms and lifted her up . I brought her face slowly up to my face . Her eyelids were flickering rapidly , like moth wings . I kissed her tightly and quickly . Then a long slow clinging kiss . Her lips opened under mine . Her body began to shake in my arms . " Killer , " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I strained her against me until the shivering of her body was almost shaking mine . I kept on kissing her . After a long time she pulled her head away enough to say : " Where do you live ? " " Hobart Arms . Franklin near Kenmore . " " I 've never seen it . " " Want to ? " " Yes , " she breathed . " What has Eddie Mars got on you ? " Her body stiffened in my arms and her breath made a harsh sound . Her head pulled back until her eyes , wide open , ringed with white , were staring at me . " So that 's the way it is , " she said in a soft dull voice . " That 's the way it is . Kissing is nice , but your father did n't hire me to sleep with you . " " You son of a bitch , " she said calmly , without moving . I laughed in her face . " Do n't think I 'm an icicle , " I said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have warm blood like the next guy . You 're easy to take  --  too damned easy . What has Eddie Mars got on you ? " " If you say that again , I 'll scream . " " Go ahead and scream . " She jerked away and pulled herself upright , far back in the corner of the car . " Men have been shot for little things like that , Mar-lowe . " " Men have been shot for practically nothing . The first time we met I told you I was a detective . Get it through your lovely head . I work at it , lady . I do n't play at it . " She fumbled in her bag and got a handkerchief out and bit on it , her head turned away from me . The tearingsound of the handkerchief came to me . She tore it with her teeth , slowly , time after time . " What makes you think he has anything on me ? " she whispered , her voice muffled by the handkerchief . " He lets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around to take it back for him . You 're not more than mildly surprised . You did n't even thank me for saving it for you . I think the whole thing was just some kind of an act . If I wanted to flatter myself , I 'd say it was at least partly for my benefit . " " You think he can win or lose as he pleases . " " Sure . On even money bets , four times out of five . " " Do I have to tell you I loathe your guts , Mister De-tective ? "   " You do n't owe me anything . I 'm paid off . " She tossed the shredded handkerchief out of the car window . " You have a lovely way with women . " " I liked kissing you . " " You kept your head beautifully . That 's so flattering . Should I congratulate you , or my father ? " " I liked kissing you . " Her voice became an icy drawl . " Take me away from here , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sure I 'd like to go home . " " You wo n't be a sister to me ? " " If I had a razor , I 'd cut your throat  --  just to see what ran out of it . " " Caterpillar blood , " I said . I started the car and turned it and drove back across the interurban tracks to the highway and so on into town and up to West Hollywood . She did n't speak to me . She hardly moved all the way back . I drove through the gates and up the sunken driveway to the porte-cochere of the big house . She jerked the car door open and was out of it before it had quite stopped . She did n't speak even then . I watched her back as she stood against the door after ringing the bell . The door opened and Norris looked out . She pushed past him quickly and was gone . The door banged shut and I was sitting there looking at it . I turned back down the driveway and home. 184 the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No gunman waiting under the potted palm to give me orders . I took the automatic elevator up to my floor and walked along the hallway to the tune of a muted radio behind a door . I needed a drink and was in a hurry to get one . I did n't switch the light on inside the door . I made straight for the kitchenette and brought up short in three or four feet . Something was wrong . Something on the air , a scent . The shades were down at the windows and the street light leaking in at the sides made a dim light in the room . I stood still and listened . The scent on the air was a perfume , a heavy cloying perfume . There was no sound , no sound at all . Then my eyes adjusted themselves more to the darkness and I saw there was something across the floor in front of me that should n't have been there . I backed , reached the wall switch with my thumb and flicked the light on . The bed was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was pressed into my pillow . Two bare arms curved up and the hands belonging to them were clasped on top of the blond head . Carmen Sternwood lay on her back , in my bed , giggling at me . The tawny wave of her hair was spread out on the pillow as if by a careful andP185artificial hand . Her slaty eyes peered at me and had the effect , as usual , of peering from behind a barrel . She smiled . Her small sharp teeth glinted . " Cute , are n't I ? " she said . I said harshly : " Cute as a Filipino on Saturday night . " I went over to a floor lamp and pulled the switch , went back to put off the ceiling light , and went across the room again to the chessboard on a card table under the lamp . There was a problem laid out on the board , a six-mover . I could n't solve it , like a lot of my problems . I reached down and moved a knight , then pulled my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this time the soft giggling went on from the bed , that sound that made me think of rats behind a wainscoting in an old house . " I bet you ca n't even guess how I got in . " I dug a cigarette out and looked at her with bleak eyes . " I bet I can . You came through the keyhole , just like Peter Pan . " " Who 's he ? " " Oh , a fellow I used to know around the poolroom . " She giggled . " You 're cute , are n't you ? " she said . I began to say : " About that thumb  --  " but she was ahead of me . I did n't have to remind her . She took her right hand from behind her head and started sucking the thumb and eyeing me with very round and naughty eyes . " I 'm all undressed , " she said , after I had smoked and stared at her for a minute .   " By God , " I said , " it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was groping for it . I almost had it , when you spoke . In another minute I 'd have said I bet you 're al ! undressed . ' I always wear my rubbers in bed myself , in case I wake up with a bad conscience and have to sneak away from it . " " You 're cute . " She rolled her head a little , kittenishly . Then she took her left hand from under her head and took hold of the covers , paused dramatically , and swept them aside . She was undressed all right . She lay there on the bed in the lamplight , as naked and glisteningas a pearl . The Sternwood girls were giving me both barrels that night . I pulled a shred of tobacco off the edge of my lower lip . " That 's nice , " I said . " But I 've already seen it all . Remember ? I 'm the guy that keeps finding you without any clothes on . " She giggled some more and covered herself up again . " Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . " The manager let me in . I showed him your card . I 'd stolen it from Vivian . I told him you told me to come here and wait for you . I was  --  I was mysterious . " She glowed with delight . " Neat , " I said . " Managers are like that . Now I know how you got in tell me how you 're going to go out . " She giggled . " Not going  --  not for a long time . . . . I like it here . You 're cute . "   " Listen , " I pointed my cigarette at her . " Do n't make me dress you again . I 'm tired . I appreciate all you 're offering me . It 's just more than I could possibly take . Doghouse Reilly never let a pal down that way . I 'm your friend . I wo n't let you down  --  in spite of yourself . You and I have to keep on being friends , and this is n't the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a nice little girl ? " She shook her head from side to side . " Listen , " I plowed on , " you do n't really care anything about me . You 're just showing how naughty you can be . But you do n't have to show me . I knew it already . I 'm the guy that found  --  " " Put the light out , " she giggled . I threw my cigarette on the floor and stamped on it . I took a handkerchief out and wiped the palms of my hands . I tried it once more . " It is n't on account of the neighbors , " I told her . " They do n't really care a lot . There 's a lot of stray broads in any apartment house and one more wo n't make the building rock . It 's a question of professional pride . You know  --  professional pride . I 'm working for your father . He 's a sick man , very frail , very helpless . He sort of trusts me not to pull @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Carmen ? " " Your name is n't Doghouse Reilly , " she said . " It 's Philip Marlowe . You ca n't fool me . " I looked down at the chessboard . The move with the knight was wrong . I put it back where I had moved it from . Knights had no meaning in this game . It was n't a game for knights . I looked at her again . She lay still now , her face pale against the pillow , her eyes large and dark and empty as rain barrels in a drought . One of her small five-fingered thumbless bands picked at the cover restlessly . There was a vague glimmer of doubt starting to get born in her somewhere . She did n't know about it yet . It 's so hard for women  --  even nice women  --  to realize that their bodies are not irresistible . I said : " I 'm going out in the kitchen and mix a drink . Want one ? " " Uh-huh . " Dark silent mystified eyes stared at me solemnly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noiselessly , like a cat in long grass stalking a young blackbird . " If you 're dressed when I get back , you 'll get the drink . Okey ? " Her teeth parted and a faint hissing noise came out of her mouth . She did n't answer me . I went out to the kitchenette and got out some Scotch and fizzwater and mixed a couple of highballs . I did n't have anything really exciting to drink , like nitroglycerin or distilled tiger 's breath . She had n't moved when I got back with the glasses . The hissing had stopped . Her eyes were dead again . Her lips started to smile at me . Then sheP189sat up suddenly and threw all the covers off her body and reached . " Gim me . " " When you 're dressed . Not until you 're dressed . " I put the two glasses down on the card table and sat down myself and lit another cigarette . " Go ahead . I wo n't watch you . " I looked away . Then I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It startled me into looking at her again . SF sat there naked , propped on her hands , her mouth open a little , her face like scraped bone . The hissing noise came tearing out of her mouth as if she had nothing n do with it . There was something behind her eyes , blank as they were , that I had never seen in a woman 's eyes . Then her lips moved very slowly and carefully , as if they were artificial lips and had to be manipulated with springs . She called me a filthy name . I did n't mind that . I did n't mind what she called me , what anybody called me . But this was the room I had to live in . It was all I had in the way of a home . In it was everything that was mine , that had any association for mea any past , anything that took the place of a family . No ! t much ; a few books , pictures , radio , chessmen , old let , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were they had all my memories.  | I could n't stand her in that room any longer . What she called me only reminded me of that . I said carefully : " I 'll give you three minutes to get dressed and out of here . If you 're not out by then , I 'll throw you out  --  by force . Just the way you are , naked . And I 'll throw your clothes after you into the hall . Now  --  get started . " Her teeth chattered and the hissing noise was sharp and animal . She swung her feet to the L oor and reached for her clothes on a chair beside the bed . She dressed . I watched her . She dressed with stiff awkward fingers  --  for a woman  --  but quickly at that . She was dressed in a little over two minutes . I timed it . She stood there beside the bed , holding a green bag tight against a fur-trimmed coat . She wore v rakish green hat crooked on her head . She stood there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ still like scraped bone , her eyes still empty and yet full of some jungle emotion . Then she walked quickly to the door and opened it and went out , without speaking , without lookingback . I heard the elevator lurch into motionk and move in the shaft . I walked to the windows and pulled the shades upland opened the windows wide . The night air came drifting in with a kind of stale sweetness that still remember red automobile exhausts and the streets of the city . I react , ed for my drink and drank it slowly . The apartment house door closed itself down below me . Steps tinkled on t hep191quiet sidewalk . A car started up not far away . It rushed off into the night with a rough clashing of gears . I went back to the bed and looked down at it . The imprint of her head was still in the pillow , of her small corrupt body still on the sheets . I put my empty glass down and tore the bed to pieces savagely . It was raining again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swung curtain of crystal beads . I got up feeling sluggish and tired and stood looking out of the windows , with a dark harsh taste of Sternwoods still in my mouth . I was as empty of life as a scarecrow 's pockets . I went out to the kitchenette and drank two cups of black coffee . You can have a hangover from other things than alcohol . I had one from women . Women made me sick . I shaved and showered and dressed and got my raincoatout and went downstairs and looked out of the front door . Across the street , a hundred feet up , a gray Plymouthsedan was parked . It was the same one that had tried to trail me around the day before , the same one that I had asked Eddie Mars about . There might be a cop in it , if a cop had that much time on his hands and wanted to waste it following me around . Or it might be a smoothie in the detective business trying to get a noseful of somebody else 's case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it might be the Bishop of Bermuda disapproving of my night life . I went out back and got my convertible from the garageand drove it around front past the gray Plymouth . There was a small man in it , alone . He started up after me . He worked better in the rain . He stayed close enough so that I could n't make a short block and leave that before he entered it , and he stayed back far enough so that other cars were between us most of the time . I drove down to the boulevard and parked in the lot next to my building and came out of there with my raincoat collar up and my hat brim low and the raindrops tapping icily at my face in between . The Plymouth was across the way at a fireplug . I walked down to the intersection and crossed with the green light and walked back , close to the edge of the sidewalk and the parked cars . The Plymouth had n't moved . Nobody got out of it . I reached it and jerked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright-eyed man was pressed back into the corner behind the wheel . I stood and looked in at him , the rain thumping my back . His eyes blinked behind the swirling smoke of a cigarette . His hands tapped restlessly on the thin wheel . I said : " Ca n't you make your mind up ? " He swallowed and the cigarette bobbed between hisp193lips . " I do n't think I know you , " he said , in a tight little voice . " Marlowe 's the name . The guy you 've been trying to follow around for a couple of days . " " I ai n't following anybody , doc . " " This jaloppy is . Maybe you ca n't control it . Have it your own way . I 'm now going to eat breakfast in the coffee shop across the street , orange juice , bacon and eggs , toast , honey , three or four cups of coffee and a toothpick . I am then going up to my office , which is on the seventh floor of the building @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worrying you beyond endurance , drop up and chew it over . I 'll only be oiling my machine gun . " I left him blinking and walked away . Twenty minutes later I was airing the scrubwoman 's Soiree d'Amour out of my office and opening up a thick rough envelope addressedin a fine old-fashioned pointed handwriting . The envelope contained a brief formal note and a large mauve check for five hundred dollars , payable to Philip Marlowe and signed , Guy de Brisay Sternwood , by VincentNorris . That made it a nice morning . I was making out a bank slip when the buzzer told me somebody had entered my two by four reception room . It was the little man from the Plymouth . " Fine , " I said . " Come in and shed your coat . " He slid past me carefully as I held the door , as carefullyas though he feared I might plant a kick in his minute buttocks . We sat down and faced each other across the desk . He was a very small man , not more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a butcher 's thumb . He had tight brilliant eyes that wanted to look hard , and looked as hard as oysters on the half shell . He wore a double-breasted dark gray suit that was too wide in the shoulders and bad too much lapel . Over this , open , an Irish tweed coat with some badly worn spots . A lot of foulard tie bulged out and was rainspottedabove his crossed lapels . " Maybe you know me , " he said . " I 'm Harry Jones . " I said I did n't know him . I pushed a flat tin of cigarettesat him . His small neat fingers speared one like a trout taking the fly . He lit it with the desk lighter and waved his hand . " I been around , " he said . " Know the boys and such . Used to do a little liquor-running down from Hueneme Point . A tough racket , brother . Riding the scout car with a gun in your lap and a wad on your hip that would choke a coal shute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law before we hit Beverly Hills . A tough racket . " " Terrible , " I said . He leaned back and blew smoke at the ceiling from the small tight corner of his small tight mouth . " Maybe you do n't believe me , " he said . " Maybe I do n't , " I said . " And maybe I do . And then again maybe I have n't bothered to make my mind up . Just what is the build-up supposed to do to me ? "  | " Nothing , " he said tartly . " You 've been following me around for a couple of days , " I said . " Like a fellow trying to pick up a girl and lacking the last inch of nerve . Maybe you 're selling insurance . Maybe you knew a fellow called Joe Brody . That 's a lot of maybes , but I have a lot on hand in my business . " His eyes bulged and his lower lip almost fell in his lap . " Christ , how 'd you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Shake your business up and pour it . I have n't got all day . " The brightness of his eyes almost disappeared between the suddenly narrowed lids . There was silence . The rain pounded down on the flat tarred roof over the MansionHouse lobby below my windows . His eyes opened a little , shined again , and his voice was full of thought . " I was trying to get a line on you , sure , " he said . " I 've got something to sell  --  cheap , for a couple of C notes . How 'd you tie me to Joe ? " I opened a letter and read it . It offered me a six months ' correspondence course in fingerprinting at a special professional discount . I dropped it into the waste basket and looked at the little man again . " Do n't mind me . I was just guessing . You 're not a cop . You do n't belong to Eddie Mars outfit . I asked him last night . I could n't think of anybody else but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in me . " " Jesus , " he said and licked his lower lip . His face had turned white as paper when I mentioned Eddie Mars . His mouth drooped open and his cigarette hung to the corner of it by some magic , as if it had grown there . " Aw , you 're kidding me , " he said at last , with the sort of smile the operating room sees . " All right . I 'm kidding you . " I opened another letter . This one wanted to send me a daily newsletter from Washington , all inside stuff , straight from the cookhouse . " I suppose Agnes is loose , " I added . " Yeah . She sent me . You interested ? " " Well  --  she 's a blonde . " " Nuts . You made a crack when you were up there that night  --  the night Joe got squibbed off . Something about Brody must have known something good about the Sternwoods or he would n't have taken the chance on that picture he sent them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was it ? " " That 's what the two hundred bucks pays for . " I dropped some more fan mail into the basket and lit myself a fresh cigarette . " We got ta get out of town , " he said . " Agnes is a nice girl . You ca n't hold that stuff on her . It 's not so easy for a dame to get by these days . " " She 's too big for you , " I said . " She 'll roll on you and smother you . " " That 's kind of a dirty crack , brother , " he said with something that was near enough to dignity to make me stare at him.  |p197I  said : " You 're right . I 've been meeting the wrong kind of people lately . Let 's cut out the gabble and get down to cases . What have you got for the money ? " " Would you pay it ? " " If it does what ? " " If it helps you find Rusty Regan . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Says you . Want to hear it or not ? " " Go ahead and chirp . I 'll pay for anything I use . Two C notes buys a lot of information in my circle . " " Eddie Mars had Regan bumped off , " he said calmly , and leaned back as if he had just been made a vicepresident . I waved a hand in the direction of the door . " I would n't even argue with you , " I said . " I would n't waste the oxygen . On your way , small size . " He leaned across the desk , white lines at the corners of his mouth . He snubbed his cigarette out carefully , over and over again , without looking at it . From behind a communicating door came the sound of a typewriter clacking monotonously to the bell , to the shift , line after line . " I 'm not kidding , " he said . " Beat it . Do n't bother me . I have work to do . " " No you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ai n't that easy . I came here to speak my piece and I 'm speaking it . I knew Rusty myself . Not well , well enough to say How 's a boy ? ' and he 'd answer me or he would n't , according to how he felt . A nice guy though . I always liked him . He was sweet on a singer named Mona Grant . Then she changed her name to Mars . Rusty got sore and married a rich dame that hung around the joints like she could n't sleep well at home . You know all about her , tall , dark , enough looks for a Derby winner , but the type would put a lot of pressure on a guy . High-strung . Rusty would n't get along with her . But Jesus , he 'd get along with her old man 's dough , would n't he ? That 's what you think . This Regan was a cockeyed sort of buzzard . Ile had long-range eyes . He was looking over into the next valley all the time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he gave a damn about dough . And coming from me , brother , that 's a compliment . " The little man was n't so dumb after all . A three for a quarter grifter would n't even think such thoughts , much less know how to express them . I said : " So he ran away . " " He started to run away , maybe . With this girl Mona . She was n't living with Eddie Mars , did n't like his rackets . Especially the side lines , like blackmail , bent cars , hideouts for hot boys from the east , and so on . The talk was Regan told Eddie one night , right out in the open , that if he ever messed Mona up in any criminal rap , he 'd be around to see him . " " Most of this is on the record , Harry , " I said . " You ca n't expect money for that . " " I 'm coming to what is n't . So Regan blew . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whiskeyand staring at the wall . He do n't talk much any more . He 'd give me a bet now and then , which was what I was there for , to pick up bets for Puss Walgreen . " " I thought he was in the insurance business . " " That 's what it says on the door . I guess he 'd sell you insurance at that , if you tramped on him . Well , about the middle of September I do n't see Regan any more . I do n't notice it right away . You know how it is . A guy 's there and you see him and then he ai n't there and you do n't not see him until something makes you think of it . What makes me think about it is I hear a guy say laughingthat Eddie Mars ' woman lammed out with Rusty Regan and Mars is acting like he was best man , instead of being sore . So I tell Joe Brody and Joe was smart . " " Like hell he was , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smart . He 's out for the dough . He gets to figuring could he get a line somehow on the two lovebirds he could maybe collect twice  --  once from Eddie Mars and once from Regan 's wife . Joe knew the family a little . " " Five grand worth , " I said . " He nicked them for that a while back . " " Yeah ? " Harry Jones looked mildly surprised . " Agnes ought to of told me that . There 's a frail for you . Always holding out . Well , Joe and me watch the papers and we do n't see anything , so we know old Sternwood has a blanket on it . Then one day I see Lash Canino in Vardi 's . Know him ? " I shook my head . " There 's a boy that is tough like some guys think they are tough . He does a job for Eddie Mars when Mars needs him  --  trouble-shooting . He 'd bump a guy off betweendrinks . When Mars do n't need him he do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L.A. Well it might be something and it might not . Maybe they got a line on Regan and Mars has just been sitting back with a smile on his puss , waiting for the chance . Then again it might be something else entirely . Anyway I tell Joe and Joe gets on Canino 's tail . He can tail . Me , I 'm no good at it . I 'm giving that one away . No charge . And Joe tails Canino out to the Sternwood place and Canino parks outside the estate and a car come up beside him with a girl in it . They talk for a while and Joe thinks the girl passes something over , like maybe dough . The girl beats it . It 's Regan 's wife . Okey , she knows Canino and Canino knows Mars . So Joe figures Canino knows something about Regan and is trying to squeeze a little on the side for himself . Canino blows and Joe loses him . End of Act One . " " What does this Canino look like ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes , and always wears brown clothes and a brown hat . Even wears a brown suede raincoat . Drives a brown coupe . Everythingbrown for Mr. Canino . " " Let 's have Act Two , " I said .   " Without some dough that 's all . " " I do n't see two hundred bucks in it . Mrs. Regan married an ex-bootlegger out of the joints . She 'd know other people of his sort . She knows Eddie Mars well . If she thought anything had happened to Regan , Eddie would be the very man she 'd go to , and Canino might be the man Eddie would pick to handle the assignment . Is that all you have ? " " Would you give the two hundred to know where Eddie 's wife is ? " the little man asked calmly . He had all my attention now . I almost cracked the arms of my chair leaning on them . " Even if she was alone ? " Harry Jones added in a soft , rather sinister tone . " Even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was being kept now about forty miles from L.A. in a hideout  --  so the law would keep on thinking she had dusted with him ? Would you pay two hundred bucks for that , shamus ? " I licked my lips . They tasted dry and salty . " I think I would , " I said . " Where ? " " Agnes found her , " he said grimly . " Just by a lucky break . Saw her out riding and managed to tail her home . Agnes will tell you where that is  --  when she 's holding the money in her hand . " I made a hard face at him . " You could tell the coppersfor nothing , Harry . They have some good wreckers down at Central these days . If they killed you trying , they still have Agnes . "   " Let ' em try , " he said . " I ai n't so brittle . " " Agnes must have something I did n't notice . " " She 's a grifter , shamus . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sell each other out for a nickel . Okey . See can you make me . " He reached for another of my cigarettes , placed it neatly between his lips and lit it with a match the way I do myself , missing twice on his thumbnailand then using his foot . He puffed evenly and stared at me level-eyed , a funny little hard guy I could have thrown from home plate to second base . A small man in a big man 's world . There was something I liked about him . " I have n't pulled anything in here , " he said steadily . " I come in talking two C 's . That 's still the price . I come because I thought I 'd get a take it or leave it , one right gee to another . Now you 're waving cops at me . You ought a be ashamed of yourself . " I said : " You 'll get the two hundred  --  for that information . I have to get the money myself first . " He stood up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight around his chest . " That 's okey . After dark is better anyway . It 's a leery job  --  buckin ' guys like Eddie Mars . But a guy has to eat . The book 's been pretty dull lately . I think the big boys have told Puss Walgreen to move on . Suppose you come over there to the office , Fulwider Building , Western and Santa Monica , four-twenty-eight at the back . You bring the money , I 'll take you to Agnes . "  | " Ca n't you tell me yourself ? I 've seen Agnes . " " I promised her , " he said simply . He buttoned his overcoat , cocked his hat jauntily , nodded again and strolled to the door . He went out . His steps died along the hall . I went down to the bank and deposited my five-hundred-dollarcheck and drew out two hundred in currency . I went upstairs again and sat in my chair thinkingabout Harry Jones and his story . It seemed a little too pat . It had the austere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Captain Gregory ought to have been able to find Mona Mars , if she was that close to his beat . Supposing , that is , he had tried . I thought about it most of the day . Nobody came into the office . Nobody called me on the phone . It kept on raining . At seven the rain had stopped for a breathing spell , butthe gutters were still flooded . On Santa Monica the water was level with the sidewalk and a thin film of it washed over the top of the curbing . A traffic cop in shining black rubber from boots to cap sloshed through the flood on his way from the shelter of a sodden awn- ing . My rubber heels slithered on the sidewalk as I turned into the narrow lobby of the Fulwider Building . A single drop light burned far back , beyond an open , once gilt elevator . There was a tarnished and wellmissedspittoon on a gnawed rubber mat . A case of false teeth hung on the mustard-colored wall like a fuse box in a screen porch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the building directory beside the case of teeth . Numberswith names and numbers without names . Plenty of vacancies or plenty of tenants who wished to remain anonymous . Painless dentists , shyster detective agencies , small sick businesses that had crawled there to die , mail order schools that would teach you how to become a railroad clerk or a radio technician or a screen writer  --  if the postal inspectors did n't catch up with them first . A nasty building . A building in which the smell of stale cigar butts would be the cleanest odor . An old man dozed in the elevator , on a ramshackle stool , with a burst-out cushion under him . His mouth was open , his veined temples glistened in the weak light . He wore a blue uniform coat that fitted him the way a stall fits a horse . Under that gray trousers with frayed cuffs , white cotton socks and black kid shoes , one of which was slit across a bunion . On the stool he slept miserably , waiting for a customer . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prompting me , found the fire door and pulled it open . The fire stairs had n't been swept in a month . Bums had slept on them , P205eaten on them , left crusts and fragments of greasy newspaper , matches , a gutted imitation-leather pocketbook . In a shadowy angle against the scribbled wall a pouched ring of pale rubber had fallen and had not been disturbed . A very nice building . I came out at the fourth floor sniffing for air . The hallway had the same dirty spittoon and frayed mat , the same mustard walls , the same memories of low tide . I went down the line and turned a corner . The name : " L. D. Walgreen  --  Insurance , " showed on a dark pebbledglass door , on a second dark door , on a third behindwhich there was a light . One of the dark doors said : " Entrance . " A glass transom was open above the lighted door . Through it the sharp birdlike voice of Harry Jones . spoke , saying : " Canino ? . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Sure . " I froze . The other voice spoke . It had a heavy purr , . like a small dynamo behind a brick wall . It said : " I thought you would . " There was a vaguely sinister note in that voice . A chair scraped on linoleum , steps sounded , the transomabove me squeaked shut . A shadow melted from behind the pebbled glass . I went back to the first of the three doors marked with the name Walgreen . I tried it cautiously . It was locked . It moved in a loose frame , an old door fitted many years.  | past , made of half-seasoned wood and shrunken now . I reached my wallet out and slipped the thick hard windowof celluloid from over my driver 's license . A burglar'stool the law had forgotten to proscribe . I put my gloves on , leaned softly and lovingly against the door and pushed the knob hard away from the frame . I pushed the celluloid plate into the wide crack and felt for the slope of the spring lock . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breaking . I hung there motionless , like a lazy fish in the water . Nothing happened inside . I turned the knob and pushed the door back into darkness . I shut it behind me as carefully as I had opened it . The lighted oblong of an uncurtained window faced me , cut by the angle of a desk . On the desk a hooded typewriter took form , then the metal knob of a communicatingdoor . This was unlocked . I passed into the second of the three offices . Rain rattled suddenly against the closed window . Under its noise I crossed the room . A tight fan of light spread from an inch opening of the door into the lighted office . Everything very convenient . I walked like a cat on a mantel and reached the hinged side of the door , put an eye to the crack and saw nothing but light against the angle of the wood . The purring voice was now saying quite pleasantly : " Sure , a guy could sit on his fanny and crab what another guy done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you go to see this peeper . Well , that was your mistake . Eddie do n't like it . The peeper told Eddie some guy in a grayp207Plymouth was tailing him . Eddie naturally wants to know who and why , see . " Harry Jones laughed lightly . " What makes it his business ? " " That do n't get you no place . " " You know why I went to the peeper . I already told you . Account of Joe Brody 's girl . She has to blow and she 's shatting on her uppers . She figures the peeper can get her some dough . I do n't have any . " The purring voice said gently : " Dough for what ? Peepers do n't give that stuff out to punks . " " He could raise it . He knows rich people . " Harry Jones laughed , a brave little laugh . " Do n't fuss with me , little man . " The purring voice had an edge , like sand in the bearings . " Okey , okey . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ screwy kid done it all right , but the night it happened this Marlowe was right there in the room . " " That 's known , little man . He told it to the law . " " Yeah  --  here 's what is n't . Brody was trying to peddlea nudist photo of the young Sternwood girl . Marlowegot wise to him . While they were arguing about it the young Sternwood girl dropped around herself  --  with a gat . She took a shot at Brody . She lets one fly and breaks a window . Only the peeper did n't tell the coppersabout that . And Agnes did n't neither . She figures it 's railroad fare for her not to . " " This ai n't got anything to do with Eddie ? "   " Show me how . " " Where 's this Agnes at ? " " Nothing doing . " " You 'll tell me , little man . Here , or in the back room where the boys pitch dimes against the wall . " " She 's my girl now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the middle for anybody . " A silence followed . I listened to the rain lashing the windows . The smell of cigarette smoke came through the crack of the door . I wanted to cough . I bit hard on a handkerchief . The purring voice said , still gentle : " From what I hear this blonde broad was just a shill for Geiger . I 'll talk it over with Eddie . How much you tap the peeper for ? " " Two centuries . " " Get it ? " Harry Jones laughed again . " I 'm seeing him tomorrow . I have hopes . " " Where 's Agnes ? " " Listen  --  " " Where 's Agnes ? " Silence . " Look at it , little man . " I did n't move . I was n't wearing a gun . I did n't have to see through the crack of the door to know that a gun was what the purring voice was inviting Harry Jones to look at . But I did n't think Mr. Canino would do any.  |p209thing  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm looking at it , " Harry Jones said , his voice squeezed tight as if it could hardly get past his teeth . " And I do n't see anything I did n't see before . Go ahead and blast and see what it gets you . " " A Chicago overcoat is what it would get you , little man . " Silence . " Where 's Agnes ? " Harry Jones sighed . " Okey , " he said wearily . " She 's in an apartment house at 28 Court Street , up on Bunker Hill . Apartment 30L I guess I 'm yellow all right . Why should I front for that twist ? " " No reason . You got good sense . You and me 'll go out and talk to her . All I want is to find out is she dummyingup on you , kid . If it 's the way you say it is , everything is jakeloo . You can put the bite on the peeper and be on your way . No hard feelings ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feelings , Canino . " " Fine . Let 's dip the bill . Got a glass ? " The purring voice was now as false as an usherette 's eyelashes and as slippery as a watermelon seed . A drawer was pulled open . Something jarred on wood . A chair squeaked . A scuffing sound on the floor . " This is bond stuff , " the purring voice said . There was a gurgling sound . " Moths in your ermine , as the ladies say . " Harry Jones said softly : " Success . "  |p210I  heard a short sharp cough . Then a violent retching . There was a small thud on the floor , as if a thick glass had fallen . My fingers curled against my raincoat . The purring voice said gently : " You ai n't sick from just one drink , are you , pal ? " Harry Jones did n't answer . There was labored brea thingfor a short moment . Then thick silence folded down . Then a chair scraped . " So long , little man , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the wedge of light died at my feet , a door opened and closed quietly . The steps faded , leisurelyand assured . I stirred around the edge of the door and pulled it wide and looked into blackness relieved by the dim shine of a window . The corner of a desk glittered faintly . A hunched shape took form in a chair behind it . In the close air there was a heavy clogged smell , almost a perfume . I went across to the corridor door and listened . I heard the distant clang of the elevator . I found the light switch and light glowed in a dusty glass bowl hanging from the ceiling by three brass chains . Harry Jones looked at me across the desk , his eyes wide open , his face frozen in a tight spasm , the skin bluish . His small dark head was tilted to one side . He sat uprightagainst the back of the chair . A street-car bell clanged at an almost infinite distance and the sound came buffeted by innumerable walls . A brown half pint of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jones ' glass glinted against a castor of the desk . The second glass was gone . I breathed shallowly , from the top of my lungs , and bent above the bottle . Behind the charred smell of the bourbon another odor lurked , faintly , the odor of bitter almonds . Harry Jones dying had vomited on his coat . That made it cyanide . I walked around him carefully and lifted a phone book from a hook on the wooden frame of the window . I let it fall again , reached the telephone as far as it would go from the little dead man . I dialed information . The voice answered . " Can you give me the phone number of Apartment 301 , 28 Court Street ? " " One moment , please . " The voice came to me borne on the smell of bitter almonds . A silence . " The numberis Wentworth 2528 . It is listed under Glendower Apartments . " I thanked the voice and dialed the number . The bell rang three times , then the line opened . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A burly male voice said : " Hello . " " Is Agnes there ? " " No Agnes here , buddy . What number you want ? " " Wentworth two-five-two-eight . " " Right number , wrong gal . Ai n't that a shame ? " The voice cackled . I hung up and reached for the phone book again and looked up the Wentworth Apartments . I dialed the manager'snumber . I had a blurred vision of Mr. Canino driving fast through rain to another appointment with death . " Glendower Apartments . Mr. Schiff speaking . " " This is Wallis , Police Identification Bureau . Is therea girl named Agnes Lozelle registered in your place ? " " Who did you say you were ? " I told him again . " If you give me your number , I 'll  --  " " Cut the comedy , " I said sharply , " I 'm in a hurry . Is there or is n't there ? " " No . There is n't . " The voice was as stiff as a breadstick . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the flop ? " " Say , this is n't any flop  --  " " Oh , can it , can it ! " I rapped at him in a police voice . " You want me to send the vice squad over there and shake the joint down ? I know all about Bunker Hill apartment houses , mister . Especially the ones that have phone numbers listed for each apartment . " " Hey , take it easy , officer . I 'll co-operate . There 's acouple of blondes here , sure . Where is n't there ? Ihad n't noticed their eyes much . Would yours be alone ? " " Alone , or with a little chap about five feet three , a hundred and ten , sharp black eyes , wears doublebreasteddark gray suit and Irish tweed overcoat , grayP213hat . My information is Apartment 301 , but all I get there is the big razzoo . " " Oh , she ai n't there . There 's a couple of car salesmenliving in three-o-one . " " Thanks , I 'll drop around . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come to my place , di-rect ? " " Much obliged , Mr. Schiff . " I hung up . I wiped sweat off my face . I walked to the far corner of the office and stood with my face to the wall , patted it with a hand . I turned around slowly and looked across at little Harry Jones grimacing in his chair . " Well , you fooled him , Harry , " I said out loud , in a voice that sounded queer to me . " You lied to him and you drank your cyanide like a little gentleman . You died like a poisoned rat , Harry , but you 're no rat to me . " I had to search him . It was a nasty job . His pockets yielded nothing about Agnes , nothing that I wanted at all . I did n't think they would , but I had to be sure . Mr. Canino might be back . Mr. Canino would be the kind of self-confident gentleman who would not mind returning to the scene of his crime . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The phone bell rang jarringly down on the baseboard . I listened to it , my jaw muscles drawn into a knot , aching . Then I shut the door and put the light on again and went across to it . " Yeah ? "  |p214A  woman 's voice . Her voice . " Is Harry around ? " " Not for a minute , Agnes . " She waited a while on that . Then she said slowly : " Who 's talking ? " " Marlowe , the guy that 's trouble to you . " " Where is he ? " sharply . " I came over to give him two hundred bucks in returnfor certain information . The offer holds . I have the money . Where are you ? " " Did n't he tell you ? " " No . " " Perhaps you 'd better ask him . Where is he ? " " I ca n't ask him . Do you know a man named Ca-nino ? " Her gasp came as clearly as though she had been beside me . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I asked . " I  --  I want it pretty bad , mister . " " All right then . Tell me where to bring it . " " I  --  I  --  " Her voice trailed off and came back with a panic rush . " Where 's Harry ? " " Got scared and blew . Meet me somewhere  --  anywhereat all  --  I have the money . " " I do n't believe you  --  about Harry . It 's a trap . " " Oh stuff . I could have had Harry hauled in long ago . There is n't anything to make a trap for . Canino got a line on Harry somehow and he blew . I want quiet , you want quiet , Harry wants quiet . " Harry already hadp215it . Nobody could take it away from him . " You do n't think I 'd stooge for Eddie Mars , do you , angel ? " " No-o , I guess not . Not that . I 'll meet you in half an hour . Beside Bullocks Wilshire , the east @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I said . I dropped the phone in its cradle . The wave of almond odor flooded me again , and the sour smell of vomit . The little dead man sat silent in his chair , beyond fear , beyondchange . I left the office . Nothing moved in the dingy corridor . No pebbled glass door had light behind it . I went down the fire stairs to the second floor and from there looked down at the lighted roof of the elevator cage . I pressed the button . Slowly the car lurched into motion . I ran down the stairs again . The car was above me when I walked out of the building . It was raining hard again . I walked into it with the heavy drops slapping my face . When one of them touched my tongue I knew that my mouth was open and the ache at the side of my jaws told me it was open wide and strained back , mimicking the rictus of death carved upon the face of Harry Jones. 216 the big sleep " Give me the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under her voice and the rain pounded above it . The violet light at the top of Bullocks green-tinged tower was far above us , serene and withdrawn from the dark , dripping city . Her black-gloved hand reached out and I put the bills in it . She bent over to count them under the dim light of the dash . A bag clicked open , clicked shut . She let a spent breath die on her lips . She leaned towards me . " I 'm leaving , copper . I 'm on my way . This is a getawaystake and God how I need it . What happened to Harry ? " " I told you he ran away . Canino got wise to him somehow . Forget Harry . I 've paid and I want my informa-tion . " " You 'll get it . Joe and I were out riding Foothill Boulevard Sunday before last . It was late and the lights coming up and the usual mess of cars . We passed a brown coupe and I saw the girl who was driving it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man . The girl was a blonde . I 'd seen her before . She was Eddie Mars ' wife . The guy was Canino . You would n't forget either of them , if you ever saw them . Joe tailed the coupeP217from in front . He was good at that . Canino , the watchdog , was taking her out for air . A mile or so east of Realito a road turns towards the foothills . That 's orange country to the south but to the north it 's as bare as hell 's back yard and smack up against the hills there 's a cyanideplant where they make the stuff for fumigation . Just off the highway there 's a small garage and paintshoprun by a gee named Art Huck . Hot car drop , likely . There 's a frame house beyond this , and beyond the house nothing but the foothills and the bare stone outcrop and the cyanide plant a couple of miles on . That 's the place where she 's holed up . They turned off on this road and Joe swung @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the road where the frame house was . We sat there half an hour looking through the cars going by . Nobody came back out . When it was quite dark Joe sneaked up there and took a look . He said there were lights in the house and a radio was going and just the one car out in front , the coupe . So we beat it . " She stopped talking and I listened to the swish of tires on Wilshire . I said : " They might have shifted quarters since then but that 's what you have to sell  --  that 's what you have to sell . Sure you knew her ? " " If you ever see her , you wo n't make a mistake the second time . Good-by , copper , and wish me luck . I got a raw deal . " " Like hell you did , " I said , and walked away across the street to my own car . P218The gray Plymouth moved forward , gathered speed , and darted around the corner on to Sunset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and with it blonde Agnes wiped herself off the slate for good , so far as I was concerned . Three men dead , Geiger , Brody and Harry Jones , and the woman went riding off in the rain with my two hundred in her bag and not a mark on her . I kicked my starter and drove on downtown to eat . I ate a good dinner . Forty miles in the rain is a hike , and I hoped to make it a round trip . I drove north across the river , on into Pasadena , through Pasadena and almost at once I was in orange groves . The tumbling rain was solid white spray in the headlights . The windshield wiper could hardly keel ) the glass clear enough to see through . But not even the drenched darkness could hide the flawless lines of the orange trees wheeling away like endless spokes into the night . Cars passed with a tearing hiss and a wave of dirty spray . The highway jerked through a little town that was all packing houses and sheds , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dropped away to the south and the road climbed and it was cold and to the north the black foothills crouched closer and sent a bitter wind whipping down their flanks . Then faintly out of the dark two yellow vapor lights glowed high up in the air and a neon sign between them said : " Welcome to Realito. "  |p219Frame  houses were spaced far back from a wide main street , then a sudden knot of stores , the lights of a drugstore behind fogged glass , the fly-cluster of cars in front of the movie theater , a dark bank on a corner with a clock sticking out over the sidewalk and a group of people standing in the rain looking at its windows , as if they were some kind of a show . I went on . Empty fields closed in again . Fate stage-managed the whole thing . Beyond Realito , just about a mile beyond , the highway took a curve and the rain fooled me and I went too close to the shoulder . My right front tire let go with an angry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with it . I jammed the car to a stop , half on the pavement , half on the shoulder , got out and flashed a spotlight around . I had two flats and one spare . The flat butt of a heavy galvanized tack stared at me from the front tire . The edge of the pavementwas littered with them . They had been swept off , but not far enough off . I snapped the flash off and stood there breathing rain and looking up a side road at a yellow light . It seemed to come from a skylight . The skylight could belong to a garage , the garage could be run by a man named Art Huck , and there could be a frame house next door to it . I tucked my chin down in my collar and started towards it , then went back to unstrap the license holder from the steering post and put it in my pocket . I leaned lower under the wheel . Behind ap220weighted flap , directly under my right leg as I sat in the car , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . One belonged to Eddie Mars ' boy Lanny and one belonged to me . I took Lanny 's . It would have had more practice than mine . I stuck it nose down in an inside pocket and started up the side road . The garage was a hundred yards from the highway . It showed the highway a blank side wall . I played the flash on it quickly . " Art Huck  --  Auto Repairs and Painting . " I chuckled , then Harry Jones ' face rose up in front of me , and I stopped chuckling . The garage doors were shut , but there was an edge of light under them and a thread of light where the halves met . I went on past . The frame house was there , light in two front windows , shades down . It was set well back from the road , behind a thin clump of trees . A car stood on the gravel drive in front . It was dark , indistinct , but it would be a brown coupe and it would belong @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the narrow wooden porch . He would let her take it out for a spin once in a while , and sit beside her , probably with a gun handy . The girl Rusty Regan ought to have married , that Eddie Mars could n't keep , the girl that had n't run away with Regan . Nice Mr. Canino . I trudged back to the garage and banged on the wooden door with the butt of my flash . There was a hung instant of silence , as heavy as thunder . The light inside wentP221out . I stood there grinning and licking the rain off my lip . I clicked the spot on the middle of the doors . I grinned at the circle of white . I was where I wanted to be . A voice spoke through the door , a surly voice : " What you want ? " " Open up . I 've got two flats back on the highway and only one spare . I need help . " " Sorry , mister . We 're closed up . Realito 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't like that . I kicked the door hard . I kept on kicking it . Another voice made itself heard , a purring voice , like a small dynamo behind a wall . I liked this voice . It said : " A wise guy , huh ? Open up , Art . " A bolt squealed and half of the door bent inward . My flash burned briefly on a gaunt face . Then something that glittered swept down and knocked the flash out of my hand . A gun had peaked at me . I dropped low where the flash burned on the wet ground and picked it up . The surly voice said : " Kill that spot , bo . Folks get hurt that way . " I snapped the flash off and straightened . Light went on inside the garage , outlined a tall man in coveralls . He backed away from the open door and kept a gun leveled at me . " Step inside and shut the door , stranger . We 'll see what we can do . "  | I stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I looked at the gaunt man , but not at the other man who was shadowy over by a workbench , silent . The breath of the garage was sweet and sinister with the smell of hot pyroxylin paint . " Ai n't you got no sense ? " the gaunt man chided me . " A bank job was pulled at Realito this noon . " " Pardon , " I said , remembering the people staring at the bank in the rain . " I did n't pull it . I 'm a stranger here . " " Well , there was , " he said morosely . " Some say it was a couple of punk kids and they got ' em cornered back here in the hills . " " It 's a nice night for hiding , " I said . " I suppose they threw tacks out . I got some of them . I thought you just needed the business . " " You did n't ever get socked in the kisser , did you ? " the gaunt man asked me briefly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice from over in the shadows said : " Cut out the heavy menace , Art . This guy 's in a jam . You run a garage , do n't you ? " " Thanks , " I said , and did n't look at him even then . " Okey , okey , " the man in the coveralls grumbled . He tucked his gun through a flap in his clothes and bit aknuckle , staring at me moodily over it . The smell of thepyroxylin paint was as sickening as ether . Over in thecorner , under a drop light , there was a big new-lookingP223sedan with a paint gun lying on its fender . I looked at the man by the workbench now . He was short and thick-bodied with strong shoulders . He had a cool face and cool dark eyes . He wore a belted brown suede raincoat that was heavily spotted with rain . His brown hat was tilted rakishly . He leaned his back against the workbench and looked me over without haste , without interest , as if he was looking at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people that way . He moved his dark eyes up and down slowly and then glanced at his fingernails one by one , holding them up against the light and studying them with care , as Hollywoodhas taught it should be done . He spoke around a cigarette . " Got two flats , huh ? That 's tough . They swept them tacks , I thought . " " I skidded a little on the curve . " " Stranger in town you said ? " " Traveling through . On the way to L.A. How far is it ? " " Forty miles . Seems longer this weather . Where from , stranger ? " " Santa Rosa . " " Come the long way , eh ? Tahoe and Lone Pine ? " " Not Tahoe . Reno and Carson City . " " Still the long way . " A fleeting smile curved his lips . " Any law against it ? " I asked him . " Huh ? No , sure not . Guess you think we 're nosey.  | Just on account of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ flats , Art . " " I 'm busy , " the gaunt man growled . " I 've got work to do . I got this spray job . And it 's raining , you might have noticed . " The man in brown said pleasantly : " Too damp for a good spray job , Art . Get moving . " I said : " They 're front and rear , on the right side . You could use the spare for one spot , if you 're busy . " " Take two jacks , Art , " the brown man said . " Now , listen  --  " Art began to bluster . The brown man moved his eyes , looked at Art with a soft quiet-eyed stare , lowered them again almost shyly . He did n't speak . Art rocked as if a gust of wind had hit him . He stamped over to the corner and put a rubber coat over his coveralls , a sou'wester on his head . He grabbed a socket wrench and a hand jack and wheeled a dolly jack @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaving the door yawning . Therain blustered in . The man in brown strolled over andshut it and strolled back to the workbench and put hiships exactly where they had been before . I could havetaken him then . We were alone . He did n't know who Iwas . He looked at me lightly and threw his cigarette onthe cement floor and stamped on it without looking down . " I bet you could use a drink , " he said . " Wet the insideand even up . " He reached a bottle from the workbenchbehind him and set it on the edge and set twop225glasses beside it . He poured a stiff jolt into each and held one out . Walking like a dummy I went over and took it . The memory of the rain was still cold on my face . The smell of hot paint drugged the close air of the garage . " That Art , " the brown man said . " He 's like all mechanics . Always got his face in a job he ought to have done last week . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ It had the right smell . I watched him drink some of his before I swallowed mine . I rolled it around on my tongue . There was no cyanide in it . I emptied the little glass and put it down beside him and moved away . " Partly , " I said . I walked over to the half-painted sedan with the big metal paint gun lying along its fender . The rain hit the flat roof hard . Art was out in it , cursing . The brown man looked at the big car . " Just a panel job , to start with , " he said casually , his purring voice still softer from the drink . " But the guy had dough and his driver needed a few bucks . You know the racket . " I said : " There 's only one that 's older . " My lips felt dry . I did n't want to talk . I lit a cigarette . I wanted my tires fixed . The minutes passed on tiptoe . The brown man and I were two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dead man named Harry Jones . Only the brown man did n't know that yet . Feet crunched outside and the door was pushed open.
