HAVE you ever heard of Irondale ? It is n't likely that you have . A year ago this great country estate of R. G. Billings  --  Billings , of Billings Iron &; Steel did not exist . The hill on which the huge main house stands was a barren knob . Not a tree grew there , not so much as a knee-high bush . And from this spot one gazed over a ragged and unkempt country of neglected woods , abandoned farm fields , straggling stone rows and sagging barns . The lake in the valley below , in summer , was half swamp ; in winter , gnarled limbs and black stumps defiled the ice . Here , but twelve months hack , was a land given over to crows and weasels , black snakes and croaking frogs  --  a bit of New York State gone to seed . Even the most adventurous of Sunday motorists avoided the road out of RawRon that led into what was known locally as the Mud Pond Country . The natives had a good laugh when they learned that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it and that he intended to build and live there . Today Billings is doing the laughing . The 1000 or so residents of Rawlton are still gasping . They are still pinching themselves to make sure that , like Rip Van Winkle . they have n't been asleep for twenty years , though in the case of irondale they might have been asleep for a half century or longer . The estate was finished only yesterday , as it were ; yet today it is all of a half century old , or at least that is the age it actually seems to be . And even an expert in such things would not quarrel with that estimate ; a layman would be willing to swear to it as a fact on the evidence of his eyes . Gone are the stone rows , the ragged fields , the tottering old frame barns . Gone is the ugly swamp and even a portion of the lake . In their place is a landscape that might have been old when Dewey took Manila and not young when Grant was President . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were in leaf when aristocratic New York rode in carriages and Detroit still had wooden sidewalks and mud streets . A veritable forest of old trees has sprung up , as if by some giant 's magic , on that once bleak and bare eminence , and amid this profusion of arboreal variety and color rise the bright green plumes of New England elms that range up to eighty feet in height . Those elms are from forty to seventy-five years old . As you stand before the massive wrought-iron entrance gates you may see the weather stains of decades on the stonework of the pillars and on the walls of the gateman 's lodge . Yet in spots the mortar is still damp . Apple trees heavy with fruit , oaks , lindens , maples , pines , like companies of picked soldiers at salute in open-rank formation , line the four miles of milky-white driveway that wind from the main gate to the rambling Old World mansion . Need I add that no man lives who can antiquate trees , yet last autumn not one of these trees was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with its 100 rooms , wear scars of years that Time alone could have etched , and which Time alone did etch . There is moss on the keystone of the portal . An ancient ivy , the trunk vine of which is as thick as a man 's leg , sends its dark green tendrils aloft to twine about the frames of the easement windows , but scratch the paint  --  ork of those frames and you 'll find that they are aluminum alloy . You . saunter over a flagstone terrace where grass grows , newly cropped , ih the crevices between the stones , and about the terrace is a border hedge of boxwood 200 years old . You glimpse a garden of boxwood that might have been planted in Colonial days , eta the boxwood actually was planted then . This is a hilltop that never owned a spring , but between a vista of trees and flowering shrubs a rivulet ripples , it seems from nowhere , down over sculptured-limestone cascades into an amber pool where lily pads float and swans preen their wings . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Servants pass to and fro softly . And tonight , if you but murmur the wish , this paradise will be flooded with the silver of artificial moonlight at the touch of an electric switch , and you will bathe in a marble pool whose tempered waters give oft the will-o ' - the- wisp glow of molten gold . And pity kings ! Below there in the valley , where the swampland was , and which a few months ago was inundated by the lake , you now can see lazy cattle grazing in luscious meadow grass . Over on that far slope , as smooth as a lawn , a lumbering Clydesdale mare with a foal at her flank gallops toward the white units of a stock farm . Beyond are the chicken ranch with its 3000 pure-bred fowls , the cattle barn , and the cottages of the experts in charge of Irondale 's varied agricultural activities . A garden of twenty acres is maintained ; 300 farm acres are cultivated . The big estate gives employment to 127 men and women .

Behind that willow grove is the polo field with its stables , and the stables of fifteen riding horses . The aviation field is about one mile farther along , on what once- was woodland , and of course there is a fireproof hangar , with planes in it ready to go . You are only an hour by air from New York City . Scattered here and there over the estate , which embraces all the land that one can see from the cetitriil hill , are the homes of the general manager , of his assistant , of the head gardener and his assistant , of the golf professional and the greens keeper , of other employes . There is the garage for forty cars , the laundry , the power house , the greenhouse , all screened by shrubbery and old trees . The tennis courts are inclosed for all-weather play , and in winter they can be turned into a skating rink . The estate 's private theater @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it boasts the latest talking-picture equipment . A gymnasium is available , Mid an athletic field . Bridle paths wander through the wooded hills , where there are cabins of hand-hewn logs for hunting and fishing parties . Holding the Mirror Up to Nature AND if , perchance , it should happen that you once had been familiar with this locality and its peculiar terrain , you surely will be seized by the belief that either you or the place itself is bewitched . A mile and a half to the northwest of the mansion , and included in the estate , is a clear body of water called Pequot Lake . By no manner of means was it possible in former days to see Pequot Lake from the bill on which the mansion stands . Another hill midway between the two blocked out the lake completely . To see it at all . it was necessary to ascend the second hill . Today Pequot Lake can be seen from any window of the Billings library . By day it gleams the blue green of turquoise . By moonlight it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rugged hills . This master touch in the landscape makes Irondale a triumph of natural artistry . Amazed , you follow the milky driveway back to that other hill . You recall that a quaint old farm cottage was once on its northern slope overlooking the lake . And standing again on this hilltop , you are aghast . The obstructing hill has been lowered and the hill of the mansion has been raised . You are not surprised that the cottage is gone . Even all signs of its foundation . have vanished . A lone pine , wind beaten in its exposed post , is all that is left to mark the site But below  --  a good half mile below and almost hidden by the thick foliage of the lake bank  --  you now see the top of a red brick chimney and a patch or vaguely familiar roof . You doubt your eyes , but suddenly you know that roof and chimney . They belong to the cottage that had stood halfway dawn the hillside . No illusion is this , but solid reality . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a lake once hidden has been made to be seen , and a house moved like papier-milehe ) stage scenery . Whole forests have been transplanted , old gardens built . A lake bottom has been made a pasture for grazing cows . And all or it has happened in a single year . Yet , as you survey the finished completeness of Irondale in the setting sun , a feeling comes upon you that it has always been so , that the years have tested its permanence , that ancient ghosts lurk in the raftered attic of the big house on the hill . Under the spell of its elms , its boxwood and ivy and age-scarred stones , you almost forget that its attic rafters are of modern steel , that their rivets were driven by pneumatic hammers , and that a summer ago this sleek countryside was as tattered and threadbare as a beggar 's coat . Strangely eimugh , however , there is nothing about Irondale that may be classed as extraordinary , paradoxical though that fact may seem . Nothing was done there that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ In fact , in most instances the seeming marvels of Irondale are being duplicated daily by those very matter-of-fact gentlemen  --  builders , architects , engineers and nurserymen ? who make a regular business of such things . Identical methods are even being followed , on a smaller scale , of course , in the erection and landscaping of quite modest American homes . Floe Reasons for Building T HE real triumph in the building of Irondale , and its true significance as a factor of public interest , tie in the fact that it might almost be called a glorified product of the commonplace in modern America . Strictly speaking , it is not a typical estate of its kind ; rather it is a composite one . Therefore , it also is an exemplification of existing trends . Every feature that it boasts was provided to solve a problem that was not peculiar alone to Mr. Billings . The project as a whole was inspired by the most human of desires . And the magic implements that made it possible were steam shovels and stone crushers , trucks and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of industry as money and men . The estate had its beginning in a fishing trip and in the election of Billings to the chairmanship of the board of the iron-and-steel company . The first introduced Billings to Pequot Lake , and the second gave him more leisure than he could use . The lake eblintry was spoiling for lack of development , and Billings , long an arduous worker , was spoiling for lack of action . Then , too , there were the Billings children  --  five of them ; two sons and three daughters . Billings east a line into Pequot and told himself with pointed emphasis that . a Park Avenue penthouse was nn place in which to rear youngsters of the age of fourteen , seventeen , nineteen , twenty and twenty-two years respectively . They would n't stay home , and he did n't blame them . He was lucky if he saw them ( Continued from Page 501 it ; he simply figured that Camp Dixon had been taken care of by other hospital units . He know that the shorter and quicker way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the north , and this , he decided , was what Stone had done . Knowing that T. P. had to get the coal home , Stone had wished two cripples off on him , not to mention a snowplowing job . The fat man decided ho was a sap ever to have left . Argyle . He 'd come this far on his own initiative , and it was up to him to keep on coming . Nobody had told him to leave Argyle ; if he pulled a fozzle and ruined one or more engines because of freezing , he 'd hold the bag . Jake Stone was in the clear ; he 'd swear that he 'd agreed to try to get a plow through . That dirty , lousy , crummy double-crosser , Jake Stone ! He was a smart one ! T. P. banged his net on the table . " More coffee , Mr. Patehbolt ? " asked the good-looking nurse . " Naw , " answered the fat man , glancing up . He recognized her as the girl Toby appeared to be dizzy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that women were so useless . So good-looking and so useless . A young muttonhead like Toby would do anything for this girl , he supposed , although he was at a loss to understand why . An idea suddenly occurred to Mr. Patehbolt . If Toby would climb back to the left side of the 621 and fire the engine  --  the same engine that had nearly washed him out of the picture not long since  --  he would unquestionably help the cause . Toby would go back , he felt sure , but he 'd go back grousing . If he 'd go back willingly , cheerfully ; if he 'd clamber up with his bandaged face and bruised body , and bawl , " Hell , men , let 's come to town ! " they 'd be hard to stop . He banged his fist on the table . " Hey ! " ? to the good-looking nurse . " More coffee ? " ? amiably . " I wanta talk to you . " Mr. Patch-bolt acted as though he were coy . " Nothing doing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've had enough foolishness from those two bums you brought in . " " Sit down ! " bawled the fat man , grossly insulted . The nurse sat down . T. P. grinned a very silly grin  --  a grin that could be taken several ways . " Now , listen , " said the nurse , start. - ing to rise . " Aw , this is serious . " The fat man detained her . " Listen , you want this outfit to go through , do n't you ? You would n't mind helping , would you ? " Within reason " ? very coldly . " Well , this is reasonable , " answered the fat man indignantly . " Here 's the idea , sister . You get that young buck with the burned lace all hopped up , see ? Get him to stay on the job even if he do n't feel good . See ? Talk him into it , tell him it 's a chance to play leader , tell him anything . Only get him back on the job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bright idea . See ? " " No , I do n't , " said the nurse . It took some little time for the maiden to grasp the meaning of Mr. Patchbolt 's strategy , but in the end she fell into step . v 91013Y turned the trick . He came waddling up to the engines wrapped in Pullman blankets and women 's scarfs ; his actions were those of a small boy with a toy train rather than of a grown man undertaking a somewhat risky , freezing job . " Whatcha want with cab windows ? " he demanded of Ed Blaine . " Listen , Ha wkeye , I 'm glad we ai n't got ' em . When I unload next time I do n't want no delay ! " It took four hours to clear Plateau of the drifts , to bring the train over the bump . But once over the hill , they were long gone . They met a few more comparatively heavy drifts , but after the mountainous obstacles they 'd previously overcome , these drifts were like cake and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they had come to town with three squat steel stacks bellowing of pagan conquest , with locomotives and cars heavy with ice and snow , with Merl of the road drooping with cold and desperate weariness . " Duck soup ! " said Ed Blaine , stumbling down the gang-way . Toby had been sent back to the Pullman , protesting weakly but bitterly , before they had cleared Plateau of the drifts ; Patehbolt had taken his place . Toby had passed out and slept the moment he hit a berth . The good-looking nurse woke him as they crawled near the terminal . " Oh , boy , how I ache ! " announced Mr. Lawson . " You 'd better stay in bed a few days , " said the nurse , very solicitous . " You most take care of yourself , Toby . " " Have n't got the time , Mabel . " Yes , her name was Mabel . " What 's a little time ? " said Mabel . " I got ta get me a uniform quick , " said Toby , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quick . I 'm liable to get killed hanssin ' around this railroad . " " What a guy ! " said Mabel admiringly . " Do n't forget my name and address , big-hearted ! " " Just hold your breath , " suggested big-hearted . When they pulled in and set the train out , Mr. Patehbolt proceeded , by the most direct route possible , to his hotel , where he collapsed on a bed , fully clothed . He was called at five the next morning , went down to the roundhouse and arranged for certain repairs to three engines . This done , he waddled into a restaurant and disposed of an enormous meal . He returned to the roundhouse  --  it was by then after eight  --  and was notified to report to the general manager . He reported . " You saved our skins , Patch bolt , " the chief informed him . " We were on the last of our coal . I do n't know yet how you got through at Plateau ; I told Jake Stone yesterday morning you could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said you could do anything ! So , instead of helping you on the coal and on that hospital unit , we brought in six hospital units from the north . I do n't see yet how you got through ! " " Give the credit to the train an ' engine crews , " answered T. P. grimly . " They did it . " He fished around in his pockets , produced a crumpled piece of paper . " Here 's the names . Ev'ry man of ' em oughtta get plenty of merit marks . An ' there 's a pumper at Argyle  --  name 's Haney  --  I doubt if we 'd have been able to leave Argyle if it had n't been for him . He knows his business an ' he ai n't afraid to work . " " I 'll remember him , " promised the chief . " Anybody else ? " " Ed Blaine oughtta get some kind of special treatment , " said T. P. judiciously . " You might keep Toby Lawson in mind , only he joined the Army @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a moment . Suddenly the older official flipped a heavy envelope at the fat man . " There 's your commission , " he rasped . T. P. opened the envelope , noted the contents . He was ordered to report immediately to Camp Dixon as a second lieutenant of the uth Engineers , the first railroad regiment to he formed for overseas service . " I 'm a soldier boy , " said the fat man . " Now , listen , " said the chief coldly . " Do n't you go around this outfit makin ' a big noise about . gain ' to war . If this railroad , and a lot more like it , do n't keep movin ' , you 're gon na find yourself in one swell jam on the other side . They ai n't gon na win this war on one side , they 're gon na win it on both sides . A lot of us poor suckers who 've got ta stay here " ? the chief was savage in his disappointment ? " will make or break you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a recruiting bee . Savvy ? " " Sure , " said Patehbolt . " I know how it is , boss . " " Yeah , you know how it is ? " - grimly . " Why , you fathead , you did more to whip the Dutchmen yesterday than you 'll do in all the time you 're in the Army . I do n't know who did the most . good yesterday  --  you or Stone . " Mr. Patehbolt stiffened perceptibly . " We took Stone 's word you 'd come through with the coal , and we used every ton we had  --  moved two regiments and sixty thousand tons of war material to Harbor . That man Stone is a dispatcher . And you 're no ham yourself at doing a job . " T. P. squirmed uncomfortably , stood up . " Well , so long , boss . " " Good luck . Say , Stone leaves today for Camp Dixon too . Same commission you got . " " Yeah ? " " You ought to see a good deal of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he 's got brains . You two could do Worse than tie together . Might be able to help each other . Eh ? " Rage mounted within the fat man , pounded at his temples . " Sure , " he said thickly , waddling for the door . " So long , boss . " In the hallway he met Stone face to face . T. P. 's eyes glittered , he thrust his chin forward . " You double-crosser ! " he snarled at Stone , and shoved him aside . " Why , you fat slob , " said the astonished Stone , staring after the broad back . He grinned maliciously . " When you want help the next time " ? Mr. Stone addressed the broad back once more ? " try and get it ! I 'll tell ' em you do n't need help ! " He took a few steps toward the office door , and added : " And the next time maybe you wo n't be so lucky ! " once a week . Under his breath , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ times in general and several country clubs in particular . He was filled with the urge to change . Before his return to New York , Billings had made up his mind , even had decided on the name of Irondale . There was nothing cream-puffy about that name . It had been on his mind a long time . Well , he 'd build a place that honored it . Whereupon Billings so far forgot himself as to whistle  --  something he had n't done in months . A few days later , an airplane , flying so low that it skimmed the wooded tops of the higher hills , was making bee-line flights over the territory around Pequot Lake . The plane began its seemingly aimless Cruising five miles to the north of the lake proper and swung back at a point five miles to the south of it . With each flight it kept working farther to the west toward Rawlton , while on the ground natives wondered . Peering through a trap in the aircraft 's belly , unseen from below , was the eye of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acorn plebs aerial-photographic survey of the Pequot Lake district and of all the country within a. radius of five miles . And not a landowner knew that he had it . Perhaps I should explain that though Billings had fished in Pequot Lake , he was not at all familiar with this section in detail . Until the aerial survey was placed in his bands , for example , he was even ignorant of the existence of the smaller body of water to the south called Mud Pond . At the same time , however , the country was not unacquainted with Billings . His name and likeness had appeared in magazines and newspapers often enough to make it a foregone conclusion that if he started any personal exploring he would be recognized by somebody . You can readily understand what would have happened to land prices if it had become known that a man of Billings ' wealth was looking about . But even if Billings had known the countryside far more intimately than he did , the aerial survey would have been of vital importance . It showed every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ building and village . The air cameraman supplied both vertical and oblique views of the terrain , both large-scale and small-scale maps . Surveyors afoot could not have compiled such an array of graphic . detail in months . Billings ' next move was just as farsighted . As yet , he did not own an acre of land , but he had a shrewd idea of what the land ought to be worth . lie had no intention of paying inflated prices or of buying blindly . He wanted not alone an intimate picture of the country 's physical characteristics but also an equally intimate knowledge of its life and values . So he hired detectives . Experienced real-estate investigators percolated into the district as fishermen , as farm hands , in one ease as an author seeking material for a histories novel with its setting in the locality , in another as an invalid seeking a farm that could be bought cheap . And presently reports from the investigators begun to assemble in the agency 's headquarters . Names were affixed to the tiny farmhouses on the aerial maps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take the Jones farm . It was No. 7 on the map . By turning to Card No. 7 in the agency 's report file , Mr. Billings learned that Benjamin Jones , the owner , was a Hicksite Quaker , sixty-seven years old , and a victim of rheumatism . A son-in-law , Jim Pelt , farmed the place , though he felt that he could earn more if he worked in town at his THE SATURDAY EVENING POST trade of carpentering . The property was assessed at $13700 WI I he Lax books , but Pelt declared it would bring all of $50,000 from a city buyer . Confidentially , however , Mrs. Jones had said they would take half that and feel rich , in as minds as they had paid only $9200 for 1 he farm in 1910 . Followed details about the acreage , the age and condition of I he house and outbuildings , the water supply , the ehara  --  ter of the timber and orchards , and various other facts that might interest as prospective buyer . livery farm in the urea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the several villages within access , and even went into their social life . For example , it was of considerable interest to Mr. Billings to read that the local Union Sunday School picnic was usually held at Pequot Lake , and that the Boy Scouts of the county were negotiating for the purchase of a camp thereabou ts . At this point Billings called in a noted architect . At the latter 's suggestion , a landscape architect of wide reputation was also engaged . Together the three blocked out the general boundaries of Irondale , the area to be purchased by Billings ' agents . The busy novelist suddenly decided to buy the cottage on the north hill overlooking the lake , as well as several other properties . The invalid took over three farms . The representative of what was vaguely described as a club bought Mud Pond . The fishermen acquired farms and mountain tracts . Pre  --  Excauation Work And then Billings himself stepped into the open and bought Pequot Lake , as well as a second lake four miles to the east . The extra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sunday School Association received a donation of 5.5000 from him . Then , and not until then , did Billings himself set foot on the land where the mansion stands now . He owned all the property in sight , yet most of it he saw for the first time . This leads up to what was , to me , one of the most astonishing phases of the building of Irondale . One unfamiliar with the practices followed in the building of great estates in a hurry might well suppose that , with the land acquired and elaborate air maps at hand , the matter of laying out the estate would be a work into which the owner and architects could enter at once . No assumption could be farther from the facts . Even Billings , trained to thoroughness , was amazed at the next steps . A drove of experts descended upon the place . They were armed with laboratory instruments and test tubes , hammers and drilling machines , notebooks and professorial titles . During the next four weeks they swarmed over woodlands and fields like Lilliputian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soil expert and his assistants made an exhaustive survey of the soil . Borings were made in the lowlands and in the highlands , and samples taken from the bottom of Mud Pond . Outcroppings of rock were scanned , sand deposits located , shale and gravel beds brought to light . Swamps were plumbed and subsoils analyzed . Simultaneously a second survey was under way , of the trees and plant life . The wild flowers were catalogued . Imposing lists of Latin names were compiled . Some trees were tagged for transplanting in more favored spots , some were marked for treatment by tree doctors , others were condemned to a speedy death . The prevailing winds were atudied , data gathered on temperatures , rains and snows , wet spells and dry spells . the peculiarities of drainage and erosion . All water on the property was both chemically and microscopically analyzed . The breeding spots of mosquitoes and other pests were ferreted out . The depths of Pequot Lake wore sounded , its sources traced . A topographer made an exact survey of the contours of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depths of the valleys , their inclines , circumferences and surface areas . A study was made of the volume and flow of all water sources and of possible causes of variation . Distances were charted between things and points , and complex snaps drawn . Detailed reports were compiled of the character and condition of all farm buildings and houses that had been acquired in the general purchase , inventories made of stock , implements , materials and crops . The loose property that could be used was segregated , the remainder assembled for sale at public auction . Moving vans of departing families rumbled over the roads . It must be kept in mind , too , that shortly a small army of workmen was to begin to move in as actual work on the building of the estate got . under way . Practically all the craftsmen , such as masons , carpenters , plasterers , roofers , plumbers , cabinetmakers , electricians , and a whole company of other specialists , would necessarily he brought in from New York City and require feeding and housing . Quarters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in existing buildings  --  kitchens expanded , utensils and bedding added . Before the completion of Irondale upward of 1000 men were to be engaged in the various phases of its creation , and this in a section of undeveloped country four miles from any sizable village . Therefore , careful plans had to be made with this in mind . Materials at Hand Finally , out of the vast array of facts assembled by the experts , the two architects began to formulate the general plan of the estate . Billings learned it would be possible to get all the stono he needed for his house foundations , the sand for his concrete and mortar , and crushed rock and gravel and shale for his roadways , right on the property . The bottom of Mud Pond was literally a mine of fertile topsoil that had been washed there by rains and freshets from the denuded fields about . One farmhouse contained a fine old mantelpiece that could be used in a Colonial type bedroom of the proposed mansion . A century-old barn contained some hand-hewn beams of hardwood that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study . Billings ' original , rather offhand idea of locating the big house on a point commanding Pequot Lake was discarded in the light of the exact information now available . The bare hill overlooking Mud Pond was selected . This hill enjoyed the most favorable winds in summer , was almost ideal in the natural opportunities it offered for landscaping , and it marked the center of the estate itself . Besides , it offered an opportunity for grand-scale scene shifting that stirred Billings ' blood to a faster tempo as he studied the topographer 's charts and checked them against the geologist 's report . The hill that obstructed the view to the northwest , as I have already do-scribed , was practically a solid mass of excellent building rock , That fact in itself was sufficient reason to do something with it . Moreover , the elevations noted on the charts showed that only a slight change in the heights of the two hills would open Pequot Lake to view in all its glory from the house site . In this connection the architects ' plan was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediate approval . They proposed to cut a slab of rock and earth to a depth of twenty-five feet off the crown of the obstructing hill and sot it down like a cap atop the mansion hill . Thus they would , in effect , give the house the equivalent of a fifty-foot increase in ita , elevation . " What about the mud lake and swamp ? " Billings asked . Plan for a Community Here again the plan was simplicity itself . The lake would be deepened by dredging until its overflow in the swamp would flow back to where it belonged . The swamp would then become a meadowland ; the west portion of it would afford a level field for polo . In turn , the tons of fertile soil taken from the lake bottom would be dumped on the newly filled hilltop to make a rich bed for the planting to be done there . When the job was complete , a lake would be in view from either side of the main house , and a person looking at the mansion from below would see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exquisitely landscaped terraces , " Draw up the plans , " grinned Billings . Once more it became necessary to consult experts . A champion golfer was engaged to lay out the golf links , a noted college athletic director to make suggestions as to the various sports units . The latter , I should explain , are of utmost importance in the big estate of today . If the estate is to lure its owner 's children from the country clubs , it must boast amusement facilities as fine as those of the clubs or even better . This is only a part of the problem ; if the estate miles out of town wishes to hold its servants and employes it must entertain them as well . The whole population of the place must be kept in mind in its planning . The estate theater is a good example of this . It is the newest wrinkle in estate building . The one at Irondale seats 300 persons . The stage is large enough to accommodate a musical play , and it has a full assortment of scenery and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of the leading New York theaters and is professionally operated . Pictures exhibited are first-run productions of the highest order . Shows are given twice weekly and , of course , admission is free to any employe of the estate and to his guests . Only on occasion is the theater reserved for the exclusive use of the Billingses . Throughout , in the planning of the estate , the fact had to be kept in mind that a number of scores of people were going to live there . Certain social lines had to be drawn , and yet a harmonious and efficient whole achieved . The various managers in the employ of such an estate are usually university graduates . They belong neither to the big house nor to the servants ' quarters . And between these two extremes are other sharply defined social grades , each jealous of its standing . Not alone a mansion but a veritable community of buildings bad to be designed . The plans had to be shifted and THE SATURDAY EVENING POST ( Continu  --  ti from Page 541 shifted again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , first as a problem in itself and then as a meta , digit in a general problem . Fluidly the whole had to be assembled and pictured graphically for Billings ' approval . A huge water-color painting of the central portion of the estate as it would be when complete was made by the landscape architect . The house arohitout 's staff made similar paintings of the innumerable buildings . These were supplemented by a massive relief map , made to scale and modeled in clay . When this elaborate piece of artistry was laid before him , Billings saw a perfect reproduction in miniature of the future Irondale . Even the trees and gardens were worked out with infinite exact detail in the model . This was later cast in plaster , and today you may see it under glass in the Irondale library . While his architects were thus occupied , Billings himself was enjoying some of the busiest weeks of his life . The estate was to be his home and he wanted a hand in its making . His first contribution was a master stroke of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spent several days on a business mission in a Western Pennsylvania town that had once been the center of a great coke-burning district . But the tide of industry had turned there . The coke ovens , built sturdily of native stone , for years had stood abandoned , and for half a century and longer the old stonework had stood exposed to the brush of time . Billings recalled the ovens vividly . They had been of peculiar interest to an old-timer of iron and steel . At the time a townsman had told him , laughingly , that a New York architect had recommended use of the stones in construction of the town 's finest church some years before , but the local building committee had vetoed the idea and had talked of dismissing the architect for his levity . The committee should have been fired , " had been Billings ' comment . Now he wondered about those old ovens . He decided he would have a talk with that church architect . Iron.dale Comes of ? Alga . The upshot was that Billings and his own architect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abandoned coke workings at a ridiculously low price . His architect estimated that by using the stones only as facings , they would have enough for all the principal buildings at Irondale . This explains the presence of moss on the keystone of the mansion 's portal , the mellow atmosphere of years that exudes from its walls . I have known builders who , in an effort to achieve some of this effect , have had workmen roll the newly cut stones over the ground to roughen and mar their surfaces . But this is synthetic age . The age of Iron-dale 's stones is genuine . Additional railroad sidings and unloading platforms had to he built at Rawlton village to handle the mass of materials and machinery that soon would be moving in . Billings arranged to get this work under way . The country road that led from the town to the estate was a dirt-and-gravel affair , not nearly up to the needs of the heavy truck traffic that would be using it daily . It was Billings who took the steps necessary to allow the reenforcing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of today marvel at the perfect symmetry of its trees , at their variety , size and manifest age . Well they nifty ; iL took Billings himself by surprise  --  the fact that such trees could be bought and transplanted . His landscape architect introduced him to a big-tree nursery , and the nursery 's experts in turn introduced him to the wonders of what amounts to n new science of its kind . Today it is possible to transplant trees at almost any season of the year and up to almost any size that can be moved over t he highways . Native elms , oaks , sugar maples , lindens , beeches , and an endless variety of other deciduous trees , as well as the whole family of evergreens , are being uprooted from soil in which they have stood for decades and replanted at distant sites . There are at Irondale several thriving elms that measure twenty-five inches in diameter of trunk and eighty feet in height . They are all of seventy-five years old . Last spring they were growing in a dooryard at Providence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a feat would have been ranked among the impossibilities . Tree Collecting From boyhood Billings had loved trees . Before Irondale was done he was a walking cyclopedia on their culture . He will tell you , as you gape upward at his elms , that the secret of transplanting a tree lies in keeping the air from the roots . This is true of evergreens even in winter . " Dig the tree so that a ball of earth protects the roots and secure the ball tightly in canvas , " he will explain . " Then get your tree into ground it favors and keep it watered until its roots take hold and it can shift for itself . " He learned that two general classes of trees are used in the landscaping of a modern estate . The first class is made up of trees that are nursery grown , the second of trees that are collected after long and arduous search , as one collects antiques . One class complements the other . The nursery grows trees that are not common to native woods , or that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ culture . If it is a big-tree nursery , the roots of its trees are pruned at stated intervals according to the species . The large anchor or holding roots are treated in a manner that directs the main-root growth into the feeder roots . This results in a mass of fibrous feeders that can quickly assimilate food upon removal to new soil . Guy wires hold the tree in place until its retarded anchor roots , which grow rapidly , are developed . Root pruning has made it possible to move mature trees that not long ago would not have been touched after they became too big to move in a wheelbarrow . One large nursery will sell you oaks up to fifty feet in height and ship them on two days ' notice . Collected trees , as Billings discovered by strenuous exertion , are found in woodlots , in farm fields , along roadsides and in rural dooryards , and occasionally on old estates in the process of being broken up . American elms , red cedars , the native white birch and sugar maples are the principal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widely and deeply . As a rule , it is possible to buy them where they stand , as occasion demands . Tractors , trucks and good roads make it possible to move them ; something that was n't done in the days of the wagon . Days on end Billings and his expert companions scouted through the hills and dales of New England on a hunt for this second class of trees . The farmers with whom they did business thought they wore daft , not dreaming that trees of the size selected could be moved , let alone that they would live after removal . One of his finest sugar maples was almost a gift . The owner challenged the experts to move it without cutting it down . The weight of the tree was twenty-one tons . You may see it today among a clump of similar maples that screen the Irondale garage . The search entailed more than the mere location of purchasable trees . Every tree had to be a perfect specimen of its kind . It had to be free of disease , and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pig is . The tree also had to be in a reasonably accessible spot from the road . Consider that the whole East has been scoured by millionaires collecting trees , and that some of the finest trees are not to be had at any price , and you will begin to appreciate the size of the task Billings had tackled . For his main driveway alone he needed 400 apple trees , preferably about fifteen years old . He had to go all the way to Maine to get them . Too , the nursery trees had to be selected . The big-tree nursery recommended by the architect sprawled over 1000 acres . It was a vast department store of trees . Literally millions of trees of every conceivable variety suitable to Northern climate were for sale . Billings might have stepped up to the counter and ordered trees by the 100 lots , or this detail might have been left to his architect . But trees have an individuality . To Billings , buying trees was like hiring men or choosing his neighbors . He expected to live with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Boxwood Thousands of flowering and nonflowering shrubs had to be bought , the members of the family consulted as to their favorite flowers , and there was the boxwood . Billings ' oldest daughter wanted a boxwood garden , an old garden such as she had seen in the South . Billings went to North Carolina , ostensibly to play golf , but a nurseryman went with him . Together they bumped over back roads in a rickety flivver , seeking trails that some other collector of scenery had not covered . In two weeks they gathered thirty-two carloads of boxwood , and most of it antedated the Declaration of Independence . One marvelous clump of the dwarf variety at least two centuries old was bought for twenty-five dollars . The farmer who owned it had offered to give it away , said he 'd been plowing around the blamed stuff for forty years . And in the meantime , back at Iron-dale , the new rail sidings and the new road were nearing completion . Contracts and subcontracts were being let by the architects  --  a total of forty-seven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ next year . Steam shovels and stone crushers , tractors and trucks , concrete mixers and gasoline engines were being trundled and hauled into position . The captains and the men appeared . The crows took flight , the snakes and weasels sought new hunting grounds . On is September morning Billings stood on his chosen hill and watched an industrial army go into action . Dynamiters took possession of the offending hill that was to lose its head . A faint cloud of dust arose , a dull blast sounded , and Billings saw the first rock crumble  --  rock on which Iron-dale 's mansion was to stand . A narrow-gauge railway linked the two hills . It was n't long until a string of loaded cars was scooting toward Billings . He cheered like a boy . In Rawltou , a group of gaping natives watched the unloading of still another monster . It was the giant dredge that presently was to suck up the bottom of the mud lake , turn the ugly swamp into a smiling meadow and make it possible for roses to bloom and trees @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Long Island a dealer in sifted white gravel that had been washed throughout the ages by the sea entered an order on his books for carloads of gravel to surface Irondale 's driveways . Still another Long Island dealer , in real estate , noted the fact that the perfect old golf greens of a disbanding country club were in due time to be taken up and transported with minute care to some forsaken wilderness upstate . In a far Pennsylvania town expert workmen rather wonderingly began to dismantle , bit by bit , the weathered stones of soma abandoned coke ovens , being careful not to disturb the moss . Trees That Pass in the Night The big-tree nursery was the scene of record activity . Not for weeks would the larger trees begin to move , but work was to be done nevertheless . Again the scouts went out . Those innumerable trees scattered wide over the New England countryside had to be routed by sure ways to Irondale . A ten-ton bridge is no place for a twenty-ton load . An elm with sixty feet of spread , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass under a fourteen-foot headway . A seventy-foot tree wo n't turn at narrow street corners in cities and towns . Police traffic departments of cities through which it was necessary to move the trees had to be consulted , permits secured , dates set , schedules arranged . The usual requirement in cities is for the tree removal to begin at midnight . At about two o'clock , with red lanterns blinking fore and aft , the ponderous hulks are permitted to enter the business district . They are prostrate and bound on rubber-tired tree movers , before which rumble the snorting motor-trucks . By four o'clock they must be clear of the main traffic center , by daylight at the edge of town . Billings was to watch one of these processions . It was like taking captive giants through a place awed and deserted . The two architects reported to Billings like aides to their general . The landscape staff had most of the athletic features in charge . At the same time they had to make ready for the oncoming forests . A system that would supply @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community 's needs , as well as provide automatically controlled sprinkler devices for the acres of lawns , the golf greens , the polo field and the several gardens , had to be built in advance of the planting . Means of furnishing moisture for some trees by underground pipings had to be devised . Elms , for example , prefer a moist but well-drained soil , and if this condition does not naturally exist , it must be artificially created . So Irondale took form out of seeming chaos . The plans had been too well drawn , the orders too well written , the leaders too well chosen to permit of a slip . There in the ragged hills the picked craftsmen of an industrial age ( Conttnued from Page sa ) forgot prosaic shops and smoking factories to build with machines a piece of art . There is but one phase of the story untold . Billings himself confessed to me its details . As a youngster , working in the iron foundries of Pittsburgh , he had seen engineers perform what was an almost incredible feat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ railroad extension , had been moved intact from the bottom to the top of a **27;217;TOOLONG cliff . Not even the plaster of its interior had been cracked . By an ingenious succession of jacking and cribbing. the structure had been lifted by fractions of an inch at a time , with its furniture in place , wi Lb pictures on its walls , with china dishes in its closets . Memory of that feat was what prompted Billings to move the hill cottage , which I 've mentioned , from its original site on the slope to the lake bank , a distance of half a mile . He wanted that cottage in a secluded spot . It was not an especially difficult job of house moving . It was spectacular . A block trestle was built , the house rolled onto it , and then new trestlework was constructed of the movable blocks as the cottage proceeded on its way , step by step . As the hill dropped off , hydraulic jacks eased the house to a lower level . At one spot it had to pass over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The furnishings were moved with the house , even the old-fashioned cook-stove in the kitchen , the blue-andwhite dishes in the dining-room cupboard and the rag-carpet rugs in the parlor . To this homely setting Billings added an atrocious but comfortable armchair , an array of old hooks , a pipe rack and several very battered felt hats . There is no telephone in this house . No road or pathway leads to it . No servants have a place under its roof . But when the magnificence of Mansion Hill begins to pall , when Billings and Mrs. Billings desire freedom , or whatever it is that multimillionaires sometimes seek but do n't find in wealth , then you may find them in the cottage  --  the two alone . Most great modern estates have somewhere , hidden away in a tiny world by itself , a cottage .
