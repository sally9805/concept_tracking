txt Displacement of workers by laborsaving machinery is a commonplace of present-day discussion . One such instance is to be found in the figures on workers in domestic and personal service , constituting part of the Census Bureau 's report on occupations . In view of the huge transfer of labor from the home to the factory , the replacement of the kitchen by the outside bakery and laundry , the enormous development of electrical housekeeping machinery , and the actual abandonment of the home in favor of the hotel and the restaurant , it was supposed that the census would record a large decrease in the number of people working for wages in home occupations . A notable decline was found between 1910 and 1920 . In the former year , of all persons working for pay , 9.9 per cent were in domestic and personal service . In 1920 the rate was 8.2 per cent . This decline was what one would expect from the progress of the steam laundry , the mammoth bakery , the cleaning and dyeing establishment , the enormous growth of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next ten years should have brought the domestic and personal worhers down to about 6 per cent of all persons gainfully employed . Instead , there was an increase . In 1930 the rate had gone up to 10.1 per cent of all workers . More people were so employed than in 1910 , not only actually because of the larger population but proportionately . We have got into the habit of thinking of ourselves in almost a servautless age , yet actually there are more servants than ever . The figures are , of course , emphatic in the case of women , who constitute most of the workers in this category . In 1910 of all women gainfully employed 31.3 per cent were in domestic and personal service . In 1920 the rate was down to 25.6 per cent , which was in consonance with the observed facts about the drift of women from the home occupations to the office , factory and professions . But in 1930 the rate was up again to 29.6 per cent . In 1930 there were enumerated 243,600 cooks in hotels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presumably in the homes  --  against 398,000 cooks of all kinds in homes and hotels and restaurants in 1920 . So with " servants " ; there were enumerated in 1930 in hotels , restaurants and boarding houses 193,600 and " others " ? in homes  --  to the number of 1,210,000 ; this against a total of 872,000 servants of all kinds , in and out of the home , in 1920 . A probable explanation is to be found in the great prosperity of the years before 1930 . Presumably many housewives who used to do their own work were then in a position to hire " help , " and families that had employed servants increased their domestic staffs . But whatever may be the truth about the home , there is no getting away from the fact that in the nation at large the application of mass-production methods to former home occupations  --  the use of steam and electricity for baking bread and washing clothes and beating carpets ? did not throw people out of work , but created more work . In the face of all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ domestic and personal ' trades went up from 3,1000 in the year 1920 to 4,952,000 ten years later . IMM ? ? ? ? ?
