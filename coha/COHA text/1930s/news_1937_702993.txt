txt chase of property needed for the exAn important step toward the purpansionof tits ....... Chicago air port was taken last night when an agreement on an arbiter to 4et the price of the needed land was reached . Acquisition of the land would mean an early start on $3,000,000 of WPA work and a track re-location program that would cost $500,000 . Arthur Kruggel , Arthur Brugge ! . who will become president of the Chicago Real Estate board tomorrow , was chosen as the third appraiser to act with John R. O'Connor , representing the city , and Ernest H. Lyons , representing Raymond E. Herman , owner of the property . Pleased Over Acceptance . Mayor Kelly , Lyons , and Herman were delighted , ; : hey said . when Kruggel agreed to serve on the appraisal committee . " I am happy to serve if both skies approve , " said Kruggel . " This is a civic problem and much good will be done the whole city if it is solved . " Until the agreement was reached it appeared that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mayor Kelly was planning an alternative program that would not have required the cooperation of Herman . Lyons and O'Connor had failed , in conferences to come close to agreement on price , the former holding $63,000 was fair and the city 's appraiser refusing to raise the figure above $20,000 . Lyons said last night Kruggel may reach a decision within two or three days , and the new president of the realty board announced that he was willing to devote Tuesday a n d Wednesday to the task of getting the matter settled . Tract of 21/4 , Acres Needed . Herman 's property consists of 105 acres bounded by 55th street , Archer , Cicero , and Laramie avenues . All that is needed for the airport project is a strip of this land 46 feet wide , running east and west and paralleling the tracks of the Indiana Harbor Belt line , which bisects the property  --  a total of 21 , ! t acres  --  and the reversionary rights of Herman in the right of way of the railroad . Tracks of the Chicago and Western @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ street from Cicero avenue to Laramie avenue , would be relocated on the required land . The present north boundary of the air field is 59th street , but under the plan , once the C. &; W. I. tracks are moved , it will he extended north to 55th street . It will then be a mile square and affor ( ample room to accommodate modern air tratic . Mayor Kelly 's alternative plan , which may he abandoned now that an arbiter has been named , was to locate the &r.; W. I. tracks just south of 55th street , thus cutting 100 feet from the north-south side of the I airport ; or to place them just north of 55th street and condemn a right of way through the Herman property for this .
