txt Continuing its fall amid active speculative trading here , the dollar dropped today to 4.84% to the pound  --  within 2 cents of the old parity of the pound . Later , The London Times reports , there was a commercial demand for dollars , and New York also sent in buying orders for them , so the rate fell back , closing at 4.79% . The dollar ranged 14 cents on the pound . The Canadian dollar passed 5 to the pound , ranging from 4.79 to 5.05 . Gold currencies continued buoyant , with , as The London Times says , " indications of the effect of the agreement between the gold standard countries . " Gold Currencies Supported . " Any of the gold currencies which developed weakness appeared promptly to be supported , the Swiss franc being a particular case in point , " that newspaper says . " The Dutch exchangc , which lately has been most skillfully managed by the Bank of the Netherlands , remained at about the gold import point . " London , by selling , brought the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soon as the selling stopped the rate receded , to close at 84% . The gold premium in the bullion ' market rose to 11d . The speculative wave declined similarly in stock markets , which , after a firm opening , weakened , with a rather violent fall in a number of industrial shares , which The London Times ascribes to the size of the position to be carried over , with Wall Street 's opening doing nothing to improve matters . The dollar fell below the old parity of the pound as far as Amer- ican tourists and others dealing in small amounts were concerned . One case was reported of an American having to pay $5 for a pound . The big hotels gave rates of 4.95 . At least one of them followed the example set when 141 American banks closed and preferred to advance pounds to American guests rather than exchange money in so unsettled a market . New Attitude Seen . Neville Chamberlain , Chancellor of the Exchequer , told the House of Commons today that the dollar 's depreciation was to a very large @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ might be reversed in Autumn . This statement , together with the more hopeful and more conciliatory spirit among gold country delegates at the economic conference , seems to indicate that the political pressure which helped to induce speculation against the dollar is being reversed . If all this means that the Europeans who are so fearful of the dollar 's depreciating are finally realizing that their very fear and their scare tactics are contributing heavily to the present rapid depreciation , then the more realistic view on this side of the ocean is likely to have a very strengthening effect on the dollar  --  especially if their realism proves as contagious among Americans as their apprehensions have been . Stabilization Report Doubted . Reports from London that the dollar might be stabilized in relation to the pound sterling at 4.86 did not . impress the New York financial community as especially substantial yesterday . At the same time , however , bankers admitted that they were pretty generally in the dark as to the plans of the administration on the currency . It was pointed out , however , thatl @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the formula laid down by President Roosevelt in his message to the London Economic Conference several days ago , when he indicated that he was not interested in the movement of the dollar in foreign exchange markets , and stated that his objective was the creation of a currency which would have a permanent value over a period of years . " That objective , " he said , " means more to the good of the nations than a fixed ratio for a month or two in terms of the pound or the franc . " One prominent banker said last night that he could see nothing sacred , under present conditions , in the figure 4.86 . He pointed out , however , that the psychological effect upon foreign traders and speculators of seeing the pound come so close to its old parity might be disconcerting . Yesterday 's trading in foreign exchange was actually very quiet , and at no time did experts think they saw any traces of official operations , either on the part of the Federal Reserve Bank or the Bank of England . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that trading fell off perceptibly , as commercial buyers appeared reluctant to pay that price in connection with their commercial transactions . Equalization Fund Factor . In some quarters , however , it was suggested that the slowness of the market might be attributed partly . to a fear of what Britain might do through its equalization fund . It was thought possible that Britain , and not this country , would be the one to initiate action in defense of its price structure if the dollar continued to slip much further . Such a move might , it was pointed out , imply " unhooking " the pound from the franc and hooking it to the dollar , or even pushing the pound down so that the dollar would appear to be rallying . Throughout the period of sharp declines in the dollar the pound and tile French franc have moved closely together . It was further pointed out that any hooking up of the pound and the dollar would appear to be of little benefit to the British . At the $4.86 level Britain would have lost all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to its foreign trade with or in competition with this country and many other non-gold countries . Furthermore , exchange specialists said , Britain 's equalization fund would have to trade in dollars of an unknown value in any move to hook up with this country 's currency . This would mean that the entire fund might become invested in dollars which could not be con verted into gold , and . which could not be sold without completely destroying all vestiges of stabilization and leaving the fund in a very reduced position .
