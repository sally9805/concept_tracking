Not one leaf of flue-cured tobacco has sold this week in all North or South Carolina . Nor last week . Nor the week before . Tens of thousands of Carolina farmers could get no ready money . It was like the Midwest in drought time . Banks could not collect fertilizer loans or mortgage payments . Storekeepers were passing out pints of kerosene on credit . <P> Tobacco 's bad year followed a good year . Last December , when tobacco growers were called to a crop-control referendum , they had just finished disposing of a big ( 800-million-pound ) crop at the satisfying average price of 22 per pound . They sneered at the compulsory quotas Henry Wallace wanted them to vote and proceeded to plant a far greater acreage this year than quota allotments would have permitted . Fine weather favored the growing , and up sprouted 1,014,000,000 pounds of fat tobacco , 200 million pounds more than a maximum year 's consumption . <P> When the crop came to market late this summer , prices staggered " under the surplus . By September 8 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were knocking down the tobacco at 14 . Then Britain 's big Imperial Tobacco Co. , which normally buys a third of the flue-cured crop , stepped out of the market . For one more week the farmers hung on and watched their crops going at ever lower prices . When prices broke through 11 ( half of last year 's price ) , they desperately closed the markets . <P> Immediately , indefatigable Henry Wallace called a conference . All through the South , the sheepish growers wondered what their ransom was going to be . North Carolina 's big , handsome Commissioner of Agriculture William Kerr Scott suggested sadistically that the markets be reopened , the farmers left to squirm . Henry Wallace announced in an AAA pamphlet : " . . . It would not be sound to undertake price-supporting measures for the 1939 crop unless farmers indicate a desire to regulate marketings for the 1940 crop . " Warehousemen held meetings , shouted for crop control , promised to use their influence on the farmers . <P> This week the announcement came that Commodity Credit Corp . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be given them to proceed with normal purchases . The tobacco would be held in the U. S. and the British would have an option to buy any time before July 1941 . The markets then would be reopened on Tuesday , Oct. 10 . <P> But , said crafty Henry Wallace , none of this would be done unless farmers vote for a compulsory quota ( 660,000,000 pounds ) in the October 5 referendum .
