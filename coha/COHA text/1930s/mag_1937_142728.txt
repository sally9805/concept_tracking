Seven men ( included wounded who died ) last week went to their graves as the result of the battle between pickets and police before Republic Steel Corp . ' s South Chicago plant ( TIME , June 7 ) . In Chicago a " mass funeral " was staged for three of them by the Steel Workers Organizing Committee . Meanwhile the violence of the S. W. O. C. strike against three big independent steel com- panies-Republic , Youngstown and Inland - subsided . In Detroit , where fortnight ago United Automobile Workers organizers were beaten at the entrance to Ford 's River Rouge plant , the fighting shifted to court . On both fronts the combatants took advantage of the lull to maneuver for position . On both sides the sense of injury grew deeper and darker . <P> Steel Front . Inside the Republic plant near which the bloodshed had taken place , newshawks found that some 1,000 non-strikers were not having a bad time , playing baseball and ping-pong in off hours . But Chicago 's Mayor Edward J. Kelly acted to end their cloistered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the men were living in quarters ( a wire mill ) not designed for residence , an infraction of the city 's health and housing ordinances . They would have to be evacuated within 48 hours . When the time expired , the company shunted 21 Pullman cars inside its gates , installed about 600 workers in them , said the rest would go home at night . <P> In Ohio 's Mahoning Valley , site of several Republic and Youngstown plants , other maneuvers were afoot . Basic strategy of all three steel companies was to sit tight , wait for back-to-work movements to start among such of their workers as were not actively allied with the S. W. 0 . C. strike . They counted on aroused public feeling to assure protection for men going back to work . The Youngstown plants were entirely shut down , in charge of company maintenance men . Republic plants were in partial operation . All were in a state of close siege by strikers . Around the Republic plant at Warren , Ohio , the roads for miles were taken over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it " Strike Law . " Airplanes , making regular flights to deliver food to the plants at Warren and Niles , were sniped at and repeatedly hit by rifle bullets . The company offered $1,000 reward ( unclaimed ) for information leading to the arrest and conviction of snipers . <P> To prevent supplies entering the plants by rail , strikers put ties on the tracks , threatened the train crews until they retired " in fear of bodily injury . " This brought the railroads into the picture : Pennsylvania , B &; O and Erie . They appealed to the courts for an injunction to prevent strikers from blocking their tracks . S.W.O.C. counsel replied that the railroads were not acting on their own behalf but merely as a catspaw for the steel companies .
