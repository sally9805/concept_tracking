In the massive Cathedral of the Reformed Church in Utrecht , The Netherlands last week , Dr. John Raleigh Mott , large and serene , mounted the pulpit . To the churchmen of all nations gathered before him he spoke in English . He urged the world 's churches to compose their differences , drew a gloomy picture of the world 's troubles ; but he said : " We come not as pessimists . " Dr. Mott and 78 other churchmen , representing 130 denominations with 350,000,000 members in 21 nations , had gone to Utrecht to lay plans for a world council of churches . Such an ecumenical council would continue the labors of the world conferences on Life &; Work and Faith &; Order which heartened the non-Roman religious world with their meetings in Oxford and Edinburgh last summer ( TIME , July 26 ) . <P> Under the chairmanship of the Arch bishop of York , who loomed as the council 's most likely first president , the delegates speedily adopted a constitution . This they proposed to submit , along with an invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lord Jesus Christ as God and Savior . " The constitution provided for an assembly of 450 members , an active central committee of 90 , in which U. S. and Canadian churches would have 18 members . To obtain the approval of the great Protestant , Orthodox and other Catholic churches , and to organize the council , will probably take two years .
