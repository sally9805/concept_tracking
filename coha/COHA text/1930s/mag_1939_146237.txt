A pair of 1,200-h.p . Wright Cyclonesrowling in a hangar ; a glimpse of green fields through a hole in the overcast ; 200m.p.h. ; an odd pressure in your ears ; a old jet of air in your face ; a pretty hostess handing you hot chicken ; a sleek transport drifting in to a landing , flaps extended like an old lady spreading her skirts as she sits down ; a lean beacon fingering the dark . An airline is all these things , and it is a dollar- &-cents; business . Last week the U. S. airline which once was shakier than most in dollars &; cents took its place in the major league of Big Business-the stock of American Airlines , previously on the Curb , was listed on the New York Stock Exchange . <P> American Airlines was born just ten years ago , when Wall Street suddenly decided that aviation was to be the next great industry . A dozen or so big underwriters formed Aviation Corp. , sold $35,000,000 worth of stock and with the proceeds bought up some 80 aeronautical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presently lumped into American Airways . As might have been expected , the conglomeration had an operating loss of $3,400,000 in 1930 . Successive losses brought continued shake-ups in management until 1932 , when Plunger Errett Lobban Cord got control after a spectacular proxy battle . <P> Cord management succeeded in cutting the deficit down to $600,000 in 1933 but next year the notorious airmail cancellations dealt American Airways a $4,500,000 wallop and it had to reorganize , emerging in its present form as American Airlines , Inc . The same year American got its present president , homespun , slangy Cyrus Rowlett ( " C. R. " ) Smith of Texas . <P> " C. R. , " who began as an accountant , found himself boss of an incredibly disjointed network sweeping across the U. S. from Boston to Los Angeles , flown by an assortment of Condors , Vultees , Stinsons , and generally regarded in aviation as the weakest of the big lines . Last year , by contrast , American was the only transcontinental line to show a profit-$213,000-while its two competitors , United and TWA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the biggest and fastest-growing airline in the U. S. In the first four months of 1939 its passenger revenue was 26% over a year ago . <P> C. R. Smith arranged the five-year transition with the help of two vice presidents , Ralph Damon and Charles A. Rheinstrom . Brought from the presidency of Curtiss Aeroplane &; Motor Co. , energetic Ralph Damon modernized and standardized American 's fleet , which now consists of 50 Douglas " flagships , " and has the magnificent operating record of no passenger fatalities since January 1936 . High-powered Charles Rheinstrom pepped up American 's sales technique , invented airline " scrip , " since adopted by the major domestic lines . In advertising , C.R. Smith and his two first lieutenants were equally progressive . One of their headlines : " Fewer Husbandless Nights . "
