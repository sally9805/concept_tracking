txt Will Rogers Sees One Reason For Hope in the Arms Parley To the Editor of The New York Times : ABOARD THE S. S. EUROPA , Feb. ** I got the disarmament conference off to a good start . Ca n't say it was n't running smooth when I left . No meeting today on account of the war in China . They have to disarm between shots . Now I am going to make you a prediction . I believe that conference will get somewhere . You know why ? Just because nobody thinks that it will . I believe they will just accidentally do something . I have been to all of ' em and they all started out expecting big things , and then busted . At this one every delegate enters with an apology , so I kinder got some hopes . I give " Doe " Woolley her parting instructions and I am coming home to Cuckooland . God bless It . He has n't lately , however , but He will when we deserve it . Yours , WILL ROGERS . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
