Daphne du Maurier " And what did you know then ? " he asked . " Why , that you lived at Manderley and  --  and that you had lost your wife . " There , I had said it at last , the word that had hovered on my tongue for days . Your wife . It came out with ease , without reluctance , as though the mere mention of her must be the most casual thing in all the world . Your wife . The word lingered in the air once I had uttered it , dancing before me , and because he received it silently , making no comment , the word magnified itself into somethingheinous and appalling , a forbidden word , unnatural to the tongue . And I could not call it back , it could never be unsaid . Once again I saw the inscription on the fly-leaf of that book of poems , and the curious slanting R. I felt sick at heart and cold . He would never forgive me , and this would be the end of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the wind-screen , seeing nothing of the flying road , my ears still tingling with that spoken word . The silence became minutes , and the minutes became miles , and everything is over now , I thought , I shall never drive with him again . To-morrow he will go away . And Mrs. Van Hopper will be up again . She and I will walk along the terrace as we did before . The porter will bring down his trunks , I shall catch a glimpse of them in the luggage lift , with new-plastered labels . The bustle and finality of departure . The sound of the car changing gear as it turned the corner , and then even that sound merging into the commontraffic , and being lost , and so absorbed forever . I was so deep in my picture , I even saw the porter pocketing his tip and going back through the swing-door of the hotel , saying something over his shoulder to the commissionaire , that I did not notice the slowing-down of the car , and it was only when we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that I brought myself back to the present once again . He sat motionless , looking without his hat and with his white scarf round his neck , more than ever like someonemedieval who lived within a frame . He did not belong to the bright landscape , he should be standing on the steps of a gaunt cathedral , his cloak flung back , while a beggar at his feet scrambled for gold coins . The friend had gone , with his kindliness and his easy camaraderie , and the brother too , who had mocked me for nibbling at my nails . This man was a stranger . I wondered why I was sitting beside him in the car . Then he turned to me and spoke . " A little while ago you talked about an invention , " he said , " some scheme for capturing a memory . REBECCA 41You would like , you told me , at a chosen moment to live the past again . I 'm afraid I think rather differently from you . All memories are bitter , and I prefer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ altered my whole life , and I want to forget every phase in my existence up to that time . Those days are finished . They are blotted out . I must begin living all over again . The first day we met , your Mrs. Van Hopper asked me why I came to Monte Carlo . It put a stopper on those memories you would like to resurrect . It does not always work , of course , sometimes the scent is too strong for the bottle , and too strong for me . And then the devil in one , like a furtive peeping Tom , tries to draw the cork . I did that in the first drive we took together . When we climbed the hills and looked down over the precipice . I was there some years ago , with my wife . You asked me if it was still the same , if it had changed at all . It was just the same , but  --  I was thankful to realise  --  oddly impersonal . There was no suggestion of the other time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have been because you were with me . You have blotted out the past for me , you know , far more effectively than all the bright lights of Monte Carlo . But for you I should have left long ago , gone on to Italy , and Greece , and further still perhaps . You have spared me all those wanderings . Damn your puritanical little tight-lipped speech to me . Damn your idea of my kindness and my charity . I ask you to come with me because I want you and your company , and if you do n't believe me you can leave the car now and find your own way home . Go on , open the door , and get out . " I sat still , my hands in my lap , not knowing whether he meant it or not . ' Well , " he said , " what are you going to do about it ? " Had I been a year or two younger I think I should have cried . Children 's tears are very near the surface , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt them prick behind my eyes , felt the ready colour flood my face , and catching a sudden glimpse of myself in the glass above the wind-screen saw in full the sorry spectacle that I made , with troubled eyes and scarlet cheeks , lank hair flopping under broad felt hat . " I want to go home , " I said , my voice perilously near to trembling , and without a word he started up the engine , let in the clutch and turned the car round the way that we had come . Swiftly we covered the ground , far too swiftly , I thought , far too easily , and the callous countryside watched us with indifference . We came to the bend in the road that I had wished to imprison as a42 Daphne du Mauriermemory , and the peasant girl was gone , and the colour was flat , and it was no more after all than any bend in any road passed by a hundred motorists . The glamour of it had gone with my happy mood , and at the thought of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pride was lost , and those despicable tears rejoicing at their conquest welled into my eyes and strayed upon my cheeks . I could not check them , for they came unbidden , and had I reached in my pocket for a handkerchief he would have seen . I must let them fall untouched , and suffer the bitter salt upon my lips , plumbing the depths of humiliation . Whether he had turned his head to look at me I do not know , for I watched the road ahead with blurred and steady stare , but suddenly he put out his hand and took hold of mine , and kissed it , still saying nothing , and then he threw his handkerchief on my lap , which I was too ashamed to touch . I thought of all those heroines of fiction who looked pretty when they cried , and what a contrast I must make with blotched and swollen face , and red rims to my eyes . It was a dismal finish to my morning , and the day that stretched ahead of me was long . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , because the nurse was going out , and afterwards she would make me play bezique with all the tireless energy of the convalescent . I knew I should stifle in that room . There was something sordid about the tumbled sheets , the sprawling blankets and the thumped pillows , and that bed-side table dusty with powder , spilt scent , and melting liquid rouge . Her bed would be littered with the separated sheets of the daily papers folded anyhow , while French novels with curling edges and the covers torn kept company with American magazines . The mashed stubs of cigarettes lay everywhere , in cleansing cream , in a dish of grapes , and on the floor beneath the bed . Visitors were lavish with their flowers , and the vases stood cheek-by-jowl in any fashion , hothouseexotics crammed beside mimosa , while a great be-ribboned casket crowned them all , with tier upon tier of crystallised fruit . Later her friends would come in for a drink , which I must mix for them , hating my task , shy and ill-at-ease in my corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a whipping boy again , blushingfor her when , excited by her little crowd , she must sit up in bed and talk too loudly , laugh too long , reach to the portable gramophoneand start a record , shrugging her large shoulders to the tune . I preferred her irritable and snappy , her hair done up in pins , scoldingme for forgetting her Taxol . All this awaited me in the suite , REBECCA 43while he , once he had left me at the hotel , would go away somewherealone , towards the sea perhaps , feel the wind on his cheek , follow the sun ; and it might happen that he would lose himself in those memories that I knew nothing of , that I could not share , he would wander down the years that were gone . The gulf that lay between us was wider now than it had ever been , and he stood away from me , with his back turned , on the further shore . I felt young and small and very much alone , and now , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my nose , ' throwing my drab appearance to the winds . It could never matter . " To hell with this , " he said suddenly , as though angry , as though bored , and he pulled me beside him , and put his arm round my shoulder , still looking straight ahead of him , his right hand on the wheel . He drove , I remember , even faster than before . " I suppose you are young enough to be my daughter , and I do n't know how to deal with you , " he said . The road narrowed then to a corner , and he had to swerve to avoid a dog . I thought he would release me , but he went on holding me beside him , and when the corner was passed , and the road came straight again he did not let me go . " You can forget all I said to you this morning , " he said , " that 's all finished and done with . Do n't let 's ever think of it again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like you to do the same . You 've been formal with me long enough . " He felt for the brim of my hat , and took hold of it , throwing it over his shoulder to the back seat , and then bent down and kissed the top of my head . " Promise me you will never wear black satin , " he said . I smiled then , and he laughed back at me , and the morning was gay again , the morning was a shining thing . Mrs. Van Hopper and the afternoon did not matter a flip of the finger . It would pass so quickly , and there would be to-night , and another day to-morrow . I was cocksure , jubilant , at that moment I almost had the courage to claim equality . I saw myselfstrolling into Mrs. Van Hopper 's bedroom rather late for my bezique , and when questioned by her yawning carelessly , saying , " I forgot the time . I 've been lunching with Maxim . " I was still child enough to consider a Christian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the very first he had called me by mine . The morning , for all its shadowed moments , had promoted me to a new level of friendship , I did not lag so far behind as I had thought . He had kissed me too , a natural business , comforting and quiet . Not dramatic as in books . Not embarrassing . It seemed to bring about an44 Daphne du Maurierease in our relationship , it made everything more simple . The gulf between us had been bridged after all . I was to call him Maxim . And that afternoon playing bezique with Mrs. Van Hopper was not so tedious as it might have been , though my courage failed me and I said nothing of my morning . For when , gathering her cards togetherat the end , and reaching for the box , she said casually , " Tell me , is Max de Winter still in the hotel ? " I hesitated a moment , like a diver on the brink , then lost my nerve and my tutored selfpossession , saying , " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for his meals . " Someone has told her , I thought , someone has seen us together , the tennis professional has complained , the manager has sent a note , and I waited for her attack . But she went on putting the cards back into the box , yawning a little , while I straightened the tumbled bed . I gave her the bowl of powder , the rouge compact , and the lipstick , and she put away the cards and took up the hand glass from the table by her side . " Attractive creature , " she said , " but queertemperedI should think , difficult to know . I thought he might have made some gesture of asking one to Manderley that day in the lounge , but he was very close . " I said nothing . I watched her pick up the lip-stick and outline a bow upon her hard mouth . " I never saw her , " she said , holding the glass away to see the effect , " but I believe she was very lovely . Exquisitely turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to give tremendous parties at Manderley . It was all very sudden and tragic , and I believe he adored her . I need the darker shade of powder with this brilliant red , my dear , fetch it , will you , and put this box back in the drawer ? " And we were busy then with powder , scent , and rouge , until the bell rang and her visitors came in . I handed them their drinks , dully , saying little ; I changed the records on the gramophone , I threw away the stubs of cigarettes . " Been doing any sketching lately , little lady ? " The forced heartinessof an old banker , his monocle dangling on a string , and my bright smile of insincerity : " No , not very lately ; will you have another cigarette ? " It was not I that answered , I was not there at all . I was following a phantom in my mind , whose shadowy form had taken shape at last . Her features were blurred , her colouring indistinct , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was still uncertain , still to be revealed . REBECCA 45She had beauty that endured , and a smile that was not forgotten . Somewhere her voice still lingered , and the memory of her words . There were places she had visited , and things that she had touched . Perhaps in cupboards there were clothes that she had worn , with the scent about them still . In my bedroom , under my pillow , I had a book that she had taken in her hands , and I could see her turning to that first white page , smiling as she wrote , and shaking the bent nib . Max from Rebecca . It must have been his birthday , and she had put it amongst her other presents on the breakfast table . And they had laughed together as he tore off the paper and the string . She leant , perhaps , over his shoulder , while he read . Max . She called him Max . It was familiar , gay , and easy on the tongue . The family could call him Maxim if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself , quiet and dull and youthful , who did not matter . Max was her choice , the word was her possession , she had written it with so great a confidence on the fly-leaf of that book . That bold , slanting hand , stabbing the white paper , the symbol of herself , so certain , so assured . How many times she must have written to him thus , in how many varied moods . Little notes , scrawled on half-sheets of paper , and letters , when he was away , page after page , intimate , their news . Her voice , echoing through the house , and down the garden , careless and familiar like the writing in the book . And I had to call him Maxim. 6PACKING UP . The nagging worry of departure . Lost keys , unwritten labels , tissue paper lying on the floor . I hate it all . Even now , when I have done so much of it , when I live , as the saying goes , in my boxes . Even to-day , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the impersonal shelves of a furnished villa , is a methodicalmatter of routine , I am aware of sadness , of a sense of loss . Here , I say , we have lived , we have been happy . This has been ours , howeverbrief the time . Though two nights only have been spent be-46 Daphne du Maurierneath a roof , yet we leave something of ourselves behind . Nothing material , not a hair-pin on a dressing-table , not an empty bottle of Aspirin tablets , not a handkerchief beneath a pillow , but something indefinable , a moment of our lives , a thought , a mood . This house sheltered us , we spoke , we loved within those walls . That was yesterday . To-day we pass on , we see it no more , and we are different , changed in some infinitesimal way . We can never be quite the same again . Even stopping for luncheon at a way-side inn , and going to a dark , unfamiliar room to wash my hands , the handle of the door unknown to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cracked mirror above the basin , for this moment , it is mine , it belongs to me . We know one another . This is the present . There is no past and no future . Here I am washing my hands and the cracked mirror shows me to myself , suspended as it were , in time ; this is me , this moment will not pass . And then I open the door and go to the dining-room , where he is sitting waiting for me at a table , and I think how in that moment I have aged , and passed on , how I have advanced one step towards an unknown destiny . We smile , we choose our lunch , we speak of this and that , but  --  I say to myself  --  I am not she who left him five minutes ago . She has stayed behind . I am another woman , older , more mature ... . I saw in a paper the other day that the hotel Cote d'Azur at Monte Carlo had gone to new management , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the whole interior changed . Perhaps Mrs. Van Hopper 's suite on the first floor exists no more . Perhaps there is no trace of the small bedroom that was mine . I knew I should never go back , that day I knelt on the floor and fumbled with the awkward catch of her trunk . The episode was finished , with the snapping of the lock . I glanced out of the window , and it was like turning the page of a photograph album . Those roof tops and that sea were mine no more . They belonged to yesterday , to the past . The rooms already wore an empty air , stripped of our possessions , and there was something hungry about the suite , as though it wished us gone , and the new arrivals , who would come to-morrow , in our place . The heavy luggage stood ready strapped and locked in the corridor outside . The smaller stuff would be finished later . Waste-paper baskets groaned under litter . All her half-empty medicine bottles and discarded face-cream jars , with torn-up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bureau was stripped bare . REBECCA 47She had flung a letter at me the morning before , as I poured out her coffee at breakfast . " Helen is sailing for New York on Saturday . Little Nancy has a threatened appendix , and they 've cabled her to go home . That 's decided me . We 're going too . I 'm tired to death of Europe , and we can come back in the early fall . How d' you like the idea of seeing New York ? " The thought was worse than prison . Something of my misery must have - shown in my face , for at first she looked astonished , then annoyed . ' What an odd , unsatisfactory child you are . I ca n't make you out . Do n't you realise that at home girls in your position without any money can have the grandest fun ? Plenty of boys and excitement . All in your own class . You can have your own little set of friends , and need n't be at my beck and call as much as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for Monte ? " " I 've got used to it , " I said lamely , wretchedly , my mind a conflict . " Well , you 'll just have to get used to New York , that 's all . We 're going to catch that boat of Helen 's , and it means seeing about our passage at once . Go down to the reception office right away , and make that young clerk show some sign of efficiency . Your day will be so full that you wo n't have time to have any pangs about leaving Monte ! " She laughed disagreeably , squashing her cigarette in the butter , and went to the telephone to ring up all her friends . I could not face the office right away . I went into the bathroom and locked the door , and sat down on the cork mat , my head in my hands . It had happened at last , the business of going away . It was all over . To-morrow evening I should be in the train , holding her jewel case and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that monstrous new hat with the single quill , dwarfed in her fur-coat , sitting opposite me in the wagon-lit . We would wash and clean our teeth in that stuffy little compartment with the rattling doors , the splashed basin , the damp towel , the soap with a single hair on it , the carafe halffilledwith water , the inevitable notice on the wall " Sous le lavabo se trouve une vase , " while every rattle , every throb and jerk of the screaming train would tell me that the miles carried me away from him , sitting alone in the restaurant of the hotel , at the table I had known , reading a book , not minding , not thinking . I should say good-bye to him in the lounge , perhaps , before we left . A furtive , scrambled farewell , because of her , and there would be a pause , and a smile , and words like " Yes , of course , do write , " 48 Daphne du Maurierand " I 've never thanked you properly for being so kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " What about your address ? " ' Well , I 'll have to let you know . " And he would light a cigarette casually , asking a passing waiter for a light , while I thought , " Four and a half more minutes to go . I shall never see him again . " Because I was going , because it was over , there would suddenly be nothing more to say , we would be strangers , meeting for the last and only time , while my mind clamoured painfully , crying , " I love you so much . I 'm terribly unhappy . This has never come to me before , and never will again . " My face would be set in a prim , conventionalsmile , my voice would be saying , " Look at that funny old man over there , I wonder who he is , he must be new here . " And we would waste the last moments laughing at a stranger , because we were already strangers to one another . " I hope the snapshots come @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he " Yes , that one of the square ought to be good , the light was just right . " Having both of us gone into all that at the time , having agreed upon it , and anyway I would not care if the result was fogged and black , because this was the last moment , the final good-bye had been attained . " Well , " my dreadful smile stretching across my face , " thanks most awfully once again , it 's been so ripping . . . " using words I had never used before . Ripping : what did it mean ?  --  God knows , I did not care ; it was the sort of word that schoolgirls had for hockey , wildly inappropriate to those past weeks of misery and exultation . Then the doors of the lift would open upon Mrs. Van Hopper and I would cross the lounge to meet her , and he would stroll back again to his corner and pick up a paper . Sitting there , ridiculously , on the cork mat of the bathroom floor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and our arrival in New York . The shrill voice of Helen , a narrower edition of her mother , and Nancy , her horrid little child . The college boys that Mrs. Van Hopper would have me know , and the young bank clerks , suitable to my station . " Let 's make Wednesday night a date . " " D' you like hot music ? " Snub-nosed boys , with shiny faces . Having to be polite . And wanting to be alone with my own thoughts as I was now , locked behind the bathroom door ... . She came and rattled on the door . " What are you doing ? " " All right  --  I 'm sorry , I 'm coming now , " and I made a pretence of turning on the tap , of bustling about and folding a towel on a rail . She glanced at me curiously as I opened the door . " What a timeREBECCA 49you 've been . You ca n't afford to dream this morning , you know , there 's too much to be done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , in a few weeks , I felt certain of that . There would be a great pile of letters waiting for him in the hall , and mine amongst them , scribbled on the boat . A forced letter , trying to amuse , describing my fellow passengers . It would lie about inside his blotter , and he would answer it weeks later , one Sunday morning in a hurry , before lunch , having come across it when he paid some bills . And then no more . Nothing until the filial degradation of the Christmas card . Manderley itself perhaps , against a frosted background . The message printed , saying " A happy Christmas and a prosperous New Year from Maximilian de Winter . " Gold lettering . But to be kind he would have run his pen through the printed name and written in ink underneath " from Maxim , " as a sort of sop , and if there was space , a message , " I hope you are enjoying New York . " A lick of the envelope , a stamp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " It 's too bad you are leaving to-morrow , " said the reception clerk , telephone in hand , " the Ballet starts next week you know . Does Mrs. Van Hopper know ? " I dragged myself back from Christmas at Manderley to the realities of the wagon-lit . Mrs. Van Hopper lunched in the restaurant for the first time since her influenza , and I had a pain in the pit of my stomach as I followed her into the room . He had gone to Cannes for the day , that much I knew , for he had warned me the day before , but I kept thinking the waiter might commit an indiscretion and say : " Will Mademoiselle be dining with Monsieur to-night as usual ? " I felt a little sick whenever he came near the table , but he said nothing . The day was spent in packing , and in the evening people came to say good-bye . We dined in the sitting-room , and she went to bed directly afterwards . Still I had not seen him . I went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of getting luggage labels and he was not there . The odious reception clerk smiled when he saw me . " If you are looking for Mr. de Winter we had a message from Cannes to say he would not be back before midnight . " " I want a packet of luggage labels , " I said , but I saw by his eye that he was not deceived . So there would be no last evening after all . The hour I had looked forward to all day must be spent by myself alone , in my own bedroom , gazing at my Revelation suitcaseand the stout hold-all . Perhaps it was just as well , for I should have made a poor companion , and he must have read my face. 50 Daphne du MaurierI know I cried that night , bitter youthful tears that could not come from me to-day . That kind of crying , deep into a pillow , does not happen after we are twenty-one . The throbbing head , the swollen eyes , the tight , contracted throat . And the wild anxiety @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , sponging with cold water , dabbing eau-de-Cologne , the furtive dash of powder that is significantin itself . The panic , too , that one might cry again , the tears swelling without control , and a fatal trembling of the mouth lead one to disaster . I remember opening wide my window and leaning out , hoping the fresh morning air would blow away the tell-tale pink under the powder , and the sun had never seemed so bright , nor the day so full of promise . Monte Carlo was suddenly full of kindliness and charm , the one place in the world that held sincerity . I loved it . Affection overwhelmed me . I wanted to live there all my life . And I was leaving it to-day . This is the last time I brush my hair before the looking-glass , the last time I shall clean my teeth into the basin . Never again sleep in that bed . Never more turn off the switch of that electric light . There I was , padding about in a dressing-gown , making a slough of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't started a cold , have you ? " she said at breakfast . " No , " I told her , " I do n't think so , " clutching at a straw , for this might serve as an excuse later , if I was over-pink about the eyes . " I hate hanging about once everything is packed , " she grumbled ; we ought to have decided on the eaz'lier train . We could get it if we made the effort , and then have longer in Paris . Wire Helen not to meet us , but arrange another rendezvous . I wonder "  --  she glanced at her watch  --  " I suppose they could change the reservations . Anywayit 's worth trying . Co down to the office and see . " " Yes , " I said , a dummy to her moods , going into my bedroom and flinging off my dressing-gown , fastening my inevitable flannel skirt and stretching my home-made jumper over my head . My indifference to her turned to hatred . This was the end then , even my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the terrace , not even ten minutes perhaps to say good-bye . Because she had finished breakfast earlier than she expected , because she was bored . Well then , I would fling away restraint and modesty , I would not be proud any more . I slammed the door of the sitting-room and ran along the passage . I did not wait for the lift , I climbed the stairs , three at a time , up to the third floor . I knew the number of hisREBECCA grroom , 748 , and I hammered at the door , very flushed in the face and breathless . " Come in , " he shouted , and I opened the door , repenting already , my nerve failing me , for perhaps he had only just woken up , having been late last night , and would be still in bed , tousled in the head and irritable . He was shaving by the open window , a camel-hair jacket over his pyjamas , and I in my flannel suit and heavy shoes felt clumsy and overdressed . I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What do you want , " he said , " is something the matter ? " " I 've come to say good-bye , " I said , " we 're going this morning . " He stared at me , then put his razor down on the wash-stand . " Shut the door , " he said . I closed it behind me , and stood there , rather self-conscious , my hands hanging by my side . " What on earth are you talking about ? " he asked . " It 's true , we 're leaving to-day . We were going by the later train , and now she wants to catch the earlier one , and I was afraid I should n't see you again . I felt I must see you before I left , to thank you . " They tumbled out , the idiotic words , just as I had imagined them . I was stiff and awkward , in a moment I should say he had been ripping . " Why did n't you tell me about this before ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was all done in a hurry . Her daughter sails for New York on Saturday , and we are going with her . We 're joining her in Paris , and going through to Cherbourg . " " She 's taking you with her to New York ? " " Yes , and I do n't want to go . I shall hate it ; I shall be miserable . " " Why in heaven 's name go with her then ? " " I have to , you know that . I work for a salary . I ca n't afford to leave her . " He picked up his razor again , and took the soap off his face . " Sit down , " he said . " I sha n't be long . I 'll dress in the bathroom , and be ready in five minutes . " He took his clothes off the chair and threw them on the bathroomfloor , and went inside , slamming the door . I sat down on the bed and began biting my nails . The situation was unreal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was thinking , what he was going to do . I glanced round the room , and it was the room of any man , untidy and impersonal . Lots of shoes , more than were ever needed , and strings of ties . The dressing-table was bare , except52 Daphne du Maurierfor a large bottle of hair-wash and a pair of ivory hair-brushes . No photographs . No snapshots . Nothing like that . Instinctively I had looked for them , thinking there would be one photograph at least beside his bed , or in the middle of the mantelpiece . One large one , in a leather frame . There were only books though , and a box of cigarettes . He was ready , as he had promised , in five minutes . " Come down to the terrace while I eat my breakfast , " he said . I looked at my watch . " I have n't time , " I told him . " I ought to be in the office now , changing the reservations . " " Never mind about that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said . We walked down the corridor and he rang for the lift . He ca n't realise , I thought , that the early train leaves in about an hour and a half . Mrs. Van Hopper will ring up the office , in a moment , and ask if I am there . We went down in the lift , not talking , and so out to the terrace , where the tables were laid for breakfast . ' What are you going to have ? " he said . " I 've had mine already , " I told him , " and I can only stay four minutes anyway . " " Bring me coffee , a boiled egg , toast , marmalade , and a tangerine , " he said to the waiter . And he took an emery board out of his pocket and began filing his nails . " So Mrs. Van Hopper has had enough of Monte Carlo , " he said , " and now she wants to go home . So do I. She to New York and I to Manderley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice . " " Do n't make a joke about it , it 's unfair , " I said , " and I think I had better see about those tickets , and say good-bye now .

Either you go to America with Mrs. Van Hopper or you come home to Manderleywith me . " " Do you mean you want a secretary or something ? " " No , I 'm asking you to marry me , you little fool . " The waiter came with the breakfast , and I sat with my hands in my lap , watching while he put down the pot of coffee and the jug of milk . " You do n't understand , " I said , when the waiter had gone , " I 'm not the sort of person men marry . " REBECCA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , staring at me , laying down his spoon . I watched a fly settle on the marmalade , and he brushed it away impatiently . " I 'm not sure , " I said slowly . " I do n't think I know how to explain . I do n't belong to your sort of world for one thing . " " What is my world ? " " Well  --  Manderley . You know what I mean . " He picked up his spoon again and helped himself to marmalade . " You are almost as ignorant as Mrs. Van Hopper , and just as unintelligent . What do you know of Manderley ? I 'm the person to judge that , whether you would belong there or not . You think I ask you this on the spur of the moment , do n't you ? Because you say you do n't want to go to New York . You think I ask you to marry me for the same reason you believed I drove you about in the car , yes , and gave you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't you ? " " Yes , " I said . " One day , " he went on , spreading his toast thick , " you may realise that philanthropy is not my strongest quality . At the moment I do n't think you realise anything at all . You have n't answered my question . Are you going to marry me ? " I do n't believe , even in my fiercest moments , I had considered this possibility . I had once , when driving with him and we had been silent for many miles , started a rambling story in my head about him being very ill , delirious I think , and sending for me and I having to nurse him . I had reached the point in my story where I was putting cau-de-Cologne on his head when we arrived at the hotel , and so it finished there . And another time I had imagined living in a lodge in the grounds of Manderley , and how he would visit me sometimes , and sit in front of the fire . This sudden talk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was as though the King asked one . It did not ring true . And he went on eating his mannaladeas though everything were natural . In books men knelt to women , and it would be moonlight . Not at breakfast , not like this . " My suggestion does n't seem to have gone too well , " he said . " I 'm sorry . I rather thought you loved me . A fine blow to my conceit . " " I do love you , " I said . " I love you dreadfully . You 've made me very unhappy and I 've been crying all night because I thought I should never see you again . " When I said this I remember he laughed , and stretched his hand54 Daphne du Maurierto me across the breakfast table . " Bless you for that , " he said ; " one day , when you reach that exalted age of thirty-five which you told me was your ambition , I 'll remind you of this moment . And you wo n't believe me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I was ashamed already , and angry with him for laughing . So women did not make those confessions to men . I had a lot to learn . " So that 's settled , is n't it ? " he said , going on with his toast and marmalade ; " instead of being companion to Mrs. Van Hopper you become mine , and your duties will be almost exactly the same . I also like new library books , and flowers in the drawing-room , and bezique after dinner . And someone to pour out my tea . The only difference is that I do n't take Taxol , I prefer Eno 's , and you must never let me run out of my particular brand of tooth-paste . " I drummed with my fingers on the table , uncertain of myself and of him . Was he still laughing at me , was it all a joke ? He looked up , and saw the anxiety on my face . " I 'm being rather a brute to you , are n't I ? " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ proposal . We ought to be in a conservatory , you in a white frock with a rose in your hand , and a violin playing a waltz in the distance . And I should make violent love to you behind a palm tree . You would feel then you were getting your money 's worth . Poor darling , what a shame . Never mind , I 'll take you to Venice for our honeymoon and we 'll hold hands in the gondola . But we wo n't stay too long , because I want to show you Manderley . " He wanted to show me Manderley . . . . And suddenly I realised that it would all happen , I would be his wife , we would walk in the garden together , we would stroll down that path in the valley to the shingle beach . I knew how I would stand on the steps after breakfast , looking at the day , throwing crumbs to the birds , and later wander out in a shady hat with long scissors in my hand , and cut flowers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bought that picture post-card as a child , it was a premonition , a blank step into the future . He wanted to show me Manderley . . . . My mind ran riot then , figures came before me and picture after picture  --  and all the while he ate his tangerine , giving me a piece now and then , and watching me . We would be in a crowd of people , and he would say , " I do n't think you have met my wife . " Mrs. de Winter . I would be Mrs. de Winter . I considered my name , and the signature on cheques , to tradesmen , and in letters asking people to dinner . I heard myself talking on the telephone " Why not come down to Manderley nextREBECCA 55week-end ? " People , always a throng of people . " Oh , but she 's simply charming , you must meet her --  " This about me , a whisper on the fringe of a crowd , and I would turn away , pretending I had not heard . Going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , grapes and peaches for the old lady who was sick . Her hands stretched out to me , " The Lord bless you , Madam , for being so good , " and my saying " Just send up to the house for anything you want . " Mrs. de Winter . I would be Mrs. de Winter . I saw the polished table in the dini , ng-room , and the long candles . Maxim sitting at the end . A party of twenty-four . I had a flower in my hair . Everyone looked towards me , holding up his glass . " We must drink the health of the bride , " and Maxim saying afterwards , " I have never seen you look so lovely . " Great cool rooms , filled with flowers . My bedroom , with a fire in the winter , someone knocking at the door . And a woman comes in , smiling , she is Maxim 's sister , and she is saying , " It 's really wonderfulhow happy you have made him , everyone is so pleased , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I would be Mrs. de Winter . " The rest of the tangerine is sour , I should n't eat it , " he said , and I stared at him , the words going slowly to my head , then looked down at the fruit on my plate . The quarter was hard and pale . He was right . The tangerine was very sour . I had a sharp , bitter taste in my mouth , and I had only just noticed it . " Am I going to break the news to Mrs. Van Hopper or are you ? " he said . He was folding up his napkin , pushing back his plate , and I wondered how it was he spoke so casually , as though the matter was of little consequence , a mere adjustment of plans . Whereas to me it was a bombshell , exploding in a thousand fragments . " You tell her , " I said , " she 'll be so angry . " We got up from the table , I excited and flushed , trembling already in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , take my arm smilingly and say , " You must congratulate us , Mademoiselle and I are going to be married . " And all the other waiters would hear , would bow to us , would smile , and we would pass into the lounge , a wave of excitement following us , a flutter of expectation . But he said nothing . He left the terrace without a word , and I followed him to the lift . We passed the reception desk and no one even looked at us . The clerk was busy with a sheaf of papers , he was talking over his shoulder to his junior . He does not know , I thought , that I am going to be Mrs. de Winter . I am going to live at Manderley . Manderley will belong to me . We went up in the lift to the first56 Daphne du Maurier REBECCA 57floor , and so along the passage . He took my hand and swung it as we went along . " Does forty-two seem very old to you ? " he said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , quickly , too eagerly perhaps . " I do n't like young men . " " You 've never known any , " he said . We came to the door of the suite . " I think I had better deal with this alone , " he said ; " tell me something  --  do you mind how soon you marry me ? You do n't want a trousseau , do you , or any of that nonsense ? Because the whole thing can be so easily arranged in a few days . Over a desk , with a licence , and then off in the car to Venice or anywhere you fancy . " " Not in a church ? " I asked . " Not in white , with bridesmaids , and bells , and choir boys ? What about your relations , and all your friends ? " " You forget , " he said , " I had that sort of wedding before . " We went on standing in front of the door of the suite , and I noticed that the daily paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too busy to read it at breakfast . " Well ? " he said , " what about it ? " " Of course , " I answered , " I was thinking for the moment we would be married at home . Naturally I do n't expect a church , or people , or anything like that . " And I smiled at him . I made a cheerful face . " Wo n't it be fun ? " I said . He had turned to the door though , and opened it , and we were inside the suite in the little entrance passage . " Is that you ? " called Mrs. Van Hopper from the sitting-room , " what in the name of Mike have you been doing ? I 've rang the office three times and they said they had n't seen you . " I was seized with a sudden desire to laugh , to cry , to do both , and I had a pain , too , at the pit of my stomach . I wished , for one wild moment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ somewhere , going for a walk , and whistling . " I 'm afraid it 's all my fault , " he said , going into the sitting-room , shutting the door behind him , and I heard her exclamation of surprise . Then I went into my bedroom and sat down by the open window . It was like waiting in the ante-room at a doctor 's . I- ought to turn over the pages of a magazine , look at photographs that did not matter and read articles I should never remember , until the nurse came , bright and efficient , all humanity washed away by years ofdisinfectant : " It 's all right , the operation was quite successful . There is no need to worry at all . I should go home and have some sleep . " The walls of the suite were thick , I could hear no hum of voices . I wondered what he was saying to her , how he phrased his words . Perhaps he said , " I fell in love with her , you know , the very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ another every day . " And she in answer , " Why , Mr. de Winter , it 's quite the most romantic thing I 've ever . heard . " Romantic , that was the word I had tried to remempercoming up in the lift . Yes , of course . Romantic . That was what people would say . It was all very sudden and romantic . They suddenly decided to get married and there it was . Such an adventure . I smiled to myself as I hugged my knees on the window seat , thinkinghow wonderful it was , how happy I was going to be . I was to marry the man I loved . I was to be Mrs. de Winter . It was foolish to go on having that pain in the pit of my stomach when I was so happy . Nerves of course . Waiting like this ; the doctor 's anteroom . It would have been better , after all , more natural surely to have gone into the sitting-room hand in hand , laughing , smiling at one another and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ married , we 're very much in love . " In love . He had not said anything yet about being in love . No time perhaps . It was all so hurried at the breakfast table . Marmalade , and coffee , and that tangerine . No time . The tangerine was very bitter . No , he had not said anything about being in love . Just that we would be married . Short and definite , very original . Original proposals were much better . More genuine . Not like other people . Not like younger men who talked nonsense probably , not meaning half they said . Not like younger men being very incoherent , very passionate , swearing impossibilities . Not like him the first time , askingRebecca . . . . I must not think of that . Put it away . A thought forbidden , prompted by demons . Get thee behind me , Satan . I must never think about that , never , never , never . He loves me , he wants to show me Manderley . Would they ever have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the room ? There was the book of poems lying beside my bed . He had forgottenhe had ever lent them to me . They could not mean much to him then . " Go on , " whispered the demon , " open the title-page , that 's what you want to do , is n't it ? Open the title-page . " Nonsense , I said , I 'm only going to put the book with the rest of the things . I yawned , I wandered to the table beside the bed . I picked up the book . I caught my foot in the flex of the bedside lamp , and stumbled , 58 Daphne du Maurierthe book falling from my hands on to the floor . It fell open , at the title-page . " Max from Rebecca . " She was dead , and one must not have thoughts about the dead . They slept in peace , the grass blew over their graves . How alive was her writing though , how full of force . Those curious , sloping letters . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if it had been written yesterday . I took my nail scissors from the dressing-case and cut the page , looking over my shoulder like a criminal . I cut the page right out of the book . I left no jagged edges , and the book looked white and clean when the page was gone . A new book , that had not been touched . I tore the page up in many little fragments and threw them into the waste-paper basket . Then I went and sat on the window seat again . But I kept thinking of the torn scraps in the basket , and after a moment I had to get up and look in the basket once more . Even now the ink stood up on the fragments thick and black , the writing was not destroyed . I took a box of matches and set fire to the fragments . The flame had a lovely light , staining the paper , curling the edges , making the slantingwriting impossible to distinguish . The fragments fluttered to grey ashes . The letter R was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it curled outwards for a moment , becoming larger than ever . Then it crumpled too ; the flame destroyed it . It was not ashes even , it was feathery dust . . . . I went and washed my hands in the basin . I felt better , much better . I had the clean , new feeling that one has when the calendar is hung on the wall at the beginning of the year . January the 1st . I was aware of the same freshness , the same gay confidence . The door opened and he came into the room . " All 's well , " he said ; " shock made her speechless at first , but she 's beginning to recover , so I 'm going downstairs to the office , to make certain she will catch the first train . For a moment she wavered , I think she had hopes of acting witness at the wedding , but I was very firm . Go and talk to her . " He said nothing about being glad , about being happy . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with me . He smiled , and waved his hand , and went off down the corridor alone . I went to Mrs. Van Hopper , uncertain , rather self-conscious , like a maid who has handed in her notice through a friend . She was standing by the window , smoking a cigarette , an odd , dumpy little figure I should not see again , her coat stretched tight over her large breasts , her ridiculous hat perched sideways on her head . REBECCA 59 " Well , " she said I 've got to hand it to you for a doubletimeworker . Still waters certainly run deep in your case . How did you manage it ? " I did not know what to answer . I did not like her smile . " It was a lucky thing for you I had the influenza , " she said . " I realise now how you spent your days , and why you were so forgetful . Tennis lessons my eye . You might have told me , you know . " " I 'm sorry , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran her eyes over my figure . " And he tells me he wants to marry you in a few days . Lucky again for you that you have n't a family to ask questions . Well , it 's nothing to do with me any more , I wash my hands of the whole affair . I rather wonder what his friends will think , but I suppose that 's up to him . You realise he 's years older than you ? " " He 's only forty-two , " I said , " and I 'm old for my age . " She laughed , she dropped cigarette ash on the floor . " You certainly are , " she said . She went on looking at me in a way she had never done before . Appraising me , running her eyes over my points like a judge at a cattle show . There was something inquisitive about her eyes , something unpleasant . " Tell me , " she said , intimate , a friend to a friend , " have you been doing anything you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dressmaker , who had offered me that ten per cent . " I do n't know what you mean , " I said . She laughed , she shrugged her shoulders . " Oh , well . . . never mind . But I always said English girls were dark horses , for all their hockey-playing attitude . So I 'm supposed to travel to Paris alone , and leave you here while your beau gets a marriage licence ? I notice he does n't ask me to the wedding . " " I do n't think he wants anyone , and anyway you would have sailed , " I said . " H 'm , h 'm , " she said . She took out her vanity case and began powdering her nose . " I suppose you really do know your own mind , " she went on ; " after all , the whole thing has been very hurried , has n't it ? A matter of a few weeks . I do n't suppose he 's too easy , and you 'll have to adapt yourself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to now , you know , and you ca n't say that I 've run you off your feet . You will have your work cut out as mistress ofManderley . To be perfectly frank , my dear , I simply ca n't see you doing it . " Her words sounded like the echo of my own an hour before . " You have n't the experience , " she continued , " you do n't know that milieu . You can scarcely string two sentences together at my bridge teas , what are you going to say to all his friends ? The Man- derley parties were famous when she was alive . Of course he 's told you all about them ? " I hesitated , but she went on , thank heaven , not waiting for my answer . " Naturally one wants you to be happy , and I grant you he 's a very attractive creature but  --  well , I 'm sorry ; and personally I think you are making a big mistake  --  one you will bitterly regret " She put down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her shoulder . Perhaps she was being sincere at last , but I did not want that sort of honesty . I did not say anything . I looked sullen , perhaps , for she shrugged her shoulders and wandered to the looking-glass , straightening her little mushroom hat . I was glad she was going , glad I should not see her again . I grudged the months I had spent with her , employed by her , taking her money , trotting in her wake like a shadow , drab and dumb . Of course I was inexperienced , of course I was idiotic , shy and young . I knew all that . She did not have to tell me . I supposed her attitude was deliberate , and for some odd feminine reason she resented this marriage , her scale of values had received a shock . Well , I would not care , I would forget her and her barbed words . A new confidence had been born in me when I burnt that page and scattered the fragments . The past would not exist for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I. The past had blown away like the ashes in the waste-paper basket . I was going to be Mrs. de Winter . I was going to live at Manderley . Soon she would be gone , rattling alone in the wagon-lit without me , and he and I would be together in the dining-room of the hotel , lunching at the same table , planning the future . The brink of a big adventure . Perhaps , once she had gone , he would talk to me at last , about loving me , about being happy . Up to now there had been no time , and anyway those things are not easily said , they must wait their moment . I looked up , and caught her reflection in the looking-glass . She was watching me , a little tolerant smile on her lips . I thought she was going to be generous after all , hold out her hand and wish me luck , give me encouragement and tell me that everything was going to be all right . But she went on smiling twisting a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , " she said , " you know why he is marrying you , do n't you ? You have n't flattered yourself he 's in love with you ? The fact is that empty house got on his nerves to such an extent he nearly went off his head . He admitted as much before you came into the room . He just ca n't go on living there alone .... " 7WE CAME TO Manderley in early May , arriving , so Maxim said , with the first swallows and the bluebells . It would be the best moment , before the full Rush of summer , and in the valley the azaleas would be prodigal of scent , and the blood-red rhododendrons in bloom . We motored , I remember , leaving London in the morning in a heavy shower of rain , coming to Manderley about five o'clock , in time foi tea . I can see myself now , unsuitably dressed as usual , although a bride of seven weeks , in a tan-coloured stockinette frock , a small fur known as a stone marten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , far too big for me and dragging to my ankles . It was , I thought , a gesture to the weather , and the length added inches to my height . I clutched a pair of gauntlet gloves in my hands , and carried a large leather handbag . " This is London rain , " said Maxim when we left , " you wait , the sun will be shining for you when we come to Manderley " ; and he was right , for the clouds left us at Exeter , they rolled away behind us , leaving a great blue sky above our heads and a white road in front of us . I was glad to see the sun , for in superstitious fashion I looked upon rain as an omen of ill-will , and the leaden skies of London had made me silent . " Feeling better ? " said Maxim , and I smiled at him , taking hiE hand , thinking how easy it was for him , going to his own home , wandering into the hall , picking up letters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how much he guessed of my nervousness , and whether his question " Feeling better ? " meant that he understood. 6z Daphne du Maurier " Never mind , we 'll soon be there . I expect you want your tea , " he said , and he let go my hand because we had reached a bend in the road , and must slow down . I knew then that he had mistaken my silence for fatigue , and it had not occurred to him I dreaded this arrival at Manderley as much as I had longed for it in theory . Now the moment was upon me I wished it delayed , I wanted to draw up at some way-side inn and stay there , in a coffee-room , by an impersonal fire . I wanted to be a traveller on the road , a bride in love with her husband . Not myself coming to Manderley for the first time , the wife of Maxim de Winter . We passed many friendly villages where the cottage windows had a kindly air . A woman , holding a baby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while a man clanked across a road to a well , carrying a pail . I wished we could have been one with them , perhaps their neighbours , and that Maxim could lean over a cottage gate in the evenings , smoking a pipe , proud of a very tall hollyhock he had grown himself , while I bustled in my kitchen , clean as a pin , laying the table for supper . There would be an alarm clock on the dresser ticking loudly , and a row of shining plates , while after supper Maxim would read his paper , boots on the fender , and I reach for a great pile of mending in the dresser drawer . Surely it would be peaceful and steady , that way of living , and easier , too , demanding no set standard ? " Only two miles further , " said Maxim ; " you see that great belt of trees on the brow of the hill there , sloping to the valley , with a scrap of sea beyond ? That 's Manderley , in there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and did not answer him , aware now of a stab of panic , an uneasy sickness that could not be controlled . Gone was my glad excitement , vanished my happy pride . I was like a child brought to her first school , or a little untrained maid who has never left home before , seeking a situation . Any measure of self-possession I had gained hitherto , during the brief seven weeks of marriage , was like a rag now , fluttering before the wind ; it seemed to me that even the most elementary knowledge of behaviour was unknown to me now , I should not know my right hand from my left , whether to stand or sit , what spoons and forks to use at dinner . " I should shed that mackintosh , " he said , glancing down at me , " it has not rained down here at all , and put your funny little furREBECCA 63straight . Poor lamb , I 've bustled you down here like this , and you probably ought to have bought a lot of clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , as long as you do n't mind , " I said . " Most women think of nothing but clothes , " he said absently , and turning a corner we came to a cross-road , and the beginning of a high wall . " Here we are , " he said , a new note of excitement in his voice , and I gripped the leather seat of the car with my two hands . The road curved , and before us , on the left , were two high iron gates beside a lodge , open wide to the long drive beyond . As we drove through I saw faces peering through the dark window of the lodge , and a child ran round from the back , staring curiously . I shrank back against the seat , my heart beating quickly , knowing why the faces were at the window , and why the child stared . They wanted to see what I was like . I could imagine them now , talking excitedly , laughing in the little kitchen . " Only caught sight of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she would n't show her face . Oh , well , we 'll know by to-morrow . Word will come from the house . " Perhaps he guessed something of my shyness at last for he took my hand , and kissed it , and laughed a little , even as he spoke . " You must n't mind if there 's a certain amount of curiosity , " he said , " everyone will want to know what you are like . They have probably talked of nothing else for weeks . You 've only got to be yourself and they will all adore you . And you do n't have to worry about the house , Mrs. Danvers does everything . Just leave it all to her . She 'll be stiff with you at first , I dare say , she 's an extraordinary character , but you must n't let it worry you . It 's just her manner . See those shrubs ? It 's like a blue wall along here when the hydrangeas are in bloom . " I did not answer him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ago bought a picture post-card in a village shop , and came out into the bright sunlight twisting it in her hands , pleased with her purchase , thinking " This will do for my album . Manderley , ' what a lovely name . " And now I belonged here , this was my home , I would write letters to people saying , " We shall be down at Manderley all the summer , you must come and see us , " and I would walk along this drive , strange and unfamiliar to me now , with perfect knowledge , conscious of every twist and turn , marking and approving where the gardeners had worked , here a cutting back of the shrubs , there a lopping of a branch , calling at the lodge by the iron gates on some friendly errand , saying , " Well , how 's the leg to-day ? " while64 Daphne du Maurierthe old woman , curious no longer , bade me welcome to her kitchen . I envied Maxim , careless and at ease , and the little smile on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ home . It seemed remote to me , and far too distant , the time when I too should smile and be at ease , and I wished it could come quickly , that I could be old even , with grey hair , and slow of step , having lived here many years , anything but the timid , foolish creature I felt myself to be . The gates had shut to with a crash behind us , the dusty highroadwas out of sight , and I became aware that this was not the drive I had imagined would be Manderley 's , this was not a broad and spacious thing of gravel , flanked with neat turf at either side , kept smooth with rake and brush . This drive twisted and turned as a serpent , scarce wider in places than a path , and above our heads was a great colonnade of trees , whose branches nodded and intermingled with one another , making an archway for us , like the roof of a church . Even the midday sun would not penetrate the interlacing of those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with another , and only little flickeringpatches of warm light would come in intermittent waves to dapple the drive with gold . It was very silent , very still . On the high-road there had been a gay west wind blowing in my face , making the grass on the hedges dance in unison , but here there was no wind . Even the engine of the car had taken a new note , throbbing low , quieter than before . As the drive descended to the valley so the trees came in upon us , great beeches with lovely smooth white stems , lifting their myriad branches to one another , and other trees , trees I could not name , coming close , so close that I could touch them with my hands . On we went , over a little bridge that spanned a narrow stream , and still this drive that was no drive twisted and turned like an enchanted ribbon through the dark and silent woods , penetrating even deeper to the very heart surely of the forest itself , and still there was no clearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it began to nag at my nerves , it must be this turn , I thought , or round that further bend , but as I leant forward in my seat I was forever disappointed , there was no house , no field , no broad and friendly garden , nothing but the silence and deep woods . The lodge gates were a memory , and the high-road something belonging to another time , another world . Suddenly I saw a clearing in the dark drive ahead , and a patchREBECCA 65of sky , and in a moment the dark trees had thinned , the nameless shrubs had disappeared , and on either side of us was a wall of colour , blood-red , reaching far above our heads . We were amongst the rhododendrons . There was something bewildering , even shocking , about the suddenness of their discovery . The woods had not prepared me for them . They startled me with their crimson faces , massed one upon the other in incredible profusion , showing no leaf , no twig , nothing but the slaughterous red , luscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . I glanced at Maxim . He was smiling . " Like them ? " he said . I told him " Yes , " a little breathlessly , uncertain whether I was speaking the truth or not , for to me a rhododendron was a homely , domestic thing , strictly conventional , mauve or pink in colour , standingone beside the other in a neat round bed . And these were monsters , rearing to the sky , massed like a battalion , too beautiful I thought , too powerful , they were not plants at all . We were not far from the house now , I saw the drive broaden to the sweep I had expected , and with the blood-red wall still flankingus on either side , we turned the last corner , and so came to Manderley . Yes , there it was , the Manderley I had expected , the Manderley of my picture post-card long ago . A thing of grace and beauty , exquisite and faultless , lovelier even than I had ever dreamed , built in its hollow of smooth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gardens , and the gardens to the sea . As we drove up to the wide stone steps and stopped before the open door , I saw through one of the mullioned windows that the hall was full of people , and I heard Maxim swear under his breath . " Damn that woman , " he said , " she knows perfectly well I did not want this sort of thing , " and he put on the brakes with a jerk . " What 's the matter ? " I said , " who are all those people ? " " I 'm afraid you will have to face it now , " he said , in irritation . " Mrs. Danvers has collected the whole damned staff in the house and on the estate to welcome us . It 's all right , you wo n't have to say anything , I 'll do it all . " I fumbled for the handle of the door , feeling slightly sick , and cold now too from the long drive , and as I fumbled with the catch the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he opened the door for me . He was old , he had a kind face , and I smiled up at him , holding out my hand , but I do n't think he could have seen , for he took the66 Daphne du Maurierrug instead , and my small dressing-case , and turned to Maxim , helping me from the car at the same time . " Well , here we are , Frith , " said Maxim , taking off his gloves , " it was raining when we left London . You do n't seem to have had it here . Everyone well ? " " Yes , sir , thank you , sir . No , we have had a dry month on the whole . Glad to see you home , and hope you have been keeping well . And Madam too . " " Yes , we are both well , thank you , Frith . Rather tired from the drive , and wanting our tea . I did n't expect this business . " He jerked his head to the hall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said the man , his face expressionless . " I might have guessed it , " said Maxim abruptly , " come on , " he turned to me , " it wo n't take long , and then you shall have your tea . " We went together up the flight of steps , Frith and the footman following with the rug and my mackintosh , and I was aware of a little pain at the pit of my stomach , and a nervous contraction in my throat . I can close my eyes now , and look back on it , and see myself as I must have been , standing on the threshold of the house , a slim , awkward figure in my stockinette dress , clutching in my sticky hands a pair of gauntlet gloves . I can see the great stone hall , the wide doors open to the library , the Peter Lelys and the Vandykes on the walls , the exquisite staircase leading to the minstrels ' gallery , and there , ranged one behind the other in the hall , over-flowing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sea of faces , openmouthedand curious , gazing at me as though they were the watchingcrowd about the block , and I the victim with my hands behind my back . Someone advanced from the sea of faces , someone tall and gaunt , dressed in deep black , whose prominent cheek-bones and great , hollow eyes gave her a skull 's face , parchment-white , set on a skeleton 's frame . She came towards me , and I held out my hand , envying her for her dignity and her composure ; but when she took my hand hers was limp and heavy , deathly cold , and it lay in mine like a lifeless thing . " This is Mrs. Danvers , " said Maxim , and she began to speak , still leaving that dead hand in mine , her hollow eyes never leaving my eyes , so that my own wavered and would not meet hers , and as they did so her hand moved in mine , the life returned to it , and I was aware of a sensation of discomfort and of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I know that she bade me welcome to Manderley , in the name of herself and the staff , a stiff , conventional speech rehearsed for the occasion , spoken in a voice as cold and lifeless as her hands had been . When she had finished she waited , as though for a reply , and I remember blushing scarlet , stammering some sort of thanks in return , and dropping both my gloves in my confusion . She stooped to pick them up , and as she handed them to me I saw a little smile of scorn upon her lips , and I guessed at once she considered me ill-bred . Something , in the expression of her face , gave me a feeling of unrest , and even when she had stepped back , and taken her place amongst the rest , I could see that black figure standing out alone , individual and apart , and for all her silence I knew her eye to be upon me . Maxim took my arm and made a little speech of thanks , perfectly easy and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was no effort to him at all , and then he bore me off to the library to tea , closing the doors behind us , and we were alone again . Two cocker spaniels came from the fireside to greet us . They pawed at Maxim , their long , silken ears strained back with affection , their noses questing his hands , and then they left him and came to me , sniffing at my heels , rather uncertain , rather suspicious . One was the mother , blind in one eye , and soon she had enough of me , and took herself with a grunt to the fire again , but jasper , the younger , put his nose into my hand , and laid a chin upon my knee , his eyes deep with meaning , his tail a-thump when I stroked his silken ears . I felt better when I had taken my hat off , and my wretched little fur , and thrown them both beside my gloves and my bag on to the window seat . It was a deep , comfortable room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sort of room a man would move from never , did he live alone ; solid chairs beside a great open fire-place , baskets for the two dogs in which I felt they never sat , for the hollows in the chairs had tell-tale marks . The long windows looked out upon the lawns , and beyond the lawns to the distant shimmer of the sea . There was an old quiet smell about the room , as though the air in it was little changed , for all the sweet lilac scent and the roses brought to it throughout the early summer . Whatever air came to this room , whether from the garden or from the sea , would lose its first freshness , becoming part of the unchanging room itself , one68 Daphne du Maurierwith the books , musty and never read , one with the scrolled ceiling , the dark panelling , the heavy curtains . It was an ancient mossy smell , the smell of a silent church where services are seldom held , where rusty lichen grows upon the stones and ivy tendrils creep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a room for meditation . Soon tea was brought to us , a stately little performance enacted by Frith and the young footman , in which I played no part until they had gone , and while Maxim glanced through his great pile of letters I played with two dripping crumpets , crumbled cake with my hands , and swallowed my scalding tea . Now and again he looked up at me and smiled , and then returned to his letters , the accumulation of the last months I supposed , and I thought how little I knew of his life here at Manderley , of how it went , day by day , of the people he knew , of his friends , men and women , of what bills he paid , what orders he gave about his household . The last weeks had gone so swiftly , and I  --  driving by his side through France and Italy  --  thought only of how I loved him , seeing Venice with his eyes , echoing his words , asking no questions of the past and future , content with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was gayer than I had thought , more tender than I had dreamed , youthful and ardent in a hundred happy ways , not the Maxim I had first met , not the stranger who sat alone at the table in the restaurant , staring before him , wrapped in his secret self . My Maxim laughed and sang , threw stones into the water , took my hand , wore no frown between his eyes , carried no burden on his shoulder . I knew him as a lover , as a friend , and during those weeks I had forgotten that he had a life , orderly , methodical , a life which must be taken up again , continued as before , making vanished weeks a brief discarded holiday . I watched him read his letters , saw him frown at one , smile at another , dismiss the next with no expression , and but for the grace of God I thought , my letter would be lying there , written from New York , and he would read it in the same indifferent fashion , puzzled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it with a yawn to the pile of others in the basket , reaching for his cup of tea . The knowledge of this chilled me , how narrow a chance had stood between me and what might-have-been , for he would have sat there to his tea , as he sat now , continuing his home life as he would in any case , and perhaps he would not have thought of me much , notREBECCA 69with regret anyway , while I , in New York , playing bridge with Mrs. Van Hopper would wait day after day for a letter that never came . I leant back in my chair , glancing about the room , trying to instil into myself some measure of confidence , some genuine realisationthat I was here , at Manderley , the house of the picture postcard , the Manderley that was famous ; I had to teach myself that all this was mine now , mine as much as his , the deep chair I was sitting in , that mass of books stretching to the ceiling , the pictures on the walls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read about , all of this was mine now because I was married to Maxim . We should grow old here together , we should sit like this to our tea as old people , Maxim and I , with other dogs , the successors of these , and the library would wear the same ancient musty smell that it did now . It would know a period of glorious shabbiness and wear when the boys were young  --  our boys  --  for I saw them sprawling on the sofa with muddy boots , bringing with them always a litter of rods , and cricket bats , great clasp-knives , bows-and-arrows . On the table there , polished now and plain , an ugly case would stand containing butterflies and moths , and another one with birds ' eggs , wrapped in cotton wool . " Not all this junk in here , " I would say , " take them to the schoolroom , darlings , " and they would run off , shouting , calling to one another , but the little one staying behind , pottering on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ disturbed by the opening of the door , and Frith came in with the footman to clear the tea . " Mrs. Danvers wondered , Madam , whether you would like to see your room , " he said to me when the tea had been taken away . Maxim glanced up from his letters . " What sort of job have they made of the east wing ? " he said . " Very nice indeed , sir , it seems to me ; the men made a mess when they were working , of course , and for a time Mrs. Danvers was rather afraid it would not be finished by your return . But they cleared out last Monday . I should imagine you would be very comfortablethere , sir , it 's a lot lighter of course on that side of the house . " " Have you been making alterations ? " I asked . " Oh , nothing much , " said Maxim briefly , " only redecorating and painting the suite in the east wing , which I thought we would use for ours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on that side of the house , and it has a lovely view of the rose-garden . It was the visitors ' wing when my mother was alive . I 'll just finish these letters70 Daphne du Maurierand then I 'll come up and join you . Run along and make friends with Mrs. Danvers , it 's a good opportunity . " I got up slowly , my old nervousness returning , and went out into the hall . I wished I could have waited for him , and then , taking his arm , seen the rooms together . I did not want to go alone , with Mrs. Danvers . How vast the great hall looked now that it was empty . My feet rang on the flagged stones , echoing to the ceiling , and I felt guilty at the sound , as one does in church , self-conscious , aware of the same constraint . My feet made a stupid pitter-patter as I walked , and I thought that Frith , with his felt soles , must have thought me foolish . " It 's very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too brightly , too forced , a schoolgirlstill , but he answered me in all solemnity . " Yes , Madam , Manderleyis a big place . Not so big as some , of course , but big enough . This was the old banqueting hall , in old days . It is used still on great occasions , such as a big dinner , or a ball . And the public are admitted here , you know , once a week . " " Yes , " I said , still aware of my loud footsteps , feeling , as I followed him , that he considered me as he would one of the public visitors , and I behaved like a visitor too , glancing politely to right and left , taking in the weapons on the wall , and the pictures , touching the carved staircase with my hands . A black figure stood waiting for me at the head of the stairs , the hollow eyes watching me intently from the white skull 's face . I looked round for the stolid Frith , but he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was alone now with Mrs. Danvers . I went up the great stairs towards her , and she waited motionless , her hands folded before her , her eyes never leaving my face . I summoned a smile , which was not returned , nor did I blame her , for there was no purpose to the smile , it was a silly thing , bright and artificial . " I hope I have n't kept you waiting , " I said . " It 's for you to make your own time , Madam , " she answered , " I 'm here to carry out your orders , " and then she turned , through the archway of the gallery , to the corridor beyond . We went along a broad , carpeted passage , and then turned left , through an oak door , and down a narrow flight of stairs and up a corresponding flight , and so to another door . This she flung open , standing aside to let me pass , and I came to a little ante-room , or boudoir , furnished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which opened out to a large double bedroom with wide windows , and a bathroom beyond . IREBECCA 71went at once to the window , and looked out . The rose-garden lay below , and the eastern part of the terrace , while beyond the rosegardenrose a smooth grass bank , stretching to the near woods . " You ca n't see the sea from here then , " I said , turning to Mrs. Danvers . " No , not from this wing , " she answered , " you ca n't even hear it , either . You would not know the sea was anywhere near , not from this wing . " She spoke in a peculiar way , as though something lay behind her words , and she laid an emphasis on the words , " this wing , " as if suggesting that the suite where we stood now held some inferiority . " I 'm sorry about that , I like the sea , " I said . She did not answer , she just went on staring at me , her hands folded before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , " I said , " and I 'm sure I shall be comfortable . I understand that it 's been done up for our return . " " Yes , " she said . " What was it like before ? " I asked . " It had a mauve paper , and different hangings ; Mr. de Winter did not think it very cheerful . It was never much used , except for occasional visitors . But Mr. de Winter gave special orders in his letter that you would have this room . " " Then this was not his bedroom originally ? " I said . " No , Madam , he 's never used the rooms in this wing before . " " Oh , " I said , " he did n't tell me that , " and I wandered to the dressing-table and began combing my hair . My things were already unpacked , my brushes and comb upon the tray . I was glad Maxim had given me a set of brushes , and that they were laid out there , upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , they had cost money , I need not be ashamed of them . " Alice has unpacked for you and will look after you until your maid arrives , " said Mrs. Danvers . I smiled at her again , I put down the brush upon the dressing-table . " I do n't have a maid , " I said awkwardly , " I 'm sure Alice , if she is the housemaid , will look after me all right . " She wore the same expression that she had done on our first meeting , when I dropped my gloves so gauchely on the floor . " I 'm afraid that would not do for very long , " she said , " it 's usual , you know , for ladies in your position , to have a personal maid . " I flushed , and reached for my brush again . There was a sting in72 Daphne du Monierher words I understood too well . " If you think it necessary perhaps you would see about it for me , " I said , avoiding her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " If you wish , " she said . " It 's for you to say . " There was silence between us , I wished she would go away . I wondered why she must go on standing there , watching me , her hands folded on her black dress . " I suppose you have been at Manderley for many years , " I said , making a fresh effort , " longer than anyone else ? " " Not so long as Frith , " she said , and I thought how lifeless her voice was , and cold , like her hand when it had lain in mine ; " Frith was here when the old gentleman was living , when Mr. de Winter was a boy . " " I see , " I said , " so you did not come till after that ? " " No , " she said , " not till after that . " Once more I glanced up at her , and once more I met her eyes , dark and sombre , in that white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not why , a strange feeling of disquiet , of foreboding . I tried to smile , and could not , I found myself held by those eyes , that had no light , no flicker of sympathy towards me . " I came here when the first Mrs. de Winter was a bride , " she said , and her voice , which had hitherto , as I said , been dull and toneless , was harsh now with unexpected animation , with life and meaning , and there was a spot of colour on the gaunt cheek-bones . The change was so sudden that I was shocked , and a little scared . I did not know what to do , or what to say . It was as though she had spoken words that were forbidden , words that she had hidden within herself for a long time and now would be repressed no longer . Still her eyes never left my face , they looked upon me with a curious mixture of pity and of scorn , until I felt myself to be even younger and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I could see she despised me , marking with all the snobbery of her class that I was no great lady , that I was humble , shy , and diffident . Yet there was something beside scorn in those eyes of hers , something surely of positive dislike , or actual malice ? I had to say something , I could not go on sitting there , playing with my hair-brush , letting her see how much I feared and mistrustedher . " Mrs. Danvers , " I heard myself saying , " I hope we shall be friends and come to understand one another . You must have patience with me , you know , because this sort of life is new to me , I 've livedREBECCA 73rather differently . And I do want to make a success of it , and above all to make Mr. de Winter happy . I know I can leave all household arrangements to you , Mr. de Winter said so , and you must just run things as they have always been run , I sha n't want to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still uncertain of myself and whether I was saying the right thing , and when I looked up again I saw that she had moved , and was standing with her hand on the handle of the do9r . " Very good , " she said ; " I hope I shall do everything to your satisfaction . The house has been in my charge now for more than a year , and Mr. de Winter has never complained . It was very different of course when the late Mrs. de Winter was alive , there was a lot of entertaining then , a lot of parties , and though I managed for her she liked to supervise things herself . " Once again I had the impression that she chose her words with care , that she was feeling her way , as it were , into my mind , and watching for the effect upon my face . " I would rather leave it to you , " I repeated , " much rather , " and into her face came the same expression I had noticed before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hall , a look surely of derision , of definite contempt . She knew that I would never withstandher , and that I feared her too . " Can I do anything more for you ? " she said , and I pretended to glance round the room . " No , " I said . " No , I think I have everything . I shall be very comfortable here . You have made the room so charming , "  --  this last a final crawling sop to win her approval . She shrugged her shoulders , and still she did not smile . " I only followed out Mr. de Winter 's instructions , " she said . She hesitated by the doorway , her hand on the handle of the open door . It was as though she still had something to say to me , and could not decide upon the words , yet waited there , for me to give her opportunity . I wished she would go , she was like a shadow standing there , watching me , appraising me with her hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you find anything not to your liking you will tell me at once ? " she asked . " Yes , " I said . " Yes , of course , Mrs. Danvers , " but I knew this was not what she had meant to say , and silence fell between us once again. 74 Daphne du Maurier " If Mr. de Winter asks for his big wardrobe , " she said suddenly , " you must tell him it was impossible to move . We tried , but we could not get it through these narrow doorways . These are smaller rooms than those in the west wing . If he does n't like the arrangement of this suite he must tell me . It was difficult to know how to furnish these rooms . " " Please do n't worry , Mrs. Danvers , " I said , " I 'm sure he will be pleased with everything . But I 'm sorry it 's given you so much trouble . I had no idea he was having rooms redecorated and furnished , he should n't have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as happy and comfortable in the west wing . " She looked at me curiously , and began twisting the handle of the door . " Mr. de Winter said you would prefer to be on this side , " she said , " the rooms in the west wing are very old . The bedroom in the big suite is twice as large as this , a very beautiful room too , with a scrolled ceiling . The tapestry chairs are very valuable , and so is the carved mantelpiece . It 's the most beautiful room in the house . And the windows look down across the lawns to the sea . " I felt uncomfortable , a little shy . I did not know why she must speak with such an undercurrent of resentment , implying as she did at the same time that this room , where I found myself to be installed , was something inferior , not up to Manderley standard , a secondrateroom , as it were , for a second-rate person . " I suppose Mr. de Winter keeps the most beautiful room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She went on twisting the handle of the door , and then looked up at me again , watching my eyes , hesitating before replying , and when she spoke her voice was quieter even , and more toneless , than it had been before . " The bedrooms are never shown to the public , " she said , " only the hall and the gallery , and the rooms below . " She paused an instant , feeling me with her eyes . " They used to live in the west wing and use those rooms when Mrs. de Winter was alive . That big room , I was telling you about , that looked down to the sea , was Mrs. de Winter 's bedroom . " Then I saw a shadow flit across her face , and she drew back against the wall , effacing herself , as a step sounded outside and Maxim came into the room . " How is it ? " he said to me , " all right ? Do you think you 'll like it ? " He looked round with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this a most attractive room , " he said . " It was wastedall those years as a guest-room , but I always thought it had possibili-REBECCA 75ties . You 've made a great success of it , Mrs. Danvers , I give you full marks . " " Thank you , sir , " she said , her face expressionless , and then she turned , and went out of the room , closing the door softly behind her . Maxim went and leant out of the window . " I love the rosegarden , " he said ; " one of the first things I remember is walking after my mother , on very small , unsteady legs , while she picked off the dead heads of the roses . There 's something peaceful and happy about this room , and it 's quiet too . You could never tell you were within five minutes of the sea , from this room . " " That 's what Mrs. Danvers said , " I told him . He came away from the window , he prowled about the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wardrobes , fingeringmy clothes , already unpacked . " How did you get on with old Danvers ? " he said abruptly . I turned away , and began combing my hair again before the looking-glass . " She seems just a little bit stiff , " I said , after a moment or two , " perhaps she thought I was going to interfere with the running of the house . " " I do n't think she would mind your doing that , " he said . I looked up and saw him watching my reflection in the looking-glass , and then he turned away and went over to the window again , whistling quietly , under his breath , rocking backwards and forwards on his heels . " Do n't mind her , " he said , " she 's an extraordinary character in many ways , and possibly not very easy for another woman to get on with . You must n't worry about it . If she really makes herself a nuisance we 'll get rid of her . But she 's efficient , you know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I dare say she 's a bit of a bully to the staff . She does n't dare bully me though . I 'd have given her the sack long ago if she had tried . " " I expect we shall get on very well when she knows me better , " I said quickly , " after all , it 's natural enough that she should resent me a bit at first . " " Resent you , why resent you ? What the devil do you mean ? " he said . He turned from the window , frowning , an odd , half-angry expression on his face . I wondered why he should mind , and wished I had said something else . " I mean , it must be much easier for a housekeeper to look after a man alone , " I said . " I dare say she had got into the way of doing it , and perhaps she wqs afraid I should be very overbearing . " " Overbearing , my God . . . " he began , " if you think . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across to me , and kissed me on the top of my head . " Let 's forget about Mrs. Danvers , " he said ; " she does n't interest me very much I 'm afraid . Come along , and let me show you somethingof Manderley . " I did not see Mrs. Danvers again that evening , and we did not talk about her any more . I felt happier , when I had dismissed her from my thoughts , less of an interloper , and as we wandered about the rooms downstairs , and looked at the pictures , and Maxim put his arm round my shoulder , I began to feel more like the self I wanted to become , the self I had pictured in my dreams , who made Manderley her home . My footsteps no longer sounded foolish on the stone flags of the hall , for Maxim 's nailed shoes made far more noise than mine , and the pattering feet of the two dogs was a comfortable , pleasing note . I was glad , too , because it was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little while , and the showing of the pictures had taken time , when Maxim , looking at the clock , said it was too late to change for dinner , so that I was spared the embarrassment of Alice , the maid , asking what I should wear , and of her helping me to dress , and myself walking down that long flight of stairs to the hall , cold , with bare shoulders , in a dress that Mrs. Van Hopper had given me because it did not suit her daughter . I had dreaded the formality of dinner in that austere dining-room , and now , because of the little fact that we had not changed , it was quite all right , quite easy , just the same as when we had dined together in restaurants . I was comfortable in my stockinette dress , I laughed and talked about things we had seen in Italy and France , we even had the- snapshots on the table , and Frith and the footman were impersonal people , as the waiters had been , they did not stare @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the library after dinner , and presently the curtains were drawn , and more logs thrown on to the fire . It was cool for May ; I was thankful for the warmth that came from the steady burning logs . It was new for us to sit together like this , after dinner , for in Italy we had wandered about , walked or driven , gone into little cafes , leant over bridges . Maxim made instinctively now for the chair on the left of the open fireplace , and stretched out his hand for the papers . He settled one of the broad cushions behind his head , and lit a cigarette . " This is his routine , " I thought , " this is what he always does , this has been his custom now for years . " He did not look at me , he went on reading his paper , contented , comfortable , having assumed his way of living , the master of his house . And as I sat there , brooding , my chin in my hands , fondling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to me that I was not the first one to lounge there in possession of the chair , someone had been before me , had surely left an imprint of her person on the cushions , and on the arm where her hand had rested . Another one had poured the coffee from that same silver coffee pot , had placed the cup to her lips , had bent down to the dog , even as I was doing . Unconsciously I shivered , as though someone had opened the door behind me , and let a draught into the room . I was sitting in Rebecca 's chair , I was leaning against Rebecca 's cushion , and the dog had come to me and laid his head upon my knee because that had been his custom , and he remembered , in the past , she had given sugar to him there . I HAD NEVER REALISED , of course , that life at Manderley would be so orderly and planned . I remember now , looking back , how on that first morning Maxim was up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when I got downstairs , rather after nine o'clock , a little flurried by the booming summons of the gong , I found he had nearly finished , he was already peeling his fruit . He looked up at me and smiled . " You must n't mind , " he said , " this is something you will have to get used to . I 've no time to hang about at this hour of the day . Running a place like Manderley , you know , is a full-time job . The coffee and the hot dishes are on the side-board . We always help ourselves at breakfast . " I said something about my clock being slow , about having been too long in the bath , 178 Daphne du Maurierbut he did not listen , he was looking down at a letter , frowning at something . How impressed I was , I remember well ; impressed and a little over-awed by the magnificence of the breakfast offered to us . There was tea , in a great silver urn , and coffee too , and on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , of bacon , and another of fish . There was a little clutch of boiled eggs as well , in their own special heater , and porridge , in a silver porringer . On another side-board was a ham , and a great piece of cold bacon . There were scones too , on the table , and toast , and various pots of jam , marmalade , and honey , while dessert dishes , piled high with fruit , stood at either end . It seemed strange to me that Maxim , who in Italy and France had eaten a croissant and fruit only , and drunk a cup of coffee , should sit down to this breakfast at home , enough for a dozen people , day after day probably , year after year , seeing nothing ridiculousabout it , nothing wasteful . I noticed he had eaten a small piece of fish . I took a boiled egg . And I wondered what happened to the rest , all those scrambled eggs , that crisp bacon , the porridge , the remains of the fish . Were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know , never see , waiting behind kitchen doors for the gift of our breakfast ? Or was it all thrown away , shovelled into dustpans ? I would never know , of course , I would never dare to ask . " Thank the Lord I have n't a great crowd of relations to inflict upon you , " said Maxim , " a sister I very rarely see , and a grandmother who is nearly blind . Beatrice , by-the-way , asks herself over to lunch . I half expected she would . I suppose she wants to have a look at you . " " To-day ? " I said , my spirits sinking to zero . " Yes , according to the letter I got this morning . She wo n't stay long . You 'll like her , I think . She 's very direct , believes in speaking her mind . No humbug at all . If she does n't like you she 'll tell you so , to your face . " I found this hardly comforting , and wondered if there was not some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his chair , and lit a cigarette . " I 've a mass of things to see to this morning , do you think you can amuse yourself ? " he said . " I 'd like to have taken you round the garden , but I must see Crawley , my agent . I 've been away from things too long . He 'll be in to lunch , too , by-the-way . You do n't mind , do you , you will be all right ? " " Of course , " I said , " I shall be quite happy . " REBECCA 79Then he picked up his letters , and went out of the room , and I remember thinking this was not how I had imagined my first morning ; I had seen us walking together , arms linked , to the sea , coming back rather late and tired and happy to a cold lunch , alone , and sitting afterwards under that chestnut tree I could see from the library window . I lingered long over my first breakfast , spinning out the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ come in and look at me , from behind the Service screen , that I realised it was after ten o'clock . I sprang to my feet at once , feeling guilty , and apologised for sitting there so late , and he bowed , saying nothing , very polite , very correct , but I caught a flicker of surprise in his eyes . I wondered if I had said the wrong thing . Perhaps it did not do to apologise . Perhaps it lowered me in his estimation . I wished I knew what to say , what to do . I wondered if he suspected , as Mrs. Danvers had done , that poise , and grace , and assurance were not qualities inbred in me , but were things to be acquired , painfully perhaps , and slowly , costing me many bitter moments . As it was , leaving the room , I stumbled , not looking where I was going , catching my foot on the step by the door , and Frith came forward to help me , picking up my handkerchief , while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the screen , turned away to hide his smile . I heard the murmur of their voices as I crossed the hall , and one of them laughed , Robert , I supposed . Perhaps they were laughing about me . I went upstairs again , to the privacy of my bedroom , but when I opened the door I found the housemaids in there doing the room , one was sweeping the floor , the other dusting the dressingtable . They looked at me in surprise . I quickly went out again . It could not be right then , for me to go to my room at that hour in the morning . It was not expected of me . It broke the household routine . I crept downstairs once more , silently , thankful of my slippers that made no sound on the stone flags , and so into the library which was chilly , the windows flung wide open , the fire laid but not lit . I shut the windows , and looked round for a box of matches . I could not find one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to ring . But the library , so snug and warm last night with the burning logs , was like an ice-house now , in the early morning . There were matches upstairs in the bedroom , but I did not like to go for them because it would mean disturbing the housemaids at their work . I could not bear their moon faces staring at me again . I decided that ! jl8o Daphne du Maurierwhen Frith and Robert had left the dining-room I would fetch the matches from the side-board . I tiptoed out into the hall and listened . They were still clearing , I could hear the sound of voices , and the movement of trays . Presently all was silent , they must have gone through the Service doors into the kitchen quarters , so I went across the hall and into the dining-room once more . Yes , there was a box of matches on the side-board , as I expected . I crossed the room quickly , and picked them up , and as I did so Frith came back into the room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pocket , but I saw him glance at my hand in surprise . " Did you require anything , Madam ? " he said . " Oh , Frith , " I said awkwardly , " I could not find any matches . " He at once proffered me another box , handing me the cigarettes too , at the same time . This was another embarrassment , . for I did not smoke . " No , the fact is , " I said , " I felt rather cool in the library , I suppose the weather seems chilly to me , after being abroad , and I thought perhaps I would just put a match to the fire . " " The fire in the library is not usually lit until the afternoon , Madam , " he said . " Mrs. de Winter always used the morning-room . There is a good fire in there . Of course if you should wish to have the fire in the library as well I will give orders for it to be lit . " " Oh , no , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . I will go into the morning-room . Thank you , Frith . " " You will find writing-paper , and pens , and ink , in there , Madam , " he said . " Mrs. de Winter always did all her correspondence and telephoning in the morning-room , after breakfast . The house telephoneis also there , should you wish to speak to Mrs. Danvers . " " Thank you , Frith , " I said . I turned away into the hall again , humming a little tune to give me an air of confidence . I could not tell him that I had never seen the morning-room , that Maxim had not shown it to me the night before . I knew he was standing in the entrance to the dining-room , watching me , as I went across the hall , and that I must make some show of knowing my way . There was a door to the left of the great staircase , and I went recklessly towards it , praying in my heart that it would take me to my goal , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw that it was a garden-room , a place for odds and ends , there was a table where flowers were done , there were basket chairs stacked against the wall , and a couple of mackintoshes too , hanging on a peg . I came out , a little defiantly , glancing across the hall , andREBECCA 8isaw Frith still standing there . I had not deceived him though , not for a moment . " You go through the drawing-room to the morning-room , Madam , " he said , " through the door there , on your right , this side of the staircase . You go straight through the double drawing-room , and turn to your left . " " Thank you , Frith , " I said humbly , pretending no longer . I went through the long drawing-room , as he had directed , a lovely room this , beautifully proportioned , looking out upon the lawns down to the sea . The public would see this room , I supposed , and Frith , if he showed them round , would know the history @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the furniture . It was beautifulof course , I knew that , and those chairs and tables probably without price , but for all that I had no wish to linger there , I could not see myself sitting ever in those chairs , standing before that carved mantelpiece , throwing books down on to the tables . It had all the formality of a room in a museum , where alcoves were roped off , and a guardian , in cloak and hat like the guides in the French chateaux , sat in a chair beside the door . I went through then , and turned to the left , and so on to the little morning-room I had not seen before . I was glad to see the dogs there , sitting before the fire , and Jasper , the younger , came over to me at once , his tail wagging , and thrust his nose into my hand . The old one lifted her muzzle at my approach , and gazed in my direction with her blind eyes , but when she had sniffed the air @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she sought , she turned her head away with a grunt , and looked steadily into the fire again . Then Jasper left me , too , and settled himself by the side of his companion , licking his side . This was their routine . They knew , even as Frith had known , that the library fire was not lit until the afternoon . They came to the morning-room from long custom . Somehow I guessed , before going to the window , that the room looked out upon the rhododendrons . Yes , there they were , blood-red and luscious , as I had seen them the evening before , great bushes of them , massed beneath the open window , encroaching on to the sweep of the drive itself . There was a little clearing too , between the bushes , like a miniature lawn , the grass a smooth carpet of moss , and in the centre of this , the tiny statue of a naked faun , his pipes to his lips . The crimson rhododendrons made his background , and the clearingitself was like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play82 Daphne du Maurierhis part . There was no musty smell about this room , as there had been in the library . There were no old well-worn chairs , no tables littered with magazines and papers , seldom if ever read , but left there from long custom , because Maxim 's father , or even his grandfatherperhaps , had wished it so . This was a woman 's room , graceful , fragile , the room of someone who had chosen every particle of furniture with great care , so that each chair , each vase , each small , infinitesimal thing should be in harmony with one another , and with her own personality . It was as though she who had arranged this room had said : " This I will have , and this , and this , " taking piece by piece from the treasures in Manderley each object that pleased her best , ignoring the secondrate , the mediocre , laying her hand with sure and certain instinct only upon the best . There was no intermingling of style , no confusingof period , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , not coldly formal like the drawing-room shown to the public , but vividly alive , having something of the same glow and brilliance that the rhododendrons had , massed there , beneath the window . And I noticed then that the rhododendrons , not content with forming their theatre on the little lawn outside the window , had been permitted to the room itself . Their great warm faces looked down upon me from the mantelpiece , they floated in a bowl upon the table by the sofa , they stood , lean and graceful , on the writing-desk beside the golden candlesticks . The room was filled with them , even the walls took colour from them , becoming rich and glowing in the morning sun . They were the only flowers in the room , and I wondered if there was some purpose in it , whether the room had been arranged originally with this one end in view , for nowhere else in the house did the rhododendronsobtrude . There were flowers in the dining-room , flowers in the library , but orderly and trim , rather @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ profusion . I went and sat down at the writing-desk , and I thought how strange it was that this room , so lovely and so rich in colour , should be , at the ' same time , so business-like and purposeful . Somehow I should have expected that a room furnished as this was in such exquisite taste , for all the exaggeration of the flowers , would be a place of decoration only , languorous and intimate . But this writing-table , beautiful as it was , was no pretty toy where a woman would scribble little notes , nibbling the end of a pen , leaving it , day after day , in carelessness , the blotter a little askew . The pigeon-holes were docketed , " letters-unanswered , " " letters-to-keep , " REBECCA 83 " household , " " estate , " " menus , " " miscellaneous , " " addresses " ; each ticket written in that same scrawling pointed hand that I knew already . And it shocked me , even startled me , to recognise it again , for I had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the book of poems , and I had not thought to see it again . I opened a drawer at hazard , and there was the writing once it more , this time in an open leather book , whose heading " Guests at Manderley " showed at once , divided into weeks and months , what visitors had come and gone , the rooms they had used , the food they had eaten . I turned over the pages , and saw that the book was a complete record of a year , so that the hostess , glancing back , would know to the day , almost to the hour , what guest had passed what night under her roof , and where he had slept , and what she had given him to eat . There was note-paper also in the drawer , thick white sheets , for rough writing , and the note-paper of the house , with the crest , and the address , and visiting cards , ivory-white , in little boxes . I took one out and looked at it , unwrapped it from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Winter " it said , and in the corner " Manderley . " I put it back in the box again , and shut the drawer , feeling guilty suddenly , and deceitful , as though I were staying in somebody else 's house and my hostess had said to me , " Yes , of course , write letters at my desk , " and I had unforgivably , in a stealthy manner , peeped at her correspondence . At any moment she might come back into the room , and she would see me there , sitting before her open drawer , which I had no right to touch . And when the telephone rang , suddenly , alarmingly , on the desk in front of me , my heart leapt and I stared up in terror , thinking I had been discovered . I took the ' receiver off with trembling hands , and ' Who is it ? " I said , " who do you want ? " There was a strange buzzing at the end of the line , and then a voice came , low @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man I could not tell , and " Mrs. de Winter ? " it said , " Mrs. de Winter ? " " I 'm afraid you have made a mistake , " I said , " Mrs. de Winter has been dead for over a year . " I sat there , waiting , staring stupidly into the mouthpiece , and it was not until the name was repeated again , the voice incredulous , slightly raised , that I became aware , with a rush of colour to my face , that I had blundered irretrievably , and could not take back my words . " It 's Mrs. Danvers , Madam , " said the voice , " I 'm speaking to you on the house telephone . " My faux-pas was so palpably obvious , so idiotic and unpardonable , that84 Daphne du Maurierto ignore it would show me to be an even greater fool if possible , than I was already . " I 'm sorry , Mrs. Danvers , " I said stammering , my words tumbling over one another , " the telephone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saying , I did n't realise the call was for me , and I never noticed I was speaking on the house telephone . " " I 'm sorry to have disturbed you , Madam , " she said , and she knows , I thought , she guesses I have been looking through the desk , " I only wondered whether you wished to see me , and whether you approved of the menus for to-day . " " Oh , " I said . " Oh , I 'm sure I do , that is , I 'm sure I approve of the menus , just order what you like , Mrs. Danvers , you need n't bother to ask me . " " It would be better I think if you read the list , " continued the voice , " you will find the menu of the day on the blotter , beside you . " I searched feverishly about me on the desk , and found at last a sheet of paper I had not noticed before . I glanced hurriedly through it , curried prawns @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was this lunch or dinner , I could not see , lunch I suppose . " Yes , Mrs. Danvers , " I said , " very suitable , very nice indeed . " " If you wish anything changed please say so , " she answered , " and I will give orders at once . You will notice I have left a blank space beside the sauce , for you to mark your preference . I was not sure what sauce you are used to having served with the roast veal . Mrs. de Winter was most particular about her sauces , and I always had to refer to her . " " Oh , " I said . " Oh , well . . . let me see , Mrs. Danvers , I hardly know ; I think we had better have what you usually have , whatever you think Mrs. de Winter would have ordered . " " You have no preference , Madam ? " " No , " I said . " No , really , Mrs. Danvers . " " I rather think Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " We will have the same then , of course , " I said . " I 'm very sorry I disturbed you while you were-writing , Madam . " " You did n't disturb me at all , " I said , " please do n't apologise . " " The post leaves at midday , and Robert will come for your letters , and stamp them himself , " she said ; " all you have to do is to ringthrough to him , on the telephone , if you have anything urgentREBECCA 85to be sent , and he will give orders for them to be taken in to the post-office immediately . " " Thank you , Mrs. Danvers , " I said . I listened for a moment , but she said no more , and then I heard a little click at the end of the telephone , which meant she had replaced the receiver . I did the same . Then I looked down again at the desk , and the note-paper , ready for use , upon the blotter . In front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon them " letters-unanswered , " " estate , " ; " miscellaneous , " were like a reproach to me for my idleness . She who sat here before me had not wasted her time , as I was doing . She had reached out for the house telephone and given her orders for the day , swiftly , efficiently , and run her pencil through an item in the menu that had not pleased her . She had not said " Yes , Mrs. Danvers , " and " Of course , Mrs. Danvers , " as I had done . And then , when she had finished , she began her letters , five , six , seven perhaps to be answered , all written in that same curious , slanting hand I knew so well . She would tear off sheet after sheet . of that smooth white paper , using it extravagantly , because of the long strokes she made when she wrote , and at the end of her personal letters she put her signature , " Rebecca , " that tall sloping R dwarfing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk . The pigeon-holes were empty now . There were no " letters-unanswered " waiting to be dealt with , no bills to pay that I knew anything about . If I had anything urgent , Mrs. Danvers said , I must telephone through to Robert and he would give orders for it to be taken to the post . I wondered how many urgent letters Rebecca used to write , and who they were written to . Dressmakers perhaps  --  " I must have the white satin on Tuesday , without fail , " or to her hair-dresser  --  " I shall be coming up next Friday , and want an appointment at three o'clock with MonsieurAntoine himself . Shampoo , massage , set , and manicure . " No letters of that type would be a waste of time . She would have a call put through to London , Frith would do it . Frith would say " I am speaking for Mrs. de Winter . " I went on drumming with my fingers on the desk . I could think of nobody to write to . Only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather ironical , in the realisation that here I was sitting at my own desk in my own home with nothing better to do than to write a letter to Mrs. Van Hopper , a woman I disliked , whom I should never see again . I pulled a sheet of note-paper towards me . I took up the narrow , slender pen , with the bright pointed nib . " Dear Mrs. Van Hopper , " I began . And as I wrote , in halting , laboured fashion , saying I hoped the voyage had86 Daphne du Maurierbeen good , that she had found her daughter better , that the weather in New York was fine and warm , I noticed for the first time how cramped and unformed was my own hand-writing , without individuality , without style , uneducated even , the writing of an indifferentpupil taught in a second-rate school. 9WHEN I HEARD the sound of the car in the drive I got up in sudden panic , glancing at the clock , for I knew that it meant Beatrice and her husband had arrived . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earlier than I expected . And Maxim was not yet back . I wondered if it would be possible to hide , to get out of the window into the garden , so that Frith , bringing them to the morning-room , would say " Madam must have gone out , " and it would seem quite natural , they would take it as a matter of course . The dogs looked up enquiringly as I ran to the window , and Jasper followed me , wagging his tail . The window opened out on to the terrace and the little grass clearing beyond , but as I prepared to brush past the rhododendrons the sound of voices came close , and I backed again into the room . They were coming to the house by way of the garden , Frith having told them doubtless that I was in the morning-room . I went quickly into the big drawing-room , and made for a door near me on the left . It led into a long stone passage , and I ran along it , fully aware of my stupidity , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew I could not face these people , not for a moment anyway . The passage seemed to be taking me to the back regions , and as I turned a corner , coming upon another staircase , I met a servant I had not seen before , a scullery-maid perhaps , she carried a mop and a pail in her hands . She stared at me in wonder , as though I were a vision , unexpected in this part of the house , and " Good-morning , " I said , in great confusion , making for the stairway , and " Goodmorning , Madam , " she returned , her mouth open , her round eyes inquisitive as I climbed the stairs . They would lead me , I supposed , to the bedrooms , and I couldREBECCA 87find my suite in the east wing , and sit up there a little while , until I judged it nearly time for lunch , when good manners would compelme to come down again . I must have lost my bearings , for passing through a door at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I had not seen before , similar in some ways to the one in the east wing , but broader and darker  --  dark owing to the panelling of the walls . I hesitated , then turned left , coming upon a broad landing and another staircase . It was very quiet and dark . No one was about . If therd had been housemaids here , during the morning , they had finished their work by now and gone downstairs . There was no trace of their presence , no lingering dust smell of carpets lately swept , and I thought , as I stood there , wondering which way to turn , that the silence was unusual , holding something of the same oppression as an empty house does , when the owners have gone away . I opened a door at hazard , and found a room in total darkness , no chink of light coming through the closed shutters , while I could see dimly , in the centre of the room , the outline of furniture swathed in white dust-sheets . The room smelt close @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ever used , whose ornaments are herded together in the centre of a bed and left there , covered with a sheet . It might be too that the curtains had not been drawn from the window since some preceding summer , and if one crossed there now and pulled them aside , opening the creaking shutters , a dead moth who had been imprisoned behind them for many months would fall to the carpet and lie there , beside a forgotten pin , and dried leaf blown there before the windows were closed for the last time . I shut the door softly , and went uncertainly along the corridor , flanked on either side by doors , all of them closed , until I came to a little alcove , set in an outside wall , where a broad window gave me light at last . I looked out , and I saw below me the smooth grass lawns stretching to the sea , and the sea itself , bright green with whitetoppedcrests , whipped by a westerly wind and scudding from the shore . It was closer than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , beneaththat little knot of trees below the lawns , barely five minutes away , and if I listened now , my ear to the window , I could hear the surf breaking on the shores of some little bay I could not see . I knew then I had made the circuit of the house , and was standing in the corridor of the west wing . Yes , Mrs. Danvers was right . You could hear the sea from here . You might imagine , in the winter , it88 Daphne du Maurierwould creep up on to those green lawns and threaten the house itself , for even now , because of the high wind , there was a mist upon the window-glass , as though someone had breathed upon it . A mist salt-laden , borne upwards from the sea . A hurrying cloud hid the sun for a moment as I watched , and the sea changed colour instantly , becoming black , and the white crests with them very pitiless suddenly , and cruel , not the gay sparkling sea I had looked on first . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wing . I preferred the rose-garden , after all , to the sound of the sea . I went back to the landing then , at the head of the stairs , and as I prepared to go down , one hand upon the banister , I heard the door behind me open , and it was Mrs. Danvers . We stared at one another for a moment without speaking , and I could not be certain whether it was anger I read in her eyes or curiosity , for her face became a mask directly she saw me . Although she said nothing I felt guilty and ashamed , as though I had been caught trespassing , and I felt the tell-tale colour come up into my face . " I lost my way , " I said , " I was trying to find my room . " " You have come to the opposite side of the house , " she said , " this is the west wing . " " Yes , I know , " I said . " Did you go into any of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I said . " No , I just opened a door , I did not go in . Everythingwas dark , covered up in dust-sheets . I 'm sorry . I did not mean to disturb anything . I expect you like to keep all this shut up . " " If you wish to open up the rooms I will have it done , " she said ,  --  you have only to tell me . The rooms are all furnished , and can be used .  --  " Oh , no , " I said . " No , I did not mean you to think that . " " Perhaps you would like me to show you all over the west wing ? " she said . I shook my head . " No , rather not , " I said . " No , I must go downstairs . " I began to walk down the stairs , and she came with me , by my side , as though she were a warder , and I in custody . " Any time , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ask me , and I will show you the rooms in the west wing , " she persisted , making me vaguely uncomfortable , I knew not why . Her insistence struck a chord in my memory , reminding me of a visit to a friend 's house , as a child , when the daughter of the house , older than I , took my arm and whispered in my ear , " I know where there is a book , locked in a cupboard , in my mother 's bedroom . Shall we go andREBECCA 89look at it ? " I remembered her white , excited face , and her small , beady eyes , and the way she kept pinching my arm . " I will have the dust-sheets removed , and then . you can see the rooms as they looked when they were used , " said Mrs. Danvers . " I would have shown you this morning , but I believed you to be writing letters in the morning-room . You have only to telephone through to my room , you know , when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have the rooms in readiness . " We had come down the short flight of stairs , and she opened another door , standing aside for me to pass through , her dark eyes questing my face . " It 's very kind of you , Mrs. Danvers , " I said . " I will let you know some time . " We passed out together on to the landing beyond , and I saw we were at the head of the main staircase now , behind the minstrels ' gallery . " I wonder how you came to miss your way ? " she said , " the door through to the west wing is very different to this . " " I did not come this way , " I said . " Then you must have come up the back way , from the stone passage ? " she said . " Yes , " I said , not meeting her eyes . " Yes , I came through a stone passage . " She went on looking at me , as though she expected me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ panic , going through the back regions , and I felt suddenly that she knew , that she must have watched me , that she had seen me wandering perhaps in that west wing from the first , her eye to a crack in the door . " Mrs. Lacy , and Major Lacy , have been here some time , " she said . " I heard their car drive up shortly after twelve . " " Oh ! " I said . " I had not realised that . " " Frith will have taken them to the morning-room , " she said , " it must be getting on for half-past twelve . You know your way now , do n't you ? " " Yes , Mrs. Danvers , " I said . And I went down the big stairway into the hall , knowing she was standing there above me , her eyes watching me . I knew I must go back now , to the morning-room , and meet Maxim 's sister and her husband . I could not hide in my bedroom now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over my90 Daphne du Mauriershoulder , and I saw Mrs. Danvers still standing there at the head of the stairs , like a black sentinel . I stood for a moment outside the morning-room , with my hand on the door , listening to the hum of voices . Maxim had returned then , while I had been upstairs , bringing his agent with him I supposed , for it sounded to me as if the room was full of people . I was aware of the same feeling of sick uncertainty I had experienced so often as a child , when summoned to shake hands with visitors , and turning the handle of the door I blundered in , to be met at once , it seemed , with a sea of faces and a general silence . " Here she is at last , " said Maxim . " Where have you been hiding ? We were thinking of sending out a search party . Here is Beatrice , and this is Giles , and this is Frank Crawley . Look out , you nearly trod on the dog @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ handsome , very much like Maxim about the eyes and jaw , but not as smart as I had expected , much tweedier ; the sort of person who would nurse dogs through distemper , know about horses , shoot well . She did not kiss me . She shook hands very firmly , looking me straight in the eyes , and then she turned to Maxim , " Quite different from what I expected . Does n't answer to your description at all . " Everyone laughed , and I joined in , not quite certain if the laugh was against me or not , wondering secretly what it was she had expected , and what had been Maxim 's description . And " This is Giles , " said Maxim , prodding my arm , and Giles stretched out an enormous paw and wrung my hand , squeezing the fingers limp , genial eyes smiling from behind horn-rimmed glasses . " Frank Crawley , " said Maxim , and I turned to the agent , a colourless , rather thin man with a prominent Adam 's apple , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered why , but I had no time to think of that , because Frith had come in , and was offering me sherry , and Beatrice was talking to me again . " Maxim tells me you only got back last night . I had not realised that , or of course we would never have thrust ourselves upon you so soon . Well , what do you think of Manderley ? " " I 've scarcely seen anything of it yet , " I answered , " it 's beautiful , of course . " She was looking me up and down , as I had expected , but in a direct , straightforward fashion , not maliciously like Mrs. Danvers , not with unfriendliness . She had a right to judge me , she wasREBECCA 91Maxim 's sister , and Maxim himself came to my side now , putting his arm through mine , giving me confidence . " You 're looking better , old man , " she said to him , her head on one side , considering him , " you 've lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've got you to thank for that ? " nodding at me . " I 'm always very fit , " said Maxim shortly , " never had anything wrong with me in my life . You imagine everyone ill who does n't look as fat as Giles . " " Bosh , " said Beatrice , " you know perfectly well you were a perfect wreck six months ago . Gave me the fright of my life when I came and saw you . I thought you were in for a breakdown . Giles , bear me out . Did n't Maxim look perfectly ghastly last time we came over , and did n't I say he was heading for a breakdown ? " " Well , I must say , old chap , you 're looking a different person , " said Giles . " Very good thing you went away . Does n't he look well , Crawley ? " I could tell by the tightening of Maxim 's muscles under my arm that he was trying to keep his temper . For some reason this talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even , and I thought it tactless of Beatrice to harp upon it in this way , making so big a point of it . " Maxim 's very sunburnt , " I said shyly , " it hides a multitude of sins . You should have seen him in Venice , having breakfast on the balcony , trying to get brown on purpose . He thinks it makes him better-looking . " Everyone laughed , and Mr. Crawley said , " It must have been wonderful in Venice , Mrs. de Winter , this time of the year , " and " Yes , " I said , " we had really wonderful weather . Only one bad day , was n't it , Maxim ? " the conversation drawing away happily from his health , and so to Italy , safest of subjects , and the blessed topic of fine weather . Conversation was easy now , no longer an effort , Maxim and Giles and Beatrice were discussing the running of Maxim 's car , and Mr. Crawley was asking if it was true there were no more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't think he would have cared at all had there been steamers at anchor in the Grand Canal , he was saying this to help me , it was his contribution to the little effort of steering the talk away from Maxim 's health , and I was grateful to him , feeling him an ally , for all his dull appearance . " Jasper wants exercise , " said Beatrice , stirring the dog with her92 Daphne du Maurier foot ; " he 's getting much too fat , and he 's barely two years old . What do you feed him on , Maxim ? " " My dear Beatrice , he has exactly the same routine as your dogs , " said Maxim . " Do n't show off and make out you know more about animals than I do . " " Dear old boy , how can you pretend to know what Jasper has been fed on when you 've been away for a couple of months ? Do n't tell me Frith walks to the lodge gates with him twice a day . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ can tell by the condition of his coat . " " I 'd rather he looked colossal than half-starved like that half-wit dog of yours , " said Maxim , " Not a very intelligent remark when Lion won two firsts at Crufts ' last February , " said Beatrice . The atmosphere was becoming rather strained again , I could tell by the narrow line of Maxim 's mouth , and I wondered if brothers and sisters always sparred like this , making it uncomfortable for those who listened . I wished that Frith would come in and announce lunch . Or would we be summoned by a booming gong ? I did not know what happened at Manderley . " How far away from us are you ? " I asked , sitting down by Beatrice , " did you have to make a very early start ? " " We 're fifty miles away , my dear , in the next county , the other side of Trowchester . The hunting is so much better with us . You must come over and stay , when Maxim can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm afraid I do n't hunt , " I confessed , " I learnt to ride , as a child , but very feebly , I do n't remember much about it . " " You must take it up again , " she said , " you ca n't possibly live in the country and not ride . You would n't know what to do with yourself . Maxim says you paint . That 's very nice , of course , but there 's no exercise in it , is there ? All very well on a wet day when there 's nothing better to do . " " My dear Beatrice , we are not all such fresh-air fiends as you , " said Maxim . " I was n't talking to you , old boy . We all know you are perfectly happy slopping about the Manderley gardens and never breaking out of a slow walk . " " I 'm very fond of walking too , " I said swiftly , " I 'm sure I shall never get tired of rambling about Manderley . And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' " My dear , you are an optimist , " said Beatrice , " I can hardly eve remember bathing here . The water is far too cold , and the beach is shingle . " " I do n't mind that , " I said . " I love bathing . As long as the currents are not too strong . Is the bathing safe in the bay ? " Nobody answered , and I realised suddenly what I had said . My heart thumped , and I felt my cheeks go flaming red . I bent down to stroke Jasper 's ear , in an agony of confusion . " Jasper could dc with a swim , and get some of that fat off , " said Beatrice , breaking the pause , " but he 'd find it a bit too much for him in the bay , would n't you , Jasper ? Good old Jasper . Nice old man . " We patted the dog together , not looking at one another . " I say , I 'm getting infernally hungry , what on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's only just on one now , " said Mr. Crawley , " according to the clock on the mantelpiece . " " That clock was always fast , " said Beatrice . " It 's kept perfect time now for months , " said Maxim . At that moment the door opened and Frith announced that luncheon was served . " I say , I must have a wash , " said Giles , looking at his hands . We all got up and wandered through the drawing-room to the hall in great relief , Beatrice and I a little ahead of the men , she taking my arm . " Dear old Frith , " she said , " he always looks exactly the same , and makes me feel like a girl again . You know , do n't mind me saying so , but you are even younger than I expected . Maxim told me your age , but you 're an absolute child . Tell me , are you very much in love with him ? " I was not prepared for this question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ face for she laughed lightly , and squeezed my arm . " Do n't answer , " she said , " I can see what you feel . I 'm an interferingbore , are n't I ? You must n't mind me . I 'm devoted to Maxim , you know , though we always bicker like cat and dog when we meet . I congratulate you again on his looks . We were all very worried about him this time last year , but of course you know the whole story . " We had come to the dining-room by now , and she said no more , for the servants were there and the others had joined us , but as I sat down , and unfolded my napkin , I wondered what Beatrice would say did she realise that I knew nothing of that preceding vear no details of the traoerly that hart hannened rlo , m there in tli Daphne du Maurierbay , that Maxim kept these things to himself , that I questioned him never . Lunch passed off better than I had dared to hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exercising tact at last , at any rate she and Maxim chatted about matters concerning Manderley , her horses , the garden , mutual friends , and Frank Crawley , on my left , kept up an easy patter with me for which I was grateful , as it required no effort . Giles was more concerned with food than with the conversation , though now and again he remembered my existence and flung me a remark at hazard . " Same cook I suppose , Maxim ? " he said , when Robert had offered him the cold souffle for the second time . " I always tell Bee , Manderley'sthe only place left in England where one can get decent cooking . I remember this souffle of old . " " I think we change cooks periodically , " said Maxim , " but the standard of cooking remains the same . Mrs. Danvers has all the recipes , she tells them what to do . " " Amazing woman , that Mrs. Danvers , " said Giles , turning to me , " do n't you think so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mrs. Danvers seems to be a wonderful person . " " She 's no oil painting though , is she ? " said Giles , and he roared with laughter . Frank Crawley said nothing , and looking up I saw Beatrice was watching me . She turned away then , and began talking to Maxim . " Do you play golf at all , Mrs. de Winter ? " said Mr. Crawley . " No , I 'm afraid I do n't , " I answered , glad that the subject had been changed again , that Mrs. Danvers was forgotten , and even though I was no player , knew nothing of the game , I was prepared to listen to him as long as he pleased ; there was something solid and safe and dull about golf , it could not bring us into any difficulties . We had cheese , and coffee , and I wondered whether I was supposed to make a move . I kept looking at Maxim , but he gave no sign , and then Giles embarked upon a story , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a snow-drift  --  what had started the train of thought I could not tell  --  and I listened to him politely , nodding my head now and again and smiling , aware of Maxim becoming restive at his end of the table . At last he paused , and I caught Maxim 's eye . He frowned very slightly , and jerked his head towards the door . I got up at once , shaking the table clumsily as I moved my chair , and upsetting Giles 's glass of port . " Oh , dear , " I said , hovering , REBECCA 95wondering what to do , reaching ineffectively for my napkin , but " All right , Frith will deal with it , " said Maxim , " do n't add to the confusion . Beatrice , take her out in the garden , she 's scarcely seen the place yet . " He looked tired , rather jaded . I began to wish none of them had come . They had spoilt our day anyway . It was too much of an effort , just as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ depressed . Maxim had seemed almost irritable when he suggested we should go into the garden . What a fool I had been , upsetting that glass of port : We went out on to the terrace and walked down on to the smooth green lawns . " I think it 's a pity you came back to Manderley so soon , " said Beatrice , " it would have been far better to potter about in Italy for three or four months , and then come back in the middle of the summer . Done Maxim a power of good too , besides being easier from your point of view . I ca n't help feeling it 's all going to be rather a strain here for you at first . " " Oh , I do n't think so , " I said . " I know I shall come to love Manderley . " She did not answer , and we strolled backwards and forwards on the lawns . " Tell me a bit about yourself , " she said at last , " what was it you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some appalling American woman , Maxim said . " I explained about Mrs. Van Hopper , and what had led to it , and she seemed sympathetic but a little vague , as though she was thinking of something else . " Yes , " she said , when I paused , " it all happened very suddenly , as you say . But of course we were all delighted , my dear , and I do hope you will be happy . " " Thank you , Beatrice , " I said , " thank you very much . " I wondered why she said she hoped we would be happy , instead of saying she knew we would be so . She was kind , she was sincere , I liked her very much , but there was a tiny doubt in her voice that made me afraid . " When Maxim wrote and told me , " she went on , taking my arm , " and said he had discovered you in the south of France , and you were very young , very pretty , I must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Of course we all expected a social butterfly , very modern and plastered with paint , the sort of girl you expect to meet in those sort96 Daphne du Maurierof places . When you came into the morning-room before lunch you could have knocked me down with a feather . " She laughed , and I laughed with her . But she did not say whether or not she was disappointed in my appearance or relieved . " Poor Maxim , " she said , " he went through a ghastly time , and let 's hope you have made him forget about it . Of course he adores Manderley . " Part of me wanted her to continue her train of thought , to tell me more of the past , naturally , and easily like this , and something else , way back in my mind , did not want to know , did not want to hear . " We are not a bit alike , you know , " she said , " our characters are poles apart . I show everything on my face , whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or pleased . There 's no reserve about me . Maxim is entirely different . Very quiet , very reserved . You never know what 's going on in that funny mind of his . I lose my temper on the slightest provocation , flare up , and then it 's all over . Maxim loses his temper once or twice in a year , and when he does  --  my God  --  he does lose it . I do n't suppose he ever will with you . I should think you are a placid little thing . " She smiled , and pinched my arm , and I thought about being placid , how quiet and comfortable it sounded , someone with knittingon her lap , with calm unruffled brow . Someone who was never anxious , never tortured by doubt and indecision , someone who never stood as I did , hopeful , eager , frightened , tearing at bitten nails , uncertain which way to go , what star to follow . " You wo n't mind me saying so , will you ? " she went on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to your hair . Why do n't you have it waved ? It 's so very lanky , is n't it , like that ? Must look awful under a hat . Why do n't you sweep it back behind your ears ? " I did so obediently , and waited for her approval . She looked at me critically , her head on one side . " No , " she said . " No , I think that 's worse . It 's too severe , and does n't suit you . No , all you need is a wave , just to pinch it up . I never have cared for that Joan of Arc business or whatever they call it . What does Maxim say ? Does he think it suits you ? " " I do n't know , " I said , " he 's never mentioned it . " " Oh , well , " she said , " perhaps he likes it . Do n't go by me . Tell me , did you get any clothes in London or Paris ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no time . Maxim was anxious to get home . And I can always send for catalogues . " REBECCA 97 " I can tell by the way you dress that you do n't care a hoot what you wear , " she said . I glanced at my flannel skirt apologetically . " I do , " I said . " I 'm very fond of nice things . I 've never had much money to spend on clothes up to now . " " I wonder Maxim did not stay a week or so in London and get you something decent to wear , " she said . " I must say , I think it 's rather selfish of him . So unlike him too . He 's generally so particular . " " Is he ? " I said ; " he 's never seemed particular to me . I do n't think he notices what I wear at all . I do n't think he minds . " " Oh ' , " she said . " Oh , well , he must have changed then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Jasper , her hands inher pockets , and then stared up at the house above us . " You 're not using the west wing then , " she said . " No , " I said . " No , we have the suite in the east wing . It 's all been done up . " " Has it ? " she said , " I did n't know that . I wonder why . " " It was Maxim 's idea , " I said , " he seems to prefer it . " She said nothing , she went on looking at the windows , and whistling . " How do you get on with Mrs. Danvers ? " she said suddenly . I bent down , and began patting Jasper 's head , and stroking his ears . " I have not seen very much of her , " I said , " she scares me a little . I 've never seen anyone quite like her before . " " I do n't suppose you have , " said Beatrice . Jasper looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I kissed the top of his silken head , and put my hand over his black nose . " There 's no need to be frightened of her , " said Beatrice , " and do n't let her see it , whatever you do . Of course I 've never had anything to do with her , and I do n't think I ever want to either . However , she 's always been very civil to me . " I went on patting Jasper 's head . " Did she seem friendly ? " said Beatrice . " No , " I said . " No , not very . " Beatrice began whistling again , and she rubbed Jasper 's head with her foot . " I should n't have more to do with her than you can help , " she said . " No , " I said . " She runs the house very efficiently , there 's no need for me to interfere . " " Oh , I do n't suppose she 'd mind that , " said Beatrice . That was what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought it odd98 Daphne du Maurierthat they should both have the same opinion . I should have imaginedthat interference was the one thing Mrs. Danvers did not want . " I dare say she will get over it in time , " said Beatrice , " but it may make things rather unpleasant for you at first . Of course she 's insanely jealous . I was afraid she would be . " " Why ? " I asked , looking up at her , " why should she be jealous ? Maxim does not seem to be particularly fond of her . " " My dear child , it 's not Maxim she 's thinking of , " said Beatrice , " I think she respects him and all that , but nothing more very much . No , you see "  --  she paused , frowning a little , looking at me uncertainly  --  " sheresents your being here at all , that 's the trouble . " " Why ? " I said , " why should she resent me ? " " I thought you knew , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ told you . She simply adored Rebecca . " " Oh , " I said . " Oh , I see . " We both went on patting and stroking Jasper , who , unaccustomed to such attention , rolled over on his back in ecstasy . " Here are the men , " said Beatrice , " let 's have some chairs out and sit under the chestnut . How fat Giles is getting , he looks quite repulsive beside Maxim . I suppose Frank will go back to the office . What a dull creature he is , never has anything interesting to say . Well , all of you . What have you been discussing ? Pulling the world to bits I suppose . " She laughed , and the others strolled towards us , and we all stood about . Giles threw a twig for Jasper to retrieve . We all looked at Jasper . Mr. Crawley looked at his watch . " I must be off , " he said , " thank you very much for lunch , Mrs. de Winter . " " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I wondered if the others would go too . I was not sure whether they had just come over for lunch , or to spend the day . I hoped they would go . I wanted to be alone with Maxim again , and that it would be like when we were in Italy . We all went and sat down under the chestnut tree . Robert brought out chairs and rugs . Giles lay down on his back and tipped his hat over his eyes . After a while he began to snore , his mouth open . " Shut up , Giles , " said Beatrice . " I 'm not asleep , " he muttered , opening his eyes , and shutting them again . I thought him unattractive . I wondered why Beatrice had married him . She could never have been in love with him . Perhaps that was what she was thinking about me . I caught her eye upon me now and again , puzzled , reflective , as though she was saying to herself " What onREBECCA 99earth does Maxim see in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not unfriendly . They were talking about their grandmother . " We must go over and see the old lady , " Maxim was saying , and " She 's getting gaga , " said Beatrice , " drops food all down her chin , poor darling . " I listened to them both , leaning against Maxim 's arm , rubbing my chin on his sleeve . He stroked my hand absently , not thinking , talking to Beatrice . " That 's what I do to Jasper , " I thought . " I 'm being like Jasper now , leaning against him . He pats me now and again , when he remembers , and I 'm pleased , I get closer to him for a moment . He likes me in the way I like , Jasper . " The wind had dropped . The afternoon was drowsy , peaceful . The grass had been new-mown , it smelt sweet and rich , like summer . A bee droned above Giles 's head , and he flicked at it with his hat . Jasper sloped in to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tongue lolling from his mouth . He flopped beside me , and began licking his side , his large eyes apologetic . The sun shone on the mullioned windows of the house , and I could see the green lawns and the terrace reflected in them . Smoke curled thinly from one of the near chimneys , and I wondered if the library fire had been lit , according to routine . A thrush flew across the lawn to the magnolia tree outside the dining-room window . I could smell the faint , soft magnolia s ent as I sat here , on the lawn . Everything was quiet and still . Very distant now came the washing of the sea in the bay below . The tide must have gone out . The bee droned over us again , pausing to taste the chestnut blossom above our heads . " This is what I always imagined , " I thought , " this is how I hoped it ' would be , living at Manderley . " I wanted to go on sitting here , not talking , not listening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , because we were peaceful all of us , we were content and drowsy even as the bee who droned above our heads . In a little while it would be different , there would come to-morrow , and the next day , and another year . And we would be changed perhaps , never sitting quite like this again . Some of us would go away , or suffer , or die , the future stretched away in front of us , unknown , unseen , not perhaps what we wanted , not what we planned . This moment was safe though , this could not be touched . Here we sat together , Maxim and I , hand-in-hand , and the past and the future mattered not at all . This was secure , thiszoo Daphne du Maurierfunny fragment of time he would never remember , never think about again . He would not hold it sacred , he was talking about cutting away some of the undergrowth in the drive , and Beatrice agreed , interrupting with some suggestion of her own , and throwing a piece @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them it was just after lunch , quarter-past-three on a haphazard afternoon , like any hour , like any day . They did not want to hold it close , imprisoned and secure , as I did . They were not afraid . " Well , I suppose we ought to be off , " said Beatrice , brushing the grass from her skirt , " I do n't want to be late , we 've got the Cartrights dining . " " How is old Vera ? " asked Maxim . " Oh , same as ever , always talking about her health . He 's getting very old . They 're sure to ask all about you both . " " Give them my love , " said Maxim . We got up . Giles shook the dust off his hat . Maxim yawned and stretched . The sun went in . I looked up at the sky . It had changed already , a mackerel sky . Little clouds scurrying in formation , line upon line . " Wind 's backing , " said Maxim . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Giles . " I 'm afraid we 've had the best of the day , " said Beatrice . We wandered slowly towards the drive and the waiting car . " You have n't seen what 's been done to the east wing , " said Maxim . " Come upstairs , " I suggested , " it wo n't take a minute . " We went into the hall , and up the big staircase , the men following behind . It seemed strange that Beatrice had lived here for so many years . She had run down these same stairs as a little girl , with her nurse . She had been born here , bred here , she knew it all , she belonged here more than I should ever do . She must have many memories locked inside her heart . I wondered if she ever thought about the days that were gone , ever remembered the lanky pig-tailed child that she had been once , so different from the woman she had become , forty-five now , vigorous and settled in her ways , another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , stooping under the low doorway , said , " How very jolly , this is a great improvement , is n't it , Bee ? " and " I say , old boy , you have spread yourself , " said Beatrice , " new curtains , new beds , new everything . You remember , Giles , we had this room that time you were laid up with your leg ? It was very dingy then . Of course Mother never had much idea of comfort . REBECCA IOIAnd then , you never put people here , did you , Maxim ? Except when there was an overflow . The bachelors were always dumped here . Well , it 's charming , I must say . Looks over the rose-garden too , which was always an advantage . May I powder my nose ? " The men went downstairs , and Beatrice peered in the mirror . " Did old Danvers do all this for you ? " she said . " Yes , " I said . " I think she 's done it very well . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Beatrice . " I wonder what on earth it cost . A pretty packet , I bet . Did you ask ? " " No , I 'm afraid I did not , " I said . " I do n't suppose it worried Mrs. Danvers , " said Beatrice ; " do you mind if I use your comb ? These are nice brushes . Wedding present ? " " Maxim gave them to me . " " H 'm . I like them . We must give you something of course . What do you want ? " " Oh , I do n't really know . You must n't bother , " I said . " My dear , do n't be absurd . I 'm not one to grudge you a present , even though we were n't asked to your wedding ! " " I hope you did not mind about that . Maxim wanted it to be abroad . " " Of course not . Very sensible of you both . After all , it was n't as though . . . " she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her bag . " Damn , have I broken the catch ? No , all is well . What was I saying ? I ca n't remember . Oh , yes , wedding presents . We must think of something . You probably do n't care for jewellery . " I did not answer . " It 's so different from the ordinary young couple , " she said . " The daughter of a friend of mine got married the other day , and of course they were started off in the usual way , with linen , and coffee sets , and dining-room chairs , and all that . I gave rather a nice standard lamp . Cost me a fiver at Harrod 's . If you do go to London to buy clothes mind you go to my woman , Madame Carroux . She has damn good taste , and she does n't rook you . " She got up from the dressing-table , and pulled at her skirt . " Do you suppose you will have a lot of people down ? " she said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " it " Funny old boy , one never quite knows with him . At one time one could not get a bed in the house , the place would be chock-ablock . I ca n't somehow see you . " she stopped abruptly , and patted my arm . " Oh , well , " she said , " we 'll see . It 's a pity you don'troe Daphne du Maurierride or shoot , you must miss such a lot . You do n't sail by any chance , do you ? " " No , " I said . " Thank God for that , " she said . She went to the door , and I followed her down the corridor . " Come and see us if you feel like it , " she said . " I always expectpeople to ask themselves . Life is too short to send out invitations . " " Thank you very much , " I said . We came to the head of the stairs looking down upon the hall . The men were standing on the steps outside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " I felt a spot of rain , so we 've put on the cover . Maxim says the glass is falling . " Beatrice took my hand , and bending down gave me a swift peck on my cheek . " Good-bye , " she said , " forgive me if I 've asked you a lot of rude questions , my dear , and said all sort of things I should n't . Tact never was my strong point , as Maxim will tell you . And , as I told you before , you 're not a bit what I expected . " She looked at me direct , her lips pursed in a whistle , and then took a cigarette from her bag , and flashed her lighter . " You see , " she said , snapping the top , and walking down the stairs , " you are so very different from Rebecca . " And we came out on to the steps and found the sun had gone behind a bank of cloud , a little thin rain was falling , and Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 10WE WATCHED the car disappear round the sweep of the drive , and then Maxim took my arm and said , " Thank God that 's that . Get a coat quickly , and come out . Damn the rain , I want a walk . I ca n't stand this sitting about . " He looked white and strained , and I wondered why the entertaining of Beatrice and Giles , his own sister and brother-in-law , should have tired him so . " Wait while I run upstairs for my coat , " I said . " There 's a heap of mackintoshes in the flower-room , get one of them , " he said impatiently , " women are always half-an-hour when they go to their bedrooms . Robert , fetch a coat from the flower-REBECCA 103room , will you , for Mrs. de Winter ? There must be half-a-dozen raincoats hanging there , left by people at one time or another . " He was already standing in the drive , and calling to Jasper . " Come on , you lazy little beggar , and take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in circles , barking hysterically at the prospect of his walk . " Shut up , you idiot , " said Maxim , " what on earth is Robert doing ? " Robert came running out of the hall carrying a raincoat , and I struggled into it hurriedly , fumbling with the collar . It was too big , of course , and too long , but there was no time to change it , and we set off together across the lawn to the woods , Jasper running in front . " I find a little of my family goes a very long way , " said Maxim . " Beatrice is one of the best people in the world , but she invariably puts her foot in it . " I was not sure where Beatrice had blundered , and thought it better not to ask . Perhaps he still resented the chat about his health before lunch . " What did you think of her ? " he went on . " I liked her very much , " I said , " she was very nice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you about out here , after lunch ? " " Oh , I do n't know . I think I did most of the talking . I was telling her about Mrs. Van Hopper , and how you and I met , and all that . She said I was quite different to what she expected . " " What the devil did she expect ? " " Someone much smarter , more sophisticated , I imagine . A social butterfly , she said . " Maxim did not answer for a moment , he bent down , and threw a stick for Jasper . " Beatrice can sometimes be infernally unintelligent , " he said . We climbed the grass bank above the lawns , and plunged into the woods . The trees grew very close together , and it was dark . We trod upon broken twigs , and last year 's leaves , and here and there the fresh green stubble of the young bracken , and the shoots of the bluebells soon to blossom . Jasper was silent now , his nose to the ground . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair ? " I said . He stared down at me in astonishment . " Your hair ? " he said , " why on earth do you ask ? Of course I like it . What 's the matter with it ? " " Oh , nothing , " I said , " I just wondered . " " How funny you are , " he said. 104 Daphne du MaurierWe came to a clearing in the woods , and there were two paths , going in opposite directions . Jasper took the right-hand path withouthesitation . " Not that way , " called Maxim , " come on , old chap . " The dog looked back at us and stood there , wagging his tail , but did not return . " Why does he want to go that way ? " I asked . " I suppose he 's used to it , " said Maxim briefly , " it leads to a small cove , where we used to keep a boat . Come on , Jasper , old man . " We turned into the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked over my shoulder and saw that Jasper was followingus . " This brings us to the valley I told you about , " said Maxim , " and you shall smell the azaleas . Never mind the rain , it will bring out the scent . " He seemed all right again now , happy and cheerful , the Maxim I knew and loved , and he began talking about Frank Crawley and what a good fellow he was , so thorough and reliable , and devoted to Manderley . " This is better , " I thought , " this is like it was in Italy , " and I smiled up at him , squeezing his arm , relieved that the odd strained look on his face had passed away , and while I said " Yes , " and " Really ? " and " Fancy , darling , " my thoughts wandered back to Beatrice , wondering why her presence should have disturbed him , what she had done ; and I thought too of all she had said about his temper , how he lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year . She must know him , of course ; she was his sister . But it was not what I had thought ; it was not my idea of Maxim . I could see him moody , difficult , irritable perhaps , but not angry as she had inferred , not passionate . Perhaps she had exaggerated ; people very often were wrong about their relatives . " There , " said Maxim suddenly , " take a look at that . " We stood on a slope of a wooded hill , and the path wound away before us to a valley , by the side of a running stream . There were no dark trees here , no tangled undergrowth , but on either side of the narrow path stood azaleas and rhododendrons , not blood-coloured like the giants in the drive , but salmon , white , and gold , things of beauty and of grace , drooping their lovely , delicate heads in the soft summer rain . The air was full of their scent , sweet and heady , and it seemed to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ waters of the stream , and become one with the falling rain and theREBECCA I05tumbling of the little stream , and the quiet rain . When Maxim spoke , his voice was hushed too , gentle and low , as if he had no wish to break upon the silence . " We call it the Happy Valley , " he said . We stood quite still , not speaking , looking down upon the clear white faces of the flowers closest to us , and Maxim stooped , and picked up a fallen petal and gave it to me . It was crushed and bruised , and turning brown at the curled edge , but as I rubbed it across my hand the scent rose to me , sweet and strong , vivid as the living tree from which it came . Then the birds began . First a blackbird , his note clear and cool above the running stream , and after a moment he had answer , from his fellow hidden in the woods behind us , and soon the still air about us was made turbulent with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the fragrance of the white petals followed us too . It was disturbing , like an enchanted place . I had not thought it could be as beautiful as this . The sky , now overcast and sullen , so changed from the early afternoon , and the steady , insistent rain could not disturb the soft quietude of the valley ; the rain and the rivulet mingled with one another , and the liquid note of the blackbird fell upon the damp air in harmony with them both . I brushed the dripping heads of the azaleas as I passed , so close they grew together , bordering the path . Little drops of water fell on to my hands from the soaked petals . There were petals at my feet too , brown and sodden , bearing their scent upon them still , and a richer , older scent as well , the smell of deep moss and bitter earth , the stems of bracken , and the twisted buried roots of trees . I held Maxim 's hand and I had not spoken . The spell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last was the core of Manderley , the Manderley I would know and learn to love . The first drive was forgotten , the black , herded woods , the glaring rhododendrons , luscious and over-proud . And the vast house too , the silence of that echoing hall , the uneasy stillness of the west wing , wrapped in dust-sheets . There I was an interloper , wanderingin rooms that did not know me , sitting at a desk and in a chair that was not mine . Here it was different . The Happy Valley knew no trespassers . We came to the end of the path , and the flowers formed an archway above our heads . We bent down , passing underneath , and when I stood straight again , brushing the raindropsfrom my hair , I saw that the valley was behind us , and the azaleas , and the trees , and , as Maxim had described to me thatro6 Daphne du Maurierafternoon many weeks ago in Monte Carlo , we were standing in a little narrow cove , the shingle hard and white under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shore beyond us . Maxim smiled down at me , watching the bewilderment on my face . " It 's a shock , is n't it ? " he said , " no one ever expects it . The contrastis too sudden , it almost hurts . " He picked up a stone and flung it across the beach for Jasper . " Fetch it , good man , " and Jasper streaked away in search of the stone , his long black ears flapping in the wind . The enchantment was no more , the spell was broken . We were mortal again , two people playing on a beach . We threw more stones , went to the water 's edge , Hung ducks and drakes , and fished for driftwood . The tide had turned , and came lapping in the bay . The small rocks were covered , the seaweed washed on the stones . We rescued a big floating plank and carried it up the beach above high-water mark . Maxim turned to me , laughing , wiping the hair out of his eyes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sea spray . And then we looked round , and saw that Jasper had disappeared . We called and whistled , and he did not come . I looked anxiously towards the mouth of the cove where the waves were breaking upon the rocks . " No , " said Maxim , " we should have seen him , he ca n't have fallen . Jasper , you idiot , where are you ? Jasper , Jasper ? " " Perhaps he 's gone back to the Happy Valley ? " I said . " He was by that rock a minute ago , sniffing a dead sea-gull , " said Maxim . We walked up the beach towards the valley once again . " Jasper , Jasper ? " called Maxim . In the distance , beyond the rocks to the right of the beach , I heard a short , sharp bark . " Hear that ? " I said . " He 's climbed over this way . " I began to scramble up the slippery rocks in the direction of the bark . " Come back , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to go that way . The fool of a dog must look after himself . " I hesitated , looking down from my rock . " Perhaps he 's fallen , " I said , " poor little chap . Let me fetch him . " Jasper barked again , further away this time . " Oh , listen , " I said , " I must get him . It 's quite safe , is n't it ? The tide wo n't have cut him off ? " " He 's all right , " said Maxim irritably , " why not leave him ? He knows his own way back . " REBECCA I07I pretended not to hear , and began scrambling over the rocks towards Jasper . Great jagged boulders screened the view , and I slipped and stumbled on the wet rocks , making my way as best I could in Jasper 's direction . It was heartless of Maxim to leave Jasper , I thought , and I could not understand it . Besides , the tide was coming in . I came up beside the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond it . And I saw , to my surprise , that I was looking down into another cove , similar to the one I had left , , but wider and more rounded . A small stone breakwater had been thrown out across the cove for shelter , and behind it the bay formed a tiny natural harbour . There was a buoy anchored there , but no boat . The beach in the cove was white shingle , like the one behind me , but steeper , shelving suddenly to the sea . The woods came right down to the tangle of seaweed marking high water , encroaching almost to the rocks themselves , and at the fringe of the woods was a long low building , half cottage , half boat-house , built of the same stone as the breakwater . There was a man on the beach , a fisherman perhaps , in long boots and a sou'wester , and Jasper was barking at him , running round him in circles , darting at his boots . The man took no notice , he was bending down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I shouted , " Jasper , come here . " The dog looked up , wagging his tail , but he did not obey me . He went on baiting the solitary figure on the beach . I looked over my shoulder . There was still no sign of Maxim . I climbed down over the rocks to the beach below . My feet made a crunching noise across the shingle , and the man looked up at the sound . I saw then that he had the small slit eyes of an idiot , and the red , wet mouth . He smiled at me , showing toothless gums . " G'day , " he said . " Dirty , ai n't it ? " " Good afternoon , " I said . " No , I 'm afraid it 's not very nice weather . " He watched me with interest , smiling all the while . " Diggin ' for shell , " he said . " No shell here . Been diggin ' since forenoon . " " Oh , " I said , " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's right , " he said , " no shell here . " " Come on , Jasper , " I said , " its getting late . Come on , old boy . " But Jasper was in an infuriating mood . Perhaps the wind andsea had gone to his head , for he backed away from me , barkingstupidly , and began racing round the beach after nothing at all. ro8 Daphne du MaurierI saw he would never follow me , and I had no lead . I turned to the man , who had bent down again to his futile digging . " Have you got any string ? " I said . " Eh ? " he said . " Have you got any string ? " I repeated . " No shell here , " he said , shaking his head . " Been diggin ' since forenoon . " He nodded his head at me , and wiped his pale blue watery eyes . " I want something to tie the dog , " I said . " He wo n't follow me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smiled his poor idiot 's smile . " All right , " I said , " it does n't matter . " He looked at me uncertainly , and then leant forward , and poked me in the chest . " I know that dog , " he said , " he comes fro ' the house . " " Yes , " I said . " I want him to come back with me now . " " He 's not yourn , " he said . " He 's Mr. de Winter 's dog , " I said gently . " I want to take him back to the house . " " Eh ? " he said . I called Jasper once more , but he was chasing a feather blown by the wind . I wondered if there was any string in the boat-house , and I walked up the beach towards it . There must have been a garden once , but now the grass was long and overgrown , crowded with nettles . The windows were boarded up . No doubt the door was locked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ To my surprise it opened after the first stiffness , and I went inside , bending my head because of the low door . I expected to find the usual boat store , dirty and dusty with disuse , ropes and blocks and oars upon the floor . The dust was there , and the dirt too in places , but there were no ropes or blocks . The room was furnished , and ran the whole length of the cottage . There was a desk in the corner , a table and chairs , and a bed-sofa pushed against the wall . There was a dresser too , with cups and plates . Bookshelves , the books inside them , and models of ships standing on the top of the shelves . For a moment I thought it must be inhabited  --  perhaps the poor man on the beach lived here  --  but I looked around me again , and saw no sign of recent occupation . That rusted grate knew no fire , this dusty floor no footsteps , and the china there on the dresser was blue-spotted with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the place . Cobwebs spun threads upon the ship 's models , making their own ghostly rigging . No one lived here . No one came here . The door had creaked on its hinges when I opened it . The rainREBECCA 109pattered on the roof with a hollow sound , and tapped upon the boarded windows . The fabric of the sofa-bed had been nibbled by mice or rats . I could see the jagged holes , and the frayed edges . It was damp in the cottage , damp and chill . Dark , and oppressive . I did not like it . I had no wish to stay there . I hated the hollow sound of the rain pattering on the roof . It seemed to echo in the room itself , and I heard the water dripping too into the rusted grate . I looked about me for some string . There was nothing that would serve my purpose , nothing at all . There was another door at the end of the room , and I went to it , and opened it , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the odd , uneasy feeling that I might come upon something unawares , that I had no wish to see . Somethingthat might harm me , that might be horrible . It was nonsense of course , and I opened the door . It was only a boat store after all . Here were the ropes and blocks I had expected , two or three sails , fenders , a small punt , pots of paints , all the litter and junk that goes with the using of boats . A ball of twine lay on a shelf , a rusted clasp-knife beside it . This would be all I needed for Jasper . I opened the knife , and cut a length of twine , and came back into the room again . The rain still fell upon the roof , and into the grate . I came out of the cottage hurriedly , not looking behind me , trying not to see the torn sofa and the mildewed china , the spun cobwebs on the model ships , and so through the creaking gate and on to the white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was watching me , Jasper at his side . " Come along , Jasper , " I said , " come on , good dog . " I bent down , and this , time he allowed me to touch him and pull hold of his collar . " I found some string in the cottage , " I said to the man . He did not answer , and I tied the string loosely round Jasper 's collar . " Good afternoon , " I said , tugging at Jasper . The man nodded , staring at me with his narrow idiot 's eyes . " I saw ' ee go in yonder , " he said . " Yes , " I said , " it 's all right . Mr. de Winter wo n't mind . " " She do n't go in there now , " he said . " No , " I said , " not now . " " She 's gone in the sea , ai n't she ? " he said , " she wo n't come back no more ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll not come back . " " I never said nothing , did I ? " he said. r r o Daphne du Maurier " No , of course not , do n't worry , " I said . He bent down again to his digging , muttering to himself . I went across the shingle and I saw Maxim waiting for me by the rocks , his hands in his pockets . " I 'm sorry , " I said . " Jasper would not come . I had to get some string . " He turned abruptly on his heel , and made towards the woods . " Are n't we going back over the rocks ? " I said . " What 's the point , we 're here now , " he said briefly . We went up past the cottage and struck into a path through the woods . " I 'm sorry I was such a time , it was Jasper 's fault , " I said , " he kept barking at the man . Who was he ? " " Only Ben , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poor devil . His old father used to be one of the keepers , they live near the home farm . Where did you get that piece of twine ? " " I found it in the cottage on the beach , " I said . " Was the door open ? " he asked . " Yes , I pushed it open . I found the string in the other room , where the sails were , and a small boat . " " Oh , " he said shortly . " Oh , I see , " and then he added , after a moment or two : " That cottage is supposed to be locked , the door has no business to be open . " I said nothing , it was not my affair . " Did Ben tell you the door was open ? " " No , " I said , " he did not seem to understand anything I asked him . " " He makes out he 's worse than he is , " said Maxim . " He can talk quite intelligibly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and out of the cottage dozens of times , and did not want you to know . " " I do n't think ' so , " I answered ; " the place looked deserted , quite untouched . There was dust everywhere , and no footmarks . It was terribly damp . I 'm afraid those books will be quite spoilt , and the chairs , and that sofa . There are rats there too , they have eaten away some of the covers . " Maxim did not reply . He walked at a tremendous pace , and the climb up from the beach was steep . It was very different from the Happy Valley . The trees were dark here and close together , there were no azaleas brushing the path . The rain dripped heavily from the thick branches . It splashed on my collar and trickled down my neck . I shivered , it was unpleasant , like a cold finger . My legs ached , after the unaccustomed scramble over the rocks . And jasper laggedREBECCA IIIbehind , weary from his wild scamper , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jasper , for God 's sake , " said Maxim . " Make him walk up , pull at the twine or something , ca n't you ? Beatrice was right . The dog is much too fat . " " It 's your fault , " I said , " you walk so fast . We ca n't keep up with you . " If you had listened to me instead of rushing wildly over those rocks we would have been home by now , " said Maxim , " Jasper knew his way back perfectly . I ca n't think what you wanted to go after him for . " " I thought he might have fallen , and I was afraid of the tide , " I said . " Is it likely I should have left the dog had there been any questionof the tide ? " said Maxim . " I told you not to go on those rocks , and now you are grumbling because you are tired . " " I 'm not grumbling , " I said . " Anyone , even if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at this pace . I thought you would come with me when I went after Jasper anyway , instead of staying behind . " " Why should I exhaust myself careering after the damn dog ? " he said . " It was no more exhausting careering after Jasper on the rocks than it was careering after driftwood on the beach , " I answered . " You just say that because you have not any other excuse . " " My good child , what am I supposed to excuse myself about ? " " Oh , I do n't know , " I said wearily , " let 's stop this . " " Not at all , you began it . What do you mean by saying I was trying to find an excuse ? Excuse for what ? " " Excuse for not having come with me over the rocks , I suppose , " I said . " Well , and why do you think I did not want to cross to the other beach ? " " Oh , Maxim , how should I know ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not want to , that 's all . I could see it in your face . " " See what in my face ? " " I 've already told you . I could see you did not want to go . Oh , do let 's have an end to it . I 'm sick to death of the subject . " " All women say that when they 've lost an argument . All right , I did not want to go to the other beach . Will that please you ? I never go near the bloody place , or that God-damned cottage . And112 Daphne du Maurierif you had my memories you would not want to go there either , or talk about it , or even think about it . There . You can digest that if you like , and I hope it satisfies you . " His face was white , and his eyes strained and wretched with that dark lost look they had had when I first met him . I put out my hand to him , I took hold of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ please , " I said . " What 's the matter ? " he said roughly . " I do n't want you to look like that , " I said . " It hurts too much . Please , Maxim . Let 's forget all we said . A futile silly argument . I 'm sorry , darling , I 'm sorry . Please let everything be all right . " " We ought to have stayed in Italy , " he said . " We ought never to have come back to Manderley . Oh , God , what a fool I was to come back . " He brushed through the trees impatiently , striding even faster than before , and I had to run to keep pace with him , catching at my breath , tears very near the surface , dragging poor Jasper after me on the end of his string . At last we came to the top of the path , and I saw its fellow branching left to the Happy Valley . We had climbed the path then that Jasper had wished to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now why Jasper had turned to it . It led to the beach he knew best , and the cottage . It was his old routine . We came out on to the lawns , and went across them to the house without a word . Maxim 's face was hard , with no expression . He went straight into the hall and on to the library without looking at me . Frith was it1 the hall . " We want tea at once , " said Maxim , and he shut the library door . I fought to keep back my tears . Frith must not see them . He would think we had been quarrelling , and he would go to the servants ' hall and say to them all , " Mrs. de Winter was crying in the hall just now . It looks as though things are not going very well . " I turned away , so that Frith should not see my face . He came towards me though , he began to help me off with my mackintosh . " I 'll put your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . " Thank you , Frith , " I replied , my face still away from him . " Not a very pleasant afternoon for a walk I fear , Madam . " " No , " I said . " No , it was not very nice . " " Your handkerchief , Madam ? " he said , picking up something thatREBECCA 113had fallen on the floor . " Thank you , " I said , putting it in my pocket . I was wondering whether to go upstairs or whether to follow Maxim to the library . Frith took the coat to the flower-room . I stood there , hesitating , biting my nails . Frith came back again . He looked surprised to see me still there . " There is a good fire in the library now , Madam . " " Thank you , Frith , " I said . I walked slowly across the hall to the library . I opened the door and Went in . Maxim was sitting in his chair , Jasper at his feet , the old @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paper , though it lay on the arm of the chair beside him . I went and knelt down by his side and put my face close to his . " Do n't be angry with me any more , " I whispered . He took my face in his hands , and looked down at me with his tired , strained eyes . " I 'm not angry with you , " he said . " Yes , " I said . " I 've made you unhappy . It 's the same as making you angry . You 're all wounded and hurt and torn inside . I ca n't bear to see you like this . I love you so much . " " Do you ? " he said . " Do you ? " He held me very tight , and his eyes questioned me , dark and uncertain , the eyes of a child in pain , a child in fear . " What is it , darling ? " I said . " Why do you look like that ? " I heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back on my heels , pretending to reach for a log to throw on the fire , while Frith came into the room followed by Robert , and the ritual of our tea began . The performance of the day before was repeated , the placing of the table , the laying of the snow-white cloth , the putting down of cakes and crumpets , the silver kettle of hot water placed on its little flame , while Jasper , wagging his tail , his ears stretched back in anticipation , watched my face . Five minutes must have passed before we were alone again , and when I looked at Maxim I saw the colour had come back into his face , the tired , lost look was gone , and he was reaching for a sandwich . " Having all that crowd to lunch was the trouble , " he said . " Poor old Beatrice always does rub me up the wrong way . We used to scrap like dogs as children . I 'm so fond of her too , bless her . Such a relief though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , we 'll have to go over and see Granny some time . Pour out my tea , sweetheart , and forgive me for being a bear to you . " 1 14 Daphne du MaurierIt was over then . The episode was finished . We must not speak of it again . He smiled at me over his cup of tea , and then reached for the newspaper on the arm of his chair . The smile was my reward . Like a pat on the head to Jasper . Good dog then , lie down , do n't worry me any more . I was Jasper again . I was back where I had been before . I took a piece of crumpet and divided it between the two dogs . I did not want it myself , I was not hungry . I felt very weary now , very tired in a dull , spent way . I looked at Maxim but he was reading his paper , he had folded it over to another page . My fingers were messy with the butter from the crumpet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I drew it out , a tiny scrap of a thing , lace-edged . I stared at it , frowning , for it was not mine . I remembered then that Frith had picked it up from the stone floor of the hall . It must have fallen out of the pocket in the mackintosh . I turned it over in my hand . It was grubby , little bits of fluff from the pocket lung to it . It must have been in the mackintosh pocket for a long time . There was a monogram in the corner . A tall sloping R , with the letters de W interlaced . The R dwarfed the other letters , the tail of it ran down into the cambric , away from the laced edge . It was only a small handkerchief , quite a scrap of a thing . It had been rolled in a ball and put away in the pocket and forgotten . I must have been the first person to put on that mackintosh since the handkerchief was used . She who had worn the coat then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoulders , for I had found it big and over-long , and the sleeves had come below my wrists . Some of the buttons were missing . She had not bothered then to do it up . She had thrown it over her shoulders like a cape , or worn it loose , hanging open , her hands deep in the pockets . There was a pink mark upon the handkerchief . The mark of lipstick . She had rubbed her lips with the handkerchief , and then rolled it in a ball , and left it in the pocket . I wiped my fingers with the handkerchief , and as I did so I noticed that a dull scent clung about it still . A scent I recognised , a scent I knew . I shut my eyes and tried to remember . It was something elusive , something faint and fragrant that I could not name . I had breathed it before , touched it surely , that very afternoon . And then I knew that the vanished scent upon the handkerchief was the same as the crushed white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was wet and cold for quite a week , as it often can be in the west country in early summer , and we did not go down to the beach again . I could see the sea from the terrace , and the lawns . It looked grey and uninviting , great rollers sweeping in to the bay past the beacon on the headland . I pictured them surging into the little cove and breaking with a roar upon the rocks , then running swift and strong to the shelving beach . If I stood on the terrace and listened I could hear the murmur of the sea below me , low and sullen . A dull , persistent sound that never ceased . And the gulls flew inland too , driven by the weather . They hovered above the house in circles , wheeling and crying , flapping their spread wings . I began to understand why some people could rfot bear the clamour of the sea . It has a mournful harping note sometimes , and the very persistence of it , that eternal roll and thunder and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was glad our rooms were in the east wing and I could lean out of my window and look down upon the rose-garden . For sometimes I could not sleep , and getting softly out of bed in the quiet night I would wander to the window , and lean there , my arms upon the sill , and the air would be very peaceful , very still . I could not hear the restless sea , and because I could not hear it my thoughts would be peaceful too . They would not carry me down that steep path through the woods to the grey cove and the deserted cottage . I did not want to think about the cottage . I remembered it too often in the day . The memory of it nagged at me whenever I saw the sea from the terrace . For I would see once more the blue spots on the china , the spun webs on the little masts of those model ships , and the rat holes on the sofa-bed . I would remember the pattering of the rain on the roof @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his narrow watery blue eyes , his sly idiot 's smile . These things disturbed me , I was not happy about them . I wanted to forget them but at the same time I wanted to know why they disturbed me , why they made me uneasy and unhappy . Somewhere , at the back of my mind , there was a frightened furtive seed of curiosity that grew slowly and stealthily , for all my denial of it , andrr 6 Daphne du MaurierI knew all the doubt and the anxiety of the child who has been told , " these things are not discussed , they are forbidden . " I could not forget the white , lost look in Maxim 's eyes when we came up the path through the woods , and I could not forget his words , " Oh , God , what a fool I was to come back . " It was all my fault , because I had gone down into the bay . I had opened up a road into the past again . And although Maxim had recovered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together , sleeping , eating , walking , writing letters , driving to the village , working hour by hour through our day , I knew there was a barrier between us because of it . He walked alone , on the other side , and I must not come to him . And I became nervous and fearful that some heedless word , some turn rn a careless conversation should bring that expression back to his eyes again . I began to dread any mention of the sea , for the sea might lead to boats , to accidents , to drowning . . . . Even Frank Crawley , who came to lunch one day , put me in a little fever of fear when he said something about the sailing races in Kerrith harbour , three miles away . I looked steadily at my plate , a stab of sickness in my heart at once , but Maxim went on talking quite naturally , he did not seem to mind , while I sat in a sweat of uncertaintywondering what would happen and where the conversationwould lead us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ room , and I remember getting up and going to the side-board , and taking some more cheese , not wanting it , so as not to be at the table with them , listening ; humming a little tune to myself so I could not hear . I was wrong of course , morbid , stupid , this was the hyper-sensitive behaviourof a neurotic , not the normal happy self I knew myself to be . But I could not help it . I did not know what to do . My shyness and gaucherie became worse , too , making me stolid and dumb when people came to the house . For we were called upon , I remember , during those first weeks , by people who lived near us in the county , and the receiving of them , and the shaking hands , and the spinning out of the formal half-hour became a worse ordeal than I first anticipated , because of this new fear of mine that they would talk about something that must not be discussed . The agony of those wheels on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first wild rush for flight to my own room . The scrambled dab of powder on my nose , the hasty comb through my hair , and then the inevitable knock on the door and the entrance of the cards on a silver salver . REBECCA 117 " All right . I 'll be down immediately . " The clap of my heels on the stairs and across the hall , the opening of the library door or , worse still , that long , cold , lifeless drawing-room , and the strange woman waiting there , or two of them perhaps , or a husband and a wife . " How do you do ? I 'm so sorry , Maxim is in the garden somewhere , Frith has gone to find him . " " We felt we must come and pay our respects to the bride . " A little laughter , a little flurry of chat , a pause , a glance round the room . " Manderley is looking as charming as ever . Do n't you love it ? " " Oh , yes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anxiety to please , those schoolgirl phrases would escape from me again , those words I never used except in moments like these , " Oh , ripping " ; and " Oh , topping " ; and " absolutely " ; and " priceless " ; even , I think , to one dowager who had carried a lorgnette " cheerio . " My relief at Maxim 's arrival would be tempered by the fear they might say something indiscreet , and I became dumb at once , a set smile on my lips , my hands in my lap . They would turn to Maxim then , talking of people and places I had not met or did not know , and now and again I would find their eyes upon me , doubtful , rather bewildered . I could picture them saying to one another as they drove away , " My dear , what a dull girl . She scarcely opened her mouth " ; and then the sentence I had first heard upon Beatrice 's lips , haunting me ever since , a sentence I read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's so different to Rebecca . " Sometimes I would glean little snatches of information to add to my secret store . A word dropped here at random , a question , a passing phrase . And , if Maxim was not with me , the hearing of them would be a furtive , rather painful pleasure , guilty knowledge learnt in the dark . I would return a call perhaps , for Maxim was punctilious in these matters and would not spare me , and if he did not come with me I must brave the formality alone , and there would be a pause in the conversation while I searched for something to say . " Will you be entertaining much at Manderley , Mrs. de Winter ? " they would say and my answer would come , " I do n't know , Maxim has not said much about it up to the present . " " No , of course not , it 's early yet . I believe the house was generally full of people in the old days . " Another pause . " People @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremendous parties . " " Yes , " I would say . " Yes , so I have heard . " A18 Daphne du Maurierfurther pause , and then the lowered voice that is always used about the dead or in a place of worship . " She was so tremendously popular , you know . Such a personality . " " Yes , " I would say . " Yes , of course . " And after a moment or so I would glance at my watch under cover of my glove , and say " I 'm afraid I ought to be going , it must be after four . " " Wo n't you stay for tea ? We always have it quarter-past . " No  --  no , really , thanks most awfully . I promised Maxim ... my sentence would go trailing off into nothing , but the meaning would be understood . We would both rise to our feet , both of us knowing I was not deceived about her offer to tea nor she in my mention of a promise to Maxim . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if , having got into the car and waved a hand to my hostess on the doorstep , I suddenly opened it again , and said " I do n't think I 'll go back after all . Let 's go to your drawing-room again and sit down . I 'll stay to dinner if you like or stop the night . " I used to wonder if convention and good county manners would brave the surprise , and whether a smile of welcome would be summoned to the frozen face . " But of course ! How very delightful of you to suggest it . " I used to wish I had the courage to try . But instead the door would slam , the car would go bowling away down the smooth gravel drive , and my late hostess would wander back to her room with a sigh of relief and become herself again . It was the wife of the bishop in the neighbouring cathedral town who said to me , " Will your husband revive the Manderley fancy dress ball , do you suppose ? Such a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I had to smile as though I knew all about it and say , " We have not decided . There have been so many things to do and to discuss . " " Yes , I suppose so . But I hope it wo n't be dropped . You must use your influence with him . There was not one last year of course . But I remember two years ago , the bishop and I went , and it was quite enchanting . Manderley so lends itself to anything like that . The hall looked wonderful . They danced there , and had the music in the gallery , it was all so in keeping . A tremendous thing to organise but everybody appreciated it so . " " Yes , " I said . " Yes , I must ask Maxim about it . " I thought of the docketed pigeon-holes in the desk in the morningroom , I pictured the stack upon stack of invitation cards , the long list of names , the addresses , and I could see a woman sitting there at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , andREBECCA 119reaching for the invitation cards , dipping her pen in the ink , writing upon them swift and sure in that long , slanting hand . " There was a garden party , too , we went to one summer , " said the bishop 's wife . " Everything always so beautifully done . The flowers at their best . A glorious day I remember . Tea was served at little tables in the rose-garden , such an attractive original idea . Of course , she was so clever ... " She stopped , turning a little pink , fearing a loss of tact , but I agreed with her at once to save embarrassment , and I heard myself saying boldly , brazenly , " Rebecca must have been a wonderful per-son . " I could not believe that I had said the name at last . I waited , wondering what would happen . I had said the name . I had said the word Rebecca aloud . It was a tremendous relief . It was as though I had taken a purge and rid myself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it aloud . I wondered if the bishop 's wife saw the flush on my face , but she went on smoothly with the conversation , and I listened to her greedily , like an eavesdropper at a shuttered window . " You never met her then ? " she asked , and when I shook my head she hesitated a moment , a little uncertain of her ground . " We never knew her well personally , you know , the bishop was only inducted here four years ago , but of course she received us when we went to the ball and to the garden party . We dined there , too , one winter . Yes , she was a very lovely creature . So full of life . " " She seems to have been so good at everything too , " I said , my voice just careless enough to show I did not mind , while I played with the fringe of my glove . " It 's not often you get someone who is clever and beautiful and fond of sport . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bishop 's wife , " she was certainlyvery gifted . I can see her now , standing at the foot of the stairs on the night of the ball , shaking hands with everybody , that cloud of dark hair against the very white skin , and her costume suited her so . Yes , she was very beautiful . " " She ran the house herself , too , " I said , smiling , as if to say , " I am quite at my ease , I often discuss her . " " It must have taken a lot of time and thought . I 'm afraid I leave it to the housekeeper . " " Oh , well , we ca n't all do everything . And you are very young , are n't you ? No doubt in time , when you have settled down . Besides , you have your own hobby , have n't you ? Someone told me you were fond of sketching . "                  @ @ @
