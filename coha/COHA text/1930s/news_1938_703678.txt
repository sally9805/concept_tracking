txt Groundwork for the new national defense plans which are expected to form an important part of President Roosevelt 's opening messages to the new Congress has been virtually completed . While details remain closely guarded secrets . the general form of the program appears to be shaping up to two phases : first , an increase in actual military strength with particular emphasis on airplanes as a first line of defense ; and , second , development of an effective industrial mobilization plan with special stress on capacity to produce wartime needs and the elimination of time-consuming " bottlenecks " . No official hints as to probe ble coat during the next fiscal year , beginning July 1 . 1939. have been dropped but the best guesses  --  and they are largely guesses ? range below $500. - 000.000 in addition , of course , to the approximately $1,000,000.000 that will be spent for national defense in the current fiscal year . program on ' Two-Veer Basis Indications now are that the entire program will be worked out on a two-year basis . This idea , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bringing the country 's air defense force up to a new minimum of . say . 11,000 planes and thus aid the development of what the War Department now regards as the all-important ability to turn out fighting ships on a mass production basis . Conferences between Assistant Secretary of War Johnsos and leading officials in the aviation industry , officially announced this week . primarily were concerned with capacity and willingness to cooperate in new defense plans . it was learned . Actual orders , of course , will await the completion of recommendations and action by Congress . The matter of possible government aid in new plant construction was no ' ; discussed . Conferences With Industrial Leaders The airplaneconferences were part ? and probably the last for the time being  --  of a series of conferences between government officials and industrial leaders on questions of mobilization and national defense . There have been conferences . for example , with the automobile industry and several other major manufacturing businesses . Through these conferences and its own investigations . the War Department is understood to have amassed the most complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made available for defense purposes . Estimates as to the probable cost of as many as 7.500 new fighting planes within a period as short as two years are not available in any official quarters here . It would require outlays for new capacity as well as planes and equipment since total United States output of airplanes for all purposes was only a little more than 3.000 in the 1937 calendar year . A large part of the industrial mobilization program , officials hope . will not cost the government anything in direct outlays . Development of new power generating facilities . for example , has been discussed entirely in terma of private financing with , perhaps , some government assistance in the form of loans rather than direct subsidies . Major Expense for Aircraft The major expense for new armaments will probably , therefore , be the cost of airplanes , and another major item would be the present proposal to have a six-months supply of equipment ready for an army of a million men . Other proposals , though prominently mentioned , are not likely to bulk large in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . for instance , that $25.000.000 would purchase an adequate reserve supply of the so-called strategic metals in addition to whatever supplies already have been obtained for future use . While no estimates have ever been made public , it . is probable that substantially less than $50.000.000 would assure the government of - mass production " facilities to produce , through private industry , the 55 - critical items- which War Department studies have shown are so different from any ordinary articles of peacetime production as to make them unavailable in large quantities in the event of a national emergency . 92.000.000 for Educational Orders Two million dollars for this purpose . achieved through educational orders . were made available under the current year 's budget . Tne net cost of the new national defense program to be proposed to Congress will be reduced , of course , by the extent to which defense spending aids business and cuts the government 's relief load . No direct shift of relief labor to defense is contemplated , however Some officials believe the new program will be of considerabie direct assistance to business and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
