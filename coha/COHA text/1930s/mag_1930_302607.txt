The fog-topped Alleghenies have been the chief obstacle to a direct air passenger service between New York and Chicago . Last week National Air Transport , doubtless spurred by the opening of Transcontinental &; Western Air 's coast-to-coast line ( TIME , Nov. 3 ) , announced passenger service to begin Dec. 1 over its radio-marked mail route from New York via Cleveland and Toledo to Chicago . In trimotored Fords , streamlined and otherwise " cleaned-up " to cruise at 125 m.p.h. , passengers and mail will make the westward flight in eight hours . Boosted along by prevailing winds , the eastbound planes should take only 6hr . Fare : $59.50. * <P> Meeting its sister company , Boeing Air Transport ( both subsidiaries of United Aircraft &; Transport Corp. ) at Chicago , N. A. T. 's new service completes another through passageway for transcontinental passengers . The California-bound traveler reaches Chicago by early evening in ample time to board Boeing 's night mail plane to the coast-total flying schedule 28 hr . But unless the mail load is light , in which case a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wait overnight in Chicago for the morning transport , arriving in San Francisco the morning after that . When enough travelers appear to demand it , large passenger planes may be flown regularly on the night schedule . At Salt Lake City the passenger may transfer to another United Aircraft division , Varney Air Lines , to reach Portland , Spokane , Seattle . <P> * Fastest trains , notably the 20th Century Limited and Broadway Limited , schedule 20 hr. , fare plus Pullman , $51.30.
