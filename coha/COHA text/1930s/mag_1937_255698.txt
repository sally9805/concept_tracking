There are eleven Freeports in the U. S.* , but last week the U. S. got its first free port-a small , ugly plot at Stapleton , Staten Island , in New York Harbor 's Narrows . <P> Much as customs inspection pains the homing U. S. tourist , it irks shippers more . For their relief and even more for the relief of U. S. ports that felt they were losing harbor business because of red tape , Congress passed the Foreign Trade Zones Act in 1934 , making a limited type of free port permissible for the first time in the highly protectionist U. S. Free ports , isolated free trade areas , were once prevalent in Europe , included such cities as Naples , Leghorn , Hamburg , Marseille . Today , sprinkled over the globe from Copenhagen to Curaao , are some 40 free ports , walled off on the seaward side of customs barriers , where shippers can unload , store and tranship goods without red tape . Stapleton is well suited for such a purpose for there New York 's late Mayor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of enormous piers which have failed to earn their upkeep . New York 's present Mayor Fiorello LaGuardia , who has pushed the free port idea for years , hopes to turn his predecessor 's liability into an asset by spending some $6,000,000 more . <P> Five piers , Nos. 12 through 16 , make up the new free port , which has an area of 78 acres . Of this , 60 acres are the murky waters of the bay , 18 are solid land . A 12-ft. wire fence , costing $30,000 , has been laced around the solid acres . To bar the bay to smugglers , two photoelectric eyes stare steadily across the half-mile harbor entrance . <P> Ships bringing goods into New York Harbor may unload at the free port without so much as a by-your-leave to the U. S. Treasury . In this zone , operated as a public utility under Federal supervision , goods may be " stored , broken up , repacked , assembled , distributed , sorted , graded , cleaned , mixed with foreign or domestic merchandise , " and finally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. by paying duty in the ordinary way . The various operations that can be performed in the free port are called " manipulation , " since by the terms of the law " manufacturing " is forbidden . Until now , if a shipper wished to " manipulate " arriving goods before re-exporting them , he had to take them through customs , pay the duty , take them back through the customs and wait for his 99% refund . <P> Though many authorities question the project 's profitableness , New York City expects to make money from its investment in Stapleton Free Port . In the first year it is estimated that the port will handle 120,000 tons of goods . Wharfage and other revenues from the five piers and warehouse will run to $150,000 , half again as much revenue as the Hylan piers have yielded in late years . That no eager freighters plowed past the vigilant electric eyes last week was due , according to Commissioner of Docks John McKenzie , to the fact that foreign shippers were not yet used to the idea @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
