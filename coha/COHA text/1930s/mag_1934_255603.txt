Last week Alpha , the robot , made its first public appearance in the U. S. One of the most ingenious automatons ever contrived by man , a grim and gleaming monster 6 ft. 4 in. tall , the robot was brought to Manhattan by its **25;7367;TOOLONG , Professor Harry May of London , and installed on the fifth floor of R. H. Macy &; Co. ' s department store . Encased from head to foot in chromium-plated steel armor , Alpha sat on a specially constructed dais with its cumbrous feet securely bolted to the floor , stared impassively over the knot of newshawks and store officials waiting for the first demonstration . The creature had a great sullen slit of a mouth , vast protuberant eyes , shaggy curls of rolled metal . In one mailed fist Alpha clutched a revolver . <P> Professor May , a dapper , blond , beak-nosed man in his middle thirties , signaled his assistant who drew a curtain behind the stage , revealing the massive control cabinets to which the robot was wired . <P> Said the crisp British @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> The eyes of the automaton glowed red . <P> ' ' Stand up ! " <P> The robot clicked and whirred . Pivoting at knees and waist , it slowly stood up . <P> " Raise your right arm . " Alpha gave a tremendous Nazi salute . <P> When commanded , the robot lowered its arm , raised the other , lowered it , turned its head from side to side , opened and closed its prognathous jaw , sat down . Then Impresario May asked Alpha a question : <P> " How old are you ? " <P> From the robot 's interior a cavernous Cockney voice responded : <P> " Fourteen years . " <P> May : What do you weigh ? <P> Alpha : One ton . <P> A dozen other questions and answers followed , some elaborately facetious . When May inquired what the automaton liked to eat , it responded with a minute-long discourse on the virtues of toast made with Macy 's automatic electric toaster . Finally when May requested the creature to raise its arm and fire the pistol , the arm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the firing-pin fell with a click . Professor May explained that store officials would not permit him to use blank cartridges . <P> Alpha 's master asked his auditors to give any of his questions and commands , using exactly the same words . Sometimes the robot responded promptly , sometimes not until Professor May repeated the words . <P> For such pictures as King Kong Hollywood has devised automatons capable of more complex movements than Alpha , but never one that responded to the human voice . Anxious to avoid any suspicion of ventriloquism or of a hidden assistant pushing control buttons , Professor May removed the robot 's breast plate , disclosing a mechanism like the interior of an ordinary radio . Publicly he explained that Alpha 's repertory of answers consisted of 20 or 30 recordings on wax cylinders , as in oldtime phonographs , which were run off in the control cabinets and reproduced from the loud speaker in the robot 's chest . Alpha can not really understand language , but he can respond to a variety of set questions the answers to which have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
