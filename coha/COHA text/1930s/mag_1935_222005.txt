Summoned for a special meeting in Philadelphia one day last week were the rich and conservative directors of United Gas Improvement Co. , oldest public utility holding company in the U. S. ( 1882 ) . They assembled to ponder a question which worried every other director , in every other utility holding company in the land : to register or not to register with the Securities &; Exchange Commission under the Public Utility Act of 1935 ? <P> SEC can not force a holding company to register but Title I of the Act states that " after Dec. 1 , 1935 , unless a holding company is registered . . . it shall be unlawful for such holding company , directly or indirectly " to transact normal business . Maximum fine for each violation : $200,000 . SEChairman James McCauley Landis has made registration easy , insisting that filing will not impair the powermen 's right to challenge the Act 's constitutionality at a later date . Last week in a final effort to woo the industry under the wire Chairman Landis offered to accept " conditional @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courts eventually find that the powermen had really surrendered their constitutional rights by filing . Pointedly hinting at the serious liabilities involved if the Act were upheld , SEC wheedled : " No possible ground in reason remains for any company to fail to file a simple notification and registration under these circumstances as a sheer precautionary matter for the protection of its investors . " <P> UGI directors , however , had their own notion of their duties to their 120,000 stockholders . They had at hand the opinion of Baltimore 's Federal District Judge William Caldwell Coleman , who had pronounced the Act unconstitutional " in its entirety " ( TIME , Nov. 18 ) . They also had the opinion of a Philadelphia law firm and of a Philadelphia lawyer , onetime ( 1922-27 ) U. S. Senator George Wharton Pepper . A stanch Republican , a devout Episcopalian whose portly figure is as familiar in Philadelphia as the facade of Independence Hall , Lawyer Pepper set a U. S. record for per-vote campaign expenditures when he ran unsuccessfully for re-election in 1926 ( $2.42 per Bepper ballot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm of Morgan , Lewis &; Bockius , Lawyer Pepper held the Public Utility Act unconstitutional , informing UGI directors : " Because we are convinced that this title can not be sustained under the commerce power , the postal power or any other power in the constitution , we have no hesitation in advising the United Gas Improvement Co. and its subsidiary holding companies to refuse to register under the Act . " <P> Accepting this unqualified advice , UGI directors unanimously put their $800,000,000 concern on record as the first holding company to refuse flatly to register . Promptly sought by UGI Lawyer Pepper were injunctions to restrain SEC , the Department of Justice , numerous individuals , including the Philadelphia postmaster , from enforcing the Act against UGI and subsidiaries . <P> Following UGI 's defiance , Consolidated Gas of New York let it be known that it , too , would ignore the law .
