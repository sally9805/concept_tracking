In San Francisco , Calif , last week the crew of Pacific Steamship 's liner H. F. Alexander struck for $30 dismissal wages . <P> In Astoria , Ore. , States Steamship 's freighter San Anselmo was held in port by striking longshoremen . <P> In Hilo , Hawaii , the Matson liner Matsonia left strikers on the beach , sailed with a skeleton crew . <P> In Berkeley , Calif. , longshoremen refused to unload a cargo of copra from Portland California Steamship 's freighter Admiral Nulton because they would have to pass through the picket lines of the striking Warehousemen 's Union to reach her . <P> In San Francisco the Dollar liner President Hoover was held in port by strikers , while 471 passengers fumed and $1,000,000 in mail and cargo waited , because the Line refused to rehire a 25-year-old seaman named Charles Brenner . On the voyage from Honolulu Brenner headed a group of sailors who complained that Captain George Yardley had violated sea safety laws by putting out with hatches open , booms hanging overside , four lifeboats dismantled . When the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Orient , 50 members of her deck-crew refused to sign on unless Seaman Brenner were hired also . The Line refused . After six days ' delay and $50,000 loss to the Line , the Department of Labor 's pudgy Trouble-Shooter Edward Fitzgerald persuaded Secretary Harry Lundeberg of the Sailors ' Union of the Pacific to cool off the crew so that the President Hoover might get to sea . <P> All this added up to a first-rate marine labor crisis on the West Coast which threatened to tighten rather than ease as Sept. 30 drew near . On that date expires the agreement reached after the 1934 general strike by the waterfront labor unions , notably Harry Bridges ' International Longshoremen 's Association , and the Waterfront Employers ' Association . Negotiations on a contract to replace it found both sides in a thoroughly truculent mood last week . Debates were featured by such extreme proposals from both labor and management that the shipowners finally suggested arbitration . The longshoremen agreed to poll their members on the proposal , frankly adding that they would try to instigate another general strike @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ As the referendum started on the Pacific Coast , Longshoreman Bridges set about involving the rest of the U. S. by getting I. L. A. 's National President Joseph P. Ryan to call a conference of Pacific , Gulf , Great Lakes and Atlantic longshoremen to consider united action on all coasts . <P> Meantime a highly emotional fuse was stuck in an already explosive situation with the development of a sensational waterfront murder case . For the killing of a freighter engineer in San Francisco last April , police last week arraigned four suspects , announced that one of them had confessed committing the crime on Union orders . To the defendants ' defense rushed the I. L. A. , trumpeting : ' There shall not be another . . . frame-up like the case of Mooney and Billings ! "
