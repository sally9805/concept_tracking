AFTER all , that is the keynote of Jane Addams ' life ? her passion to share . To brace her shoulders under the weight of humanity 's burdens ? to shower humanity with all the richness of her own enthusiasms , her own artistic appreciations . To accomplish this purpose she has given up life as a personal thing ? life , the most exquisitely personal of all things . She has poured into her plan a fortune that would have kept her in ease and luxury . She has left the green fields and rushing streams and fair skies and peace that were her inheritance , to live among the sights and sounds and smells and turmoil of a grimy , congested city . She has relinquished beauty ? for with the exception of Hull House and the things she has put into it , nothing in all the vicinity is lovely . Gray smoke smears the sky . Rattling trolleys clatter through the cobblestoned streets . Stark , gaunt buildings crowd closer and closer like prison walls , about the beauty spot she has made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless her friends come and work with her . It takes time to build friendships ? and Jane Addams has no time . She has given up solitude , that most precious of all refuges for the thinker and the dreamer ? and Jane Addams is a thinker , a dreamer ? for days and nights never free from interruptions , petty or tragic . And with it all she has kept her sanity and her sense of humor . Her blue eyes crinkle into laughter as she tells you of the tiny tot who said , " I always say Please ' at Hull House ? why , sometimes I even say I beg your pardon . ' " And her voice ? that infallible index to gaiety or sadness ? is cheery as a bird note , clear and musical . There is no hint of sentimentality or renunciation about Jane Addams . She translates her emotions into action ? and her renunciation is so complete that she does not even know she has renounced anything . And 3-et . . . Over the mantel in Hull House hangs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in May . I wonder how long that picture has been the only springtime Jane Addams has known . . . Two more things she has tried to give up ? but life would not let her ? a career and fame . They have come to her in spite of herself and against her will . Even now she holds them off as if they were enemies ? perhaps because she finds it difficult to share them , as she has done with all the rest . But she tries . Ask Jane Addams of herself , and she points to Hull House . " This is my work . It speaks for itself . " And yet , even without Hull House , which is the actual , tangible proof of the clarity and truth of her theories , Jane Addams would be great . Her writings , her speeches , her theories and prophecies , make her the most noteworthy woman in the field of sociology today . And her analyses of conditions in this world of today are stamped with the seal of youth and youth 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , a great preacher . And surely her quick sense of beauty , which thrilled to the magic of Rome and the Alhambra , and her ability to create the oasis of cultured hospitality and charm wh ch she has thrown open to the people of the tenements , could have been coined into commercial value . But even as a baby Jane Addams began her lifelong habit of sharing with the world . Only at that time her whole world was her father ? a Quaker ? a miller ? whose keen mind and unswerving integrity were her finest inheritance . With all her heart she longed for a flattened thumb like her father 's , and would sit for hours rubbing the ground wheat as it fell from between the millstones . And if she happened to wake at three o'clock in the morning ? as her father did for many years while he was a miller 's apprentice ? she was happy and contented , and even began a course of reading in the early hours , fired by his stories of how he had read the village @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were cast in pleasant places . Her home was at the end of an Illinois village , and across a stretch of green two mills turned busily on a cheerful little stream . She knew the trees and flowers and birds , and the glory of sunsets , and the scent of spring , and the crystal shine of stars in the winter sky . Occasionally she drove with her father to a near-by city , where her childish eyes were dazzled by the splendor of the candy shop and the marvelous toys . But one day she grew up ? when she was six , almost seven ? and she saw the city with new eyes . The tiny , little , ugly houses huddled close in shame of their shabbiness and grime , and she asked her father why people lived like this when they might have the beauty of the woods and the wide skies she loved so well . His explanation taught her for the first time what poverty and overcrowding can do to deface the beauty of life , and then and there ? baby as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spacious house , set not with others of its kind , but down amid the squalor of a city ? so that she might share the squalor ? and the house . It was years before the sight of a city 's poor came into her life as a determining  | force again ? years which were divided between her beloved home and her schools . Years which gave her a B.A. at Rockford College , Rockford , j Illinois , among the first graduating class of four in 1881 . Years which decided her to study medicine and work among the poor . Now she began a medical course in the - omen 's Medical College of Philadelphia ? but of ter two years of study a recurrence of a spinal difficulty which had shadowed her childhood forced her to lay aside this plan and spend the next six months lying in bed with only books for consolation . Travel was part of her physician 's prescription for her convalescence ? and in London , as a tourist , she again came in contact with a city 's poor ? an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blinding flash of light . On a conducted tour she was taken to the East End of London ? to the vegetable market , where on Saturdays ? at midnight ? the hideous , decaying fruits and vegetables were sold at auction to the city 's starving poor . From a bus top she witnessed it ? the gloomy street lit by yellow gas flares . Stark , white faces massed in the gloom about the hucksters ' carts . Hungry people clamoring for the wretched food . Straining their hands ? pitiful , workworn , starved hands ? for the only food life offered them . It made an indelible impression on the young girl 's mind . The brutality of life ? the tragedy of life ? the piteousness of humanity helpless to fight life . And all through Italy and France and Spain , where she found in herself an unexpected response to beauty that somehow also was her heritage ? she found herself irresistibly drawn to the poor quarters ? those bogs of wretchedness that exist , sometimes almost unsuspected , within a stone 's throw of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ memory from their mind as easily as they can close their eyes on a terrible sight . Jane Addams is not one of them . She could not forget . And in her , remembering worked a divine unrest to do something ? not to remain quiescent in the belief that things will always be as they are , but move ? to act ? to change them . This unrest troubled the two years that elapsed before her second trip to Europe . And some time during that second trip she decided upon a plan well within the reach of possibility , and which might be carried out without delay ? to rent a house in a part of the city where life was hard and people needed a great many things , and see just how useful she could be to them . She shared her plan with a friend ? Ellen Gates Starr ? whose immediate enthusiasm set the final seal upon the enterprise , and after a visit at Toynbee Hall , in London , learning all they could about fighting poverty of body and soul , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a neighborhood and a house suited to their work .  |
