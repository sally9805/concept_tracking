WE HAVE lately been getting a good deal of education in international politics , but we need still more . The proposal for a popular referendum on the declaration of war implies a growing conviction that the people themselves should make the ultimate decision of international politics ; but to make it intelligently we need to know more about the cost of war ? and about the cost of trying to remain at peace in a world at war . Alone of the great powers , we have some freedom of decision , thanks to geography . The referendum plan discriminates between two kinds of war ? attacks on our territory or that of our neighbors , which would have to be met without delay ; and wars which we can go into or stay out of as we may choose . The latter is the only kind of war this generation is likely to have to worry about . It is not seriously disputed that until the size and range of aircraft have greatly increased , no foreign power can do us much damage if we stay @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " ? Alaska , Hawaii , Panama , and so on around to Newfoundland . No dictator , however ambitious , would attempt an attack doomed to certain failure . If we go to war in the next few years it will be either in an effort to salvage our interests and prestige in the Far East ( mostly prestige , for trade with Japan is by far our largest interest ) ; or in an attempt to help the European democracies ( and Russia ) check the continuing aggression of Germany , Italy , and Japan . Nobody wants to fight if we can help it ; but as Mr. Roosevelt said in his reply to Mr. Landon , " whether we like it or not we are a part of a large world of other nations and peoples . As such we owe some measure of co-operation and even leadership in maintaining standards of conduct helpful to the ultimate goal of general peace . " And effective co-operation to restore general peace involves the risk of being drawn into a general war . But isolation has its risks too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the drawbacks of both policies , unlike most researches into this subject was not begun as an argument for either ;  | nor is it inspired by the lofty idealism that animates so much of the Americamust-choose literature , on both sides . Both co-operation and isolation have been advocated as means to the salvation of the world , or to the realization of some transcendental ideal of what humanity ought to be ; the present study is merely an attempt to figure out , from the standpoint of national interest , which is the more expensive and dangerous . On both sides idealists have underestimated the practical difficulties . Too many cooperationists talk as if we can buy world peace at a bargain sale ; too many isolationists seem to think that if we only say we are going to stay out of war everybody will live happily ever after . Unfortunately it will not be so easy as that . II The mere mechanics of isolation in a world at war are more complex than most people realize . One of many reasons why we went to war in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given us a common economic interest with England and France . Many isolationists , believing that was the only or at least the principal reason , have accordingly a simple formula for keeping out of the next war : abolish all trade with warring nations . This would require amendment of the present Neutrality Act , which , besides forbidding the export of arms and munitions to belligerents , gives the President discretion to forbid the export of almost anything else , in American ships or under American ownership . Belligerents may still buy anything except munitions , but they must take it away in their own ships ; and they can not borrow money here to pay for it ; they must bring their own . It is this last provision , rather than the cashand-carry clause , that would virtually confine our foreign trade in a world war to England and her allies . The British navy would control the Atlantic , the Japanese navy would control the Pacific ? subject in each case to interference from enemy airplanes and submarines ; but Japan , Germany , and Italy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy much . Transpacific trade would be limited to barter for as much silk as Japan could produce for export in wartime . Repeal of the cash-and-carry clause , an embargo on all trade with belligerents , would accordingly please not only the bitter-end isolationists but the people who want to see England beaten . Conversely , it would be unpopular with those who , though believing we should remain neutral , would rather see the democracies win than the Fascist powers . Here is an emotional conflict that would bring constant pressure on Congress , keep the war and the embargo an issue in domestic politics . There would be other pressures which have been underestimated by many isolationists . " Neutrality is not easy , " admits Alfred M. Bingham in Beware of Europe 's Wars , but he does not specify the difficulties . Quincy Howe , in England Expects Every American To Do His Duty , concludes that complete isolation would entail governmental control of business which might amount to state socialism ; but he skips lightly over the details , and the costs . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pamphlet is a very able analysis of the present crisis , whereas Howe 's book is described on its jacket , with perhaps unintended candor , as " assuming no special knowledge on the part of the reader . " With very little knowledge , one can see that Howe 's Anglophobia throws his whole world picture out of focus . Others ? Kirby Page and Mauritz A. Hallgren , for instance ? have been more candid . An embargo , says Hallgren , would mean " an economic depression far more devastating than that which began in 1929 , " particularly ruinous to agriculture . To keep the national economy going at all would require some sort of dictatorship ? perhaps quasi-socialist , more likely a native brand of Fascism . Emotional opposition to the embargo would be reinforced by the population of the areas ruined by the embargo ; repeal  | would be demanded not by bankers and munition makers ? not out in front anyway ? but by farmers of the corn and cotton States to whom Congress seldom says No . These considerations were apparent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Planning Association ( ESPA for short ) the most careful study yet attempted of the mechanics and the domestic consequences of isolation . They dismiss the idea of an embargo except on munitions very curtly . Nearly two million people are dependent on export to Europe alone ; some of our crops , many of our industries , count on the foreign market for their margin of profit ; an embargo would be so costly that " numerous and powerful groups would prefer war . " A trade policy designed to keep us at peace , says the committee , must have three objectives ? to prevent such a shrinkage of trade as would cause a domestic crisis ; to escape dependence on war trade for prosperity , as in 1916 ; and to forestall an expansion that would intensify the inevitable post-war slump . So it recommends continuance of trade with everybody ; but on the cash-and-carry basis , and with exports to any belligerent limited to its normal peacetime quota . Except for farm products ; they could be exported in much greater quantity ? otherwise a Congress respectful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ restrictions at all . This could go on as long as belligerents could pay for it . Several billion dollars ' worth of American securities owned abroad ( mostly by the British and their probable allies ) could be liquidated , but gradually , so as to prevent a break in market values and too rapid a growth of war trade . Thus while a war boom could not be wholly eliminated , it could be spread out thin , taken a little at a time instead of in one indigestible lump . But it would mean control over exports and stock markets such as we have never known in peacetime , with endless possibilities of evasion and graft . Other neutrals , mostly in the Americas , would turn to us for goods they used to buy from belligerents ; the surplus sent to them might be re-exported to belligerents . Each warring coalition would be suspicious of our increased Latin-American trade ; submarines in both seas might interfere with it . ( Also , as Senator Borah has suggested , submarines lying outside our ports to sink belligerent merchantmen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Thus at great expense and inconvenience we could escape some of the risks of involvement , but not all . Trade means import as well as export ; even we are not quite self-sufficient , but luckily our biggest imports , coffee and sugar , come from the Americas . The breakfast table could carry on as usual ; Japanese silk would gradually become scarcer and more expensive , but the girls would not have to take to cotton stockings at once unless they chose . Rubber and some of the minor metals would be the worst problem ; the committee recommends that we start laying in a reserve of these before war begins . In a few years Brazilian rubber will again amount to something ; if the war breaks out before then Japanese cruisers could shut off imports from Malaysia and the Dutch East Indies ; pleasure cars might gradually disappear from our roads . There would be immense internal strains and dislocations ; Latin-American trade could not take care of all our merchant marine ; many seamen would be unemployed ? and plenty of other people too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; prices and raw materials would soon have to be controlled . The whole scheme implies a government control of business which , the committee concedes , might mean " a permanent change in our economic system . " But it would be far less rigorous than the centralization needed to enforce an embargo ; still less than the regimentation that would almost certainly be imposed on us if we went into the war . It seems to me that some such plan is our best chance of staying out of a world  | war and at the same time keeping the United States a going concern . But it would not be enough for the root-andbranch isolationists or for the people who hate England ; it would be too much for many others . Those who would lose money or the hope of making money through such measures would contrast them ( says the committee ) not with the only alternative ? the much more stringent regulations that war would bring ? but with happy memories of peace and normalcy . Unless public opinion were overwhelmingly behind the policy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as was the Volstead Act . If it were effectively enforced there would be a festering resentment among all the people whom it inconvenienced ; which would ally itself with more disinterested resentments . It was not merely economic reasons that got us into the last war ; most Americans hoped that England , France , and their allies would win . Most Americans would hope so next time ; we could not be neutral in thought any more than we could after the invasion of Belgium in 1914 . Bingham , with the logic of his convictions , suggests that " perhaps the floods of foreign propaganda should be curbed . " But a new Alien Act to silence foreign propagandists would have to be supplemented by a new Sedition Act to shut up their American sympathizers ; the " co-operative commonwealth established in democracy " of which Bingham dreams would be built on the grave of the Bill of Rights . The ESPA committee drily remarks that such suppression would be neither constitutional , desirable , nor feasible ; the best we can do is to counter war propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it would have a better chance of success than any other . But life in the United States under such regulations would be uncomfortable and uncertain , both materially and psychologically ; we might look back to the winter of 1937 ? 8 as a vanished Golden Age of prosperity and happiness . III The effect of American isolation on the rest of the world may seem irrelevant to this inquiry ; but it backfires on our national interests , as the more intelligent isolationists realize . So they try to show that by remaining neutral we serve others as well as ourselves . " The only effective discouragement we can offer to powerful belligerents , " says Bingham , " is the assurance that under no circumstances will we trade with any belligerent . " But this would not discourage Germany , Italy , and Japan ; they take only one-sixth of our exports , and could get very little of that in wartime even if we had no restrictions on trade . It would unquestionably discourage England and France , but they do not want to fight anyway @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ point of the isolationist case . By refusing to co-operate now with the peaceful powers we make a world war more probable ; if that war comes , American isolation will make a Fascist victory more probable . Almost all our isolationists prefer democracy to Fascism ; but the isolationist arguments of the liberal Howe , the radical Bingham . are echoed ( rather more forcefully ) by the Fascist Lawrence Dennis . So even Quincy Howe 's conscience is a little uneasy . At one moment he rejoices in the prospective removal of " England 's dead hand " from the earth , at the chance for other nations to find their places in the sun . But when he sees what they do with sunshine when they get it , he argues that Italy and Germany could not win a major war , must collapse in revolution if they even try it , etc . Bingham is not so sure ; but he reasons from the French failure to keep Germany down that Hitler could not permanently enslave England and France , and he does not care much who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lead to Communist revolutions everywhere , no matter who wins . But ( aside from the fact that Russia might again be the first to cave in ) history offers few instances of successful revolutions against victorious governments ;  | and even in the beaten countries there is no evident reason why Communism must come to the top . More probably , if the Fascists won , the eventual governments of the defeated democracies would be cliques of Fascist stooges , as in the occupied provinces of China to-day . Men who would serve the conqueror would be harder to find in France and England than in China , but they could be found ; the French found such men in the Rhineland in 1919 . All this is guesswork , but some guesses are more plausible than others . Economically , everybody would be worse off after a world war no matter who won it , neutrals as well as belligerents ; but politically , a victory for the democracies would suit us well enough . No doubt they would hate us for not helping them win more cheaply . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereof ; because they came not to the help of the Lord , to the help of the Lord against the mighty . " But we came to the help of the Lord against the mighty in 1917 , and got cursed out just the same after it was over . In any case , British and French bitterness would go no farther than talk . But suppose the Fascists won ? reduced England and France to impotence , divided up the British , French , and Dutch colonial empires , dominated Scandinavia and the Balkans . They might have as much as they could manage for the moment but not as much as they want ; it is in the logic of Fascist doctrine ( convincingly analyzed by E. B. Ashton in The Fascist : His State and His Mind ) that the more the State has the more it must demand , so " its growth knows no saturation point . " After Europe , the next field for Fascist expansion is Latin America ; so if we do not help to stop it in Europe and Asia we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I believe this fear is exaggerated . No single Fascist power is strong enough now to attack the Americas ; none of them will be any stronger for years after the next war , even if it wins it . Nor could they easily combine against us ; the essence of the Fascist creed is national egoism . The present Fascist quasi-alliance works well enough toward immediate and limited objectives ; but once European influence was excluded from eastern Asia , Japan would play a lone hand . And the overthrow of England and France would only clear the way for a German-Italian war as soon as Germany and Italy had recovered enough to fight again . Their clashing interests on the Danube and in the Alps are far more vital than either 's interest in Latin America . The greater danger would be indirect . Fascist victory would immensely enhance the prestige of Fascism as a creed ? already popular with some Latin-American dictators as a new name for an old practice . But the biggest and most nearly Fascist of the lot , President Vargas of Brazil , dislikes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us to any leaning toward Fascists overseas . And we are well insulated ; the Panama Canal is flanked by democratic countries , and the collectivism of Mexico is a collectivism of the Left , not of the Right . Here at home victorious Fascism would win the admiration of more and more American business men ; but they might begin to realize by that time that in Germany and Italy the rich , no less than the poor , are slaves of the state ? house servants rather than field hands , but slaves none the less . Another danger ? there is already a sort of clerical Fascism in Quebec ; and American Catholics have supported Spanish Fascism so zealously that a good many liberals are afraid they might support Fascism here . The Knights of Columbus ' crusade against " Communism " certainly interprets Communism very liberally ; but authoritative American Catholic voices ? Cardinal Mundelein 's , for instance ? have denounced Fascism , and in Europe the Church has been selective in its support . In Spain and Austria , where it has always upheld authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerned with its own authority . Somebody else has the authority in Germany , somebody else would have it here .  | For any American Fascism would probably depend for its popular appeal on something like the Ku Klux movement ; if it had a religious color , that color would be Protestant ? as farseeing Catholics must realize . All in all , it does not look as if a Fascist victory would necessarily mean a Fascist America ; if this country ever goes Fascist it will be on account of what happens here , not overseas . We may be only postponing the danger till our grandchildren 's time ; no one can say what they may have to face if Japan dominates and organizes Asia , if Germany and Italy can keep from eating each other up . But the danger is neither so great nor so immediate as is usually represented . Other consequences of a world war would be costly to us as well as disastrous to the belligerents ; but here too there has been exaggeration . It is commonly said that the next world @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to have quite enough power , yet , to wipe out all its achievements . Air fleets are far larger and more powerful than twenty years ago ; but their failure to destroy ? however badly they have damaged ? the flimsily built cities of China suggests that the pictures of London , Paris , and Berlin wiped off the map are premature . They could be badly battered , but not yet obliterated . Urban life in Europe is more dependent on technology than in China ; the worst results of air attack would not be the material destruction but panic , hunger , epidemic . But every European government is training its people in " passive defense , " working out emergency plans for evacuation and food supply ; preparing for a return to cave life till the bombers have stopped coming . Irreplaceable treasures will be destroyed in the next war , Europe will be left frightfully weakened and impoverished ; but the total material collapse of civilization is not to be expected this time . Spiritually and morally , civilization collapsed on August 1 , 1914 ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a culture which with all its shortcomings did give more satisfaction to more people than any other yet evolved . Young people can not realize how the world has been coarsened and barbarized since 1914 ; they may feel the loss of the security into which their parents were born but they can not appreciate how much else has been lost : even we who once had it can not recall it now without an effort . But the collapse of a great culture is a long process ; it tool : the Roman world four or five centuries to hit bottom . Since 1914 we have slipped back as far perhaps as the Romans slipped between the Antonine age and the days of Alexander Severus . It is a long way ; but the Rome of Alexander would have looked like paradise to the Romans who lived under Constantine ? and still they kept on slipping . So may we . The next war might shock the human race back into sanity ; it is more likely to leave all nations coarsened and barbarized still further , with more wars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ end war and liberate oppressed nationalities ; it only led to a new war , the defeated powers combining with those of the victorious coalition who had been shortchanged at the peace conference ; and that led to another war , and another , until the qualities that had made the Greeks great completely disappeared . What has all that to do with us ? Well , some of our isolationists talk as if by mere staying out of war we can make this country an Island of the Blest . Quincy Howe sings a paean to self-sufficient America , which will " promote western civilization in the one country where it has not actually gone into a decline . " Europe will be no loss ; " the civilization of Europe in general and of Britain in particular proclaims itself doomed " ( by the mouths of Bertrand Russell , Andre Gide , Aldous Huxley ) and anyway " if England sank into the sea America would still have the Bible and Shakespeare , the world would still be indebted to Newton and Darwin . " So the eastern Roman @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Western world had relapsed into barbarism ; but those who talk  | of America as " the new Byzantium , " keeping the torch of civilization alight through the next Dark Age , forget that the Byzantine culture was intellectually very arid . It imitated the classics , badly ; it preserved and annotated them , in evernarrowing selection ; it was the best there was at the time , and we owe it an enormous debt ; but it is nothing for us to emulate if we can help it . An impoverished and barbarized Europe means an America impoverished , though in less degree , by the loss of the European market ; an America barbarized , though in less degree , by the loss of contact and interaction with a still vital European culture . We have already a dangerous tendency to self-admiration . So has every great nation , but at present they are a check on one another 's complacency ; without a rival , we should admire ourselves more and more , perhaps with less and less reason . There is something in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without which humanity would be the poorer . There was once something like that in the German character ; it has been destroyed in Germany by forces whose conquest of Europe would be made easier by American isolation . Civilization to-day is probably at its best in Scandinavia , Holland , Switzerland ; there is not much doubt what will become of those countries if Hitler goes on unchecked . Quincy Howe might be pleased if Oxford and Cambridge were brought low , but even he would hardly like to see " Nazi science " taught at Leyden and Upsala . Some of these evils would follow any world war , but not all . People who say our isolation would do Europe any good are only poulticing their consciences . It may make sense for us , but there is no altruism about it . IV Co-operation to restore general peace would prevent all that . But a good many co-operationists seem to think we can scare off the enemy with a shout , as Achilles once did , or at most by economic pressure . " Economic and financial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " if they are honestly applied . " Can not is a large word ; so is if , in that context . Against Italy , sanctions failed ; they were not honestly applied , but the reasons why they were not would operate next time too . That failure discredited the word " sanctions , " but not the idea . What Mr. Roosevelt meant by " quarantine " has not , at this writing , been authoritatively declared ; but New York Times editorials on November 30th and December 24th last advocated a policy which could be described by that term , though it carefully was not . The Times insisted that this was a formal policy of sanctions , but that concurrent independent action on parallel lines by the United States , the British Empire , and perhaps France and the Netherlands , would achieve the same result as co-operation . " Great sums of money are required for armies invading foreign soil . . . . Certain raw materials are essential to the conduct of wars , and they are to be found chiefly in democratic territories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ materials , acting independently but in parallel , can properly withhold them . " Thus would fall " the sure shadow of economic starvation on spendthrift governments which can not wage war unless we supply them . " If by this plan we could restore general peace nobody would care much what we called it . But resort to such measures after the failure of diplomacy to check the aggressors would be a continuation of politics by other means : which is the classic definition of war . This is war ? a limited inexpensive method of war , in which our side has the advantage . If it proves effective , aggressor governments have a choice between abandoning the objectives which they have persuaded their people are vitally necessary , and resorting to other methods of war in which they would have a better chance of success . In 1935 Mussolini said he would fight if sanctions inconvenienced him , and sanc- tions were not permitted to inconvenience him . This has not been forgotten in Berlin and Tokyo . Economic starvation is not a substitute for war ; it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other and bloodier campaigns . If it were applied to Japan , the reply might be a Japanese attack on Hong Kong or the Philippines , or French Indo-China , or the Dutch East Indies . Stern realists face this prospect undismayed . " The Western powers , " says Raymond Leslie Buell , " could refrain from taking any military action to defend their possessions in the Orient , realizing that if they applied the embargo long enough Japan would have to withdraw . " How long is long enough ? Longer , I suspect , than Occidental patience would endure . The real estate listed above does not belong to Mr. Buell . Its actual owners , notably the French , have shown no enthusiasm for this policy of " temporary " abandonment when it has been brought into unofficial conversation . If we have learned anything in these past few months it ought to be that cooperation entails the risk of war , even if you call it concurrent parallelism . Some attempt should be made , then , to estimate the cost of war , compare it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it did twenty years ago and war would be no exception . Our strength again might tip the balance ; but this time Germany has stronger allies , so that the war might be longer if the peoples of the world could endure it ; the cost might be heavier ? in lives , in money , in social and spiritual dislocations . And the profit of victory ? A lasting peace , a sane international organization , a world made safe for democracy ? Just what we hoped to get when we went to war in 1917 ; it is doubtful if we have a much better chance of getting it next time . Possibly of course the whole world will have learned a lesson ? if the war is short and victory cheap . The longer it lasts the worse will be every human being who survives it ? with judgment warped , emotions inflamed . Wilson said , at the end of the last war , that we must be just even to those to whom we did not want to be just ; but his motion was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been too long and costly , the danger of defeat too recently imminent . The same conditions repeated would probably produce the same state of mind . Wilson laid down his Fourteen Points when we were already deep in the War ; he might have laid down conditions before we went in . But in 1915 the Italians laid down conditions before they went in , and got them written into a solemn contract ; yet they did not get what had been promised when the plunder was divided . Europe would be even worse off to-day if they had got it , but the precedent is not encouraging . If we fight for British and French democracy we also defend the British and French empires ; co-operation with the peoples means co-operation with their governments . The present British government is an excellent argument for American isolation . Its foreign policy for the past seven years has been an almost unbroken series of blunders . It proved its unscrupulousness by the way it got rid of King Edward ( he had to be got rid of , but the methods @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Manchurian affair ; and proved both when rebellion broke out in Spain . A government that hazards its own imperial interests to protect class interests , and fails to protect either , would be no safe partner in war or in the making of peace . Somebody else might be in power at the end of the war ? Nobody much better . British Labor would make a better peace than the present ruling group , but popular parties displace conservative governments in wartime only after some such disaster as Sedan . Wilson in 1914 thought England was sated with territory and would want no more if she won ; he learned otherwise in 1919 . We hear much from London about the " weary Titan " sagging under the burden of empire , but no doubt the wheezy old gentleman could add Libya and Ethiopia to his  | load if the chance were offered . So with the French . A government headed by such a man as Leon Blum would probably make a decent peace ; but men like Leon Blum are not in power at the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like Clemenceau . V So it does not seem much more likely that victory would bring us what we were fighting for than it did last time ? a little perhaps , but not much . And to the familiar costs of war one more would be added ; we should have to sign away our liberties while the war lasted , and we might never get them back . To win a great war requires a concentration of national effort , and that means a concentration of power which may approximate a dictatorship . We had a taste of such concentration in 1918 ; but in that year , when this country came nearer to hitting on all cylinders than at any other time in its history , the co-operation was mostly voluntary . Most Americans believed in the objectives of the war and were willing to work their hardest to attain them . After the disillusionment that followed , there might be less enthusiasm next time ; but there will be far more concentration if the Industrial Mobilization Plan worked out by the War and Navy Departments is put @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ passed but they might be jammed through Congress in the excitement of the beginning of war . This plan is the strongest of all arguments for isolation . It gives the President control of business , industry , finance , labor ? control far more drastic than we have ever known . He may fix wages and prices , regulate production , take over private property ; censor the press ( indirectly but effectively ) , suspend enumerated laws if he chooses . He can further draft as many men as he sees fit ? leaving them at work in factories if they are more useful there , but sending them to the trenches if they strike or even complain , however justifiably . The national Administrator of Labor is to be " an outstanding industrial leader " ; labor leaders are only permitted to give advice which need not be taken . And conscription continues till six months after the President has decided that the emergency is over . Times will be unsettled after the next war ; a President who thought he could get away with it could find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ With this plan in effect it would be ridiculous to pretend that we were fighting for democracy ; for this is Fascism in spirit , if not in form and structure ? with the difference that the rich in America would be far better off than they are in Germany and Italy to-day . One of the purposes of the studies that produced this plan was to take the profit out of war , but the Army soon discovered that without profit , and satisfactory profit , there would be no deliveries . Some army contracts fix the profit at six per cent ; but ambiguities in cost accounting would make it actually much higher . As counsel for the Pittsburgh Ordnance District candidly put it , " profit at the rate of six per cent would not tempt successful industrial companies " to help their country win the war ; but at ten per cent , he thought , their patriotism might begin to function . There has been talk of drafting capital as you draft men ; but if you commandeered factories whose owners held out for too high @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them efficiently . In most cases these would be the very men who had gone on strike against serving their country for a beggarly six per cent . An Administration which had the courage to shoot a few corporation presidents might get some action ; but we are hardly likely to see that . The Army officers who drew up the plan reasoned from the experience of 1917 ? 18 that you can draft men to fight , you can probably draft them to work at fixed wages ; but you can not draft the management of industry to work for less than it considers a satisfactory profit . As individuals , the members of this class average as high in patriotism as anybody  | else . If they are of military age they go to war , usually as volunteers ; if over age they send their sons , and experience the same emotions as other men if those sons are killed ; they serve the government as dollar-a-year men , and by no means all of them use their official positions to advance their private interests . But when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a class , they hold out for all they can get . The Industrial Mobilization Plan makes them preferred stockholders in the nation at war ; what else they might become depends on who might be President at the time . Under some Presidents we have had , and under some presidential possibilities , this war dictatorship would be turned into a plutocratic class dictatorship which could hardly be thrown off by peaceful means . This is such a probable effect of the plan that one can not help wondering if it were the intention , if wartimes efficiency is only a pretext ; but so far as I can find out in Washington , this is not so at all . The capitalists of the Army Ordnance Association may have given the scheme their approval , but it seems to have sprung from the brains of Army officers dazzled by Clausewitz 's concept of " absolute war . " Begun as a means to an end , such a war becomes an end in itself , to which the life of the nation is only a means . If we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be necessary ; we could afford to sacrifice even democracy if we were fighting for national existence . But it seems out of all proportion to any war in which we are likely to be engaged . The General Staff plans for an army of four million men next time ; some enthusiasts talk of even more . But what could we do with four million men in a war with Japan ? A few divisions could hold the disputed islands , and the decision would have to be won by the fleet and the air force . Whether mass armies will be of much use hereafter even in Europe has been seriously questioned ; and if they will , it is far from certain that we could again ship two million men overseas , with airplanes and submarines so much more effective than in 1918 . Perhaps then we could win without such drastic measures . That is a technical question but it involves the technics of politics and mass psychology as well as of military organization . It badly needs to be explored while there is yet time ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything but only to find out what is what ; for a war fought under the present plan would cost more than it was worth , even if our generals and admirals won victories as brilliant as Napoleon 's and Nelson 's . War will mean regimentation whether we go in or stay out ; it might not amount to dictatorship but it will look like dictatorship by contrast with peacetime , especially to those whom it restrains . Control to preserve neutrality would restrain rugged individualists who wanted to make money out of war trade regardless of the consequences ; no conservative Administration could bring itself to such interference with business . Norman Thomas 's program ( and Bingham 's , and Kirby Page 's ) is " neutrality plus Socialism . " It probably would not go that far , and certainly would not be called Socialism ; but it seems pretty clear that only a moderately radical Administration could preserve neutrality against the combined attack of conservatives and Communists . As between embargo and the program of the ESPA committee , the latter ( besides being much more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be less dictatorial . The regimentation planned for wartime , however innocently intended , would drift toward a dictatorship by big business . The trend could be resisted only by a radical President strong enough and popular enough to make the wartime dictatorship something like a personal autocracy . None of these prospects is pleasant , yet one of them is likely to become a reality in the next world war . Everybody will lose the next war ? victors as well as vanquished , neutrals as well as belligerents ; we are going to lose it whether  | we go in or stay out . I believe we shall lose it less disastrously if we stay out . By going in ( and winning ) we could make the outcome somewhat less calamitous for the world ; but for our own interests , isolation is likely to be less costly than victory . Call this crass selfishness if you like ; but would any other nation , situated as we are , even dream of sticking out its chin in an attempt to save the world ? The European @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they want us to co-operate because we might save them ; but everywhere the people will tell you , " You Americans are lucky . If we too were three thousand miles away ? " This conclusion may derive some value from the fact that I did not reach it before I started and then set out to prove it ; my emotional inclinations are all the other way . My grandfather had to leave Germany after 1848 , and he would not like Hitler any better than he liked the King of Prussia . I have many friends in Europe ; I have lived long enough in England to have an affection for the English people , despite their present government ; I am particularly fond of the Dutch and the Czechs , who will be right out in front when trouble comes . But as a choice between evils ? which is all we have ? it seems to me that the lesser evil for us is to keep out if we can . Twenty years ago we went on a crusade which would have made sense if we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find the Holy Grail , and the experience ought to have cured us of our inclination to go grailing . VI But is the war inevitable ? Ca n't we do something to prevent it ? God knows ; to less inclusive intelligences the answer is not apparent . Norman Thomas finds the only hope of lasting peace in " a new social and international order , " Mrs. Roosevelt in " a fundamental change in human nature . " Different words for the same thing ; it would save us no doubt if it happened , but do n't expect it to happen this week . Secretary Hull 's policy of trying to improve international trade , and international good will with it , seems the most hopeful ( or least hopeless ) of practical programs . Gradually , with the hearty support of the Dutch and Scandinavians , and now at last with the co-operation of the British , he is trying to build up a group of likeminded nations respecting one another , getting along together , reciprocally improving their standard of living , setting a good example @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this group of nations is no exclusive lodge , but a union that anybody can join who is willing to behave himself and pay the dues . There is no reason why Germany or Italy or Japan can not join it ? except that they show no inclination to behave themselves and pay the dues ; their leaders have taught them to believe they need more than peaceful co-operation would give them . If their complaints are genuine , if lack of colonies , of raw materials , of markets in a tariff-ridden world is the impulse behind their aggressions , can not we satisfy them peaceably ? Many who are isolationists so far as war is concerned would be willing to co-operate in an endeavor to remove the causes of war . There are Englishmen who would like to buy off Hitler at the expense of small nations and there are Americans who would like to buy him off at the expense of England . But there are plenty of others ? you can find them even on Capitol Hill ? who would be willing for America to make a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to Germany ; but if there were a world conference for economic appeasement we could make a contribution by lowering our tariffs , opening our markets to foreign goods , enabling Germany , Italy , and Japan to make an honest living instead of racketeering . This would injure some of our own industries ; but their owners could be compensated by the government , their workers could be given government work ( something better than most WPA projects ) till other industry  | reabsorbed them . It would cost a good deal , but far less than war ; far less even than isolation in a world at war . This makes sense on the hypothesis that the problem of the so-called " havenot nations " is basically economic . Perhaps it was once ; fifteen years ago this plan might have worked . But Fascism , Nazism , even if they became popular as pain-killers in hard times , have now become religions , ends in themselves . With ordinary governments , more or less responsive to the needs of their constituents , you can come to terms . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreement , except temporarily as a matter of tactics ; its paramount needs to which it has forced the individual to submit can not be subordinated in turn to foreign interests . So says Ashton anyway ; and with plentiful corroboration . " In Germany , " says the Reich Press Chief , " the individual does not exist ; he is only an aspect of the State . " And a Japanese statesman tells the Germans that they and the Japanese alike are " animated by the ideal of the Moral State . " No concessions that might make individuals more comfortable could satisfy governments that think like that . The drive behind German , Italian , Japanese expansion is more than an empty stomach ; it is a religion , and religions are not open to debate . The famous " Tanaka memorial " purporting to set forth the Japanese program for the mastery of Asia and eventual hegemony of the world has been denounced as a Chinese forgery . Literally , it probably is ; but recent Japanese policy has followed the general line of that document ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it is based is Japanese . Hitler makes tactical retreats and concessions , but there is no evidence that he has abandoned the ambitions set forth in Mein Kampf , ambitions motivated less by economic needs than by faith in the manifest destiny of the German people . And besides these reasons for doubting the efficacy of " economic appeasement , " much of Europe 's present industrial activity depends on armament programs . When the last division is equipped , the last arsenal full , will they shut down the factories and turn the workers out into the street : This is a discussion of probabilities , for no one can speak of certainties ; an attempt at reasoned analysis which necessarily omits the irrational and the incalculable . In such matters emotion , not reason , usually decides . For instance , it has been remarked that the unpaid war debts , though far from the best argument for isolation , are the argument that is politically the most effective . If war breaks out some emotional issue , as yet unforeseen , may throw logic out of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so easily stampeded as forty years ago ; but war does queer things to the emotions , especially mass emotions , and everything may look different when the bombs start dropping . We may go in , we may stay out ; or , an expert in such matters has suggested , we may do neither . The world to-day is full of war that is not called war , of so-called peace that is only partial peace . So it may be with us when everybody is fighting . Trying to defend , no longer " neutral rights " but our territorial waters , our Latin-American trade , we may find ourselves fighting an undeclared , unofficial , localized war against either coalition or both . We fought such a war against France in 1798 , and our warships had fought English warships long before we declared war in 1812 . All that is in the field of the incalculable . What does seem fairly plain is that we ought to prepare while there is time for all eventualities . We ought to draw up a Neutrality Mobilization Plan ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be ready if we want to use it ; and in case we should decide to go in , we ought to find out beforehand if the Army 's plan for war centralization is really needed for any war we are likely to have to fight . It would do us little good to win victories overseas if we lost everything we were fighting for here at home .  |
