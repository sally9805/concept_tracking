MEDICAL care , like nearly everything else in the world to-day , is suffering from acute unrest . Something is happening to that beloved figure , " the family doctor , " with which we have all been familiar in fact and in fiction . Whether he is actually disappearing or not is a debated question , but there is no doubt that for millions of Americans he is increasingly hard to find . The ordinary man relies on doctors as he probably never did before . He respects their knowledge and is a little afraid of them . He is impressed , if not actually appalled , by the growing complexity of their apparatus and by the number of doctors and the amount of machinery it often takes to locate the cause of his particular ache . But he is less sure than were his father and grandfather where to turn to get the best medical care available in his generation and location , and he is increasingly fearful that if he does get it he will either have to accept it as charity or pay for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one with which readers of HARPER 'S MAGAZINE are familiar . Most of us know about it from hard experience . Let us examine briefly some of the facts that bear upon it and then consider whether there is not , after all , a way out . Our principal source of information will be the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care , a privately organized and financed group of physicians and laymen which is now , under the chairmanship of Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur , Secretary of the Interior , completing the fourth year of a five-year study of this problem . Our conclusions , however , will be our own , since the Committee is waiting until all its facts are in before it makes up its collective mind . The criticisms of medical services in the United States may be summed up under four heads : ( 1 ) they cost too much ; ( 2 ) increasing and to a large extent unregulated specialization not only adds to this cost but makes all-round medical care difficult to obtain ; ( 3 ) adequate medical facilities are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the rural districts ; and ( 4 ) not enough emphasis is placed upon preventive medicine . We may as well dispose at once of the notion that the nation 's medical bill , as a whole , is more than the nation , as a whole , can afford . It amounts , roughly , to between three and one-half and four per cent of the total national income , or about $3,000,000 , - 000 a year . This is about $25 a year for each individual and about $100 a year for the average family . It is about what we annually pay for passenger automobiles , or for gasoline , or , if the Association against the Prohibition Amendment is accurately informed , for illicit beverages . But it is distributed with cruel unevenness . I have on my desk the answers of fourteen families out of some thousands who filled out a recent questionnaire regarding expenses for sickness . These families spent sums , in a single year , ranging from $5.02 to $2,180.03 . One family with an annual income of $3,000 incurred total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this extent , that any family in the United States which pays for its medical services may be lucky enough to get through the year on $5.02 spent for health , or it may be unlucky enough to run up bills of $2,000 or more . One may escape with a cold or two , or one may suddenly find that the doctor , surgeon , trained nurse , laboratory worker , and hospital have become , at whatever price , necessities of life . No advance information is available . Do the medical profession and its allies profiteer at our expense ? Sometimes , for every profession has its profiteers . Not in the mass , for it can be shown that the average doctor , surgeon , nurse , and medical technician are not making more than a fair living for what each knows and does ; and as for hospitals , the majority of them do not even pay expenses out of receipts from patients . The cost of medical care in hospitals is often confused with the cost of luxuries which have little or nothing to do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and private nurses sometimes come under the head of conspicuous waste . Consider the physician . He has probably spent the equivalent of $10 , - 000 or more on his education and equipment and , with 40 cents out of every dollar he takes in going for professional expenses , earns an average net income of $5,000 a year or less . The high-pressure salesman who sells us things we do not need and do not really want would despise the rewards of this man whose goods are life and health . If we leave out the relatively few practitioners who earn a very large return because they are worth it or because they " can get away with it , " the American doctor is underpaid . He gives ten years of life to getting an education and working up a practice ; he gives time regularly to patients who ca n't or wo n't pay , as well as to those who arc , or think they arc , entitled to bargain rates , and he spends excessively long hours at his dreadfully responsible job . The average @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Committee on the Costs of Medical Care revealed , puts in sixty-four hours a week ; in Detroit , according to the same authority , the average for a similar group was sixty-one hours a week . And union labor ? more power to it ? is talking of the six-hour day and the five-day week ! So we have a medical situation in which the average physician invests heavily and works hard for a modest return ; in which the average patient is menaced by medical charges which may ruin him or force him to resort to public charity ; and in which the actual practice of curative and preventive medicine is far behind our accumulated scientific knowledge . Malaria bobs up with its million cases every year : it can be prevented . In a single year more than 80,000 persons die of tuberculosis and several times as many are ill with it : most of these cases could have been prevented . We have each year between 30,000 and 100,000 cases of smallpox , we have had 26,000 cases and 5,700 deaths from typhoid fever , 89,000 cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : this illness and these deaths were absolutely unnecessary . Our death rate in childbirth is one of the worst in the world ; by the same token we could save the lives of thousands of mothers each year . Medicine costs too much , its rewards to those who follow it are too small , and it does not achieve all that it ought to . No wonder it has occurred to many observers who are neither revolutionaries nor alarmists that it is time something was done to remedy this situation . The proposed remedies are numerous . Some of them are good and some of them are bad , and it is not always easy to tell which is which . But I think few informed persons , lay or medical , will question the statement that the existing difficulties are due largely to defective organization or to a lack of organization in medical care . The hopeful element in this crisis is that certain tendencies toward a better organization are already showing themselves . Let us see what these tendencies are . Then let us speculate as to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medicine have , of course , gone hand in hand since the earliest times . The relation between the patient and the physician who is responsible for his care must be an individualistic one under any system of medicine , since no two patients are precisely alike . But , as the venerable oath of Hippocrates shows , there has always been a community of interest and purpose among doctors , based on a recognition of the fact that the doctor is not an ordinary merchant selling an ordinary commodity . In some degree the priestly character and the priestly responsibility still cling to him . He is by his vocation a member of a group set apart from ordinary men . He has a group code and a group psychology . His conduct is subject to the censorship of his professional brethren . In this sense all medicine is " group medicine . " Formal organization has long existed in medicine through the activities of the state and through those of private charity . The Federal , State , and local governments are the largest single agencies in the prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and men of the army and navy , and of veterans of those services , together with the Indians , are considered as wards of the government ; some diseases , such as leprosy , contagious sickness of various kinds , tuberculosis , and insanity are held to be society 's business quite as much as they are the individual 's ; and it is an accepted principle that just as no one in a civilized community can be allowed to die of starvation , so no individual , regardless of his ability to pay for it , should be denied medical care . This last principle is an elastic one . It means that in the final analysis the state must do what voluntary agencies do not . It means that those who oppose the extension of state medicine must limit its field , not by argument but by building voluntary agencies to make further intervention by the state unnecessary . In 1928 Federal , State , and local governments controlled 567,000 out of 892,000 registered hospital beds in the United States , including about ninety-five per cent of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of those for the treatment of tuberculosis . An inquiry made in 1926 showed that out of 820 graduates from American medical schools in two selected years , 1915 and 1920 , 17:3 were holding full-time governmental jobs . More than one-fourth of these graduates were in the various national or local health services . Others were in the army or navy , the Veterans ' Bureau or public school medical systems . Another 195 were doing part-time work in the same fields . In many cases these were undoubtedly young physicians gaining an experience which would later be useful to them in private practice . But , at least temporarily , they were working for the government and receiving their pay out of tax funds . 7 Government medicine arose out of the necessity of preventing the spread of disease . Its earliest form was quarantine . Organized medicine as we now have it in hospitals and clinics was a product of charity . Not until very recent times did any person who could afford a private physician go to a hospital . The increase in the number and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their equipment , and their rise in public esteem are developments of our own day . Of the 6,852 registered American hospitals in 1928 , according to Dr. C. Rufus Rorem of the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care , all but 661 were established after 1875 , and all but 2,070 since 1900 . This is an age of hospitalization . And hospitalization is about as different from medical care as practiced by the family doctor as any system dependent on . the same science and the same code could well be . It is , in effect , a co-operative practice of medicine , even though an effort is made to retain the personal relation between the individual patient and the individual doctor . The modern hospital would fit easily into a system of group practice , with insurance , periodic examinations , and organized preventive measures , but it is not ordinarily so conducted . The hospital is part of an uncompleted equation . The other half of the equation is still in an experimental form ; that is , the mass of prospective patients ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect themselves against disease and to ensure themselves adequate care when they do become ill . But there are signs that this will not always be true . From the patient 's point of view , obviously , the outstanding difficulty in obtaining adequate medical care is its cost , and not its average cost but its possible cost to him in particular . For him the objective is , as the Committee on the Costof Medical Care has defined it , " the delivery of adequate , scientific medical service to all the people , rich and poor , at a cost which can be reasonably met by them in their respective stations in life . " But it seems doubtful to many observers that this objective can be achieved without determining the average cost of medical service in advance , and then spreading this cost over a sufficiently large group according to established actuarial principles . This idea is not new . It is , however , not easy to apply , and in some of its forms it meets with opposition from the medical profession . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instances has so been abused and commercialized . In such illustration as I shall give I shall confine myself to the insurance of medical service ; since health insurance which pays only money benefits has little direct bearing on the costs of adequate medical care . The money benefit is as likely to be spent on rent and groceries as it is on physicians and medicines . Commercial health insurance sometimes provides a cash payment and also takes care of doctors ' and hospital hills within certain limits . It is always sold in connection with accident or life insurance . It has been subject to abuse , particularly on the part of malingering patients who sometimes insure in so many companies that they find it cheaper to be sick than to be well , and it can not yet be called a great success . Some life insurance companies have found it profitable to give their policy holders free medical examinations at regular periods ; and at least one industrial life insurance company set up a free clinic for diagnosis and treatment as far back as 1913 . But it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ medical care in advance on an annual premium basis from an insurance company , nor is there any present indication that this will ever be possible . Fraternal societies , labor unions , and mutual benefit associations of various kinds have long had systems of sickness insurance . Labor unions usually pay sickness insurance in cash , and even this is usually inadequate . The same thing is true of the miscellaneous mutual benefit associations , though some of them do reasonably good work as far as they go . As for " lodge practice , " it has become a byword among physicians for poor pay and correspondingly poor service , and few doctors care to engage in it except under dire necessity . The doctors who do undertake it are likely to do so only for the purpose of working up a private practice , to which they retire as soon as possible . The lodge system , as Dr. Richard C. Cabot has said , " encourages disgracefully low standards of medical work , hurried and botched examinations , guesses at diagnosis , treatment that is a wretched @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in considering the medical situation . These attempts to obtain security against the costs of sickness are pitifully inadequate , yet they represent a need which is desperately real . When we pass to industrial group medicine we find something which is far better organized and which holds out a tangible hope . Medical care is often provided by industrial corporations without direct cost to the employee . Yet , since it makes little actual difference whether a given corporation spends $10 to $25 a year per capita on medical service to its employees or adds that much to the average annual wage and then charges the employees for the service , we may consider these industrial systems as a form of sickness insurance . The only difference is that the worker is more disposed to take his medical benefits when they are seemingly offered him for nothing . Many industrial insurance schemes have arisen out of pure necessity , as in lumber camps or remote mining communities where injuries were frequent and the services of physicians and surgeons would not otherwise have been available . There is not much room @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the houses , the stores , the churches , and the recreational facilities are owned by a single corporation . We might as well expect the private practitioner to flourish in communistic Russia . Consequently we need not attach too much importance to " group practice " or group insurance under such circumstances , any more than we should to the fact that soldiers and enlisted men in the navy are cared for by service doctors rather than left to shop around among general practitioners and specialists as the rest of us do . But in some cases corporations under enlightened management have gone so far as to furnish complete medical care , even when the customary facilities were already available to those who could pay for them . They have done this because it became painfully obvious that their employees could not pay for adequate care in sickness . Some thirteen years ago the Endicott-Johnson Corporation , which does a large-scale tanning and shoemaking business in five New York towns , undertook to furnish complete medical service without charge to all its employees and their families . This step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was part of a " welfare " program which included profit-sharing and old-age pensions . Within a decade after its establishment the corporation 's medical organization was caring for ninety per cent of its 15,000 workers and their families , a total of more than 40,000 individuals , at a cost of about $900,000 a year . This works out at about $22 per annum for those to whom the service was available and about $28 ? or just a little more than the average American pays for medical service each year ? for those who actually used it . The company may have more than recovered its expenditures in the increased contentment and efficiency of its workers . But I am less interested in who paid for the service than in what the money bought . If $22 or even $28 a year for each individual will pay for all that a family needs in the way of medical care and insure it permanently against being bankrupted by medical bills , the Endicott-Johnson plan is of enormous importance . What , then , does $28 a year buy for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for my information on a report made by Dr. Niles Carpenter and others for the Committee on the Cost of Medical Care . The service employed more than one hundred full-time staff members , of whom 28 were physicians . In a single year the physicians made 87,400 house calls ? or more than two for each person using the service ? and received 118,740 office calls ? or more than three for each person . There are three medical centers with hospital service , a first-aid station and clinic , and a number of traveling clinics . Every emergency , literally from childbirth to death , is provided for . Each family , as far as possible , is allowed to select its own physician , with whom its relations are much like those of any family with its family doctor . Maternity care is provided ; there are clinics for children and babies ; teeth are filled or extracted when necessary ; there is a " psychological adjustment " clinic ; chronic and acute diseases are cared for ; and all the usual medical specialties are included . Cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ staff are referred to specialists in outside practice or treated in outside hospitals . In a single yearthe corporation paid $250,000 to community hospitals and $40,000 to outside specialists . In addition to this a convalescent home and rest house for girls and women is maintained , and two tuberculosis cottages at Saranac Lake . The salaried physicians of the staff receive from $3,000 to $1e,000 a year for their full time . If they get less than the most successful private practitioners in their community , they get more than the ( financially ) less successful . And they are free from business worries , have no bills to collect , and can give all their time and thought to the job of making and keeping their patients well . It is often said that salaried positions kill a physician 's ambition . They may kill it financially . They need not kill it professionally if he has adequate hospital and laboratory facilities and a group of patients large enough to provide him with experience over a wide range of cases . I have not gone into details about this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though there can be no doubt that this plan deserves praise . But the majority of us can not find jobs with enlightened corporations which will give us excellent medical care for nothing . The point about the Endicott-Johnson plan is that it is a group plan , operated at moderate cost , and that it works . The same principles might be utilized by a co-operative group of families ; and if the same organizing and administrative ability were applied , there is no reason why as excellent a result should not be obtained . For another illustration of successful group practice we might turn to the medical systems which have been adopted by various schools and colleges . They are paternalistic in much the same way , though under different circumstances and for different reasons . The student , Iike the employee , must be well if he is to do his best work . Moreover , if his education is to be well-rounded he ought to go out into the world with at least a rudimentary idea of how to keep well . About 95 colleges and universities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have a medical service for their students , who are usually charged a special fee to cover the cost . The University of Michigan , for example , with an enrollment of about 13,000 students , has six full-time physicians , 10 part-time physicians , one part-time dentist , and 20 nurses , social workers , laboratory technicians , and other employees . The student pays $10 a year , and all his medical and dental needs are attended to . The rate can be kept low because college students are at a healthy age . But there is seemingly no reason why the same system , with some other oganiza.tion taking the place of the university or college , should not work just as well for the same individuals after graduation . It may well be a shock to a student who has been paying $10 a year for medical care to find himself several years later with hospital and doctor 's bills running into the hundreds and even thousands of dollars . My next illustration might be listed under the head of " state medicine " ? which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ American physicians . It is state medicine in the sense that it is a system of medical care supported out of taxation . But essentially it is an act of co-operation on the part of an entire community . I refer to the " municipal doctors " ? the " municipality " in this case corresponds to the American county ? of Saskatchewan . The Saskatchewan municipal doctor is not a " system . " He is not a deliberate attempt at " socialized medicine . " He is merely the most convenient arrangement for meeting an emergency in the lives of some twenty wheat-growing communities in the Canadian Middle West . About ten years ago these communities began to be dissatisfied with the results of private medical practice . In some cases the doctors were dissatisfied , too . Patients complained that medical care cost too much and was not always easily available or of the best quality ; doctors that they found it hard to collect their bills and make a living . Some doctors were hired by the municipality in order to keep them from moving away ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and fees for certain services were allowed which enabled an average doctor to earn a net income of between $4,500 and $5,000 . The money was raised by taxes on land . After ten years both physicians and laymen , according to a report by Doctor Rorem , whom 1 have already quote &; are well satisfied with the plan . The cost of the doctor 's salary alone runs from $7.50 to $10 a year for each family . In a typical community all costs , including the doctor 's salary and fees , drugs and medicines , special nursing , hospital , and doctor 's charges for patients who needed the attention of specialists or had to be sent to outside hospitals , and contributions toward the provincial public health service and tuberculosis sanitarium came to the surprisingly low figure of $20 a year per family ? less than one-fifth of what the average American family pays . I do not hold the plan up as a model for every American rural county to follow . If any one generalization emerges from a study of group medicine in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this field are dangerous . But some rural communities in this country do contrive to keep their physicians by subsidizing them as public health officers ; and it might not be hopelessly un-American in certain instances to pay them full salaries out of tax money . Surety nothing is so un-American , in the flattering sense of that word , as a community which lacks the fundamentals of good medical care . These experiments are evidences not of a peevish dissatisfaction with conventional medical practice but of a desire to supplement or improve what we now have . The problem is a practical one . It presents endless variations and complexities . But there is a real crisis . What else can we call a state of affairs under which , in so advanced a commonwealth as Massachusetts , " about one-third of the individuals sick with chronic disease " ? the quotation is from Dr. Herbert L. Lombard --  " are not receiving medical care " ? If this is true of Massachusetts , with its high standards of material civilization , the situation must be worse in poorer and more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the country as a whole is to enjoy the full benefit of existing medical knowledge , and if future additions to that knowledge are to be promptly and generally applied . I think we can guess at the nature of those changes from what has already happened . They will not , I believe , include compulsory state sickness insurance . Yet if this were the only means by which adequate medical care could be provided for all the people I do not see how any physician or layman could conscientiously object to it . The patient is more important than the physician , since he is the physician 's reason for existence , and the health of the nation is more important than any theory . At the present time twenty-three nations have compulsory sickness insurance for at least a part of their population . The system has existed in Germany for nearly half a century , in Austria and Hungary for forty years or more , in other countries for shorterperiods . Even where it is being subjected to severe criticism , based on real abuses , as it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will ever be discontinued . The argument for it is the unanswerable one that it works . If America rejects it ? as in this generation , at least , it undoubtedly will ? it must find another system or variety of systems that will work as well or better . If we examine the European insurance schemes we find , to quote from a publication of the Commission on Medical Education , that they " are financed by a combination of contributions from the insured persons and employers , compulsory savings , and indirect taxation , " and that " the provisions for medical care are only a part of a much larger scheme of insurance against incapacity , disablement , unemployment , old age , and other economic risks . " They affect populations which are accustomed to paternalism , as ours is not , and which at the time the insurance acts were passed were conspicuously lower than ours in living standards and in standards of medical care . In Great Britain , whose civilization most closely resembles our own , compulsory insurance developed out of the voluntary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and trade unions . Grave abuses had arisen in this kind of practice . " The remuneration of the doctors was low , " states the report of the Commission on Medical Education which has already been quoted . " The doctors were inclined in many instances to give superficial and perfunctory services . Many persons who were able to pay somewhat more than the contributions took advantage of these various types of contract practice to obtain cheap medical care . Many abuses grew out of the system . Physicians not infrequently accepted more appointments to local clubs than they could take care of , not so much to increase their incomes as to keep competitors out of the community . Canvassing and other forms of questionable procedure were resorted to , and the whole situation became very unsatisfactory for everyone concerned . " The chain of events is clear . Individualistic medicine did not give the British worker adequate care . When he organized to remedy the situation he probably improved matters somewhat , but in doing so produced other conditions which were also unsatisfactory . Here is an object @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ study carefully . There is every reason to believe that we shall be compelled to organize medical service on a scale beyond anything yet attempted in this country . Indeed , as we have seen , the process of organization is now going forward as the only means of escape from our present dangerous and costly medical anarchy . If we are to avoid socialization we must organize voluntarily on a sounder and more businesslike basis than the British voluntary societies were able to attain . We must approach the problem as a wise manufacturer approaches a problem of physical production and distribution ? by a patient and exhaustive study of previous experience in this field and by prolonged experimentation . Whether we ? the " we " of majority public opinion ? plan it or not , the drift away from the old-fashioned individualistic type of medical practice will continue . The varieties of group medicine we have glanced at in this article are certain to develop . There will be more medical centers , more community hospitals , more private group clinics , more contract practice , more group @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even geographical organizations . The physician will become less a business man , less , perhaps , a priest of hiddenmysteries , more a teacher and guide . More and more emphasis will be placed upon preventive medicine , upon the achievement of Life and health as opposed to the mere postponement of sickness and death . I think we may sense what may almost be called a popular revolt that is demanding these things . I am sure that the most humane and enlightened physicians desire them . Our medical crisis is thus twofold . It is , first , the menace of an existing condition under which the full and free application of the healing art is woefully hindered . It is , second , the danger that the movement to remedy this condition will go astray . When a physician explains why he is opposed to state medicine the gist of his argument almost always is that he fears to come under the control of " politicians " ? that is to say , of laymen who will interfere in matters concerning which they have no proper knowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be a misfortune . I talked not long ago to a distinguished physician with long experience as a hospital executive who was completely cured of a belief in state medicine by serving as health officer of a large American city . But the same danger of lay control of medical matters might arise even in a voluntary and unofficial organization . It might arise in an industrial health service or in a large and powerful mutual benefit society . It can be avoided only if everyone concerned can be made to realize that , while health is a public concern , the methods of promoting health are matters for the highly trained technician . There must be a democracy of purpose and , as in all cases in which experts have to be called in , an authority of means . To achieve this combination will call for at least as notable an effort of the American genius as the building of the railroads or the development of the automobile industry . The American medical system of the future must be built from the bottom up , not from the top @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as taking on a new and more effective function , must build himself into it . The state 's function will be to cooperate , through its existing agencies , not to compel . The layman must give up his nostrums , prejudices , and superstitions ; the doctor must surrender the hocus-pocus and pretentiousness which he has inherited from his medieval predecessors . This is , possibly , a large order . But those who reject it as impracticable or undesirable are leaving no choice except between a continuance of the present condition of medical anarchy on the one hand and a political dictatorship over medical practice on the other .
