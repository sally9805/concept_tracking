txt Will Rogers Finds Out California Has Rivers BEVERLY HILLS , Calif. , Jan. 1 . ? Everybody comes to California and they see a lot of great wide rocky sandy creek and river beds with not a hot water bottle full of water in ' em , and they are a big joke . They wonder what they are for . Well , yesterday they showed what they were there for . Us old settlers ( that have been here five or ten years ) never saw anything like it . We are so tickled to see rain out here that we put on a big parade in honor of it . I am writing this before I go to the big game today . I am about half mad because Nicholas Murray Butler did n't come out here with his team . Somebody ought to have told him it was a Republican convention . That 's his principal relaxation . Yours , WILL ROGERS .
