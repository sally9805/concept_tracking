RODEO-R . B. Cunninghame Graham - Doubleday , Doran ( $2.50 ) . <P> Among first-rate British writers of the immediate past , the reputation of Robert Bontine Cunninghame Graham has dimmed more rapidly than that of any of his long-lived literary generation . Vaguely known to many as a friend of Conrad and W. H. Hudson , to a few admirers as the best writer in English on South America , his death last March evoked little more than the perfunctory tributes , compounded of respect and surprise , that seem to be reserved for literary figures who are generally thought to have been dead for years . But Cunninghame Graham was no mere Victorian period piece surviving to a cynical and indifferent age . Born in London in 1852 , he was brought up by his Spanish grandmother and his Scotch father , lived through enough careers in his 84 years to make such celebrated literary men of action as Doughty or Wilfrid Blunt seem sedentary by comparison . Leaving school before he was 17 , he sailed to South America , traded in cattle and mules @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to ride like a Gaucho and usually lived like one . At 27 he married a Chilean , " Gabriella , the daughter of Don Francisco Jose de la Balmondiere , " took her on a honeymoon , part of which was a trip by wagon and horseback from San Antonio , Tex . to Mexico City . In 1879 this journey took 50 days and the travelers were in constant danger of Indian attacks . Cunninghame Graham taught fencing in Mexico City , returned to the cattle business in South America , learned when his father died in 1884 that debts on the estate amounted to more than 100,000 . It took him ten years to pay everything off . <P> Meanwhile he turned out well-phrased records of his adventures , was a Socialist member of Parliament , spent two months in jail for rioting , made a scornful speech which inspired Shaw in writing Arms and the Man , organized the Scottish Labour Party , built up close friendships with William Morris , Joseph Conrad , Hudson and Parnell . He disguised himself as a doctor , traveled to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was imprisoned , returned to Scotland to rebuild his estate , covered South America buying horses and cattle during the War , helped found the Scottish Nationalist Party at the age of 76 . With all this he wrote some 30 books , publishing the first when he was 43 . He had returned to Buenos Aires to see an edition of W. H. Hudson 's works through the press when he died of pneumonia on March 20 , of this year .
