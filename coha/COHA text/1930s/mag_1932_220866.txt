The Roman Catholic Church has lately noticed in rural Europe an increase of morbid , ultra-mystical worshippers and of strange fanatical figures deemed holy by the ignorant . Fairly well-known by Catholics throughout the world are the German peasant Therese Neumann and the Italian Franciscan Padre Pio , both of whom are reputed to have stigmata on their bodies . In Belgium and in Northern Spain are nuns who " sweat blood " during their devotions . Last week the Church moved to quiet the activities of all such persons . The Holy Office in Rome ordered the Belgian and Spanish women to be treated as medical cases . Padre Pio and Therese Neumann were forbidden to receive pilgrims . Padre Pio was ordered to cease singing mass in the Apulian village where a cult almost of sainthood has grown up around him . The Holy Office put on the Index Expurgatorius the large amount of mystic literature written around Padre Pio , and suppressed a and hysterical . Also disciplined were the " Little Victims of Christ , " the Order of St. Bridget of Sweden , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the world as to be called " buried alive . " Margherita Spezzaferri , founder of the " Little Hosts , " was forbidden the use of any religious building for services . The other nuns were to be transferred to less ecstatic nunneries .
