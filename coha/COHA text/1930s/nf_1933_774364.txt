txt  | respect to third parties . In Illinois , for example , two high-school boards were elected in the same district . The so-called " Hopewell board " was legally elected and was clearly the de : lure board , but it failed to take any action pending the outcome of a controversy with the other board , known as the " town-hall board . " The latter board , although it had been irregularly elected , issued bonds , employed teachers , and did other things necessary for the maintenance of the school . Quo warranto proceedings were brought to determine the authority of the town-hall board to act , and a judgment of ouster was issued against it . Subsequently , action was brought to enjoin the collection of taxes levied by the town-hall board . The court refused to grant the injunction . The chief question in dispute in this case is whether the so-called town hall high school board was a de facto board at the time the resolution to levy such taxes was passed . It is conceded by both sides that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the de jure board on that date . Counsel for appellant insist that the Hopewell board on that date was also the de facto board , and that therefore the town hall board could not have been a de facto board ; that two persons can not be officers de facto in the same office at the same time , as there can not be two incumbents at once The board of educator elected at the town hall meeting was the only board of education that assumed of attempted to transact any business for said township high school district up to and after the time of making the levy in this case and the beginning of the proceeding . Its members were not mere volunteers . They were ' elected at an election held under notice , at which they received a much larger vote than was cast for the Hopewell board of education . They had a certificate of election from the pr.oper officials if a proper notice for the town hall election had been given . We are-dispcsed to hold that under the decisions they had such color of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under the circumstances of this case . It must be conceded on this record that there existed de jure offices , as to said high school board , to be filled , and that the Hopewell board were the de jure officers . While there can not be a de facto officer if a de jure officer is exercising the functions of the office in question , .... such was not the case here . The Hopewell school board , after it was organized , did not attempt to act as a board . The so-called town hall board , from the time of their election until they were ousted in the quo warranto proceedings , assumed to act as such board of education . They were the only officials that did attempt to so act . They were in actual possession of the office . Their possession was acquiesced in and acknowledged by the public to such an extent that , so far as the public and third persons are concerned , they must be held to be the de facto board of education at the time this levy was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by statute that public officers shall hold office for a specified term and until their successors are elected and qualified . When such is the case , there is no question but that an officer is entitled to hold over until a qualified successor has been elected or appointed ; " and for services rendered while holding over he is entitled to such compensation as the law provides . The rule holds even though there may be a provision in the constitution limiting the term of office to a given number of years or making the incumbent ineligible for re-election . " Whether or not an officer may hold over until a successor is elected and qualified , in the absence of any constitutional or statutory provision , is a question upon which the authorities are not wholly agreed . The American courts have generally adopted the rule , however , that a public officer may hold over beyond his official term until a successor is elected and qualified , unless such holding over is expressly or impliedly prohibited . Public policy demands that there be someone to perform the duties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ great inconvenience and hardship . Thus it was said by the Court of Appeals of Maryland : The office being a trust created for the public good , it follows that a cessation of the benefits derived from it ought not to be sanctioned because of a failure to make an appointment by those whose duty it is to appoint . No such failure should be permitted to cause a temporary extinction of the trust . Moreover , an officer who holds over after the expiration of the term for which he was appointed or elected is entitled to compensation .  | The constitution of South Dakota provided that no person should be eligible for the office of county superintendent for more than four years in succession . A superintendent had served for four years but the person elected as his successor was ineligible . Although there was no provision in the constitution or statutes authorizing him to hold over until a successor was elected and qualified , the superintendent continued to perform the duties of the office . Subsequently he brought action to recover his salary for services rendered after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stated the rule governing such cases as follows : The general rule seems to be that , in the absence of a statute or constitutional provision in terms prohibiting an officer from holding over after the expiration of his term , such officer may continue to retain and perform the duties of his office after the expiration of his term until his successor is elected or appointed and qualified . Mr. Mechem on Public Officers , ? 397 , says : " It is usually provided by law that officers elected or appointed for a fixed term shall hold not only for that term but until their successors are elected and qualified Where , however , no such provision is made the question of the right of the incumbent to hold over is not so clear , but the prevailing opinion in this country seems to be that , unless such holding over be expressly or impliedly prohibited , the incumbent may continue to hold until some one else is elected and qualified to assume the office " ? citing numerous authorities . And in 29 Cyc. 1399 , it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his term , where no provision is made by statute for holding over , is , although not regarded as in most respects a de jure officer , entitled to the salary appended to the office " In the case at bar it was determined by the adjudication of the court that Agnes E. Gee was ineligible to hold the office , and therefore was not an officer de jure . It necessarily follows , therefore , that the appellant was not only entitled to hold and perform the duties of the office until his successor should be elected or appointed and qualified , but that he was also entitled to the salary and emoluments of the office until the election or appointment of a successor . " There seems to be some difference of opinion with respect to the right of a public officer to resign his office . In England under the common law a municipal office was regarded as a public duty or burden which every one elected or appointed to such an office must bear in the interest of good government and of the community . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ perform its duties , it  | naturally followed that the office could not be resigned without the consent of the appointing power . Otherwise the public interest might suffer from the want of public servants to enforce the laws . In this country an officer has the right to resign , but his resignation is ineffective until accepted by the proper authority In this connection it was said by Chief Justice Ruffin , speaking for the Supreme Court of North Carolina : An officer may certainly resign ; but without acceptance his resignation is nothing and he remains in office . It is not true that an office is held at the will of either party . It is held at the will of both . Generally resignations are accepted ; and that has been so much a matter of course , with respect to lucrative offices , as to have grown into a common notion that to resign is a matter of right . But it is otherwise . The public has a right to the services of all the citizens , and may demand them in all civil departments @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on our statute books general acts to compel men to serve in offices Every man is obliged , upon a general principle , after entering upon his office to discharge the duties of it while he continues in office , and he can not lay it down until the public , or those to whom the authority is confided , are satisfied that the office is in a proper state to be left , and the officer discharged . The foregoing passage from the opinion of Justice Ruffin has been quoted with approval by the Supreme Court of the United States and seems to be supported by reason and the weight of authority . In some jurisdictions , however , it is held that a public officer has the absolute right to resign and that the mere tender of a resignation to the proper officer or body vacates the office without an acceptance of the resignation . " In case the statutes do not designate the authority to whom a  | resignation should be tendered , the general rule is that a resignation should be made to the appointing power , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ official authorized to call an election for the selection of a successor . It is necessary , of course , that the resignation be addressed to the proper authority as provided for by statute . In Oregon , for example , a statute provided that in case there should be a vacancy in a board of school directors the remaining members of the board should call a meeting of the district to fill the vacancy . A resignation was tendered to and accepted by the voters of the district . The court held that there had been no resignation because it had not been tendered to and acted upon by the proper authorities . One can not resign an office to which he has not been elected or appointed on the principle that one can not resign what one does not possess . " ' This may seem too obvious for serious consideration , and yet there are instances where an officer has been required to sign an undated resignation and place it in the hands of the appointing power before the appointment . In Chicago , for example , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an undated resignation before receiving appointment by the mayor . After they had been performing the duties of the office for some time , the mayor accepted their resignations . In passing upon the right of the board members to continue in office , the Supreme Court of Illinois used the following language ? Respondents admit the resignations were signed by the relators and placed in the hands of the mayor before they were appointed , but it is contended that as the resignations were not recalled by the relators after their appointment but were permitted to remain with the mayor without objection , this was , in effect , a continued invitation or permission to the mayor to accept them at his pleasure , and the mayor having acted upon them , relators can not now be heard to complain . We can not agree with this contention It was never contemplated that where the law conferred the power to appoint but not to remove ,  | the power to remove might be conferred by requiring a person , before appointment , to place his resignation in the hands of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ signed , and lapse of time can not render it valid . It has even been held that after election to office a person may not resign until duly qualified , and a resignation tendered to ac-cepted by the proper authority before induction into office is void , and does not prohibit the officer-elect from reconsidering the matter and assuming the duties of the office . Under certain circumstances public officers have a right to withdraw resignations . In considering the right of an officer to withdraw his resignation , it is necessary to keep in mind the distinction between an unconditional resignation , one to take effect immediately , and a prospective resignation , one to take effect at some future date . The weight of authority , it seems , is to the effect that an unconditional resignation to take immediate effect can not be withdrawn . In the case of Pace v. People , a county superintendent of schools addressed and presented a paper to the county court in which it was stated : " The undersigned hereby tenders his resignation as county superintendent of schools . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The court held the resignation was unconditional and could not be recalled . Similarly , it was said in the case of State v. Hauss : " Our conclusion is that where an officer has transmitted his written resignation of an office to , and it has been received by , the officer or authority appointed by law to receive it , to take immediate effect , he can not withdraw it , and that there is a vacancy to be filled by the proper authority . " " It has been held , too , that the transmission of a resignation to take immediate effect with the intention that it be delivered to the proper authority makes the resignation complete and effectual and it can not be withdrawn 82 In some states , however , it is held that a resignation to take place at once may be withdrawn before being acted upon . Where an un-  | conditional resignation has become complete and effectual , either by transmission or acceptance , it can not be withdrawn . This is true even though the power authorized to accept it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ law governs the withdrawal of a prospective resignation , one to take effect at some future date . It is commonly held that such a resignation may be withdrawn at any time before acceptance ! , Thus it was said in the case of Biddle v. Wil-lard : Hence , a prospective resignation may , in point of law , amount but to a notice of intention to resign at a future date , or a proposition to so resign ; and for the reason that it is not accompanied by the giving up of the office possession is still retained , and may not necessarily be surrendered until the expiration of the legal term of the office , because the officer may recall his resignation ? may withdraw his proposition to resign . He certainly can do this at any time before it is accepted ; and after it is accepted , he may make the withdrawal by the consent of the authority accepting , where no rights have intervened 86 In Detroit a school-board member tendered his resignation to the mayor , who refused to accept it . Before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the resignation was withdrawn . The court held that the office had not been vacated . " The right to withdraw a prospective resignation after it has been accepted and before the date of its going into effect , without the consent of the accepting authority , is a question upon which there is a difference of opinion . In the case of Saunders v. O'Bannon , a school-board member tendered his resignation to become effective at the end of the school year , and it was accepted . Before the date upon which the resignation was to take effect , he attempted to withdraw it , but failed to get the consent of the board , the body which had accepted it . The court held that the failure to secure the consent of the board was fatal and the attempted withdrawal was ineffective .  | In other cases , it has been held , however , that the consent of the accepting authority is not necessary where the withdrawal takes place before the date fixed for the resignation to go into effect . A temporary absence from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does not render the office vacant . Failure to perform the duties of an office may subject the officer to whatever penalties the law may prescribe , but it does not create a vacancy . The authorities seem to be in accord in holding that nonuser or neglect of duty does not work an abandonment of an office . Before an office will be declared vacant , it must be shown clearly that the officer intended an absolute relinquishment of the office . A temporary removal from the district does not , as a rule , evidence such an intent . In the case of School District No. 54 v. Garrisort , for example , one Walky , a school-district director , moved out of the district a mile or two to make a crop and did not move back until four or five months later . While temporarily removed from the district , Walky performed none of the duties of a director , but there was not sufficient evidence to prove that he intended to abandon or relinquish the office . In holding that Walky was still an officer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seems to be supported by the weight of authority . The nonuser , or neglect of duty , or removal from the district , in order to amount to a vacation of the office , must be not only total and complete , but of such a circumstance as to make it permanent , and under such circumstances so clearly indicating absolute relinquishment as to preclude all future questions of fact . Otherwise there must be a judicial determination of the vacancy of the office before it can be so declared A vacancy in office only exists when there is no person authorized by law to perform the duties of the office . There is such authorized person , as long as the duly elected officer does not remove permanently from the district or has not intentionally and absolutely relinquished the office .  | Similarly , in the case of State v. Board of Education , a school-board member was absent from the district while with the army in France . In his absence a successor was elected , but upon his return he claimed title to the office . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not intended to resign the office and his temporary absence did not constitute abandonment . In a number of jurisdictions it is provided by the constitution or by statute that certain school officers may not be removed from office without notice of the charges against them and an opportunity to be heard in their own defense . The right of a public officer to notice and a hearing , in the absence of any express constitutional or statutory provision on the subject , depends upon whether or not the original appointment or election was for a fixed and definite term . The authorities seem to be agreed that where an office is held at the pleasure of the appointing power , or where the power of removal may be exercised at discretion , an officer may be removed without charges having been preferred or an opportunity to be heard . ' " Where an appointment is during pleasure , or the power of removal is entirely discretionary , there the will of the appointing or removing power is without control , and no reason can be asked for , nor is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 94 It is sometimes difficult to determine whether the law intended to authorize the appointing power to remove officers at pleasure . The rule seems to be that when an officer is appointed for an indefinite term , the power of removal may be exercised at discretion . A statute of Kentucky , for example , authorized the county superintendent to appoint examiners but prescribed no definite term of office for such appointees . In holding that the superintendent might dismiss them at pleasure , the court stated the general principle as follows :  | The general rule is : " Where the power of appointment is conferred in general terms and without restriction , the power of removal in the discretion and at the will of the appointing power , is implied , and always exists unless restrained , and limited by some provision of law . " In a few cases it has been held that an officer holding for a fixed term , subject to removal for cause , may be removed without notice and a hearing An Illinois statute authorized the county board to remove the county @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or omission of duty . " A county superintendent was removed without notice or hearing on the ground that on a number of occasions he had been intoxicated when he should have been or was performing his duties . In holding that notice and a hearing were not necessary , the court said : " In cases where the statute is silent as to notice to the party to be removed from office , this court has had frequent occasion to say no notice will be required . " 97 But when an officer is thus removed without charges preferred and an opportunity to defend , the courts , no doubt , will , in a proper action , determine whether sufficient grounds existed for removal . The overwhelming weight of authority , however , is to the effect that an officer who holds office during good behavior , or for a fixed term , subject to removal for cause , is entitled to notice of the charges preferred against him and an opportunity to be heard . Nor does it matter that the statute conferring authority to remove an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus it was said by the Supreme Court of Kansas Nothing in the law warrants the implication that a school-district officer who has been elected and qualified and entered upon his duties may be removed at the will or pleasure of any officer . The statute prescribes the causes for which a removal may be had , and fairly implies that the cause must be shown , and that the party charged with negligence and wrong is entitled to notice and a  | right to be heard in his own defense . It is well established by the great weight of authority , that where an officer is elected by the people for a definite term , and provision is made for his removal for cause , the power of removal can not , in the absence of the positive mandate of statute , be exercised without notice and hearing . The mere silence of the statute with respect to notice and hearing will not justify the removal of such an officer upon a charge of misconduct and negligence , without knowledge of the charges and an opportunity to explain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pennsylvania a statute authorized the state superintendent of schools to remove any county superintendent " for neglect of duty , incompetency , or immorality . " A county superintendent who had been elected for a period of three years was removed without charges having been preferred , and without opportunity to defend . In holding that failure to give notice and a hearing was conclusive of the case , the court said : " On this question right to be heard the authorities in England and in this country are clear , distinct , and emphatic , and in entire accord with the spirit of our free institutions . The power to remove an officer , it has been said , is essentially a judicial one , except when exercised by the appointing power , and being such , principles of natural justice demand that no one be condemned unheard . It , is the utmost stretch of arbitrary power and a despotic denial of justice to strip an incumbent of his public office and deprive him of its emoluments and income before its prescribed term has elapsed , except for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ investigation after due notice . There seems to be some difference of opinion with respect to the authority of the legislature to provide for the removal of public officers without notice and an opportunity to defend . Some courts hold that such legislation is contrary to the constitutional provision that no person shall be deprived of property without due process of law . In Georgia , for example , a statute provided for the removal of members of a county board of education for certain offenses , but no provision was made for a hearing of charges against them as a condition precedent to removal . The court held the statute to be unconstitutional and void :  | It may therefore be considered as settled beyond all doubt or peradventure , that a public officer who has under the law a fixed term of office , and who is removable only for definite and specified causes , can not be removed without notice and a hearing on the charge or charges preferred against him , with an opportunity to make defense . It follows necessarily that a statute providing for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incapacity , neglect of duty , or other cause , and which makes no provision for giving him notice , or for allowing him to be heard in his defense , is contrary to the constitutional guaranty which declares that no person shall be deprived of life , liberty or property without due process of law . Other courts , however , take the position that one 's right to a public office is not property , and therefore a statute which provides for removal of an officer without notice and a hearing does not violate that clause of the federal constitution which prohibits any state from depriving a citizen of property without due process of law . ' ? 3 Thus , in New York a statute authorized the commissioner of education to remove any school officer whenever it should be proved to his satisfaction that such officer had been guilty of wilful neglect of duty . The commissioner of education removed a school commissioner without notice or hearing , and the court sustained his action under the statute : The office which he held as school commissioner was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hearing was a taking without due process of law The Legislature has the power to authorize an officer or board to remove an appointive or elective officer without notice or hearing.104 And in Texas a statute provided for the recall of members of a board of education . In passing upon the constitutionality of the statute , the court said : The office of member of the board of education of Dallas is not " property " within the meaning of that word as used in the state and federal Constitutions . Offices are created for the public good , at the will of the legislative power , with such privileges and emoluments attached as are believed to be necessary to make them accomplish the purposes designed . The office of member of the board of education of Dallas is property only in the sense that the incumbent is entitled to receive the emoluments of the office so long as he holds the same and until he has ceased to legally occupy the office .  | Even though notice and a hearing may be required before an officer can be removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rules of procedure of a regularly constituted court of law . A public officer who is being removed from office can not invoke the constitutional right of trial by jury.IO6 It is only necessary to follow the rules of procedure which are essential to the administration of justice . The essential thing is that the officer be notified of the charges against him and be given full and free opportunity to explain and defend his course of action . School officers are state officers , charged with the performance of important public duties . When such an officer is in active possession of an office , the law assumes his title is good , and public policy demands that everyone recognize him as the officer he claims to be until such time as he shall be removed by proper proceedings instituted for that purpose . ' oe Ordinarily , a school officer who is in possession of an office and actually performing its duties can not be restrained from acting upon the ground that his title to the office is defective . No principle of equity jurisprudence seems to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt through the issuance of injunctions to determine disputes with respect to title to public office . This is true for a number of reasons . In the first place , it is almost universally held that title to public office is not subject to collateral attack . ' = ? Moreover , the public have an interest in the performance of the duties of public offices ; and should courts of equity interfere by granting injunctions where title is questioned , the public interest might suffer incalculable injury . Finally ,  | from the very earliest times the law has provided a civil remedy to determine the right to title to public office . The remedy is an action of quo warranto . " This is an action brought in a court of law in the name of the state by the attorney-general or some other officer representing the state to determine directly by what right an officer is exercising the duties of an office of which he is in possession . The early case of Hagner v. Heyberger well illustrates the principles discussed in the preceding paragraph . Action @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school director from exercising the duties of his office . It was claimed he had forfeited his right to the office of school director by accepting another office . Justice Sergeant , speaking for the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania , used the following language : On general principles , I should say that a bill for an injunction is not , in its nature , a proceeding to try the question raised here , whether the defendant , by accepting the office of commissioner of the district of Penn , vacated the office of school director . An injunction would seem to be a writ adapted to control and regulate officers in the discharge of their functions , when they are confessedly such , rather than to try their right to hold and exercise their offices In addition to this , the difficulty meets us that it would be determining collaterally the right of a person who claims the office by color of title , and exercises it de facto , which it has frequently been held can not be done . To bring his right to a fair trial , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try it ; and in the trial of that right by quo warranto , the law secures to the defendant the privilege of a trial by jury in relation to contested facts , which would be taken away by the proceeding by injunction . While it is generally considered that a quo warranto proceeding is the proper mode of attack upon the defective title of a public officer , such an action can not , as a rule , be brought by private individuals who have no interest in the matter different from that of the public in general . As has been said by the Supreme Court of the United States :  | Offices are created for the benefit of the public , and private parties are not permitted to inquire into the title of persons clothed with the evidence of such offices and in apparent possession of their powers and functions . For the good order and peace of society their authority is to be respected and obeyed until in some regular mode prescribed by law their title is investigated and determined . It is manifest that endless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their title could be called into question . If the state is satisfied with the title of its officers it is not for private citizens to complain . The redress of public wrong is not committed to the hands of private citizens . It follows , therefore , that it is for the state , acting through its properly constituted officers , the attorney-general or state 's attorney , to institute quo warranto proceedings . The rule , however , is subject to modification where a private individual is able to show some special interest in the matter distinct from that of the general public . Thus it is frequently held that one who himself claims title to an office may institute quo warranto proceedings to oust the incumbent .  | One of the most perplexing problems with which school officers have to deal is the determination of the legal authority which they may exercise . Statutes conferring authority on school districts and district officers must necessarily be phrased in somewhat general terms . When laws are framed , it is impossible , of course , to foresee all the specific @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Even if it were possible to foresee the specific acts , it would be impracticable to make an exhaustive enumeration of them . The result is that boards of education frequently desire to pursue particular policies but are in doubt with respect to their authority to proceed , or , even after they have taken action , the action may be challenged in the courts and declared void . Likewise , those who deal with a board of education are confronted with the necessity of ascertaining the authority of the board to act , for acts ultra vires , or in excess of authority , bind neither the district nor its officers . Those who deal with a school district do so at their peril , for all are supposed to know the law . No attempt will be made in this chapter to discuss all the aspects of the authority of boards of education . For example , authority to make rules and regulations governing the conduct of teachers and pupils , to employ and dismiss teachers , to acquire and use school property , and to issue bonds and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The purpose of the paragraphs which follow will be to make clear the general principles which must be applied in determining whether a school board or district is acting within the scope of its authority . A sufficient number of concrete examples will be given to illustrate the practical applications of the principles involved . School districts are quasi-corporations created by the state in order that it may more effectively administer its educational policies . They perform purely public or governmental duties . Being crea- tures of the state , subject entirely to its will , they may be created or abolished at pleasure , and their powers may be added to or taken away . It follows , therefore , that they possess no inherent powers whatsoever ; such authority as they may lawfully exercise is conferred upon them by statute ? Moreover , if there is any doubt that a school district has authority to act , the doubt will be resolved against the district and the power denied .3 One should not , however , confuse exercise of power with exercise of discretion . The courts are slow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their officers ; but , once authority is recognized as existing , discretion in the exercise of that authority will not be controlled unless such discretion is abused . The courts are agreed that a school district may exercise the following powers and no others : ( 1 ) those expressly granted by statute , ( 2 ) those fairly and necessarily implied in the powers expressly granted , and ( 3 ) those essential to the accomplishment of the objects of the corporations The rule governing the exercise of authority by school boards has been well expressed by the Supreme Court of Arkansas . School directors are authorized not only to exercise the powers that are expressly granted by statute but also such powers as may be fairly implied therefrom and from the duties which are expressly imposed upon them . Such powers will be implied when the exercise thereof is clearly necessary to enable them to  | carry out and perform the duties legally imposed upon them . School directors are public officers , and the rules respecting their powers are the same as those that are applicable to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ respecting such powers is that , in addition to the powers expressly given by statute to an officer or board of officers , he or it has by implication such additional powers as are necessary for the due and efficient exercise of the powers expressly granted or which may be fairly implied from the statute granting the express powers . " ? Throop on Public Officers , ? 542.6 The real difficulty , of course , is in determining the powers that are implied and the powers that are implicit in the very existence of the school district . It is to be assumed that the very act of creating a school district vests in it those powers indispensable to the accomplishment of its purpose . The question arises , however , as to what is indispensable . The answer to this question depends on the purposes which the school undertakes to accomplish . The school is a social institution , subject to change in purpose and function as society itself changes , or as ideals and practices of education change . As the school enlarges its program , powers which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the courts should , and do , take cognizance of ; and yet there is danger of going too far in holding that school districts have implied powers . It is not for the courts to usurp the legislative function . If an expanded and enriched educational program demands more corporate powers , it is the duty of the legislature to bestow them . In the effort to determine the expressed or implied powers which boards of education may exercise , it is necessary to keep in mind the following principle of statutory interpretation . Where a statute enumerates in detail the powers conferred on a school board and the enumeration is followed by a general grant of power , the general grant is limited by the specific enumeration ; that is , the general grant is not to be interpreted as though it stood alone ; it must be taken to confer powers of the same general kind as those included in the specific enumeration . The rule has been well expressed by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky . Where , in a statute , general words follow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such general words are not to be construed ordinarily in their broadest sense but will be presumed to be restricted by the par- ticular designations and to apply to and indude only persons or things of the same general kind or class as those specifically mentioned , unless a contrary purpose is clearly manifested . They are deemed to have been used not to the wide extent which they might bear if standing alone but as related to words of more definite and particular meaning , with which they are associated ? There seems to be little , if any , reason to doubt the authority of the legislature to authorize local school boards to maintain junior colleges . Such is the case because the legislature , subject to constitutional restrictions , has plenary power with respect to education . In what seems to be the only case in point , the Supreme Court of Louisiana held constitutional an act which authorized the maintenance of junior colleges by parish boards of education . The act was attacked on the ground that it violated a constitutional provision requiring higher educational institutions to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ education . It was said by the court : " The higher institutions of learning " .... are in an entirely different category from the " Junior Colleges " that may be established . . . . as these colleges , so called , can have no legal existence or status whatever , except in connection with a state high school , are purely local institutions , are maintained by local taxation , and are created for the sole purpose of supplementing the course of studies prescribed in the high schools of the state . A " Junior College " is permitted . . . . merely to supply the place of a super-high school , in the carrying out by the Legislature of the constitutional mandate of co-ordination of the elementary and secondary schools , and the higher educational institutions of the state , so as to lead to the standard of higher education . Necessarily , these " Junior Colleges " fall within the classification of secondary schools , and occupy the same legal status as a state high school in matters of special taxes to be voted at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' There is some uncertainty with respect to the authority of a local school board to maintain a junior college where no such authority has been conferred by specific statutory enactment . In a number of states school boards , acting on the assumption that the junior college is an integral part of the common school system , have established junior colleges without specific statutory authority to do so . In only  | one case , however , have the courts been called upon to decide whether a board of education has the implied power to maintain a junior college as a part of the common school system . The court held that a board of education has such power . It appears from the statement of facts . . . . that the predecessors of the defendants , in the exercise of their best judgment , established , as a part of an adequate and sufficient system of public schools for the city of Asheville , the junior college . That they had the power to establish and maintain said college , in the exercise of this discretion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public-school fund available for the support of the public-school system of the city of Asheville was sufficient not only to support the elementary and high schools , which composed a part of said system , but was sufficient also to support the kindergarten schools , which the said board was required by statute to establish and maintain Said fund was also sufficient to support the junior college . No additional tax was required to provide funds for the support of said public-school system , or any part of it . It is true the establishment and maintenance of the junior college was not mandatory , as was the case with the kindergarten schools , by special statute , .... and as was the case with the elementary and high schools , under the general school law of the State The board of commissioners of the city of Asheville had the power , however , in the exercise of their discretion to establish , maintain and operate the junior college , as a part of an adequate and sufficient system of public schools for the city of Asheville , which was at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school district and not subject to the limitations in the general school law of the State with respect to schools maintained and operated in accordance with its provisions.9 The implied authority of boards of education to require physical examination of pupils is well illustrated in the case of Streich v. Board of Education. = ? The Board of Education of the city of Aberdeen , South Dakota , required each pupil at the beginning of each year to furnish what was known as a " Physical Record Card . " One side of the card was to be filled out by the teacher ; the other , by a licensed physician . It was optional with parents whether the examination be made by a physician of their own choice and at their own expense or by the school physician at the expense of the school  | district . The card to be filled out by the physician called for such information as history of contagious diseases and condition of heart , lungs , throat , teeth , and mouth . Two pupils whose parents were members of the Christian Science church @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the schools of the city . A writ of mandamus was sought to compel their admission . It was contended that the board had no authority to require a physical examination as a condition of admission to school because no such authority had been expressly conferred by statute ; nor could it be implied . Moreover , it was contended that the enforcement of the rule would violate those provisions of the constitution which require a uniform school system , free and open to all ; that the statutes had fixed but two qualifications for admission to school ? age and residence in the district ; that the police power with respect to health regulations had been conferred exclusively on the board of health ; and that the rule in question " compelled the plaintiff 's children either to submit to a trespass upon their most private and social rights or to yield up their right to attend the public schools . " In holding that the board had the implied or inherent power to enforce the rule in question , the court rendered a decision which undoubtedly expresses correct @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board in requiring the " Physical Record Card " was a matter of government , was legislation , and was a regulation relating to the health of the pupils , .... yet it does not follow that , because the Legislature has delegated certain police powers to some specific board , another board or corporate body is denied the exercise of this same power to such an extent as may be necessary to carry out the purposes for which such board or body was created ; certainly no such claim can be made in a case where such board or body was created or authorized by that very legislative department in whom all police power is primarily intrusted by the people To the Legislature is given the power to create and to authorize the creation of municipal and quasi-municipal bodies through which , as governmental agencies , the public welfare is sought to be promoted ; hence we have townships , towns , cities , counties , and school districts Each of such agencies has a certain work to perform in the promotion of such public welfare . Necessarily incident to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is the power to provide those rules and regulations upon the proper enforcement of which depends its ability to perform the particular function for which it was created . While express legislation may give to such agency certain express police  | powers , it should never be held that the naming of these powers precludes it from exercising any other powers ; but it should be held that , upon the creation of a municipal body , it becomes possessed of all necessary and reasonable police power and that express enactments relating to the police power of such body do not curtail the necessary and reasonable police powers of such body except where it is clear that it was the legislative intent to so curtail them . The following words , though spoken of a city , are just as applicable to other bodies created as governmental agencies . " The police power primarily inheres in the state ; but the legislature may , and in common practice does , delegate a large measure of it to municipal corporations . The power thus delegated may be conferred in express terms , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the creation of the corporation . The so-called inferred ' or inherent ' police powers of such corporations are as much delegated powers as are those conferred in express terms , the inference of their delegation growing out of the fact of the creation of the corporation and the additional fact that the corporation can only fully accomplish the objects of its creation by exercising such powers . " The Legislature of this state has not forbidden school districts the exercise of such police power as may be reasonably necessary to insure the proper discharge of the work for which the districts are created . After pointing out that the information sought by the examination would promote the welfare of the child in his school work as well as the well-being of the school as a whole , the court continued as follows : Does the furnishing of this report necessitate such a physical examination as amounts to an unreasonable violation of a sacred right and therefore the requiring of this report amount to an unreasonable exercise of police power ? It is certainly clear for all the reasons hereinbefore stated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unless it is made unreasonable from the fact that it is such a violation of personal right as is not justified by the end sought Need a child suffer any indignity or a violation of any sacred right by submitting to such physical examination as would be necessary in order that a physician might fill out the report called for ? Appellant did not prove , nor do we find anything in the report requiring , that there need be any exposure of the person of the child or any manipulation of its body such as would shock the sensibilities of the most refined person . Here , again , we must not overlook the person who makes the examination ; the conventionalities of our time recognize the absolute propriety of submitting one 's body to the examination of a physician whenever such examination is made for the purpose of gaining information concerning one 's physical condition Such an examination as the report calls for could not subject a child to anything not in perfect harmony with the con- ventions of today , could not subject it to indignity , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the requiring of the report in question was , under all the surrounding conditions , reasonable . A number of cases have come into the courts involving the authority of boards of education to spend school funds for the services of nurses , dentists , and physicians . The courts are in accord in holding that , even in the absence of any specific statutory grant of authority , funds may be spent for such professional services provided the duties performed are merely inspectorial and diagnostic . ' In the case of Hallett v. Post Printing &; Publishing Company , ' an injunction was sought to restrain the Board of Education of Denver from issuing warrants for the maintenance of the school health department , in which it was employing physicians , dentists , and nurses . It was contended that the board had exceeded its lawful authority because there was no statute authorizing the expenditure of public funds for such a purpose . The court refused to issue the injunction on the ground that the board was exercising powers necessarily implied . The court reasoned that the power of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was undoubted . Furthermore , the power to exclude such pupils implied authority to make requirements and to determine whether the requirements had been met . In both cases expert advice was necessary . Moreover , the board had the implied power to provide for the physical education of children . To provide such education , it was necessary to employ suitable persons to determine what was proper and beneficial for each pupil and to prescribe suitable exercises to overcome defects . The court was careful to point out , however , that the duties performed by the dentists and the physicians employed by the board " should not include medical or surgical treatment for disease . That would be to make infirmaries or hospitals of the schools . "  | To the same effect is the decision in the case of State v. Brown.I3 The Board of Education of Minneapolis employed a nurse for one month to make an inspection of the physical condition of the pupils in certain schools . The comptroller of the city refused to countersign the warrants for her salary on the ground that the board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the board exercised an implied power . The purpose of the corporation is to maintain efficient , free public schools within the city of Minneapolis and , unless expressly restricted , necessarily possesses the power to employ such persons as are required to accomplish that purpose . Education of a child means much more than merely communicating to it the content of textbooks . But , even if the term were to be so limited , some discretion must be used by the teacher in determining the amount of study each child is capable of . The physical and mental powers of the individual are so interdependent that no system of education , although designed solely to develop mentality , would be complete which ignored bodily health . And this is peculiarly true of children , whose immaturity renders their mental efforts largely dependent upon physical conditions . It seems that the school authorities and teachers coming directly in contact with the children should have an accurate knowledge of each child 's physical condition for the benefit of the individual child , for the protection of the other children with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intelligent grading of the pupils . These and other considerations convinced the court that the board had the implied authority to employ the nurse for purposes of inspection . There seems to be but one case on record dealing with the implied authority of school boards to maintain clinics for the medical , surgical , and dental treatment of pupils . In 1914 the Board of Education of Seattle appointed a school medical inspector . At that time the city was maintaining a general clinic at the police station , where the inspector discovered certain school children were being brought into contact with criminals and other undesirable citizens . He explained the situation to a number of physicians and dentists , who volunteered to furnish their services free in the maintenance of a clinic for the treatment of pupils whose parents were unable to provide adequate medical attention for them . The board of education equipped  | a building to be used for the purpose . Small fees were charged those who were able to pay , and for a number of years the clinic was selfsupporting . Finally , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and there was an annual deficit of approximately two thousand dollars . Certain taxpayers sought to have the board enjoined from spending school funds for the maintenance of the clinic . In granting the injunction , the court pointed out that a school district possesses only such powers as are delegated in express words , such powers as may be implied from the powers expressly granted , or such powers as are essential for the accomplishment of the purposes for which the district was created . The court was unable to find in the statutes any express authority for the maintenance of a school clinic . The only authority vested in the board with respect to health was authority to cause inspection of buildings and premises with a view to making them sanitary and healthful and to cause inspection of persons with a view to excluding from school premises all persons infected with contagious diseases . Authority to maintain the clinic at public expense could not be implied ; nor was it implicit in the existence of the district . The rendering of medical , surgical , and dental services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been , we think , so foreign to the powers to be exercised by a school district or its officers that such power can not be held to exist in the absence of express legislative language so providing There is much in the argument of counsel for the school officers which might be considered as lending support to the view that such power ought to be possessed by the school district and its officers , and it is probable that counsel has many well-meaning people upon his side of that question . The Legislature may give heed to such arguments , but the courts can not do so . " Frequently normal-school authorities find it desirable to make arrangements whereby the public schools may be used as model or practice schools for the training of prospective teachers . The legal authority of a local school board to co-operate in such an enterprise is obviously a matter of no little importance . There is not a great  | deal of judicial authority on the subject , but such as there is leads to the following conclusions . Where a board of education @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the conduct and management of the public schools , it may , as an exercise of its authority to determine the course of study , maintain a model school for the use of normal-school students . Students doing practice teaching in the public schools are not required to have teachers ' certificates . Employment of practice teachers is merely a variation in the mode of instruction , a matter which falls wholly within the discretion of the school authorities . Control over the practice-school facilities for normal-school students must be exercised exclusively by the school board . The law vests school boards with authority and discretion in the management and control of the public schools , and they may not divest themselves of this authority or delegate it to others . It follows , therefore , that any contract or agreement with normal-school authorities whereby these authorities are given the right to select the teachers of the training school , to determine the course or mode of instruction , or to decide the time the school term shall begin or end is void and without effect . It is , however @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school to pay jointly the salaries of those teachers in charge of the rooms in which practice teaching is done provided the local board in no way limits its discretion to employ such teachers as it may see fit . In a West Virginia case , ' 5 a board of education entered into a contract with the regents of a state normal school whereby the students in the normal school were to be permitted to do practice teaching in one of the public schools in the district . For this privilege the board of regents paid approximately $2,800 annually . In refusing to enjoin the execution of the contract , the court pointed out that the board had authority to promote the educational interests of the district and that it was the board 's duty to do so . The departments that should be established and the courses of instruction that should be given were matters wholly within the discretion of the board . Deeming it to be for the best interests of the district to provide a school or department of practice in teaching for such of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves thoroughly for the profession of teaching , .... the board has made such provision and , in doing so , seems clearly to have acted within its legal powers A commercial department is put in when the existence of enough pupils desiring instruction in that branch reasonably to justify the expense and the sufficiency of the revenues to bear it , are shown . So with other departments . Why does not a department of education in teaching , under the same rule and principle , fall within the power and discretion of the board ? Why does not such a department subserve the educational interests of the district as much as other departments or , at least , on the principle upon which other departments promote them ? Nor is there any fixed legal standard of school management or instruction . The law requires the employment of competent teachers , but there is no express exclusion of assistant or under teachers . The student teachers are not employed ; they receive no compensation ; nor have they a particle of authority in management or control It is a mere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opinion of some people , is unwise and inefficient , and , in the opinion of others , efficient and helpful . Does this not make a case for the exercise of the board 's judgment and discretion in the control , government , and management of the school under power expressly conferred by law ? The court pointed out that the facts did not show whether the students doing practice teaching were residents of the district . In the absence of such facts , the court assumed that they were residents . What the court would have held had it been shown that some of them were non-residents is left in doubt . In the West Virginia case , it will be noted , control over the teacher-training department was exercised exclusively by the board of education . Such control on the part of the board is absolutely necessary in order to make legal the maintenance of a practice school for normal-school students . The law vests in the board discretion in the management and control of the schools , and the exercise of that discretion can not be delegated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school district entered into a contract with the Illinois State Normal University in which it was agreed that the University was to use for practice purposes six or seven elementary classes of the public schools which were to be housed in the normal-school building and two or three additional classes to be housed in public-school buildings . For each class used for practice teaching a critic teacher was to be employed , under whose supervision students from the University were  | to engage in practice teaching . The University was also authorized to furnish student teachers for six high-school classes each term . The critic teachers were to be selected by the concurrent action of the school board and the University board and were to be paid by the two boards jointly . Authority to select the student teachers rested entirely with the University and the city superintendent of schools . The University had authority to make the necessary regulations with respect to the mode of instruction and the daily program of the practice classes . The University instructors in music , drawing , and physical culture were to supervise the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the public schools , one-third of their time being at the disposal of the public-school authorities . Finally , the school year of the public schools was to conform to the calendar of the University . The court held the contract void for the following reasons . The Board of Education of Normal school district is by the act incorporating the town of Normal authorized to manage and control the common schools and transact all business which may be necessary in relation to the common schools and given all the right , power , and authority necessary for the proper management of those schools . Its discretionary powers are broad , but they are powers to conduct and manage common schools only . They include the discretionary power to employ teachers , fix their salaries , and discharge them if they fail to perform their duties in a satisfactory manner ; the power to determine in what grade each teacher shall find employment ; and the power to determine the length of the school terms , when they shall begin , and when they shall end . Such discretionary powers the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an examination of this contract that by it the Board of Education of Normal school district has attempted to delegate the discretionary powers specifically mentioned above Appellant seeks an injunction against the public-school board to prevent the payment of the salaries of the critic teachers . It is apparent from the bill that these critic teachers are employed not to instruct the pupils in the public schools in the common-school branches but to perfect the students of the University in the art of teaching while the latter are endeavoring to teach the pupils of the common schools for the experience thereby afforded . The attempt is to merge two schools into one . The students of the University , without compensation , practice teaching in the grades of the public schools which are being used by the University as practice schools , and the critic teachers supervise and instruct not the pupils of the common schools but the students of the University . The public-school board is without authority to employ teachers to perform the duties of the critic teachers . It follows , therefore , that the contract by which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for the purposes aforesaid is illegal and void and that the payment of those teachers out of the funds of the public school is an unlawful diversion of the public money . Such an unlawful contract is an injury to the taxpayer , and he may have an injunction to prevent the appropriation of the school fund to this purpose , which is not warranted by the law . A case ' 7 involving somewhat the same issues has been decided by the Supreme Court of Iowa . The Iowa State Teachers College arranged with the Board of Education of Cedar Falls for certain students of the College to do practice teaching in the public schools . The practice teaching was to be done under the supervision of the teachers in charge of the classrooms . In employing the teachers who were to have charge of the classrooms in which practice teaching was to be done , the board agreed to take into consideration the recommendations of the College authorities , but it was not to be bound by those recommendations . The salaries of these teachers were to be paid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the College . The College was to employ a head critic teacher to supervise the practice teaching . The agreement as here outlined was put into effect , whereupon action was brought to enjoin the board from continuing the practice . Before the case was heard , the practice teachers were issued temporary teachers ' certificates and given regular contracts by the board at a nominal salary . In refusing to issue an injunction , the court pointed out that there was no evidence that the board had surrendered or delegated its right or authority to act on its uncontrolled judgment in the interests of the schools . Inasmuch as the practice teachers had teachers ' certificates , the necessity of their having such certificates was really not at issue . Nevertheless , the court indicated what no doubt would have been its opinion even if the teachers had been without certificates . It is very doubtful , however , whether the statute prohibiting the employment of uncertified teachers has any application to a case where the person in question does no more than render gratuitous , temporary , or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has the room and pupils in her immediate charge and control . It is certainly neither unknown nor reprehensible practice for a responsible teacher in charge of a school or department to call upon bright and promising students or pupils to assist her in some phase of the work of instruction ; nor is she open to just condemnation if in so doing she is  | actuated more by a desire to encourage and develop the capacity of such young persons than by any pressing need of assistance in her work . The court further pointed out that a statute authorized the district school board to arrange for the attendance of some of the children in the district at the normal training school . No one , it was said , would contend that students teaching in the training school of the College itself should be required to hold teachers ' certificates , " and , if none be required in such case , what better reason is there for demanding them of other students performing the same service in other schools of the same district ? " In answering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of the classrooms in which practice teaching was done were paid jointly by the board of education and the College , the court said : " We are unable to see why a teacher may not lawfully divide her time and labor between two schools and receive compensation from both , where both employers consent and payment is equitably proportioned to each . " The contention was also made that the arrangement to all intents and purposes was the establishment of a school of pedagogy in public-school buildings and that this constituted a misuse of public-school property , to which the board had no legal right to consent . In answer , the court said : " True , the teacher or student having these advantages may acquire valuable training of a character similar to that afforded by a school of pedagogy , but similarity of product does not necessarily argue identity in the source of production . " Finally , it was contended that the board had an adequate teaching staff and that , therefore , the employment of the student teachers was illegal . To this the court @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matter wholly within the discretion of the school authorities . It is uniformly held that normal schools do not constitute a part of the common-school system ! ' It follows , therefore , that neither a local school board nor the legislature itself can apply funds which the  | constitution provides shall be devoted to the use of common schools to the maintenance of a model school in connection with a teachertraining institution.19 The State of Washington , for example , passed an act authorizing the establishment of a model school in each of the normal schools of the state . The act made it the duty of the local school board of each district in which a normal school was located to assign to the model school as many pupils as the authorities of that school might require . The principal of the model school had authority to reject such pupils as he deemed undesirable because of incorrigibility or mental defects . Finally , the act made it the duty of the state superintendent of public instruction to apportion to the support of the model school such part of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to had the children attending the model school attended the public school . Action was brought to restrain the superintendent from apportioning to the model schools any of the funds available for the support of the common schools . The court granted the injunction for the following reasons . The principal of the normal school , however accomplished , is not an officer recognized by the law creating the common-school system and is in no way answerable to those who are charged with the duty of executing it . The teachers under his charge maybe devoted in their pursuit of the art of teaching , but they are not teachers within the meaning of the law , which has undertaken to insure that public-school children shall be taught only by those who have met ( not seeking to attain ) a certain standard of proficiency . In other words , the argument of counsel emphasizes the fact that in its operation the act of 1907 would break the uniformity of the common-school system . To summarize , a common school , within the meaning of our constitution , is one that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , free , and subject to , and under the control of , the qualified voters of the school district . The complete control of the schools is a most important feature , for it carries with it the right of the voters , through their chosen agents , to select qualified teachers , with power to discharge them if they are incompetent . Under the system proposed , instead of the voters employing a teacher with proper vouchers of worthiness , they are made recruiting officers to meet a draft for material that the apprentice may be employed Nor can the legislature by any contrivance , designation , or definition make a  | common school a normal school , or a normal school a common school , within the meaning of the constitution.20 Many states have statutes specifically authorizing school boards to employ attorneys ; but , even in the absence of statutory grant of such authority , a board may , as a general rule , employ counsel to represent the school district whenever its legal rights and interests are involved . " Power to employ counsel is implied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and be sued , and to enter into and enforce contractual obligations . In the case of Arrington v. Jones , 22 the court expressed the rule as follows : There is no authority expressly given to trustees to employ an attorney to bring a suit in behalf of trustees against a teacher to cancel a teaching contract . But , having the power , as trustees have by the terms of the statute , to contract and to sue and be sued in the courts , the authority on the part of trustees to employ an attorney to institute and prosecute an action in their behalf would exist as a necessary incident of the powers to contract and to sue and to manage and control the affairs and interests of the public school . It has been held , too , that a statute authorizing a school board to employ a regular attorney at an annual salary not exceeding a stipulated sum does not preclude the employment of additional attorneys ? 3 The statute , the court pointed out , did not provide that the school attorney should have control @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interested . The statute was declaratory and not restrictive in direct terms or by fair implication of the language used . The authority of a school district to employ counsel to represent it rests , of course , on the assumption that some legitimate right or  | district can not employ counsel to accomplish an unlawful act or to defend an action against private individuals . A school board in Texas , for example , employed counsel to defeat a bill pending before the state legislature . The bill , it was alleged , " would . . . . deprive the district of its existing liability to raise large amounts of funds by taxation necessary to a successful continuance of the public school in the district . " The attorney employed to defeat the bill did not seek to accomplish his purpose by appearing before any legislative committee but addressed letters to individual members of the legislature . The court held the contract between the district and the attorney void as ultra vices and as against public policy . Neither private individuals nor a school district may legally contract to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legislature . This is a principle of law on which the courts seem to be in perfect accord . Contracts to procure legislation , says the Supreme Court of the United States , have been uniformly declared invalid . The decisions have not turned upon the question whether improper influences were contemplated or used but upon the corrupting tendency of the agreements It is sufficient to observe , generally , that all agreements for pecuniary considerations to control the business operations of the government , or the regular administration of justice , or the appointments to public offices , or the ordinary course of legislation , are void as against public policy without reference to the question whether improper means are contemplated or used in their execution . The law looks to the general tendency of such agreements ; and it closes the door to temptation by refusing them recognition in any of the courts of the country . It is entirely permissible , however , for a school board to employ an attorney to represent it before a legislative committee . Such a committee exists in part for the purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ district in Georgia , for example , contracted with an attorney to appear before a committee of the legisla- ture to secure the repeal of a bill abolishing the district . The court held the contract valid . A school board , moreover , can not employ an attorney to enforce the rights of private individuals even though those rights may have grown out of the acts of the board itself . Where , for example , a school board issues warrants in payment of teachers ' salaries and the county superintendent refuses to sign them , the board can not employ counsel to institute mandamus proceedings to require the superintendent to sign the warrants . It was said by the Supreme Court of Florida : The employment of attorneys to conduct litigation to require the county superintendent to countersign warrants issued by the county board of public instruction for teachers ' salaries is not such a county-school purpose as will warrant payment therefor from county-school funds that by the express command of the constitution " shall be disbursed . . . . solely for the maintenance and support of public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were involved ; and , if vindicated at all , they would have to be vindicated by the teachers themselves and at their own expense . In Louisiana , however , it has been held that a board of education has authority to resist an action to garnishee teachers ' salaries . " Under certain circumstances a school board may spend school funds to defend a suit against the members of the board personally . To justify such an expenditure , it must be shown that the board members were acting in a matter in which the corporation had an interest , that they were acting in the discharge of a duty imposed or authorized by law , and that they acted in good faith . In the case of Hotchkiss v. Plunkett , 3 ? for instance , the board of education in purchasing school stationery refused to consider the bid of a certain contractor . The board had purchased stationery from this contractor previously and had found it unsatisfactory . The contractor sued the members of the board personally , and later the question arose  | as to whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ losses sustained in defending the action against them . Applying the principles stated , the court held that the board did have such authority . Where the statutes make it the duty of a state or municipal attorney to represent a school district in all legal controversies , confusion may arise with respect to the authority of the district to employ additional counsel . Are such statutes merely declaratory , or are they restrictive ? According to the weight of authority , they are restrictive to the extent that a board may not ignore altogether the counsel provided by law . Where , however , the attorney provided by law refuses to act or is incapacitated or disqualified , or the business of the corporation is such as to require the services of additional counsel , such additional counsel may be employed.3 ' In the case of McClintic v. Cavender , 32 a statute of West Virginia provided that " it shall be the duty of the prosecuting attorney to attend to , bring or prosecute , or defend , as the case may be , all actions , suits , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ board of education is interested , without additional compensation . " The prosecuting attorney advised the board of education of a school district that he was not required by the statute to represent the district , whereupon it employed other counsel . In passing on the authority of the district to employ additional counsel , the supreme court of appeals said : The next and most important question is : Has the board of education of an independent school district , notwithstanding its right to be advised and represented by the prosecuting attorney and his duties in the premises , the right also to employ other counsel or counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney in extraordinary or important litigation ? Mr. Dillon , than whom there is perhaps no better authority on municipal law , in the recent edition of his great work on municipal corporations , says , " If the scheme of municipal government provides a corporation counsel or city attorney or other legal officer for the municipality whose duty it is to appear on behalf of the municipality in all suits by or against  | the corporation and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the municipality is deprived of its power to employ another attorney to take the place of , and perform the duties which naturally belong to , its law officers . " 2 Dillon on Municipal Corporations ( 5th Ed . ) , Sec. 824 . This is a very clear and comprehensive statement of the law and is well fortified by the numerous decisions cited therefor in the footnote . The words italicized are so emphasized by the author . An examination of the cases cited will show that this rule is based on cases where the municipal authorities have attempted to ignore the rights , duties , and authorities of municipal-law officers , either wholly to supersede them or to waste the public funds in employing counsel not required by any exigency , as refusal , incapacity , neglect , sickness , or disqualification of the regular municipal officer to act in the premises ; or where , by the terms of the charter or laws governing the municipality , legal departments have been created to transact all legal business and the implied power to employ other counsel plainly negatived @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ consideration did not negative the right to employ other counsel to assist the prosecuting attorney and then continued as follows : In the same paragraph Mr. Dillon says : " But the fact that an official attorney is provided for the municipality by law does not preclude the municipality from employing other or additional attorneys to assist him in prosecuting or defending suits against the municipality . " The decisions cited for this proposition are numerous . Some of them do not limit the right to the employment of assistant counsel but give it whenever and wherever in the judgment of the corporate authorities the business of the corporation reasonably requires other or additional counsel . Some courts even go so far as to hold that statutes making it the duty of a district or municipal attorney to furnish free legal advice to the school board do not limit the authority of the board to the employment of assistant counsel . Other counsel may be employed , they hold , whenever , in the judgment of the corporate authorities , the business of the corporation demands such employment . Thus , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Iowa said : One of the duties of a county attorney prescribed by statute is to furnish , free of charge , legal advice to all school-board and township officers when requested so to do by such board or officers . This provision simply defines one of the duties of a county attorney , but the law does not make it mandatory upon a school board or officer to employ the county attorney .  | Similarly , the statutes of Washington made it the duty of the prosecuting attorney of each county to represent all school districts in all criminal or civil actions . The interests of a school district had become antagonistic to the interests of two other districts , with which a consolidation had been attempted . The prosecuting attorney advised the district officers to employ other counsel , and they did so . In sustaining this action , the court said : " The statute heretofore referred to regarding the prosecuting attorneys is merely a definition of their powers and does not attempt to restrain , modify , or define the powers of boards of school directors . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the duty of the county attorney to attend to the prosecution of all cases in which the county or commonwealth was interested . In prosecuting an action against a publisher for an alleged breach of bond , the county superintendent employed additional counsel . His action was sustained by the court of appeals : " We think the superintendent , in the exercise of a reasonable judgment , had the right to employ additional counsel , if their services were necessary under the exigencies of the case , and to pay them a reasonable fee for their services . " Contrary opinion , however , has been expressed by a few courts . In the case of Frederick v. Douglas Counly , 36 a county board of supervisors employed an attorney , a Mr. Grace , in defense of important tax cases because the district attorney of the county was young and inexperienced in tax litigation . The court held that the board had no authority to employ additional counsel " because they had a district attorney qualified and acting . Therefore , the employment of Mr. Grace was to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ratification . " There have been relatively few cases dealing with the authority of school boards to insure school property . There can be little doubt , however , that the power to insure school property is necessarily implied from the general power which a school board possesses to  | manage and control the property of the school district . To deny the officers of a school district authority to protect the district against the loss of its property by fire would be entirely unreasonable . The Appellate Court of Indiana has said in this connection : We are of the opinion that , under the statutory provisions placing upon the trustees the duty of caring for and managing the school property , a township trustee has such implied authority that , in the exercise of his discretion , he may make reasonable expenditures from the special school revenue by way of procuring insurance on such property against fire In Pennsylvania it has been held that , in the absence of legislation to the contrary , a school board may insure a building in the process of construction and embody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There is some doubt as to the authority of a school board to take out insurance in a mutual association where no fixed premium is charged , the losses being prorated among the members . A Kentucky statute authorized county boards of education to insure school property . In sustaining the right of a board to take out insurance in a co-operative or assessment association , the court reasoned as follows : Included in these powers by implication , it would seem that the board of education is authorized to contract for insurance with any insurance corporation which the public policy of the state has by statute authorized to do an insurance business of the character of insuring public-school buildings against fire and other casualties , unless there is a statute which by express provision or necessary implication forbids the board of education to contract with it , or the provisions of its articles of incorporation are such that the nature of the contract which it can enter into is one which the board of education can not for some valid reason effect , and is therefore necessarily excluded as an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some constitutional or statutory provision which renders insurance in a mutual association illegal . Such was the situation in an Idaho case . The constitution pro- vided that no school district should " lend or pledge the credit or faith thereof directly or indirectly , in any manner , to , or in aid of , any individual , association , or incorporation , for any amount or for any purpose whatever , or become responsible for any debt , contract , or liability of any individual , association , or corporation . " It also prohibited any school district from incurring any indebtedness exceeding in any year the income or revenue provided for it for that year . A school district took out insurance in a mutual association , incurring thereby unlimited liability . The schoolhouse was burned , and the company refused payment on the ground that the contract was void . The court sustained the position taken by the company . " To permit a school district to become a member of a county mutual fire-insurance company would be indirectly to sanction the use of public funds raised @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose . " There seems to be but one case dealing with the authority of school boards to carry group life insurance for teachers . In the case of Nohl v. Board of Education , 4 ' action was brought to enjoin the Board of Education of Albuquerque , New Mexico , from using public funds for this purpose . The statutes of New Mexico authorized boards of education to defray all expenses " connected with the proper conduct of the public schools in their respective districts . " Was the expenditure in question connected with the proper conduct of schools ? The court answered this question in the affirmative . It is admitted that the securing of group insurance for the teachers enables the Board of Education to procure a better class of teachers and prevents frequent changes in the teaching force . This is certainly desirable and conducive to the " proper conduct of the public schools . " School funds are now being spent in all the school districts of the state and in many , if not all , of the other states for purposes and objects @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarter of a century ago would have been considered highly improper . In many of the schools we have mechanical instruction in many of the trades and professions which not so many years ago would not have been tolerated . The teaching of music , arts , and science has become a recognized necessity . Many things are provided now for the comfort and convenience of both teachers and pupils which heretofore would have been prohibited by injunction as an improper expenditure of public funds . In some of the schools of the state gymnasiums , swimming pools , playgrounds , and other forms of recreation , amusement ,  | and diversion are provided , because it is recognized by advanced public sentiment that such instrumentalities are calculated to , and do , promote the cause of education and tend to better the schools and keep the pupils and teachers satisfied and contented . Many corporations employing large numbers of laborers throughout the country carry group insurance on such employees with the same object in view as that which evidently was in the minds of the members of the Board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in question was purchased . While the reasoning in this case may be convincing to many , it is very doubtful whether other courts would follow it as a precedent . Since teaching is one of the least hazardous of occupations , a school board is no more justified in purchasing insurance for teachers than it would be in purchasing various other commodities which teachers might be pleased to have . The only other case , it seems , more or less in point , is one in which it was held that a municipality may not insure employees unless authorized to do so by statute.42 It is important that boards of education know how far they may go in delegating authority to the city superintendent or to committees of their own members . The rule seems perfectly clear that , iwhere the law vests the exercise of judgment and discretion in a board of education or other officers of a school district , that exercise of judgment and discretion can not be delegated to any other person or body whatsoever.43 It is equally certain that school boards may delegate to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Thus , where the law makes it the duty of a board to employ teachers , the board may delegate to the superintendent or to a committee the authority to ascertain proper persons to be employed and even to draw up tentative contracts , but the contracts must be ratified by the board itself or they will not be valid . Where , on the other hand , all the terms of a contract have  | been definitely agreed on by the board at a legal meeting , the ministerial duty of executing the contract or reducing it to the proper form may be delegated to an agent . An Oregon case is in point . A superintendent employed a teacher to perform the duties of another teacher who had become ill . She taught for three and one-half years , after which she was discharged . At the time of her alleged employment there was a statute in force to the effect that regularly employed teachers should be put on the permanent list after two years of service . There was also in force a statute which provided that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called for that purpose , shall hire teachers , and shall make contracts with such teachers which shall specify the wages , number of months to be taught , and time employment is to begin , as agreed upon by the parties , and shall file such contracts in the office of the district clerk . " The discharged teacher brought action for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to restore her to her position . This the court refused to grant for the following reasons . The manifest purpose and spirit of the statute , and the only reasonable construction that can be given it , is that the relation of teacher can not be created except by a written contract embodying the terms prescribed by the statute . The duty thus imposed upon the board is not delegable . The directors have been elected by the people to perform a duty requiring their judgment . It is not a ministerial function which may be performed by another . The plaintiff had no right to rely upon the action of the superintendent as a basis of service in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the permanently employed teachers . A knowledge of the law is imputed to her . There is no such thing as apparent scope of authority in one professing to act as agent for a public municipality of which the powers and their manner of exercise are so strictly and minutely defined by statute . The law prescribes the scope and extent of the authority of those acting for the district , and no one can conceal himself behind the camouflage of apparent authority . At her peril she depended upon her transactions with the superintendent , who really had no authority and , if he had , could not and did not exercise it as the law requires . Other courts have applied the same principle . In Massachusetts a statute authorized the town of Marblehead to designate a schoolhouse site . In town meeting the selectmen were authorized to select a suitable site , and they undertook to do so . The court held that  | they acted without authority , for the selection of a site was " a discretion the town itself must use and can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ authorized school boards to issue anticipation warrants drawn against taxes levied but not collected . A board authorized its finance committee to " borrow such sums as are necessary . " The committee without further authority borrowed $25,000 from a bank on the warrants of the district . The court held that the warrants had not been legally issued . It also appears that the resolution delegated to the finance committee the power to determine the amount of money to be raised by the sale of warrants . Without question , it was the intention of the Legislature , as well as in accordance with sound public policy , that , before issuing these warrants , the authority should be expressly granted by the entire board and the particular tax to be anticipated should be definitely fixed and determined by the official action of the board In a New York case , two of the three trustees of a school district levied a school tax at a meeting of which the third trustee had no notice ; but , when the warrant of assessment was carried to the absent trustee , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not legal , the court said : Worden could not delegate his authority to the other two trustees to make the assessment . Neither could he , after they had made it , ratify and adopt the assessment or apportionment by indorsing his approval in the absence of the others . The authority which the trustees are required to administer in apportioning this tax involves the exercise of judgment and discretion ? a power which can not be delegated . Similarly , in Tennessee , a board of school directors agreed among themselves that each director should employ the teacher for his subdistrict . Contracts made pursuant to this agreement were not enforceable . We are of the opinion said the court that the law required the directors to act together as a board . They can not delegate to each other performance of a duty cast upon them by law . The law requires that three shall be elected and  | each director must exercise his own will and purpose in person . Those who elect him are entitled to this . Finally , in Illinois a contract between a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ state normal school whereby the two boards would jointly exercise control over certain schools to be used for practice teaching was held void because the local school board could not delegate to another powers and discretion vested by law in itself . School boards may , on the other hand , delegate to their agents the performance of purely administrative or ministerial duties . Where , for example , a board at a regular meeting voted to purchase a certain site for a schoolhouse at a stipulated price and authorized the president to pay the price and receive the deed for the property , there was no unwarranted delegation of discretion . The power delegated to the president was wholly ministerial.si Similarly , in New Jersey a committee of a board of education was delegated the duty of inviting proposals and submitting specifications with respect to school desks . Although the resolution awarding the contract was adopted in due form by the board itself , it was contended that the duties performed by the committee were of such a character as to render the final action of the board merely perfunctory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , the power to purchase is only ministerial or administrative , it may be delegated to a committee of the corporate body created for the purpose , .... and , even where such corporate action is necessary , the fact that the negotiations have been conducted by a committee for that purpose will not invalidate the resolution awarding the contract provided the result of such negotiation is first reported to the corporate body and there discussed and considered before final actions '  | Not only may a school board not delegate its discretionary powers ; it may not limit them by contract5. , or by previous agreement.54 A South Carolina case55 is precisely in point . There was need for a new school building in the city of Gaffney . The board appointed a committee to make inquiries , to report as to the best location , and to circulate a petition for an election on the question of issuing bonds to purchase a site . It was claimed that , in circulating the petition , the committee assured those who signed it that the new building would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if this representation had not been made , the bonds would not have been voted . The board contended that , if such representation was made , it was made without its authority . After the bonds had been voted and the money was in hand , the board decided to erect the building near the business center of the city . Action was brought to enjoin the board from locating the building on the lot finally designated . The injunction was denied . Assuming , then , as we must for the purpose of this inquiry , that the representations were made with the effect alleged , the question is : Should that preclude the trustees from now exercising the judgment and discretion vested in them by law to locate the building where they believe it ought to be located to best subserve the educational interests of the district as a whole ? Or , stating the proposition differently , must they now , because of those representations , abuse their discretion by locating the building where , in their judgment , it will not be for the best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the statute and their oath of office , to exercise their discretion and judgment , in the language of the statute ( Civ . Code , Sec. 1761 ) " so as best to promote the educational interests of their district . " This power and duty is continuing and inalienable . They could not , therefore , bind themselves by promises or representation so as to divest themselves of the right to a free and untrammeled exercise of their judgment and discretion for the best interests of their district at the time they were required to act as a body . They may have thought , when the representations were made , that it would be best to locate the building in the west end ; but , upon further consideration of the matter , in the light of new reasons suggested by some of their body or others , they may have changed their minds ; if so , they not only had the power , but it was their duty to themselves and to the  | district , to do so . It would be contrary to public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ duty of exercising their judgment and discretion for the benefit of the whole district to bind or fetter themselves by promise or representation to individuals or to electors of a section of the district so that they could not , at all times , act freely and impartially for the benefit of the whole district . The power was conferred upon them for public purposes , and it could not be lawfully bartered away to influence signatures to the petition or votes in the election . The electors are presumed to have known this . Therefore , they had no legal right to rely upon the alleged representations or to be influenced by them in signing the petition or in voting in the election .  | It is an elementary principle of law that all members of a corporate body who are entitled to participate in the conduct of its affairs must be given actual or constructive notice of all corporate meetings . School-district meetings , therefore , are not legally constituted unless they are called in strict conformity with statutory requirements . ' In the case of Lander v. School @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a district meeting held without notice it was voted to borrow money with which to build a schoolhouse . The money was borrowed and the schoolhouse built , but the district was not held liable under its contract . The court said : " There does not appear to have been any notice of the meeting given to the inhabitants of the district . The meeting not having been legally called , the district could not be bound by its action , it was altogether inoperative and void . " It has been held that a notice of six days where the law requires seven is , in effect , no notice at al1 . The notice , moreover , must stipulate definitely the time and the place of meeting , and , if the meeting is a special one , the business to be transacted must be indicated with clearness and particularity . Action at such meetings must be con- fined strictly to those matters which the electors have been called together to consider . It is not necessary , however , that the notice be drawn up in formal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that it should be so expressed that the inhabitants of the district may fairly understand the purpose for which they are to be convened . " All district meetings must be held , moreover , at the time and the place provided for in the notice ; if there is a change of place , all those entitled to participate must be given a reasonable opportunity to attend . By way of illustration , a town meeting in Maine was called to assemble at 1:30 P.M. in a schoolhouse . Six or eight of the inhabitants assembled at the time designated , but , as there was snow on the ground and the schoolhouse was locked and they had no key , the meeting was called to order in the road and promptly adjourned to a store about a mile away . No precaution was taken to inform any of the other inhabitants that the meeting was being held at the store . Later in the afternoon other inhabitants came to the schoolhouse but , finding no indication of a meeting , returned to their homes . The court held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and therefore not binding upon the town.6 In a very similar case , where a boy was stationed at the meeting place provided for in the notice to inform all who wished to attend that the meeting was being held a few blocks away , the court held that the action taken was legal and binding. ? It was not shown that anyone wishing to participate in the meeting was denied the opportunity to do so . As was said at the outset of this discussion , all those entitled to participate in school-district meetings must have actual or constructive notice . In the case of regular meetings , however , or those which are a matter of record , no special notice is required . The time appointed is presumed to be known by all , and it is their duty to attend without further notification . Formerly , school-district meetings were vested with much authority with respect to the management of the schools . As modern con- ditions have made it inconvenient or inadvisable for the people to conduct their affairs through direct participation , boards of education have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The same legal principles , however , which govern the calling of the district meetings are applicable to meetings of boards of education.9 Each member of such a board must have actual or constructive notice of all meetings , for the law contemplates that all be given an opportunity to attend , not only for the purpose of voting but for the purpose of offering counsel and advice . The law contemplates the combined judgment of all . It should be kept in mind , however , that board members have constructive notice of all regular meetings and that no further notification is necessary . " Under certain circumstances it is not necessary to give notice of board meetings . The courts seem to hold uniformly that , if all the members of a board of education are present and consent to act , lack of notice is immaterial . " As was said by the Supreme Court of North Dakota , " it is no doubt the law that in such a case , and where there is a failure to give the statutory notice , if all members of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board will be controlling . " The mere fact , however , that all the members of the board are present does not make the meeting legal . All must consent to take formal action . Where , for example , two of the three mem- hers of a board of trustees went to the home of the third to consider a contract with a teacher but the third member refused to discuss the matter , no binding contract could be entered into . While all must agree to act , it is not necessary that their action be unanimous , for , once the board is convened , the usual rules of procedure apply . There is considerable difference of opinion among the authorities as to what constitutes notice and how it may be given . In Arkansas it has been held that written notice is necessary . " Our statute , " said the supreme court of that state , " is silent on the question whether a notice of the call meeting of a municipal corporation shall be in writing . But we are of the opinion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given of such a meeting , it is contemplated that it shall be in writing . " Similarly , in North Dakota , where a statute required a written or printed notice , it was held that notice over the telephone , which the trustee denied receiving , was not sufficient . " The Supreme Court of Iowa , on the other hand , has held that written notice is not necessary unless required by statute and that a message delivered over the telephone that the board will meet at a certain time and place constitutes a legal notice . A statute of that state provided that special meetings might be held if a notice specifying the time and place were delivered to each member in person . One F. M. Sexton was notified by telephone of the time and the place of a meeting but failed to attend . The court held the notice sufficient . Notice by word of mouth may be delivered quite as effectually as one in writing . What this the statute exacts is that it actually reach the several members , so that each shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this purpose , oral notice would be as effective as written , and there is nothing in the context indicating that one was intended rather than the other . The same statute was later construed by the same court in the case of Independent School District of Switzer v. Gwinn . Notice of a board meeting was given by telephone to the wife of one of the  | members who was sick . She delivered the message prior to the time of meeting . The court held that the character of the notice and the manner of its delivery constituted sufficient compliance with the statute . Again , the question may arise as to whether the notice must be delivered in person or whether the requirements of the law are met by depositing written or printed notices in the mails . Where a statute requires that the notice shall be delivered in person , it has been held that notice by mail is not sufficient . In the case of Barclay v. School Township of Wapsinonoc , for example , on the day the clerk gave notice to the other members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one Anderson , a member , was not at home , though in fact he was . Thinking that Anderson could not be reached personally , the clerk mailed him a letter notifying him of the meeting . This letter Anderson never received . In fact , he left the state the next morning and did not return until after the meeting had been held . In the opinion of the court , the action taken at the meeting was illegal . The statute does not authorize a mailing of notice , and , in the absence of any such authority , we are unwilling to hold that an attempt to give notice by mail , which does not reach the member to be notified , is sufficient . It is sufficient to say that the statute does not provide that reasonable effort to give notice shall be sufficient . The personal delivery of some form of a notice is required . Ordinarily , however , it seems that notice by mail is considered good notice . In Arkansas , by way of illustration , all members of a school board @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been notified by mail three days previously . The court held the meeting legal 21 A Massachusetts statute authorized a city mayor to call a special meeting of the council by causing notice to be left at the usual place of residence of each member . Notice was given through the mail and received by all the members except one who had previously left the state on an extended visit to California . The court held that the requirements of the statute had been met   Where a school-board member is absent from the district and it is impracticable to give notice in the proper form , the service of the notice is waived . As has been said by the Supreme Court of New York : The object of notice is to give the person notified an opportunity to attend . There is no other virtue in the notice . Now when a person , elected as trustee , is at the time of his election in a distant State and continues there all the time until after the meeting in question , never having had any formal notice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that a meeting was made invalid by a failure to give him notice thereof . Must a personal notice be served on him in Minnesota ? Or if a notice left at his house is sufficient , of what use would it be to one who was beyond its reach ? It can not be necessary to do an act which , when done , would be of no use . By remaining where he could not attend the meetings of the board of education , Stone practically waived any notice of such meetings ; and indeed put it beyond the power of the proper officer to give any . ' 3 Whatever the form of the notice , it must , of course , be given by one having authority to call the board together . Moreover , each member of the board must be notified a reasonable time in advance . What is a reasonable time will be determined by the circumstances in each case . The rule is well settled that , when school boards are authorized to perform acts involving judgment and discretion , they can act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a body can not make a determination binding upon the district by their assent inch vidually and separately expressed . As was said by the Supreme Court of Kansas , " it is an elementary principle , that when several  | persons are authorized to do an act of a public nature , which requires deliberation , they all should be convened , because the advice and opinions of all may be useful , though all do not unite in opinion i6 Nor does it matter that all agree in the action taken , for the law contemplates that the board deliberate and counsel together . Authority is vested not in a designated number of persons but in the board as a corporate body . In the case of Herrington v. District Township of Liston , ' it was said : The question is here presented whether a corporation whose business is transacted by a board of directors can be bound by the assent of a majority of the directors to a contract , expressed otherwise than at a duly convened meeting . We are of the opinion that it can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the board will govern in the absence of a provision by statute , or in the articles of incorporation , requiring the concurrence of a greater number , yet their determination is valid only after the minority have had an opportunity to be heard . A board must act as a unit , and in the manner prescribed . The determination of the members individually is not the determination of the board . The same general principle of law is well stated in the case of McCortle v. Bates.29 Members of a township board of education acting in their individual capacity agreed to purchase apparatus for the township schools and to ratify the contract at their next meeting . The court held that such an agreement had no binding force : The members composing the board have no power to act as a board , except when together in session . They then act as a body or unit It will not be permitted to them to make any agreement among themselves , or with others , by which their public action is to be , or may be restrained or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The public , for whom they act , have the right to their best judgment after free and full discussion and consultation among themselves of , and upon , the public matters intrusted to them , in the session provided for by the statute . This can not be when the members , by preengagement , are under contract to pursue a certain line of argument or action , whether the same will be conducive to the public good or not . It is one of the oldest rules of the common law , that contracts contrary to sound morals , or against public policy , will not be enforced by courts of justice .  | A simple majority of a school board constitutes a legal quorum unless the statutes provide otherwise . Even where a statute authorizes a board of education to establish its own rules of procedure , the common-law quorum of a simple majority holds and can not be modified . The act of a majority of a quorum , whether fixed by common law or by statute , is the act of the board . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Supreme Court , " The general rule of all parliamentary bodies is that , when a quorum is present , the act of a majority of the quorum is the act of the body . This has been the rule for all time , except so far as in any given case the terms of the organic act under which the body is assembled have prescribed specific limitations . " Nor does it matter that there may be a vacancy in the board , for such a body does not lose its entity so long as there exists a legal quorum . Under all circumstances it is necessary , of course , that a quorum be present before a board undertakes the transaction of business . In the absence of any statutory regulation , a majority of the quorum , or of those present , is not necessary for the passage of a measure . If a quorum be present , a majority of those actually voting is sufficient to validate any measure under consideration. , , The courts adhere  | strictly to the rule that , where a quorum is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some members will not defeat the action of those actually voting . It is the duty of all members present to vote , and , if they fail to do their duty , they must be regarded as assenting to whatever the majority of those who do vote may determine . Those who may wish to defeat a measure must vote against it , for inaction will not accomplish their purpose . The case of Collins v. Janey is an excellent illustration of this principle of law . At a full meeting of a school board a contract was discussed , and , upon motion to adopt it , three members voted " Aye , " two " No , " and two did not vote . The chairman of the board was directed to execute the contract but refused to do so on the ground that it had not received the assent of a majority of the board members . The court held the contract valid on the theory that the two members who refused to vote must be regarded as having given their assent to the action taken by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case of Attorney-General v. Shepard , six of the seven members of a board of aldermen were present . Three voted for a measure , and the other three refused to vote . The court held that the measure had been carried . The same position has been taken by the Supreme Court of Indiana , where , in the election of a county superintendent of schools , three township trustees voted for one candidate and three refrained from voting . It should be kept in mind , however , that silence will not be construed as acquiescence under all circumstances . Where the statutes require affirmative action on the part of a majority of the board or a majority of those present , the measure under consideration must be positively supported by the required majority . A refusal to vote will not be considered as affirmative action The courts have frequently been called upon to determine the effect of blank ballots cast at an election . The weight of authority  | is that such ballots are a nullity . They can not be counted for or against any candidate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ number of ballots cast at an election . In its very nature a vote is an expression of a choice of candidates or measures . One who casts a blank ballot merely registers his refusal to vote , and the only importance which attaches to such a ballot is that it reveals an intent to concur in whatever measure may be determined upon by those actually voting . In the case of Attorney-General v. Bichford , as an illustration , a school committee met to elect a superintendent of public instruction for the city . The result of the ballot was : C. W. Bickford , five votes ; John Smith , two votes ; John Doe , one vote ; and two votes were blank . The chairman declared that no election had taken place , but Bickford claimed the office . The court sustained Bickford 's contentention because the blank ballots were not expressive of a choice and were without effect in determining the result of the contest . The argument that such a ballot indicates a purpose of the voter to register his refusal to vote for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indicative of his purpose to concur in the result which the regular ballots dis close . It is difficult to see how it has any more effect upon the result than a refusal to vote , which is regarded , so far as it is important , as an acquiescence in the result . It has no negative effect . What the voter 's purpose was is not apparent . To the same effect is the opinion of the court in the case of Murdoch v. Strange . The mayor and the city council of Annapolis , Maryland , voted to elect a market master . Strange received four votes , Murdoch three , and there was one blank ballot . The court held that Strange had been elected because at common law a blank ballot is not to be counted in estimating the number of ballots cast . To call a blank piece of paper a ballot would be a misnomer . " It is  | in fact nothing ; it can not be expressive of any intention ; no rule or method of interpretation can relieve it of its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hold . It has been held in Minnesota that , where the law requires a majority of the " votes cast " in order to carry a proposition , blank ballots must be considered in determining the fact of majority So , too , in Ohio , " if it is required by law that a majority , or any certain proportion of the votes cast at the election , should be in favor of a proposition in order that it should carry , then all the votes cast at the election , including blank and unintelligible ballots , must be considered . " At any time before rights to third parties have vested , a board of education has authority to rescind any action which it may have taken . Where , for example , the inhabitants of a district voted to raise money for the erection of a schoolhouse , they had the right to rescind the vote at their discretion at any time prior to the levy of the taxes.g6 It has been held , too , that a resolution adopting a uniform system of schoolbooks may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vote was taken . In Massachusetts it has been held that the election of a superintendent of schools may be rescinded at an adjourned meeting which was in legal effect a continuation of the original meeting . It seems , however , that in this case the superintendent was never notified of his election . Moreover , the revocation of a former action need not be formal nor done in express terms . The doing of an act wholly inconsistent with an earlier act constitutes a valid revocation . The regulations and by-laws of a board of education made under statutory authority have the force of law and are binding even upon  | the board itself where rights to third parties have accrued.5 ? A case in point is that of United States v. Callahan.51 Under a rule of the Board of Education of the District of Columbia , a teacher might be granted a leave of absence for a year provided she filed a pledge with the superintendent to teach in the schools of the district for a period of at least two years after the expiration of the leave @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of absence to one Otelia Cromwell in order that she might pursue a course of study in Yale University . She failed to file the required pledge but was assured by the assistant superintendent that she would be permitted to return to her position . The teacher next on the eligible list claimed that this failure to file a pledge as the rule required created a vacancy in the position held by Otelia Cromwell and sought a writ of mandamus requiring the board to appoint her to the place thus made vacant . The writ was granted by the Court of Appeals of the District of Columbia for the following reasons : While it may be conceded that the board might exercise the power of appointment in any reasonable manner it might deem proper to adopt , it has in its wisdom elected to exercise this power through certain rules and regulations which it has adopted and promulgated . Being empowered by the act of Congress to make such rules and regulations , they must be deemed to have the force and effect of law , unless they are in conflict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are binding upon the respondents in the matter of appointing and promoting teachers We think that , if the rules of the board are to be given the force of law , a teacher , obtaining a leave of absence to pursue a postgraduate course of training , must comply strictly with the letter of the rule , in order to retain her position in competition against others who would otherwise be entitled to the position vacated . The assistant superintendent , moreover , had no authority to ignore the rules of the board , " nor indeed could the board itself abrogate its own rules , to meet the exigencies of a single case , and certainly not to the detriment of a right which had accrued . " The same position has been taken by the Court of Appeals of Kentucky . The Board of Education of the city of Louisville  | adopted a rule that no purchase of supplies should be made in excess of five hundred dollars except upon bids previously advertised for and accepted . Notwithstanding this rule , a contract was entered into for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without any bids having been received . Later the board refused to execute the contract . Said the court : We are only concerned with the effect of the rules and by-laws adopted by public corporations to enable them to better carry out the purpose of their creation and existence , and we have no doubt that the material reasonable rules and by-laws of a public corporation made and adopted in pursuance of legislative authority and within the scope of the powers of the public corporation to aid it in the discharge of its public duties , have the same binding force and effect upon it and all persons with whom it does business as the statute under which it derives its powers . The court pointed out , moreover , that persons dealing with a municipal corporation are bound at their peril to know that all contracts must be made in the mode appointed by the charter and ordinances . If they fail to observe the rules and regulations of a school board , for example , they must suffer the consequences . The same principle of law was involved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ diploma to a pupil who would not wear a cap and gown at the graduating exercises , as the board required . In issuing a writ of mandamus that the diploma be granted , the court pointed out that the board had prescribed an approved course of study and had provided that the honors of graduation and diplomas should be conferred upon all who completed it . Since the rules established by the board became the law for the government of the school , the board , under its own rule , would be compelled to grant a diploma to any pupil who had met the requirements . It should be added , perhaps , that the rule with respect to the wearing of caps and gowns was held unreasonable and therefore void s3 It has been held , however , that , under certain conditions , a board may ignore its own rules and regulations . This may be done , it seems , where no rights have accrued to third parties or where the rule has to do merely with parliamentary procedures , In the case of  |p1158  Weatherly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that , although a rule was in force requiring all applications for teaching positions in the schools to be made in writing , the unanimous election of a teacher who had made no such application was valid . If the board saw fit by unanimous vote to ignore the rule , it could not later repudiate the contract because the rule had not been complied with . In a somewhat similar case , 56 the Board of Education of the city of San Francisco had a regulation that any rule adopted by the board might be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of three members , provided notice in writing of such intended amendment or repeal had been given at a previous meeting . This regulation was ignored in amending a rule relating to teachers ' absences . The court held that the rule in question was merely one of parliamentary procedure and might be suspended as occasion required . In any event , the board members alone had the right to complain . The St. Louis Board of Education had a rule that all school building contracts should @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ advertised for bids for the erection of a schoolhouse but reserved the right to reject any or all bids . The lowest bidder was not awarded the contract ; nevertheless , the court held he had no cause of action . " Whatever its rules or practices as to acceptance of bids may have been , plaintiffs ' rights can not be justly held to be greater than those conferred by the  | published advertisement on which their bid was made . " In Kansas a board rule read : " At the regular meeting in March of each year the board of education shall elect , by ballot , a superintendent of schools . " At a special meeting in February a superintendent was elected on motion and not by ballot . In holding the election valid , the court said : It would be carrying technicalities to the extreme , however , to hold that a board of education might not by common consent waive its rule requiring an election of a superintendent to be held by ballot , and signify its choice by a call of the members @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we think , to say that the election of a superintendent at a meeting of the board called for that purpose should be held invalid merely because the board had previously adopted a rule fixing a regular and later meeting as the time for selecting a superintendents ' Not infrequently a statute provides that school boards shall take certain action on or before a stipulated date . As a rule , such statutes are regarded as directory only , and , unless there is some provision expressly prohibiting the taking of the action in question after the expiration of the prescribed date , a board may act within any reasonable time . " A Pennsylvania statute , for example , required school directors to levy the annual tax for school purposes on or before the first Monday in May . In a caseeo testing the authority of the directors to levy the tax at a later date , the supreme court used the following language : Here is a positive duty , enjoined by express legislative enactment The school directors of Rush township were enjoined , by law , to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ May . The act of Assembly is directory as to the time ,  | and if by accident , or from any other cause , this duty was omitted , it could be performed in any reasonable time thereafter . Similarly , in the case of Hendershot v. State , ' it was said by the Supreme Court of Indiana : For the most excellent reason , it seems to be held by the courts everywhere that when a duty is imposed by statute upon public officers which affects the rights or duties of others , and the time of its performance designated , the officers will not be relieved of the duty by their failure to perform on the date specified , unless the language of the statute is such that the designated time must be accepted as a limitation of the officers ' power . In the absence of words of limitation , the prescribed time of performance will be regarded as directory only , and the duty to perform a continuing one subject to mandamus , by the party in interest , within a reasonable period . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whereas the time of taking the action is directory only . Obviously , public policy commonly demands that the prescribed action be taken . While the law-making body may desire that it be taken within certain time-limits , to hold that it must be taken within those limits or not at all would often prove socially disastrous . Like all similar bodies , a school board has the power , if unrestricted by statute , to adjourn a regular meeting to such time and place as it deems expedient , and , unless such adjournment is an abuse of power , it is not subject to review . ' Difficulty sometimes arises , however , as to what constitutes adjournment . " An adjournment is an act , not a declaration . It is an act of separation and departure , and , until this takes place , the adjournment is not cornplete. " 63 In the case of Gallagher v. School Township of Willow , " a motion to adjourn had been passed and one or two of the members may have departed , although a quorum still remained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the court sustained their action . Similarly , it has been held that , although an adjourn- ment of court had been announced and the judges had risen to go , the court was still in session and could receive a verdict.65 Nor does the fact that one-half of the members of a board refuse longer to participate in the meeting constitute an adjournment if they remain in the room where the business is being transacted . In an Indiana case , six township trustees met on the first Monday in June , as provided by statute , to elect a county superintendent of schools . They balloted 236 times without consummating an election , and at midnight three of the trustees withdrew and joined the group of spectators in the room . Three votes were then cast for one candidate , and he was declared elected . The legality of the proceeding was tested in the supreme court , which held that the three trustees who attempted to withdraw were still present . They could not change from trustees to mere spectators so long as they remained in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the arrival of the hour of midnight operate ipso facto to work an adjournment While boards of education should keep records of their proceedings , it is not necessary that they do so in the absence of a statute to that effect 6q It has been held , for example , that failure to keep a formal record of a board meeting at which a pupil was expelled does not render the action void.68 In Indiana an order of a township trustee discontinuing a school was held valid although the trustee failed to record the order at the proper time 69 Even where a statute required a record of all orders and proceedings , a board rule excluding children under seven years of age unless they entered school within  | four weeks after the opening of the fall term was not void because not entered upon the minutes . In the case of Russell v. Lynnfield , " it was said : The school committee are required to have general charge and superintendence of all the public schools in the town , and to keep a record of their votes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that all rules and orders required for the discipline and good conduct of the schools shall be matter of record . Nor may a contract entered into with a school board be repudiated merely because no record of the transaction was kept ; " this is true even though the statutes require the clerk to keep minutes of each meeting . As a rule , it is not necessary that the minutes of school-board meetings be formal or technical . As was said in the case of Kinney v. Howard , " too strict rules should not be adopted with reference to records of the proceedings of school boards . They are usually kept by persons not versed in the law , and are generally quite informal in character . If they show the action in fact taken , although not conveniently or formally expressed , they should be held sufficient . " Similarly , the Supreme Court of Nebraska has said with reference to a resolution authorizing the purchase of a schoolhouse site : " The records and proceedings of school district meetings are not to be given a narrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a manner as to give effect to the manifest intention of the voters , if the same can be ascertained from the records . " Where , for instance , a clerk made a minute on a piece of paper but failed to transcribe it into the record book because of sickness , the court held the minute was sufficient to indicate the action taken  | Sufficient , too , is a record kept on sheets of paper clipped or pinned into the record book ? ' Even where a statute made it the duty of the secretary of the district to record all the proceedings of the board and of district meetings in separate books kept for that purpose , records kept on half-sheets and quarter-sheets of paper not bound in book form were held to be sufficient . The court was unwilling to declare void all the proceedings of the district because the statute had not been technically followed . It preferred to regard the statute as directory As a general rule , statutes requiring that school-board records show the " yeas " and " nays " are mandatory @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will not suffice 8o There are two reasons why the letter of such legislation is enforced . It is the evident policy of the state that the records show how each individual member of the board voted so that the public may know where to place responsibility . A record showing a unanimous vote does not indicate which members were present at the time the vote was taken . Moreover , where it is merely recorded that a measure was unanimously adopted , there is no way to ascertain whether a quorum was present at the time . To illustrate , a Kentucky statute provided that boards of education could enter into contracts only with the consent of a majority of the members elected and that the " yeas " and " nays " be entered upon the record . In holding that a minute which stipulated that a certain contract had been entered into by a unanimous vote was not sufficient , the court said : It is true the minutes show that at the opening of the board there were present a sufficient number of the members to constitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the acceptance of the bank 's proposition the requirements of the statute would be substantially complied with But it does not follow that , because there was a statutory quorum at the opening of the board , all these members remained until the proposition of the bank came up for  | acceptance or rejection . Common experience teaches that the contrary is usually true . The members of deliberative bodies come and go , and often , when there is not a call for the " yeas and nays , " business is transacted with less than a quorum present . It has been held , however , that , where the record shows that all the members of the board were present and all voted affirmatively , the " yeas " and " nays " were effectively recorded . So , too , it has been held that the " yeas " and " nays " were not required by a statute which provided that " each motion , with the name of the person making it and the vote thereon , shall be entered on the record . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " was deemed suffi-cient8a Ordinarily , the official records of a public corporation are prima facie evidence of the action taken by that corporation . Such a body speaks through its records 8q Few of the rules of evidence are more commonly accepted or have a wider application than that which declares that parol or extrinsic evidence is inadmissible to contradict , vary , or subtract from the official records of a public body , such as a board of education . ' If incorrect minutes are kept , the remedy lies in having them corrected at that or some subsequent meeting 86  | In the case of Cowley v. School District No. 3 , " a teacher claimed that she had been employed by the board at a legal meeting and sought to prove it by the testimony of a majority of the members of the board . The official record of the proceedings of the meeting stated that " the application of Miss Cowley for the next term of school was presented by Mr. Wilson , but no action was taken . " The court rejected such testimony @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that it would contradict the official records . The same principle of law is well illustrated by an old case in Massachusetts 88 The district clerk was authorized by the district , as the records showed , to call the annual meetings . He called a special meeting , and the action taken thereat was later questioned in the courts . The court rejected evidence to establish the fact that the clerk had been authorized to call all district meetings . Such evidence , it was said , would be a direct contradiction of the record . A similar conclusion was reached by the Supreme Court of Errors of Connecticut when it stated : " The intention of a corporation can be ascertained only by the language of its recorded acts ; and neither the private views nor the public declarations of individual members of such corporation can , for this purpose , be enquired into . " The rule of law , however , which excludes parol or extrinsic evidence to vary or change official records is subject to a degree of flexibility and a considerable number of exceptions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a board of education may not be supplemented or explained by parol evidence where such minutes are indefinite or obscure in meaning ? ? A good example of how far the courts will go in permitting the introduction of oral evidence to clear up an ambiguous record is the case of Westerman v. Cleland . The minutes of a county board of education read : " July 3d , Ukiah High School . Principal , P. B. Westerman , $1,500 . " Westerman acted as principal for nine months and was paid $150 a month , and then the  | school was closed . He brought suit to recover an additional $150 . The court permitted the board of education to introduce evidence to show that it had not employed Westerman for a term of ten months nor at a salary of $150 a month for the time taught . The opinion of the court is , in part , as follows : If the minute entry of July 3 , 1906 , had stated what is claimed in the complaint ? that plaintiff was employed for one year to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by appellant that the minutes could not be impeached or contradicted might be considered . The minute entry , however , fails to import on its face such a contract as is claimed for it , or , indeed , any contract at all , and it was competent for defendants to show what the contract was ? not as contradicting the minutes , but as explanatory thereof . Parol or extrinsic evidence is admissible to supply omissions in the records of a board of education . Action taken at a lawful meeting will not be rendered void because of failure to make a record of it . This is especially true where rights accrue to third parties as a result of board action . If this were not the case , such corporations as cities or school districts might escape liability upon their contracts simply through failure to make a record of them . A case in point is that of German Insurance Company v. Independent School District of Milford 94 A school board authorized its president to insure the school buildings , but the clerk failed to make any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the president acted without authority , and the records of the board were offered as evidence . In holding that the facts as to what actually occurred at the meeting in question  | might be established by the testimony of those present , the court used the following language . This action of the board was part of its business at that meeting , and should have been recorded . But it was the vote of the directors which gave authority to the president to act on behalf of the district , and the negligence of the clerk in failing to record the action of the board could not nullify that authority . Had the clerk made the record , it would have been competent evidence , and the best evidence , of the action of the board . But , as he failed to make such record , the fact could be proven by the persons present . So , too , it has been held that action taken by a school board in employing a teacher may be established by parol evidence in the absence of any record 95 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 96 the Supreme Court of Illinois permitted the fact to be established that a board of education had approved the bond of its treasurer although the matter was not mentioned in the minutes . A contract between a school board and an attorney has been sustained in the absence of any official record of the transaction . Where the minutes of a district meeting showed that a certain motion had been adopted but did not show what motion , the court permitted parol evidence to establish the fact that the building of a new schoolhouse had been authorized . That parol evidence is admissible to supply omissions in the records of school boards seems to be a common and widely accepted principle of law . The rule as thus broadly stated , however , is subject to certain exceptions . Where the statutes require that the acts and proceedings of school boards appear of record , in some jurisdictions parol evidence is inadmissible to supply omissions , for the record is the only evidence . In other jurisdictions the mere fact that a statute requires that records of acts and proceedings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extrinsic evidence to supply omissions .  | Undoubtedly , the better principle of law is that parol or extrinsic evidence may be introduced to supply omissions in official records unless the statutes expressly provide that the records be the only and exclusive evidence of board action . ' In the case of School Directors v. Kimmel , for example , a statute provided that the school directors should appoint a clerk who should keep a " record of all the official acts of the board in a well-bound book . " Nevertheless , the court ruled : The statute does not make the record kept by the clerk the only evidence of the action of the directors , and unless the law expressly and imperatively requires all matters to appear of record , and makes the record the only evidence , parol proof is admissible to prove things omitted to be stated on the record . Dillon on Municipal Corporations , sec. 237 . While a corporation can only enter into a contract at a regular or special session of its board of directors , it does not follow that only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used as evidence to prove that a contract was entered into . The Supreme Court of Indiana has said : It has been a rule in this State for more than fifty years that a record is but the evidence of the fact recorded . The fact ordinarily exists independently of the record , and when there is no provision that it shall be provable only by the record , the same , upon failure of the record , may be established by parol . So in this case , if there had been no record at all , the want of it would not have invalidated the election , and the same might have been proved by parol evidence ' A school board may amend its records so as to make them speak the truth . As was said by the Appellate Court of Illinois : If the record truthfully states the facts and all of the facts then by this record the official acts of the board are to be determined . If the record does not state any of the facts , or does not recite all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  | statute does not make the record kept by the clerk the only evidence of the action of the board . If the record does not correctly state the facts , the directors have a right to amend the record to make it correctly show all of the proceedings This is the limit of the power of the board to amend their records . The board is without authority to amend their records to suit their pleasure , or convenience , or to set up a state of facts which never existed . If the record truthfully shows an employment and that a contract was entered into , the board is without authority to amend the record so as to show that no contract in fact was entered into . After an amendment , if there is any omission and the record does not show all of the facts , parol evidence is admissible to show the omission . It has been held , moreover , that a board of education may amend its minutes even though there has been a change in its personnel . In an Illinois case , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to changing district boundaries , but the clerk did not accurately record the proceedings . Twice thereafter the minutes were amended , once after a change in the personnel of the board . The court sustained the amendment on the ground that authority to make it depended not on the personal recollection of the individual members but on the knowledge of the clerk as to what actually happened . While the records of the proceedings of school boards may be amended so as to make them speak the truth , this can not be done to the prejudice of third parties ; that is , if third parties have acted in reliance on the truth of the record and private rights have accrued , the record can not be changed , IO6 or , if changed , the corporation will be estopped from taking advantage of the amendment ' ' , Obviously , the fundamental attribute of a record is verity , and those who deal with a public corporation should not be required to look farther than the official account of its proceedings . As was said by the Supreme @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be altered or amended in accordance with facts found upon the testimony of witnesses , after individuals have dealt with the  | town and invested their money , or performed labor upon the faith of the vote as recorded , would produce the same mischief as if no record were required . No one could safely engage in transactions with a town , or with its special agents , without first ascertaining the accuracy of the record . In attempting to do this , the same difficulty would be met as if there were no record . " $ In fact , a record not conclusive until proved to be right might be worse than no record at all . In many instances its only effect would be to mislead and confuse .  | It is beyond the scope of this work to treat at any length the general subject of contracts . Under the common law , however , there are certain essential elements common to all simple contracts and these can not be ignored , of course , by boards of education or parties dealing with them . These @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the part of the contracting parties ; ( 2 ) mutual assent of the contracting parties to the terms of the contract , or what is commonly known as a meeting of the minds ; ( 3 ) a valid consideration ; ( 4 ) rights and liabilities sufficiently definite to be enforceable ; and ( 5 ) an agreement of such a nature as not to be prohibited by the statutes or the common law . The question of the legal capacity of the contracting parties does not frequently arise in relation to school contracts . The question of mutual assent , on the other hand , may arise in connection with any contract . It is often difficult to determine what constitutes mutual assent or when it has been given . It is impossible to formulate any general principle or criterion for the determination of mutual assent ; each case must stand on its own merits . Perhaps the greatest difficulty in this connection grows out of the fact that acts or conduct intended by one party to constitute a mere preliminary step toward a proposal or acceptance are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or acceptance . This difficulty is well illustrated in an Iowa case . A school district advertised for bids for the erection of a schoolhouse , requiring a certified check to accompany each bid . Nothing was said with respect to the purpose of such requirement . The board reserved the right to reject all bids . One Fisher was the lowest bidder . The board voted to award him the contract and instructed its secretary to telegraph him to that effect . The secretary sent a telegram to Fisher which read , " You are low bidder . Come on  | morning train . " When Fisher arrived he informed the board members informally that he had made a mistake in his bid amounting to some fifteen hundred dollars . Thereupon , the board members stated that they desired to change the specifications by providing for somewhat more expensive material . Fisher then made a corrected bid to cover the mistake and the additional cost of material . The board then went into formal session at which the contract was awarded to a lower bidder . A resolution was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the basis of his bid and that his check for five hundred dollars be forfeited to the district . The board proceeded upon the theory that there was a completed contract which Fisher refused to join in reducing to written form . To this the court would not give its assent . The action as in fact taken by the board , considered by itself , can not be permitted to control the situation . Until communicated to Fisher , it amounted to no more than the forming of a conclusion to accept of his bid and to enter into contracts with him . It is not enough to determine upon an acceptance , but that determination must be communicated to the other party . This is elementary ; but see 9 Cyc . Law and Proc. , p. 270 , and the cases cited . So , too , it is plain that the telegram can not be given the effect of an acceptance of the bid of Fisher , and so give rise to contract relations , as contended by appellants . It served no other purpose than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his bid was the lowest , and that further consideration or arrangement awaited his appearance in response to the invitation to come . It has frequently been held that a message similar in wording to the one in question is not sufficient . ' Moreover , the court pointed out that there was no express provision for a forfeiture in the notice for bids , and that the law would not imply that such was intended . The case of Fairplay School Township v. O'Neal2 illustrates the necessity of formulating a contract in terms sufficiently definite as to be enforceable . In that case it was held that a contract to pay a teacher " good wages " was not enforceable because of indefiniteness of consideration . Nor are teachers ' contracts enforceable where the  | term of employment is not definitely stipulated . Contracts between a board of education and one of its own members are examples of contracts which are unenforceable as contravening public policy and the principles of common law . Boards of education are limited not alone by the general principles of the law of contracts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their authority . School districts are merely quasi-corporations authorized by the state to exercise limited governmental functions . They can exercise only such powers as are expressly or impliedly conferred upon them by statute , or such as necessarily grow out of the purposes of their creation . Parties dealing with school boards should keep in mind the distinction between the contractual authority of a private individual and of a public corporation . Private parties are free to incur contractual obligations so long as they do not violate some positive mandate of law or public policy , or unless they are barred from contracting by some incapacity , such as being a minor or insane . There is , on the other hand , no inherent power to contract in such quasi-corporations as school districts . Being arms of the state , created for the purpose of exercising purely governmental functions , the measure of their contractual power is found in the laws of the state and in them alone . Not only is a board of education limited by the statutes with respect to the subject matter of contracts ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statutory mode is the measure of power . " It is a principle settled by numerous decisions , " said the Supreme Court of Oregon , " that where a power is given to a corporation to do an act , and the particular method by which that power is to be exer-.  | cised is pointed out by the statute , the mode is the measure of power . In the absence of statutory provision that contracts with school boards be in writing , oral contracts are as valid as written ones . The only difference is that the terms of the oral contract may be more difficult to establish . Where , however , the statutes require contracts to be in writing , an oral contract is void . No recovery can be had on the contract , , nor , as a general rule , for the actual value of the goods furnished or services rendered . Such is the case , too , with respect to contracts made in violation of statutory provisions which require competitive bidding ? Moreover , where the statutes prescribe certain procedures in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the " yeas " and " nays , " such procedures must be followed or the contract will not be enforceable . ' " Usually , however , where there has been a substantial fulfilment of the statutory formalities , the courts will not suffer minor irregularities to invalidate the contract . Thus it has been held that where the terms of the contract have been fully agreed upon the contract need not be signed by the members of  | the school board at the same time and place . " Nor will failure to execute duplicate copies impair the validity of a contract . When contracts are brought into the courts for interpretation and enforcement , it frequently happens that one or both of the contracting parties may seek to introduce oral or other evidence not found in the written contract itself . It is important that boards of education and all who deal with them know to what extent and for what purposes such parol or extrinsic evidence is admissible . In courts of law parol evidence may be introduced to prove the existence of a simple contract , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ show that the document does not constitute a valid agreement because of mistake , fraud , illegality of object , or some other reason . But once the existence of a legal written contract is established , the courts will not admit parol or extrinsic evidence to contradict , vary , add to , or subtract from the meaning of the written document . ' , It is assumed that all previous discussions are merged into the written agreement and that it is an expression of the intent of the contracting parties . In a South Dakota case , for example , members of a school board purchased books from a publishing house and the contract was so written as to show on its face that it was the personal contract of the individual members . In defense to an action against the members of the board personally an attempt was made to show that in reality the contract was intended to bind the district . The court refused to admit parol evidence to establish the claim .  | It is a well-settled rule that parol evidence is inadmissible to vary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ writing , in the absence of fraud or mistake . The facts alleged in the answer , and proven on the trial , under the objections of the plaintiff , could have had no other effect , and could have been offered for no other purpose , than to contradict , vary , and impair the written instrument made by the defendants with the plaintiff ; and hence they were incompetent and inadmissible , and constituted no defense to the action . It may be that the defendants did not actually intend to bind themselves individually by the agreement executed by them . If so , it is unfortunate for them that they executed the instrument in its present form . This court , however , is unable to relieve them . It can only judge of the intent of the parties in executing written instruments by the form of the instrument itself , unless fraud or mistake is alleged and proven in obtaining it . Where , however , the contract is expressed in language so indefinite as to render its meaning doubtful , or where ordinary terms are used @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , parol evidence may be introduced to make the meaning clear . An English case is an excellent illustration of how far the courts will go in permitting parol evidence to be introduced in order to make clear the meaning of terms used in some special or technical sense . A lessee of a rabbit warren agreed to leave ten thousand rabbits on the warren . In interpreting the contract , it was said by the court : But here the ordinary meaning of the word " thousand " as applied to rabbits in the place where the contract was made , was one hundred dozen . The word " hundred " does not necessarily mean that number of units , for one hundred and twelve pounds is called a hundredweight ; so where that term is used with respect to ling or cod , it denotes six score ; and there being no precise meaning affixed by the legislature to the word " thousand " as applied to rabbits , I think the parol evidence was admissible to show that in the county where the contract was made the word @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The courts are slow , however , to admit parol evidence to clarify the meaning of a contract . Such evidence must tend to show the correct interpretation of the language used or it will be excluded . Its only purpose is to enable the court or the jury to reach an understanding of the language used in the contract . Evidence which tends to create rather than to construe a contract will be excluded , for the law will not do for a party that which he has not done for himself. , As a man contracts so is he bound . While the courts will seek to dis- cover the intent of the contracting parties as that intent is expressed in the written document , they will give no heed to previous or contemporary understandings which find no expression in the contract itself . Frequently boards of education misjudge their powers and attempt to enter into contracts which they have no authority to make . Such contracts are said to be ultra vires , that is , beyond the powers of the corporation . Few principles of law are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a public corporation , such as a school district , made in excess of authority are unenforceable and without effect . ' The fact that the school authorities may have themselves thought that they had authority to make the contract in question and may have so represented it to the other party is of no consequence . The doctrine upon which such contracts are held to be unenforceable is based upon the consideration that school districts are quasi-corporations with very limited powers . They are mere agents of the state for the better administration of an important public policy and possess only such contractual powers as are expressly or impliedly delegated to them . All are presumed to know the law and to determine for themselves the measure of authority which the state has seen fit to confer upon its subordinate agencies . Hence , one who misjudges the powers of a ' school district does so at his own peril . Even though the school district breach the contract and even though it retain the benefits of the performance of the contract by the other party , the courts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Whatever rights the other party to  | the contract may have , they do not grow out of the contractual relationship . The case of Powell v. Bainbridge State BankiB is a good illustration of the application of the principles stated in the foregoing paragraph . In that case a school board borrowed money from a bank despite the fact that the only statutory mode of borrowing money was by the issuance of bonds . Action was brought for a writ of mandamus to compel the board to repay the amount borrowed . The court refused the writ . If there is no warrant or authority of law for the trustees of a local school district , or more than one school district when consolidated , to borrow money except in the manner prescribed by law for the issuance of bonds , then the obligation can not be treated as an official obligation , and the creditors would be remitted to an individual personal liability altogether different from liability on the part of the board of trustees of the local school districts or of the consolidated school district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which must be repaid by the taxpaying public can not be implied . Such power rests upon an express grant , subject to such restrictions and limitations as the law making power may see fit to impose In our opinion , the board of trustees had no authority of law authorizing them to borrow money ; and , though the bank doubtless acted in the utmost good faith , an examination of the law would doubtless have created in the minds of its officers such a degree of caution as would have caused them to decline to make the loan . Similarly , where a school trustee purchased textbooks for the free use of pupils without specific statutory authority , the district was not bound to pay for them even though they were received and used by the pupils . ' 9 A school township can not be required to pay for reading-circle books purchased by the township trustee without statutory authority .  | For an act done by such school trustee not within the scope of his statutory power , and where he has no authority to act at all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is well settled in this state that persons contracting with school trustees are bound to know that their powers to contract are limited by statute , and that beyond such limit they can not go , and bind their townships ' . In some jurisdictions , however , it has been held that where an ultra vires contract has been fully executed and the corporation retains and enjoys the benefits thereof , the corporation is estopped to deny the want of power to make the contract . ' r The doctrine of ultra vires , it has been said , should not be permitted to work injustice and legal wrong . This is especially true where the contract is not one prohibited by law , or malum in se , or tainted with bad faith or fraud . " The question not infrequently arises as to whether parties dealing with a school district may invoke the doctrine of ultra vires . That is to say , is one who enjoys the benefits of an ultra vires contract estopped to deny the authority of the district to make it ? On this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decisions , which seem to express the better rule of law , it is held that limitations upon the contractual authority of public corporations are intended to protect the public and that private parties dealing with such corporations can not , while enjoying the benefits of a contract , set up the defense that the corporation was without authority to make it.24 In a recent Wisconsin case , 25 for example , the supreme court said : It is just as clearly established by the decisions of this court that persons who enter into a contract with the city stand in a different position from the city itself . Such persons " can not even make the defense of ultra vires or total lack of power on the part of the corporation to make the contract . " .... The limitations upon the authority of municipal officers to enter into contracts , and prescribed methods for the exercise of such power , are for the protection of the public , and such provisions will not be permitted to be invoked to the harm of  | the public by those who , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entered into contractual relations with a municipality . In other words , a law intended as shield for the public will not be permitted to be used as an instrument for its destruction . To the same effect is the case of Beloit v. Heineman z6 The city of Beloit rented a stone crusher to the defendant who refused to pay the rent and set up the defense that the city had no authority to make the contract . It was said by the court : Whatever limitations may have existed on the power of the town . . . . or its officers to confer upon an individual the right to use such machine , they are entirely immaterial to the defendant , who has actually enjoyed the privilege under an attempted contract . No limitation rested upon his ability or power to agree to pay for such use , and he , having received all the benefits of such a contract as if it were valid , can not now question its validity in order to repudiate his agreement to pay a price for that which he has received @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is one expressly prohibited by constitution or statute , it would seem that parties dealing with a school district should not be estopped to deny the validity of the contract . In Idaho , for instance , a constitutional provision made it illegal for a school district to take fire insurance with a county mutual fire insurance company . Nevertheless , such insurance was taken . In holding that the district could not recover from the company the court ruled as follows , citing Dillon on Municipal Corporations as authority : " Estoppel can not be invoked to prevent the denial of power in a municipal corporation to enter a contract which is expressly prohibited by a constitutional provision or statute . " 27 And in Arkansas , where a statute fixed a certain time for transacting the annual business of the school district and the meeting was held on a different day , a contract authorized by a vote of the meeting was void and no action could be maintained against the contractor for breach of the contract 2$ There is another class of contracts which school districts have authority @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certain conditions , or until certain preliminaries have been complied with . That  | is to say , the legislature has conferred the power to contract , but has also provided that the power can not exist until the performance of some prior act . Or it may be that the mode of contracting has been so definitely stipulated as to exclude all other modes . While contracts made in violation of the statutory requirements are , broadly speaking , ultra vires , they are so only in a secondary sense , and it is perhaps best to regard them merely as invalid contracts . Whatever their proper classification , contracts of this kind can not be enforced nor can recovery be had upon them for benefits received . In an Arkansas case , " for example , the statutes limited the annual expenditure of a school district for maps and charts to a sum not to exceed twenty-five dollars unless a larger amount was authorized at the annual election . It was also provided that the maps and charts must be approved by the state superintendent both as to price @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of both these requirements . The court refused to hold the district liable on warrants issued in payment of the charts , giving the following reasons : A school district is by the statutes of this State made a body corporate , but it is intended as an agency in administration of public functions . It is a quasi public corporation , and can exercise no powers beyond those expressly conferred by statute , or which arise therefrom by necessary implication . The powers and duties of the directors of a school district are derived only from legislative authority , and they can exercise no power that is not thus expressly or by necessary implication granted by statute . A contract entered into by the directors , therefore , which is beyond the powers conferred on them by statute to make is null and void And all persons who deal with the school officers are presumed to have full knowledge of the extent of the powers of these officers to make the particular contract . Similarly , where the statutes provided that a county board of education had no authority to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the county superintendent , a principal who had not been recommended could not recover for services rendered.3 ? So , too , in Indiana , where a statute required the township trustee to secure an order from the county commissioners before  | contracting an indebtedness , a contract made in disregard of the statute was unenforceable and no recovery could be had on the contract3 ' In the case of Keeler Brothers v. School District No. 3,3 ' the plaintiff entered into a contract with the board of education to purchase certain bonds of the district , but at the time the contract was made the statutory proceedings necessary to be taken by the board in order to authorize it to issue and deliver bonds had not been taken . The bonds were never delivered and the plaintiff sued for damages , claiming that it had gone to considerable expense as a result of the contract . The court held the contract invalid inasmuch as no proceedings had been taken to authorize the issuance of any bonds . Hence , no damages were allowed . Again , the statutes may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this is so , the mode of contracting is the measure of power . Contracts made otherwise can not be enforced33 It is commonly held , also , that contracts made in disregard of a statutory provision requiring competitive bidding are unenforceable , 36 and no recovery can be had upon them even though the district may retain the benefits conferred by performance on the part of the other party 35 In the case of Reams v. Cooley , 36 a contract for plastering was let without competitive bidding as the law required . In holding that the school district was not liable either on the express contract or upon an implied contract , the court expressed the rule as follows : But , while the doctrine of implied liability applies where general power to contract on a subject exists and the form or manner of doing so is not expressly provided by charter or statute , the decided weight of authority is to the effect that when by statute the power of the board or municipality to make a contract is limited to a certain prescribed method of doing so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ impliedly prohibited , no implied liability can arise for benefits received under a contract made in violation of the particularly prescribed statutory mode . Under such circumstances the express contract at-  | tempted to be made is not invalid merely by reason of some irregularity or some invalidity in the exercise of a general power to contract , but the contract is void because the statute prescribes the only method in which a valid contract can be made , and the adoption of the prescribed mode is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the exercise of the power to contract at all and can be exercised in no other manner so as to incur any liability on the part of the municipality . Where the statute prescribes the only mode by which the power to contract shall be exercised the mode is the measure of the power . A contract made otherwise than as so prescribed is not binding or obligatory as a contract and the doctrine of implied liability has no application in such cases It is urged in this case , as it invariably is in all such cases , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the school district may retain the benefit of the work of the contractor and be relieved of liability to compensate him therefor . But the provision of the law limiting the power of school boards to validly contract , except in a prescribed mode , proceeds from a consideration of public policy not peculiar to such boards , but adopted as the policy of the state with reference to inferior boards and public bodies , and it would be difficult to perceive what practical public benefit or result could accrue by legislative limitation or prohibition on the power of such bodies to contract if courts were to allow a recovery where the limitation or prohibition is disregarded . In fact , the plea of hardship urged here was answered in the Zottman case ( 20 Cal . 96 ) by language as pertinent now as it was then , where the court said : " It may sometimes seem a hardship upon a contractor that all compensation for work done , etc. , should be denied him ; but it should be remembered that he , no less than the officers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ expressly provided for in the charter , is bound to see to it that the charter is complied with . If he neglects this , or choose to take the hazard , he is a mere volunteer , and suffers only what he ought to have anticipated . If the statute forbids the contract which is made , he knows it , or ought to know it , before he places his money or services at hazard . " Some contracts are so defective that they are held to be absolutely void . Such a contract can not in any manner be ratified ; it is without any force or effect whatever and can not under any circumstance be made the basis of a cause of action . Speaking of such a contract , it was said by the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania : The law when appealed to will have nothing to do with it , but will leave the parties just in the condition in which it finds them . If they have fully executed t heir unlawful contract , the law will not disturb them in the possession @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has executed in whole or in part , the law turns a deaf ear when he pleads for its aid to compel the other to do as much 37  | Contracts clearly ultra vires , 38 or prohibited by statute , 39 or contrary to public policy4 ? are commonly held to be void . As indicated in the preceding paragraphs , express contracts of a quasi-corporation which are ultra vires or void can not be enforced , nor will the corporation be held liable on the contract even though it be fully performed by the other party and the corporation retain the benefits of the performance . While the corporation can not be held liable on the express contract , under certain circumstances it may , nevertheless , be held liable on an implied or quasi-contract . Frequently cases arise where a school district enjoys the benefits of goods or services furnished by other parties who are unable to recover upon an express contract but who should be entitled to recover upon principles of simple justice and equity . In such cases , it is said that one should not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and enjoy the benefits thereof without compensation ; one should not be permitted to enrich one 's self at the expense of another where it is possible that justice be done . There are three classes of simple contracts : ( 1 ) express contracts , ( 2 ) contracts implied in fact , and ( 3 ) contracts implied in law . Contracts implied in fact , like express contracts , are based upon agreement . The only difference is the evidence of the agreement ; in an express contract the agreement is evidenced by spoken or written words ; in a contract in fact it is evidenced by conduct . Offer and  | acceptance are implied as a fact from the acts of the parties and from the circumstances surrounding the case . A contract implied in law , on the other hand , is not based upon agreement ; it is a quasicontract . Logically it is not a contract at all because there is present no element of agreement whatever . In order to do justice the courts have adopted a fiction , namely , that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , like private parties , may be held liable where there is no express contract , but where a contract is implied in fact . If a school district receive and appropriate the property or services of another under such circumstances as would lead any reasonable person to believe that it intended to pay for the same , it will be held liable upon an implied contract , provided the property or services received are the proper subject matter of an express contract . Of course , there can not be an implied contract in fact unless the district had the authority in the first instance to make an express contract . That is , if the contract in question would have been ultra vires or void as an express contract , no contract in fact can be implied . Nor will mere acceptance of benefits create a contract implied in fact ; the circumstances must be such that an agreement may be reasonably inferred . The courts are frequently called upon to decide the liability of school districts on contracts implied in law , or quasi-contracts , as they are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be enforceable and recovery can not be had upon it even though it has been performed by one of the parties . It may be that it has been made in excess of the constitutional or statutory debt limit , or that it has not been made in writing as the law required . A member of a school board may contract with the board and after he has furnished the goods or services discover that he can not collect on the express contract . One may agree to transport pupils to and from school and keep his agreement only to discover that the district  | is not liable because it had no authority to make the agreement . Again , a school board may contract for goods or services which it had authority to contract for , but may have done so in such an irregular or illegal manner as to render the contract unenforceable . Under such circumstances , will the law disregard the express contract and create a fiction that the parties must have intended that the goods or services be paid for ? Where an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the parties , and the other party retains and enjoys the benefits thereof , under certain circumstances the law will imply a contract and permit a recovery upon a quantum meruit or quantum valebat . That is , the law will permit the party who has performed his agreement to recover the actual value of the services rendered or goods furnished . In this connection the Supreme Court of Michigan has said : But the doctrine has now grown up , based upon equitable principles , that where anything has been done from which the other party has received substantial benefit and which he has appropriated , a recovery may be had upon a quantum meruit , based upon that benefit . And the basis of this recovery is not the original contract , but a new implied agreement deducible from the delivery and acceptance of some valuable service or thing.44 The liability of school districts upon contracts implied in law is a close question . Since school districts have very limited powers and the mode of their exercise is often strictly prescribed , the courts not infrequently find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hand , they feel the necessity of giving full force and vigor to the limitations placed upon the exercise of power by the district , because such limitations and restrictions are designed to protect the public . On the other hand , the principles of simple justice and fair dealing may make it appear that the district , having retained and enjoyed the benefits of the goods furnished or services rendered by the other party , should be required to pay their actual worth . Indeed , some courts taking this latter view seem to have gone farther than equity warrants . Both reason and authority support the rule that where a school district is given general power to contract with respect to a subject matter , and the express contract made in pursuance of this power is invalid for some mere irregularity or invalidity in the execution  | thereof , the district will be held liable on a contract implied in law to pay for benefits received , provided the form or manner of entering the contract is not violative of any statutory restriction upon the authority of the district @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ noted , is not generally applicable to those contracts where the form and manner of contracting are prescribed by statute . Neither is it applicable where the statutes prescribe or prohibit the parties to the contract.g6 The principle of law involved here is well illustrated in a West Virginia case 47 Two members of a county court purchased from one Goshorn certain hogs for the use of the county poor farm . The court was not in session and no record was made of the transaction . Nevertheless , the hogs were delivered and consumed . When the bill for the hogs was presented to a regular session of the county court , it was not allowed in full , but the court voted to pay a lesser sum , which it considered just compensation . The controversy was carried to the supreme court which held that there could be no recovery on the express contract but that a recovery could be had upon quantum meruit . The original contract was invalid because not made by the court as such . It was , however , such a contract as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because prohibited by law , nor was the mode of entering it violative of any statutory provision . In the case of McCormick Lumber Company v. Highland School District , g8 the notices calling for a meeting of electors to consider erecting a new building were not posted the requisite length of time nor was there sufficient publication of notice calling for bids . Nevertheless , the board of trustees made a contract for the erection of the schoolhouse , and the building was completed and used . It was said by the court : The question presented is as to whether , admitting the informalities of notice in the calling of the meeting and advertising for bids for the construction of the  | building , the school district , having received and appropriated the benefit of the labor and materials supplied by the contractor , is estopped from maintaining a defense based upon the irregularities noted . We think , under the circumstances of the case , the contractor , or his assignee , was entitled to recover . Substantially , the authorities indicate no different rule in applying the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations than is proper to be applied to the acts of municipal corporations . There is , however , a distinction suggested , and it is this : That where the contract or agreement upon which recovery is sought is one wholly without the scope of the power of the municipality to make ? in other words , is ultra vires ? then there can be no estoppel ; but , where the authority exists to make the contract , but the proceedings precedent thereto have been informally taken only , then the rule of estoppel may be made to operate against a municipality as completely as it would against an individual under the same circumstances This rule of estoppel warranted the respondent in insisting upon the recovery of the reasonable value of the material furnished and services rendered by its assignor , not exceeding , we think , however , the total amount agreed upon to be paid . According to the weight of judicial opinion , a school district will not be required to pay for benefits received under an express contract which it had no authority to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay for benefits received under an ultra vires contract ? , The law , it is said , will not imply a contract which could not have been made expressly . The law , it should be noted , is more strict in the case of ultra vires contracts of municipal corporations proper , or quasi-corporations such as school districts , than it is in the case of private corporations.s ? Speaking of the liability of a private corporation to pay for benefits received under an ultra vires contract , the Supreme Court of the United States has said : According to many recent opinions of this court , a contract made by a corporation , which is unlawful and void because beyond the scope of its corporal e powers , does not , by being carried into execution , become lawful and valid , but the proper remedy of the party aggrieved is by disaffirming the contract , and suing to recover , as on a quantum meruit , the value of what the defendant has actually received the benefit of  | This position is taken by many courts . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under ultra vires contracts without imposing any great burden upon the public . School districts , on the other hand , are merely quasi-corporations with very limited powers . They perform purely public or governmental functions , and all their acts affect the public directly . Taxation is very nearly the exclusive source of their funds . Limitations upon their powers and upon the mode of their exercise are designed primarily to protect the public . To permit recovery for benefits received under ultra vires contracts might place the taxpayers of the district at the mercy of its officers . It might , in fact , enable school-district officers to set at naught many of the fundamental educational policies of the state . Nor have those who furnish goods or services under such contracts any right to complain of injustice . The constitution and statutes are the charter of the district 's powers , and all are presumed to know the law . If one misjudges of the power of a school district , he will be held to pay the penalty of his error . And while this rule may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some instances , work great hardship upon individuals , even greater public hardship and confusion would result were the rule otherwise.53 By the great weight of authority a school district is not liable for benefits received under a contract made in violation of statutory restrictions54 By statute the power of the school district to contract may be expressly or impliedly prohibited under certain circumstances , or the mode of making the contract may be so definitely prescribed as to prohibit all other modes . Again , the contractual  | power of a school board may depend upon the taking of prior action by some other board or official . Contracts made in violation of such statutory provisions are unenforceable and , as a rule , recovery can not be had upon quantum meruit . Contracts in excess of a constitutional or statutory debt limit belong to that class of illegal contracts under which school districts will not be held to pay for benefits received . On this point the courts seem to be in entire accord.55 In the case of Superior Manufacturing Company v. School District No. 63,56 action was brought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of property which the district had purchased in excess of the statutory debt limit . At the time action was brought , the district was in possession of and using the property . In denying the judgment the court expressed the law covering such cases in a very forceful opinion , part of which was as follows : In other words , the language of the statute is intended as a limitation absolute and is for the protection of the taxpayers against any liability on contracts or purchases made on behalf of the municipality by its agents or officers , beyond an amount certain . After that point is reached , they are powerless and can not in any manner or for any purpose burden it with any greater . It is manifest at a glance that to yield to the contention of counsel for plaintiff would virtually wipe out the protection intended by this statute , because , if the district could be made liable to any extent in excess of the legal limit for the value of property received , this would be one manner of creating indebtedness , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be made whenever the necessity or desire to evade the law existed . And in such cases the more the actual danger of excessive indebtedness , and the greater the need for the protection afforded by the act , the greater would be the certainty of its being evaded and an enforceable liability incurred .  | An exhaustive examination of the authorities on this subject discloses that , while courts have been astute to require and compel private corporations to pay for property purchased ultra vises by their agents and officers , where it has been of value and retained and used , they have guarded zealously the rights of taxpayers under statutes similar to the one we are now considering , and have with practical unanimity held that persons dealing with public officers of municipalities do so at their peril and are charged with full knowledge of the rights and powers of these agents and officers to make contracts which will bind their principals . The question has arisen in almost every conceivable form ; but the conclusion reached by the courts has been one , and to relieve the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or for the actual value of the property delivered and received . Similarly , in a Wisconsin cases , a contract to furnish " mill-work " for a schoolhouse created an indebtedness beyond the constitutional limit . The court denied recovery on quantum meruit . Appellant , however , contends that , even though the express contract to pay for the " mill-work " furnished and performed by him be void , yet , as he has alleged and proved that the district has had the benefit , it must be held liable as upon an implied contract . Obviously , if that position is to be sustained in all such cases , the constitutional prohibition . . . . is ineffectual to protect the inhabitants and taxpayers against the unlawful acts of their agents , either the electors in school district assembled , or the school board , or even the individual officers . If , whenever those agents are able to cause lumber to be wrought into a school-house , or work to be done thereon , the district must be held to pay therefor , however unlawful or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , for the district becomes indebted . Nevertheless , the doctrine is not without support from remarks made in opinions of courts and from text-writers , though it is believed that all well-considered decisions stop short of holding that a municipal corporation may be held liable on implied contract to pay quantum meruit for property which it had no power or was forbidden to purchase In the instant case we find the direct and positive prohibition against incurring the liability for the property and labor furnished by appellant , and that prohibition can not be evaded by the legerdemain of substituting the fiction of an implied contract on which the prohibited liability may rest instead of the void express contract . Often the statutes confer upon school districts the power to contract with reference to certain subject matter , but prescribe the manner of making the contract . Where the statutes definitely pre- scribe the mode of contracting and any other mode of contracting is expressly or impliedly prohibited , the mode is the measure of power and a school district will not ordinarily be held liable to pay for benefits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that prescribed in the statutes . Thus the statutes may require that certain classes of contracts be let to the lowest responsible bidder after due notice has been given . Such requirements are usually considered mandatory , and one who furnishes labor or materials in disregard of them will not be able to recover on quantum meruit.58 The case of Reams v. Cooley59 illustrates the reasoning of the courts in cases of this kind . A contract for plastering was let without competitive bidding as the law required . Action was brought to recover on quantum meruit . Recovery was denied . Undoubtedly , a school board , like a municipal corporation , may , under some circumstances , be held liable upon an implied contract for benefits received by it , but the rule of implied liability is applied only in those cases where the board or municipality is given the general power to contract with reference to the subject-matter and the express contract which it has assumed to enter into in pursuance of this general power is rendered invalid for some mere irregularity or some invalidity in the execution @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract is not violative of any statutory restriction upon the general power of the governing body to contract nor violative of public policy . In the absence of such restriction on the mode or manner of contracting the same general rule applies to such inferior political bodies as to individuals , and the former will be held responsible on an implied contract for the payment of benefits it receives under an illegal express contract not prohibited by law But while the doctrine of implied liability applies where general power to contract in a subject exists and the form or manner of doing so is not expressly provided by charter or statute , the decided weight of authority is to the effect that , where by statute the power of the board or municipality to make a contract is limited to a certain prescribed method of doing so and any other method of doing it is expressly or impliedly prohibited , no implied liability can arise for benefits received under a contract made in violation of the particularly prescribed statutory mode . Under such circumstances the express contract attempted to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some invalidity in the exercise of a general power to contract , but the contract is void because the  | statute prescribes the only method in which a valid contract can be made , and the adoption of the prescribed mode is a jurisdictional prerequisite to the exercise of the power to contract at all and can be exercised in no other manner so as to incur any liability on the part of the municipality . Where the statute prescribes the only mode by which the power to contract shall be exercised , the mode is the measure of the power . A contract made otherwise than as so prescribed is not binding or obligatory as a contract and the doctrine of implied liability has no application in such cases No contract , either expressly or impliedly , could be entered into by the school board except with the lowest bidder after advertisement , and , of course , no implied liability to pay upon a quantum meruit could exist where the prohibition by the statute against contracting in any other manner than as prescribed is disregarded . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all such cases , that the application of this rule works a great hardship if the school district may retain the benefit of the work by the contractor and be relieved of liability to compensate him therefor . But the provision of the law limiting the power of school boards to validly contract , except in the prescribed mode , proceeds from a consideration of public policy not peculiar to such boards , but adopted as the policy of the state with reference to inferior boards and public bodies , and it would be difficult to perceive what practical public benefit or result could accrue by legislative limitation or prohibition on the power of such bodies to contract if courts were to allow a recovery where the limitation or prohibition is disregarded . In fact , the plea of hardship urged here was answered in the Zottman case Zottman v. San Francisco , 20 Cal . 96 by language as pertinent now as it was then , where the court said : " It may sometimes seem a hardship upon a contractor that all compensation for work done , etc. , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that he , no less than the officers of the corporation , when he deals with a matter expressly provided for in the charter , is bound to see to it that the charter is complied with . If he neglects this , or choose to take the hazard , he is a mere volunteer , and suffers only what he ought to have anticipated . If the statute forbids the contract which he has made , he knows it , or ought to know it , before he places his money or services at hazard . " Again , the statutes may require that certain classes of contracts be made in writing . In most jurisdictions contracts made in disregard of such a requirement are unenforceable and no recovery can be had for benefits received.6o To hold otherwise would defeat the purpose the legislature had in placing safeguards around the contracting  | parties . The reasoning of the courts is illustrated by a Missouri case 6z A teacher requested the president of the board of directors to employ a janitor , but no action was taken by the board . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the end of the school year , sought to recover for his services . He could not recover even on quantum meruit , because the contract had not been reduced to writing as the law required . The exercise of this power is confined to the mode prescribed by the terms of the statute . It is exclusive of every other mode . Such contract is no contract which the board of directors is authorized to make , unless made in the manner and under the conditions required by the terms of the statute The undoubted purpose of these requirements is that the terms of the contract shall in no essential particular be left in doubt or to be determined at some future time but shall be fixed when it is entered into . If a person can without such contract in the first instance go and bind the school district as on an implied contract for the value of his services , it would defeat the purpose the legislature had in enacting the statute The law will not make that valid without writing which the law requires should be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kansas , 84 Mo . 419 , " From a void contract no cause of action can arise whether of quantum meruit or sounding in damages . " Authority of a school board to contract may by statute be made to depend upon prior action by some other board or official , or upon the existence of certain facts . Such statutory provisions are usually mandatory , and when disregarded no recovery can be had upon an implied contract . Where , for example , the statutes made it the duty of the county superintendent of public instruction to examine the plans for all school buildings and to issue a permit if the plans were satisfactory , and prohibited the payment of any funds for the construction of a building where such permit had not been issued , a contractor who constructed a building without the permit could not recover on quantum meruit 62 The rights of the contracting parties are in no degree altered because of the erection of the building and the consequential benefits to the district . The failure of the parties to contract strictly in accordance with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and precludes a recovery upon an implied contract .  | Similarly , in Illinois , a statute provided that school-district authorities might appropriate to the purchase of libraries and apparatus any surplus funds after all necessary school expenses had been paid . Prior to the existence of the condition named in the statute , a library was purchased and used by the district . The contract was later repudiated and the party who had sold the library contended that the district , having appropriated and enjoyed the use of the library , should be held to pay its value . The court denied the relief sought , pointing out that the authority given to purchase libraries after all necessary school expenses had been paid was a limitation upon the contractual power of the district and an implied restriction of power to purchase generally on credit . The law would not , under such circumstances , imply a contract to pay for the articles purchased and used ' , In some jurisdictions , however , it is held that where a school district makes a contract which it is authorized to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prescribed by statute , the district will be required to pay for benefits received on the theory of an implied contract ' , Thus it has been held that recovery may be had upon quantum meruit for benefits received under a contract which was made in disregard of a statutory provision requiring competitive bidding ' , In a Minnesota case , 66 a contract was made without competitive bidding as the law required . The supreme court held the contract void but allowed recovery on quantum valebat for the following reasons : The improvement served a municipal purpose and the contract was one that the city had power to make , and , had the essential requirements of the law been complied with , the contract would have been enforceable . In such a situation the village may be compelled to pay the value of what it has received . The ex-  | press contract disappears from the case . The cause of action arises , not from any contract on the subject , but from the general obligation to do justice which binds all persons , natural and artificial The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ village has received . The courts of Indiana , Minnesota , and Texas go even farther in permitting recovery on quantum meruit . It seems that the courts in Indiana permit recovery on ultra vires contracts , the only restriction being that the subject matter of the contract must not be prohibited by statute or violative of public policy . In the case of White River School Township v. Dorrell , a township trustee borrowed money to complete a school building although he had no authority to borrow the money . The court permitted a recovery of the amount loaned . The findings show that the money received by the trustee was paid out by him for property actually received by the school corporation and retained by it . The contract for building the house was such a contract as the trustee was authorized to make . The money was advanced to the trustee for the purpose of completing a necessary and suitable school house . The trustee had not the means in hand to complete the building , and the money advanced was , in fact , applied to that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is in no way recognizing the general power in the trustee to borrow money . There is no suggestion whatever of any fraud in the building of the house . Appellant has received and retains the benefit of the money so advanced , and the simplest principles of equity and justice require that it should repay it.67 In other cases in this state recovery has been allowed on implied contracts for benefits received from the use of property suitable and necessary for school purposes even though the express contract was made in violation of statutory provisions 68 In Minnesota the court permitted recovery on quantum meruit in a case where the contract was void because statutory requirements had not been met . A contract with an architect was illegal because the improvement to be undertaken had not been previously authorized by the voters as required by statute . The following excerpt is from the opinion of the court .  | The defendant could legally make the contract involved , had it first been authorized by the voters . As made , it was void because the requirements of the law were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a situation is that the district is obliged to pay for the reasonable value of any benefits which it receives 69 The doctrine of quantum meruit is carried to extreme lengths by the Texas courts . Thus , in the case of Sluder v. City of San Antonio , " it was said : Since the decision in the French Case City of San Antonio v. French , 8o Tex . 575 , 16 S.W. 44o our courts have uniformly announced the doctrine that where a county or municipality receives benefits under a contract , illegal because not made in conformity with the Constitution or statute of the state , or charter provision of the city , it will be held liable on an implied contract for the reasonable value of the benefits which it may have received . In other words , while such contracts are void , and no recovery is permitted thereon , our courts hold that common honesty and fair dealing require that a county or municipality should not be permitted to receive the benefit of money , property , or services , without paying just compensation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ contract or even allow recovery upon quantum meruit under certain conditions , equity and justice may demand that one who has performed his part of an invalid contract be allowed to recover possession of that which is justly his . Contracts which are malum in se , which are violative of public morals and public policy , are so utterly void that the law will have nothing to do with them . They can not become the basis of any action whatsoever ; the law leaves the parties where they are found . If one of the parties to the transaction suffers loss and inconvenience as a result of the agreement , he will be required to suffer the consequences of his illegal act . The rule is different , however , in the case of contracts which are not prohibited by law or contrary to public policy . One may recover possession of money or property delivered in the performance of such contracts , provided such money or property can be identified and returned to the original owner without  | material injury to the property of the other party to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Company v. School District No. 63 , the district purchased furniture and supplies in violation of a statutory debt limit . In passing upon the rights of the parties to the contract the court said : While , under the circumstances arising in this class of cases , all the authorities deny the right of recovery either on the contract or quantum meruit , still all agree that the municipality can not keep the property , and that the plaintiff is entitled to retake it . This seems to be the only remedy available . There is , however , no right of recovery in the original owner unless the property can be recovered without working an injury to the property of the school district . A North Dakota case illustrates the rule . A contract to construct a schoolhouse created an indebtedness in excess of the constitutional debt limit . After the building had been completed and was in use by the district , the contractor brought action to have the contract disaffirmed , to have the parties put in statu quo , and to have the property returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accordance with the stipulated facts , it is impossible to restore to the plaintiff the building erected without destroying property of the municipality . It is likewise impractical to segregate or detach that portion of the building which represents the excess moneys therein owing to the plaintiff Although , in equity , recovery may be permitted in such cases , where no additional burden is thereby placed upon the municipality in excess of the constitutional debt limit , or where the property itself can be identified , segregated , and restored to the parties without injuring the municipality or its property by so doing , nevertheless , in upholding the contractual restrictions absolutely imposed , relief upon equitable principles can not be granted where this can not be accomplished .  | In a recent Oklahoma case , however , the plaintiff who had built a schoolhouse at a price exceeding the debt limit was decreed equitable ownership of the building . In determining the right of a contractor to recover property which has been delivered under an invalid contract , the rule governing fixtures , it has been held , does @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no distinction should be made between real and personal property . The fundamental consideration is not whether the property is real or personal ; it is , Can the property be restored to the original owner without doing injury to the property of the other party to the contract ? In the case of Moe v. Millard County School District , 75 a contractor installed a heating plant under a contract void because in excess of the constitutional debt limit . No recovery was allowed on quantum meruit , but the contractor was permitted to recover the property . We can not see how the doctrine of fixtures becomes applicable to this case so as to prevent a recovery of the property here sought . Why should not a school district be required to return real estate as readily as personal property which it has acquired under circumstances such as are shown by the facts in this case ? .... Neither can we see that it makes any difference in this case whether the property has retained its character as personal property , or has , by being affixed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so affixed to the building , as is admitted that some portions of it are , that its removal would cause material injury to the structure of the building itself , then it would seem to us that a recovery could not be had , not for the reason that the property had become a " fixture " in the ordinary meaning of that term , but for the reason that to permit its removal would work injustice upon the owner of the property to which it had been so affixed . However , to deny removal of this property , which is clearly subject to identification , easily removable without material injury to the structure of the building , when it is conceded that the plaintiff has no other remedy , would clearly be a subversion of the purpose for which the constitutional and statutory provisions in question were framed and would permit the taxpayers of the defendant school district improperly , because unnecessarily , to shift the burden of the education of the children of the district to the shoulders of those who in good faith have furnished the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the extent of the value of this property , which we think they would not desire , nor should they be permitted to do .  | In a number of states , the statutes expressly prohibit a school district from entering into contracts in which one or more of its officers have a pecuniary interest . Where this is true , the courts uniformly hold that contracts made in violation of the statutory prohibition are invalid and can not be enforced.76 Nor will the district as a rule be held liable on an implied contract for any benefits received as a result of the performance of the contract by the other party.77 The law , it is said , " never implies an obligation to do that which it forbids the party to do . " 7$ Were the courts to permit recovery on quantum meruit in cases where the express contract is prohibited , they would defeat the very purpose which the legislature had in mind in enacting the legislation and invite abuses of a very grave nature . As an illustration , in an Indiana case79 the statutes made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any contract with his district . The president of a plumbing and heating company was elected trustee , but before he qualified for the office he entered into a contract with the board of trustees to instal a heating plant in a school building . In the contract it was specified that in case the president of the company qualified as a trustee before the work was completed , the company would employ , at its own expense , an expert to be approved by the other members of the board , to act with the disinterested members in determining whether the contract had been fully performed . The  | court held the contract void and denied recovery for benefits received . It is maintained by counsel for appellants that one seeking equity must do equity ; that the school city holds the benefit of the labor and materials furnished by the plumbing company , and it would be inequitable to adjudge an avoidance of the contract without restoration to the plumbing company of the reasonable value of all work done and materials furnished . In answer to this contention , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be founded on a violation of law Equity follows the law , and assists no one in obtaining or holding the fruits of an illegal agreement , but , on the contrary , leaves such person where it finds him This contract reveals a palpable attempt to evade the law . " He that hath committed iniquity shall not have equity . " A more difficult situation arises where contracts between the district and its officers are not prohibited by statute . In such cases , it is commonly held that the contract is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable 8 ? At any time before the performance of the contract it may be repudiated by the district . In some jurisdictions such contracts are held to be void , ' and in all jurisdictions they are held to be at least voidable 82 Even though the statutes may be silent upon the subject , public policy demands that contracts between the district and its officers be held at least voidable , because " the law will not allow an agent or trustee to place himself in such an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as to have his interest conflict with his duty . " 83 As was said in a New York case:84 The illegality of such contracts does not depend upon statutory enactments . They are illegal at common law . It is contrary to good morals and public policy to permit municipal officers of any kind to enter into contractual relations with the municipality of which they are officers . Nor does it matter whether the contract be entered into in good faith , for the courts will not pause to inquire whether the officer has acted fairly or unfairly . It is enough to show that his self-interest conflicts with the performance of his official duty.85 In the case of Smith v. Dandridge86 the Supreme Court of Arkansas expresses forcefully the rule of law governing contracts of this kind . As a general rule , it is unlawful for a director to enter into a contract with the school district in which he has a personal and individual interest . His relation to the school district as a director thereof is of a confidential and fiduciary nature ; he represents the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account he can not place himself in a position where his own personal interests might conflict with those of the school district which he must represent . The law and public policy forbid him from making a contract with the school district in which he has an individual interest ; and a contract so made by a director will not be enforceable . The principle upon which this public policy is founded is that where one is acting in a fiduciary capacity for another he will not be permitted to make a contract with himself in his individual capacity relative to the subject-matter of such employments ' ? There is great difference of opinion , however , as to whether a school district is liable for benefits received under a contract with one of its officers where such contracts are not prohibited by statute . According to one line of decisions , such contracts are void and no recovery can be had for benefits received.88 In the case of Weitz v.  | Independent District of Des Moines , 89 a member of the board , an experienced architect , was employed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ court refused any recovery for his services even though no statute prohibited the district from contracting with its officers . In the opinion of the court : If the way be opened by a decision of this court by which officers of counties , cities , incorporated towns and school districts may let contracts to themselves , and recover thereon by showing that the contract was beneficial to the corporation , it would lead to the grossest abuses . According to the weight of authority , however , contracts between a district and one of its officers , in the absence of statutory restriction , are not void but merely voidable at the option of the district ? ? It follows , therefore , that if the district elects to permit performance , it will be held to pay for benefits received either upon the principle that the voidable contract has been ratified9 ' or upon the principle of an implied contract 92 In the case of Pickett v. School District No. 193 the Supreme Court of Wisconsin has well expressed the position of those courts which hold that contracts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ratified . Still , there seems ground for a distinction between contracts which are held to be against public policy , merely on account of the personal relations of the contractor to the other parties in interest , and those which are void because the thing contracted for is itself against public policy But in the former , the thing contracted for being in itself lawful and beneficial , it would seem unjust  | to allow the party who may be entitled to avoid it , to accept and retain the benefit without any compensation at all . And it is accordingly held , in all those cases where agents or trustees empowered to sell attempt to purchase for their own benefit , not that the sales are absolutely void and pass no title , but that they may be avoided by the principal , who may have them set aside in equity , if , after a knowledge of the facts , he so elect In such cases the trustee or agent , if the sale or contract were avoided , would get his money back . The principal could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And , perhaps , the true theory is , that , in all cases where the principle we have discussed is applicable , the contract is rather voidable in equity at the option of the principal than absolutely void at law . So that , in a case like this , the defense would be , under the present practice , an equitable one . Undoubtedly in such cases the principal , having full knowledge of all the facts , may affirm the contract . And if he should do so , it would become binding . If it had been fully executed by the contracting party , and the principal should , knowing all the facts , elect to accept and retain the benefit of it , he might be held to have thereby ratified it according to all its terms and conditions . And where it had not been so executed , but had been partially fulfilled , and he elected to accept and retain such partial benefit , he might become liable , on a quantum meruit , upon the same principles as in other cases . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received , not upon the theory of ratification , but upon the principle of an implied contract 94 Equity and justice , it is said , will not permit the district to accept the property or services of its officers and then refuse to pay what they are fairly and reasonably worth . Under such circumstances the law implies a contract.95 Thus , in the case of Smith v. Dandridge , 96 a director was employed to supervise the construction of a school building . A warrant was issued in payment of his services , but an injunction was sought to restrain payment of the warrant . The court denied the writ because the district could not ask for relief which would work injustice . In the opinion of the court : A director is disabled from making a binding contract with the school district , not because the thing contracted for is itself illegal or tainted with moral  | turpitude , but because his personal relation to the district as its agent requires that he should have no self-interest antagonistic to that of the district in making a contract for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is not absolutely void , but it is simply not a binding agreement and may be avoided . If under such voidable contract the school district has accepted and retained benefits , it would still be liable to make just compensation therefor , not because of the contract but upon the principle that one ought to pay for valuable benefits received In the case at bar the appellee Dandridge is not endeavoring to recover under a contract made by him with the school district . As a director of the school district , he could not make a binding contract with it in which he was individually interested His right to receive compensation from the school district is not based on the contract , but it is grounded solely on the principle that he has rendered necessary services from which the school district has received real benefits , and therefore should recover what those services are fairly and reasonably worth . In a number of states the statutes prohibit school-district officers from entering into contracts with the district , and , even in the absence of such statutes , public policy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ naturally arises , therefore , as to what constitutes self-interest within the contemplation of the law or public policy . A contract between a school district and one of its officers will not be held invalid either as violative of statutory provisions or of public policy unless it can be shown that the officer has some official duty to perform in connection with the contract . If the contract lies wholly and completely outside the line of his official duties and there is no conflict between his interests in the contract and his official duties , the contract is valid 97 Where , on the other hand , an officer has any official duty to perform in connection with a contract , the courts are quick to declare it invalid if any appreciable self-interest on his part appears . " The courts are astute to impeach and invalidate any transaction where an official has any personal interest whatever in the matter decided by him . The very appearance of evil ' must be avoided . " q8 Thus it has been held that a member of a school board can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be used by a contractor in constructing a schoolhouse for the district . In a recent Wisconsin case , the clerk of a school board was manager of and a stockholder in a lumber company . A contract was let to build a schoolhouse . The lumber company sold a large part of the material used to the contractor . Before the building was finished , the contractor failed and the company sued the contractor 's surety which had given bond guaranteeing payment of materials furnished the contractor . The court held that the contract between the lumber company and the contractor was void and denied recovery against the surety . The contract was void because , as a result of it , the clerk had a pecuniary interest in the contract between the school district and the contractor , an interest which was expressly forbidden by statute 99 To the same effect is the case of Northport v. Northport Townsite Company . ' ? ? In that case a member of a city council was also a stockholder in a lumber company . The company contracted to furnish a certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case he secured the contract to build the sidewalks , the company to be paid for the lumber by warrants issued by the city . The court held that the member of the council was sufficiently interested in the contract with the city to bring him within the operation of a statute which made it unlawful for any municipal officer to be interested directly or indirectly in municipal contracts . The court said : Long experience has taught law makers and courts the innumerable and insidious evasions of this salutary principle that can be made , and therefore the statute denounces such a contract if a city officer shall be interested not only directly , but indirectly . However devious and winding the chain may be which connects the officer with the forbidden contract , if it can be followed and the connection made , the contract is void . It would seem that the interest of a stockholder of a corporation brings such stockholder within the reason of the rule prohibiting an officer from being interested in the city 's business . It has been held , however , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understanding with a contractor at the time his bid is accepted to build a schoolhouse , may lawfully contract there- after to furnish materials to be used in building the house.101 Nor will the courts issue an injunction to restrain a school board from building a house on property donated by one of its members who owns property adjoining the school site . In the case of Territory v. Board of Trustees for High School of Logan County1O2 a school-board member owned a subdivision of land , part of which he donated as a high-school site . An effort was made to enjoin the erection of a high-school building on the site , the allegation being that the donor was interested in the action of the board because of the possible increase in the value of his adjoining property . Said the court : We think this conclusion too far-fetched to justify a court in applying to this transaction the doctrine of fraud , which is the underlying principle upon which is rested all the decisions setting aside the acts of agents or trustees . Public policy undoubtedly forbids that a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with himself as an individual .. : .. But the law does not prohibit him from making a donation to his cestui que trust ; and the mere fact that in this instance he owns adjoining property which may be rendered more or less valuable by reason of the location of the high school building in its near vicinity , can not be received by the courts as a badge of fraud in the transaction , because the results to follow are purely speculative and hypothetical . As a general rule , the mere fact that a school officer is related either by affinity or consanguinity to a person contracting with the district does not render the contract void or voidable as violative of public policy or of statutory provisions which forbid contracts between the district and its officers . Thus it has been held that a school board may legally employ a teacher even though he be a near relative of two of the three members of the board and even though other qualified teachers might have been employed at a much lower salary ! " In Tennessee action was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the charge being that he had employed his minor daughter to teach and that he would be entitled to her earnings . The court refused to remove the director , pointing out  | that there was no express statutory inhibition against his employing his daughter . Moreover , it was said that the father would be estopped to claim the wages he had contracted to pay . In the case of Lewick v. Glazier , it was held that the fact that a trustee of the village was the father of one who contracted to render service to the village did not render the contract invalid . But where the statutes prohibited a school trustee from having any pecuniary interest in any contract made by the board of which he was a member , the board could not legally employ the wife of one of its members to teach in the school of the district . The husband , it was said , had a pecuniary interest in the contract because under the laws of the state the earnings of the wife constituted a part of their common property . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community property , and he may use it and is part owner in it , and hence is pecuniarily interested in it . " Where , however , under the laws of the state , the husband has no financial interest in the earnings of his wife , it is permissible to employ as a teacher the wife of one of the officers of the district . Nor will the courts enforce a contract between the son of a school-board member and the board where the father is in fact interested in the contract . In a New Jersey case , controversy arose among the patrons of the school and among the members of the board as to whether the school property should be sold and a new site selected . The board voted to sell the property , whereupon one of the board members had his son purchase it under an agreement with the father whereby the son was to hold it for two years , subject to condemnation by the school board at a price named in the agreement . The father belonged to the faction that opposed the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purchase of the property by others , hoping that within two years the board would be willing to repurchase the old site if it could do so at a reasonable price . The son was a young man twenty-two years old with no means of his own . The father supplied the funds necessary for the  | purchase . When the majority faction of the board discovered that it was about to be outwitted , it refused to execute the contract . The court sustained their action on the ground that a school-board member was sufficiently interested in the contract to render it invalid and unenforceable . Frequently contracts which are neither ultra vires the powers of the corporation nor prohibited by statute are , nevertheless , invalid because made in an irregular manner , or by parties who acted without authority . That is , some agent of a school district or board of education may undertake to bind the district in excess of the authority granted . A superintendent of schools , for example , may attempt to employ a teacher , or a majority of a board of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meeting of the board . Or it may be that a board of trustees undertakes to purchase supplies or build a schoolhouse without first having been authorized to do so by the district meeting as required by statute . After such contracts have been partially or fully performed by the other party acting in good faith , the question naturally arises as to whether the district or the board of education may be regarded as having ratified the invalid contract . " Ratification , as it relates to the law of agency , is the express or implied adoption of the acts of another by one for whom the other assumes to be acting , but without authority . " The rule governing ratification is that a principal may ratify any unauthorized act of an agent which might have been authorized in the first instance . " It is a rule , " says the Supreme Court of Nebraska , " subject to few , if any , exceptions , that a corporate authority may ratify and confirm any act or contract in its behalf or for its benefit which it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , a school  | district , or board of education , enters into a contract invalid because of some irregularity in its execution , the contract may be later ratified , provided it be one which the district or board might have lawfully made in the first instance . Of course , a contract which is ultra vires or prohibited by statute is not susceptible of ratification . The principle governing ratification has been well expressed by the Supreme Court of Wisconsin . A municipal corporation may undoubtedly ratify an unauthorized contract made by its agents , which is within the general scope of its corporate powers ; but it is equally certain that it can not ratify such unauthorized acts of its agents as are beyond its scope , or such contracts as it had no power to make originally . .... Ratification and estoppel are of very much the same nature , and the principles which apply to ratification substantially apply also to estoppel . As said by Mr. Dillon in the passage quoted by the chief justice : " The general doctrine is undoubted that there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in violation of the constitution or of an act of the legislature , or which are obviously , and in the strict and proper sense of the term , ultra vires We mean by it , as here used , the want of legislative power , under any circumstances or conditions , to do the particular act in question . " This passage , we believe , expresses the law with clearness . Applying the rule as stated in the foregoing case , it has been held that a board of education may ratify a contract entered into by members of the board acting individually , or at a meeting of which one or more of the members had no legal notice a contract with a  | teacher made by the superintendent or president of the board ; or a contract made by an unauthorized agent , such as a school principal or superintendent of buildings . Similarly , a school district may ratify the unauthorized acts of its trustees , such as the purchase of furniture or the construction of a school building ! 19 On the other hand , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a contract in excess of a constitutional or statutory debt limit ; a contract to purchase school furniture which has not been approved as to price and quality by the state superintendent as required by statute ; a contract to employ a teacher who has not been recommended by the county superintendent where the law makes employment conditional upon such recommendation ; the personal contract of individual board members ; or a contract made outside the scope of corporate powers . While a school board or district may have power to ratify a contract , it is often very difficult to determine whether ratification has in fact taken place . Granted the power to ratify exists , ratification may be said to take place when the acts of the principal , after a knowledge of all material facts , are such as to be inconsistent with any other supposition .  | Performance of a contract , permission to the party with whom the corporation contracts to perform , the acceptance of the performance or the fruits of the performance by the corporation , acquiescence in the contract , payment to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of ratification . The two most common forms of ratification are : ( I ) payment for services rendered , and ( 2 ) acceptance and use of services and goods furnished under the contract . Where officers of a school district , acting at a regular meeting with knowledge of all the material facts , vote to pay for services received or property delivered , their act will ordinarily be construed as a ratification . Where , for example , a teacher is permitted to teach and is paid at least her first month 's salary , the courts almost invariably hold that the contract has been ratified , provided , of course , it be susceptible of ratification . As a general rule , acceptance of services or use of property constitutes ratification without any formal act of ratification on the part of the school authorities . Acceptance of services or use of property by a school board with a knowledge of all material facts is sufficient within itself to constitute ratification and no formal act on the part of the board is required ! ' In some cases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a formal corporate act ! " Speaking of the ratification of a contract entered into by school- district officers acting individually , the Supreme Court of Michigan has said : " It was not necessary that there should be a direct proceeding with an express intent to ratify . It may be done indirectly , and by acts of recognition or acquiescence , or acts inconsistent with repudiation or disapproval . ' In the case of Board of Education v. News Dispatch Printing &; Audit Company , two of the three members of a board acting informally employed the plaintiff to audit the books and records of the district . The court held that acceptance of the services constituted a ratification of the contract . The fact that the members of the board permitted the plaintiff to perform services under a contract which they knew had been executed and was in existence , and receiving and enjoying the benefits of the services rendered by the plaintiff , under the contract , completely ratified said contract . The following rule , announced by the court in the case of Doyle , et @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pac . 386 , 30 Oki. 81 , is applicable here : " The act of the two members of the school district board in employing plaintiffs in error has been fully and completely ratified by the school district by the acceptance of their services , and the enjoyment of the benefits secured to the district by their efforts . When a quasi public corporation receives and retains the benefits of an irregular contract , made by the members of the school district board , acting separately , without any board meeting , it shall be deemed to have ratified the same , and must pay for the services , or other property , so obtained for its use . " Again , in the case of Union School Furniture Company v. School District No. 60 , furniture was purchased by the district officers without any formal meeting and without having been authorized to make the purchase at a school-district meeting as required by statute . The furniture was delivered and used . In holding that the contract had been ratified , the court said : We are utterly at a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ used this furniture during all the time from that date to the trial of this action , .... a period of nearly 51 years ? can claim to be excused from making any payment therefor . It would seem from the pleadings and the record in the case  | that the court took the view that the written order set up in the petition , and also the written contract made by the board of directors with the agent of the plaintiff for the furniture , were void because unauthorized . It may be conceded for the purposes of this case that both these written instruments were void , and that no action could be maintained on either or both of them ; yet the defendant district , having received and retained the property , which the court finds to have been fairly worth the price stated in the written contract , is bound in common honesty to pay for it . During all the time this furniture has been in the possession of the defendant district it is fair to presume that the schoolhouse which was furnished with the seats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same manner as schoolhouses are ordinarily used . It is fair to presume that school-district meetings were therein held annually at the time appointed by law . It is fair to presume that the school district board met there , and caused the seats to be placed in the building and to be used by the district . The board and the residents of the school district must all have known of the use of this property , and their continued retention and use of it shows a perfect and complete ratification of the purchase made by the district officers . In the case of Sullivan v. School District , 39 Kan. 347 , it was held that a contract for the construction of a schoolhouse made by one member of the school-district board alone , on behalf of the district , might be ratified and made binding on the whole school district . This case came again before this court , and is reported in 48 Kan. 624 , and the court then held that " A contract for building a schoolhouse , void because made only by one member @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ binding by the action of the school district in completing the building left unfinished by an absconding contractor ; by furnishing the same with seats , desks , and other necessary schoolhouse furniture ; by occupying the same for school purposes , and by insuring the same . " This case but enunciates the broad doctrine , supported by very numerous authorities , which we do not deem it necessary to cite , and is founded in reason and justice . The principle that acceptance of services or use of property in and of itself constitutes ratification is subject to an important limitation . Ratification will not be inferred from the retention of benefits which the district had no option to reject . Where , for example , a school district uses a schoolhouse built on land owned by the district , such use will not , as a rule , constitute ratification of the invalid contract  | under which the building was constructed . In a Connecticut case , the town of Bridgeport voted in town meeting to build a schoolhouse at a cost not to exceed $55,000 . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ erection of the house . Contracts were entered into for the construction of a house in excess of the amount authorized , and it was claimed that the town by taking possession of and using the house had thereby ratified the acts of its committee . The court denied this claim . Again , it is said that the committee on building and the school committee , on behalf of the town , took possession of the building after it was finished , furnished it , and used it for school purposes , and that the town has in this way the benefit of the plaintiff 's labor and materials to the amount claimed in the complaint wholly unpaid for . It is admitted that the building was erected upon a lot owned by the town . The plaintiff knew this fact when he built the structure . The plaintiff made no sort of claim upon the town for any payment beyond the amount appropriated until long after the building was accepted and in use as a school building and the town had paid the plaintiff his contract price and something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee recognized the plaintiff 's right to recover beyond that sum . Even if the town had received notice that the plaintiff claimed beyond the appropriation before the building was used as a school building , we think it plain that the town had a right to take and continue the possession of the building without incurring liability by that act . The town had no election in the premises . The building had been erected upon a lot owned by the town for the specific purpose of a school-house lot and building . The town had instructed its committee to make a contract , with a certain definite limitation as to the amount of the cost of the building , and the plaintiff knew perfectly well that the committee , neither directly nor indirectly , had any power to contract beyond the letter of that vote . ' The town had paid a large sum for the lot and a large sum to the plaintiff . Under the circumstances it is impossible for us to say that this public , political corporation could not use this building for a public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an agreement with the building corn  | mittee in conscious disregard of the restraints and limitations of their power . There is no authority for the plaintiff 's position We have touched only generally upon one controlling feature of this case . The rules of law , declaring that an agent of a town must pursue his authority strictly ; that if he goes beyond his written authority his act is not valid ; that persons dealing with such agents must look to the corporate act of the town as the source and limit of the powers of the agent ; that any claimed ratification of previously unauthorized acts of such agent must be done by the town in a lawful manner , and , as a rule , directly , and not by implication , and must be made with full knowledge of all material facts ; and that no estoppel in pais can be created , except by conduct on the part of the town which the person claiming the estoppel has the right to and does in fact rely on ? these are essential to the due and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be applied in a spirit of fair respect to the rights of the individual tax-payer . In the case of Young v. Board of Education additional funds were needed to complete a school building . The treasurer of the district borrowed the necessary funds from a bank and completed the building under the direction of the board , although the board never authorized the loan . The court held that no ratification could be inferred from the fact that the district retained and enjoyed the benefits of the expenditure . The case was unlike an unauthorized purchase of chattels which could be restored . The district had no option to reject the improvement . " It would be a very unsafe rule to establish to hold that school officers might borrow money at their pleasure , and bind the district because the same is expended by them in improving the property of the district . " The principles of law governing ratification discussed in the preceding paragraphs are subject to one material qualification . Where the statutes prescribe the mode of making a contract with such definiteness as to exclude all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ making the contract in the first instance . Thus it was said in a Texas case : When there is a mode of contracting prescribed which operates as a limitation upon the power to contract , then the mode prescribed becomes the measure of power , and there can be no ratification inferred from acts recognizing the legaiit v of a contract made in violation of the prescribed mode .  | In Wisconsin , as an illustration , a statute provided that " no act authorized to be done by the board shall be valid unless voted at its meeting . " And it was provided further that the purchase of maps and certain other supplies should " be approved at a regular meeting of the board at which all the members are present . " A map was purchased by two of the members of the board without authority from the board and without the knowledge of the third member . Use of the map , the court held , did not constitute ratification . The competency of the school district officers to ratify an absolutely void act , giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against appellant by the elementary principle that under no circumstances can an official act , not performed in the manner required by law , and expressly prohibited unless so done , be ratified by those guilty of nonfeasance or misfeasance in the matter , by any less formal action than should have been originally had . In the case of First National Bank of Waldron v. Whisenhunt , the school directors had no authority to purchase charts unless authorized to do so by the electors of the district at the annual election previous thereto . Nevertheless , the directors purchased charts and used them in the schools of the district . In holding that there had been no ratification , the court said : The statute expressly provides that such contract can only be authorized by the electors at a meeting regularly called and by a vote cast at an election . This was a necessary condition to be observed before there could be any power to make such a contract , and it could not therefore be ratified except by the observance of those conditions that were essential to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it could be ratified in any event . In Arkansas , however , it has been held that even though the statute require a written contract , the contract may be ratified by the acceptance of services , the ratification extending only to the period of performance . Ratification of acts of unauthorized agents. ? Thus far the discussion has had to do with the ratification of unauthorized acts of authorized agents . It may be , however , that an unauthorized agent , such as a  | school superintendent or principal , may undertake to bind the district without any authority whatsoever . Thus the question arises as to whether there may be an implied agency , and , if so , under what circumstances the acts of such an agent may be ratified . It seems that the rule governing implied agency as it affects private corporations or persons is applicable to municipal corporations and school districts . That is , an agency may be implied from prior conduct where the course of action on the part of the alleged principal and agent has been such as to lead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in fact what he represents himself to be . In the case of Frank v. Board of Education , Rowland , the supervising architect , and Wilson , vice-principal of the high school of Jersey City , had for a number of years employed one Frank to perform certain labor and to furnish materials needed in keeping the school buildings in repair . Although Rowland and Wilson were acting without authority , the board regularly paid the bills as presented . To meet an emergency , Frank was employed by Rowland and Wilson to repair damages to the heating plant of the high-school building occasioned by excessively cold weather . The work done and materials furnished by Frank were done and furnished in reliance upon the past practice of the board in paying for such materials and labor . The board of education knew the work had been done about the time it was done , but made no attempt to prevent it . Frank presented a bill for $684 which the board refused to pay . Judge Black spoke for the court as follows : There is but a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered , viz. , whether a municipal corporation is liable to pay for work done and materials furnished it , by an unauthorized agent , when the municipality had the power to make a contract for such purchases . If so , whether an agency to purchase such supplies in fact can be implied , from the acts and conduct of the parties and a ratification of the contract for such supplies be also implied , from like acts and conduct . The application of elemental and well-recognized principles in the law of agency , to the facts , as disclosed by the record in this case , leads us to answer these questions in the affirmative The literature of the law of agency is rich in adjudged cases . The principles pertinent to the subject under discussion are these : An agency , as between in- dividuals or business corporations , may be implied from prior habit , or from a course of dealings of a similar nature between the parties The agency may be implied from the recognition or acquiescence of the alleged principal , as to acts done @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if the agent has repeatedly been permitted to perform acts like the one in question But when it is implied , .... the power of the agent must be determined from no one fact alone , .... but from all the facts and circumstances for which the principal is responsible So ratification may be implied from any acts , words or conduct on the part of the principal , which reasonably tend to show an intention on the part of the principal to ratify the unauthorized acts or transactions of the alleged agent . . . . provided , the principal in doing the acts relied on as a ratification acted with knowledge of the material facts The same rules apply to municipal corporations acting within the limits of the powers conferred upon them by the Legislature as to other corporations or private persons We think , as the board of education had the power , under the statute , to contract for the work done and material supplied in this case , there was created by conduct an implied agency , an agency , in fact , on the part @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that by implication the contracts of these unauthorized agents have been ratified by the acts and conduct of the school board . Effect of ratification. ? A contract once ratified becomes binding ab initio and is as valid as though it had been legally made in the first instance . If the invalid contract was entire when made , it becomes entire when ratified ; one can not ratify in part and reject in part . Thus , where a contract with a teacher is ratified by permitting him to teach and paying him for the time taught , the district becomes liable for the whole amount stipulated in the contract . In the case of Hill v. Indianapolis , the board of public works entered into a contract which it had no authority to make without previous authorization of the city council . The council ,  | however , ratified the contract . Speaking of the effect of the ratification , the court said : By the very nature of the act of ratification , the party ratifying becomes a party to the original contract . Ile that was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper benefits of it . He accepts the consideration of the contract as a sufficient consideration for adopting it , and this is quite enough to support a ratification . It follows that the contract , having been ratified by the common council of the city , becomes binding upon it from the date that it was improvidently entered into by the board of public works , and is just as conclusive and binding upon it as though it had been made by the previous authorization of the board of public works . In the chapter on the liability of school officers , consideration is given to the liability of such officers to reimburse the district for money paid out on illegal or unenforceable contracts . The question here considered is the right of taxpayers in the name of the district to recover from the parties to whom the money has been paid . It is a well-established rule that , where private parties deal with one another , money paid out voluntarily with a knowledge of all the material facts , and in the absence of fraud , can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because of a mistake of law . But where third parties deal with the officers of a school district the situation is different . Such officers are not free to do with the funds of the district what they please ; they are agents of the state possessing very limited powers . Moreover , since their powers are expressly or impliedly granted by statute , all who deal with them are charged with a knowledge of their powers . It is frequently held , therefore , that where money has been paid out in violation of an express constitutional or statutory prohibition , or for a purpose entirely outside the powers of the school district , it may be recovered from the parties to whom it has been paid in an action brought by taxpayers  | on behalf of the district . Speaking for the Supreme Court of Wisconsin , Judge Winslow well expressed the reasons upon which this line of decisions is based : There are many cases which hold that , as between man and man , money paid voluntarily , with knowledge of all the facts , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on account of ignorance or mistake of the law This is simply the doctrine of voluntary payment . It is frequently applied to the payment of illegal taxes . It is founded upon the general principle that a man may do what he will with his own . He may give it away , or buy his peace ; and , if he does so with knowledge of the facts , he is generally remediless . But public officials do not stand upon the same basis . They are not dealing with their own . They are trustees for the taxpayers , and , in dealing with public funds , they are dealing with trust funds . All who deal with them know also that the public officials are acting in this trust capacity . To hold that , when public officers have paid out money in pursuance of an illegal and unwarranted contract , such moneys can not be recovered in a proper action brought upon behalf of the public , merely because the payment has been voluntarily made for services actually rendered , would be to introduce a vicious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessarily sweep away many of the safeguards now surrounding the administration of public affairs . Were this , in fact , the law , it can readily be seen that public officials could at all times , with a little ingenuity , subvert and nullify that wholesome principle of the law which prohibits their spending the public funds for illegal purposes . All that would be necessary to be done would be to make the contract , have the labor performed , pay out the money , and the public would be remediless . We can not approve of such a doctrine . Thus it has been held that where contracts between a school board and one of its members are prohibited by statute , money paid out on such a contract may be recovered . In the case of Independent School District No. v. Collins , ' " the statutes made it unlawful for any school-board member to be financially interested in contracts with the board . While Collins was serving on the board , a company in which he was a large stockholder sold goods to the district . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recovery of the money .
