In Seattle last week , a ruddy , paunchy little man quietly celebrated his Sard birthday . Then he went to Victoria , B. C. to visit for a week his 50-year-old wife , his youngest sons , schoolboys of 12 and 14 . There this week Rt . Rev. Peter Trimble Rowe , oldest active bishop in the Anglican communion and one of the great missionaries of his time , celebrates the 44th anniversary of his consecration as Missionary Bishop of Alaska . <P> When Bishop Rowe went there in 1895 , the Episcopal Church had three missions in its Alaska diocese ( 586,400 square miles ) . To reach them , he had to mush with a dog sled . From Indian and Eskimo companions , the Bishop learned to keep his socks dry at 78 below zero . He learned the knack of building a fire in a howling gale , learned to pick off wolves outside the camp circle with a rifle . Bishop Rowe mushed 2,000 miles each winter-in sum , he said , more than any other man in Alaska . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sourdoughs in Cy Marx 's Fairbanks saloon . Marx , a Jew , started the collection with a $10 bill , raised $1,400 . " Tough and generous " Tex Rickard , who ran a saloon and gambling house , helped raise money for the Episcopal hospital in Circle City , first in the interior of Alaska . In those gold-rush days , Bishop Rowe bunked with Rex Beach and Jack London , taught the latter about Huskies . <P> In 30 years Bishop Rowe visited the U. S. only ten times , to lecture and raise money . Four times he refused bishoprics in the States . Never a great missionary church , the Episcopal Church kept Alaska on meagre rations . The Presbyterians and Roman Catholics kept larger staffs in the territory . But although Alaska 's baptized Episcopalians number only 6,360 , Bishop Rowe could say that his church has " a prestige among the people of Alaska which is not enjoyed by the other communions . " He plans to return to Alaska in January , to be among the Indians whose faith he admires . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ against bitter winds which would blow a man down . " White people , " says Bishop Rowe , " make me a little tired . They are ready to take everything , and give nothing . "
