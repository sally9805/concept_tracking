txt The two leading makers of tin cans . American Can Co. and Continental Can Co. , v.-111 have their 3936 net profits affected by refunds to customers under revisions for 1937 in packers ' can contracts in line with Robinson-Patman Act requirements . The 1936 contracts arc being settled on the new basis , which involves a scaling down of pr ices to small consumers and a slight mark-up to larger producers . The net effect of the change in discounts is difhcult to estimate , depending on the proportion of large to small customers . The maximum discount on the new basis will be at the $7 , - 000.000 level , gradually scaling down to a flat price at the $500,000 level . The net effect on small consumers will be an 8.  - -  r increase in price , the result of the revisions decreasing with the size of orders The refunds to euqtdmers might affect Continental Can 's 1936 profits to the extent of 50 cents or so a share , while American Can 's adJustments might aggregate slightly more per share . The refunds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be made on the basis of the new rates , will go back to last June when the Patman Act went into effect . Continental Can for the 12 months ended September 30 earned 33 76 a share on the 2,842 , - 870 shares of stock after provision for surtax but not including this new factor . Report for the calendar year will probably include the refund due to contract adjustment , but surtax liability has been reduced by the payment of a 25-cents extra dividend Even with a 50 cents write-down because of the refund Continental ought to cover the 33 25 per share dividends paid on the stock this year . Contracts for Long Term As an offset to the lower billing price of packers ' cans it is understood Continental might reduce its advertising appropriation for 1937 , having already done considerable promotion work on the beer can in 1936 . It is also understood that new contracts of Continental and the other makers are for long terms and that in general the price adjustment has been well received by canners . American Can reports only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the refund on earnings is yet possible . However , the company did a record volume of business in 1936 and despite the adjustments it appears earnings should somewhat exceed the 1935 figure of $5. $3 on the common shares , after preferred dividends . Amencan paid out $6 a share this year and likely will cover that amount , though a great deal depends on the extent of year-end adjustments . Continental Can also increased saxes in 1936 over the large 1935 volume despite the effects of the drought , and both companies appear headed for a year of still higher volume in 1937 . Continental , with more than two-thirds of its business in packers ' cans , stands to benefit more strongly , if normal weather brings an increased vegetable pack for 1937 , than American , with only 25 , ; , to 30% in packers ' cans . Conversely , the reduction in price should hit Continental harder than American . The statistical position of the canned goods market is ending the year very strong due to the short packs of 1936 . The Beer Can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , especially in the oil container and beer fields . Amer , can Can seems to be leading in the latter department , with nearly 600,000.000 beer cans sold in 1936 However , recent talk of increased beer prices has raised a problem for the packaged beer market as to next year 's prices . American Can in 1936 also made further gains in its paper packaging department , turning out 1.000 000 fiber milk containers weekly and also producing paper containers for other foods . Continental has not yet entered this field , at least not on a commercial basis . Regarding the threat of increased competition , especially through the entrance of Owens-Illinois Glass and Crown Cork &; Seal into the field , informed opinion does not believe this will become particularly serious for some time . Present contracts involve a considerable amount of research and other services which the large resources of the leading makers have made nva.lable to their customers . It is felt in some quarters that while the new interests may low down expanqion of the leading makers the long-term contracts now in force and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ very soon to really Lorca : , ening proportions .
