Most contributors to Science ( weekly ) are staid men who avail themselves of the magazine 's columns to write polite letters of criticism concerning the ideas in their fellow scientists ' heads . In last week 's issue , however , was printed with editorial hesitancy and apologies a letter from " An ' Umble Scientist " - anonymous because the author implied he was hoping for an appointment to the Federal Power Commission-criticizing Herbert Clark Hoover , President of the U. S. " Most scientific men , " wrote an ' umble scientist , " were delighted when for the first time since George Washington an engineer became President of the United States . It is however said that Mr. Hoover , as a member of the Cabinets of Mr. Harding and Mr. Coolidge , did not support the scientific work under his charge , and there seems to be no evidence since he has climbed to the presidency that he realizes the dependence of our civilization on scientific work and its applications . " Evidence of Engineer Hoover 's neglect of Science as outlined in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on highway safety , paid no further attention to the members , made them pay their own expenses " though he managed to have it called in the extensive newspaper publicity The Hoover Commission . " Though every other recent President has done so , he has not received at the White House the Government 's official scientific adviser , the National Academy of Sciences , " of which President Hoover is the only member elected for reasons other than eminence in scientific research . " * He refused to speak to the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science held last month in Cleveland . <P> President Hoover , however , did consent to encourage Norman Baker , a cancer doctor of Muscatine , Iowa , who has been branded a quack by the American Medical Association . Recently Dr. Baker started a newspaper to air his opinions . Science 's anonymous contributor quoted an editorial printed this month in the A. M. A. Journal : " By some of the strange influences known only to politicians , President Hoover was induced to apply to a pushbutton @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presses in Muscatine the electrical juice necessary to induce motion , whereby inked rollers applied to paper aided still further the dissemination of Baker 's notions and nostrums . . . . Somewhere , somehow , some secretary succeeded in precipitating the President of the United States into a situation that awaits explanations . " Herbert Clark Hoover , engineer , was graduated from Stanford University in 1895 with an A. B. in Engineering . For 18 years he was engaged in applying the latest U. S. engineering methods in mines , railroads , work which carried him into almost a dozen countries . He has written Economics in Mining ( 1906 ) , Principles of Mining ( 1909 ) , used as a textbook in technical schools . He has lectured on engineering at Stanford and Columbia Universities . With his wife , in 1912 he translated from Latin the first book ever written ( published 1556 ) on mining , de Re Metallica , for which he was given a medal by U. S. mining engineers .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
