txt Manhattan need not worry about the way it has been going downhill , dropping 18 per cent in population in ten years , getting all tangled up in traffic , graft-ridden , depressed . It is going to be rescued . It is going to be bigger and better , and ever so much happier . Glorious things are In store for it . A new Borough President is to be elected in November , and every day is Christmas Day till then . Already the two rival Santa Clauses are standing underneath the tree , slitting red tape with shining shears of hope , and opening packages done up in tinsel and containing the loveliest presents a poor orphan ever saw . Santa Claus LEVY says he is going to finish the west side highway in record time , and tear down the dirty old elevated , and let a lot more light into Allen Street , and raze the slums , and sprinkle the east side with playgrounds , and build a nice new drive along the East River all the way to the Bronx @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climax , he reaches down into his bag and pulls out a plan , all sparkling with diamonds , to run the New York Central trains in a tunnel under the Harlem River and deck over Park Avenue north of Ninety-sixth Street . When he sees that , Santa Claus CARRINGTON , who has been ' doing pretty well himself in a small way , handing out presents with seals all over ' em and chucking the children under the chin , and asking them please to tell him why he ever voted for HERBERT . HOOVER for President ? why , when he sees that prize package of LEVY 'S , he goes and gets a searchlight off one of the Hudson River night boats and rigs it up so everybody can see what is coming , and sweeps his arm with the very same gesture he uses in his famous waving - the - bloody - shirt - from - **25;971;TOOLONG speech , and reaches down into him bag and pulls out a $200,000,000 plan for a monster terminal on the west side , with Grand Central shucked , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and automobiles r rolling down to Raskob through the tunnel . It would lie pleasant to preserve for posterity all the tinsel an1/41 joy and happy emulation of such a friendly rivalry . Unfortunately , smiles are already fading under the tree . Perhaps the strain is too much . Anyway , Colonel CARRINGTON was heard to remark the other day , and not in a whisper either , that Santa LEVY 'S West Side Motor Highway between Canal and Twenty-second Streets was an eyesore . He suggested that if Mr. LEVY did n't have an eye for the beautiful himself , he ought to hire some one who does . Now he has followed that up by asking Mr. LEVY why he does n't do something about the Eighth Avenue subway . As the Borough President has nothing whatever to do with rapid transit , a new $600,000,000 subway is a good deal to ask even him to pull out of his bag . It all goes to show that jealousy can touch with green even the ruddy face of a Santa Claus .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
