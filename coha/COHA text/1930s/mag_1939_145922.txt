Polo is an ancient game of India , but indoor polo was born in a Manhattan riding academy in 1910 . Today the Indoor Polo Association boasts 1,200 players good enough to have official handicaps , a national championship that draws galleries as large as any other indoor sport . <P> Played under practically the same rules , indoor polo differs from outdoor polo in five major respects : three players instead of four ; four chukkers instead of eight ; smaller field ; playing surface of clay , sand and shavings ; leather-covered rubber ball instead of a wooden ball . <P> Last week , indoor polo held its national tournament in Manhattan 's Squadron A Armory . Most sensational performance : Clarence ( " Buddy " ) Combs , son of a New Jersey horse trader , scored twelve of his team 's 15 goals in the first game , six of its ten goals in the second , won the junior ( medium-goal ) championship almost singlehanded for New Jersey 's Pegasus Club .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
