txt Full realization that Germany is in grave danger from foreign political isolation is evidenced in the speech of the Vice-Chancellor , Herr Franz von Papen , to the great Steel Helmet gathering over the week-end at Muenster . " Whoever glances at the world press , which is inspired by the liberal ideas of the last , century , or whoever rends foreign parliamentary speeches regarding Germany 's situation , comprehends that today , as in 1914 , not only the military but the moral isolation of Germany is being accomplished , " ho said . After declaring that it Is nafve and undignified not to face such fact , Herr von Papen spoke particularly regarding the reference to sanctions against Germany made by Lord Hailsham , British Minister of War . Commenting on this the Vice-Chancellor said : " It has evidently not dawned upon this war minister that hyprocrisy is involved In demanding application of sanctions by the League of Nations against a power which does nothing more than conduct a moral fight against immoral treaties . " Disarmament Demanded " Against such conditions , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nothing other than demand our right ' to equal security among nations , that is , the disarmament of other nations , according to the Versailles 1Treaty  --  nothing else . And we shall show that our nation from today on will fight with iron disciplined nerve and equal rights for ail . " To his self-imposed question re , garding the action Germany 's for ' eign political situation demands from each German , Herr von Papen de-dared : " First , we should attempt to make clear to the world that the German nation of Jan. 31 , 1933 ( new National Government now ruling Germany ) , blotted out from Its vocabulary the term pacifism . But simultaneously we should show that the fight against pacifism is not identical with desire for war The decisive fact in the wave of pacifism which shattered our nation 's strength in the last decade Is that it desired to make pacifism not the adoption of an attitude concerning war or peace , but a philosophy of life . " Criticism of Pacifism Pacifist literature on war , according to Herr von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old soldier song , " No finer death could the world give than to be slain by the enemy , " and its failure of understanding the old German aversion of a natural death . He continued : " War gives indications of who are born fighters . One could clearly distinguish the real fighting troops from the ballast . Those who were merely ballast took off their uniforms when the war ended . The storm which arose in 1014-1918 sunk into their memory as an unpleasant episode . But there were others to whom , despite all their sacrifices and loss , the war remains as a melting pot of national unity , the heroic epoch of their lives . through ' which they drew Joy for the future and hope of life . " The Vice-Chancellor concluded ' with an appeal for the self-discipline of these tame fighters ( the Steel Helmets who composed his audience consisting mainly of former Germap soldiers ) now when a foreign political thrcht Is hanging over Germany .                @ @ @ @ @
