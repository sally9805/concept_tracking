txt When peace had come after the Revolution , and WASHINGTON had said farewell to his generals , resigned his commission to Congress and gone back to Mount Vernon , he began to think of a journey beyond the Alleghenies into what was then " the West . " Though invited to France , the demands of his private affairs would not permit his absence . Early in 1784 he was making definite plans , and the day after the departure of his guest LAFAYETTE , late in the Summer , he was off on his lone expedition , ostensibly to look after his Western lands , of which he had 40,000. acres . But he was only three days on the way when he wrote in his diary that the one object of his journey was " to obtain information of the nearest " and best communication between the " Eastern and the Western waters , " and to facilitate the inland navigation of the Potomac River  --  that is , to connect it with the Ohio and its branches . In his diary , which , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the vicissitudes of pioneer traveling across the Alleghenies " perhaps un " equaled by any other record of equal " antiquity and reliability and length , " WASHINGTON not only makes observations about the country through which he is passing , but sets down what he learns from the settlers about the lands and waters beyond . He built the first grist mill on the further side of the mountains . He was the first to experiment with Western coal . Professor A. B. HART has called attention to the fact that he was also the first to tell of a " burning spring , " a natural gas well , in that region . In the schedule of his property along the Kanawha River , mention is made of a tract of 125 acres to which the name " Burning Spring " is given  --  the flaming prophecy of the tying together of East and West , for it was both source and symbol of the power that would drive the automobile and airplane and level the mountains . When WASHINGTON Was thanked by the Legislature of Maryland for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ West and was offered 150 shares of stock at a value of $20,000 , he said ; I would wish that every individual who may hear that it was a favorite plan of mine may know also that I had no other motive for promoting it than the advantage of which I conceived it would be productive to the Union and to this State in particular , by cementing the Eastern and Western territory together , at the time that it will give vigor and increase our commerce and be a convenience to our citizens . How would this matter be viewed then by the world and what would be the opinion of it , when it comes to be related that GEORCS WassJimmie had received five thousand pounds sterling of the public money as an interest therein ? Finally , however , he accepted the stock , but " endowed two charity Schools with its dividends . " With clear conscience he could say that he wished sincerely that every door to the westward might " be set wide open " and that the commercial intercourse might be " rendered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the diary of that extraordinary expedition , prompted by a vision of a new America , one is ready to accept the conclusion of the historian ' that WASHINGTON would have been " the greatest man in Amer " ica had there been no Revolutionary " War .
