txt Those fraternal warriors wild have fought side by side these many years in the cause of irreconcilability ? Senator William E. Borah Rad. , Ida. , and Senator Hiram Johnson Rad. , Cal. ? fell out in the senate today on a point at issue in the war debt Question . They berated each other with much heat , they glared at each other over the heads of intervening senators and in thinly veiled terms but without actual use of the short and ugly word they called each other liar . The row started with . the reading in the senate of letters from Secretary of State Henry , StimSon and Secretary of the Treasury Ogden . L. Mills denying that President Hoover had given Premier Laval. of France assurance that the war , debts would be reduced if . German . reparations were scaled down : .. Answer Borali ! s " Ch'args These letters were elicited by remarks In the senate last week by Mr. Borah ' who asserted that President Hoover had given the European debtors reason to believe their obligations to the United @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The letters are reported to have been written at the instance of Mr : Hoover , who runic , that MMr . Borah in the role of congressional secretary of state is giving comfort to the European defaulters . As soon as the letters were read . Senator Borah arose and pronounced the denials inconclusive . " 1 , thinit , " ? said Senator Borah , " it was sufficient reason for the lfreiNh nation to urge that there be some consideration ' of the ' debts . Whethei. ? It ' was justified in fact or not they so understood it . " JohnSfin Leaps- to Fray . ' Senator Johnson leaped to his feet : He. : could not understand how Borah could Iind Prench misunderstanding of the situation justified in view of the fact that congress in response to the President 's request for a re-creation of the debt commission had refused and had declared in accepting the moratorium against any reduction of the debts : Why did not Mr. Borah , the Californian hotly demanded , speak out when ' the ' moratorium was before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assurances to M. Laval ? . The statement which I made on Wednesday ' amid Which I made today was public property , " retorted Borah . " It was krioWn to all men . Everything which 1 have said might have been gleaned from the public record and from the public press . " Johnson Objects to Delay . " Gleaned front the public record and the . public press ? " snapped Johnson . " Not so , sir . How was it a matter of news on Wednesday last ? It was a matter of news throughout the United States of America when the senator from Idaho took his fiery stand and made the . remark that he did . " We were to depend , were we , when : we sat here upon the moratorium , . upon ? this very subject , upon some newspaper report , when the . facts rested in the bosoms of certain mem : bers ' Of ' this body who knew them : and nobody else except themselves knew them ? Why not speak out then ? ' Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the congress of the United States ? " " The senator from California did .. not need to : relY upon the newspapers , " mildly remarked , the Idahoan : " He could have ' read the public documents signed by responsible public officers , and hail all the information . that had been given to the senate by the senator from Idaho . " . . " That may be , but I think the senator from Idaho possesses a wealth of ? information that the rest of us not possess , " Johnson Hung back sar castically . " I am willing to grant it . ' " I am willing to admit it , " smilet Borah , amid laughter . Withheld During Debate . " Of course , he possesses a wealth of information upon this subject that the rest of us do not possess , and he locked it in his own-heart during the debate upon the moratorium , " Johnson went on , glaring at his adversary . " That is absolutely without foundation in fact , " barked Borah . " Did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moratorium ? " Johnson demanded . " I did not say a word about the moratorium , but the facts which I have discussed here . I was in favor of the moratorium . " " And when we were debating what had transpired during Laval 's visit , did the senator utter a word concerning it ? " " I uttered it to the public press , " Borah explained . Johnson sneered . Raps at Publicity Seeking . " I grant the senator that he can utter to the public press far beyond the rest of us , We can dismiss that aspect of it . " " I trust the senator will not permit any feeling of that kind to control his judgment , " Borah interposed . " There is nothing within my knowledge that was not within the knowledge of the senator , if the senator desired to read the public press and desired to read public documents . " Thereupon Johnson boiled over . " That is absolutely inaccurate , " he snorted . " And , to utilize the words of the senator from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not the access to the White House nor to the gatherings at the White House nor the conferences nor the confidences that the senator from Idaho has . " I grant that very readily . I grant his stature . I grant his greatness . I grant him anything he desires in the unlimited wisdom he attributes to himself . I accord that readily and lie has it . Sneak Out Next Time . " But for the love of heaven , if we get another moratorium or another light upon the debts and he knows anything about them , let him tell his colleagues and tell the American people . It Is not in keeping with the senator from Idaho so to sit mute and silent during such a discussion of a question as the moratorium . " " I assume that the able senator from California reads public documents , " retorted Borah . " I assumed that ho kept himself informed . Hereafter I shall start a kindergarten . " Senators snickered at that . " All right , " came hack Johnson . " I trust @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the senator from ralifornia for the first student , " said Borah with elaborate show of good tamer . " He will have a kindergarten which the senator from Idaho has not observed in this discussion , " frowned Johnson . " It will be a kindergarten of disclosure and of good faith . " Secretary Stintson 's Letter . The letters from Mr. Stimson and Mr. Mills were addressed to Senator Herd of Pennsylvania , who had objected to Mr. Borah 's previous statements in the senate on the same subject , " Mr. Stimson said . " I have received your inquiry as to the discussion which took place last Fear between Mr. Hoover and M. Laval . According to my recollection , and that is quite clear , so far as these discussions touched upon the subject of debts and reparations , they were limited entirely to temporary steps which might be taken to offset the effects of the depression . . . . " No cancellations or revision of either debts or reparations was proposed by either side . No assurances or commitments on such subject were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the close of these discussions was an accurate statement of the discussion in all these respects . " Mills ' Letter Similar . Secretary Mills ' letter to Senator Reed read : " I was present at all of the meetings between the President and Premier Laval . I can say without qualification that there is no justification for any assertion or belief that during the course of those conversations any assurance , direct or implied , was given that there would be a revision of French debt obligations to the United States in consideration of a revision of German reparations such as subsequently took place at Lausanne .
