txt Upward revision in the dividend rate on the common stock of Consolidated Edison CO. of New York is likely to be considered by directors the latter part of this month . The question of the usual quarterly payment of 25 cents comes before the board on July 27 and if an increase is to be made this Summer that will be the last date for such action if the company 's normal schedule is followed . Since the beginning of the year , Consolidated has been developing along lines which have been pointing to a more favorable distribution for the holders of the system 's junior equity , it and when directors deem such action advisable . While first quarter net this year was 88 cents a share as contrasted with 97 cents a share in the corresponding period of 1935 , various factors indicate earnings for the year will at least equal last year 's total earnings of $2.10 per share . This was the lowest annual earnings since the stock was split in 1929 to the present number of shares . Expense Reductions Planned The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as have certain aspects of operating revenue . In addition . the system will save a considerable sum in interest charges as a result of its refinancing program , now under way When completed , fixed charges will have been reduced nearly $5.000 , - 000 .

Quarter Report Ready Soon The earnings statement for the second quarter should be ready for issuance the last week of this month . Accountants are now busy ironing out the complexities injected by the new tax bill and the recent refunding operations . Until these matters are definitely settled it will be practically impossible to reach an estimate as to the final per share figure with any degree of accuracy . The best that can be said at the moment probably is that the second period at least will equal the 48 cents a share of the like 1935 quarter and depending upon the decisions made in treating the matters heretofore mentioned might exceed that figure . Unless there is a further extension of the calamities which have beset the utility industry . the 1935 earnings may well have marked the low point in the system 's more recent history and indicate the return to a more normal level .
