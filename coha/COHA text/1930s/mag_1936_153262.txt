In the mid-twenties one of the most popular songs in the land was the lugubrious lament of a dispirited convict who wished he had the wings of an angel . Some 5,000,000 copies and phonograph records of The Prisoner 's Song were sold . According to a myth as hollow as it was widespread , the composer was a condemned man awaiting execution in the death house of the Missouri or Texas or Oklahoma penitentiary . In Manhattan , around the all-night delicatessens where Broadway song pluggers and publishers gather for gossip and fun , it was always assumed that the composer was Vaudevillian Guy Massey , whose name had been attached to the published music since the song 's appearance in 1924 . <P> Another claimant to authorship of The Prisoner 's Song was Conductor Nathaniel ( " Nat " ) Shilkret . Last week this sawed-off little maestro astounded the industry by going after The Prisoner 's Song in dead earnest . He filed a copy of the music at the Copyright Office in Washington , had his lawyer , Maurice Speiser , call on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ accounting of the baleful ballad 's huge sales and earnings . <P> First record of The Prisoner 's Song was made twelve years ago for Victor Talking Machine Co. by nasal-voiced Vernon Daihart , Guy Massey 's cousin . At that time Nat Shilkret was Victor 's musical director . After the recording , Dalhart took the music he had used to the publishers . Last week Shapiro , Bernstein &; Co. , which still has this manuscript , was positive Massey , not Shilkret , was the author . Guy Massey himself can not be called in to settle the dispute . He died stone deaf in San Antonio in 1925 . Meantime , nobody doubts that Shilkret , now musical director for RKO Radio Pictures , is the composer of The Lonesome Road , Down the River of Golden Dreams , Some Sweet Day .
