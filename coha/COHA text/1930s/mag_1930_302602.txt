Sei Tu L'Amore ? ( Italotone ) . Made in Hollywood by an Italian company , with a cast recruited from Italian actors and actresses living there , this picture differs from the ordinary export translations of U. S. films because it presents an original story , designed particularly for Italo-Americans . Technically it is inferior to Hollywood standards ; the dialog in Italian is not well recorded , but it was received with enthusiasm last week by playhouses in the Italian districts of U. S. cities . The comedy is built around a young girl whom three elderly bachelors keep from committing suicide . They buy the dressmaking establishment where she used to work and set her up as boss . In the end she marries a young architect . Best role-Enrico Armetta as one of the three old playboys . The hero is Alberto Rabaghati , the heroine Luisa Caselotti . <P> Pictures for Italians are made in the U. S. because there are no ranking Italian producing companies . Some 70% of the 2,500 cinema theatres in Italy are supplied by U. S. products . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Quo Vadis ? started in 1913 a fashion for historical spectacles . Poet Gabriele D'Annunzio wrote and directed Cabria . But since 1916 native Italian cinemas have deteriorated . Premier Mussolini has his private theatre , equipped for talkies . For a while he banned all cinemas in foreign tongues . Later he changed this edict , permitting foreign talk if the picture was musical comedy or operetta . <P> Cinema audiences in Italy must endure constant playing of Fascist anthems . Few pictures are released without classical titles . One announced in Rome as The Odyssey of Charlie Chaplin turned out to be the original Paramount , Tillie 's Punctured Romance . Though Italians are partial to German imports , an observer for Cinema reports that when Emil Jannings in Othello was shown at the Royal Opera in Florence , at one performance the audience consisted of six people . <P> <P> Tol'able David ( Columbia ) . This was a hard assignment for Director John Blystone in one way and an easy one in another : his product would be judged in comparison with the silent version Richard Barthelmess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the Barthelmess version as a model for the talkie . The new Tol'able David is an effective , bucolic melodrama , not handled well enough to keep the dialog from slowing it up but finely acted by Richard Cromwell . The story is Joseph Hergesheimer 's anecdote of a frustrated young mountaineer 's struggle against the enmity of a group of brutal backwoods halfwits . Most of the esthetic credit , belongs to Cameraman Teddy Tetzlaff for his presentation of hill scenery . <P> <P> The Dancers ( Fox ) . When Phillips Holmes finds his boyhood sweetheart ( Lois Moran ) teaching school in a small French town , she confesses to him that she has not lived up to the inscription she once wrote on her photograph : " I could not love thee , dear , so much , loved I not honour more . " Holmes , however , has been true to her . A fair thematic idea knits up this otherwise silly and incoherent picture . All is based on an old story of Sir Gerald Du Maurier . All is distinctly British in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pictures of Mrs. Patrick Campbell , famed British oldtimer . Now 65 , she takes the part of a stern aunt . Most expected shot : Holmes beating up his rival . <P>
