Next to Salome 's , the most popular of operatic strip teases is that of Massenet 's sin-shunning Thais . Because dramatic sopranos with decently strippable figures are rare , and because Massenet 's music and drama are otherwise soupy and dull , Thais is nowadays seldom performed . Greatest of all Thais strippers was famed Diva Mary Garden , who introduced the part to the U. S. in 1907 ; last at Manhattan 's Metropolitan was tempestuous Maria Jeritza , 13 years ago . Last week the Metropolitan revived Thais , in one of the most lavishly costumed productions of its recent years . This time the stripper was Helen Jepson , streamlined Pennsylvania-born soprano . Critics approved Soprano Jepson 's singing and her French diction but thought she undressed with a Pennsylvania accent . <P> Most famous teacher of composers today is a woman : grey-haired Nadia Boulanger ( TIME , Feb. 28 , 1938 ) . For 30 years in her Paris studio Pedagogue Boulanger has been quietly hatching out one adept music-writer after another . Nearly every younger modernist who has ever been near @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week Teacher Boulanger took her prize pupil to Manhattan , there led the Philharmonic-Symphony in accompaniment while he played his best-known composition . The pupil : a slight , dark-haired , 26-year-old Frenchman named Jean Frangaix . The composition : his tricky , chattering , exuberant Piano Concerto , recorded four months ago by Victor ( TIME , Nov. 7 ) . Manhattanites were not impressed by Pundit Boulanger 's claims that Composer Frangaix was " a genius , " but they found his concerto an agreeable , earsome knickknack . <P> Finest opera to be heard at Manhattan 's Metropolitan Opera House today is Wagner opera . And the most important and painstaking of its Wagnerian productions are those of the two Nibelungen Ring cycles which attract some 8,000 listeners annually . No light-headed cafe socialites are they . Wagner 's Nibelungen epic consists of four ponderous operas ( Rheingold , Walkure , Siegfried , Gotterdammerung ) totaling 14 hours of music &; drama , requires tremendous listening endurance . But for eight years every Metropolitan Ring cycle has been sung to a sold-out house . Last week the first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hours and a quarter ( Rheingold has no intermission ) the intrepid listeners took it and liked it . Only one woman had to be carried out .
