Slowly the giant overhead lights of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden dimmed . Across a bright lattice of wavering spotlights glided a tiny girl in an abbreviated costume of red &; gold , a ribbon fluttering saucily in her hair . In the centre of the ice , her sturdy little legs suddenly twinkled into the first steps of a mazurka . Then she swung into a Lutz jump , a Jackson-Haynes spin , glided backward the length of the rink in a fadeaway stop . To lay observers , this brief turn was not remarkable . For experts it was an exercise in sheer genius , the climax of the evening . Cheering wildly , they demanded two encores . <P> This extravagant reception at the International Skating Carnival last week was nothing new for 23-year-old Sonja Henie , Olympic Figure-skating Champion in 1928-32-36 , World Champion in **31;12143;TOOLONG . What was new was that Norway 's Henie was making her first appearance as a professional .

Last summer at the neat Henie country place just outside Oslo , she discussed with her parents her longtime ambition . They heartily approved the idea . Wary of professional managers , including Sonja 's faithful swain , 40 year-old Promoter Jefferson Davis ( " Tex Rickard of Europe " ) Dickson , they made contact with a longtime friend named Dennis Scanlon . Mr. Scanlon , who runs a surgical-instrument factory in Sweden but lives in Manhattan , promptly set to work to ballyhoo Sonja to Hollywood by way of a U.S. skating tour . <P> Fortnight ago Sonja arrived in Manhattan , squired by her watchful father , whose fur business seldom receives his attention , and her morose , dour-faced mother .

Then her sound business sense got the better of her . She signed for the tour .

Queen Mary gasped when she saw Sonja in 1928 , deplored the fact that she herself could not figure skate . Edward VIII has paid her many a kingly compliment . In 1934 ex-Crown Prince Friedrich Wilhelm of Germany gave her his diamond stickpin crowned with the Hohenzollern crest . Her own sovereign , King Haakon VII of Norway , sends her a telegram or cable before every foreign appearance .
