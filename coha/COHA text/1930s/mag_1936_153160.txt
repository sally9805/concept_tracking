The Poor Little Rich Girl ( Twentieth Century-Fox ) . Shirley Temple pictures , emerging with the regularity of the seasons , have one point in common . All are minutely tailored to suit her requirements . In this procedure , the weak point is that Shirley Temple 's requirements have now outgrown the ingenuity of her purveyors . Her current summer issue , in doing justice to the Temple torch song and tap dance , neglects the Temple talent for emotional acting . <P> A thoroughly modernized version of the Mary Pickford classic of 1916 , The Poor Little Rich Girl depicts its peewee heiress-heroine wandering away from her father 's mansion , following an organ grinder to his basement flat , making friends with the vaudeville actors who live upstairs , joining their act which turns out to be a smash hit on the radio hour of the crotchety soap manufacturer who is her father 's business rival . Shirley is absent from the screen in only six sequences , foots neatly through three dance numbers , sings You 've Got ta Eat Your Spinach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Best shot : the Temple sneeze . <P> Bunker Bean ( RKO ) . Admirers of Harry Leon Wilson 's famed Merton of the Movies will find in Wilson 's Bunker Bean another introvert so thoroughly frustrated that his past neglect by picturemakers seems inexplicable . Bean ( Owen Davis Jr. ) is a male secretary who spends evenings typing , gratis , a fellow-roomer 's treatise on reincarnation . Gathering from this work that a man 's success depends on knowing what he was in past incarnations , Bean consults a seeress who tells him he was Napoleon Bonaparte .

Of the two , the latter is the more appalling . The earthquake , however , has more noteworthy sound effects . In addition to glimpses of tables falling , walls caving , bricks pouring , houses toppling , streets gaping and a city burning , it includes enough squeaking , howling , booming and crashing to shake the rafters of the sturdiest cinemansion . An earthquake in the real Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer manner , it lasts for 20 minutes on the screen and in all respects except casualties no doubt betters its original of 30 years ago .            @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
