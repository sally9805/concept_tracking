The most important chemical equation in the world is the following : carbon dioxide plus water plus energy from sun equals sugar plus oxygen <P> ( 6 CO2 ) + ( 6 H20 ) + ( 674 calories ) = ( C6H1206 ) + ( 6 02 ) . <P> This is photosynthesis , the manner in which green plants create organic food substance from carbon dioxide and water , in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll . Chlorophyll , which does not take part in the transformation , is nevertheless the catalyst or activating force which makes it possible . All animals , including man , get their sustenance directly or indirectly from the energy stored by green plants . Thus if it were not for the chemical reaction summarized in the above equation , no life on earth could exist . <P> When extracted from the plant , chlorophyll as a catalyst is no longer effective . Scores of laboratories working on the problem of imitating natural photosynthesis have tried other catalysts , but none works so efficiently as chlorophyll . Some ten years ago at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtained formaldehyde , sugar and starch from carbon dioxide , water and artificial white light , using nickel oxide as a catalyst , but in tiny quantities and at low efficiencies . <P> At a science congress held last fortnight in Calcutta , Dr. Baly summarized this work , making some new additions to photosynthetic theory . Copyreaders in the U. S. slapped lyrical headlines like NATURE 'S HARNESSING OF SUN IS DUPLICATED BY SCIENTIST on dispatches from Calcutta , but as chemists sifted the reports last week such statements seemed overenthusiastic . Specialists were more impressed by Dr. Baly 's opinion that natural photosynthesis is carried out in two steps-the first in blue light of short wave length , the second in red light of long wave length . <P> There is no practical reason now for harnessing the sun 's energy . But should the problem become urgent , because of depletion of the earth 's supply of coal and oil , it would be possible to use huge shallow tanks of water and carbon dioxide for solar power plants if a catalyst as good as or better than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in many quarters to be the world 's leader in artificial photosynthesis of organic substances.
