The three big U. S. phonograph record manufacturers ( RCA Manufacturing Co. , Decca , American Record Corp. ) have been doing a steadily improving business since the abysmal days of 1933 . Last week three small record companies were making good news for U. S. disc-dilettanti . Founded by earnest amateurs of music , all were operating in Manhattan , all on smallish budgets . For their material , all had gone into the byways of classical music , in some cases with such gratifying results that the big recording companies were following their lead . <P> Musicraft . Last February Musicraft Records , Inc. was the first of the three new little firms on the market with such discs . A youngish Manhattan lawyer named Milton L. Rein and a music teacher named Henry Cohen formed the firm , took in Herman Adler , a musical researcher from Germany , as digger-in-chief for recordable works . <P> Musicraft has its own small studio in Manhattan , like the other small firms farms out the pressing of its discs . Its artists include the Perole Quartet , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for future releases ) Pianist Kathleen Long , able Britisher who is known among disc-collectors for her Mozart , and who made her U. S. concert debut in Manhattan last fortnight . <P> With 60% of its business outside Manhattan , Musicraft sales this month were twice those of July , four times those of February . A rare Bach secular cantata called The Coffee Cantata proved so popular when released last month that Victor soon came out with a secular cantata of its own , Peasant Cantata . Last week 's chief Musicraft offering was two of Bach 's Trio Sonatas for Organ , played by Organist Carl Weinrich on the Westminster Choir School organ in Princeton . <P> Most organ records are bad , and to purists Bach sounds too thick , too soft , when played on an organ built , as most modern organs are , on 19th Century lines . According to Musicraftsman Adler , the clean , transparent tone of the Trio Sonatas derives from the 17th Century-style engineering of the Westminster organ ( built by Aeolian-Skinner and equaled in " baroque " tone only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Harvard ) . <P> Timely . Simply because he and his friends liked rare music , a Manhattan casualty insurance man named Leo Waldman acquired , last May , Timely Recording Co. , which had made and sold some left-wing " workers ' songs . " For his musical adviser and program annotator . Insurance Man Waldman signed up William Kozlenko , music critic and editor of One-Act Play Magazine . Timely 's first offering , out last week , proved a notable find-eight brief symphonies by an almost-forgotten British composer named William Boyce ( 1710-79 ) . <P> So short that sometimes two movements are played on one ten-inch side , the Boyce works are melodious , inventive , contrapuntally ingenious . They were conducted by Mr. Waldman 's part-time associate , Max Goberman , onetime pupil of Leopold Auer , onetime violinist in the Philadelphia Orchestra , at present assistant concertmaster in Andre Kostelanetz ' radio orchestra . Messrs . Waldman and Goberman declare that their firm , which will issue an old and a new work every month ( first new one : two octets by Dmitri @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into the making of more &; better discs .
