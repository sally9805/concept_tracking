To London last week for a " private visit " went Adolf Hitler 's financial magician , clammy-handed , high-colored Dr. Hjalmar Schacht . President of the Reichsbank . Dr. Schacht is the only German bigwig who is persona grata in British financial circles for , despite the way he has kicked around the laws of economics , British bankers like to think that he has done so under political compulsion , that fundamentally he is a sound financier who may eventually lead Germany back to respectable financial methods : His host last week was his old friend , hoary-bearded Montagu Norman , Governor of the Bank of England . <P> Dr. Schacht had been dispatched to England : 1 ) to persuade those interested in getting the Jews out of Germany to pay a " ransom " in the form of increased purchases of German goods ; 2 ) to stave off Britain 's threat to " fight Germany at her own game " for the trade in Central Europe and South America ; 3 ) to get Britain to buy more from Germany than she has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need to sell more goods abroad was clear last week when Germany 's foreign trade figures for the first nine months of 1938 were published in Berlin . In 1937 , largely due to Reichsbanker Schacht 's barter trade methods and subsidies to export industries , Germany was able to build up a favorable balance of 422,000,000 marks ( $168,000,000 ) . In 1938 this favorable balance has been wiped out and Germany 's imports have grown to 398,000,000 marks ( $159,200,000 ) more than her exports . Over half of this deficit was due to Austria 's annexation , the remainder partly to the world-wide anti-German boycotts , partly to the huge imports of war materials . <P> Desperate for ready cash* in the till-without which she can not continue to import the raw materials necessary for her military machine-Germany month ago turned to systematic spoliation of her Jews . Unless her foreign trade position improves , she may next squeeze the vast holdings of the Catholic Church and perhaps the wealth of the upper middleclass . <P> The general impression in London was that Dr. Schacht returned to Berlin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visit " had included a secret conference with U. S. Lawyer George Rublee , director of the Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees . ) If Dr. Schacht had any hopes that Britain would call off her trade war with Germany , he must have been disap pointed when the House of Commons unanimously advanced through its second reading a new Export Credits Bill , which raises from $250,000,000 to $375,000,000 the amount of obligations the Government can incur in " insuring foreign trade " and provides a special $50,000,000 " fighting fund " for subsidizing trade " valuable to Britain but not justifiable as sound commercial risks . " <P> *Also short on cash are : 1 ) Italy , where the 1939-40 budget last week revealed that during the next fiscal year Italy will suffer an unexpected 4,755,000,000 lire ( $237,750,000 ) deficit , largely due to arms expansion ; 2 ) France , where the Chamber of Deputies last week worked on the greatest arms budget since the World War which , in its ordinary and extraordinary appropriations , upped last year 's budget 36%.      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
