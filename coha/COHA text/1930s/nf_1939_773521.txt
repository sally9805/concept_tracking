txt // young man can not raise the bride price , he may be compelled to remain with his father-in-law and mother-in-law as their servant , and his children will belong to them . Also , permanent matrilocal residence , such as the Pueblo Indians have , is the exception rather than the rule , the usual type requiring the bridegroom to remain with his wife 's people for a season only ? perhaps until after the birth of children ? when he can set up an independent household . This is the case with the Hidatsa Indians . But whatever the mode of residence , it has a profound influence on the total family life , for it affects the alignment of kin and hence the status of both parents and children . Matriarchate vs . Patriarchate. ? Bachofen 's early work , " Das Mutterrecbt " and Briffault 's recent work , " The Mothers " both assert the superior role of woman in primitive society , though Briffault arrives at his conclusions by a different route from the earlier writer and scoffs at Bachofen 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Henry Maine , in his " Ancient Law , " sought to prove that there never was a matriarchal stage but that man had always been dominant . Although this school of thought has probably always been in the majority , the other school has a considerable following . To Briffault the whole process is so clear that he wonders how others can fail to " see the light . " He finds no trace of patriarchal organization in the animal world ; it is entirely matriarchal . Because such is the family organization out of which the human social group is supposed to have arisen and because of certain archaic customs that can not otherwise be explained , he thinks matriarchal organization must be assumed . He asserts that maternal love in primitive woman , growing out of the maternal instinct in the higher mammals , became a constant , permanent factor long before the more or less periodic sexual impulse had evolved into love between the sexes . Coupled with this maternal love and making the union of mother and young almost inseparable is the attachment of the young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , not to any sentiment of tenderness , but to a sense of dependence on the mother and a fearful panic in her absence . Among human beings this period of dependence of the young is so long that the mother and her offspring form a relatively permanent social unit , strongly resisting disintegrating forces . When the children approach puberty and the mating impulse begins to show , the test of the cohesive force comes . As we have seen in the discussion of exogamy , Briffault believes that the mother was too jealous of the allegiance of her sons to permit its transfer to her daughters when she saw her sons making sexual approaches to t heir sisters . This channel of intercourse being forbidden by the mother , there was no of her way than for the sons to seek mates elsewhere , which they did . Hut the mother could retain control over her daughters by insisting That whoever Milted With them should come into her group and // remain under her control . Such authority made the mother group a permanent cohesive unit , with no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gradually extended to property and political rights , when such arose , but this was not the rule . For matriarchy existed from the very first , becoming a complete and well-defined social grouping before private property ever came into being ; in fact it was perhaps private property that more than any other factor caused its downfall . Wherever private ownership and transmission of property began to assume importance the matriarchal order rapidly gave way to the patriarchal . For " the primitive ascendancy of women is not founded on artificial economic control arising from proprietary rights , but on the functional constitution of the social group . " ' Such , in bare outline , is the basis of Briffault ' s theory of the original universal type of social organization . It appears , then , that when Lowie declares vehemently that modern anthropologists are almost unanimously agreed on the inadequacy of the matriarchal theory , the two are not talking about exactly the same thing . Briffault says we should not think of the matriarchate as the reverse of the patriarchate , with men in as helpless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But Lowie contends that the true matriarchy involves the complete control of family , property , and state by the women and as such is nowhere to be found . It is not even approached by more than four or five tribes out of all those who have matrilocal residence , matrilineal descent , or both . The cases best known are the Khasi of Assam , the Pueblo Indians , and the Iroquois , the latter approaching most nearly to complete matriarchy . Among the Khasi the houses , real estate , and jewels are not only transmitted through the mother , but from mother to daughter . But in reality man plays the dominant role ; even though the woman owns the house , her elder brother ranks as its head . Also , the matrilocal residence of the husband is only temporary , and after he establishes his own household his authority is undisputed ; he even has the right to kill his wife if taken in adultery . As to political power , sovereignty is transmitted through the mother 's line , but from male to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she have the chance of succession , but at her death the authority passes to a son , not a daughter . Thus the property rights of women among the Khasi give the appearance of a true matriarchy without its substance . Among the Pueblos the wife owns the home and can banish her husband from it if she so wishes , in which case he goes back to his mother 's home . But among the Iroquois the women not only own the houses and land but also have considerable political power . They manage some of t he most important ceremonial organizations , they nominate a candidate // for a vacancy in the council of chiefs , and they can even impeach an unworthy chief-elect . Yet no woman belongs to the supreme council of the league . ' Thus , to one school , the matriarchate was first , and from it came naturally the tracing of descent through the mother and matrilocal residence by the male . To the other school , matrilocal residence came first , followed by an improved status of women and here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matrilocal residence results not so much in the superiority of the wife herself ( though it may do that too ) as in that of the wife 's kin . Yet personally the wife frequently gains from the system , for it sometimes raises her status and often adds to her security . When the husband is forced to live with his wife surrounded by her own relatives , it would require either great courage or unusual stupidity to refuse the wife a new leopard skin if her heart were set on one . THE THEORY OF ORIGINAL PROMISCUITY The theory that man was at first entirely promiscuous in his sex relations has long been held in some quarters . The discussion of this theory is helpful not only because the question is an important one but also because it discloses a wide variety of sex practices among primitives , the knowledge of which is essential to an understanding of the natural history of the family . The following exposition of the theory is necessarily highly argumentative in form . When Morgan first set forth his theory of the evolution of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Those who could never stomach the idea of our animal origin were shocked to think that man had ever been promiscuous but were somewhat relieved when told that man had not remained in such a state but had advanced to higher stages , finally reaching the ultimate and most ethical form ? monogamy . Morgan did not definitely state that the first stage was promiscuity but claimed that such an assumption was logical in the light of the following stages . The second stage was the consanguine family , founded upon the intermarriage of brothers and sisters , and the third stage the punaluan , in which groups of brothers shared their wives in common and groups of sisters shared their husbands in common . Later followed the better known forms , polygamy and monogamy . His thought is clearly summed up in these words:2 Wherever the middle or lower stratum of savagery is uncovered , marriages of entire groups under usages defining the groups have been discovered either in absolute form or such traces as to leave little doubt that such marriages were // normal throughout this period of man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ husbands and wives is found to have been a law of the savage state , and , therefore , the essential condition of society in savagery , the inference would be conclusive that our own savage ancestors shared in this common experience of the human race . No one today holds to Morgan 's system of cultural stages , not because we any longer shudder at the " depravity " of primitive man but simply because we have learned so much more about primitive customs than was known when he wrote . We are now convinced that , whether in the field of family relationships , government , or other phases of culture , man ( lid not everywhere go through the same steps . But though many of Morgan 's theories have been outmoded , his idea of man 's early promiscuity has never lacked support , such names as Bachofen , McLennan , Lord Avebury , Giraud-Teulon , Kropotkin , and Bloch being arrayed with his , to say nothing of Briffault and the newer school . Gerrit S. Miller , a mammalogist , brings testimony from his field @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exists among primates but that as a rule monkeys and apes roam about in promiscuous bands . He asserts : ' ... the common possession by men and monkeys of a type of sexual behavior which perfectly harmonizes with the need of promiscuous life throws a heavy burden of proof on those who insist that the forerunners of existing men lived under a group formation totally different from that which appears to be the prevalent one among nonhuman primates . Furthermore , when human sexual behavior is looked at as it is and not as it is conventionally supposed to be , we have little difficulty in detecting beneath the surface of the cultural structure unmistakable traces of the framework of the promiscuous horde . Perhaps the most uncompromising opponent of the theory of promiscuity is Westermarck , who devotes more than 200 pages of his first volume to its refutation . He points out that the evidence used in support of the theory comes from two sources : ( 1 ) the accounts of both ancient and modern writers regarding peoples said to be living or to have lived in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ surviving customs which are supposed to point to an earlier stage of culture when marriage did not , exist . Concerning the general credibility of the ancient writers he shows that in the same chapter in which Pliny describes the Garamantians as being promiscuous , he tells of another African tribe , the Blenmyans ! , who have no head but have mouth and eyes in the breast ! To modern writers he gives careful attention but can find no case of In ? Owc ( l promiscuity. // Westermarck'sl main arguments come in his discussion of seven customs which have been set forth by various writers as survivals from an earlier stage of promiscuity and which he seeks to show are due to other causes . 1 . Prenuptial Unchastity. ? The fact that among many uncivilized peoples both sexes enjoy complete freedom of intercourse before marriage has frequently been offered as proof of previous promiscuity . But , says Westermarck , other causes may explain this . ( a ) Laxness in sex conduct is frequently due to contact with foreigners , the first visitors to a tribe often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are found to be saturated with the white man 's vices. ( b ) Sexual relations between a boy and girl are often a preliminary to marriage , a part of the courtship . Among some it is a sort of trial marriage which can be terminated if there is dissatisfaction . ( c ) Ability to bear children is considered so essential among primitives that frequently a man will not marry a girl until she either is pregnant or has borne a child ; the premarital relationship is a test of fertility . ( d ) Among other tribes , where such relations do not necessarily denote intention of marriage , pregnancy is promptly followed by marriage . The very fact that the father of the expected child is known shows something very different from promiscuity. ( e ) Even among tribes where sex play between boys and girls is considered by their elders as merely amusing , such freedom usually comes to an end at marriage ; but even if considerable laxness is winked at after marriage , it does not prove that once there was a stage without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through such a stage . ( f ) Prenuptial unchastity is nothing like a universal characteristic of the lower peoples . Among many tribes such conduct is punished severely , sometimes by death . ( g ) If premarital freedom were a survival from an earlier state of promis- // cuity , we should expect to find it most prevalent among the lowest types of savages ; on the contrary , chastity is more common among the lower tribes than among the higher . 2 . Jus Primae Noctis. ? It has been claimed that , since individual marriage resulted in exclusive possession where previously all had enjoyed communal rights , a temporary recognition of these preexisting common rights was acknowledged by according the jus primae noctis to a priest , king , chief , or nobleman who was looked upon as representing the community . In other words the giving of this right was a sort of expiation for the antisocial breaking ( by marriage ) of the natural system of communal relationships . The opponents of this theory admit that the custom is fairly widespread but deny that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the priest or other person chosen for the purpose is paid for , though not always . Among some tribes the groom is willing to pay handsomely for this service , for he fears the first intercourse with the bride . The superstitious dread of pollution by hymenal blood prompts him to seek a substitute who is not susceptible to the danger as is the bridegroom . In fact if the priest performs the rite , this has the force of sanctifying the marriage and perhaps ensuring fertility . If the service is rendered by the king , it is considered a great honor by the groom . On the other hand there may be present in the custom the right of might , the king demanding the jus primae noctis even as he demands the first fruits in all else . There are plenty of peoples among whom every girl , before marriage , must be given to the king if he so wishes . A variation of the custom , in some tribes , permits the male guests at the wedding to have access to the bride before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men usually present gifts to he bride . This latter custom complicates the argument , whether of Westermarck or his opponents , for how can an act that is feared and *voided by the principal , and for which he is willing to pay a substitute , be one and the same in origin with an act so pleasurable and sought after that it requires gifts in return ? 3 . Religious Prostitution. ? The temporary prostitution of a girl before marriage , or of a matron in the service of religion , is a very cornMon custom . Various explanations for it have been advanced , one of the commonest being that it is a development of vegetation ritual , a Pi titillation of all the reproductive forces of the earth , ensuring fruitfulness of earth , beast , and man . Frazer accepts this theory , but insists with Avebury and others that the taproot of the whole explanation is promiscuit . Says Bachofen : // Marriage itself seems as the violation of a religious commandment . . . . Such a theory alone can account for the belief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it violates by its exclusive character . . . . The deviation from natural law which is implied in marriage must be expiated by temporary prostitution , thus winning anew the favor of the god . This theory Westermarck rejects , accounting for religious prostitution on the ground that intercourse with a holy man is considered beneficial ; it is not only a safeguard in the case of brides but may be a positive cure for sterility in the case of matrons . 4 . The Lending and Exchange of Wives. ? The custom of the host lending his wife to his guest seems to Avebury and others a recognition of the inherent right of every man in the community and of male visitors as temporary members . Briffault considers wife lending an act of clan ( or tribe ) brotherhood . Since one is either a tribal brother or an enemy , acceptance of a stranger means granting him the same rights ? sexual as well as other ? that a brother has , and refusal of sexual hospitality is resented as an insult . But would not such explanations @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meal or bed to a guest to be interpreted as a relic of communism in food and shelter ? To Westermarck the lending of wives to guests is merely an incident of the general rule of hospitality . Indeed , it was not always the wife who was offered , but perhaps a daughter , a sister , or a servant . Such an offer in many places is considered an act of extreme courtesy and generous hospitality . The temporary exchange of wives with friends , likewise accounted by some a relic of past promiscuity , is often in reality merely a matter of good will and friendship . Sometimes it is frankly a matter of temporary enjoyment as in the case of the Negroes of Angola who excuse themselves on the ground that they were " not able to eat always of the same dish . " Among the Eskimos such exchanges are often for practical purposes . If a man can not easily take his wife on a journey because she is encumbered with a small child , he may exchange wives , as a matter of convenience @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Again , the exchange may be made when the men are angry or displeased with their wives , or in case of adultery when an exchange is sometimes made with the guilty marl . In some cases , exchange is connected with superstition and takes place only after certain solemn ceremonies . Thus the practice can be traced to several causes ; and since it seems to be a voluntary agreement , and not due to the claim that one man has on another 's wife , there is no reason to regard it as a survival of promiscuity. 6 . Sexual License at Certain Festivals. ? Phis is a common prat t often being a feature of religious festivals connected with the idea of the fertility of the earth and all things thereon . Among some , these occasions // are in the spring , at planting time , and among others in the fall , at the harvest . In Madagascar licentious orgies accompanied the birth of a child in the royal family , and for days " the streets and lanes of the capital appeared like one vast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ condemn . ' But there seems to be no reason why the loosening of the marriage tie on specific occasions should be taken as evidence that at one time the tie did not even exist . 6 . Mother-right. ? Bachofen , the Swiss jurist , in 1897 produced the classic work " Pas Mutterrecht , " in which he pointed out that a system of mother-right prevailed among some peoples and that there was sufficient evidence available to assume that the system everywhere preceded the rise of father-right . A few years later McLennan independently reached the same conclusion , and very recently Briffault brought forth his huge work " The Mothers , " purporting to show the dominant role of women in primitive society . One phase of this role ? which does not necessarily involve either greater power or an easier lot for women than for men ? is the tracing of descent through the mother only . Bachofen thinks this custom is due to the actual supremacy of women , whereas McLennan thinks it due to uncertain paternity . Hartland accepts the theory that mother-right everywhere preceded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in promiscuity . Hobhouse , however , maintains that the patrilineal system is much more prevalent among pastoral than among agricultural savages , which would seem to be a point against the priority of the matrilineal system . But in spite of these distinctions most of the adherents of the mother-right school assume an original state of promiscuity . Westermarck , unconvinced , suggests the possibility that the early ignorance of he existence of paternity might logically account for mother-right , which ice such case would be practically inevitable . But , he continues , if that true why does the system prevail so long after the role of the father icy procreation has become known ? The question forces him to fall back upon certain social conditions for his explanation . He points out that among savages the relationship is much stronger between mother and child than between father and child for several reasons : ( a ) the long sucking period so common among primitives , often lasting four or five years ; ( b ) the frequent cases of separation , with the children always following the mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of providing each wife with a separate hut for herself and her children ; ( ( d ) matrilocal marriage . It is apparent that on this question Westermarck is in danger of confusing cause and effect . After thus disposing of these customs as proof of previous promiscuity , Westermarck gives as his last argument against the theory the fact of // masculine jealousy , which , he claims , would be a positive obstacle to such a state . He denies the statements of Giraud-Teulon , Le Bon , Hartland , and others to the effect that savages are little addicted to jealousy and that such as there is springs from a sense of property ownership rather than jealousy as we know it . He maintains that jealousy , even among savages , springs from sexual desire and hence this sexual jealousy is strongly opposed to the idea of promiscuous intercourse , as far as one 's wife is concerned . Malinowski agrees that a jealous protection of a man 's sexual rights is very common among savages , very severe laws regarding adultery often being found . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only in life but after his death . In some cases , she must die with him ; in others , she may live but is prohibited from remarriage either for a specified period or permanently . This summary of the whole question of primitive promiscuity has necessarily touched upon only the main arguments , omitting the detailed supporting arguments on either side and the endless citations to the customs of specific tribes in every quarter of the globe . To the reader who is likely to want every question definitely settled once and for all , it is not very satisfying to have to admit that neither side has a monopoly on the truth . Westermarck 's arguments are in places contradictory , and he appears unable to see relationships between certain facts that are easily apparent to others . He never even approaches an admission that promiscuity was anywhere probable , and only grudgingly ? with reservations ? admits that it was possible . His final conclusion is that " the hypothesis according to which promiscuity has formed a general stage in the history of mankind . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ within the whole domain of sociological speculation . " To the impartial observer , it appears that Westermarck 's critics have the better of the argument on the question of whether human promiscuity ever existed anywhere . There can be little doubt that it did . The practice is so common in the animal world , and among men the social patterns in this field of relationship are so varied , and environmental and economic factors so diverse , that it would be strange indeed if such a custom had never come into being anywhere among primitives . There is good reason to suppose that it existed in various places , but there is just as good reason to believe that it was not universal . Westermarck ' s main thesis , that whether it ever existed or not there is no proof that i t was a general stage in the social history of all mankind , has yet to be successfully challenged . CONCLUSION In spite of the many questions which of necessity have been left open , this brief review of the natural history of the family leads @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family has not universally gone through a uniform series of stages in its evolution . There is every reason to believe that the development of the family was sometimes random and sometimes opportunistic , as has been the case in the evolution of many other phases of culture . It was once thought that mankind everywhere came up through the Paleolithic , Neolithic , Bronze , and Iron Ages , always in the same order , but now we know that certain African peoples entirely skipped the Bronze Age , going directly from polished stone to iron . Also , it appears logical ( how distasteful it is to give up logic for the truth ! ) that all men first went through the hunting and fishing stage , next the herding stage , and finally entered the argicultural stage ; but we have found peoples who advanced from hunting to agriculture , omitting I he herding stage . The acts of earliest man were frequently inconsequential , and then , as now , sheer accident might determine his course for a considerable time , till his opportunism led him into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the role of borrowing in the development of family forms . Family relationships , sex mores , the status of woman , the t racing of descent ? all these are as truly culture patterns as are agriculture , flint implements , basket weaving , or pottery . The diffusion of culture is not limited to material forms ; in the last analysis , ideas are I he only things transmitted , and a form of regulating the sex relationship could be as truly transmitted as religious beliefs or maize culture . We must therefore admit primitive man 's ingenuity in inventing new family relationships , and his adaptability in modifying existing forms as he came into contact with other forms which for one reason or another Intrigued him . We must give him credit for the fact that in spite of his notorious conservatism he managed to try out , at one time or another , in tic place or another , nearly every conceivable form of family relationship . CHAPTER III ANCIENT FAMILY PATTERNS THE FAMILY IN ANCIENT CHINA Family solidarity is the cornerstone of Chinese culture . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ social organization ? government , labor , religion , and education . To the Westerner the Chinese conception of the family is almost inexplicable . Our impatient , grasping individualism can scarcely compass the group loyalty and self-sacrifice that the Chinese ideal involves . This primacy of the family calls not for self-negation but for self-development ? but selfdevelopment for the good of the family rather than of the individual . This means a different type of living , a different type of thinking than t Ice West has has pointed out that , just as the Romans specialized on law and government and the Greeks on philosophy and art , , the Chinese focused their attention on the , social order . Their constant reflection on human relationships , their sensitiveness to personal attitudes and responsibilities , and their conception of private and public duty all have their roots in family life . Chinese society has been defined a an aggregate of families ; for the sovereign was known as the ' ' head of all families , " and a district magistrate was called the " father and mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ history purports to go back more than 2,000 years B.C. , but not all of the earnest part is authentic . In the early feudal period ( circa 2357-1122 B.C. ) , fact and myth blended in interesting but bewildering confusion . The " Book of History " claims that , the Chinese once lived in promiscuity , knowing their mothers but tact . their fathers . Whether this is true or not , the couvade existed in several parts of China . Marco Polo found it in Yunnan , stating that of t er the birth of a child the man remained in bed 40 days , during which time all his kin visited him . There is evidence that it also existed among the Liaos of Taiping , and that during the couvade the father cared for the chill in every way except nursing . There is still trace of a previous matronymic society in at least one s , et ion of China , though whether there was ever true matriarchy is not // known . Simcoxi thought that matrilocal residence was once practiced and quoted Confucius as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ family of his parents-in-law . But Doolittle ' contended that this custom prevailed only in the cases of rich families who had a daughter but no son and who insisted that whoever married their daughter must come and live with them as a son , a procedure which is found even today . There are also traces in the " Book of Odes " of marriage by capture , but there is nothing authentic on the subject . The successors of the mythical emperor Fu Hsi were supposed to have introduced marriage . Concubinage seems to have been common from earliest times . Marriage Prohibitions. ? One of the earliest marriage prohibitions , which survived to the twentieth century , was that forbidding persons of the same surname to marry . An imperial decree of A.D. 484 states that this rule was promulgated far back in the Chou dynasty , which was from 1122 to 255 B.c . Anyone marrying within his clan received 60 blows , and the marriage was declared null and void . It was feared that such mating would produce weak offspring , in spite of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not afford the slightest presumption of a common ancestor . ' In early times there was an effort to prevent interclass marriage . Particularly were officials forbidden to marry actresses or singing girls . But these prohibitions were nowhere strictly observed , and no caste system resulted therefrom . Officials and nobles heeded them least of all . Said Marco Polo , speaking of Kansu Province , " No matter how base a woman 's descent may be , if she have beauty , she may find a husband among the greatest men of the land , the man paying the girl 's father and mother a great sum of money , according to the bargain that may be made . " 4 A man could not marry his sister 's or brother 's daughter , on pain of severe punishment . In fact , marrying within the prohibited degree of relationship might bring the death penalty ; decapitation was the fate of the man who ventured to marry any of the father 's or grandfather 's former wives . Marriage was prohibited during legal mourning time , but this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mother . ' The proper age for marriage , in the later feudal period ( 1122-221 B.C. ) , was fifteen for the girl and twenty for the young man . Celibacy was // severely frowned upon and in some sections not permitted , for it reflected on the rule of the local officials . Werner ' tells us how Emperor Cheng Kuan ( A.D. 627 ) effectively disposed of the leftovers in the matrimonial market . He issued a decree that , if a young man over twenty and a girl over fifteen were single , the local magistrate should marry them with due ceremony . If they were poor , rich neighbors or relatives were obligated to present them with enough money to get them started . Betrothal and Marriage. ? Marriage was not a personal matter but the fulfillment of one 's duty in preserving the family line . Said the old " Book of Rites , " 2 " Marriage is to make a union between two persons of different families , the object of which is to serve , on the one hand , the ancestors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coming generation . . . . It was a great disgrace for any family name to die out , and this was prevented , when necessary , by adoption , even posthumous adoption being possible . A man took great care that his name and those of his children were entered in the chia pu ( family register ) which was kept by the head of the great-family . If a man became a Buddhist priest , he gave up both surname and secular name and received in their place a holy name . With his surname , he gave up all his rights and duties in the clan . Children were usually married off according to seniority . Though marriage took place quite early , there was no child marriage such as there was in India . Girls very seldom married before *teen , but betrothal usually took place a number of years before mar , ' age . The betrothal of unborn children was forbidden , but between families of longestablished friendship the custom was quite common . The usual age for affiancing children was between seven and fourteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if living , or by the parents , aided by a go-between . The Go-between .  --  The matchmaker 's profession was honorable and called for much discretion . He was charged by the parents to look for a girl more remarkable for virtue than for beauty or for a man more renowned for wisdom than for wealth ; but he knew that a match of economic advantage would seldom be rejected . The negotiations were frequently carried on in the ancestral temple , which lent a religious sanction to t lie marriage . Heredity was not neglected . The san-tai , an account of one 's people for three generations back , was first exchanged , and if the families were not well acquainted each would send a confidential agent to verify the san-tai of the other.3 Also , the day of birth was // important ; for each day represented some animal , and if the boy happened to have been born on the day of the fox and the girl on the day of the goose , they could not marry , for the fox would devour the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the horoscopes were consulted to see if all was propitious . Preliminary presents were then exchanged , the most suitable gift being a wild goose . Wild geese represented a good match , for they were always in pairs and , living in the North in summer and the South in winter , had acquired the harmonizing power of the male and female principle . ' The Marriage Contract and Wedding. ? To be valid the marriage required the consent of the parents on both sides , written into the contract . Also , the bride 's parents must have accepted the regular marriage present from the groom ( really from his family ) to repay them somewhat for their trouble in rearing the girl . ( Possibly this was a survival of bride purchase . ) Likewise the groom 's parents must have agreed to the amount of the dowry offered with the bride . The contract made the whole affair binding as soon as signed , but the exchange of gifts seems to have been the essential element . Once these had been accepted there was no turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ conclusion of the marriage , and the party refusing was punished with 50 blows , after which the marriage was enforced.2 If , after the contract was signed but before marriage , it was discovered that the bride 's father had practiced deceit , he was punished with SO blows , the contract was voided , and the presents returned . If the groom 's father was guilty of such misstatement , the punishment was even more severe , and the bride kept her presents . If fraud was discovered after marriage , it constituted grounds for divorce . The marriage day was fixed by the bride 's parents , and between betrothal and marriage there must elapse for the emperor one year , for great vassals six months , and for the common people one month . If the bride 's family delayed unduly after the wedding date agreed upon , the groom had the right to kidnap her with the help of friends . This was occasionally permitted in poor families in order to avoid the expense of an elaborate wedding ; for the ceremonies lasted for several days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were over . But forcible abduction of the bride before the set wedding day was a punishable offense.3 Betrothal was considered almost as binding as marriage , and if a betrothed girl died , mourning could be performed as for a married woman . // For the young man , marriage was the " completing of this house " ; for the girl it was a " going out of the door , " that is , leaving the household of her parents to enter that of her parents-in-law . During the ceremony the couple knelt together before the ancestral shrine of the groom , the bride thus signifying her allegiance to his household and his family line . All the other ceremonies being finished the bride and groom ate together of the same food , to show that they were now one body . Passing from the house the husband preceded the wife , establishing at the beginning the right relationship . Concubinage. ? In the later feudal period ( 1122-221 B.c. ) when the emperor married he was to marry 9 women at once ? 1 wife and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( 221 B.c. ? A.D. 221 ) the number of wives the emperor should marry was increased to 12 , 1 for each of the 12 months of Heaven , but all must be married at office " to avoid lewdness . " It appears , however , that this legal number was often exceeded , for in the Han dynasty even a prince was permitted 40 concubines . Lesser persons were strictly limited . A great minister could have 1 wife and 2 concubines , a scholar 1 wife and 1 concubine . The legal wife became a member of her husband 's clan and worshiped his ancestors . She brought with her a portion from her family , over which , in many cases , she retained control . In case of widowhood , she became the natural administrator of her husband 's individual estate , with certain rights in the clan property should his estate be insignificant . She was mistress of the household and held sway over the concubines , or secondary wives . Among the noble and official classes , she shared her husband 's honors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the performance of his official duties . No noble , no official , and no person with a literary degree could give his daughter in marriage except with the status of a wife . The concubine , or secondary wife , was of distinctly lower status than the wife . She was frankly purchased , and the contract , which had to be In writing , was called " an agreement for selling a person . " The price was always stated , though often it was nominal . No marriage ceremony was necessary , the marriage being consummated by the residence of the concubine in her husband 's household . She was subordinate to the wife , and could not be raised to the status of wife during the lifetime of the primary wife . Nor could the latter be degraded to the rank of concubine . However , the concubine worshiped her husband 's ancestors , and her children were legitimate . The Patriarchal Form of the Family. ? The patriarch was the absolute hind of the family . There is no term in China corresponding to that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much power over him family as had the Roman father . He could sell , expose , or even kill // his children , though public opinion would not tolerate the selling or killing of a grown son . The father could lose his absolute authority over his children in four ways : ( 1 ) by marriage ( of the daughter ) , ( 2 ) by sale into adoption , ( 3 ) by allowing a son or daughter to enter a religious order , ( 4 ) by exposing the young child . ( The finder could lawfully adopt any such child under three years of age . ) Thus the father 's power over his daughter lasted only till her marriage , but over his son it normally continued through life , unless the son went into government service . There was no such thing as the son legally " becoming of age " during the lifetime of his father . Indeed , the father was subject to the authority of the grandfather , if he were still living . It was the custom for sons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their families under one roof as long as their parents lived . The head of this great household was the oldest male member . It was not uncommon for a household to consist of four or five generations . But in spite of the fact that the father was practically absolute in authority , in theory the land belonged to the family rather than to the individual , and the " Book of Rites " stated that fields and lands once assigned could not be sold . Probably this meant they could not be sold without the consent of the clan council , for such seems to have been the common practice . Ancestor Worship. ? Perhaps the strongest factor binding the Chinese family into a unit was ancestor worship . The commonest man prayed to his ancestors even as the emperor prayed to his . From infancy the child 's nurture was filled with reverence for his forebears . When young he was bound with intense loyalty to the service of his ancestors , and when old he looked forward to receiving such honor from his descendants . This was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ population lived in villages , which greatly facilitated family solidarity and ancestor worship . Frequently , a village was wholly or mostly composed of one clan and was called after the name of the clan inhabiting it . A clan sometimes lived in the same village for centuries , while other clans less gregarious were scattered in various villages . The ancestral hall was the magnet that drew the loyalty of every member of the clan . In addition to the property separately owned by the various families , the clan as a whole sometimes possessed property , the income from which went for the upkeep of the ancestral hall and the repair of graves . Twice a year ? spring and autumn ? the tombs of 1 he ancestors were visited by the whole clan , and each family in addition visited the tombs of its immediate ancestors . Such days were pi ' Hie holidays for the whole clan ; feasts were provided and pocket money distributed . // Each family kept a chia-li-pu ( book of family laws ) recording the family genealogy back to the most remote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were posted , together with their penalties , in the ancestral hall and were enforced by the tribunal of elders . Any income from ancestral property had to be divided equally among all the male members of the clan , regardless of age , and all widows . These benefits might be in money or in food ; but whether the value was great or small , they were prized more for the fact that they linked the person with the great-family than for their intrinsic value . The bond was strengthened by the fact that only those present at the ancestral gathering received such benefits . In South China a double portion of t lie benefits from ancestral property went to clan members who were over fifty-nine years of age . Some clans even had a sort of progressive old-age pension , those who had reached sixty-nine receiving a treble share , those of seventy-nine a quadruple share , and so on . ' Some clans also provided for maternity benefits , widows ' pensions , free medical aid , and free burial , thus anticipating our modern social insurance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ancestral hall even included free education for t lie children of the clan . The government of the ancestral hall rested in the hands of 12 members elected annually and representing in proper proportion the several lines of descendants . They managed the ancestral property and every three years rented out any land it included . They could not dispose of any of this land unless three-fourths of the fathers of families in the clan approved , the proceeds to be invested in other land or else divided equally among all the male members of the clan , regardless of age , and the widows . The Position of Women. ? The status of women in China was a paradox . Chinese literature is full of admirable sentiments regarding the relation between husband and wife , and yet nothing could hide the wife 's low estate . She might be loved and treated kindly , but she was of an entirely different order from the male . She was honored in the home , and yet she had no authority except through her mate . Her name was even placed on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more as his complement than as a person in her own right . She was sometimes well t mated and contented , but sometimes , too , her lot was unbearably hard . I low firmly established her inferiority was may be seen by the fact that it was embedded in the religious beliefs . The " I Chang , " which receives t he veneration accorded to scripture , teaches that the original principle out of which heaven and earth evolved was a united male and female principle , the Yang and the Yin . But these two parts separated , the male becoming the heavenly principle and the female the earthly . " The // male principle is represented by light and the female by darkness ; the male by strength , and the female by weakness ; the male by wisdom , the female by ignorance . " 1 Confucius did his share to hold woman down . " Women are as different from men as earth is from heaven . . . women are , indeed , human beings , but they are of a lower state @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of nature that women should be kept under the control of men and not allowed any will of their own . " Finally , he made it clear that woman could never hope to change her status , all through eternity . " In the other world the condition of affairs is exactly the same , for family laws govern there as well as here . " 2 Confucius also enunciated the three obediences of woman , whereby when young she must be obedient to her father and elder brother ; when married , to her husband ; when her husband died , . to her son.3 A stupid wife was by no means undesirable , for a wise woman was more likely to be a curse than a blessing . One of the odes4 expresses this idea thus : A wise man builds up the wall , But a wise woman overthrows it . Admirable may be the wise woman , But she is no better than an owl . A woman with a long tongue Is like a stepping stone to disorder . Disorder does not come down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whom come no lessons , no instruction , Are women and eunuchs . The lot of the girl was harder than that of the boy from the very beginning . At birth she was likely to be much less wanted than the boy , and hence much more likely to be sold or killed . Some writers have undoubtedly exaggerated infanticide in China , but even the most conservative figures are startling . It was of course worse in some places than in others , and in some times than others , famine greatly increasing it . Between A.D. 221 and 589 , female infanticide and the sale of children ( usually girls ) into slavery became so common that an imperial decree was issued against both practices , and yet both have persisted to some degree to the present time . // The hardness of life for the Chinese girl , among the poorer classes , was increased by the custom of the bride-to-be entering the household of her future mother-in-law at a very tender age , long before marriage . I n this way the mother was eased very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , evaded the expense of a wedding . The custom %vas also advantageous to the mother-in-law , for it gave her a new servant years earlier than otherwise and at such a young age that she could be t rained easily to her method of work . Sometimes the girl was treated kindly and accepted in the new home as a daughter , but often she was t rented as the meanest of drudges , a virtual slave . Even Chinese writers deplore the condition of such girls . When she finally married , and especially after she had borne a son , her status improved . The double standard was fully recognized and practically never questioned by wives . The principle is clearly set forth in a passage from one of the odes:3 Ah , thou young lady , Seek no licentious pleasure with a gentleman . When a gentleman indulges in such a pleasure , Something may still be said for him ; When a lady does so Nothing can be said for her . The wife could not leave the house without the husband 's permission . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ severely enough to injure her . In case of adultery the husband could kill both his wife and her paramour , if caught in the very act , and for thus maintaining the purity of the family he was invariably rewarded by the local official and praised by the people.2 He merely appeared before the magistrate and explained why he had killed the guilty parties . He then received a nominal punishment of 20 blows , a present of a roll of red cloth , and 20,000 cash ( equal to 20 Chinese dollars ) . But the irate husband could have no help in the double slaying , for anyone helping him was guilty of murder . Neither could he do any halfway job , for if he killed only one of the guilty pair he himself was guilty of murder ! 3 The husband 's right to dlestroy the guilty pair had to be exercised at once in order to be valid ; otherwise , the offenders were brought before the court and bambooed but not put to death . The wife could then be sold into slavery to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ required to divorce her , and in no case could she marry her seducer. // Widows could remarry after three years of mourning , but it was considered such a disgrace that only the very poor with whom necessity overrode convention dared to disregard the moral law which bound the loyal wife to her husband even in death . If the widow returned to her own parents , she lost all her rights in her husband 's property , including what she brought with her . She usually took over the management of his estate or , if his parents were living , remained with them as their daughter . It was a great honor to a family to have a widowed daughterin-law who steadily refused to remarry , and conversely it brought great dishonor to the family if she married . If a wife became a widow after thirty years of age and remained one for 30 years , her virtue was so great that she was eligible for an imperial reward in the form of an arched gateway , erected where she lived . After receiving such a reward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arches were numerous in some parts of China . Divorce. ? It is not known when divorce was first legalized in China , but it was in existence when the code was promulgated in 253 B.C. Confucius is said to have divorced his legal wife , his son and grandson following his example , though some writers deny this . There were at least 10 grounds on which a man could divorce his wife : ( 1 ) fraud in the marriage contract ; ( 2 ) adultery or dissolute conduct ; ( 3 ) disobedience or unfilial conduct toward the husband 's parents ; ( 4 ) barrenness ; ( 5 ) jealousy ; ( 6 ) incurable disease ( leprosy ? ) ; ( 7 ) talkativeness ; ( 8 ) theft ; ( 9 ) leaving the house against the will of the husband ; ( 10 ) desertion . Legge 's translation of the Chinese classics shows that most of these reasons for divorce might be overruled in court by any one of the following considerations : ( 1 ) if the woman had been taken from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; ( 2 ) if she had passed with her husband through the three years of mourning for her parents ; ( 3 ) if the husband had become rich after being poor . Furthermore , too frequent divorce was frowned upon . Kuan Tzu wrote that a scholar who had divorced three wives should be expelled from the district . There is evidence that in the very early times ( later feudal period , 1122-221 B.C. ) divorce for trivial offenses was common and might even be considered commendable . Cheng Tzu , explaining the " Chou Rites , " declared that the ancients were so honest and chivalrous that a man of honor would not divorce his wife for serious cause lest it ruin her life , but only for slight cause , in accordance with the old proverb : " In divorcing a wife one should make her marriageable . " Divorced women usually were permitted to go back to their parents , but the preceding proverb would indicate that remarriage was common in that early day . It appears that divorced concubines at first were not allowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ absolute monarchy , 221 B.C.-A.D. 221 ) a decree was issued giving them the right of remarriage . But the wife also had some rights of divorce , though they were limited . She could divorce her husband : ( 1 ) if he became a leper ; ( 2 ) if he deserted her , remaining away three years , and if meanwhile none of his relatives had offered her any support . ' To these two commonly accepted grounds , Mollendorff adds three other causes for which the wife could sue for divorce , but with no assurance that it would be granted : ( 1 ) if she had been deceived by false statements in the marriage contract ; ( 2 ) if her husband had beaten her cruelly ; ( 3 ) if her husband was willing to divorce her at her own request . In support of the last-named cause , Werner tells of a woman who wanted to divorce her husband because he had become very poor . He consented and wrote her an ode which she took I o the magistrate . The divorce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the bamboo . Compensatory Factors. ? But when all has been said of woman 's low estate , the paradoxical fact remains that she often received a great deal of love and respect both from husband and children . Theoretically she was in complete subjection to her husband , but actually she often stood almost on a basis of equality with him . Frequently she ruled her domain as completely as he ruled his , and the division of labor amounted to a division of authority as well . As far back as the " Book of Rules " we timid the admonition " Men should not speak of the inside nor women of the outside " ; i.e. , although the men held complete sway on outside matters , they should leave the affairs of the household entirely to their wives . So in practice the mother was the center of the domestic life , and to a considerable extent she controlled the family . She usually decided when the children should start to school and had a large part in finding a wife or husband for her son or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managing the affairs of the home she was responsible for directing the punctilious relations with relatives and friends and for the proper observance of all ceremonies in connection with birth , death , marriage , festivals , and the proper degrees of respect due from one member of the family to another . As the head of a large household , including her married sons and their families , she held considerable authority over no mean domain . In such circumstances the earnings of all went into a common purse , and sometimes ( at least in agricultural families ) the mother held the purse strings . Upon the death of the father his full authority as head of the family passed to her , in contradiction to the statement of Confucius that in such a situation she should pass under the authority of her eldest son . This authority of son 1 ' bid . // over mother may have been true in earliest times , but it certainly did not obtain during the great stretch of recorded Chinese history . In any dispute between his wife and his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , on the grounds that he could get another wife but could never get another mother . But the greatest honor accorded woman was for her function of motherhood . Among a people whose whole system of living was based solidly on ancestor worship , the role of the mother in producing sons was bound to be glorified . The supreme gift of a wife to her husband was a son . It immediately raised her in his estimation as well as that of the community , for she had now performed her chief function , that for which she had come into being . There are many passages in Chinese literature that indicate mutual love and respect between husband and wife . The fact of woman 's low status legally , socially , and religiously did not prevent the normal working of loyalty and devotion , for , as Bashford remarks , human nature is often better than human laws . The odes present many pictures of such devotion : the loving thoughts of the wife whose husband is away in the war , and her great joy and pride @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's mistreatment on the ground that his mind may be unsettled ; the man who considers his happiness with his own humble bride to be just as great as the happiness in famous families ; and the soldier 's lament because he could not fulfill his vows to his wife to grow old with her . This last was the conjugal ideal ? to grow old together ? a hope that gave dignity to life . In one of the odes the wife of a peasant speaks to her husband of the joys of working in daily fellowship with him and ends with the gentle assurance : And I will hope to grow old with you . Your lute in your hands Will emit its quiet , pleasant tones . Filial Relations. ? Mencius declared that love for one 's parents should take precedence over love for one 's country . Perhaps no other saying could show more clearly the importance attached to filial devotion . It was the first duty of man , supreme and unchallenged . Children , from the dawn of understanding , were supposed to show the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? the mother as well as the father . Pampered children are not entirely unknown among any people , but on the whole Chinese children showed their parents the greatest reverence , and it was seldom that a boy or girl , even when grown , wouId dare to oppose the parents in any important matter . Indulgence in small affairs did not diminish the insistence of parents on the most ' Inquest toning obedience in major twitters. // Mencius considered service to one 's parents the " richest fruits of love . " Countless stories are found in Chinese history and literature relating the devotion of children to their parents : of the boy who wept when punished by his aged mother because the feeble blows betokened her failing strength ; of Tung Yung who sold himself into slavery in order to pay his father 's funeral expenses ; of Wu Meng who allowed the mosquitos to sting him so they would not worry his parents ; and Wang Hsiang , who melted the ice with his naked body in order to secure fresh fish for his mother . A @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a soldier whose duties prevented him from performing his rightful service to his parents : Than to live an orphan , It would be better to have been long dead . Fatherless , who is there to rely on ? Motherless , who is there to depend on ? When I go abroad , I carry my grief with me ; When I come home I have no one to go to . Oh my father , who begat me ! Oh my mother , who nourished me . Ye indulged me , ye fed me , Ye held me up , ye supported me . Ye looked after me , ye never left me , Out and in ye bore me in your arms . If I would return your kindness , It is like great Heaven , illimitable . ' Unbrotherly conduct was second only to unfilial conduct in baseness . The greatest respect and love were to be manifested at all times by the younger brother for his elder brothers . Indeed , unfilial and unbrotherly conduct was considered worse than outright crime . One of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a prince , deplores the terrible crimes of robbery and murder but goes on to say that although tole ! ) great criminals are greatly abhorred they are far less detestable than the unfilial and unbrotherly . Property Rights and Inheritance. ? The eldest male in the household ( father , grandfather or great-grandfather , as the case might be ) was the legal head of the family , and his signature , in the name of the family , was necessary on any transfers of property or other documents . Married sons were not entitled to hold property in their own name during the life of their parents , and no new family or household could be legally registered as long as either parent lived . Some families had budgets setting // aside certain sums for dowries for the girls , prizes for scholarship , and pensions for the aged . The wife could not possess property of her own as long as her husband lived . If her husband divorced her , even what property she might have inherited remained with him , though in practice she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The husband was not liable for the debts of his wife contracted before marriage unless she had no family when he married her . On the death of the husband his full authority passed to his wife , unless she wished to pass it on to a grown son . She could manage the estate , alone or with the help of one or more sons , but her right in the property was only a life interest . If she divided the property during her lifetime , she received a double share and her sons equal single shares . Any unmarried daughters remaining in the home received nothing but would be provided with a dowry at marriage . When both parents died , the authority temporarily passed to the eldest son . If there were younger brothers and sisters too young to marry , the household would be held together by this eldest son until there was no longer any necessity of so doing . When the property was finally divided , it went in equal shares to the sons , the daughters getting nothing but suitable dowries , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eldest son had male issue before his younger brothers did , and during the lifetime of either parent , he received a double portion of the estate . If any brother died before the division of the property , his share was divided equally among his male children . If the parents left no son , the nearest male relative ( one generation younger than the deceased ) became his son by fictitious adoption . Such a circumstance rarely occurred , however , for if a man 's wife did not give him a son he might divorce her and marry again , or take a concubine , or even " hire " a widow for such time as was necessary to secure a son from her . This last practice was not so common as the other two . If any or all of these expedients failed , he could adopt a son . The most favored adoption was that of a nephew , who became for all purposes the same as a son . FAMILY PATTERNS IN ANCIENT INDIA India has long been a land of contrasts : the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of magnificent wealth and unspeakable poverty , of Taj Mahal and mud hut . Yet there was always one thing on which prince and pauper agreed ? that sex was the central theme of life . Reproduction was the supreme fact of the universe , and marriage the first dirty of man . The ceremony might vary according to dist rict or caste , hut , whatever its form it marked the most important stet , in if man 's life . An unmarried man ( unless he remained single from pious // motives ) had little social status and was not consulted on important ' natters , for he had shirked the duty of perpetuation . Marriage was an impersonal matter , having nothing to do with the wishes or preferences of one man and woman and their pursuit of happiness . It was not the joining of two free wills in a personal relationship of their own choosing and for their own contentment , but rather " the connection of two incarnations of the world spirit during an unreal moment of illusory existence . " ' Thus marriage was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as in China ; it was a sacrament . ' Prue , the family contract might be made , but it was secondary in importance to the fulfillment of duty to the Divine Spirit of the universe . Certain classes of priests were authorized by the sacred books to exercise the proper magical arts necessary to the right selection of mates . Cosmic harmony was further assured by the contribution of the astrologists , and religious rites gave final consecration to the union . The Accent on Sex. ? The Hindu preoccupation with sex should not imply that marriage was merely a zask for sexual indulgence and that passion ruled supreme . On the contrary the Hindu was adjured to shun passion , for it was considered earthly and debasing , and to maintain only a cool and controlled affection toward his wife . This sounds paradoxical and can be understood only in the light of Hindu philosophy and religion . Desire of every kind was to be suppressed , for only thus could one find peace and eventually attain Nirvana . To the Occidental it is the height of illogic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of desirelessness . Likewise , since life was considered a whole and individuality implied limitation , it would seem inconsistent that the desire to pass on the torch of life should be the highest motive for sexual intercourse , for birth separated one from the whole ) of life and subjected one to the errors of isolated action . Yet such was the doctrine , and marriage carried not only the privilege but also the obligation of sexual activity ? but kept free from passion . But since ideal and practice seldom coincide , it is not surprising that the antithetical doctrine of stimulating yet spiritualizing the sex urge was difficult of attainment , and that sexual excess was a common result . Fertility was considered so essential that no opportunity of ensuring it , was to be neglected . The ritu ? the period of the wife 's monthly cleansing ? could not pass by unused , for not only was her sex desire strongest at that period but also she was most likely to conceive . The husband was obligated to perform his marital duty at that time ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to heaven . He who failed to cohabit with his wife during the ritu was guilty of sin , and especially horrible // punishments would befall him in the other world . Furthermore the wife , so lacking in rights in most matters , had a holy right to demand intercourse during the ritu , for she knew that she would be despised if she did not bear children . ' The Position of Women. ? The two great epics of ancient India ? the " Mahabharata " and the " Ramayana " ? are rich in data on the status of woman . The " Mahabharata " pictures the social life of India some 1,500 years ago . Then as now , girl babies were not welcome , but a good father made the most of his " misfortune " and sought to marry off his daughter fittingly . Misfortune she was indeed , for she brought danger to three families : her mother 's , her father 's , and the family into which she married . Various passages of the epic speak of the daughter as a misfortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her very birth . A typical passage2 follows : " The eldest brother is the same as the father , the wife and son are a man 's own body , his servants are the man 's shadow , the daughter is the bitterest woe . " This prejudice , however , was often modified by the natural affection of parents for offspring , and girls received kindly treatment in many families . Yet they were shown little of the attention showered on boys , and their lot was unenviable at best . They were quiet and submissive and early learned the duties of the household , knowing that while still of tender years they would be given over to the desires of a man usually several times their age . There was no thought of rebellion in their hearts , for they followed the only social pattern of which they had any knowledge . In most respects the status of woman was even lower in ancient India than in China , and perhaps as low as among any people of whom we have knowledge . Woman was created for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wants . She had no existence outside of man . When she married , her husband was her god , and she yielded to his every wish . Hers was the passive role , her greatest virtue the worshipful adoration she accorded her husband . Nothing better illustrates her abject submission to her lord and master than the rules of wifely conduct prescribed in the well-known " Padmapurana . " These rules3 are reputed to have been formulated by the penitent Vasishta , who recommends their observance to every faithful wife . There is no other god on earth for a woman than her husband . The most excellent of all the good works that she can do is to seek to please him by manifesting perfect obedience to him . Therein should lie her sole rule of life . // Be her husband deformed , aged , infirm , offensive in his manners ; let him also be choleric , debauched , immoral , a drunkard , a gambler ; let him frequent places of ill repute , live in open sin with other women , have no affection whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; let him live without honor ; let him be blind , ( leaf , dumb , or crippled ; in a word , let his defects be what they may , a wife should always look upon him as her god , should lavish on him all her attention and care , paying no heed whatsoever to his character and giving him no cause whatsoever for displeasure ... . If her husband laugh , she must laugh ; if he be sad , she must be sad ; if he weep , she must weep ; if he ask questions , she must answer . Thus will she give proof of her good disposition . .. . A wife must eat only after her husband has had his fill . If the latter fast , she shall fast too ; if he touch not his food , she also shall not touch it ; if he be in affliction , she shall be so too ; if he be cheerful , she shall share his joy . . . . If her husband go away anywhere and ask her to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tell her to remain at home , 1et her not leave the house during his absence . Until his return she shall not bathie , or anoint her head with oil , or clean her teeth , or pare her nails ; she shall eau but once a day , shall not lie down on a bed , or wear new clothes , or adorn her forehead with any of the ordinary marks .... In the presence of her husband , a wife must not look about her , but must keep her eyes fixed on him , in readiness to receive his orders . When he speaks , she must not interrupt him or speak to anybody else ; when he calls her , she must leave everything and run to him . If he sing , she must be in ecstasy ; if he dance , she must look at him with delight ; if he speak of learned things , she must listen to him with admiration . . . . If her husband flies into a passion , threatens her , abuses her grossly , even bats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay hold of his hands , kiss them , and beg his pardon . . . . From the above , as from innumerable other passages in Hindu literature , it is clear that woman had but one vocation in life ? to minister to man ' s every comfort and pleasure and to bear him children . The husband frequently called his wife " servant " or even " slave , " whereas she called him " my master " and " my lord " ; to call him by his name was too familiar and would incur his anger . ' There were two reasons why t he wife should not eat until her lord had his fill . First , it showed her fun ty and emphasized his superiority ; second , she could absorb virtue filch his plate . In South India it was believed that the husband , by meditations and " severe austerities , " became a storehouse of magnetic force , and during a meal his plate was saturated with his magnetism . By eating from his plate the wife absorbed into her system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ' // With the exception of the courtesans who sang and danced in the temple and at public gatherings , women were not taught to read . For a respectable woman to learn to read was considered disgraceful , and even if she secretly learned she was afraid to admit it . Women were considered so inferior intellectually as to be incapable of thought on any higher matters . It was therefore all the more exasperating when a woman cleverly used her alleged low mentality as an excuse for her errors . If she found it difficult to give a reasonable explanation for some mistake for which she was being admonished , she would fall back upon the excuse " After all , I am only a woman , " to which there was no possible retort . Sutteeisrn. ? The custom by which the wife was burned on the funeral pyre of her husband was fairly common in some times and places but was actually practiced far less frequently than some writers have implied , or else India could not have swarmed with widows as it has for centuries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the end . Before a widow could attain the honor of such sacrifice , she had to pass several tests of determination in which most failed , doubtless to their secret satisfaction . If a woman expressed a desire to become suttee , her relatives immediately sought to dissuade her . If they failed , her friends interposed , and finally priests were called in to break down her will . As a last resort they pictured to her the horror of the flames ; if she firmly withstood this prospect of suffering , she had her way . Having passed the tests , she became holy through her spirit of perfect devotion , and the awed spectators called upon her to bless them . She first worshiped at the temple , removing all personal adornments and laying them at the feet of the gods . Then she ascended the funeral pyre , where her friends adjusted her hair and adorned her with wreaths and garlands . After throwing handfuls of cowries , betel-nuts , and plantains to the crowd , she laid herself by the corpse of her husband , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was applied simultaneously in several places , and , the pyre having been saturated with oil , death came almost instantly . The Brighter Side of Marriage. ? The picture of womanhood in India was not entirely one of shadows ; it had its light spots as well . A man might look down on his wife , but he was dependent upon her . He was not complete without her . She was the right half and her husband the left half of a whole individual . They were as " one soul functioning in two bodies . " In fact many important Hindu ceremonies were mill and void if a man performed them without the company of his wife . If the husband gave a gift to another , the wife made the transfer effective by pouring a spoonful of water on the gift ; if a daughter was being given in marraige the formalities were of no avail without her mother 's particiANCIENT // pation.3 It was through his wife that a man did good works and acquired riches and honor . To a certain degree this was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hymn in the " Rig-Veda " 2 which charges the bride to be mistress over her father-in-law and mother-in-law . Such advice was a noble and generous gesture , but the " Mahabharata " in several places justifies lying to a woman , especially at a wedding ! Man 's domination over his wife was complete enough to satisfy even the most consummate egotist , but it was often exercised in moderation . Conjugal exploitation was common but certainly not universal . Though couples were mated without the slightest respect to their wishes , they frequently became greatly attached to each other and lived in lifelong devotion . True , such unions occurred more often in poetry than in real life , but the ideal nevertheless existed and was occasionally approached . Quoting again from the epics , Meyer3 gives ' s a picture of the ideal relationship between husband and wife : She is a wife who is skillful in the house ; she is a wife who has children ; she is a wife whose life is her husband . . . . The wife is the best friend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wife accomplishes deeds ; . . . he that has a wife has joy . . . . He t hat has a wife finds trust ; therefore the wife is the surest refuge . . . . If the roan is burning in sorrows of the soul and is sick with bodily ills , then does he find comfort by his wife , as that which is tortured in heat does in water . Even t he man in the clutches of hot rage will do nothing harsh to women , if he considers that on them depend the pleasures of love , joy , and what is good . As the field on which the self grows up , women are an elver-holy thing ; for what power have even the Rishis to produce children without a woman ! This advice to husbands smacks strongly of " enlightened selfinterest , " but at least it constituted a motive for good treatment and was not as self-calculating as the epics would lead us to believe . In another passage the husband , after showing how perfectly his wife ministers to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to him , speaks of her as the most tender and loving companion one could have . " He for whom a beloved wife lives , he has a home t here , even if it be only on the root of a tree ; even a palace without her is a wilderness . " 4 Attitude toward Polygyny. ? Polygyny was tolerated among officials of high rank . Kings were allowed five legitimate wives , and rajahs , princes , statesmen , and certain others were permitted more than one . lint even when practiced by the great , polygyny was looked upon as counter to law and custom and not to be easily condoned . Even the // principal Hindu gods had only one wife , though they sometimes had extramarital adventures . If a man of inferior rank took several women , only one could be his legitimate wife , the others rating only as concubines . Not unless his wife proved to be barren or bore female children only , could a man legally take a second wife , and then only after he had obtained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Marriage. ? Marriage was not an individual matter ; it was the race , not the individual , that counted . The parties supposedly most interested were not even consulted . Often they were too young to have any choice ; and , besides , cosmic harmony and family advantage were far more important than personal wishes . In theory , harmony with the universe was first in importance , but in practice it frequently got badly mixed with family advantage . The father of the girl first sent a message to the boy 's father , suggesting that the children be married . Among the Jats , if the boy 's father found the offer attractive he sent the family priest to the girl 's home to measure her height , judge her appearance , and observe any other important factor . If the report was favorable , the genealogies were next studied to see that no prohibited degree of relationship existed . Then the horoscopes were consulted by specialists to see that the marriage would not run counter to the appointed courses of the stars . Sometimes the astrologers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do so , being very skillful in judging the fees their clients would stand for . When the delay was too great , the exasperated parents bribed them into giving an acceptable decision . ' When the betrothal was finally agreed upon , it was considered binding by both parties . There was usually a period of years between betrothal and marriage ; an uneven number like 3 , 5 , or 7 was preferable , for the even numbers were considered unlucky . It was possible but undesirable to marry a woman of lower caste , for the husband dropped to her caste . However , if he first married a woman of his own caste and later one of a lower , he did not lose caste . In the double period 1000 B.C. ? A.D. 500 there were from six to eight different forms of marriage recognized , though not all were considered orthodox . There was the form for the marriage of a girl with a priest , that for marriage of a girl with a student , and others . Marriage based on either seduction or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were common . Occasionally a man got a bargain ; if another tried to deceive him by showing him one girl and giving him another , he // was entitled to both girls for the price of one ! As among various other peoples , a young man without the price of a bride could hire out to his prospective father-in-law , and for seven years ' labor he received the ( laughter in marriage . There were seemingly four other ways in which the financial end of the marriage could be arranged . ( 1 ) A rich man sometimes refused the sum to which , as the father of the bride , he was entitled and paid all the expenses of the marriage . Such a course brought him great honor . ( 2 ) The parents of both parties might share the expenses equally . ( 3 ) The bride 's parents might insist that the bridegroom 's parents pay for the bride and all the wedding costs . ( 4 ) Very poor people who were not in any position to bargain could only hand over the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay at lest something for her . ' The wedding was always a religious affair , and the ceremonies involved were many and complicated . When the sacred hour approached , with an astrologer consulting the water clock for the exactly propitious time and the priests chanting Sanskrit verses , the bride and groom sat with joined hands . At just the right moment they arose , went around the sacred fire , and took the seven steps that bound them together forever . The bridegroom then turned to his wife , saying , " Oh , wife , give your heart to my work , make your mind agreeable to mine . May the god Brahaspati make you pleasing to me. " 2 The festivities connected with the wedding lasted anywhere from a few days to a month . When at length all was over , the bride ( usually extremely young ) returned home wit h her parents , who kept her well secluded until she attained puberty and was able to fulfill all the functions of a wife . The bridegroom 's parents then came for her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life gradually , she was taken back to her parents after it month , and for the first few years ( or until she had a child ) she lived alternately with her parents and her husband.3 However , this seeming concern for the girl was not always so great as it appeared . Marriage was practically indissoluble . Husband and wife did not even think in terms of separation . It was said that only the will of God , Through the instrument of death , could grant divorce , but this was not literally true . In some sections , at least , a wife guilty of adultery could he divorced , but such an offense was so unthinkable in most castes that it was almost unknown . A marriage could be annulled if the parties to it were found to be related in the prohibited degree . Child Marriage. ? The marriage of young children was unusual in the very early history of India but later became extremely common . In the // leave a son behind him was an offense serious enough to deprive him of happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt a boy from among his own relatives , but if he found none he considered worthy he would secure a son from some poor father of his own caste who was burdened with too large a family . The adopted son renounced all rights to any share in the property of his natural father and acquired the sole right of inheritance from his adopted father . On the death of the latter the adopted son received the full inheritance , liabilities as well as assets , which meant that he was bound to pay any debts his foster father had left . THE FAMILY IN EARLY EGYPT Family life in ancient China and India in the East and Greece and Rome in the West had much in common . All four were similar in patriarchal form , horror of incest , and certain other features . The early Egyptians , however , had a family organization that differed greatly from these others in some of the most fundamental features . Authentic information on marriage and family forms among the ancient Egyptians is decidedly limited , but enough is known to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The details can not be filled in , but perhaps their omission will not prevent us from getting a general view of the family life of that time . Matrilineal Descent and Inheritance. ? That feature of the picture which first catches the eye is the fact that descent was traced through the mother and could always be traced back further on the female side of the family than on the male side . Property , also , descended through the female line , though it seems to have been controlled , at least for all practical purposes , by the men . This may or may not indicate that tine matriarchy prevailed at an earlier time , for , as shown in the preceding chapter , matrilineal descent and inheritance do not necessarily imply female dominance over the male corresponding to the patriarchal system of male dominance . ' In such a society , we might reasonably expect to find matrilocal residence , also , but there is no mention of it . It of course existed , without the necessity of being enforced , in the ease of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ scope than this . We do know , however , that the youth looked to his maternal grandfather , rather than I o his own father , as his most powerful protector and the one most vitally interested in his success . As one of the old writings2 puts it , " When he // is placed at the head of the court of justice , then the father of his mother thanks God . " The system of royal succession wavered back and forth from one line descent to the other . Petrie ' thinks that prior to the First Dynasty e succession was in the female line . In the First Dynasty it was a e succession ; in the Second it was again female ; but by the Sixth nasty the succession of sons was in force again . Fixed property descended by the female line , from mother to daughter or to the daughter 's - I1 . The kingdom itself followed the same rule for a considerable time . Theoretically , at least , it was the property of the royal daughters , and whoever became king @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The question of legitimacy , in respect to the inheritance of property , obscure . There was but one legal wife in most cases , and Breasted ys the women of the harem had no legal claim upon their lord . Wilkinhowever , definitely states that no distinction was made between the spring of the wife and those of any other woman , all sharing the inheritance on equal grounds . Brother-sister Marriage. ? Another distinctive feature of Egyptian rriage was that the rule against union between close relatives ? a rule common among both primitive and civilized peoples as to be almost niversal ? was wholly lacking . In the love songs the words " brother 111 sister " have the same significance as " husband and wife . " There none of the common horror of incest . Indeed , not only was the It her permitted to marry his sister , but such marriage was customary . vend primitive peoples have been known to make exceptions for such breeding in the royal family , but in Egypt brother-sister marriage was limited to royalty or nobility . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of society.3 Many of the Ptolemies married sisters , and by the Roman period the custom had become so common that two-thirds of all the citizens of Arisnoe were said to be thus closely terniarried . This was evidently justified by the example of the gods , ( ) siris set the pattern by marrying his sister Isis.4 The High Status of Women. ? The position of the wife in ancient Egypt was remarkably high . Most writers state that the wife was on equality with the husband and was always treated with the greatest // consideration . This may have been due partly to the fact that property descended through the woman and courtesy paid dividends , and partly to the fact that often husband and wife were also brother and sister and had been reared together . But whatever the cause , the Egyptian wife held a position of honor and was respected by husband and children alike . The pictures frequently show the husband and wife in an affectionate attitude , seated together on the double chair so common in Egyptian houses , with the children grouped about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy . In contrast with the seclusion in which Greek women were kept , Egyptian women shared the work and recreation of their husbands . They accompanied their husbands on their hunting and fishing expeditions , one of the most familiar scenes depicted on the monuments being that of husband and wife on the Nile fens , fishing and fowling from a papyrus skiff . The wife 's role was chiefly that of spectator , but at least she was one of the party . Scenes of husband and wife entertaining guests are also common . The wife also shared the work and responsibilities of her husband , whether he were of high or low estate . In royal edicts and documents the queen 's name was coupled with the king 's , and if he died the queen continued as sole ruler . But something can also be said on the other side . Glanville ' thinks that , though women were very well treated , the men were the undisputed masters of their households . Both stelae and wall paintings show the womenfolk waiting on the men at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women so much smaller than the men in all the pictures was for the purpose of showing their inferiority . The women 's quarters were separated from the rest of the house and were usually at the back . When the husband was displeased with his wife , he sent her to " the back of the house , " and to be thus dismissed was considered a disgrace . A wise man of the very early period summed up the attitude toward women in his instructions ' to his son : " If you are a man of parts , make a home for yourself and love your wife in the accepted way : fill her belly ; clothe her back ; and she must have oil for her body . Make her happy as long as she lives , for she will do you credit . " This sounds like excellent treatment , but the last line also sounds like excellent policy . Was such benevolence merely enlightened self-interest again ? Perhaps , or perhaps not . At any rate there follows almost immediately the warning not to let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ modern skeptic may say about motives , the fact remains that nearly all the pictures and writings of the early Egyptians reveal a happy family life , with women on a near equality with men . // Polygyny. ? Polygyny was known but was uncommon . Occasionally here was a double marriage in the royal family for the sake of political Rance . Diodorus claimed that a man could take as many wives as he ached , with the exception of priests who were limited to one . But the orginal records seem to bear out Herodotus 's assertion that polygyny very rare . This does not mean that the husband was necessarily confined to the favors of one woman . The harem very early became an accepted part of Egyptian culture . The man who could afford it would ve a number of female household slaves ( both black and white ) who as a matter of course were considered his harem . There was no moral issue involved ; his right to them was taken for granted . But only one woman was the legitimate wife . The Marriage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of marriage when he married his sister Isis . Whatever fornclities came to be essential , the contract was the important feature . he Torus claims that in the marriage contract it was stipulated that the wits should have control over the husband , but later writers do not agree to such an interpretation . The wife 's authority was doubtless considerslcle in the household ; but in other matters , though receiving great conrJeration , she was not superior to her husband . Petrie ' gives the provisions of the earliest known Egyptian marriage contract , dated 590 P.c . Since it is identical with one 40 years later , he assumes that it was so established type , probably of long standing . The young man first Internd the house of his prospective father-in-law to make his " declaI%ticrn of wife . " The father then gave the youth a dowry of 6 ounces of ' liver and 50 measures of corn . The youth took oath that if he left the bride , either from dislike or because he preferred another woman ( " apart in t he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would return the dowry together with a share of all paternal and maternal property for the children she had borne . The dowry amounted to about $100 ( present value ) . This indicates that marriage consisted chiefly of a business tract ; and , as will be seen , there were heavy penalties for breaking it and hereby causing the other party great inconvenience . That the wife 's status was very high in Coptic times is shown by the forms , of a marriage contract of a priest 's son.2 Since God willeth that we should unite one with the other in righteous wedlock after themanner of every free man and every wise woman ; therefore I have eh thee $40 in present value gold as a bridal gift , that thou mayest come and ' rater my home as a free woman . And for my part I will not neglect thee more in as it , were my own body . Neither shall I be able to put thee forth without // a cause having legal ground . But should I wish to put thee forth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . . . Divorce. ? The divorce formulas was , " I have abandoned thee as wife , I am removed from thee , I have no claim on earth upon thee , I have said unto thee , Make for thyself a husband in any place to which thou shalt go . ' Also , the wife was penalized for abandoning her husband . Further provisons of the contract are revealed by the marriage contract of two Jews marrying at Elephantine in 442 B.C. The bride 's father gave to her clothing and toilet goods and to her husband five shekels plus other presents , the value of each being listed . The agreement was that if the husband died without issue from his wife she would have full right to all his property , and conversely . If the wife stood up in the congregation and said , " I divorce my husband , " the price of the divorce would fall upon her , and she would give him five shekels of silver in addition to everything he had given her . She could then go where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without formal divorce ( i.e. , presumably on grounds that did not fully justify him in such action ) , he was to pay her back a sum which Petrie interprets as being about fifteenfold . Adultery was considered a heinous offense . The adulterous woman was sentenced to lose her nose , since that would detract most from her personal charm . The guilty man received 1,000 blows of the bastinado . The greater crime of rape was frequently punished by mutilation.2 Immorality was strongly condemned by virtuous writers , and the wise issued special warning to youths against the wiles of strange women from abroad . But , nonetheless , gross immorality was widespread , especially among the working class , where assaulting strange women was a common crime . Filial and Parental Obligations .  --  Children were expected to have the greatest regard for their parents . It was the duty of the son to maintain his father 's tomb and to make ancestral offerings . The eldest son was called " the support of his mother . " If the son was not prepared to help his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ legal obligations to do so ) , the daughter was obliged by law to support them . This reversal of the common procedure amazed the Greeks , but it was logical in that the property descended through the daughter . However , such obligations probably had to be enforced very seldom , for filial devotion was strong . It was the son 's duty to " cause his father 's name to live , " and presumably his mother 's name also . He saw that their tombs were maintained according to the rank of the family . Frequently a sl atue of a man 's mother would be placed ill his tomb after his death . This // served the double purpose of showing his love for his mother and proving his descent . One father , after reminding his son of the continuous care his mother had given him during childhood , exhorted him , when married and master of his own home , to " cast thine eyes on her who gave thee birth and provided thee with all good things , as did thy mother . Let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hands to God and He hear her prayer . " ' The last line appears to suggest filial piety as a sort of prosperity insurance , but the records hardly bear this out as the chief motive . Sincere affection played the dominant role . Parents were obligated to do their full share toward the welfare of their children . Their authority over their offspring did not extend to the power of life and death , as it did with the Roman father . The exposure of infants was not allowed , and the murder of a child was considered a vile crime . For such a crime the father was not punished by death , as it appeared to the Egyptians inconsistent to take away the life of the one who had given life to the child originally . But the punishment was a gruesome one , intended to induce grief and remorse . The corpse of the child was fastened to the father 's neck in an embrace and left that way for three days and nights under the watchfulness of a public guard.2 Even the rights of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a capital offense was not executed until after the birth of the child . CHAPTER IV EARLY AMERICAN FAMILY LIFE The settlers of a new country take with them many of the customs and traditions of the homeland . But these familiar ways of life , when transplanted to new soil and climate , often change considerably in the new environment . The American colonists , whether of New England , Virginia , or elsewhere , brought over their old-country patterns of courtship , marriage , and home life , but the new conditions of life soon transformed those patterns in various ways . The Family Ideal. ? Most of the New England colonists were of pure English stock , with the exception of the Scotch-Irish in New Hampshire and the Huguenots of Massachusetts and Rhode Island . The Southern colonists also were English , and in between were found the Dutch and Germans of New York and Pennsylvania . The motives that brought such different peoples to a distant and inhospitable shore were varied ; but whether driven by religious or political persecution or drawn by the hope of a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one want in common ? the establishment of homes . The joys and comforts of family life were doubly valued in the lonely wilderness far away from the Old-World marts with their variety of associations and activities . Writing of colonial life in the 1690-1763 period James Truslow Adams ' says : The dominant note in this social life was that of domesticity . In the somewhat romantic atmosphere with which Americans clothe this early period , it is perhaps the peace , simplicity , and unity of family life which contributes the elements of greatest charm . . . . It is noteworthy that although American cultural life was woven of many ethnic strands , all of those which at the end of the seventeenth century were most effective ? English , Dutch , French , and German ? were of races in which the solidarity of the family was strongly ingrained . To this home-making instinct , rooted in the inheritance of the settlers , was added the influence of environment . Under the conditions of a frontier existence the family tended to become greatly strengthened as a social @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ settlers came mostly by families , and a high premium was set on family life from the first . The strict Puritan ideals have often been represented as breeding an intolerance of spirit that . 91 // denied the genuine beauties of family life . But such was not the case . Strictness there was , but also dignity , integrity , and good-fellowship in family as in community life , though complete family comradery was limited to moments of parental relaxation . Young folk established their homes early , for there was scant comfort for bachelors or maids in New England . In some sections , single persons of either sex were forbidden to live alone and could board or lodge only with families that had been approved and licensed by a magistrate . In several colonies , bachelors paid special taxes . All were expected to marry . Perhaps to heap ridicule on unmarried men the town of Eastham , Mass. , issued the following order ' in 1695 : " Every unmarried man in the township shall kill six blackbirds or three crows while he remains single ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be married until he obey this order . " As the settlers pushed farther west the frontier life favored early marriage more than ever . Without the companionship of a wife in his lonely cabin and deprived of her own sturdy help as well as that of the sons she might bear him , the bachelor 's outlook was a rigorous one . The unmarried woman 's lot was still less enviable , for frequently she was little better than a servant in the home of her parents or relatives , with little individuality allowed her . There was no career open to her but marriage , and this was usually entered into early and not always for love . One could not afford to pass up many opportunities to escape the dread of spinsterhood . Cheap land , simple living , and the necessities of life for all who were willing to work left no incentive for postponing marriage . In the Southern states , at least , it was rather common for girls of thirteen and fourteen to marry , and one writer reports that in North Carolina grandmothers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grandmothers at forty were common , mother and daughter frequently having infants at the same time . Various writers agree that most of the girls were married before they were twenty , and most of the young men by the time they were twenty-two . In the Middle West a youth could earn $12 per month as a " hand , " and with $100 saved up he felt ready to marry . A century ago good uncleared land could be purchased for little more than $1 an acre . Families were large , one writer saying that when a pioneer couple established a home they were surrounded in an incredibly short tine with a flock of urchins who seemed to spring up like mushrooms . Benjamin Franklin called attention to the rapid rate of increase and I he ease with which parents could provide for their children . Poor parents could easily apprentice their children until the age of twenty-one , at . a // profit large enough to enable them to purchase enough land to keep the rest of the family . Adam Smith pointed out that , whereas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ class with four or five children would have little prospect of marriage , in America such a widow would 1N. considered a regular fortune . Families of a dozen or more children were extremely common , and it is no wonder that a woman 's beauty faded rapidly after marriage and she was old by middle life . Hard toil and incessant childbearing took heavy toll . Courtship and Marriage. ? The hardness of life in the new country cessitated that all members of the family work , and it was impossible to rep the women and girls as secluded as older customs might dictate . efforts were made to preserve the more staid rules of courtship , but these steadily gave way before the new conditions which forced some changes and invited others . Young folk mingled quite freely at social gatherings and dances , and the young men were permitted to accompany the girls home afterward without the elders ' chaperonage . In fact young people were trusted on long journeys together . The journal of two Quaker maidens relates in a matter-of-fact way their horseback trip through Virginia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Boston young couples could walk upon the town green in the evening , but t he nine-o'clock curfew was their signal to go home . The diary of Judge Sewall , ' of Massachusetts , revealed some of the urting customs of the day . His daughter Mary was " set up in marage " without much difficulty , after her suitor had courted her in her borne nearly every night for some months ; but another daughter , Betty , caused him much anxiety by refusing suitors acceptable to her father . Ititit she was finally married to a previously rejected suitor . This was in 1700 , and the fact that Cotton Mather performed the ceremony shows that the earlier insistence on civil rather than ecclesiastical marriage us breaking down . Young folk " sparked " with enthusiasm , though sometimes the terest was a little one-sided when the suitor was considerably older an the maid . One Sarah Eve , ' of Philadelphia , wrote in her diary 1772 : In the morning Dr. Shippen came to see us . What a pity it is that the Doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more agreeable if he were less d . One hates to be always kissed , especially as it is attended with so many // inconveniences . It decomposes the economy of one 's handkerchief , it disorders one 's high roll , and it ruffles the serenity of one 's countenance . The rough-and-ready life of the country encouraged departure from the most established patterns , and the bolder youths frequently disregarded the rules almost altogether . A determined man in search of a bride might approach a young woman previously unknown to him , propose , be accepted , and arrange for the banns to be published , all within the same day . Kidnaping of a bride-to-be by a former lover was not unknown . The family was patriarchal in form , but paternal authority was not always exercised to the full . Daughters were allowed to refuse their suitors , although in certain instances the father might assert some pressure when a particularly promising suitor hove in sight . But if the paternal insistence was too strong , the girl could appeal to a magistrate . If unreasonable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to result in fornication , the young folk were not alone in bearing the severe social disapproval ; the opposing parents were charged with their share of the blame . Bundling. ? One method of courtship that was encouraged by frontier conditions was that of bundling . Many of the poorer families lived in one-room cabins , which made it necessary for young folk to do their courting in the presence of others . It required too much fuel to keep the fire going far into the night , and too many precious candles . Furthermore , it was too cold to sit up without a fire . The young lovers were therefore allowed to go to bed , partly or fully dressed , and continue their whisperings under the protecting covers . Frequently , the parents and the other members of the family were asleep in the same room . The common attitude toward bundling is shown by the reply of one man when asked whether he was n't ashamed of it : " Why , no ! What is the use of sitting up all night and burning out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get under kiver and keep warm ? " This peculiar custom was fairly prevalent in New York , Pennsylvania , and some of the New England colonies before the Revolution . It seems to have been most common in Connecticut ; indeed Diedrich Knickerbocker attributes its introduction among the Dutch lasses of New Netherlands to " pleasant-tongued varlets " from Connecticut who were more attractive to the simple lasses than were their " ponderous Dutch gallants . " However , Stiles ' resents this attempt to make the English wholly responsible for a custom that was doubtless brought over to this country by both Dutch and English . Among the poorer agricultural classes of Scotland a similar custom was prevalent , and the Queecsling custom // of the young mynheers and jufvrouwen in Holland was transplanted to America . Washington Irving ' describes this " curious device among these sturdy barbarians " ( the Connecticut colonists ) as an evidence f Yankee shrewdness in being unwilling to " buy a pig in a poke . " He as sure that it was not so innocent a pleasure as its defenders claimed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , therefore , do I chiefly attribute the unparalleled crease of the . . . Yankee tribe ; for it is a certain fact , well authenticated by urt records and parish registers , that wherever the practice of bundling preled , there was an amazing number of sturdy brats annually born unto the te , without the license of the law , or the benefit of clergy . But this did not prevent them from growing up into hardy whalers , woodcutters , and " strapping corn-fed wenches . " Opinion was sharply divided upon the merits of bundling . Undoubty it was practiced by many young people of high character who took undue advantage of the trust placed in them by their elders . Just surely there were others whose conduct brought bundling into disgrace . Is was particularly true of the young men back from the French and tan wars . Used to the rough manners and low morals of camp life y took advantage of bundling and added to its disrepute . Some cats condemned the custom , but others upheld their daughters in it , revealed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ poems " on bundling t passed about the country . In protest at the attempts to stamp out ( fling , The country girls in clusters swarm , And fly and buzz , like angry bees , And vow they 'll bundle when they please . Some mothers too , will plead their cause , And give their daughters great applause , And tell them , ' t is no sin nor shame , For we , your mothers , did the same . One verse of another 20-verse masterpiece raises the economy defense . Since in a bed a man and maid , May bundle and be chaste , It does no good to burn out wood , It is a needless waste . Even the clergymen were divided on the issue . The Rev. Samuel 's , who was called by his enemies learned but unscrupulous , defended idling stoutly , saying that the people thought nothing of it and that // the piety of the Puritan youths was so great that there was no danger of mischief . Said he : It would be accounted the greatest rudeness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ garter , knee , or leg , yet it is thought but a piece of civility to ask her to bundle ; a custom as old as the first settlement in 1634 . It is certainly innocent , virtuous and prudent , or the Puritans would not have permitted it to prevail among their offspring . . . . Bundling has prevailed 160 years in New England , and , I verily believe , with ten times more chastity than sitting on a sofa . ' He went on to say that bundling took place only in the cold season of the year and that the sofa in summer was more dangerous than the bed in winter . He supported his argument with the statement that , about the year 1756 , Boston , Salem , Newport , and New York , considering bundling rather crude for polite society , tried to abolish it by introducing the sofa to render courtship " more palatable and Turkish " ( as the Reverend put it ) , with the result that far more " natural consequences " occurred than under the older system @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Spanish mode of " forcing young people to prattle only before the lady 's mother the chitchat of artless lovers . " But other ministers opposed bundling . Jonathan Edwards thundered against the practice with all his fiery eloquence . In Dedham , Mass. , the Rev. Jason Haven , convinced that the increase in immorality was largely attributable to " the custom , then prevalent , of females admitting young men to their beds , " preached a powerful sermon against it . This was about 1782 . When the grave and beloved pastor launched out on a " favorite custom " that had always been treated only with " mirth and merriment , " the effect was great . " The females blushed and hung down their heads . The men , too , hung down their heads and now and then looked out from under their fallen eyebrows , to observe how others supported the attack . " But it was evidently effective , for the writer says the custom was largely discontinued and cases of immorality became rare in that town.2 Bundling was encouraged by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn a traveler away at night . A British officer , in a letter3 written in 1777 , tells of his embarrassment in meeting with this " indelicate custom " when he stopped at a small log hut for the night .

" I was much astonished at such a proposal , and offered to sit up all night , when Jonathan immediately replied , " Oh , la ! Mr. Ensign , you wo n't be the first man our Jemima has bundled th , will it , Jemima ? " when little Jemima , who , by the bye , was a very pretty black-eyed girl , of about sixteen or seventeen , archly replied , " No , father , not by tunny , but it will be with the first Britainer . " But the lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to sit up and ponder " how great the test of virtue must be , or ow cold the American constitution , when this unaccountable custom in hospitable repute and perpetual practice . " Some writers state that bundling was confined entirely to the lower hisses , but one or two contend that it penetrated all levels of society . here is little doubt , however , that it was practiced chiefly by the r i r r r filer classes and that it began to decline when larger houses were built and the standard of living rose . Also , the attacks of prominent tell hastened its demise . In 1750 it was still very prevalent but declined the latter part of the century , although surviving in a few places beyond 1800 . In 1804 the New York supreme court ruled , in a seduction that since the girl 's parents permitted her to bundle they had no hl to complain of the consequences which " naturally followed it .

When one died , he promptly shopped around among a number of widows until he found one who would have him and who also had some means of her own . He aimed high at first , seeking the more prosperous widows and offering a fairly high sum in case of his prior death ; but when his wooings ( including gifts of almonds , which were considered great delicacies ) were rejected , he tried out lesser widows , reducing his own financial offers accordingly . That some of these widows were fully able to take care of themselves is revealed by their shrewd questions about the sums he had already settled upon his children and how much he had left .

But the mercenary character of marriage gradually declined , for most people were relatively poor , and as the frontier pushed westward the settlers had little to offer in marriage but brave hearts and willing hands . The frontier was a great leveler and made its own values . Marriage Regulations. ? Strange as it may seem , until one remembers the Old World backgrounds at which they were protesting , the Puritans considered marriage a civil contract instead of a sacrament , and hence civil marriage for a time was the only legal form . A Boston clergyman was haled into court for solemnizing marriages . Later the law was liberalized to permit either ministers or magistrates to perform the marriage ceremony . But ministers sometimes preached sermons on marriage occasions @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sermon ) at the halfway station of betrothal . Cotton Mather mentioned this custom . Also , on the first Sunday after marriage it was common for the bride to have the privilege of choosing a text for the minister . Usually , in New England the banns had to be published three times before marriage , but in New Hampshire two guineas would produce an immediate ceremony for those who were in haste . There were a few runaway marriages , although they were looked upon by most as disgraceful . Irregular marriages sometimes brought heavy fines . But in New London , where a certain couple lived in common-law marriage and steadfastly refused to have their marriage regularized , a magistrate eased the scandal by the following conversation ' with the rouble ? ? N lien he net , them on the street : // " John Rogers , do you persist in calling this woman , a servant , so much younger than yourself , your wife ? " " Yes , I do , " retorted John . " And do you , Mary , wish such @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Indeed I do , " she said . " Then , by the laws of God and this commonwealth , " was the disconcerting reply , " I , as a magistrate , pronounce you man and wife . " Husbands and wives could not live apart , for it was looked upon as an ront to family life . A Connecticut court , in 1660 , even ordered that o person having a spouse , in " forraigne parts " could remain more than o years without paying a fine of 40 shillings per month or more than three years without special permission of the general court . This as rather hard on those who had left their wives in the old country until they became better established and on those who could not persuade rein wives to come over to such a wild country .

But the court usually let the young couple . Even children sent over from almshouses in Holland to be bound t had no trouble in making satisfactory marriages when they reached e proper age . I n Pennsylvania the Quakers predominated , although there were also means , Scots , and others . The Quakers were a hard-working , thrifty people , quiet and peace-loving . Their family life was genial but strict discipline . Their own mutual-contract marriage ceremony was accepted as legal , although some of the young folk , impatient with the lay involved in Quaker procedure , would go to a magistrate or minister r marriage , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ couple disciplinary action by the Quaker meeting . The Church of England early got control of the marriage ceremony Virginia , and for a hundred years no magistrate or Nonconformist clergyman could solemnize marriage . But in 1780 and 1784 the regulations were relaxed to permit any ordained minister , under certain conditions , to perform the ceremony . Even certain " sober and discreet clergymen " were given the authority so to act when no clergymen were vaiable . ' Other Southern colonies had similar experiences , with the // exception of Maryland . There , after the tolerant early period , strife became so bitter that in 1777 a law was enacted ? and later adopted in the present code ? forbidding any marriage by a civil magistrate . In some sections the infrequent visits of either ministers or magistrates made it difficult to marry and resulted in extralegal cohabitation until a person with authority to marry came that way .

But they reminded him that he had more authority than anyone else in that district , and after the eggnog had circulated freely he stood the young couple up in front of him and in stentorian tones performed the ceremony in these words : " I , Captain Shaumberg , of the 2d regiment of the United States army , and commandant of Fort Stoddart , do hereby pronounce you man and wife . Go home ! behave yourselves ? multiply and replenish the Tensaw country .

New conditions create new standards . The rigid laws of older settlements are sometimes replaced on the frontier by common sense , and judgments are made to fit the peculiar circumstances . Theodore Roosevelt , in his " Winning of the West , " describes the problem created by the unexpected return of a man long since captured by the Indians and given up as dead . If the man 's wife meanwhile had married again , she was given her choice between the two men , the other being obligated to leave the community . Usually she chose her first husband , but in either case the legal irregularity seemed to disturb no one . Sex Standards. ? Every country , new or old , has its share of sex immorality , and early America was no exception ; whether it had more than its share is difficult to say . In 1642 Governor Bradford complained of the incontinence of both married and unmarried persons in Plymouth .
