The Lords &; Commons : <P> Adjourned until Oct. 29 . Since the Prime Minister and Mrs. Baldwin will vacation in France , taking the waters of Aix-les-Bains as usual , Mr. Baldwin seemed to have decided last week against a general election in this Jubilee Year , was expected to go to the country next <P> Spring , though not compelled by statute to do so until the Autumn of 1936 . <P> The Lords : <P> Received the King 's assent in traditional Norman French " Le Roy le veult ! " ( " The King so wills ! " ) to the bill giving India a new federal form and Constitution , this act being the longest ever passed by Parliament ( TIME , Dec. 3 et seq . ) . <P> During hot debate in both Houses , such foes of the act as Winston Churchill charged that His Majesty 's Government put " disgraceful pressure " upon India 's princes , " amounting to blackmail in some cases , " to force their agreement .
