txt " Canadian Pacific Railway will report an increase in nct after taxes for September of more than 51.000.000 as compared with the $3.030,620 shown in September , 1929. according to present estimates . " said E. W. Beatty , chairman of the board and president Discussing the Canadian Pacific 's outlook for traffic and earnings for the balance of the year , Mr. Beatty said : " At the beginning of November . 1929 , the western grain traffic movement came almost to a standstill General bustnes , however , was fairly well sustained . This year general business operations are at a somewhat ke.ver level . On the other hand , grain has been moving much mo : e freely since the beginning of the current crop year . and it is reasonable to hope that the movement between now and the end of the year may be somewhat heavier than in the same period of 1929 . Vl'eather Unfavorable for Threshing " ' Weather conditions in certain sections of the west during the last two or three weeks have been unfavorable for threshing . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ areas affected are able to complete the threshing of their wheat , it will be necessary to move the grain from these areas promptly to terminal elevators , whet e these are facilities for drying and treatment . " Coal and coke loadings have shown increases in the last two weeks , and the movement of these commodities should continue to show gains as stocks in dealers ' hands are reported to be smaller than a year ago . Other constructive factors are the increased operations reported by certain manufacturing plants following the recent tariff adjustments and the traffic which will be stimulated by the special works to be undertaken by the Dominion , Provincial and Municipal authorities and the railways to relieve unemployment . " As our maintenance program for the year was well advanced during the early months of the summer , the substantial economies in all branches of our operations , which became apparent in our August returns , may be expected to continue . 8,000,000 Fewer Bushels of Wheat in Storage " There are about 8,000,000 fewer bushels of wheat in storage at interior and country elevators @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time last year . That is largely due to weather conditions . It is estimated that 29 , - 000,000 more bushels of wheat still remain to be marketed over our lines than a year ago . " On the basis of Mr. Beatty 's estimates , Canadian Pacific Railway will report net after taxes for September of more than $6,000,000 , compared with $5,010,620 reported for September , last year . Preliminary gross revenues for the month already have been reported , totaling $18,629,000. a decrease of $357,000 from the $18 , - 986,000 for September , 1929 .
