Fhrer Hitler took Memel last week with enough flourish to make it seem valuable . It is not . The district is a homespun , colorless countryside 1,099 square miles in area bounded by East Prussia , the Baltic Sea and Lithuania . The population is a piddling 152,000 , some 78% of them claimed by Germany . Memel has no industries important enough for the Nazis to boast of and Germany has many better ports . To Lithuania , however , it represents one-sixth of her industry , and it was the nation 's only good outlet to the sea . With Memel gone , Lithuania now has only twelve miles of coastline . Furthermore , the Memel area controls the mouth of the Niemen River , on which traffic winds far into Poland . <P> In taking Memel , Fhrer Hitler reaffirmed the old principle ( temporarily forgotten in Czecho-Slovakia ) of bringing back all the German " children " into the Reich 's fold . Once decided on , the occupation of Memel was carried out with the Fhrer 's usual one-two-three precision . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Juozas Urbsys an ultimatum ( in Berlin , as always ) , accompanied with the usual threats of invasion . Before long Foreign Minister Urbsys delivered Lithuania 's acquiescence , agreed to sign a non-agression treaty which makes Lithuania a buffer State between the Reich and Poland and the Baltic nations . <P> What distinguished the actual occupation was that the Fhrer personally " struck " from the sea . As if playing at naval conquest , he traveled to Memel on the pocket battleship Deutschland , followed by 60 other fighting vessels including two battleships , three cruisers , two destroyer flotillas , three torpedo-boat flotillas , numerous small craft . In the face of this attack the Lithuanian Navy , consisting of one 22-year-old , 500-ton patrol ship ( a rebuilt German minesweeper ) , which mounts two three-inch guns and three machine guns , puffed out to sea for destination unknown , as homeless as the Flying Dutchman . Herr Hitler had won his first naval battle . The victory was consolidated when a naval corps-1,080 marines-landed and officially occupied the area . <P> Adolf Hitler spent scarcely @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time to deliver a speech in which he said : " What we can expect from the other world we know . We do not have the intention to inflict suffering on this other world ; however , the sufferings that it inflicted on us we had to make good again and I believe that in essentials we have already arrived at the conclusion of this unique restitution . " <P> The " other world " knows by now not to take Herr Hitler 's speeches of satiety seriously , but for those who believed that he would have to take a nap after swallowing both Czecho-Slovakia and Memel , there came a significant revision in the official text of the speech handed out to the press . In the revised version the above passage ended considerably more abruptly : " But the suffering that it inflicted on us must come to an end . "
