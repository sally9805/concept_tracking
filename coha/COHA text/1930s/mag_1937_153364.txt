God 's Country and the Woman <P> ( Warner Bros . ) . Instead of Arabia or Becky Sharp , Producer Hal Wallis chose the more realistic subject of the Northwest woods and the logging industry for this Technicolor . Cast , technical crew , Director William Keighley and Red Spierling , logging superintendent of the Crown Willamette Paper Co. , whose crew set a world 's record in 1931 by getting out 1,662,000 ft. of lumber in a single day , spent two months at Longview , Wash. , making the outdoor sequences . The result , as background of a story loosely adapted from James Oliver Curwood 's 1922 novel , is the most spectacular investigation of the lumber industry so far contributed by the screen . It is also in many respects the most effective , because least exotic , contribution to the screen so far made in Technicolor . <P> Recalled from a playboy career in Europe by his brother who heads the family lumber company , Steve Russett ( George Brent ) lands a plane on a lake in timber that belongs to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Beverly Roberts ) turns out to be a spitfire blonde , Steve stays on as a lumberjack , works up to foreman before Jo finds out who he is . By the time she fires him as a spy , they are in love . This complicates his brother 's scheme to force Jo to sell him her land by engineering a jam of Barton logs that her men can reach only by trespassing on Russett property . Steve , who has already expressed his devotion to Jo by fighting with a disloyal lumberjack ( Barton MacLane ) , winning the esteem of her foreman ( Alan Hale ) , and driving a supply train through a Russett barricade , finally makes her believe in it by dynamiting the jam while the personnel of both lumber camps enjoy a free-for-all fight on the river bank . Good shots : An expert logger nonchalantly retrieving a water bottle from the notch in a fir tree , just as the notch closes when the tree falls ; the timber country color photographed from the air , with fir-covered mountains spread out to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ <P> Camille ( Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer ) . For this version of Alexandre Dumas ' famed tearjerker , Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer assembled the three best current writers of tearjerkers , the top director of tearjerkers , the screen 's No. i tragedienne and the industry 's current male box-office sensation . The result , against the lush background of Art Director Cedric Gibbons ' notion of 19th Century Paris , equipped with generous measures of sorrow , pictorial beauty , charm , plot , glamour and audience appeal , amounts to a Camillennium . <P> Marguerite Gautier ( Greta Garbo ) , Parisian demimondaine , breaks with her protector ( Henry Daniell ) when she falls in love with young Armand Duval ( Robert Taylor ) , breaks with Duval when his father tells her she is spoiling his career , finally dies of consumption complicated by a broken heart . For modern audiences this story lacks one element : surprise . Its situations , from the one in which Armand first shows his love for Marguerite by returning to her a handkerchief which he has kept in his pocket ever since the day six @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the one in which , dying , she struggles to her dressing table to rouge her pale cheeks when he comes to visit her for the last time , have become a master pattern for generations of romantic tragedies .
