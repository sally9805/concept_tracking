Why be a mug and stick in a game where the best you can get is the worst of it ? ( He pushes him playfully ) Why be a sap ? &nbsp; LOUIE ( repeating the playful gesture ) Why be a reformer ? ( There is a pause while the two men look menacingly at each other . Then Louie smiles and his voice takes on a purring tone ) Pat , why do n't you get smart ? &nbsp; O'GRADYHow can anybody else be smart when you 've got all the brains ? &nbsp; LOUIEThanks.  --  You 've been doing some thinking for me , now let me do a little for you . ( Deliberately as he takes some brand new thousand dollar bills and arranges them fan-wise in his hand ) If you would clean out Rocco 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be too tough on your friends  --  &nbsp; O'GRADYYeah ? &nbsp; LOUIEI could give you enough of these things to paper a nursery . &nbsp; O'GRADYFunny.  --  Rocco made me that same proposition about you only day before yesterday . &nbsp; LOUIE ( his eyes narrowing significantly ) He did ?  --  I 'm glad to know that .  --  12  --  &nbsp; O'GRADYForget it . &nbsp; LOUIE ( a menace still in his voice ) Forget it ? I do n't forget so easy . ( then with a hard smile ) Say , I even remember the doctor that slapped me when I was born .

Let me take a peek at the numbers on those bills . &nbsp; LOUIE ( angrily backing away ) What 's the idea ? &nbsp; O'GRADYI 'd like to check up that poke of yours with some stuff that was lifted from the mails a few days ago . &nbsp; LOUIE ( with a snarl ) Listen to me , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know it ! I 'm in a legitimate business , I am ! &nbsp; O'GRADY ( now takes Louie 's tone but with a note of sarcasm ) Sure you are . You just peddle a little booze , the poor workin ' man 's friend . You just sell joy to the workin ' classes with a few murders for their entertainment on the side . &nbsp; LOUIEWhat are you tryin ' to do , get my goat so I 'll spill something ? &nbsp; O'GRADY ( quickly ) What have you got to spill ? &nbsp; LOUIE ( instantly quiet again ) You 'll get a chance to road that when I write the history of my life at threefifty a copy .  --  13  --  &nbsp; O'GRADYDo n't write the last chapter until the night before you go to the chair . It will sound more realistic . &nbsp; LOUIE ( calmly lighting a cigarette with the butt of another ) So you think the chair will be the blow-off for me ? &nbsp; O'GRADYIt 's a cinch . How do you think you 'll like the hot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , baby , if I can have you sittin ' on my lap .

This department has made up its mind to nail you , and I 'm the head of the department . Get that ? &nbsp; LOUIENot altogether . I 'm a little bit thick today . Maybe it 's the weather . &nbsp; O'GRADYThe newspapers are riding us . They started something with you that I 'm going to finish ! &nbsp; LOUIEWhen am I going to see you again , Pat ? &nbsp; O'GRADYWhenever anything happens that 's important to this department .  --  14  --  &nbsp; LOUIEThen I 'll be seeing you around the next time some old woman falls down and breaks her leg . ( He exits .  --  O'Grady stands looking at the door , deep in thought .  --  Cassidy enters ) &nbsp; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I thought I 'd come in to ask yuh if you want me to keep after Louie Ricardo . &nbsp; O'GRADYThat was Louie that passed you in the hall . &nbsp; CASSIDYWell , do you know , I had a sneakin ' hunch all the time that that was him ? &nbsp; O'GRADY ( looks at Cassidy and sadly shakes his head ) The Return of Sherlock Holmes .

I guess I was thinking about somebody in Japan . ( He moves to the next character ) And here 's Big Shot Kelley , ' way out in front in the beer racket . I knew him when he was dippin ' old ladies ' pocketbooks.  --  It only goes to show , boys , what perserverence will do .

This is only our first meeting . &nbsp; BIG SHOTI do n't see why we should give you a dime . &nbsp; NIGGERThat 's my idea exactly . ( All the gangsters start talking at once , some agreeing , some protesting , others threatening . ) &nbsp; LOUIEWait a minute ! Let me finish talking and then you can shoot off your faces as much as you like .  --  25  --  &nbsp; MIDGETLet me ask one question  --  If we pay you this money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if some mug crashes another guy 's territory and hijacks the works same as was done with me last week . &nbsp; LOUIEWhat we always do with rats ? &nbsp; MIDGETAre you takin ' care of that too ? &nbsp; LOUIEI 'm puttin ' the beer racket on a big business basis and that covers everythig . &nbsp; ROCCOWith yourself as its big boss , I suppose ? &nbsp; LOUIE ( with a threat in his voice ) I think you heard me the first time . &nbsp; ROCCOSure I did , and I 'm still laughing . &nbsp; BIG SHOT ( sneeringly ) This ai n't a business meeting , it 's a shake down . &nbsp; LOUIEIs that your idea ? &nbsp; BIG SHOTIt ai n't even as good as a shakedown . It 's just a new twist on the old fashioned badger game . ( Some of the others laugh jeeringly  --  Louie struggles to control himself .  --  Mileaway watches him anxiously . ) &nbsp; LOUIEI 'm trying to make you fellows see what 's good for yourselves . &nbsp; NIGGERI ai n't payin ' a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ BIG SHOTThat 's me all over .

( The other gangsters lean forward , eagerly expectant.  --  Big Shot , still sneering , removes the cigarette from his mouth with an air of great deliberation .  --  The smile slowly leaves Louie 's face , and then with a lightning movement he slaps Big Shot with his open hand .  --  There is a general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Big Shot makes a quick movement for his gun .  --  Louie looks at him with a smile and without flinching )  --  27  --  &nbsp; BIG SHOT ( is the first to break his gaze . His feet and his eyes shift uneasily . His voice is the half-whimper of the defeated coward ) What 's the use of gettin ' sore and all heated up about nothin ' . I 'm willin ' to do what the other boys think is right . ( A slight sneer plays over Louie 's lips . ) &nbsp; LOUIEThat 's great . &nbsp; MIDGET ( eager to avoid trouble ) Sure .  --  Sure .  --  Louie 's got a great idea . That 's what we all think , ai n't it , boys ? ( Louie looks intently at the faces about him .  --  The others mumble , " Sure "  --  " Yeah "  --  " I 'm willin ' if the others are " etc . ) &nbsp; ROCCO ( Gets slowly to his feet with a deadly menace in every word and movement ) You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! ( Again Nigger Mike 's hand goes slowly to his left arm-pit ) &nbsp; LOUIE ( turns deliberately on Rocco ) I did n't get that last crack . &nbsp; ROCCO ( bringing his face close to Louie 's ) No ? &nbsp; LOUIEDo you mind letting me have it again ? &nbsp; ROCCO ( sarcastically ) I 'll put it in writing if you say so . ( Louie looks down and notices that Nigger who is standing behind Rocco , has his gun drawn and levelled behind his hat , both of which he is holding in the one hand . The gun is thus out of view of the others )  --  28  --  &nbsp; LOUIEI would n't think of putting you to all that trouble . &nbsp; ROCCO ( With his face close to Louies ) Get this ! I run my own business , hear ? I do n't need no punk like you to tell me nothin ' ! Why ? Because I 'm just as big as you are and bigger . When one man will run this town , I 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that I 'm right . Tell ' em . . . tell ' em . Louie is in a spot and realizes it . He slowly reaches for his hip pocket and slowly draws his handkerchief . He wipes his forehead : &nbsp; LOUIEPhew ! It 's warm in here . ( He turns to Mileaway ) Open that window , will you , Mileaway ? ( Mileaway raises the window at the back of the room . This window is a blind . Behind it is a machine gun . The face of a gangster can be seen peering along the barrel . Rocco and the others stare at the window expressing varying fears . Louie turns to Rocco ) Well , how do you like it , sucker ? I ought to give you some of that heat just for luck . ( He pushes past Rocco and snatches the hat and gun from Nigger 's hand .
