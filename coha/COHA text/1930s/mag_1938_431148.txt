Recent correspondence has made me suspect that the most troubled young lady in this troubled world is the one who has no dates . She writes me from big cities and little towns all over the country , with panic dripping from her pen . " I am seventeen years old , " she says , " and I have no dates ! " " The other girls in my class all have boy friends , and I do n't . " " I ca n't find out what other girls have that I lack , but they get all the dates . " " Boys do n't seem to notice me , and I 'm not having any fun at all . " " When I 'm with a boy , I 'm not one bit interesting . I go down like a flat tire , and he does n't date me again . " She 's pretty miserable . She feels that she 's missing all the fun , and that it wo n't be the same if she does have fun later on . What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one in her sad state , a marked woman in a community of belles . If her parents think she 's so young that it does n't matter , she feels that they 're unsympathetic and do n't understand . If they do understand , her position is all the more painful because of a sympathetic audience . In some ways she 's right , and in some ways she 's wrong . To begin with the latter , she 's very far from being a singular case . If one could take a ballot to show how many girls in the teens are popular with boys and how many are not , I do n't doubt that the result would be close to a draw . Many of those who are n't popular seldom talk about it ; they are shy to start with ( which is one of the troubles ) , and lack of popularity makes them still shyer . And others do a good deal of bluffing . I 've known girls who could make incidents from one date sound like six ? and did , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of girls . The truth is that many boys in their middle teens are not yet interested in girls , and not all boys in the latter teens want to give girls all their spare time . And actually , most girls are better off not to have dates before fifteen , and sometimes sixteen . It takes most girls that long to learn about getting on with other peopl-i . And the fact that you think you 're an exception does n't prove that you are one . Many girls have thought that , and as a result have done and said a lot of silly things for which they were sorry later on ( or should have been ) . To take the other side , a girl of sixteen or older is right in thinking that she 's missing fun if she has no dates with boys . We all need to know both sexes . Friendships with boys and men , as well as girls and women , make us well rounded and give us a better understanding of many things . And a great many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Something is wrong when you are in your latter teens and have no dates a all ? unless you live on a desert island-and a girl is right in wanting to do something about it . She can do something about it as g rule , and get results , if she goes about it intelligently . It 's harder for so than for others , but it 's seldom impossible . And the first rule is not to loos upon dates as an End and All . The moment the matter of having date ! becomes the only important thing : A life , every date assumes such exaggerated proportions that no one could be natural about it . The best actress in the world is ill at ease if half her mind i on what she 's saying and the other hall is thinking : " Oh , I hope I 'm saying the right thing . I wonder if my dress is all right . I do hope he likes me ! " Once you get into a dither about the impression you 're making , you 're @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoil your chances of popularity with the very boy you 'd like to interest There is a simple way to avoid that pitfall , but it takes a lot of will power . It 's just a matter of making the boy a side issue while you are concentrating on something else . The trouble is that not all girls  | have that much concentration , and it 's hard for them to see that they need it . It 's particularly hard to apply yourself to the matter in hand if you have chosen to do something that you can do with boys , which is usually the best plan . Something like dancing or tennis or swimming or bridge or entertaining or any one of a hundred other things . The trick lies in really becoming so interested in learning to do that thing just as well as you can possibly do it that you actually and sincerely look upon the boy merely as an aid in helping you to become an expert . Once you have done this ? not halfheartedly , with one eye and two-thirds of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention as though your companion were another girl ? you 'll find your problem fading . This is bound to be true . First , because you will forget about self-consciousness , which blurs anyone 's attractiveness . Second , because the boy will share your interest in the sport and like your proficiency . Third , because he will sense the fact that you are n't angling for him as a beau , which affects the boys most worth knowing like a scratchy collar . In ADDITION to the effect this course will have on current prospects , everyring it teaches you will be an asset later or .. The girl who is good in three sports has three times the chance the girl who is good at only one has , when it comes to cultivating friends at a house party or simmer resort . By the time you 've learned several , you may really feel that the boy u now long to attract is an unimportant incident . And if you 've developed that ouch , you are equipped to interest a more interesting man . Incidentally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find yourself in a ace where no dates are possible , you to n't mind half so much . But it is one c the inconsistencies of life that those who would n't mind are n't the ones to be 1 . s:eless . If they do n't know many boys er men , they are the ones with enterprise tough to join some social organization a church or a " Y , " or a dancing class tennis club or beach club or country club . Once in , they realize that they have ? contribute something in the way of cooperation and that sitting in a corner and feeling neglected wo n't get them far . Ii you find all this hard to believe , look ound at the most popular girls among friends . How many merely sit and de appeal ? Do n't they ride well or ce well or talk so well that you know y have taken the trouble to be in-I ested in a good many subjects and learn cut them ? Or are n't they capable when comes to running a party ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from . sincere interest in them , instead of halfdoing them , with one fluttering eye on a facination young man ? There are a few exceptions , but their appeal is seldom lasting . They flit from e to date right through life , seldom the same partner for very long . As for-he others , you will find that each has specialty or specialties , regardless of dates That 's why the lady is a belle .  |
