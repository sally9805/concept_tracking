txt The English Parish excitement in Holsham parish when Gerald de Noke , the parson , preached one Sunday a special sermon , telling of the doings of the heathen Saracen in the Holy Land , calling upon all the men of Holsham , if themselves they could not go , to give what money they could for the holy work of defeating the Saracen and winning back Palestine for Christendom . From every secret store of coins money poured in to the priest 's coffers for the crusade ; but still the sum that Aubrey needed to equip his forces was not secured . Then came the suggestion that Aubrey adopted gladly . Probably Thomas the reeve was the man responsible for the scheme . At any rate , it was he , as his duty was , who called the villagers together to hear the lord 's suggestion . Very cunningly did Thomas describe the plan . " Which of you , " he cried , " has not grumbled at doing his task-work on my lord 's land ? Now this is what my lord @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day 's work , and thereafter whoever works upon my lord 's land shall receive pay for his labour . " There was a cheer from the listening villagers , for under the peaceful rule of Henry II many of them had gained money ? not much , but a little . Also now that there was a fair-sized town growing up in their neighbourhood , Torrington , once a tiny village like Holsham and grown mightily within the last century , there was more money to be got by selling goods in the town 's market . The thing was agreed , 8o The Decay of the Manor therefore , and each villein received a copy of Holsham Manor roll . Here is a typical entry : John le Villeyn holds half a hide of land a long description follows showing where each strip lies , for which he owes three days ' work in the week , or vi pence , and ten eels each year upon Ash Wednesday to the lord 's table . Evidently John was a fisherman as well as a farmer . Now John le @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and was free to devote every day to his own lands and his fishing . From his point of view it was a fair bargain . But the biggest gainer was the lord of the manor , for now he could hire labourers and work his lands according to the newest principles . Here his adviser was one Roger the monk , who acted as steward of the estate while Aubrey was away in Palestine . He had learned from Latin books various methods of making land more productive . There is no need to describe the complicated system of what modern slang would describe as swops , ' by which all the lord 's land that had lain scattered about the field was gathered into one group , and farmed separately from the rest of the village land . The point is that by taking rent instead of service Aubrey , though he did not know it , had sealed the doom , as far as Holsham was concerned , of the manor system . Nor was this Aubrey 's only service to Holsham . The terrible climate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ killing hardships claimed him as their victim . The little cavalcade with their white cyclases and red crosses , that rode off so gaily for Hythe , there to embark for the Holy Land , never returned . A few worn and weary survivors came back along that road five years later . But the lord of Holsham was not among them . His body lay beneath the sacred walls of the Holy City . Very sorrowful was the Lady Gertrude . Indeed , her sorrow was shared by all the village , for Aubrey had been a good lord to Holsham . But the lady 's sorrow took practical form ; she sent for a lawyer from Canterbury , a solemn black-gowned man who rode out upon a thin steed , and wrote what the Lady Gertrude dictated . Thomas the reeve and Gerald the priest were called to witness her signature , or mark , rather , for she could not write , to a deed that gave certain lands ( the farm that afterward became known as Souls Farm ) for the rebuilding of the church of Holsham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of tiles and a convenient altar whereat for ever prayers should be said upon each day for the soul of Sir Aubrey de Harbron and his wife the Lady Gertrude . For this a suitable clerk should be chosen by the lord of the manor of Holsham for the time being , with the assent of the priest of Holsham parish , to receive two marks 11 6s. 8d. by the year for his trouble . " // , New Ways JET us take a look at the new parish church of Holsham , rising through the bounty of Sir J Aubrey 's widow . The times are troublesome and turbulent . Normandy has gone for ever : it is a French province now , and among the rushes at Runnymede King John sets his seal to the Great Charter . But these things do not trouble the common folk of Holsham much . For none of them either knows or cares much about Normandy . They do not regard it , as the English were later to regard India , as a national possession : they regard it very much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the personal possession of the English King . Nor does the Great Charter worry them over-much . They know that King John is a bad man , because he has got the country put under an interdict , and for the last years the harmless villagers of Holsham have been deprived of the consolations of religion owing to his quarrel with the Pope . On the other hand , they have rather enjoyed the furious denunciations of William de Islip the priest ; they would all at some time or another have liked to say just that sort of thing , but had no words to say it . As for being in favour of the Charter , the people 83 The English Parish of Holsham know nothing whatever about it , and if they did would assuredly disapprove of a great deal of it as giving power to the barons ? there is still an old man living in the village who remembers Stephen 's reign . What interests them is that now the interdict is removed the building of the church goes on apace . It is a wonderful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a cross , and the workmen are busy now laying across the lovely carved beams that are to carry the tiled roof . There are strange men in the village , too ? carvers from Amsterdam , skilled Italian masons and stone-cutters ? who are engaged upon the beautiful carving of the window arches , those heavy , round , decorated arches that are so solemnly in character with the rest of the church . The stone altar , too , of purest marble , is something new in the experience of the untravelled folk of Holsham ; daily they come to stare at the work in progress . The church , like that old half-timber building that Egbert had built , is cross-shaped , but now from the centre of that cross rises a square tower with a highpitched roof . More , the skilled stone masons , with an art unknown to the old English , have been at work upon the doors and windows . The old plain round arches are left unaltered , and where new openings are made they conform to this style . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chisels of the workers , so that the grim outlines are softened by lace-like tracery . It is this that differentiates the church from the squat stone castle that Sir 84 New Ways John Harbron is building on a mound near by to take the place of the old wooden blockhouse . Otherwise the architecture of both is much alike , for the days of the elaborate fortress castle have not yet arrived . But most beautiful of all is the little shrine in a side chapel in memory of the crusading Sir Aubrey . For here , wonder of wonders to the ignorant villagers , sits a man who chisels from a block of grey stone a figure of a knight in armour lying cross-legged upon a raised couch . It is not much like Sir Aubrey , which is not surprising , as the man has never seen him , but the villagers and the crusader 's widow are both willing to take the will for the deed . It is , at any rate , a tangible memorial to a man whom his tenants liked well enough , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rough way , to poorer folk . At last it is done . The church that we now see so old and weathered in Holsham village gleamed new under the glow of an English June . Now that the hand of the Victorian restorer has been obliterated by wise modern rectors the church is not so much changed from that in which the parishioners of Holsham assembled in that year of grace 1225 . The builders had been economical . Where there was sound old Saxon stonework existing they worked it in with their new designs , so that to this day you can find traces of the earliest stone church at Holsham ? probably one of the earliest stone churches in England . It was a day of rejoicing in Holsham , of course a holiday . There was a certain beauty about medieval 85 The English Parish life ; it had none of the hustle that we consider necessary to-day . There were frequent general holidays ? the name means holy days ? upon the festivals of saints , and , besides this , there was nothing to prevent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some extra occasion . Certainly the medieval method of work has one good thing to recommend it . Here is no scamped or hurried work . Every stone is well and truly laid , even if the laying of that one stone has taken almost as much time as is taken to-day in running up a bungalow that shall be an eyesore for miles around . The carving and woodwork are of the finest . The horrible gargoyles that carry off the waterspouts from the roof are truly appalling , and send delightful shivers down the back of every child who looks at them . Imagine a ghost story written by the carver of that frightful head that peers evilly at you from above the porch ! Not the Provost of Eton himself could imagine a worse horror than the simple craftsman who carved that stone . But the ugliness is set off by beauty , as it always should be . Inside the church are none of the horrors that peer over the coping of the roof . Here great columns as thick as trees rise to the broad , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ columns monotonously grey . For the Church scorns no means of teaching that may reach the minds of simple folk who can not read and write . Therefore on walls and columns are painted in a queer , stiff style picture 86 New Ways stories from the Bible and the lives of the saints . Here is St George with his dragon beneath his feet , there St Christopher carrying the infant Christ over the water , and on another column is painted the Agony in the Garden . But look between the trunks of this forest of stone and you shall see the glory of Holsham church , the lovely broidered altar-cloth that is the gift of the widowed Lady Harbron to her church . Purple velvet from the looms of Flanders , bought at great cost from a pedlar at Lewes fair , gold thread and manycoloured silks that have come a weary way ? by caravan across the fierce deserts of the East , thence by galley to Venice of the South , and thence by pack-horse and ship to this cold North land ? all are woven @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ represents our Lord speaking to His Apostles , evidently , from the Latin inscription worked around the picture , on the occasion of the Sermon on the Mount , for the words , translated , run : " Blessed are the pure in heart , for they shall see God . " On one side stands St Peter , holding the golden keys , on the other St John , while from above a bearded , noble face smiles down upon the group , that of the Father Himself . Then on one of the side panels is embroidered a picture of the Virgin in her blue cloak holding her Child close to her heart . On the other panel a group of Roman soldiers , dressed in the costume of the thirteenth century ? but nobody minded that in those days ? are 87 The English Parish seen seizing upon our Lord in the Garden , while an evil-looking man presses a kiss upon his cheek , and St Peter strikes with his sword at the high priest 's ser vant . Purple , gold , and scarlet gleam and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high windows that pierce here and there the thick stone walls of the church . Nor are the priest 's robes less sumptuously embroidered by the skilful fingers of Lady Harbron and her busy sewing women . He stands there before his altar , watching the faces of that congregation , gathered for their first Mass in the new church . Then , after worship , comes rejoicing . Sir John Harbron has presented a whole fat ox to the village ; it roasts and sizzles over a huge bonfire . Coarse fare enough , but what do the villagers , who seldom eat meat at all , care for that . Nor are the villagers feasting alone : near the gathering of common men is set a small table , where are seated Sir John Har bron and his lady . He looks what he is , a great English gentleman , as he sits there in his embroidered tunic set off by the long yellow surcoat that he wears . Opposite him sits his lady , her round , smiling face framed in its wimple , her eyes watching @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how he will like this simple festival after having known the extravagant glories of King John 's Court . Her long rose-red cloak is pulled a little round her shoulders , for the breeze is chilly , and now and then she turns her head , laughing a little to hear the hoarse , happy laughter from the direction of the bonfire. 88 New Ways There is French wine at Sir John 's table , and that leads to a little comedy . For , in the kindness of his heart , Sir John sends for some of the leading villagers to share a horn of wine with him , which they gulp down dutifully , with clumsy bows , returning to their own place by the fire , making wry faces , to wash out the taste of the wine with strong brown ale . " Aye , " grumbles Edward the reeve , a stocky , wizened man clad in a rough frieze gown , his holiday dress , and therefore of a gay crimson hue , " this wine 's well enough for them that like it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ body and warmth in that ! " Then , after all have eaten and drunk , comes the dancing , to the music of Alwin the shepherd 's pipe , a somewhat doleful instrument to which the villagers tread a solemn measure . Gradually , as the folk warm to their work , the dancing becomes faster and merrier , till night falls on a scene of mirth and noisy laughter , that is kept up till the dying glow of the fire warns all sober folk to bed . Not that all the villagers of Holsham are sober , but there is no bestial drunkenness . A few men are merry and talkative , that is all . It is the rejoicing of the parish in their new church , coarse and crude to the ideas of certain moderns , but the whole sense of the village is one of reverent mirth ; the man who profaned the festival by getting horribly drunk would be dealt with by the rest . Of course this spirit depended a good deal upon the character of the parish priest . William de Islip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moral tone 89 The English Parish in his parish ; another sort of priest , and the nature of the festival might have been far other than it was . Now but one thing lacked to bring the new church to perfection , a real musical bell , deep-toned and im pressive . The poor little cracked tinkle of the old church bell seemed very much out of place in this fine new building with its careen roof and tower , but the difficulty was that the money would not suffice to provide an expensive new bell . This was the first faint beginning of the Gild of St Thomas of Canterbury , one of those little forgotten village gilds that did good work in their time , but have been overshadowed by the greater gild-merchant of the town . The thing started in an informal meet ing after Mass upon a Sunday soon after the com pletion of the new church . " That bell , neighbour Alwine , mislikes me ; it has a cracked , weakly tone , " said one . " Aye , " answered Alwine @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bell on my wether that leads the flock , let alone in the house of God . " " ' T is a sin and a shame , " cried Simon the village beeward , a thin little man , lame of one leg , but with the keen , eager mind that often goes with a bent body . " Aye , aye , " answered Gurt the miller ; " but what to do , master Simon , tell me that ? " Gurt was fat and good-natured , but lacking in brains . " Why , are we so feeble a lot that we can do nothing ourselves ? " asked Simon scornfully . There was a murmur of doubtful questioning from go New Ways the rest of the group . Most of the grown men of the parish had clustered round the disputants . " Remember to call upon God 's aid , " rebuked William de Islip . Simon bowed his head . " That we should do , Father , but ' t were best to work as well as pray . " " True @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves have worked as well as prayed . God has no love for idlers and slow bellies . . . . " William de Islip checked himself . It was not well to discuss with laymen the problems that were troubling him : the matter of the monastery , that was to produce in a few years ' time a great body of men who would try to combine work with prayer instead of shutting themselves away from the world . " Then , " cried Simon , " this is my plan . Let as many as will band themselves together , and ask the protection and guidance of Our Lady and of St Thomas of Canterbury ? for they reckon him a mighty saint , and close at hand too . Then let each brother of that gild covenant to pay by the week one halfpenny till we have gathered enough for a new bell . " There were murmurs of assent among the grouped villagers who listened to Simon 's words . But some one ? whom , we can not know ? voiced the thought that was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , Simon , to gather enough for such a bell as shall be fitting for our new church . " " Brethren , " broke in Gurt 's hearty voice , " I know 91 The English Parish one , a merchant of Hythe , a good and charitable man , for did he not take to apprentice my brother 's son , and set him up in his trade , too , so that the boy prospers and grows rich . Perhaps he and others would lend us enough from their store , if we covenanted to repay from the money gathered as Simon proposes . " " That might be well tried , Gurt , " put in the priest softly , " but let us see how many will contribute . " " I , Father . " " And I ! " " And I ! " The words came in a continuous murmur from the assembled villagers . " What of you , Dickon ? " asked Simon of a gloomyfaced man who watched the rest from a position in the rear of the crowd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a miser , and an evil-tempered miser at that . There was a murmur of anger from the rest of the parish . " Let him be , my children , " cried the priest , seeing that it was likely that Dickon would be attacked by the rest , now enthusiasts for Simon 's plan . " God will judge between him and you . " There were other malcontents , but in the main every member of the parish who could afford the subscription enrolled himself a member of the gild . Then , under the leadership of Simon the beeward and the reeve Edward , a little party of villagers set off for Hythe , three days ' journey away , to interview the merchant whom Gurt would introduce to them . He g2 New Ways proved , as Gurt had said , a charitable man , not only willing but eager to help on the work of God , as he would consider the founding of the new church bell . Money they should have , and welcome , on giving reasonable security for repayment over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of a bell-founder who had been working on a new bell at St Paul 's in London , a good workman and honest . He would get him to accept the task of founding a new bell for Holsham Church , and to do it for a reasonable sum too , for he was a good Christian man who would not seek overmuch profit for himself from poor pious men . So the bell is made , and after many weary months of waiting a great wagon comes creaking over the muddy track that leads into Holsham village bearing the new bell upon its groaning timbers . With much labour , for it is heavy and clumsy to handle , the bell is slung to its beam in the tower , and its deep tones ring out an invitation to a Mass of rejoicing and thanksgiving , decreed by the gild to which it owes its being . Master Simon the beeward , for he has been chosen first warden of the gild that he himself suggested , comes to church leading his brethren and sisters ? for a few of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their halfpence for the bell . He is clad for the occasion in a robe of red cloth that Sir John Harbron has presented to the gild to be the warden 's dress . These people of the Middle Ages were very like u-q of to-day : they loved to dress up on great occasions . In the rich town the gildsmen might have fur-bordered 93 The English Parish robes and gilt maces and staves , but here in a little remote country parish some simple mark of position must suffice ? a red cloak , or a carved wand of office . Mass is said , with a special prayer asking God 's blessing on the gild and its labours , and after comes a feast . We are to describe such a feast later on , so for the moment will say no more about it . Honestly and punctually the wardens of the Gild of St Thomas paid over the accumulated subscriptions to the generous merchant of Hythe , till there came a day when no more need be paid , when , in fact , there were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arose as to what was to be done with them . Now in truth nobody wanted to lose the gild . Most of the men of Holsham belonged to it , and enjoyed the occasional modest feasts that celebrated each year the day of their patron saint , that ambitious , clever churchman who , by a strange turn of fate , won saintship largely through his own bad temper and that of Henry H. So , when there was talk of winding up the affairs of the gild , some among the assembly spoke what was in all men 's minds . " Why should the gild be allowed to die out ? " they asked . " Rather let it be made perpetual , and let each brother or sister who paid his proper subscription be allowed the benefit of special Masses for his soul when dead . Then if any money remains over let the warden and two aldermen be allowed to spend it on helping poor , sick , or unfortunate brothers and sisters of the gild. " 94 New Ways So William de Islip was asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that every member of the gild might know what was needed , and to be the gild chaplain , he and his successors as rectors of Holsham . But at his suggestion a few more rules were added . Here are some of the more important ones , so that you may see how the gild tried to help in the lives and happiness of its members : Let any brother or sister who speaks evil of a gild brother pay one penny , or if not let him be put out of the gild . Let any brother or sister who strikes or misuses a gild brother pay twopence , or if not let him be put out of the gild . If any gild brother or sister die within twenty miles of Holsham let the gild bring back his body for burial . And if any gild brother , unless he be sick , refuse to attend the burying of his gild brother let him pay a penny , and if he will not let him be put out of the gild . Remember , of course , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peasant of King Henry III 's reign . So the gild that had been founded to secure a new bell for Holsham Church became a part of the permanent life of the parish , and in learning to manage its affairs the parishioners , though they knew it not , were preparing to manage the affairs of their parish , when the policy of Henry III 's son and his successors took from the lord of the manor the management of his estate , and handed it over , under supervision , to the dwellers on that estate , the parishioners , in fact . // Changing 7 imes THE life of the Church in the days when Holsham was celebrating the completion of its new church was going through a crisis . For this there were several reasons that , as they concern our story of an English parish , must be roughly sketched here . What had happened was this : the Popes of Rome had inherited much of the position of the earlier emperors ; more , they were actual rulers of quite a considerable State , considering @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The result was that a man was chosen as Pope not for his moral excellence , but for his political skill . There was another question , too , that was in the minds of all good Christians : the problem of the monastery . Once , no doubt , the monastery had been absolutely necessary . Men who would live a Christian life , and fill their minds with the lore of religion , must get away from a world occupied in the rough arts of war , or in wringing a living from the stubborn soil . Christian teaching and example were best preserved by communities of men under strict vows . Besides , the great monastery , built in the form of a hollow square showing but narrow slit windows to the outer world , and guarded from that world by 96 Changing Times heavy gates , was a safe refuge that might survive a time of war and desolation wherein every other mark of civilization was destroyed . For was it not guarded also by the terrible curse of the Church , that even heathen men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Christian nobles ? The monas teries had saved English civilization when the Danes raged over the land , and again when Stephen 's men had defied man , but dared not defy God to the extent of destroying His fortresses as they destroyed those of their mortal enemies , and , while they destroyed many a flourishing town , yet spared God 's towns , the monasteries and abbeys of the land . But that necessity for isolation was becoming less as time went on . Moreover , there were too many monasteries that , though great landowners and , on the whole , good and generous landlords , were not visibly doing much for religion . There were other monasteries that were visibly doing a great deal of harm to the cause of religion . Listen for a moment to the conversation of William de Islip with a friend , priest of a neighbour ing village , on this subject . They are discussing a certain scandal that had lately come to light in the neighbouring monastery of Durlington . " I tell you , brother Wilfrid , " cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fair name of the Church . Here are we who sweat and swink to redeem sinners , while they sit at ease praying much , but working not at all , except forsooth to toil in the 97 The English Parish fields , or copy in fair writing this or that book , and sin at their very door crying out to be saved . " " Aye , " agrees Wilfrid ; " and such idleness leads to sin , and scandal upon the fair fame of Christ 's Church . Not that all are alike , " he continues reflectively ; " I have known monasteries and abbeys of pure fame whose brethren do much good . " William de Islip nods . " So have I , brother , " he answers , " but there is need of men who will live in the world and heal the world as a doctor does , not hiding his knowledge in his own heart , but using it for the good of others . How much more should the doctors of Christ spread their healing power among those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that will come , " urges Wilfrid , and the conversation turns to other subjects . Wilfrid was a good prophet . For there was a great stirring in the very heart of Christendom . In Rome itself one who thought as these two simple priests had gained the ear of the Holy Father himself , and even then his followers were upon their way . Thus it happened that one day a man came into Holsham parish , a tall , lean man , clad in grey robes , with sandals on his feet and a bag at his side , asking for charity in the name of Christ . This the good folk of Holsham gave , filling the man 's scrip with food , and giving him to drink what he would have , the thinnest of sour ale , such as the poorest folk in the village drank . The men of Holsham were curious 98 Changing Times about this man , and asked him who he was , and what he did , to which he replied , smiling : " I am of the Poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " With that the strange man made his way to the parsonage to speak with William de Islip , who welcomed him hospitably . Far into the night these two sat talking by the flickering gleam of a rushlight , for William de Islip was eager to hear all that the wanderer could tell him of his master , Francis of Assisi , of whom the priest of Holsham had heard tales , and of the new message that the stranger had been sent to preach . Thus it was that the friars first came to Holsham village , and at first William de Islip and his successors were friends with these new preachers . The friar and the parish priest both disliked the inactive monks and resented foreign interference , for the friars , though foreigners themselves , had their own reasons for supporting those who attacked the King 's foreign favourites . Exactly what foreign interference meant Holsham was to learn on William de Islip 's death . Their new priest they never saw during all the ten years that he was rector of Holsham . It happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holsham Manor , who had the right of appointing the rector of the parish , was but a boy of ten , and Holsham being held directly from the King the right was in the hands of the boy 's guardian , weak , pious Henry III . Holsham 99 The English Parish was a rich living too , thanks to the generosity of successive lords who had added little by little to the parish priest 's lands . Also since the foundation of the chantry for the soul of Aubrey Harbron the living was yet richer , for as a rule the parish priest was appointed chaplain of this chantry . But now all this was changed . Henry III appointed to the living of Holsham an Italian priest , one Ulrico Gonzona , who had done him service at the Pope 's Court . Ulrico appointed a curate , John de Almone , who was also given the chantry . But the rector himself continued to live at Rome , drawing the profits of the living , and taking no care for its well-being . Nor was the curate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ took to brewing to make it up to some sort of decent standard . Every morning , as the conditions of the chantry grant directed , John de Almone would mutter a hurried Mass at the memorial altar for the repose of Sir Aubrey Harbron . Otherwise he might be found tilling his fields or bending over his brewery vat , careless whether his flock lived or died . Further , he misused in a shocking fashion his duty of hearing Confessions , and demanding penance before he gave absolution . He would use to his own advantage facts that he had come to know through Confession , thus breaking his oath as a priest . He would give easy absolution to those who took care to please him , and impose harsh penances upon those who did not . He was greedy of money , drunken , and men whispered that his morals were ' co Changing Times not what they should have been . There were ugly stories told concerning this man , that , against the law of the Church , he was secretly married . Naturally under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holsham parish . Men would confess to a wandering friar what they would not confess to their own evil priest , and would listen to his sermons and accept his penances , while despising the sermons and neglecting the ministrations of John de Almone . Even the village gild would not have John as their chaplain , but persuaded a monk from Durlington to accept the post . John the priest was despised , and sank into a mere drunken sot , whom no man would reverence . Then the Italian rector died , and Henry Harbron , now a man grown , appointed a good and earnest Englishman , Peter de Wolverley , as rector of Holsham . But the damage had been done . Peter found that his flock would rather go to Confession to a wandering friar than to their rector , and that his church remained half empty , while his parishioners walked miles to hear some preaching friar in the neighbourhood . Moreover , the character of the friars was changing . St Francis and his immediate followers had been great and good men , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their followers to live upon the charity of those to whom they were sent . Unfortunately , men less great and good than these first friars remembered the part of Ioz e The English Parish their rule that allowed them to beg , but forgot the rest . They began to claim , too , that they were specially holy , that absolution granted by a friar was more effective than that granted by an ordinary priest . Also , instead of taking what was offered , as their rule commanded , there were bad friars who demanded what they would like best , and threatened spiritual penalties against any who refused them . In vain Peter de Wolverley preached against these wanderers , " wolves in sheeps ' clothing , " as he called them . For the parishioners of Holsham had become used to their ministrations during the evil days of John de Almone , and would not give them up , besides being afraid of these men who claimed such wide spiritual powers . It came at last to an open quarrel . One friar , Martin , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worst sort of friar , for there were still good and honest men in the friars ' ranks , came to Holsham , announcing that he had special licence from the Pope to hear Confessions and preach . Unlike that first visitor , Friar Martin asked no leave from the parish priest . He resorted to a disused barn , to which the villagers flocked , partly out of curiosity , partly from fear . Then Peter de Wolverley rode post-haste to his Bishop , and from him received letters ordering that friar to obey the rule of his order , and refrain from intruding into a parish without leave of the parish priest . To this the friar retorted that the Bishop had IO2 Changing Times no power over his order , and , being himself a monk , could not know the rules proper for a friar to observe . Further , he added , not without rudeness , he , Friar Martin , had not the slightest intention of obeying the Bishop . Whereat the Bishop , in a royal rage , excommunicated the friar , and cited @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the friar appealed to Rome . The case dragged on for weary years before the Papal Curia , to be decided finally in favour of the Bishop , but with this our book has no concern . Such affairs as these made no easier the relations between parish priest and friar , and Chaucer , whose sympathies were on the side of the parish priest , suggests that they were fairly common . But there was another matter to trouble the peace of Peter de Wolverley , and that was the behaviour of John de Almone , who , though no longer curate of Holsham , still held the post of chantry priest . It took two full years to get rid of this idle and drunken rascal , for he had political influence , and politics played far too much part in Church affairs . Men in high position feared to offend the Papal authorities , whose nominee had appointed John to his post . It was hard indeed to persuade the authorities of the Church in England to act , bad as John admittedly was . The priest who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an interesting name , for it marks the increasing intercourse between England 103 The English Parish and Wales that followed the Conquest of Wales by Edward I. How , one wonders , did this man from the Welsh hills come into this distant village . One can imagine him , a little dark , excitable man among his flock of slow-spoken , easy-going peasants . It is during the days of Owen le Walleys that we find the parish definitely growing into something like the local government . Walleys was priest during the latter half of Edward I 's reign and the unhappy days of his son . Let us look at what is happening to Holsham village . There was a man , Rolf the carpenter , who by skill and industry had accumulated quite a little sum of money . Now it so happened that Sir Guy Harbron , he who was made Earl of Berwick for his conduct during the Scotch wars , killed a monk in a chance fray on the Border , and was ordered for penance to go on crusade to the Holy Land . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a certain act of Edward I known as Quia Emmtores , he was able to sell some of his land to raise it . This land Rolf the carpenter bought from the earl . Now Rolf , since he owned feudal land , though it was but a small patch , and held it directly from the King , was a freeman . Nor was he the only one . Walter of Souls Farm , the bailiff , bought a large piece of waste from the earl , thus becoming a freeman too . Gradually the old rigid distinction between the feudal soldier , generally of Norman descent , who was free , and the agricultural labourer , generally an I04 Changing Times Englishman , who was a serf , was beginning to break down . The informal parish meetings that have so long been a feature of the life of Holsham begin to be more impressive now that they are not mere gatherings of villeins . Also the position of the lord of the manor , now that he has freemen as well as copyholders ? that is , serfs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? upon his manor is more difficult . Lastly there is a series of laws of Edward I regarding the keeping clear of the highways , and the duty of constables , for which the lords of the manor are not primarily responsible . A new officer is appointed , the keeper of the peace , whose duty it is to see that this work is properly done by each manor or parish through which the high-roads run . They must keep the roads in fit condition for travellers , and see that there is a space cleared on each side of the way , so that robbers and murderers can not hide close by the roadside . This must be done by the inhabitants of each manor dividing up the work between them . But where , as in Holsham , the manor and the parish cover the same area it is more convenient for the inhabitants to arrange matters when they meet together after Mass . Then one man can be asked to lend his wagon for a certain day , while another can arrange to cut down a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to make a hard surface for the road over some extra deep 105 The English Parish slough . Then when the court of the manor meets these informal arrangements can be reported to the lord or his bailiff , who in turn will report to the keeper of the peace , who will report to the King 's justices when they come round on assize . Thus there are now two authorities in the manor and parish , though manor and parish may be , and usually are , but two names for the same group . There is the manor court or court leet , there is the parish vestry , or what afterward becomes the parish vestry . But as the policy of successive kings is to reduce the power of the manor lord , naturally the vestry becomes more important , the manor court less important as time goes on . So through the troubled days of Edward II Holsham parish lives its own life , taking little or no part in the quarrel between the King and his barons , caring more for the little things of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elsewhere , till , with the reign of Edward III , comes that which changes the face of rural England . io6 CHAPTER IX The Upheaval THE Middle Ages were closing . The glory of chivalry was dim , a tradition that lingered in the tilt-yard and tournament , but had vanished from everyday life . There were still knights of the old order of chivalry , but they were oldfashioned , fantastic , out of date . The newer sort of man was well represented by that Michael de la Pole who became Earl of Suffolk under the third Edward , a hard-headed , practical Hull merchant whose wealth brought him into the ranks of the nobility . Listen to the tale of the fall of feudal chivalry , as the folk of Holsham parish heard it gathered one evening outside the ale-house . The speaker is a brown-faced man , whose straight figure stands out among the forms of the rustics bent by much stooping over spade and hoe . The blue eyes look almost insolently from a seamed , tanned face , across which runs a scar . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning to become common in England ) , a poacher who saved his skin by enlisting with Edward of England as an archer . " Aye , aye , friends , they came at us , did the French , all riding on their great horses , clad in 107 The English Parish armour that you 'd think a thunderbolt could n't pierce . But we let fly at ' em , and they found that our arrows could beat their armour ; aye , they tumbled over like spillikins , and where they tumbled they lay , for , see you , they had so much armour on their backs that not one could get up when once he fell , even though there might be no wound on him . " The other rustics draw themselves up a little and smile . Here is one of their own sort , a common man whom they have known from boyhood , and he has seen the great nobles of France , armoured knights , like him up at the manor , Sir Oliver Harbron , so fine and fearless , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ men like these fall helpless before a few bowmen of common English clay . Truly the end of the Middle Ages , of romance and armoured knights , of lord and knight and villein , is come . But there are many things to suffer yet . For even as that old soldier of Crecy field boasts and chatters at the inn door death is sweeping over Europe , death more certain and more horrible than ever that archer inflicted with his terrible cloth-yard arrows . God 's archer has bent his bow , and his target is England , that land of loveliness and of foulness , of sweet green spaces and narrow , stinking alleys , of fair-flowered hills and of putrefying middens piled outside men 's back-doors . First come terrible stories , stories that nobody who has not seen this awful disease , as it still destroys Io8 The Upheaval in the crowded , insanitary lanes of Eastern towns and villages , can well credit . Men tell of whole villages where there were but two sorts of people left , the dead and the dying , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the open fields for safety ; stories of mothers who would leave their children dying by the wayside and flee from the horror of death , only to fall a few miles farther on in the same state as their infants ; stories of children driving their dying parents out into the cold and rain , so horrible was the fear of the Black Death . Worse stories than these too are told , but told in whispers . Man , it was said , had eaten his fellowman , driven by sheer , appalling hunger to this dreadful deed , for not only was there plague upon the land , but the plague had brought famine in its train . One can imagine the crowds of trembling men and women who thronged to Holsham Church to pray that the pestilence might pass them by . But of that there was no hope . The terrible thing came creeping over the face of England like some foul blight upon a rose , leaving in place of the fair sweetness that it had devoured a black and stinking mass of corruption . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the records of Holsham parish have to tell of this terrible time . Imagine it if you can . Walter of Staines , he who was rector when the pestilence struck the village , was dead the month afterward. 109 The English Parish He had done his duty as a priest should , going from house to house to comfort the sick , housel the dying , and , from such slender means as he had in stock , feed the starving . Then came John Carpenter , a good man and true . But he too fell to the terrible plague , and his successor , Gilbert-a-Grey , was a man of different mould . A cautious , worldly cleric , he ended his days as a bishop . Gilbert left his new parish to look after itself . London , where Sir Oliver Harbron remained in attendance at King Edward 's Court , was good enough for him . So , without the lord of the manor or the parish priest , the folk of Holsham village must do the best they could for themselves . What they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , that Will Johnson who had been at Crecy and Thomas Hobbs the miller , and bade these two collect from those who could afford to give money and food to help the sick and starving . Also they were to arrange for the burial of the dead somewhere outside the village , for burial in the churchyard might lead to further infection . That may explain the name " Deadman 's Farm " not far off the modern village of Holsham , and also the fact that the villagers to this day will not work a certain low-lying marshy field upon that farm . Superstition , the modern owner calls it . I wonder ! Perhaps there are traditions as to what would be found under that sodden turf , and not so far under it either . IIO The Upheaval As for the spiritual needs of the parish , there came into Holsham a wandering friar , one of the priests among that brotherhood who rose to the occasion offered by the Black Death , holding life cheap compared with duty . Brother Joseph too had been a doctor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his living . The sick , therefore , were sure of such attention as the medical skill of the day could give , and of the Sacrament at the last . As for Gilbert , he troubled his parish not at all . At last the plague was stayed , but after the plague came new troubles to distract the wretched folk of Holsham . For Gilbert-a-Grey came riding into Holsham , as it chanced , at the very moment when Friar Joseph was celebrating a Mass of thanksgiving before the altar . Into the church strode the new parson , more than half drunk , for he had stopped at inns upon his way , and walked up to the intruding friar . The folk of Holsham held their breath . What was to happen next ? Then as one man the parishioners of Holsham ran toward the altar . For this newcomer ? who he was they suspected , but did not know ? had deliberately struck Friar Joseph in the face as he turned to say the prayer of consecration . It was sacrilege , open sacrilege @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of God would descend on this impious wretch . For the moment , however , evil triumphed . Friar Joseph must go on his wanderings again , his wallet III The English Parish crammed with such little gifts as the folk of Holsham could persuade him to accept , while parson Gilbert settled down in his parsonage , and began to harry the miserable parishioners , already at their last gasp , for his tithes and other dues . Moreover , such tithes as he got he wasted in rich living . The state of the church was a scandal . Naturally in the troubles of the past years the fabric had got out of repair , the roof leaked , and the altar-cloths were tattered and dingy , the great carved crucifix over the altar half broken . But for these things Gilbert cared nothing . In fact he had a scheme in mind to leave this dull village and go back to London . He had a nephew , a half-witted youth of idle habits . This boy he had managed , by various corrupt schemes , to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Holsham on a tiny salary , and himself run off to London , where a clever and courtly priest could always find easy employment singing a daily Mass in some well-endowed chantry , or acting as chaplain to a rich city gild ! So the wretched parishioners of Holsham were left to the mercy of the half-witted Peter-a-Grey , while their priest went to London to seek his fortune . Little duty did Peter-a-Grey perform , save that of exacting to the last penny the tithes and dues that his uncle claimed . Mass went unsaid , and men died unshriven , unless by chance some wandering friar should pass that way who could do these things , and that would be only if he were a priest II2 The Upheaval as well , when all men flocked to secure his services . Meanwhile Peter in his half-witted way amused the new lord of the manor , Sir Geoffrey Harbron , dining daily at his table . For stout Sir Oliver was dead . He had been of the older world , scorning the extravagances of fashion , though fond enough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lay dusty and neglected now , for this son of his was a different sort of man , one who had no use for the simple homespun blue or red cloth that had served his father 's needs . Look at Sir Geoffrey as he walks with his lady in the garden . He wears a flowing gown , called a wippelade , ' with enormous dangling sleeves of a contrasting colour . Round his shoulders is slung a baldric hung with little bells , a fashion introduced from Germany about this time . His flat cap is edged with fur , and his beard , like the beards of Richard II and Henry IV , is trimmed into two neat little peaks . Times have changed since the hardy days of Crecy , and this knight is of the new world . His clothes are sumptuous and fantastic , and his lady is not a whit less magnificent than he . She wears an ample gown of figured velvet from Flanders , adorned with swans and pomegranates . Her hair is held in a network of gold threads , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ headdress , something like the canopy of a bed , // The English Parish covered with stiff cloth of gold . The hair beneath the golden mesh is of the same colour , for this is the latest mode at Court . As the Lady Amice 's hair is dark brown by nature her tiring women spend much time and trouble bleaching it to the fashionable hue , and bitter are the rebukes that they must suffer each and every day . But all these things cost money , and of that there was no superfluity . Half the fields of Holsham Manor lay untilled . The men who should have farmed them were dead , leaving no heirs . The rentroll of the manor had sunk to less than half its former amount . Nor was this all . Men who had before worked on the lord 's demesne for twopence a day now found that twopence was but worth a penny . Naturally the villagers refused to work for the old wages , demanding fourpence a day to enable them to live under the new conditions . Then the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir Geoffrey 's steward , announced that the lord of the manor would no longer accept money-rents from his villeins . They must work their two or three days a week , as their forefathers had before the custom of money-rent grew up . The villagers were furious , and the leader of them all was that Johnson who had fought at Crecy . One can imagine him in his old buff jerkin of stained , padded leather that he had worn on that hard-fought field , with a rough frieze hood wrapped about his head , stumping in his heavy hide boots to and from " 4 The Upheaval his work , and grumbling as he walked , or speaking in harsh , eager tones to a little knot of malcontents gathered at the ale-house . There was something like what we now call a Stay-in strike . ' Finding that open resistance was impossible , the men of Holsham , under Will Johnson 's leadership , decided to do as little as possible of work , as much as possible of damage . There were , however , certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Johnson himself . It was this gang that burned the lord 's barn one night , and fired his hayrick . Nor , rage and curse as he would , could Sir Geoffrey discover the culprits , though he fined the whole manor for refusing to disclose their names . The fine was paid , chiefly from Johnson 's store of plunder , but the slack work and damage went on . Finally in despair Sir Geoffrey had to give way , and agree to pay the fourpenny wage and accept the old rent , even though he had himself been active in Parliament in passing a law against paying greater wages than were customary before the pestilence . For the villagers , however , there was no other form of redress . One or two of them were freeholders , and could thus vote for the election of members to Parliament , but their votes were discounted by the votes of the greater freeholders . As to those who were not freeholders , Parliament was on the whole their enemy ; they had no vote in its election , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parish further rise from villeinage to freeholding . Indeed , but for the vigour of a young boy , Richard II of England , Parliament would have formally forbidden the villein ever to hope to become anything better . No wonder , therefore , that they listened eagerly to preachers of sedition against Church and State ? for such there were , and of every sort . There came one such to Holsham , a lean , earnest man , who cried out against the Church , whose priests , he said , were fat swine rooting in their sties instead of being messengers of God . Let the land that the priests and monks held be taken from them , and all would be well in Church and State . Let every man listen to the wisdom of Master Wyclif , and then would dawn a new heaven and a new earth . This at first sounded attractive enough to the villagers , suffering from the oppression of Gilbert-aGrey and his half-wit nephew . But grizzled old Will Johnson had a word to say to the preacher . " Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wyclif do with the land that he takes from the Church ? " At that the preacher hesitated a little , for , as he very well knew , the chief of Wyclif 's supporters , including the great Duke of Lancaster , John of Gaunt himself , were eager to take away Church lands to increase their own estates . " As I thought , " went on the old soldier ; " what the Church loses the lords will gain . Now , for my part , I see very little gain to us in that , for whatever 116 The Upheaval their faults , as you know well , there are usually more crumbs for the poor man from the Church 's table than from the lord 's . " To that the villagers agreed . And when the preacher went on from talking about the wealth of the Church to attacking the teachings , telling them that the old , familiar services that they loved were false and stupid , they drove him with oaths from their midst . Then there came a friar . A wild-eyed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ priest and noble alike . All should be equal under the King , nor should there be serf nor manor lord . This was more attractive to the people of Holsham , who were at the moment chafing under the demands of the lord of the manor . So when a man in rusty armour rode into Holsham and proclaimed that Wat Tyler , the King of the Commons , was coming to do justice to all and sundry the folk of Holsham rose in a body to join him . For they were raging and sick at heart over the new poll-tax . Already they had had to pay toward the French wars , wars that were sinking into a mere nightmare disaster , and now came this new demand for a shilling from each person over sixteen . The men of Holsham could pay no such sum , and avoided it by making Richard Greely , the parish constable , return a ridiculously false account of the population of the parish . But word had come round that the Government was going to send round men 117 The English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the tax . The villagers were ripe for any mischief , and even Will Johnson , an old man now , for it was forty years since he had drawn bow at Crecy , was willing to join this new leader who sprang from nowhere . There were Holsham men , therefore , among those who marched to Southwark under Tyler 's command . But it is with Holsham that we are concerned , not London . In the village itself the mob committed but one act that could be objected against as criminal . They seized upon the lord 's steward , another lawyer , one Simon Hollingberry , who had been unwise enough not to escape in time . Him they hanged on the nearest tree , for their feelings were very bitter against him . For this savage act there was a reason . This Simon had been slowly clearing tenants away from the manor , smelling out with his thin ferret-nose some instance of neglected feudal duty that would justify the lord in declaring some poor wretch 's holding confiscated , and letting it out again at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be done , and the villagers made it pretty clear what would happen to anyone who rented such land , then sheep could be reared where once corn had grown . No wonder the hanging of Simon Hollingberry was regarded as a righteous act by the villagers . As for the imbecile priest , Peter , he was stripped and thrown out of the village , and a wild-eyed friar , one John Ball , preached in his stead upon the next holy day a fiery sermon iz8 The Upheaval of revolt , urging men to rebel and demand their common rights as children of Adam . But the rebellion failed , as it was bound to fail , for the rebels had neither a selfless enthusiast for leader nor any clear idea of what they wanted . Tyler was a scheming rogue , Ball honest , but not quite sane , and neither of them had really thought out what they intended to put in place of the system they wanted to destroy . But such men of Holsham as returned from that raid on London had glowing tales to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried one , " he rode among us like a king , and cried on us to follow him . That 's the King for me , neighbours , but pity ' t is he 's young yet , and those cunning lords of his will make waste skin of his promises . " Which they duly did . But the rebellion , though a failure , had succeeded , insomuch that never again was any attempt made to enforce the old laws of the manor . From this time on the peasants of Holsham and of all England found that there was less difference between the villein and the freeman than before , that the position of villeinage was becoming nothing but a legal fiction . How this affected the growth of the parish within the manor we shall see . // Parish Life in the diddle ages FEUDALISM was dying fast in England . Indeed , one might say that it was committing suicide . Up and down the land nobles and knights , with armed bands of paid followers , old soldiers of the French wars , were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last great feudal monarch , was dead , murdered by his crafty rival of Lancaster . A sudden gleam , like that of the dying sun , lights upon the field of Agincourt . For a moment the England of Crecy can be seen , bright against the purple clouds of destruction lowering over the land . It is but a passing gleam . The wars of Red Rose and White are to follow , wars in which the nobility destroyed each other and the power of their own class , while neglecting their duties to their dependants . Thus while the absent lord goes his way to battle , and if defeated to the block , the manor court neglects all duties but that of extracting money for the lord 's use . The multifarious duties ? supervision of highways through the manor , looking after the unfortunate and weak , arranging the everyday details of communal life ? are left to the improvised parish vestry to a greater and ever greater degree . I20 Parish Life in the Middle Ages The constable , for instance , was an officer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear of him acting as a parish officer , even presiding over the parish meeting that becomes known as the vestry , ' and acting together with the two parish officers , the churchwardens , who are chosen by the parishioners as their chief representatives . Meanwhile the widowed Queen of England , Catherine , wife of Henry V , has shocked her son 's regents by a runaway marriage with Owen Tudor , a squire of South Wales . Yet that marriage is the beginning of a new world , for the grandson of that Queen and that obscure Welshman is cunning Henry Tudor , King of England , and her great grandson is the man who broke the power of the Roman Church , Henry VIII of many marriages . It would be as well , therefore , to take a last look at the life of Holsham parish as it was in the Middle Ages before new men and new measures alter the world out of recognition , and before the parish , from being mainly a unit of Church organization becomes , for almost four hundred years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sort of little kingdom within the kingdom . Of the everyday life of the Church we should have some idea already . It is the priest 's duty to say Mass each morning , a duty in which he is aided by the parish clerk . In after years we shall find the parish clerk becoming something of a joke , a snuffy , shabby old man who generally acts as sexton I2I The English Parish and church-cleaner as well , whose sonorous " Amen " to the parson 's prayer rings through the church . Of that more later . But in the Middle Ages the clerk is a far more important personage than this . Generally he is some poor man who wants to become a priest , and takes this method of learning his duties . Also he is quite indispensable to the priest . For the priest can not say Mass alone , and it is not every day that the parishioners can attend . But it is part of the clerk 's duties to attend this daily Mass . He has other duties as well . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days , it is the clerk who leads the congregation . They know no Latin , so must trust to the clerk to prompt them when to answer in the service . The clerk , too , carries the bowl of holy water , and sprinkles the congregation with it , a symbolic act of cleansing in preparation for the sacred service of Mass , which we must remember was regarded by the Catholic Church , and is regarded to this day by the High Church party in the Church of England , as a solemn , almost miraculous , act of sacrifice and communion between God and man . On Sundays and holy days every parishioner , unless sick or weather-bound , is expected to attend Mass . From the lord of the manor to the humblest villein they are supposed to meet together in God 's worship . This , of course , does not always happen . There are nobles who get permission to have their private chapels and chaplains , and where this I2 ? Parish Life in the Middle Ages happens there is generally trouble between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will remember that in Holsham parish there was a chantry established in memory of that Sir Aubrey Harbron who had fallen in Palestine . This was usually served by a priest who also acted as private chaplain to the lord of Holsham Manor , and the whole of the records of the parish show that between this chantry priest and the rector of Holsham there was generally trouble . Above all the rectors complained that these chantry priests , far from helping the over-driven parish priest , which they were supposed to do , hindered him by hearing Confessions from members of his congregation , and setting easier penances than the parish priest would have given , accepting presents from those to whom he gave these unlawful favours . Then after Mass had been said upon a Sunday , the parishioners would stay behind to chatter together , and if there was any matter of business needing immediate attention it could be dealt with . But it was on Sunday afternoon that the parish really met for pleasure . Then the young men of the parish would go to the butts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the older men looked on , criticizing and applauding the archery . Here you could hear tales of old days and old deeds : some old warrior of Agincourt perhaps would take his shabby old bow and show these youngsters how I23 The English Parish he had shot down the French as they came swarming in their armour against the thin English line . For others there were races , and dancing on the green to the tune of pipes or fiddles played by some local performers , who probably also played in church when there was music with the service . There would be plenty of good ale and plenty of harmless jollity , and the men would go back to work on Monday all the better for having mingled prayer and enjoyment on the day before . Unfortunately , all the amusements of these rough men of the Middle Ages were not quite so simple and harmless . It is Midsummer Day , a general holi-day . Mass is over , and the folk of Holsham are upon pleasure bent . Let us go and watch their sports . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the people are gathered round it . A wretched dog is swimming wildly about in the water , a duck bound fast to its back , while the spectators are pelting the poor brute with clods and stones . Of course the unfortunate beast dives under water to escape his persecutors , and strives to get rid of the burden of the frightened quacking duck , and of course fails to do either . The brutal sport continues till dog or duck or both are drowned . To-day , however , there is even better sport to be seen . The lord of the manor is celebrating the birth of his son and heir , and has presented a bull to the village . The bull , a savage brute , is tethered to a 124 Parish Life in the Middle Ages stout stake , and every owner of a fierce dog in Holsham gathers round him in a wide circle . Then the dogs are loosed . They are wary beasts , expe-rienced at this game , for a dog who makes mistakes has not long to live @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made a rush for the bull 's nose , and failed to seize it . With a sweep of his great horns the maddened brute throws his enemy high into the air , to fall with a sickening crash outside the ring . The dead dog 's master curses furiously . He had bets on the prowess of his dog ; now he will have to pay out good money , and his family must go short for days . Then , as now , the Englishman was a born gambler . Gradually the wretched bull is worn out , and at last lies down sulkily , a dog gripping either flank , another at his throat . He will give no further sport to-day , so the economical folk of Holsham slaughter him for a feast , tough and stringy as his meat will be . Then comes the wrestling . This we should call sport , rough though it is . The rules are few and simple ? you catch your opponent where you can . There will be more than one broken limb among the villagers to-night ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But times are hard , and life cheap , and only a strong man can hope to survive , so men play as roughly and hard as they work . Sometimes , too , the rough villagers would imitate the sports of their masters , setting up a quintain such as squires and pages used to train themselves I25 The English Parish in the arts of war , a rough master indeed , for if the novice failed to hit the exact centre of the dummy with his lance it swung round upon its pivot and dealt the clumsy warrior such a stroke as would cause him to remember his failure for some days to come . No doubt the warlike among the villagers used their broomsticks and wooden spears with as much skill as their superiors , and there was as much coarse laughter and jesting when Giles Hodge cracked his crown as when some mincing page suffered the same fate in the castle yard . Such are the ordinary holiday diversions of Holsham parish . They occur usually on Sundays or saints ' days , and , within @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Especially is this the case with two great festivals , Christmas Day and May Day . Both of these are heathen in origin ( of course I refer to the festive customs , not the religious aspect of the days ) , but the wise old fathers of the Church have adopted them into Christianity . So the great Yule log , once dedicated to Odin and Thor , is blessed by a Christian priest , and he is present too to bless and take his share in the coarse festival that follows the religious duties of the day . Only the mistletoe , once associated with the blood feasts of the Druids , is banned from the Christian ceremony , and even at that the priest winks , so long as it does not invade the church building . On May Day too religion and joy go hand in hand . Mass is sung in the morning , and after Mass I26 Parish Life in the Middle Ages the maypole is set up on the green , with all due ceremony ? ancient songs and dances that come down from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lord of the manor will be there too , and take a hand in the revels , helping to set up the garlanded pole that was once the totem pole of a savage tribe , now the Church-blessed symbol of spring . There are , however , other festivals more directly associated with the Church , known as Ales . These are in the nature of co-operative picnics , arranged for various purposes . Here is a description of one that took place during the last years of King Henry VI . The beginning of the matter was a leak in the church roof , whereat the village mason looked grave . For not only did it precipitate water down the necks of the congregation on wet days , it also marked the state of decay into which the roof had fallen . " ' T would be waste to patch un up , " old Tom Turner mutters , when he clambers over the roof , noting the weak spots that need immediate care . So a Church Ale is arranged . The two churchwardens , Thomas Carrdon and Jasper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attend and bring with them what they can spare for the church , besides food for the feast . The day proves fine , so the parishioners meet , clad in their best , at the church gate , where Master Humphrey Galwin , the priest , waits to receive them , and say Mass before the feast commences . I27 The English Parish There stands the priest , with his shaven crown , in linen robes , the simplicity of his attire , for this is Low Mass , not the High Mass for which he wears robes of many hues and richly embroidered , contrasting with the coloured jerkins and gowns of the parishioners , who appear clad in their best . Imagine such a crowd to-day , all grey and brown and blue as far as the men are concerned , with dashes of cheap aniline marking off the women . But here , in the fifteenth century , it is different . Men and women alike wear bright colours , and the dyes they use are natural vegetable dyes that will give the commonest cloth the glow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ midsummer noon . Their clothes are simple enough , rough jerkins , loose trousers , and hide shoes , with a hood to cover the head , while the women wear loose , simple gowns . But seen from a distance that crowd looks like a moving mass of jewels under the bright glow of the morning sun . Mass over , all gather in the churchyard , sitting upon the grass , chattering gaily in anticipation of the feast . For it is part of the fun that nobody tells what he or she had brought to contribute to the common stock , and tongues wag freely . " Think you that Goody Hodges has brought one of her famous pies ? " asks one . " Or Widow Dewin her elderberry wine that is so strong and heartening ? " " I hope , " pipes a feeble old voice , " that some I28 Parish Life in the Middle Ages one has brought a soft pasty for a poor old man that has no teeth . " " You shall see anon , Father Kaler , " cries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forgotten , no , nor Gaffer Mudge either . " " I should hope not , indeed , " cries a pettish old voice . " Old Mudge , Gaffer Mudge , aye , there 'd ' a ' been two feet of steel in any that neglected poor old Gaffer Mudge ? eh , well , forty years gone , forty years gone . " Aye , when you slew the French knight at Agincourt , Gaffer , " cries a boy 's voice . " Tell us about that . " " Aye , aye , " chime in other young voices , " tell us about that , Gaffer . " So the old man 's piping voice begins its oftrepeated tale that has grown with the years . When he first told it his doughty deed had consisted of a single-handed victory over a French man-at-arms . Now his victim has become a knight of high degree , and sometimes more than one . " That 's well enough , " grumbles a rough , hardfaced man who has but lately returned from following my Lord of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faction . " But there 's that coming that will make you bowmen look small . " Curious eyes are turned on the speaker . " Aye , " he continues , " harquebuseers , men of Flanders with long hand-guns . I saw them among Lord Warwick 's men . They 'll cheapen your cloth- // The English Parish yard arrows , with their belching fire-pieces that will smash proof-plate into scrap-iron . " This tale , however , nobody believes . They turn instead to listen to other stories of ghosts and dragons , mingled with the common chatter of village life . As they talk the good things that each man has brought are unpacked and handed round , and great mugs of ale wash them down . A barrel of ale has been got by public subscription , and every one is free to dip his mug as often as he will , till the barrel stands but a fragrant empty memory of good times past . Then comes the collection , and well-fed men with a quart or more of good ale inside them are in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Nor is this the only excuse for an Ale . Once when Parson Gower lost his fine horse the villagers , by the mouths of the churchwardens , called together an Ale , and the parson , who was much beloved , was surprised to receive an invitation on the very day of the feast , which had been kept secret from him . Then when all was done the churchwardens brought to him the money that had been gathered , and shyly asked him to accept it for a new horse . Men noticed that Parson Gower 's new horse was a thin and scraggy beast , very unlike the fine horse that had died ; but old Widow Hugget came to Mass next Sunday in a new red frieze cloak to keep the cold from her old bones , and Parson Gower won double love and respect from his parishioners thereby . 130 Parish Life in the Middle Ages Such was the life of a parish in Merrie England ? coarse , hearty ; sometimes , no doubt , rough and cruel , but , at any rate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ problems and new ideas . The old easy days when men accepted what was given like children and asked no questions were fast passing away . In some ways no doubt the new age was a better age , but it is simply wilful blindness to pretend that there was nothing in the dead Middle Ages worthy of regret . It was a harsh , rude time , but it had the virtues as well as the vices of such a time , and its chief virtue was this , that if you could not yourself climb up the ladder of life at least you could not kick other people down it . A born villein might be doomed to die no more than a villein ? he could not be flung out to die a starving outcast . With the breakdown of that stable condition of life we get the vagrancy problem , and it is in a great degree to solve that problem , the difficulty unknown to the Middle Ages of the man who had nowhere to go and nothing to do if he got there , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ // eNew Lamps for Old THE old lamp that had lighted Christendom for fifteen hundred years was glowing but dimly when the Tudors established themselves on the English throne . There is no need to accept as truth the accusations against the Catholic Church made by the violent reformers . Even on the admission of Catholics such as More and Erasmus the Church was in a bad way , and something ought to be done about it . The question was , What could be done about it ? There were several causes for the troubles in which the Church was now involved , and if we want to understand how those troubles affected our parish of Holsham they must be briefly sketched . Some were world-wide in their scope , others more local , and specially affecting England . Of all the things that combined to lower the reputation of the Church the character of the Popes of this period is probably the greatest . For this is the age of Alexander VI ( Rodrigo Borgia was his family name ) , who was a noted poisoner . Although he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still there were others who , though possibly not bad as men , were unbelievers in religion , easy-going , 132 New Lamps for Old luxurious livers ; men utterly unfit for the position of head of Christ 's Church . With such men at the head it was not easy to see how reforms were to be carried out from inside the Church , since the first essential reform was to abolish bad Popes . It may be agreed that murderers ought to be hanged , but we do not expect the murderer to sentence and execute himself . Nor was this all . For throughout Europe , owing to the Renaissance , a great movement that can not be fully explained here , men were beginning to question all sorts of things once accepted as certain truths . For instance , men asked whether the world was really flat , and whether the stars were but pinpoints of light shining through from the glory of heaven . Above all , men were asking " Why ? " Naturally many of the accepted views of the Church were examined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Church had no better answer to any problem than , " You must believe because the Church tells you " ? which is not very satisfying . Those were the great world-causes at work to bring about a religious change . Let us look at the parish of Holsham and see what is its condition . In the first place we should call the people of the parish very superstitious . Few of them could give you any idea of the meaning of those services they attended week by week . They simply did as they were told , and left it at that . This may be a defect , of course , but we shall find that even after the 133 The English Parish Reformation there was plenty of superstition in England . People who are simple and not learned will be superstitious whatever their religion , and as long as their superstitions are not of a cruel and savage sort it does not much matter . Then perhaps we should object to the very showy nature of the services , but the reformers themselves found that something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gave people the old colour and show in their service they made up for it by lurid sermons and awful descriptions of hell fire that thrilled their hearers as satisfactorily as the old pageantry of Rome . It was not these difficulties that perplexed the mind of good Master Robert Innes , priest of Holsham in the early years of the reign of Henry VIII . Had you spoken to him about the state of religion in the country he would have talked with zeal and knowledge , for he was a learned man . The Harbrons had gone from Holsham , and their lands had passed to a new owner , Sir John Perry , a man who had made his way in the corrupt Court of Henry VII by financial cleverness and lack of scruples . Sir John was an unpleasant sort of person , grasping and harsh , but he was full of the new spirit of learn ing , and a great inquirer into hidden knowledge . In Master Robert Innes he had found a man after his own heart to be parson of Holsham . Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enabled him to get books at moderate prices and in fair numbers , and he thought deeply over his reading . 134 New Lamps for Old He was far from satisfied with things as they were , even in his little parish . For example , he would have told you that there were far too many clergymen who neither read nor thought , and for proof would have referred you to the near-by monastery of Durlington . Here , he would tell you , there were monks who owned large tracts of land , also the church of Torrington , a rich living , from which they drew much wealth . But for the care of the folk of Torrington they appointed a vicar , at a ridiculously low salary , some poor illeducated man who could hope for nothing better , and must make up his miserable living by trading . " But what can you expect , " he would add , " when there are actually monks who can not read a simple book , and can scarce scrawl their names ? What will such men care @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you round his own parish , and show you the well-managed little school , at which Isaac Hobson , the parish clerk , acts as schoolmaster . Here children are taught to read and write , and do a little simple arithmetic , and , above all , the meaning of religion and the duties that true piety involves . " But , " he would add sadly , " what can I do , here in this little outlying parish , while in great , rich towns there are not enough schools for the people 's needs , and men worship God without knowing why they worship Him ? " Had you asked this man whether he was in favour 135 The English Parish of a reformation in religion he would have answered " Yes , " as would such men as Sir Thomas More , Bishop Fisher , or the great Cardinal Wolsey , who thought himself master of kingdom and king alike . But had you asked any of these , from the great Red Cardinal himself to the humble parish priest of Holsham , whether they were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ begun in Germany their answer would have been an emphatic " No ! " What they wanted was that the Church should reform itself , not that an entirely new sort of religion should be set up . Now a few words with yeoman Dawes , one of the churchwardens , a stout farmer , well enough off , and , though he can not read or write , a man of shrewd common sense . He farms a good part of Sir John Perry 's domain on lease , and employs no less than ten of his fellow-parishioners . He is a stout man , comfortable-looking , and the house wherein he dwells is as stout and comfortable as himself . Yeoman Dawes is rising in the world , and the fashion of his dress will tell you so . The old rough tunic and breeches that sufficed his father will not do for him . He must needs go to a tailor in Torrington and have clothing of the latest cut , short puffed breeches , long stockings , and a tight-cut waistcoat of green . He sits in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and glowers suspiciously . He will grumble at the taxes that the King has levied to pay for his wars , and at the extravagance 136 New Lamps for Old of my Lord Cardinal of York . Above all , he will grumble at the wealth of the monasteries , their broad lands , for which they pay , he says , less than their fair share of taxation , and their greed in seeking for yet more land . He will probably tell some scan-dalous story of a dying man denied absolution till he had left his lands to the Church , and , indeed , there were cases of this sort . If you ask him for a practical remedy he will tell you that if he were King he would take land from the fat monks and give it to good yeomen like himself , who would make better use of it . Only he will not tell you anything of the sort if he thinks that his words might reach the King 's ears , for Henry VIII is still the Defender of the Faith and patron @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to you that there is talk of the King taking another wife . " And that 's a pity , " he will add , " for a friend of mine tells me that the Queen 's Grace is a good lady enough , while this new wench that the King has in mind , one Anne Bullen , they say , an east country lass , is haughty and over-gay . " Go one step lower . Here are Giles Hodge , one of yeoman Dawes 's men , and William Grooby , who works for Sir John Perry , countrymen both of the Weald , in their old grey working tunics and tattered breeches . These , when they have grumbled at the weather and the price of ale , will perhaps be per-suaded to speak of Church affairs . They will have other words than those of yeoman 137 The English Parish Dawes . They are satisfied enough with the Church as it is . They do n't understand the service , but it was good enough for their fathers and grandfathers ; why should they want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a courtesy title ) is new-fangled in his ways , schooling the children and explaining religion in his sermons . " But a good man for all that , " cries Giles ; " for was it not he who brought me everything he could when my lass was dying ? aye , and buried her without fee or charge , and gave wine out of his own store to help those that came to the burying with the day so cold and wet ! " As for the suggestion that monastic land would do better in the hands of yeoman Dawes and his like , they will simply laugh at it . " Aye , " they will grumble , " well enough for him . But what of us poor folks ? They 're good masters , the monks , whatever men say against them , and that 's more than can be said for Master Dawes . " " Aye , or for Sir John either , " adds another grumbler . " A hard man is Sir John , that will take land from a poor man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when Master Dawes was no better than any of us here , and Sir John 's father a ' torney in Torrington . " Now to visit Sir John . Him you will not find in Holsham , for he is in London at King Harry 's Court . There you will find him , clad in the height of fashion , trunk hose and puffed breeches , with a purple coat 138 New Lamps for Old all padded and slashed , till he looks monstrously fat , though in truth he is but of normal size . That is a delicate compliment to the King himself , whose body is as gross as his mind . Sir John will mince no words . Monks and nuns and all that crew are useless lack-wits , to be done away with as soon as possible . Then the King could reduce taxation . This , he explains , would be done in two ways . In the first place , the land that the King took for himself would produce more money to keep up his Court . In the second place @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the clergy into that of nobles and gentry such as Sir John it would pay its fair share of taxes , instead of being almost exempt as Church land was . As for religion , well , one was as good as another . They all served to keep ignorant , common folk quiet , and wise men regarded all alike as fables . So let the King decide what the religion should be , and let all obey him . Thus , when Henry declared himself head of the Church in England Holsham parish accepted the change , if not willingly , at least quietly . There was nobody strong enough to contest the King 's will , and even Master Innes , when he saw that the form of service was to remain unchanged , made the best of it and bowed to the inevitable . But when it came to suppressing the monasteries opinion was far more hostile , both that of the priest and that of the layman . The monks were not per-sonally unpopular , and though Robert Innes would 139 The English Parish have reformed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the use of the English Bible an unqualified blessing . For no sooner was the Bible established in the Church than it was read assiduously by two or three men in the village who had their private reasons for disliking the priest , and proceeded to formulate religions of their own that denied the necessity for the existence of priests . It took all the weight of the King 's hand ? and that was not light ? to prevent religious anarchy developing all over England . In Holsham , for instance , there was trouble with one John Crosby , who asserted that if men would be cleansed from sin they must be bathed in a river instead of being baptized in the ordinary way , and built up on this foundation a weird religion of his own . However , Crosby went to prison , and for the moment his new religion was scotched . Besides all this , Hoisham already had its troubles in dealing with poverty and wandering vagrants . When the monks were added to these , the people , even those who had at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the break-up of the monasteries , changed their opinion . It was in the next reign , under a boy-king whose selfish regents ruled in the interests of their own class and kind , that the real meaning of the Reformation came home to the villagers of Hoisham . On the death of their good parson , Robert Innes , a new man came , one Hezekiah Dorman , who had been in Germany and there learned what every man in Hoisham , 140 New Lamps for Old except a few of the richer men , considered the blackest heresy . Under his rule the beautiful images were taken from the church , which was left looking as bare and ugly as a barn . Mass was no more sung at the high altar ; instead men must go to a service of long prayers and a fierce sermon that denounced as wicked not only the religion that the men of Holsham had known from generation to generation , but their amusements as well . From bear- and bullbaiting to harmless maypole dancing , Christmas feasts , and the pageantry in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the adventures of popular heroes such as Robin Hood were represented ? all alike were denounced as of the devil . A new faith of gloom and tears was all that this parson had to offer his parishioners . He would not even wear the gay robes that it had been the pride of Holsham parish to provide for their priests ; instead he wore a black gown as grim and sordid as the service that he conducted . Worse still : because their funds were used to pray for souls the Gild of St Thomas lost its saved wealth , a few pounds only it is true , for it had never been a rich gild , but the poor were the worst sufferers thereby . Also the social life of the parish lost something that it has never regained , the sense of goodfellowship and common interest that the gild kept up among its members . Nor could it be charged against this little village gild , as perhaps might be charged against the larger bodies of the towns , that 141 The English Parish it was a drag @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ except exist to give good cheer to poor men . Now , for the benefit of a few greedy and grasping men , it must be suppressed . Again , the new owner of the manor , Dudley Perry , was a great encloser . By hook or by crook he would have as much land as he could and fence it in . This in itself might have done no damage , for there were enclosed villages where life was easier than those that still clung to the old common field system . Properly enclosed , well-manured land would produce more and better crops . But in Holsham the new lord wanted wool , and instead of cultivating the en-closed land he put it down to grass . Never in all the history of Holsham had there been such a time of misery , for now there were men who had little or no land of their own ? a thing unknown in the Middle Ages ? and since only a few shepherds were needed on Sir Dudley 's land , many of the villagers were on the point of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Holsham welcomed Queen Mary ? Her coming seemed the end of a long nightmare . Gloomy-faced , half-starved men welcomed a queen who , it was hoped , would bring back the good old days that were associated in all men 's minds with the old religion that she was known to profess . But the dream was not to last long . First came word of the Spanish match . Now , there were many who had been glad enough to see 142 New Lamps for Old grim-faced Hezekiah Dorman chased from his parsonage to flee overseas , and a jolly-faced priest , Anthony Gibbs , installed in his place . They were glad to hear the familiar Mass sung in the desecrated church , rather than the gloomy litanies favoured by the reformers , but nevertheless objected to an English queen marrying a Spanish king . " For , " they said , " what if there should be a son , King of Spain and of England as well ? " They feared , with reason , that in that case England would be but the tail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seething with discontent . Henry Dawes , son of old yeoman John , was a gentleman now , and a Justice of the Peace . The new religion had suited him very well , giving him a large slice of monastery land and the position of a freeholder . He feared that some day , when she was strong enough , the Queen would take this land from him , and he must return to the mire whence he had risen . There was support , therefore , for Sir Thomas Wyatt 's rebellion among some of the folk of Holsham , though most sat at home and at heart wished the rebels ill . Then came the burning of John Golder and his wife . They were a couple who had heard with respect and adopted the new teachings , not from motives of pocket , but from genuine conviction , and , though they were not popular in the village , even those who disagreed with their views and disliked 143 The English Parish the sullen gloom of their creed felt a glow of sympathy when they saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been reserved for witches and unnatural murderers . It seemed a terrible penalty for the offence . They would not have had the least objection to this couple 's being imprisoned till they changed their views , or hanged at once if they attempted in any way to rebel in favour of them . But burning seemed a little harsh , even to the fiercest Catholic in Holsham . Mary 's popularity was very much on the wane . Loud , too , were the curses when it was known that , owing to her husband 's demands , Mary had been forced into an expensive French war and lost Calais , her last possession in France . She died , having in five short years made sure that Catholicism should no longer dominate English life as it had before her father 's day . Men waited with bated breath to know what her successor would do with the tangle that she left to be unravelled . Yet if there were problems unknown to the Middle Ages , and a new ill-feeling between man and man in this new age @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of wealth and the growth of a new security of life and property , as the hardhanded Tudors put down the riotous and disorderly of all classes , noble and vagrant alike . The great mansion of the Perrys is very different from the grim stone hall , a place of safety , but by no means a home , that had served the needs of the 144 New Lamps for Old vanished Harbrons . Not yet are the full glories of Holsham Manor developed ? that is to come ? but already there are softer lines about the grim grey hall , rooms added to it that serve for pleasure and not solely for safety , wherein wide windows let in the sun , now that men no longer fear that such windows would let in the arrows of an enemy as well . There are gardens too about the old house , and flowers for beauty , where once had been the bailey , a space of grass kept to pasture cattle in time of siege . Even the moat is no longer so much a necessity as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its brown water . As for the village , the mud and wattle hovels of the Middle Ages are giving place to real cottages , small whitewashed homes of timber and plaster , or now and then of rough brick or undressed stone with roofs of thatch , or even tiles . The medieval manor of Holsham is something that we can only dimly imagine , so unlike is it in outward form to anything that we know . The Tudor village is beginning to assume the familiar shape of to-day . // CHAPTER XII e ? ( ew Problems THE new age that was beginning had its own problems for the parishes of England , and very serious problems they were . The Middle Ages had not been without their difficulties , but there was one very special difficulty that had not existed in the Middle Ages that now had to be considered : the difficulty of the destitute and homeless . In the Middle Ages every man had his place in society , his piece of property , large or small , that could not be taken away from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and good behaviour . This sounds an ideal condition , but it had the one defect that under these conditions what we know as personal freedom was impossible . Even the wealthy baron was not free : he could not sell or otherwise dispose of his estate . The ordinary serf was in the same plight , only his conditions of tenure were more rigorous . He was bound to the soil , and , though he could not be deprived of his land , he could not voluntarily leave it and go somewhere else to find a better piece of land or a more profitable occupation . To this there were but two exceptions . If a villein could get himself ordained priest he was free of his villeinage , and if he could escape from his manor , and 146 New Problems remain for a year and a day in a chartered town , he could no longer be claimed by his lord . Freedom came gradually , and freedom proved to be not all that such advocates of liberty as John Ball had prophesied . For the man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in search of something better than the life of a villein found that he was also free to starve if his search failed . As long as he was on a manor somebody was responsible for his welfare . But as a wandering labourer he was his own keeper , and nobody was charged with the duty of caring for him if he fell by the wayside . But it was repugnant to the Christian feeling of the Middle Ages that a man should starve , and so we find that from the time when wandering beggars became common the parish began , as a matter of charity , to look after them . This became more usual after the Tudors came to the throne , for during their reign the manor organization became very weak indeed . This was due to the deliberate policy of the new rulers of England . Their title to the throne was bad , and therefore they were in serious danger of rebellion , especially when they began to rule in a fashion that was sure to offend the remaining members of the old feudal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was his position as lord of one or more manors over the lives and fortunes of whose inhabitants he had a great measure of control . Deliberately , therefore , the Tudor kings took away local business from the manor court , and 147 The English Parish gave it to the Justice of the Peace , a royal official . For instance , the Perrys , who took the place of the old Harbrons as lords of Hoisham Manor , had little power as lords of the manor . As Justices of the Peace they did , it is true , most of the business once done by the manor lords , but they did it under the strict supervision of the King , through his Court of Star Chamber . They were no longer half-independent local autocrats , but officials serving the central government . With this there went a sudden increase of duties . For if the likeliest leaders of rebellion were discontented feudalists the mass of rebels were the wandering poor who now began to appear in England . These were of many types . There were honest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There were dishonest men " looking for work and praying that they might not find it . " There were old soldiers unwilling to return to settled life , and inclined to live by plunder and petty theft . There were definite criminal gangs who would swindle or rob as circumstances suggested , and were quite capable of putting a small village or even a petty town to ransom , threatening to burn down the place unless their demands were satisfied . Something had got to be done about these people , and the easiest unit for the central government to use in dealing with them was the parish supervised by the Justice of the Peace . For the parish already existed as a corporate body , used to carrying out certain business . It was easier 148 New Problems to thrust more business upon this already existing institution than to create any new authority to deal with new problems . But it was after the dissolution of the monasteries that this problem became so severe that panic laws had to be devised to deal with it . For at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and food given for charity , and unless he were by nature a criminal , as some of the vagrants no doubt were , he was not driven to crime by starvation and despair . When the monastery was no longer there to relieve his necessities the position of the vagrant was indeed grim . The men of Holsham found this out quickly enough . For no sooner were the monasteries dissolved than swarms of vagrants descended upon the village . Not only did these men and women beg from all and sundry , they committed every sort of crime . Men would find their fields reaped for them in the night , their barns rifled , their orchards robbed . Fires carelessly lighted by wandering men would burn a barn . And there were more serious crimes laid to these folks ' charge . There was the matter of Thomas Bailey , for instance . The lords of Holsham Manor had rights of warren over their land ? that is , the right of hunting ground and small game , as distinct from the red deer ? and Thomas was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happened was never known . One night Thomas came to the inn in great excitement . The lord 's warrens , he said , were being 149 The English Parish systematically poached , and Thomas had been promised a reward if he could bring the poachers to justice . He thought that he had found out the whereabouts of the men , but would say no more , for fear of having to share the promised rewards . Next day Thomas was not to be found , but three days after his body , the head battered in , was discovered naked beneath a gorse covert . He had been murdered and stripped . That might have been all that ever would have been heard of the matter had not a man walked into an inn at Torrington , where the dead man was well known , wearing a coat that the innkeeper recognized as belonging to Bailey . He could give no better account of himself than that he was wandering in search of work , and was promptly arrested and hanged . But the folk of Holsham were panic-stricken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as well as begging and robbery nobody 's life would be safe . There were nasty stories too told over pots of ale , of other villages where women left alone in their houses had been approached by beggars who , when they discovered that they had but an unprotected woman to deal with , had become strong thieves , killing or beating their prey , and stripping the house , even sometimes taking away the very clothes that their unfortunate victim was wearing . Nor was the panic confined to the poorer sort of people . Parliament passed ferocious laws , and soon the parish beadle of Holsham was a busy man . For Sir John Perry was a stern magistrate , and the law 150 New Problems clear and exact . Every poor man was to go back to his own parish , and there work or maintenance was to be provided for him . Otherwise any person caught wandering without means of subsistence was to be flogged ? " stripped from the waist upwards , and whipped till his or her back be bloody , " the law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The second offence involved branding as well as flogging , and for the third offence the vagrant could be prosecuted as a felon and hanged . Soon the sight of some wretched man or woman screaming in agony under the beadle 's lash was common enough on Holsham green , and the parish accounts contain entries of expenses for keeping in order the stocks and whipping-post for the benefit of the vagrants . But this did not solve the problem , and for two reasons . In the first place , magistrates more humane than Sir John Perry would not put these ferocious laws into force . In the second place , there was no machinery by which the people of Holsham could carry out the law about seeing to their own poor and impotent folk . For no longer was each man the owner of a small patch of land . There were landless , or almost landless , men in the village who must depend in old age or sickness on the casual charity of the rest of the parish , administered by the parson . So a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ parish was responsible for collecting in church from his parishioners money which was to be applied to the needs of the poor and old . From this fund was to be 151 The English Parish purchased stocks of material upon which the ablebodied poor could be set to work , and it was to be used to provide comforts for the old and the sick . The parson of Holsham preached a burning sermon upon the text , " Am I my brother 's keeper ? " in which every parishioner was exhorted to give of his comfort for the benefit of others less fortunate than himself , the money so collected to be handed over to the churchwardens to be used as the law directed , but the results were pitiful . Many gave what they could , but others were less generous . Yeoman Dawes , the wealthiest man in the village next to the lord of the manor himself , gave but little , and that grudgingly . " For why , " he grumbled afterward , " should my hard-earned money be taken from me to pamper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was a harsh man , with little human sympathy or Christian charity , but unfortunately his type were becoming very common in the new world . So that experiment failed , and in the last years of Elizabeth a new law was passed to deal with the poor . By this two new parish officers were created , the overseers of the poor . These , unlike the church-wardens , were not elected by the Parish meeting , but chosen by two Justices of the Peace for the county wherein the parish lay . Then these men were to report to the parish vestry how much money would be needed to look after the poor of the parish , and to raise a rate for that purpose . 152 New Problems Let us look at a report of a Holsham vestry meeting after the beginning of this new Poor Law . John Eggam and William Barnes the overseers ask for a rate of sixpence in the pound , a " sixpenny book , " as the records quaintly term it . That means that every owner of land in Holsham parish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that land , a value that is ascertained by the overseers themselves going round and finding how much rent is paid for each piece of land or house , and , if the owner occupies the dwelling and no rent is paid , how much rent it would be worth if it were let out . There is much grumbling at first . Sir Herbert Dawes , descendant of the grumbling old yeoman Dawes of Henry VIII 's reign , complains that he has been over-assessed ? that is , that too much value has been set upon his lands . He appeals to Quarter Sessions , the court meeting four times a year in Maidstone , consisting of all the Justices of the Peace in the county , though , in fact , not all attend . But the magistrates know Sir Herbert pretty well ; moreover , these are the days when Star Chamber exercised a pretty strict supervision over the Justices , and corrupt decisions would ensure a swift and sharp rebuke , possibly even a fine for the Justice or Justices concerned . So the appeal is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pay . As we shall see , had this event occurred a hundred years later the decision might well have been different . With the money so collected the overseers proceed 153 The English Parish to tackle the problem of the poor folk in Holsham . Those who can work but have no work to do are set to weave wool , a supply of which is bought for the purpose . Those who are poor and old , or sick , are granted small sums of money weekly to keep them from starvation . For the " sturdy rogues and vagabonds , " the men or women who still persist in wandering about begging , there is the whipping-post and a new institution , the bridewell , or house of correction , where they can be imprisoned and set to hard labour till removed back to their own parishes . This device of rates on property was beginning to be used very freely in those days , and for rather a curious reason ? namely , that Columbus discovered America . A number of people , humorous and serious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there can be no doubt that the development of the parish as a rate-collecting and ratespending body is due to this voyage of a Genoan seaman into the undiscovered glory of the sunset . For in that sunset-land he found gold , not the wonderful , swiftly dying gold of the evening sun , but hard metal , that was carried by shiploads to Spain , and thence spread through Europe . Here is an allegory to illustrate the point . Suppose that fifty pigs are brought to market , and there are but twenty-five people who want to buy pigs , then the sellers will have to lower their prices till pigs are so cheap that men who came to market meaning to buy only one pig now buy two , otherwise half the 154 New Problems pigs will remain unsold . Suppose , on the other hand , that there are one hundred possible buyers for the fifty pigs , then there will be keen competition for the purchase of the animals , and the sellers will make a large profit . For " pigs " read " money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lot of money in a country money will be cheap . That is , other things will be dear . Men will not give as much bread for a penny when pennies are plentiful as they will when pennies are scarce . This is exactly what happened to Holsham parish when the gold of America began to affect England . Prices of things that are bought with money went up , because money became more plentiful . Not only this , there were other causes at work to raise prices , so that while money became , say , half as valuable as it had been , prices rose to three times their former height . Therefore such men as the parson , who depended on a fixed or more or less fixed sum from his fields and tithes , were much worse off than before . In a place like Torrington , where , as has been explained in the preceding chapter , all this income went to the monks of Durlington , who paid a vicar to do the parish work , this was even more the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while expenses rose very much . The result was that the charities that the rector of Holsham had been wont to disperse had to be curtailed . Moreover , he could no longer keep the church and churchyard in good order out of the proceeds of 155 The English Parish his tithes and land ; it was hard enough for him to keep up a decent standard of living himself . In addition to this , clergymen were often appointed in these troubled times because of their subservience to the party that might happen to be in power in the Church rather than for their personal fitness , and these men neglected their duties even when they could do them . So the parishioners of Holsham had to meet together and raise rates for such purposes as church repair . This was specially necessary during such periods as the reign of Edward VI , when the old device for raising these funds , the Church Ale , was regarded as wicked and forbidden . Then there were the highways . Once it had been the duty of the lord of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too was transferred to the parish . In each parish two officials were named , again by two neighbouring Justices of the Peace , to act as overseers of the highroad , whose duty it was to claim from every parishioner a certain amount of work on the highroads , or money in lieu of such work . These men , too , might ask for a rate from the parishioners for highway purposes . Thus by the end of Elizabeth 's reign we find that the parish has taken over most of the duties of the old manor , and , in addition , is responsible , under the Justice of the Peace , for the new Poor Law rendered necessary by new conditions . // The Unrestful Years THE problem of working out the exact proportions of the various religions in England at the beginning of Elizabeth 's reign is one that has never been solved . Some , like Froude and Macaulay , would have us believe that the country 's sympathies were Protestant . Gasquet , the modern Catholic historian , on the other hand , declares @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hoped that the new Queen would follow a moderate Catholic policy . Probably the truth lies somewhere between these two extremes . Certainly in the thinly peopled districts of the north and west the people were mainly of the old faith . This was true also of the older nobility of the rest of England . On the other hand , in the towns that were growing in size and prosperity , especially in the great trading district of England , the east and south-east , the better-off citizens were not only Protestants , but what came to be known as Puritans . For some strange reason we are always told that this term means that those to whom it was applied desired greater purity of life than those of other religions . This , of course , is wrong . The Puritan claimed that his religion was the only pure form of Christianity . 157 The English Parish The mass of the population were probably quite willing to regard the Queen as the head of the Church provided that Church was not too unlike the old familiar Church that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's reign it did not seem that this condition would be fulfilled . For no sooner was Elizabeth on the throne than those extreme Protestants who had fled abroad under Mary returned in full vigour , many of them having learned yet more extreme opinions at Geneva , where a man called John Calvin taught a religion of the utmost rigour and fierceness , afterward known from its method of Church government as Presbyterianism . This these returned exiles hoped to make the official religion of England . But before we go on to consider the effects of these things on the life of Holsham parish there is one point that must be made clear if the religious struggles of this period are to be understood . Admirers of Puritanism have represented the Puritans as heroic souls demanding from a tyrannical Church and King the right to worship as they would . Mrs Hemans , author of the poem Casabianca , in another poem on the Pilgrim Fathers represents them as fleeing to America in order to seek " freedom to worship God . " Which is rather funny if one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the days of the Pilgrim Fathers , would have been whipped almost or quite to death if she had dared to demand such freedom for herself under their rule . The harsh facts are that no Church or sect of the 158 The Unrestful Years sixteenth or seventeenth centuries would have anything to do with freedom of worship . What each desired was the establishment of its own beliefs and the persecution of all others . More , if it be admitted that the Puritan never resorted to quite as drastic methods of persecution as the Catholic ( he did not as a rule burn his religious opponents ) , his persecution was more thorough in other ways . The Catholic Church persecuted open heretics , and punished certain forms of evil living and dishonesty . Otherwise it interfered little with a man 's private life and amusements , and allowed its followers a certain liberty of private opinion as long as it was kept private . The Church of England followed more or less the same policy . Aggressive Catholics , such as the Jesuits , were hanged for treason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Catholic Church in England included the design to do away with the rule of Elizabeth , who , whatever her private views , was in name a Protestant . People who openly denied the doctrines of the Church were imprisoned or fined . But there was no compulsion on any man to believe anything . If he went to church nobody inquired how he spent the rest of the Sunday , and , until after the Puritans , in Cromwell 's time , had persecuted the Church of England with extreme bitterness , secret meetings of Puritans were winked at if the persons attending them confined themselves to religious exercises and did not talk politics . The Puritan , on the other hand , when he perse-159
