George VI last week did something no British King before him ever did : he went to an airdrome and , in a hangar , personally decorated five members of the R. A. F. Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross were Flying Officers K. C. Doran , who led the raid on the Kiel Canal , and A. McPherson , who scouted for it ; T. M. Wetherall Smith and John Barrett , who landed in heavy seas to rescue the crew of the torpedoed Kensington Court . To Sergeant Pilot W. E. Willits , who brought his ship out of a dive and landed it after the first pilot had been killed by a bullet , the King gave the Distinguished Flying Medal ( for non-Commissioned officers ) . Eldest of the medalists was 26 , youngest 21 . <P> Britain intends to turn out some 3,000 new R. A. F. officers each month , and if real air war starts , 36,000 a year will be none too many for replacement . That the cramped , foggy British Isles are no place to train fliers was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ action , 122 ; killed in training , 102 . <P> Canada is to be Britain 's air-training ground . Turning out 12,000 pilots every 28 weeks is to be Canada 's big contribution to the war , and this , in the opinion of Anthony Eden , " might well be the decisive factor . " The so-called Empire Air Training Plan went into gear last week with the arrival in Ottawa of commissions from Australia and New Zealand . Preparatory work had been done by a committee headed by Arthur Balfour Baron Riverdale of Sheffield , 62 , one of Britain 's biggest , baldest , blondest , bluffest steel tycoons . Heading the Australian delegation was J. V. Fairbairn , Minister of Civil Aviation , a redheaded air fighter of World War I. Chief representative for Canada is Lieut . Colonel William Avery Bishop , V. C. , honorary Marshal of the Royal Canadian Air Force . Now 45 , short , chubby , softspoken , he scarcely looks today like the fierce-flying Ace Bishop who shot down at least 72 German ships in 1914-18 and once took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one by one as they tried to leave the ground . <P> To train 12,000 pilots , Canada will need 1,500 ships over &; above Britain 's war needs . Her infant air industry , though encouraged by a $10,000,000 " educational " order from the mother country last year , is by no means equipped to supply such a quantity . Last week the Empire Training Planners waited only the embargo-lifting vote by Congress to place $100,000,000 worth of orders in the U. S. , for 600 light trainers , 900 fighters and bombers . Of this cost , Britain will pay half , Canada onequarter , Australia and New Zealand one-eighth each . <P> Training airdromes will be built at 100 sites , mostly in wide-open western Canada . Trainers will be shipped to Canada from the other three countries , and in addition to pilots , some 100,000 mechanics , riggers , engine fitters , etc. , etc. , will be taught in expanded schools of Canada 's youth training organization . Enlistments for all these services were reported last week to be far in excess of requirements @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
