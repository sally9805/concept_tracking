txt Astrology I am moved to protest against the language used by R. P. Daily in his letter to THE Try as . The mere fact that astrology uses astronomical information does not in any way bear on the question of whether it is or is not an " honorable " study . The fundamental basis of astrology is a belief that the positions of the stars have a specific effect on specific doings of particular persons . This basic idea has not yet been demonstrated  --  and until it is demonstrated we shall have to consider astrology as a tissue of unproved assumptions , many probably false . When , then , an astrologer charges the public for " advice " or " guidance " on so inadequate a basis , it is no inaccuracy to speak of such an activity as a racket . STEPHEN G. RICH , Verona , N.
