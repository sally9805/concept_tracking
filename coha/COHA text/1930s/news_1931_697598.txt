To my mind , the committee would rave reached the limit of its duty if t had expressed its views to Con ; ress , but in the end obeyed the ' epresentative spokesmen of the milinns who require this aid .

To the Editor of The New York Times : May I add a line or two to THE TIMES editorial on stage censorship , and perhaps help toward an understanding of the situation in England , especially when such a remarkable play as " The Green Pastures " is concerned ?

The play had been given in the garden of the old Charterhouse , and when we desired to present it for public performance in a licensed theatre the censor  --  the Lord Chamberlain  --  had to be consulted . His office explained that a play written and performed two hundred years before the acts existed could hardly be licensed , but we were advised to omit the actual presentation of the - Deity ( Adonai ) as much as possible , and upon any occasion to treat the subject with reverence and discrimination . This we have always endeavored to do in America and England . I saw " The Green Pastures " some months ago , and have done all I could to explain the beauty and purpose of the presentation to authorities at home . The censor 's office has proved its broad-mindedness in many ways , and it has recently withdrawn its veto upon some very " broad-minded " plays .

" To the Editor of The New York Times : In connection with The TIMES editorial reference to Senator Cutting 's quotation of an alleged prophetic anti-corporation utterance of President Lincoln , and your challenge that the Senator cite the source , it may be interesting to know that this very quotation is considered by Miss Helen Nicolay in her " Personal Traits of Abraham Lincoln . " She introduces the subject thus : " Remembering the wisdom of Lincoln ? ? people have sought to make him a prophet for this generation . Not finding what they wanted among his words , the unscrupulous have not hesitated to invent them . My father ( remember , he was Lincoln 's private secretary and biographer ) once made a list of a dozen or more spurious quotations ? ? but the one he was most often @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And then with an introductory sentence that indicated the time of the utterance to be the close of the Civil ' War , Miss Nicolay quotes word for word what Senator Cutting used . Miss Nicolay says : " This alleged quotation seems to have made its first appearance in the Presidential campaign in 1888 , and it has returned with planetary regularity ever since . Although convinced by internal evidence of its falsity , my father made every effort to trace it to its source , but could find no responsible or respectable clue . " GEO . T. LEMMON . Chester , N.

To the Editor of The New York Times : Your editorial " A Solemn Warning " points out the danger to the country should the proposed loan to pay the veterans ' bonus at this time be adopted .

Jan. 30. 1931 Suggestion for the Red Cross To the Editor of The New York Times : If the Red Cross would broadcast an appeal requesting every person who had contempt for the Senate to send in $1 , the fund would be so oversubscribed that it would make the $25,000,000 the Senate is now talking about look like 30 cents . So many people would vote more than once that the " Sons of Wild Jackasses " would have years of investigating to do . Evilness would soon return to normal and the Red Cross would have done a double rood turn . JOHN B. TINNON . Larchmont , N. Y. , Jan. 30. 1931 . HOW THE DRAFT WAS MADE . Original Bill Was a Quick Job Without War College Aid . To the Editor of The New York Times : In a recent instalment of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ method of raising war armies by conscription was based on studies made by the War College under instruction from General Scott . " Some time in December , 1916 , the President requested the Secretary of War to prepare a bill authorizing the raising of an army of 500,000 men during the approaching recess of Congress . Twenty-four hours were allotted in which to make this draft . The task was allotted by the Seccee tary to General Crowder . The undersigned was then a Captain on the latter 's staff . The request camt vate in the afternoon and only four of:icers were available to do the work . General Crowder , therefore , allotted to those four the task of drafting various components of that bill . There were no studies of the War College or any other War Department bureau to guide . That evening after about five minutes ' consideration the undersigned drafted the first section of the selective service law of May 18 , 1917 , which in its essential words reads , viz. : " ? * * the President is hereby authorized ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ * an additional force of 500,000 enlisted men , " &c.; Political advisers prevailed on the President not to present this draft at that time , but on the declaration of war it was revised and while much of an administrative nature was added the revision was passed by Congress with no substantial change in the effective verbiage just recited . Also in March , 1917 , General Crowder requested the undersigned to prepare a memorandum outlining a method for executing such a draft as was provided for by the foregoing language of the law . In doing this  --  which was accomplished in less than a week  --  the undersigned neither saw nor was informed of any study by the War College or Ole general staff until close to the end of the preparation of the memorandum called for . In those days it was customary in : he office of the Judge Advocate General to prepare first what was called a " rough draft " ? double-spaced , foolscap , typewritten manuscript ? which , after correction , was recopied on letter-sized paper , single-spaced and prepared for the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no such final form was ever prepared . The original memorandum was submitted to the Secretary of War bearing General Crowder 's initials and a few unimportant penciled interlineations , some by General Crowder and some by the undersigned . Secretary Baker sent this back to our office marked " Approved " with his signature . In effect it proposed the plan on which the draft was finally executed , the es , entials of which were use of existing electoral machinery for registration , decentralization of the draft among State agencies , utter removal of the aspect of military administration from execution of the law and substitution of civilian agencies therefor , determination of exemptions by neighbors and acquaintances of registrants and the element of selection of the fittest rather than conscription of the unwilling . Now as to the general staff or War College memorandum which came to my attention about this time . It covered some 250 typewritten pages and my understanding is that it was rejected by Mr. Baker as being wholly unworkable and certainly unwieldy . It proposed registration by postmasters through a postcard system . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of registrants and determination of exemption claims knows the impracticability of this . Instead of using existing State agencies , it erected a complete new Federal administrative system paralleling or replacing State agencies somewhat on the pattern of the Civil War draft , which latter was about as complete a failure as anything our government ever attempted . About the only instruction I received from General Crowder in preparing the plan and erecting the mechanism of the 1917-1918 draft was to avoid every principal element of the Civil War system . The rest of the story is pretty well known history and the sole object of this letter is to demonstrate that the draft , like nearly every other logistical , organizational and administrative action of this country in the World War , was not the result of von Moltke-like preparation but was an improvisation begun either after war had been declared or had be-. come imminent . 1-1-TraTT R.
