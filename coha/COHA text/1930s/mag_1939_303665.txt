One day last week Wage-Hour Administrator Elmer Frank Andrews removed his bronze bust of Franklin Roosevelt , his handsome fountain-pen set , other personal belongings from Room 5144 in Washington 's Department of Labor Building . Just eight days short of a year since Federal wage-hour regulation began , gloomy , google-eyed Elmer Andrews had resigned by request . His letter of resignation was curtly addressed to " Mr. President . " Franklin Roosevelt replied to " Dear Elmer . " <P> Dear Elmer had had a hard row to hoe . When he took the job he was told to wait &; see how far industry would voluntarily comply with Wage-Hour regulations . That method worked astoundingly well . <P> But Mr. Andrews tripped himself on conflicting interpretations , had to be corrected by his embarrassed subordinates . Southern Congressmen , buttering up Mr. Andrews in Washington , privately advised their employer-constituents to pay no attention to the law . Employers who wanted to comply began to complain , along with Labor , that gentle Elmer Andrews was entirely too gentle . Elmer Andrews reasonably pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in Washington was quite inadequate to enforce a law covering 12,600,000 workers . Rebuffed by the White House , worn by a long fight to block crippling amendments at the last session of Congress , discouraged Mr. Andrews began to let matters slide . <P> Watching this situation with bright eyes was Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins , who did not like being left out of the picture . Distinctly hostile to her , Congress had twice refused to give Madam Perkins direct authority over the Labor Department 's semi-autonomous Wage-Hour Division . Administrator Andrews would brook no interference by Madam Secretary . Last week , as soon as he moved out , Frances Perkins moved in . <P> By White House order , Wage-Hour 's new administrator and trouble-shooter-tough , able Lieut. - Colonel Philip Fleming of the Army Engineers , whom Franklin Roosevelt selected for the job weeks ago ( TIME . Oct. 16 ) - was under her orders . <P> Because a Federal law dating back to 1870 forbids Army officers on active duty to hold civilian office , Madam Perkins had to appoint a dummy administrator , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to her . Chosen for this temporary front job was Wage-Hour 's white-maned , competent publicity man , Harold Duane Jacobs , a onetime Scripps-Howard editor who is capable of going to work in a green sports coat with orange stripes , pea-green vest , blue tie , grey shirt and grey flannels . <P> Out with Elmer Andrews went his playwriting Deputy Administrator Paul Sifton and an executive assistant , George McEwen . Summarily fired by Madam Perkins , without the usual two-week notice , was Elmer Andrews ' secretary and right-hand woman , handsome Eugenia Pope . Efficient , 33-year-old Miss Pope did much to make life bearable for her boss , fending off importunate callers and imposing order in an office not always noted for order . Miss Pope quickly got offers from other Federal bureaus and private business . Luckless Mr. Andrews , who gave up a $12,000-a-year job with New York State to take his $10,000 job in Washington , had nothing better in sight last week than a $7,500 place as labor-relations man for Reconstruction Finance Corp .        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
