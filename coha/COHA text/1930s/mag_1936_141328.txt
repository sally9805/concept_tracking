Last year Physiologist Howard Wilcox Haggard of Yale announced that onion or garlic breath " arises solely from particles retained in the structures of the mouth , " could be cured instantly by chloramine , a mouthwash containing chlorine ( TIME , July 1 , 1935 ) . Last week in the Journal of the American Medical Association two other investigators flatly contradicted Dr. Haggard with a report indicating that the only way to escape onion or garlic breath is to abstain from eating onions or garlic . <P> Professor Marion Arthur Blankenhorn and Dr. Calvus Elton Richards , both of Cincinnati 's General Hospital , were convinced that , when eaten , the essential oils of onion and garlic pass into the blood , are aerated into the lungs and from there breathed out . In proof , they offered the results of an experiment on a patient whose mouth was blocked off from his stomach by a cancer of the esophagus , who could receive nourishment only through a tube in the abdominal wall . Through this tube the experimenters introduced garlic soup . Three hours @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do so for twelve hours . In this case the pungent food was never in the mouth at all . <P> Another subject could eat normally , but his respiratory tract had been disconnected from his throat because of laryngeal cancer . This patient 's breath was inhaled and exhaled through a tube inserted in the windpipe . Three hours after he ate salad garnished with onion and garlic , the air exhaled through the tube became malodorous . In this instance the breath had no contact with the mouth , throat , esophagus or stomach , must therefore have picked up the contamination in the lungs . Unwilling to trust their own sense of smell entirely , Drs . Blankenhorn &; Richards called in technicians , hospital interns and residents who had no idea what the experiments were designed to prove . None of these observers had any difficulty identifying the subjects ' breaths as garlic-laden.
