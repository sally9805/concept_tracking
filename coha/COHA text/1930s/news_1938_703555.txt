txt Amid wars and rumors of wars it is with a sigh of relief that one turns to the picture of a happy utopia offered in America today by one of the great drives of our time : the proposal to give everybody over a specified age limit a government income that will banish debt , insure prosperity , and bring general all-round happiness to everybody . Those , at least . are the claims of some of the sponsors of the various current old-age pension projects , and so real has the hope of this verdant utopia become for countless hard pressed elderly people that it is having practical results in politics . The Social Credit Party , it will be remembered , continued for a brief period in Alberta under Prime Minister Aberhart ; in Colorado an extraordinary minimum of $45. a month old-age pension law was proposed for everybody over 60 in 1035 and was adopted by the electorate In 1836 to the surprise of nobody more than the plan 's own sponsors ; in the last session of Congress the Boileau modification of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over 60 , instead of Dr. Townsend 's original 5200 a month ) was said to have 102 House members behind it , and caused the administration no end of trouble ; in calltornta , Sheridan Downey has just beaten Senator for the Democratic re-nomination with an idyllic plan to give every unemployed person over 50 , " 530-every-Thursday " : while up in Maine all three Republican Congressmen were reelected Tuesday pledged to the Townsend plan , and with full Townsend club backing . Aug. 15 he positively called for its expansion . " What we are doing is good , " he said in his radio address , " but it is not good enough . " Social Security Act expansion is coming . But will that be enough ? A good many conservatives do not take the Townsendite and similar drives seriously ; but a good many people never thought America would have prohibition . There is a sincerity and idealism of purpose about some of the pension proponents that is actually reminiscent of old time dry leaders , and that can not be laughed off and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that two of the pension plans have actually been adopted . Everybody knows the Alberta experiment failed when merchants refused to take the gaudily engraved " prosperity certificates " with their stamp redemptions . Few people realize that in Colorado an- other pension plan is now in vogue , less spectacular than the Sheridan Downey scheme , but worth studying for all that . What Colorado Did It was eight days after the presidential election landslide of 1036 that this particular writer became aware of what Colorado had done , and wrote an article about it . The sparcely-settled , modestly-incomed state had Just voted itself one of the most liberal pension laws of our time ? in fact America 's most liberal law . Everybody over 60 was to get $45 a month , iegardless , or $590 a year , though the per capita earned income of the state was only $500 . Theoretically , at any rate , it gave a husband and wife over 60 , $1080 a year  --  cash . This was utopia unlimited . The rest of the world may not have noticed this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ happy interest of a discoverer . Colorado 's whole state budget was only $8,000,000 when the Constitutional amendment was passed , which provided a possible $13,000,000 expenditure alone  --  and it was indorsed by both parties . What has happened ? Well , Colorado voters will have a chance to repeal or modify the law this November . Opponents say it has nearly bankrupted the state . With a population around 1,000,000 , there are now 37,300 pensioners and funds from taxes set aside for the purpose are so low that full payment of $45 has not been possible for seven months , and last payment was only $25.75 . It seems to be one more case of idealistic generosity modified by experience ; the tire of utopia punctured by the nail of reality . ' Jobless Aid to All Urged Special to The Christian Science Monitor ATLANTIC CITY , N. J. , Sept. 15 ? The New Jersey State Federation of Labor will ask the next Legislature to extend the State 's unemployment compensation law to all workers , including agricultural workers and house servants , it was announced hero @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Federal Social Security law . Evident Elsewhere The same Townsend Republican alliance is evident in New Hampshire , and in other spots . If anyone can look at all this and not see the common pattern of a yearning for security manifesting itself in mass emotion all over the country he must be politically obtuse . Almost certainly it will force the New Deal to liberalize the Social Security Act , as one attempt to avert even more drastic action . Last April Mr. Roosevelt asked the Security Board for a study of methods for liberalization , and on
