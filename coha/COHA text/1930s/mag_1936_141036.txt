Biggest single publishing award open to aspiring authors is the fat old Atlantic Monthly 's annual $10,000 prize . First and most famed beneficiary was Canada 's Mazo de la Roche , whose Jalna won in 1927 . Last week another woman writer was similarly enriched when Mrs. Winifred Mayne Van Etten , 34 , of Mt . Vernon , Iowa , received the 1936 Atlantic prize for a novel called I Am the Fox , which the Atlantic Monthly Press will issue in August . <P> Like many another U. S. literary prizewinner , slender little Mrs. Van Etten had done no previous professional writing , turned out a regional story as her first big job . After winning an M.A. at Columbia in 1928 , Mrs. Van Etten returned to Mt . Vernon to teach at Cornell College , where she had been graduated three years before , learned about her native State by helping a county nurse make a survey of rural bathing habits . She began I Am the Fox after arguing with her husband about whether foxes object to being hunted , finished @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Cornell 's Professor Clyde Tull , who knew Mrs. Van Etten could write because he had taught her how . <P> When told she had won , Mrs. Van Etten jiggled the cigaret lighter on her car , burned her thumb . Planning to save part of the $10,000 , she remarked , " I do n't suppose it would be possible to repeat right away on a thing like this , " went to work on a second novel .
