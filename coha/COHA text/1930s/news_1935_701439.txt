txt One of the most stubborn myths of the depression era has been the belief that a depreciated currency is a great stimulus to exports . By lowering the value of a currency in terms of other currencies the prices of exported goods are made cheaper , while those of imported products become correspondingly dearer . The twofold effect , therefore , must be to discourage imports and facilitate exports . This belief , however , does not stand up under a statistical test , either in terms of export-import ratios or in terms of total value of exports . In 1934 , for example , the British pound was depreciated an average of 38 per cent , while the French franc was still at par . Yet British exports in 1934 were equal in value to only 61 per cent of her imports , as compared with 63 per cent in 1930 , while French exports in 1934 were equal in value to 77 per cent of her imports , as compared to 81 per cent in 1930 . The same sort of result is obtained when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not appear to be true at first glance , but that is largely because any individual country 's export values are usually quoted in terms of its own depreciated currency . In a study of currency stabilization just published by the Foreign Policy Association a table is presented giving an index of exports of twelve leading countries in 1934 in terms of the percentage of these exports to those of the same countries in 1929 . This is presented in the first column below . The export values of each country , however , are measured in the currency of that country . It is interesting to set down in a second column the average depreciation of these currencies in 1934 ( as calculated in the League of Nations statistical bulletins ) and on the basis of that depreciation to calculate a rough index of the gold value of the 1934 exports of these countries , in percentages of 1929 values , and present them in a third column .

The first six countries had heavily depreciated currencies ; the other six either remained on gold or maintained their exchange rate at approximate parity . In terms of currency values the six gold or parity countries showed average exports in 1934 of only 35.3 per cent of those in 1929 , while the six depreciated currency countries showed average exports of 66.6 per cent of those in 1929 . But when the exports of the depreciated currency countries are also expressed in gold values , they , too , by a rather remarkable coincidence , turn out to be just 35.3 per cent of those of 1929 ? exactly the same average as those of the countries whose currencies were not depreciated.                 @ @ @ @
