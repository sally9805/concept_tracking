A neat anomaly was to be found last week in the statistics of 1939 's war boom . In October the Federal Reserve production index reached 120 , past its 1937 peak of 118 . Yet October employment ( up 1,250,000 from 1938 , according to Madam Secretary Perkins ) was down by more than 1,000,000 men from 1937 's peak . <P> In part this contrast may be due to screwy statistics ( the production index is heavily weighted by certain industries ) , but in large part it represents technological improvements . For if improved machinery increases output per man , it is perfectly possible to have bigger production and bigger unemployment at the same time . Two examples of this can be found in two of the U. S. 's biggest employers : motors and steel . In 1937 motormakers bought connecting rod grinders that stepped up production from 250 to 850 units an hour , a machine for bending window-finish strips by which a five-man team producing 50 strips per hour was replaced by one man bending 120 strips . To make the wide @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ etc. , steelmakers came up in 1926 with the continuous strip rolling mill . Costing as high as $20,000,000 , operated by as few as 2,000 men , it threw out team upon team of hand mill men who used to flip the steel sheets from one roller to the next . <P> An equally neat anomaly was to be found between 1939 and 1929 's production and employment figures . At 120 the production index virtually duplicated 1929 's peak ( 126 ) , but 1939 's unemployment is around 9,000,000 . This is largely due to the fact that some 500,000 new workers come into the labor market each year : October 's nonagricultural employment ( 34,649,000 ) was only 1,492,000 under 1929 . For with a growing working population it would be perfectly possible to have employment and unemployment increase at the same time .
