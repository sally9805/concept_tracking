Six years ago spectacled Laurence Greene , Baltimore Sun copyreader , began rummaging about in old U. S. newspaper files . His object : to assemble " the sort of scrapbook an inveterate reader of newspapers who lived in three centuries might have compiled . " In burrowing his way from 1690 , when the first U. S. newspaper was published , to the War , Laurence Greene 's greatest difficulty was to stick to the red-letter historical events , avoid the temptation to wander down fascinating journalistic bypaths . Last week Laurence Greene 's historical newspaper scrapbook , America Goes to Press* was published . Of his collection of such classic U. S. front-page stones as the Battle of Trenton , Lee 's Surrender at Appomattox , the Chicago Fire , the Custer Massacre , Author Greene explains : " Ours is a bloody history , and blood often makes the best Extras . " <P> First really big story for Colonial editors was the repeal of the Stamp Act , which they considered a punitive tax and a fetter to a free press . Still in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , 1773 boldly addressed its readers with a call to arms against the British . " FRIENDS ! BRETHREN ! COUNTRYMEN ! " shouted the News-Letter 's , front page . " That worst of plagues , the detested TEA , shipped for this Port by the East-India Company , is now arrived in this Harbour ; the Hour of Destruction or manly Opposition to the Machinations of Tyranny stares you in the Face . . . . " <P> Citizens of Boston soon tossed the " detested T E A " into Boston Harbor , thus enabling the News-Letter to report that " a number of brave and resolute men dressed in the Indian manner ... in the space of three Hours . . . broke up 342 Chests . " <P> Three years later , when the Declaration of Independence was signed , the Philadelphia Pennsylvania Gazette recorded the fact with the unemotional curtness of a modern press association " flash . " " On Monday last , at twelve o'clock , the Declaration of Independence was proclaimed at the state house in this city , " announced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ presence of many thousand spectators , who testified their approbation by repeated acclamations . " <P> Early U. S. journalism was not always so phlegmatic . When the end of the Revolution came with the downfall of Cornwallis , the editor of the Philadelphia Freemen 's Journal or the North American Intelligencer printed the news in type four times normal size . " BE IT REMEMBERED ! " thundered the Freemen 's Journal , " that on the 17th day of October , 1781 Lieut . Gen. Charles Earl Cornwallis , with above 5,000 British troops , surrendered themselves prisoners of war to His Excellency , Gen. GEORGE WASHINGTON , Commander-in-Chief of the allied forces of France and America . LAUS DEO ! " <P> Greatest of Federalist scandals was the killing , in a duel , of Alexander Hamilton by his bitter political opponent , Aaron Burr . The New York Chronicle of July 13 , 1804 described the fatal affair with impressive simplicity : " They then proceeded to load the pistols . . . . The gentleman who was to give the word then explained to the parties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and fired . . . . The fire of Col. Burr took effect . "
