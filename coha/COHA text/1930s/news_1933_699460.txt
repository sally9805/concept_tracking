txt The most important feature of Mr. Neville Chain ! berlain 's statement upon war debts at Leeds last night is seen here in I the finality it insists upon as an essential condition of any agree . ment " Two things , " the Chancellor of the Exchequer said , " seem to us essential -- one , that any settlement to be reached must be a final settlement and , two . that it must be one which will not involve any resumption of a claim on Germany for reparations " The capital sun/ which would be paid to the United States under the scheme that Mr Chamberlam has in view , in the general opinion here , would have been raised by the flotation of a British Gores nment loan in the United States The Financial News today estimated toe maximum amount of such a loan at present , at ? 100,000 , - 000 and this figure depends upon condition ; which are changing rapidly . At the present moment sterling is rising strongly . It has gone up from a low level of 3.14 at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have risen higher but for heavy dollar purl chases made by the Bank r I England in an endeavor to peg it at , that point This rise has been mainly speculative , although seasonal demands for trade of a temporary nature also have been a factor . Whether it will be maintained depends largely upon inflationary movements which are almost as active here as in the United States The London Times today advoHates cautious British advance in this direction in the interests of ' further ' estoration of commodity in ices . There is little doubt , the Times says , that Britain would approve , and other nations have understood , " some departure from conventional methods of preparing and presenting national accounts , if such a course were necessary to relieve trade , industry and taxpayers from intolerable burdens . " The method the Times suggests is seduction of taxation for one year to the extent of the greater budget estimates , but this once adopted might be difficult to control . There is force , therefore , in the contention put forward by Mr. A. Allan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an , nual meeting of that institution I yestei day , when he said that one of ' the dangers in the negotiations about to commence is that they may direct attention chiefly to " such fruitless discussions as the advantages or disadvantages of the use of gold as standard " instead of concentrating upon restoring of markets , purchasing power and credits . Since ! the international problem of freeing I trade was solved , Mr. Paton adds , purely monetary questions would show themselves susceptible of treatment . On the other hand , the Daily Telegraph says today , that to attempt any unilateral expansion of markets for American exports would only intensify the present difficulties by tending to make six-cent cotton and 40-cent wheat permanent facto/8% in the situation Chamberlain Urges Debt Solution That Leaves Lausanne Accord Intact LEEDS . Eng , Jan 25 UM  --  The following is the text of the speech of Mr. Neville Chamberlain , British Chancellor of the Exchequer , yesterday on the war debt question ? We have in the last few days received a message from the United States of America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the settlement of one of our most pressing difficulties . It would be too much to say that reparations and war debts have been the sole cause of the economic crisis ; but there can be little doubt that until the nightmare of these intergovernmental obligations has been laid to rest we can not hope that confidence among the nations will be restored or that we can compass that financial and economic recovery which has been so long delayed Last June we accomplished at Lausanne a provisional settlement of reparations . It could only be provisional because , whatever theories may be entertained about the relation between reparations and war debts , Germany 's creditors could not be expected finally to release their claims until they were assured of similar treatment as regards their own obligations . I had hoped that we might have been spared the dilemma in which we were placed last December when we had to choose between default upon our legal obligations and payment which , as we believed , could only accentuate further the troubles and difficulties which beset the world and not the least @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ upon the Amei lean refusal to prolong the moratoi ium whilst conversations were taking place . I realize the difficulties of the American Government and , remembering how long it took to persuade the European nations of the evil results of reparations , -I can well understand how different is the aspect which the subject of war debts pi esents to the farmer of the middle West from that which appears to us . But there are certain fundamental truths which will out even though they may lie concealed for a time . In the long run all payments to a foreign country must take the form of sending goods or of rendering services . It may well be that this truth has been hidden from the American farmer by transactions which he has perhaps not observed . During the 10 years 1922 to 1931 the United States of America received from foreign countries ? 400,000,000 ( $1,340,000,000 ) in war debts , ? 1,000,000,000 in net interest on commercial loans , and ? 1. - 200,000,000 for surplus of American goods sold abroad over foreign goods sold to her . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Flow did foreigners pay that vast sum ? , A billion five hundred million sterling came from the expenditure by American tourists in European countries and remittances from immigrants living in America to their foreign relatives . Another ? 100,000,000 came by shipments of gold , making ? 1,600,000,100 altogether . U. S. Stops Lending Money Where did the remaining ? 1 , - 000,000,000 come from ? It came from loans made by America to the rest of the world and it was that ? 1,000,000,000 of loans and that alone which made possible ' , he payment of ? 400,000,000 of war iebts But at the present time Ameri:an tourist expenditure has swindled to a very low figure ; so save remittances from Immigrants in America . She has already got more gold than she knows what to do with and she has stopped lending money , Therefore if these war debts payments were to be resumed they could not be made by loans or by further shipments of gold Effective means of payment would have to be found and they could only be found by increasing sales of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same thing , by diminishing purchases from America , Increased sales might be effected by drastic reduction of the American tariff or , in the case of count ! les off the gold standard , by a depreciation of their currencies in terms of gold . Decreased purchases could be insured either by depreciating currency or by increasing the tariff against America . Now , in pointing out what would be the effect of resuming war debt payments , I am not using threats , If you see a man walking along a precipice and you point out to him that the ground just in front of him is undermined , that is not ' a threat , it is a warning , and it is not less friendly because it is evident that if the man goes over the precipice he is quite likely to drag you down with him . America Depends on Markets As a matter of fact , these considerations which I have been mentioning and the consequences arising from them are very well realized in many quarters of America already . America depends to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She herself consumes only 80 per cent of her own wheat , only 64 per cent of her copper , only 60 per cent of her tobacco and only 45 per cent of her cotton . For the rest she must find a market outside her own boundaries and unless she can find that market at a remunerative price her producers a/ e bound to suffer . Only a short time ago a number of cotton exchanges in America passed a long resolution which says among other things ' " From foreign buyers of cotton and wheat it is clear that 6-cent cotton and 40-cent wheat are inevitable so long as international commercial and financial relations remain as they are . Members of this exchange give solemn warning to southern farmers and their representatives at Washington that unless this critical situation is promptly faced the growing of cotton and wheat for export has perished as a means of decent livelihood in this country . We urge every farmer to demand that the Government confer at once with foreign debtors with a view to finding a rearrangement of debts that can in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power on which the survival of our farmers depends . " That resolution shows , I think , that there is at any rate an important and enlightened section of opinion in the United States which is not so far from our own point of view . Our point of view is well known , for it has been consistently held by successive governments since the war . We believe that the total cancellation of war debts and reparations would be the best thing that could happen to the world as a whole , but if that is going further than American opinion is yet prepared to accept , we shall gladly discuss with our American friends whenever they are ready to receive our representative the lines on which an agreement can be leached , bearing in mind two things which seem to us essential : First , that the settlement to be reached must be the final settlement , and , secondly , that it must be one which will not involve resumption of the claim on Germany for reparations which it was the object Of the Lausanne settlement last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one substantial advance during the last few years in the troubled history of Europe . Not only did it put an end to the uncertainty and anxiety which attended all previous efforts to adjust an impossible situation , but it also opened up new possibilities of a friendlier feeling between European nations on which might be based more fruitful cooperation in other spheres To disturb that settlement now would be to reopen old wounds and to destroy for an indefinite period all prospect of agreement on matters affecting the happiness and prosperity not merely of Europe but of the whole world . America Must Export , Chamberlain Affirms ALTHOUGH , according to Department of Commerce figures , the United States only exports normally about 10 per cent of what it produces , Mr. Neville Chamberlain , British Chancellor of the Exchequer , was able to show in his debt speech yesterday that America is nevertheless largely dependent upon its export trade . He mentions the following statistics : America consumes only 80 per cent of its own wheat It consumes only 64 per cent of its copper . It consumes only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 45 per cent of its cotton . No Reservations Made in London 's Notice of Acceptance ISSUE AGAIN RAISED ON GOLD STANDARD High Administration Edict Declares British Return Is Vital to America Special Irorn Monitor Bureau WASHINGTON , Jan. 25 ? The British note accepting President-Elect Roosevelt 's invitation to war debts discussions early in March was received at the State Department today . It is without reservations . Whatever alterations in procedure British policy may favor are not set forth The line is taken that when discussions begin it will be ample time to explain any different methods which London may prefer . The delay of a week-end and two days since the invitation was issued is not taken seriously in responsible circles here . British officials , it is felt , naturally had to take time to consider so serious a step Any hint that the Briteth delay w as due to an attempt to secure an invitation for France and the other defaulting powers is dispelled by today 's acceptance . If any explanation of the time interval is needed it is to be found in Bi itish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ communiqu ? of last Friday stipulates . If such discussions are to concentrate upon an effort to bring Britain back to the gold standard prematurely , or against its will , in exchange for debts revision , then it apparently was felt that such tal:zs would be harmful rather than helpful . Gold Club is Swung In this connection a renewed attempt at bringing the gold standard into the negotiations was noted in Washington today with mixed feelings , w hen the Hoover Administration was injected into the controversy , despite assurances that all policy-making negotiations would henceforth be left to President-Elect Roosevelt . An authority high in the Administration emphatically stressed the mem tance to the United States of the stabilization of depreciated foreign currencies . Whatever the incoming Administration may Teel  --  and there had been hints that holding return to gold like a sword of Damocles over Great Britain 's head was not regarded as wise diplomacy  --  it is evident that the White House is intensively preoccupied with the question of pegging foreign monies back on their gold basis . Today 's statement was clearly intended to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was an open warning to Great Britain that in the view of the outgoing Administration , its return to a fixed currency , naturally to be followed by sterling 's associated currencies , is regarded as the prime world economic need of the hour . Likewise the statement is regarded as an attempt to convince the American people that their diplomacy must seek above all to smile stabilization of foreign currencies . It is evidently thought that if sufficient public support can be enlisted to this view , the incoming Administration will be forced to adopt the policy of bringing foreign currencies back to gold . Latvia and Finland Invited While this venture in publictatement seized the Administration spotlight . Mr. Henry L. Stinson , acting broadly as interim Secretary of State for President-Elect Roosevelt , continued to expand the bases of the coming negotiations In response to queries from their diplomatic representatives , and on instructions from President-Elect Roosevelt , he invited Latvia and Finland , the two remaining debtor states who paid on Dec. 15 , to participate in the March discussions . Like Great Britain they have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first is to concern debts , the second general economic problems  --  in all probability stable currencies and possibly tariffs . At the White House the strongest possible stress was laid upon the need for bringing about a speedy return to gold . President Hoover believes that the only alternative to stabilized currencies will be higher and ever higher American tariffs . But the United States , went on the authority , " should not join in the same mad race which has brought about constantly depreciating prices and trade stagnation in Europe in the last two years . " Yet , one or another of the alternatives must be chosen , it was warned . For depreciating currencies " are very definitely producing considerable unemployment and damage to agriculture in the United States . " The real remedy , return to gold , it was said , " would stabilize prices and bring immediate relief to the United States . If it could be announced tomorrow that the chief nations were to return to gold , prices would rise immediately . "         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
