Because it is largely responsible for the safety of vessels at sea , the U. S. Bureau of Navigation &; Steamboat Inspection has had to take its share of blame for the Morro Castle disaster. * Notably concerned by the Bureau 's apparent inefficiency was President Roosevelt . Last week , as the first step in its reorganization , he drafted a famed seaman to take what the Bureau 's Director Joseph B. Weaver called " the most important job of its kind in the world . " The job : supervising inspector of the Bureau 's 2nd District ( New York , Philadelphia , Albany , New Haven ) . The man : Captain George Fried of the S. S. Washington . <P> Best-known shipmaster in the U. S. Merchant Marine , Captain Fried , at 57 , is famed for his ocean rescues-25 men from the British freighter Antinoe in 1926 , 32 men from the Italian freighter Florida in 1929 . Month ago , as skipper of the S. S. Washington , he sent out a lifeboat to pick up the survivors of a cinema-chartered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to take off newsreels of King Alexander 's assassination ( TIME , Oct. 22 ) . For that rescue Captain Fried , standing last week for the last time in the shadow of the Washington 's funnels , received his company 's distinguished service gold medal from Vice President P. V. G. Mitchell . <P> In resigning from the U. S. Lines to take a job ashore , Captain Fried will have to take a salary cut . In his new position he will , among other things , be responsible for the physical inspection of all U. S. vessels in his district , the inspection and examination of all life-saving equipment , licensed officers , able seamen and lifeboat men . On his nights ashore he loves to sit for hours at a window smoking his pipe and watching traffic . His wife , whom he met when she was a guest at the captain 's table , does not permit him to drive in it . It makes him too nervous . <P> * Last week the charred Ward Liner , still stuck on the beach off Asbury Park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 134 when the assistant wrecking master of the salvage crew fell to his death down an open hatchway.
