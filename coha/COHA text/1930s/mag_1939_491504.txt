: VI ODERN cynics have amplified Madame De Coroners well-known quotation that no man is a hero to his valet to include secretaries . The movies have led people to believe that all secretaries work for titans of finance , handsome romantic fellows , usually married , but seldom understood by their wives . Hollywood depicts these economic royalists as great human dynamos of energy and efficiency whose words are law . Their hearts , however , are always pure gold . Judging from the plentiful plaints of secretaries , the picture presented is not true . Winnie the Breadwinner 's Utopia has not arrived . The majority of modern offices are not the efficient , happy places they should be in this machine age . These laments of the secretaries force one to conclude that most employers are not heroes to their amanuenses . A man 's unpopularity outside of office hours may be due to any number of reasons , but if he is unpopular with the stenographers , it is probably due to the fact that he is a poor dictator , and not to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ belief that they are good dictators , but this is an illusion in the majority of cases . Good dictators are few and far between . There are , however , a few cardinal principles which , if observed , should greatly increase the number . If the girls are always busy when you call for someone to whom to dictate , you 'd better heed the following advice . If you have difficulty in thinking out loud in a comprehensive manner , it 's a good idea to make notes and dictate from them . No stenographer should have to sit hour after hour while you fumble and grope for three-letter words , and finally succeed in finishing a two-paragraph letter the meaning of which is not clear even to yourself . Imagine yourself compelled to sit for hours in the same chair , until your feet go to sleep , your muscles ache and you are bored to the point of distraction , while someone paces the floor , manages to bring forth a sentence , glances out the door and decides to crass the sentence out ; makes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four more words ; sits down and lights his pipe and draws on it for five or ten minutes ; then makes another mighty effort , and brings out a complete sentence without a pause . The strain from this mental effort requires a look out the window . The view is its own reward and nothing tomes of it . However , five minutes of doodling inspire a short paragraph , and the dictator , with renewed hope , wants it all road back to him , as he has by this time lost the thread of what be has dictated  --  dictators of this type are always " losing the thread . " And so , far into the clay . Mr. Kelley is one of those men who are fond of having dictation rend back to them . One day he said to Miss Judd , his secretary ; " Read that sentence back to me . " Miss Judd replied , " I do n't believe what you have dictated makes a complete sentence , Mr. Kelley . " " Does n't make a sentence ? Well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Wait until you are ready actually to begin dictating before you attempt to have someone else put your ideas down on paper . You will save not only your time and that of your secretary but your dignity as well . Gather all the necessary correspondence , reference books , et cetera , together and make your notes before you call in your stenographer . And when you have finished , turn over all pertinent papers to her , so that she can check proper names , figures , addresses , and so on . Try to do as much of your dictating as possible at one sitting , instead of calling in a girl every hour or so for a short session . By this method you can accomplish much more in a day . An understanding of some of the principles of shorthand might help in mastering the finer points of dictation . Proper names can not be written satisfactorily in shorthand , but must be written out , which takes time . All proper names not familiar to your stenographer should be spelled out , unless the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ words should never be spelled out unless they are so unusual they can not be found in an ordinary dictionary . Habitual spellers almost invariably spell the easy words and pass quickly by the hard ones , so it is very little help in any event . The spelling of words is an interruption to what should be an even flow of thought and words , and should not be resorted to unless your stenographer is a hopelessly bad speller . And even if she is , she 'll improve faster by using the dictionary and by having to correct improperly spelled words than she will by having yon spell words for her . Punctuation should not be dictated , unless from a direct quotation . This , too , is a constant interruption to the train of thought of both dictator and stenographer ; and if your stenographer is not capable of punctuating , she is probably not capable of transcribing material satisfactorily . If you feel very strongly on such a fine point as whether a period goes inside or outside of a quotation mark , instruct your secretary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave such decisions to her discretion and knowledge . A good office manual will settle all such highly controversial matters , and no office should be without one . Dear Mr. Tyler Colon Paragraph A LONG quotation should not be dictated , but should be copied from the original . Copying from the original not only saves time but is the one method which insures accuracy . A good stenographer does not merely take down words , she follows the thought of the dictation and punctuates more or less mechanically as she goes along . Knowing how the mind of a stenographer operates when she is taking notes , you can readily see how difficult you make it for her when you use the technique employed in the following paragraph : " Take a letter to Mr. Tyler . . . . Dear Mr. Tyler colon paragraph I was very much gratified comma as well as surprised comma to learn of the e-f-f-e-e-t upon last month apostrophe a sales of our new advertising slogan s-l-o-g-a-n vole Norton 's Nuts for Nutrition unquote period paragraph , " et cetera . Read that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No ? Well , it does n't make sense to your stenographer either . Do you recall Sinclair Lewis ' Bab-ft bitt on the subject of his secretary , Miss MeGoun , who had succeeded in making a finished letter out of his jumble of words , phrases , punctuation and side remarks ? Babbitt comments : " Now , what the I never told MeGoun to make a third paragraph there ! Wish she 'd quit trying to improve on my dictation . " Fortunately for the Babbitts of business , their Miss MeGouns frequently take it upon themselves to improve on their bosses ' dictation . Like Babbitt , they fail to realize how much polishing has been done and how much their dictation needs the sandpaper touch of their secretaries . It is hard to take dictation from someone who jerks constantly or hesitates at the wrong places . Probably the most important point in this connection is that a stenographer can transcribe notes the general substance of which she has absorbed during the dictation with far greater speed and accuracy than she can transcribe notes taken @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but cigars and pipes are an impediment to good diction , so if you like to smoke while dictating , do n't be out of patience with your secretary if she writes that you admire your customer 's " leanness " when in reality it is his " genius " you had in mind . It is , of course , a different story if she describes the boundaries of a piece of land as running by leaps and bounds instead of by the customary metes and hounds . Further on the subject of cigars , if your wife refuses to allow you to smoke the two-for-a-nickel variety at . home , the chances are your secretary 's nose is just as discriminating . An upright , straight-tothe-front position is recommended when dictating . If you want to he heard correctly , do n't hide your head in your arms , hold your hands over your mouth , or lean too far out . rapher can give her employer is that he is " a good dictator . " All in all , these Bryans of the business world really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and if you are a poor dictator , you would do well to emulate them . It 's not done with mirrors , good dictators can he made as well as born , and mastery of the art or dictation will make an office hero out of even the most unpromising material . Every office has at least one scapegoat , and usually two  --  the file clerk and the telephone operator . While office scapegoats may not often be driven into the wilderness , as was the fate of scapegoats among the ancient Jews , they must . frequently be tempted to go there of their own accord . Nothing is too mean or low to blame on the files . Businessmen seem to believe files are invested with human capacities for evil , capable of slyly removing papers when they are most needed , or wantonly destroying them altogether . Far from being a place of safekeeping in their eyes , they hold out to the last ditch against entrusting anything of any value to such a perilous and diabolical depository- . This holdout. system is common to many @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to keep all the papers instead of turning them over to the files . It eventually becomes a sort of game between the actual possessor and the one charged with possession , and takes great cunningness and ingenuity on the part of the latter to bring the papers to their final resting place . Some information is necessary to locate papers that have been filed . In Mr. Drake 's office , in Boston . miscellaneous correspondence is filed alphabetically . One clay a friend of his in Hartford called him on the telephone requesting him to interview a Mr. Hornberger , of New York , about a job . Mr. Drake agreed and wrote Mr. Hornberger , saying he would be glad to see him . Three weeks passed and uo word from the gentleman in New York . Daughters of Sherlock Holmes A /FR . DRAKE called in his secretary . " We have n't heard from that man Mr. Wallace called me about , have we ? " " No , there has been no reply . " " Well , get me the copy of the letter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's name ? " " I have n't any idea what his name is . What difference does it make ? " " It will be difficult to locate the letter without the man 's name , as it is filed alphabetically . " " Do yen mean to tell me there is a paper in the files you ca n't find ? " You can see from this incident that detective ability is an asset to a filo clerk and that clues are often meager in the extreme . ( Contirmod on Pare 481 place . So that I was completely surprised , wandering off by myself for a walk on the broken ground beyond the ridge , when she appeared before me suddenly from behind a rock , her eyes bright in a face set like granite , " You must come with me , " she whispered . " That . boy is here . I knew he stole the clothing . I 'm not going to let him get away with it . Hurry . " Her boot heels scraped briskly on the rocks as 1 slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the brown oak branches shut us in on the hilly path out of sight of everything . It was hard to keep up with her . The faint path markings looped among boulders up another slope that seemed endless . Roots and fallen branches tripped me up . Once or twice she stopped and waited for me , listening . It did seem to me that someone was moving cautiously up ahead . We followed the slight sounds for what seemed like a long hidden way . Sometimes when we stopped among dark tree trunks , I thought . I heard sounds behind us also . But there were people living in strange places in these hills , and men went about gathering the last of the leaves for the goats . I did hope we were n't lost . But she went . grimly ahead on what seemed to me the most futile of pursuits . And once I saw clearly the boy Bill , his hair wilder than ever , his khaki already toni , looking back like something hunted from a rocky ridge . It seemed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But there was presently a sort of clearing among the wooded stones , and a but in it . The sunlight . was streaked with blue smoke from a fire , and a wild-eyed goat plunged away from us on a tether . The chief nurse strode over to the low door , stooped and went in , and of course I followed her . Bill was there , beyond the fire , and a man like a scarecrow stood up suddenly to face us . His hand was on the silver-hilted pistol in his belt and his eyes flared . The curious trousers he wore were Red Cross hospital pajamas , and the other bundles of clothing lay by the wall . Whatever I thought of her zeal , there was no question of her courage . The man looked , to me , ravaged and ill and desperate , but his eyes were held by the stony calm of her face . " Stolen , as I thought , " she said . " You ca n't trust any of them . " The man 's look wavered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ need them badly , " I said . " After all , we were giving them away . " " I wo n't have it. , " she said , and walked around and picked up the bundles . " They do n't deserve our good things . " She walked out the door with them , and the man started forward with a torrent of strange words . Out in the clearing , the Serbian soldier from Kolashin stood watching us , grinning , with his long rifle steady . Edith Chandler went . by him as if he did not exist . He let her pass and waved me out of the way . It did not once occur to me he would shoot . The crack of his rifle deafened me as I jumped back and turned . The tall man in the doorway slowly let go the hilt of his revolver and slowly twisted on his heel , clutching his chest as he fell . I think I cried " Do n't , do n't ! " as the soldier leveled his rifle again at the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ran toward them . But he did not shoot . again . Bright blood was shocking on the curled oak leaves , and the boy pawed the man 's shoulder with strangled , whimpering noises as the soldier walked near . Edith Chandler stood staring hack at us from the center of the clearing , with the most extraordinary , unbelieving shock in her face . " Do n't stand there like that ! " I said to her furiously . " He 's dying  --  for a bundle of old clothes ! Do some-thing ! " She came on automatically , dropping the bundles and staring , not at the man or the blood , but at the boy 's agonized face . Her own went curiously to pieces . I ca n't explain it any other way . The village , for the next hours , boiled with excitement . I had come back with the soldier for the stretcher , as she ordered me , and after dark the lights were still on in the operating room of the hospital , where Miss Chandler was helping Doctor Reynolds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ elated . It seemed the man was the most dangerous of the bandits , and the boy who had stolen the clothing for him and trudged up all this way was his son . Now , he told me , perhaps the government would have peace . But the dark faces of the mountain people , hovering and staring from the doorways , seemed shut against us . I was sure that many of these rangy , tattered men had been konthaji themselves . Perhaps this was not the best way for the new government to make peace . But I was certain of one thing  --  that it would be much better for everyone here if the Americans , who were the cause of his capture , were able to keep him alive . It would be difficult , I understood . The bullet lay perilously near the heart .. It was full dark before the lamps in the operating room went out . The Serbian gentleman and Henry Gerrish and I ate our dinner by the fire , very silent , and the nurses ' aids came over , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back . He said , " If nursing can help now , he 'll live . The woman 's a wonder . " Afterward I went out to walk up and down in the starlit dark , and Henry Gerrish sometimes walked with me , his face a torment . He went dashing off into the dark , time and again , by himself , and I ignored him , knowing that he was hovering by the hospital door . There were low lights in many of the houses , and a mutter of men 's voices , and far out among the dark mountains the crack of a rifle , and silence and another crack . I could n't stay within . I would n't have eavesdropped for the world , but there I was , caught suddenly in the shadows as she opened the lighted hospital door . Henry stood full in the path with the light on him , and I heard the little choked cry she gave . " You 're Henry ? " she said . " That boy . Henry Marsden . I remembered it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  his poor , frightened face . I did that to you all those years ago , that dreadful thing . I might have known you did n't take the money , but I was ashamed because you were the grocery boy and I  --  liked you . You changed your name . Those glasses ? I would n't have known  --  except maybe I did know  --  how you must have hated me all these years , " He said , very simply , " I 've never stopped thinking about you , Edith . Yes , I thought I hated you , but ? " She must have been weak with exhaustion and shock and emotion . I saw her stumble a little and his hand go out to her . They stood staring at each other with the starlight pouring over them . He had her hand in both of his , with a gesture so kind , so tender that a tightness came in my own throat . That 's a good man , I remember thinking . Thal is a man really good . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ humbly . " I thought it was because I hated you that I had to prove to you that you were wrong . But it was n't that . I 've always thought about you . Sometimes I thought that maybe you had worried , so I wanted to tell you it was the best thing in the world for me . I want you to be sure of that . It is all right . " " I 've been a bad woman , " she said pitifully . " Harsh and unjust and proud . I tried not to think of it . But I was wrong about that boy you were kind to , just as I was wrong about . you . I do n't know what to do now ! Oh , I do n't know what to do ! " " Hush , " he said , " hush , do n't cry like that , Edith . I 'm going to see that you will never feel bad any more . I 'm going to take care of you , just as if nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other . " " Loving ? " I saw the blank astonishment on her quivering mouth . " Loving . Henry ? " " What else ? " he said . " Hush now . You must have your supper and some sleep . Will the man live ? " " Yes , " she said , with a break in her voice like a long sigh . " Yes . " They walked on slowly together toward the house as I stood fixed in the shadows . I did not go in myself for a while , because I thought they would want the fire to themselves , and it was fine out in the windy dark where the rifle shots had ceased to echo among the mountains . HOW YO BE A ZENO Ire YOUR OZCLITETARY ( Continued from Page 21 ) In many instances the filing system is to blame , for too many offices use the biblical , or seek-and-eventually-find , system , which is not conducive to efficiency or good tempers . You should see that a system of tiling which suits your particular line of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the filing , and then co-operate with that person to see that she is given an opportunity to record and eventually to file all papers . If you will do these things and refrain from blaming everything that goes wrong on the files , you will have gone a long way toward removing any temptations the wilderness may hold for your file clerk . Another office scapegoat is the telephone operator , who , in a great many offices , also acts as receptionist , typist or secretary  --  sometimes all four . It may be that association of the operator with the telephone itself makes men impatient with their telephone operators , as a telephone , particularly the dial variety , seems to infuriate people more than any other mechanism . Patience is a virtue which should he cultivated if one has to talk on the telephone . Mr. Smith 's telephone oper ator naturally thinks that the man she works for is busier and more important than Mr. Jones , whose operator is trying to reach Mr. Smith on the telephone , and Mr. Smith 's operator wants Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ keep him there until Mr. Smith is ready to talk . Operators invariably say , " Put your man on ; my man is ready . " He rarely is ready ; but when you are calling someone you might as well be patient , because the odds are that the other operator wo n't put her party on until she knows you are ready and waiting . You 'll just have to make up this lost time when someone calls you . A good telephone operator receptionist is about the best co-ordinator an office can have . She knows enough to interrupt the bridge game at the club and bring you in a hurry if the executive vice-president wants to see you at three o'clock and you have not returned from lunch . She does as much for the executive V. P. when the president wants to see him. , and so on up and down the line . She has probably got everyone in the office out of a hole at some time or other , and no doubt has enough on most of them to hang them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out of the office , be sure to tell her where you are going , so she can give an intelligent answer to anyone interested in your whereabouts . Remember that your receptionist makes the initial impression on a person entering the office , and whether this impression is good or bad may be very important . Bear this in mind when choosing someone for the job . Pick someone who not only looks bright but is . It takes brains , tact , a cool head , good looks and lots of patience to fill this job of office goat . All in all , the telephone operator is a pretty important person around any office . She seems to he able to get Paris , Peiping and Podunk on the wire with equal ease . She keeps panhandling friends , blackmailing enemies and irrepressible salesmen from breaking through her line of defense , and in turn is usually able to penetrate even the most imposing phalanx of secretaries when you want to reach their employer on the telephone . So , if she does a good job , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her ear , accuse her  --  justly or unjustly  --  of getting you the wrong party , or comment into the transmitter on dumb operators , or the call from the wilderness may prove too much for your telephone operator too . An equitable distribution of the work probably contributes more to the creation of a smooth-running office than any other single factor . A stenographer should be assigned to a particular man  --  or men , as the case may be  --  and only on rare occasions should she be called upon to help out anyone else . If it is necessary to assign one girl to two men , be sure that one of the men at least is reasonable , patient and willing to co-operate . While this may be hard on the Caspar Milquetoast end of the team , it is absolutely necessary , or the poor stenographer will never have any peace . This business of working for no one in particular is like being an orphan  --  there is no one to look out for your welfare . The following hints should be helpful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assume your secretary is of normal intelligence until proved otherwise . A secretary will give her best efforts to a man who respects her intelligence and assumes that she will do a given job to the best of her ability . 2 . If you want your secretary to assume responsibility , expect and demand that she assume it . If she is ever to be of any real value to you , she must learn to do things without too much direction . When you give her instructions , take it for granted that she will carry them out . Do n't be a nagger and inquire every half hour whether or not something has been done . Prodding is no help to a stenographer , particularly if she is working on a. rush job . Let your secretary know which jobs should have priority . And above all , do n't let your stenographer stay overtime to do what she has been told is a rush job , and then have her find the masterpiece On your desk a week later , untouched . Do n't , that is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will really want her to do a job in a hurry . 3 . A knowledge of the mechanics of typing would be helpful to employers . If they knew the limitations of a typewriter , they would not make so many impossible and time-wasting requests . There is the man who says , " Just make a draft of this with four or five copies  --  they might come in handy . " Or the one who says , " This letter is fine , but you might add a word here at the end of this sentence , " or " I 'd rather have this letter on one page instead of two . " 4 . If you contemplate some change in an employee 's routine , though seemingly minor , discuss it with her before making it . An office can be completely demoralized by unexpected changes . An employee 's sense of responsibility and loyalty may be permanently outraged by a sudden transition to another desk , another boss or other duties , without an explanation of any kind and for no reason apparent to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the diplomacy a career man in the State Department could muster . It is a matter which should be approached with delicacy and forethought . In this connection , typewritten transcription seems to heat the bottom of a good deal of the trouble . If you find a phrase which looks strange to your eyes on a page of transcription , and you are sure it is quite foreign to anything you have dictated , give pause before attempting to approach the guilty transcriber . An error in transcription is to most men what Communism is to Hitler . The usual procedure is to mark through the offending word or phrase with several large strokes of a pen or indelible pencil  --  this is an office crime comparable to the domestic offense of beating your wife . The outraged victim of the error then rushes forth to the offender 's desk waving the mutilated paper and shouting at the culprit , " You made a mistake ! You made a mistake ! " Some Do 's and Don'ts The following substitute procedure is recommended : Cheek the margin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so that a correction can be made , if possible , and do n't look too much like the cat that caught the canary when you point out the error . It is not necessary to fix the blame on either party , though if you think there is a possibility you yourself might be at fault in a particular instance , an admission on your part would probably cause a rise in your hero stock . A complaint often made by dictators is , " I did n't say that . " In cases of this kind the transcriber has very little comeback unless the medium used was a dictating machine . 6 . If you have any preferences , speaking euphemistically , as to bow certain things should be done , tell your secretary what they arc . Do n't keep quiet . and allow what seems to be carelessness on her part to sear your soul , when it could be remedied . Af ter all , secretaries are not mind readers . They may be able to guess some of your whims , but if the day @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vertically instead of horizontally , do n't keep it a secret . Once your secretary understands these things , she will be glad to humor you . 7 . If you are not an authority on grammar , do n't be afraid to let your secretary know that you recognize this weakness of yours . You ca n't keep it a secret from her if she is up on her job , and she will be not only more willing but much better able to help you write a good letter if you freely admit your shortcomings in this respect . It 's no disgrace not to know all the ins and outs of the King 's English , but it is unnecessary to proclaim your ignorance in writing when there are good secretaries for hire . 8 . Do n't ask your secretary to work overtime just because your family is out of town and you have nothing else to do ; or want her to work until six every night because that is the time you meet your wife for dinner and you have to kill time until then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ closing time and then expect to have the work out if you want to leave on the dot . An office irritant of the first water is to be given personal letters to write near the end of a hard day 's work or just before noon on Saturday . The Overtime Bugaboo Late in the afternoon is a bad time to dictate in any event. , as everyone is tired , the mail has to be taken rare of , and so on . Besides , you know whether or not you are going to cease dictating when it is time to go home , but your stenographer does n't , and she is bound to be a little uneasy if she has a date to meet her favorite playmate after work . No girl should object to a reasonable amount of overtime , when it is necessary , but she should be consulted as to whether or not it is convenient for her to stay . Keeping a girl even five or ten minutes after closing time every night is just thoughtlessness , but it can be very annoying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ usually arrange to get away on time , and your secretary should have the same privilege . If constant overtime is necessary , the answer is more help or additional compensation . The first alternative is to be preferred , as much overtime impairs efficiency during regular working hours . Of course , the amount of overtime you can ask of an employee depends largely on the responsibility of the job , pay and chances of advancement . If you like to work until seven every night , why not assign one girl to do the overtime work and have her come in at eleven in the morning instead of nine ? 9 . Maintaining the right manner toward your amanuensis is uo easy matter . Some men are too personal one minute and to businesslike the next . If you comment on the becomingness of your secretary 's dress in the morning and tell her in the afternoon that she is hopelessly dumb , do n't be surprised if she bursts into tears . Above all , do n't make some personal remark and then close up like a clam @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sarY 7 , resg ventures a reply . Do n't urge privileges upon her which she would n't ordinarily expect and then refuse her something which , in the normal course of events , would be her due . Do n't be like the man who urged his secretary to take as long as she wanted for lunch and not always to hurry back right on the hour . She took him at his word and tried this one day . On her return she met him striding up and down the hall , peering anxiously toward the elevator . He paced her to her desk and started dictating before she had time to remove her hat , much less to open her notebook and snatch a pencil . It has been held by the courts at various times that a stenographer is not a person , but merely an impersonal facility used in making and transmitting communications , in the same class with telephones , typewriters and other office fixtures . Your secretary may not be a person in the strictly legal sense , but if you feel that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . No one enjoys being treated like a machine . It goes without saying that it is better to be too businesslike than too personal . The ideal , of course , is a businesslike attitude tempered with sympathy , understanding , or a sense of humor , depending on the occasion . Now that you know what constitutes an office hero in the eyes of your Tillie the Toiler , it is hoped you will submit yourself to a little self-analysis and see whether you belong in the hero class . From your point of view , here 's the situation in a capsule  --  if you receive the acid test of approval from your secretary , you can go about your business pretty certain that you are quite a man .
