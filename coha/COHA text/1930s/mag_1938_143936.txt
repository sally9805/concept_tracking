Thirty years ago the most eminent of all U. S. composers , Edward Alexander MacDowell , died in Manhattan 's Westminster Hotel . Known most widely for his piano piece , To a Wild Rose , courtly , affable MacDowell was internationally famed for an imposing list of orchestral suites , symphonic poems , piano concertos , songs and instrumental solo pieces . Sensitive and nervous by temperament ( a mental breakdown hastened his death at 46 ) , MacDowell loved the country , drew inspiration and titles for his music from nature . Eventually he bought himself a strip of wooded land near Peterboro in southern New Hampshire , where he spent his last years . Before he died he expressed a wish that this country refuge might be made available to other composers , paint-ters , writers who were anxious to work in country quiet . But the realization of his wish required more money than Idealist MacDowell had saved . <P> The task of raising funds fell largely to his frail widow . Tirelessly , in spite of a spinal ailment that made exertion difficult @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concerts ( she is a good pianist ) , talking , gleaning contributions to keep the MacDowell Colony going . During the past 30 years she has succeeded in personally raising some $100,000 . The Colony has grown , occupies today some 500 acres sprinkled with isolated cottages , with room for 50 artists each summer . A list of those who have benefited by its hospitality at one time or another , reads like a Who 's Who of the U. S. artistic world . <P> Two-and-a-half years ago Edward Lynn , a grateful MacDowell Colony alumnus who now writes radio scripts in Hollywood , and Mrs. Natalie Alden Putnam , a Hollywood piano teacher , hit on the idea of holding an annual radio festival in honor of the composer . Choosing the date of MacDowell 's death for their Festival <P> Week , they approached Los Angeles broadcasting stations suggesting programs of MacDowell 's music . Every Los Angeles station cooperated enthusiastically . The following year the two colleagues broadened the scope of their festival , enlisted National Broadcasting Co. , Columbia Broadcasting System and nearly 60 independent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Festival boomed far beyond U. S. borders . Manhattan 's New York Philharmonic-Symphony , under slope-shouldered Georges Enesco , broadcast MacDowell 's symphonic poem Lancelot and Elaine over the Columbia network . Other commemorative broadcasts were heard over Columbia , NBC , Don Lee , and Canadian broadcasting systems , as well as 56 independent stations . Additional MacDowell broadcasts were heard from one station each in Ireland , Sweden , England , Australia , Poland . Norway , and from three stations in Germany , where MacDowell spent his most fruitful student years . <P> Such widespread publicity , its sponsors hope , will bring additional funds to carry on the good work of the MacDowell Colony . Meanwhile , bustling , grey-haired , bright-faced little Marian Nevins MacDowell continues to lecture , to work incessantly in the Colony 's interests . Next summer she hopes to be in Peterboro , as usual , administrating its affairs .
