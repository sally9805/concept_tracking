FELICIANA - Stark Young - Scribner ( $2.50 ) . For cool summer fiction , few readers turn to the snarling , high-pressure , melodramatic novels of the new South . But the South that Stark Young has described in River House , So Red the Rose and other volumes is one of the coolest and sweetest tempered areas in U. S. letters , a gracious , rainless land in which the people all seem to be kin , where liquor and food are always excellent , and where oblique , unconsciously-poetic remarks can be plucked like ripe figs from the most casual conversation . Although the inhabitants of Stark Young 's South seem to grow animated only when they discuss family history , they are distinguished by their even tempers and their love for their own quiet sections of the temperate zone . They may suffer like gentlefolk from post-Civil War melancholy but never from prickly heat . <P> A collection of sketches dealing largely with Louisiana , Mississippi and Texas scenes and characters , Feliciana offers few surprises to readers of So Red the Rose . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the career of a dead kinsman , Cousin Micajah , who loved the girl his brother loved and joined Fremont 's expedition to California because " he did not wish to complicate things . " In brief and amusing sketches , Stark Young reports his conversations with a good-natured Negro boy , Virgil , writes of old Eph of Texas , whose one idiosyncrasy , even as an old man , was to chase fire engines ; of a Texas game warden who told him , during a long discussion of crime , chorus girls , Western cinemas and the use of cavalry in modern warfare , that in Prohibition days more game wardens than revenue agents were killed in the line of duty . Unlike So Red the Rose , which contained implicit and explicit criticisms of modern society , the tales in Feliciana are casual and fragmentary , contain only marginal sociological comment . Some times Stark Young seems little more than a leisurely collector of old Southern impressions , exhibiting dissociated bits of conversations , rare historical items , with the polite , after-dinner wit of one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ affectations with the contented days and rich histories of small Southern and Western towns , he finds humor , common sense and human decency characteristic of the provincials . His portraits of them would carry more conviction if occasionally human sweat and hot temper broke the serenity of his air-conditioned South .
