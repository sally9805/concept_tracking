txt The State Department was accused today by John Hamilton , chairman of the Republican National Committee , of making " literally hundreds of deceptive and , in some cases , curate statements " in memoranda issued in behalf of the Reciprocal 1Trade Agreement program . " Adopting a tone similar to that in which Secretary Hull wrote two weeks ago to Senator Pope of Idaho expressing amazement at the quantity of " misinformation " about the trade program contained in a farm paper editorial , Mr. Hamilton , in a 2,500-word letter to the Secretary , asserted that he was sure Mr. Hull was " not aware of the misleading propaganda being issued by your department  --  propaganda which is harmful to all and . helpful to none . " Coming at a time when the Administration 's new farm program is faced with falling prices because of huge crop surpluses , the Hamilton letter was regarded by some as indicating the Republicans ' method of attack on the trade agreement program in the pre-election campaign in the farm areas . Criticizes Choice of Years " Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about these concessions and the advantage ' to each State from them , " Mr. Hamilton wrote . " In these memoranda , years have been selected which will show our foreign trade in the most advantageous light for the trade agreements . The whole statistical picture is not given . " The " concessions " to which Mr. Hamilton referred were those which Secretary Hull ; in his letter to Senator Pope , declared the United - States was getting abroad " for both farm and factory products " through the trade agreements program . Mr. Hamilton also questioned Mr. Hull 's contention that the trade agreement program was " the most powerful constructive force in the interests of world peace . " " I can not reconcile this statement with the facts , " Mr. Hamilton'said.1 " The Roosevelt Administration has increased its expenditures for national defense from $540,000,000 for the pre-agreement fiscal year 1934 to $1,028,000,000 for the fiscal year 1938 . The State Department has issued licenses for the export of war materials of $14,438,934 for the first six months of 1936 , $22,281,487 for the same period @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ period in 1938 . " In view of your constant contention that the reciprocal trade agreements constitute a force in the interest of world peace , do you not agree that it ' is ironical that in ordertr to defend your program you are compelled to rely on figures comprising such huge increases in the export trade of this country in war material ? " For Multilateral Pact As a substitute ' for the reciprocal trade agreement program Mr. Hamilton proposed a multilateral agreement such as former President Hoover proposed . " Excessive trade barriers do promote world " unrest , " said Mr. Hamilton . " The only way to lower them is through a multilateral agreement . This is why President Hoover promoted and helped to bring into being the London Economic Conference of 1933 . Then the world was in a receptive mood for such an agreement . " However , President Roosevelt scuttled this conference , which had real possibilities of bringing about a better condition of world trade and finance . I think , since President Roosevelt is responsible for the failure of this conference , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ program is better than a multilateral accord . " He asked Secretary Hull to explain " the logic of your trade agreement policy of lowering tariffs , while at the same time the Wallace farm policy restricts our domestic farm production , and attempts to peg prices above the world level ? " " Has either of these policies helped the farmer , especially the cotton farmer who is dependent on a foreign market for his crop ? " he went on . " Are they not contradictory and harmful to the country ? Are not full crops at fair prices more beneficial to all than restricted crops at prices which can not be maintained without permanent loss of our foreign outlets and without impairment of standards I of living ? " Raising the question because , he said , Mr. Hull , in his letter to Senator Pope , had held the HawleySmoot Act responsible for throttling imports " and hence our ex , port trade , " Mr. Hamilton asked why the State Department " always compares present trade figures with those of 1934 or some later year instead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the HawleySmoot Act became effective . " Offers 1929 Comparison He proceeded : " Is it not because our export trade to non-trade agreement countries in 1937 was nearer to the 1929 level than was our trade with trade agreement countries in 1937 ? And is it not because our imports from non-trade agreement countries were relatively less compared with the 1929 level than imports from the trade agreement countries ? " In 1937 our exports , in dollar value , to non-trade agreement countries were 65.7 per cent of the 1929 level , while to trade agreement countries our exports were but 63.5 per cent of the 1929 level . And in 1937 our imports from the nontrade agreement countries were 68.3 per cent of the 1929 level , while from trade agreement countries our imports were 73.1 per cent of the 1929 level . " This same condition is true if the trade figures for the first half of 1937 are compared with the same period in 1938 . " Our foreign trade was larger in 1937 than in 1936 , exports of domestic merchandise increasing from $2,418,000,000 in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increase of $876,000 , - 000 or by 36.2 per cent , and imports for consumption going from $2,424 , - 000,000 in 1936 to $3,010,000,000 in 1937 , . an increase of $586,000,000 or by 24.2 per cent . " Exports in value increased more than imports . However , in volume , which is more important than value because of the changes in the value of the dollar and the price changes , exports in 1937 were but 79.5 per cent of 1929 , while imports in 1937 were equal to 1929 . But the world volume of trade in 1937 was 96.6 per cent of 1929 . " " Example " of " Deception " In pressing his charge of " deception " in memoranda sent out by the State Department , Mr. Hamilton offered instances . One of these was as follows : " For example , the memorandum entitled ' Kentucky and the TradeAgreements Program ' states on page four , ' The Netherlands bound themselves against increasing the present duty on seed leaf , Maryland , Kentucky , Tennessee and Virginia types , and increased @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quantity and 37 per cent in value in 1937 as compared with 1935 . ' " This statement leads one to believe that our exports of tobacco to The Netherlands have greatly increased over previous years . However , on examination of the following table , which gives exports in both value and volume for 1929 , the last year before the Hawley-Smoot act became effective , and from 1932 to 1937 , an entirely different and correct picture of our tobacco exports is presented . " From this table we note that exports in both value and volume for 1935 , the year chosen for comparison , were the lowest they had been for a great number of years . We further see that exports in quantity in 1937 , the year you exalt , were 19.6 per cent below 1932 , the very bottom of the world depression , and 46.8 per cent below 1929 . " Also we note that exports in dollar value in 1937 were only .8.6 per cent above 1932 , despite the 41 per cent devaluation of the gold dollar , and 59.9 per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Dutch currency these 1937 tobacco exports to The Netherlands were 20.5 per cent below what The Netherlands bought from us in 1932 and 70.7 per cent below her 1929 purchases . With this analysis one gets a picture of the merits and worth of this concession . quite different from the one told by the State Department . "
