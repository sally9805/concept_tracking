At the instance of a number of crackpots , speculators , inflationists , amateur economists and the Senators from six Western States , the U. S. embarked upon a silver-buying program . To date the most conspicuous result of the Administration 's silver policy is that the Treasury in a little more than four years has purchased about 1400,000,000 oz. of a metal whose prime characteristic is its futility . And much of it was purchased at prices considerably above last week 's quotation of 44 per oz. , which is an entirely artificial figure since the U. S. has been buying most of the world 's silver production . Last week , for the first time since it was inaugurated , the silver-buying program was turned to practical account Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau announced that beginning All Fools ' Day he would buy no more silver from Mexico . <P> Last winter Secretary Morgenthau was asked whether he would stop subsidizing the Mexican silver mines in retaliation for prohibitive boosts in Mexican tariffs on U. S. goods . The reply : " We do n't mix @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , knowing that silver and politics have been well-mixed for over half a century , was playing innocent-as he was last week when he refused to confirm the obvious fact that he was now mixing silver and oil . For the wording of his statement made it perfectly clear that he had withdrawn his subsidy in retaliation for President Crdenas ' seizure of $400,000,000 worth of foreign oil investments ( TIME , March 28 ) . The action had been taken , said the Secretary , " in view of the decision of the Government of the United States to re-examine certain of its financial and commercial relationships with Mexico . " The " good neighbor policy " had given way to silver-dollar diplomacy . <P> Curiously , the heavy pressure on the State Department , which gave Mr. Morgenthau his orders , did not come from U. S. oil men . Not until after the day after the announcement did a delegation of U. S. oil men headed by Standard Oil 's Walter Clark Teagle formally protest to Secretary of State Hull . The effective pressure came from Britain , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the U. S. It is the theory of the British Foreign Office that if it is to be prevented , by the Monroe Doctrine , from following its normal policy in dealing with backward countries in such affairs , then the least the U. S. can do is to see to it that the natives maintain a decent regard for Anglo-Saxon property rights .
