ON APRIL 30th of next year New York will open its first world 's fair ; and though it has been in preparation since 1935 , some of us New Yorkers have not yet got used to the idea . This sort of thing seems out of our line ; let Chicago have the world 's fairs so long as we can have the world 's series . But slowly it is dawning on us that this will be no ordinary fair . " Unique and incomparable , " says its president ; the first one ever built , according to its official announcement , on a constructive world concept . " This formal theme is Building the World of Tomorrow ; but our Fair is also to be devoted to the Creation of a Better and a Fuller Life , the Discernment and Pursuit of the Public Good , and the cause of World Peace . These are spacious purposes but it will be a spacious enterprise ? the biggest world 's fair ever held , perhaps the best , and certainly the most expensive . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Grover Aloysius Whalen , president of the World 's Fair Corporation ; a man with a long record of service in municipal government and private business , but best known as America 's greatest greeter . He was the organizer and active head of the Mayor 's Committee for the Reception of Distinguished Guests ; he promoted those stupendous welcomes to our city amid showers of ticker tape and cheering crowds , which were bestowed on Kings , Queens , Princes , Presidents , Cardinals , Field Marshals , Prime Ministers , Transatlantic flyers , and Channel swimmers . Now he has the biggest greeter 's job of his life ? to welcome to New York next year millions of his fellow-countrymen ( and Europeans too , unless Europe is blowing itself off the map by that time ) and to send them home feeling that they have got their money 's worth . He is the man for the job ; the Fair has enlisted the best artistic and executive talent in New York but it bears the stamp of Whalen 's personality ; and few citizens would deny that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is the man to put it over . " A greater showman than Barnum , " said one who used to work with him ; and such a man is useful in these times . The dictators have discovered that you can make people forget the scarcity of bread if you give them enough circuses ; the democracies , doing the best they can to meet the first need , are apt to fall short when it comes to the second . But London has the British royal family , and New York has Whalen ; Hitler and Mussolini may give bigger shows , but if he had their budgets to play with he could probably teach them something . Once , at a testimonial dinner for Whalen ( this peculiar New York institution has been eaten oftener in his honor than in anyone else 's ) the chairman observed , " When New York wants a hard job done we have the habit of saying , ' Grover , you 're elected . ' He never says no , and he always accomplishes more than we had hoped . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is also true that he always spends more money than they had expected . Not his money , their money . II Whalen was born in 1886 on the lower Fast Side , the son of a well-to-do contractor . People who remember the old gentleman say that he loved parades . He drove a pair of smart horses ; and when there was a parade in which he was to have a place Michael Whalen managed to arrive at the very last moment before it started , driving all along the waiting line in solitary splendor and bowing to the crowds . It is a pity he could not have lived to see his son outdo him as Alexander outdid Philip . But he died while Grover was in law school , and the son had to quit his studies to go into the family business . He did well and married well ? into the social stratum that used to be known as the lace-curtain Irish ? and was a rising young business man when the municipal campaign of 1917 came along . New York had been groaning for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back to normalcy . Whalen , who had been born into Tammany democracy as he was born into the Catholic faith , organized a Business Men 's League which was active in the campaign that elected John F. Hylan Mayor , and was rewarded by appointment as the Mayor 's secretary . A good many New Yorkers found Hylan as Mayor what Henry Adams found Grant as President ? " a defiance of first principles ; he should have been extinct for ages . " Nevertheless , when the War was over it fell to this survival of an earlier geological epoch to receive officially more distinguished foreigners than New York had seen for decades ; and Hylan at least knew enough to turn the job over to somebody who could do it Of his reception committee Rodman Wanamaker was chairman , but Whalen was vice-chairman and active head ; he provided the ideas and the energy , Wanamaker furnished the front and took care of the deficit . If the route of Whalen 's ceremonial parades took the distinguished visitors right between the two buildings of Wanamaker 's store , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ purpose of these greetings was to portray New York in a true light ; to show the world that it is not a cold and indifferent city , but has a warm heart and a sympathetic hand . " The distinguished guests were often pretty limp by the time the warm heart and sympathetic hand had been working on them all the way up from the Battery to the Waldorf-Astoria , for they were never let off anything ; the King and Queen of the Belgians , coming in quietly under technical incognito , had to be ferried back from the Waldorf to the Battery the next morning to go through the regular routine . But it was an impressive show and little was left to chance ; at one reception Whalen had more than a thousand people working tinder eightytwo squad leaders , drilled by long rehearsals to take their proper part in the ritual of welcome . The throwing of ticker tape from office windows seems to have been the accidental inspiration of some clerk in a broker 's office ; but it was Whalen 's fertile mind that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when lower Broadway was full of people going out to lunch , so that however unfamiliar to the public the distinguished visitor might be he always encountered a crowd . These displays , which familiarized the town with visiting celebrities , also made New York aware of Whalen , by personal observation or newspaper photographs ? Whalen and his silk hat and morning coat with the white carnation ( not , as often said , a gardenia ) in the buttonhole ; heading the committee that went down the bay in the tug Macom to meet the distinguished guests , and seldom out of the picture thereafter . To-day he would probably be recognized on the street by more persons than any other New Yorker except Al Smith , Babe Ruth , and Jack Dempsey . The guests became aware of him too ; out of his service as greeter he harvested a crop of foreign decorations and an extensive and useful acquaintance among the great . But these receptions which made Whalen famous were only interludes in a departmental job ; in 1919 he had been appointed city Commissioner of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and ultimately of some bus lines . In that post he displayed the qualities that have distinguished him ever since ? a violent energy ( not always certain of its direction ) , a fertile imagination , and indifference to expense ; though the great extravagances of the Hylan administration lay outside his department . In 1922 an investigation disclosed that some of the bus lines over which he had jurisdiction were owned through dummies by Tammany politicians ; but when this was called to the Commissioner 's attention he replied loftily , " I am not interested in that feature of bus operation . " In the curious world of political business and businesslike politics which the average citizen never explores , he knows his way round ; but he has held office in some rather smelly periods , and come out without any stain on his personal integrity . To say that he was one of the assets of the Hylan administration may be damning him with faint praise . But he was ; indeed he became too much of an asset for HyIan 's comfort . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the reception committee , in the operation of his department stores . He said he owed it to his family to make the change ( the Wanamaker salary was several times as much as he was getting ) , but he had been uncomfortable in office for some time . Hylan had been sniping at him and was reputed to be jealous of his prominence and popularity . There was to be a city election the next year , Hylan was going to try for a third term , and Whalen looked like a dangerous rival . Rut Whalen was happy in his new job and new offices ( more sumptuous , after he had decorated them , than anything in the City Hall ) , and it was Jimmie Walker who beat Hylan in the primary of 1925 . Whalen supported him , thereby incurring accusations of ingratitude that seem undeserved . Men who know him well saythat he has a livelier appreciation of favors to come than of those that are past , but that is a common habit of politicians ; and what he had done for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Under Walker he continued to receive distinguished guests ; the inflow of visiting royalty had dried up but there were new heroes and heroines whom New York delighted to honor ? Lindbergh , Gertrude Ederle , and other flyers and swimmers now forgotten . Whalen 's welcomes were more elaborate than ever ; but Wanamaker died early in 1928 , and with that unfailing guarantor gone , the committee usually had to pass the hat to make up a deficit that could hardly be put on the city budget . They always made it up , however ; for those were the boom years , when plenty of rich men were eager to come up with a contribution that might earn a little good will at the City Hail without offending the most delicate sense of ethics . ( Later , when hard times came on , not even Whalen could find such men . ) Between receptions meanwhile Whalen was running a department store and picking up ideas which he is now using in world 's fair promotion ; and was gradually acquiring those memberships on the boards of civic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Citizen . But at the end of 1928 he was drafted into the public service again , into what was traditionally the hardest and most thankless job in the city government ? the Commissionership of Police . The summons was a tribute to the man as New York knew him ; he may not have been just the Commissioner we needed , but he was exactly the Commissioner that Jimmie Walker needed . II/ Mr. Arnold Rothstein , reputed to be our leading racketeer , had been murdered , and the police were not finding out who had murdered him . Most citizens , if they could have found the murderer , would have pinned a medal on him ; but they felt that something was wrong if the police could n't turn him up . The Police Commissioner , able and honest but miscast , worried himself into a nervous breakdown ; the department was disturbed and uneasy ; the situation called for a man who could Do Things , and do them so spectacularly that people would forget whatever was not done . Whalen filled the bill . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other prominent racketeers killed during his incumbency ; but he announced so frequently that he was on the point of catching them that most people probably took the will for the deed . There were other problems before the police besides unsolved murders ; one of them being the theater-district traffic , which always tended to snarl up before and after the show . Philip D. Hoyt , a deputy police commissioner who was the department 's traffic expert , had evolved a plan for straightening it out ; but it took Whalen 's genius to make the new system a big front-page story . On the evening it was put into operation Times Square was packed with an expectant crowd brought out by the preliminary ballyhoo ; when Whalen arrived ( complete with white carnation ) at the police booth in the middle of the square from which he was to direct his men like an old-fashioned general on the battlefield , even the sober Times compared the scene to one of his own receptions of a distinguished guest . But this time he was guest as well as host @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd roared welcome , flashlights blazed and newsreel cameras whirred , the Commissioner waved his hat and took a bow ; and Jimmie Walker , hearing of the uproar at dinner , had to come over in a hurry to get in on the tail end of the publicity . Between one thing and another , Commissioner Whalen was seldom absent from the front page . Now it was a general shakeup of high police officials , now a new uniform for the department , designed by the Commissioner ( he loves to design uniforms ) ; now the opening of a Police College for the advanced education of his men ( the unfeeling educational authorities of the State refused to let him call it a college , but it did some good work , though it cost a lot of money ) ; now an illegal raid on a birth-control clinic ( but Whalen denied responsibility for that , and the whole affair was hastily dropped ) ; now a crusade against the Communists ; now the smashing by axe squads of what he called " the speakeasies that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that were frequented by persons of prominence . In fact , about the only way in which he never achieved front-page publicity was by catching the perpetrators of front-page murders . There never was a Police Commissioner like him . On his desk stood a bronze statuette of Napoleon , and his methods were Napoleonic even if his achievements fell somewhat short . He took office in semi-formal morning dress and thereafter set a new sartorial standard for Headquarters ; but though he was always doing something with violent energy he always looked immaculate and unruffled . In the Headquarters barber shop he had a personal chair , the best on the market , in which he was shaved every morning and in which nobody else was ever shaved at all . When weather permitted he always rode in an open car ? a police car of course , with a police chauffeur and siren . Whenever he got out the chauffeur had to come round and occupy the seat vacated by the Commissioner , to keep it warm in winter , to keep it cool when the rays of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ placed where Whalen could reach it , and he blew his own horn as he went along . ( An irreverent citizen who once gave him the Bronx cheer as he drove past was promptly arrested , but released with the warning that it would have gone hard with him if the Commissioner had cared to prosecute . ) He used to attend all the big fires in person and sometimes annoyed the firemen by telling them how to put them out . In short , while he may not have made any touchdowns , he gained an unprecedented amount of yardage in newspaper columns ? far more than Mayor Walker was getting . And as Walker 's second term rolled on , and he too like Hylan began to think about a third , he felt about ? Whalen as Hylan had felt in his day . The fellow was getting all the publicity , biting the hand that fed him ; a useful subordinate threatened to become a dangerous rival . So once again a Mayor began quarreling with Commissioner Whalen , and once again Wanamaker 's , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way out . In May , 1930 Whalen resigned and went back to the store . Newspaper comment on his service as Police Commissioner seems lacking in gratitude to a man who had been the biggest producer of raw material for newspaper city rooms . The Times praised him tepidly , but added that " if he had been a perfect Commissioner he would probably never have been appointed . " The World said that " no one else can hope to equal his record in starting things that he can not finish , " and pronounced him " almost all superstructure . " Now that may have been true of Whalen as Police Commissioner ; it is very far from true of Whalen in general . Even as Police Commissioner it is the testimony of men who were there before him and were there after him that he left the force better off than he found it ? with a more efficient organization , a healthier morale . There have been better Commissioners since ; but what good he did lives after him , and his extravagances begin to blend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in that last boom year . The bronze statuette of Napoleon moved out of Headquarters when he did ; the glittering barber 's chair in which he used to sit enthroned was sent , eventually , to the Municipal Lodging House . Tramps are shaved in it now . IV In 1930 Whalen may have looked to some people Iike the next Mayor of New York ; but times grew harder , politically as well as economically . The scandals of the Walker administration brought on an investigation ; Walker resigned and the next year the Democratic city organization split wide open , the other four county machines , with New Deal backing , fighting Tammany . Whalen , who had got out of the Walker administration with his hands clean , was often mentioned as a possible candidate in 1933 ; but with the party divided and discredited it was a good time for a man with a store to keep to go on keeping it . In due time La Guardia beat both Democratic candidates ; and Whalen was Ieft in the happy position of a man who knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but who did not have to undertake the tough job of being a good mayor among the debris left by sixteen years of Hylan and Walker . He had other civic functions to perform in those years , one of which has left painful memories ? painful to him , more painful to others . In 1932 he was made chairman of the local committee for celebration of the Washington bicentennial . In that desperate year people were looking for almost anything that might make work and start business up again ; Whalen 's committee undertook to do it , on a small scale , by a process since become familiar ? spending the money and trusting to a pickup in business to meet the bills . They built a replica of Mount Vernon in Prospect Park , Brooklyn ; and one of Federal Hall , where Washington was inaugurated in the little old New York of 1789 , in Bryant Park , Manhattan . They did make some work , but it needed more than that to prime even a local pump in 1932 ; and this time when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's deficits very little was dropped into it . That committee left bills running up into a good many thousands of dollars , and some of them are unpaid even yet . But 1933 was a happier story ? the year of recovery , and of the NRA that was supposed to make recovery permanent . When it was proposed to put over NRA by a nation-wide ballyhoo Whalen , who was chairman of the New York NRA committee , was right at home . He got up in honor of the Blue Eagle the greatest parade ever seen in New York ? a quarter of a million people marching , a million and a half looking on . If the ghost of Michael Whalen was permitted to drive a team of spectral horses down the length of that parade he certainly must have been proud of his boy . NRA and other civic activities were keeping Whalen in the newspapers , but once again he was beginning to be unhappy in his job . He and Rodman Wanamaker had got along like Ludendorff and Hindenburg ; but Wanamaker was dead @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pharaoh who knew not Joseph . Whalen , however , has a talent that was also Woodrow Wilson 's ; when he has to get out of an uncomfortable situation he can always find an exit leading upward . Repeal had come , and the newly legalized liquor industry needed executives ( or at least front men ) with good standing in politics as well as in business . In January , 1934 , Whalen left Wanamaker 's to become chairman of Schenley Products ; from which he resigned three years later to make a fulltime job of the World 's Fair . V He was the man for the moment ; but the way had been prepared for him by a sequence of the right men at other moments . The idea of a world 's fair in New York to celebrate the hundred and fiftieth anniversary of Washington 's inauguration may have occurred to various citizens , but the man who worked it out in detail and made it stick was an engineer named Joseph F. Shadgen , born in Luxemburg and educated at Louvain . He was interested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incentive to start something ; he had a little money in the bank , so he could take time to start it right . Obviously the first thing was to find theright location for the Fair , otherwise the idea would be smothered in the wrangles of rival real estate dealers . The site Shadgen finally chose was a surprise to most New Yorkers ? the swampy and malodorous banks of a little stream in the semi-suburban borough of Queens , politely known as the Flushing River but actually , thanks to the tidal flow from polluted harbor waters , not much better than an open sewer . But he had eliminated seven locations before he picked that one , which had more space than anything near the center of the city , and better traffic connections than anything else available in outlying districts . Also , it was to be made over some day into a park , and the city already owned about half the area . The next thing was to find sponsors who could sell the idea to a somewhat skeptical town . Here Shadgen called in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approached and converted several men of consequence ? notably George McAneny . At present head of a mortgage company , McAneny has a long record of distinguished service in municipal government and civic reform . He knows everybody , has the confidence of everybody ; he was the ideal chairman for the committee of leading citizens which announced the project of the Fair in September , 1935 . ( Whalen , as a leading citizen , was in it too ; but at first he was in the background . ) In that announcement nothing was said about building the world of to-morrow , or the creation of a better and a fuller life ; it was only predicted that the Fair would " aid materially in stimulating industrial recovery . " A less impressive concept than some that have since emanated from the Theme Committee ; but even in 1935 it was a good reason for having a Fair , and it is a still better reason now . More immediate stimulation was anticipated by interests near the chosen site ; there went up a joyful whoop that the Fair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ real estate . " In general this was justified , but owners of land condemned to round out the Fair site found their high expectations of unearned increment deflated ; the court allowed them less than a third as much as they had asked . These local aspects , however , were relatively unimportant ; the McAneny committee , itself pretty widely representative , had got virtually every important interest in New York committed to support of the Fair before the announcement . Also , city and State and Federal governments are making their contribution in the form of public improvements around the site . A non-profit ( and hence non-taxable ) corporation was organized ; if it makes a profit the money is to be divided between city and State for relief and education , and the site of the Fair is to revert to the city as a park . This gives our vigilant Park Commissioner , Robert Moses , a lively interest in the enterprise ; and it was Moses who first had the courage to point out that McAneny , indispensable at first , had outlived his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ included ; newspaper cartoonists have called him Mariana Mac . In April , 1936 Moses complained that " weaknesses in the management " of the Fair threatened to postpone its opening for a year . Others felt the same way , so presently McAneny was promoted to the chairmanship of the corporation and Whalen was elected as its president . At first he was a dollar-a-year man , retaining the Schenley connection ; but after the Fair corporation had sold twenty-odd million dollars ' worth of bonds and become big-time business , he resigned from Sdienley 's to devote all his time to the new job , at a salary generally believed to be $75,000 a year , with $25,000 for expenses . When this figure was published Fair officials refused either to confirm or deny it on the ground that the Fair corporation was privately financed and hence , presumably , its salary list was nobody 's business . That theory is open to debate , considering the intensive campaign by which the bonds were sold ; in any case such reticence seems pointless , for Whalen has got salaries @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over he will have earned it . Even as a dollar-a-year man he made things move . San Francisco is also to have a world 's fair in 1939 , projected before New York 's , and early recognized by the International Bureau of Expositions in Paris as the Fair of the year . Soon after Whalen took charge , a commissioner of the California Fair visited New York and patronizingly remarked that there would be no conflict , as our show could not open till 1940 . Whalen snapped back that the New York Fair would open as planned on April 30 , 1939 ? and at the rate it is going now he could open it in the middle of March if he wanted to . As for international recognition , Whalen presently went to Paris and gave a lot of dinners ; and when he came back , the New York Fair had been recognized by the International Bureau of Expositions . Meanwhile what was once a swamp along Flushing River has been decontaminated and stiffened up with a whole forest of deep-driven piles ; a park is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ city of amazing buildings is going up . Almost a minor capital , for the Fair Corporation is beginning to take on some of the aspects of a sovereign state . Before its Administration Building flies , alongside the national flag , the Fair 's own flag of blue and orange , with a third staff for the flag of whatever nation or State has a delegation on the grounds that day ; and that third staff is seldom unused . Get past the uniformed attendants in the Fair 's Capitol and you will meet men of national and international renown . Admiral W. H. Standley , retired , once Chief of Naval Operations , is head of the Fair 's foreign relations ; Major-General Dennis E. Nolan , retired , who led Whalen 's NRA parade in 1933 , directs the Division of State Participation ; the Fair even has a Chief of Protocol borrowed from the State Department , to see that distinguished foreigners are received with proper ceremonial . Edward F. Roosevelt , stepfather of the Fair , is there too , as Latin-American Commissioner . But Shadgen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ story . Shadgen has no influential connections , and people say he does n't know how to play ball ; lie disliked some aspects of the Fair 's management , and was tactless enough to say so . For a while he was employed at 4625 a month , but he says they gave him nothing to do but sharpen pencils and eventually they fired him . " He did n't fit at all , " said a Fair official who forgot that but for Shadgen the rest of them would have had nothing to fit into . Now he is suing the management , but many people hope there will be a treaty of peace long before the Fair opens . It would be a pity if it turned out to be a good thing for everybody but its inventor . VI The plan of the Fair ( described by Mr. Gardner Harding in the January HARPER 'S ) and its rainbow color scheme are not Whalen 's work ; they are supervised by a Board of Design ? architects , engineers , landscape artists ? about as competent as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stamped on the Fair in the promotion and the scale of expenditure . A hundred-million-dollar enterprise requires not only executives who are worth high salaries ( though no other salary anywhere near approaches Whalen 's ) but offices of some impressiveness ; yet Fair headquarters would hardly be quite so magnificent if anybody but Whalen were in charge . A whole floor of the Empire State Building is occupied by its sumptuously furnished offices ; including a directors ' room whose cream-leather chairs are worthy of that World Directorate of which utopists dream . Those offices will soon be given up , however , and everything transferred to the Administration Building on the grounds . A very handsome building , except for the strip-tease lady over the front door , who , I believe , represents the Future throwing off the trammeling garments of the Past . ( The Future has never managed to do that yet , but there is no harm in hoping . ) Within , the executive offices look like a Hollywood scene representing a superluxury hotel ; the walls of the state dining room are covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the table ; corridors and offices , hung with architects ' paintings of Fair buildings , give the effect of a modernist art gallery . That building cost $930,000 ? quite a lot of money to spend on something that will have to be torn down in a couple of years . But private exhibitors will spend more than that on structures that are going to be torn down in a couple of years , and some of the Fair 's more flamboyant trappings have been donated by exhibitors ? the copper sheeting of the diningroom wall ; the scarlet-and-silver motor trucks that lately visited the capital of every State , carrying the keys of our city to the Governor ; and even the keys they carried . Contracts are let to the lowest bidder ; there have been squawks , and suits , by unsuccessful competitors , but no more than might be expected in an enterprise of this size . Last year a city Civil Service Commissioner called the Fair a " patronage mill , " and there have been other complaints that Whalen was taking care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reform administration in the City Hall . But the holders of the top jobs all seem to have been selected for their ability ; and certainly the artistic side of the Fair is in the hands of the best men who could be found . Anyway , this is essentially a pumppriming job , not to be confined within the rigid budgetary black-and-red of an ordinary business ; if purchasers of the Fair bonds get their money back with four per cent interest they will be getting all that was promised , all that they expect aside from a boost in business around town . It has been computed that the Fair will pay if it draws fifty million admissions ? or fifteen million people , on the theory that the average visitor pays his way in about three times . No Fair ever drew quite so large a crowd , but the immense population of the metropolitan district is counted on to supply close to a third of the total . That leaves ten or eleven million individuals from outside the vicinity of New York who must come to see @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it is going to take quite a lot of work to bring them in , even if our Fair has the luck to open , as did Chicago 's Century of Progress , just in time to catch the flood tide of a business upturn . When Whalen took charge of the Fair he said that his job was " execution , not promotion " ; but being Whalen , he could n't help doing both . The execution to date seems an excellent job ; but persons who lack his far-ranging vision are beginning to be afraid that the Fair is being over-promoted . New York automobile license plates now bear the legend , " New York World 's Fair 1939 " ; to make room for it the numbers have had to be reduced in size , and are consequently harder to identify when you are trying to find out who hit you as he drives away . But on the whole , that is probably good publicity , carried wherever a New York car takes a vacation party . And the sleeves of the players on our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the insignia of the Fair ? a connected spike and ball , the famous Trylon and Perisphere . Neither the names , the objects themselves , nor the rather pretentious philosophy that has been woven about them have quite sold themselves yet to the public . The Trylon , a steel-framed spike eight hundred feet high , is called the Voice of the Fair ; according to present plans its loudspeaker system will be used only for announcements , and the ear will not be assailed by the incessant din all over the grounds that made life miserable at the Century of Progress . The Perisphere , a steel-and-stucco globe two hundred feet high , is the Theme Center ; within it will be what Fair publicity calls " a vast panorama showing all the elements of society co-ordinated in a better World of To-morrow . " To avoid the congestion that might be caused by people stopping too long to look at this novelspectacle , Whalen has improved on an idea of Barnum 's . It may be remembered that when Barnum 's Museum got too crowded he put up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and a simple public which thought an egress was something like a tigress went right on out . Whalen 's customers are more sophisticated ; but they enter the Perisphere on an escalator that discharges them on a moving platform ; the platform carries them around , and when they have seen the panorama , out is the only place that they can go . The Trylon and Perisphere were needed ( at least something was needed ) to provide a focus for the eye at the axis of the Fair grounds , and give visitors a chance to get their bearings ; and they make a convenient emblem for badges and so on . Much more appalling designs were considered , and discarded . But we may all be pretty sick of the spike and ball before April 30 , 1939 . Says the Fair 's official bulletin : " Women everywhere will be wearing World 's Fair dresses , carrying World 's Fair compacts ; men will sport ( sic ) World 's Fair neckties , use World 's Fair match boxes and playing cards ; wrapping paper @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ World 's Fair motifs , and hundreds of other items of daily use will show the influence of the 1939 Exposition . " All too true . The Bulletin 's cover gives half a dozen sample designs for World 's Fair dress goods ; already you can buy a complete set of table silver embellished with the Trylon and Perisphere ; a ten-cent ? store chain lately bought fifty thousand dozen women 's hats decorated with the spike and ball . Whalen argues that people living at a distance have to get ready for a trip to New York well in advance , and that this design-in-merchandise promotion will get them used to the idea early . Also , he used to keep a store , and is said to believe that merchandise publicity reaches a public untouched by newspaper publicity . Further , the Fair gets a royalty on all merchandise using its designs , which may help balance its budget ? and may not . For it seems possible that a man who this year has seen the spike and ball on his match clips and playing cards , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that wraps his purchases at the store , and on his wife 's hats , dresses , and underwear , may decide when 1939 comes round that he has had an eyeful of the Fair and does n't need to go at all . The Fair 's philosophy too arouses some qualms . Whalen says it had to have a philosophy ; " when I went to Europe I found them cold to the Fair ? they thought it was just another fair . I had to show them it was different . " But these various constructive world concepts had been announced for home consumption long before he ever started warming Europe up . The philosophy as he expounds it in private ? the Fair as a picture of a century and a half of American progress , of the possibilities of the American future , of the economic interdependence of all nations ? makes more sense than some of the press releases that have gone out over his name . But he has laid down the rule that he alone speaks officially for the Fair ; consequently he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were born in the too fertile brains of his publicity staff . For instance : " The Fair will have more than front ; it will have warmth , depth . " Especially warmth ; the Fair grounds are in a valley , and Long Island gets hot in summer time . " The conception of the Perisphere apparently hung on uprushing jets of water is a happy interpretation of the festive quality inherent in an exposition . " Or a symbol of the precarious stability of the World of To-morrow . Announcements of the nocturnal fire-andwater , color-and-sound spectacles that will be given on the lake in the Fair grounds promise " the nearest approach to chaos that Man can contrive for the purpose of sheer entertainment . " Some of us feel that Man is contriving enough chaos for other purposes at present , and that the Fair might give us a rest . The aspect of the Fair 's philosophy that seems to fascinate Whalen just now is itsinfluence in the promotion of world peace . Every important nation intends to exhibit there except Spain and China , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lately withdrew on the pretext of poverty . Whalen expects foreign governments to send military detachments as part of their exhibits , and says that " the massing of fifty thousand American and foreign troops " at the opening will be a " gesture of peace . " Maybe so ; but even with Germany , Spain , and China out of it , they had better keep some of those detachments pretty far apart . On last April 30th there was a preview of Fair preparations , including a motorized parade . Whalen said that underlying the display was the idea of peace on earth , good will to men ; but about half the parade was provided by the army ? tanks , armored cars , field guns , anti-aircraft batteries , truckloads of infantry . A somewhat cynical military man remarked that he could imagine no better preview of the World of To-morrow . VII So it would seem that Whalen has his blank spots . Undoubtedly he Does Things ; but he sometimes seems a little foggy as to why he is doing them , or whether @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he seems the best equipped of New Yorkers to carry through so un-New-Yorkish an enterprise as a world 's fair ; in this respect or that , others might do a better job , but take it as a whole and perhaps no one else could do it at all . The Fair 's calendars , its inter-office memoranda sheets , bear the warning legend , " Time Tears On . " Some people have laughed at that , but Whalen tears on too ; the Fair was far behind schedule when he took charge and is well ahead of it now . That is characteristic of Whalen ; and so is his inability to see the danger that he may promote it to death before it opens . Few men about town have so impressive a front . At fifty-two his figure is still trim and athletic ? he rides a good deal and plays a good deal of handball , even having his private handball courts built in at Wanamaker 's and Schenley 's ; his hair is still plentiful and raven black , and so is his full @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in New York , " Courtenay Terrett called it . So grave a reporter as Ernest Lindley has said that with only a little change of emphasis , Whalen could look like a cop on the strong-arm squad ; with a little change in the other direction , like Mr. Justice Holmes , His taste in dress is rich perhaps but not florid ; he became famous as a greeter in silk hat and cutaway but later preferred a derby and semi-formal dress . At the Fair he affects a blue costume , suit , shirt , and tie of symphonically blended shades , that impresses visitors as a sort of uniform . But perhap it is his brisk bearing , acquired at a military school , that gives that impression . An artist who painted his portrait when he was Police Commissioner was received by Whalen at home , in black pajamas trimmed with red ? " like a uniform symbolic of grim duty and civic power , " his visitor put it . This and other eulogistic remarks were published in the police magazine , issued under the sponsorship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ biographer wrote that " his polished manners have always attracted attention , equaled and balanced by his true spirit of democracy . " This in an authorized biography , which was given away to callers at his office . All of which may throw some light on the man behind the front , or rather on the question whether there is another ' man behind the front . Perhaps the front goes right on through , and he is what he seems . But among men who have known him a long time he seems to be generally liked ; they may be amused by him but they respect his abilities . And amid his refulgences he has his disarming simplicities ; if he is the sort of man who keeps a statuette of Napoleon on his desk , he is also the sort of man who derives an ingenuous pleasure from being shaved in a setting of adequate splendor . His ambitions , at any rate , do not seem to be Napoleonic ; perhaps he usually gets too much fun out of whatever he is doing to look very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ various Democratic factions , and with business men who would distrust the ordinary organization politician , he is not known to look to any office higher than that of Mayor . The governorship would be too drab , perhaps ; Albany is too small a stage for the sort of show he produces . As for higher honors , people have learned to look to the occupant of the White House for bread rather than circuses . Only once did he enter the race for Mayor , or indeed for any elective office ; and that adventure was brief and infelicitous . Early in 1937 , when as usual he was " mentioned " for the Democratic nomination for Mayor , he said he was too busy with the Fair ; but in July he accepted an invitation to enter the primary , saying that he could not refuse " this call from the party . " Unhappily it turned out to be a call from only part of the party ? the Roosevelt-Farley faction that had fought Tammany in 1933 to the disaster of both . Whalen , on good @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be unopposed ; and there was a moment when he might have got Tammany 's support . But the moment was allowed to slip , and Al Smith trotted out Senator Copeland as the anti-Roosevelt candidate . Whalen , seeing that he was in for a bitter primary fight and a probable licking by La Guardia afterward , hastily withdrew and went back to his Fair , where there was nobody to fight him . A wise decision ; if the Fair is a success , and if business is still so bad in 1941 as to discredit whoever is in office , he may be Mayor yet . A Whalen administration would be a good show if the city budget could stand it . Meanwhile he will give you a good show next year , and the visitor who does n't see Whalen and his white carnation will not have seen half of it . But you 'll probably see him ; it was never his habit to lurk in the background .                 @ @ @ @
