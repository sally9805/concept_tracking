Yoga is an ingrown Hindu philosophical system whose object is fusing the " individual soul " with the " universal soul . " Hindu yogins achieve that mystic goal after years of practice in emotional serenity and bodily control . The desired physical relaxation of yoga is achieved by means of contortions which " purify " the body . U. S. devotees of yoga are usually more interested in the philosophical and religious than the gymnastic aspects of the system . In India , on the other hand , the most extraverted yogin to appear in centuries , Swami Kuvalayananda , thinks so highly of the physical side of yoga that he has developed his own special yogic system of physical culture and physical therapy . He maintains a health centre at Bombay . <P> One of Swami Kuvalayananda 's students , Dr. Kovoor Thomas Behanan of Yale , has now published the first physiological analysis of yogic exercises , most of which he found hygienically beneficial. * <P> Dr. Behanan was a graduate student of psychology at Yale in 1931 when he won a Sterling Fellowship on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of one of his country 's strangest cults . Under Swami Kuvalayananda , Dr. Behanan conscientiously underwent a year 's novitiate in yoga . Already acquainted with the philosophy , he concentrated on yoga 's principal calisthenics . <P> Dr. Behanan says he first practiced posterior stretching . Sitting with his legs stretched out he hooked his forefingers over his big toes and touched his knees with his head . This " brings a rich supply of blood to the pelvic organs and tones up the nerves arising from the lower part of the spine . " <P> Next came the plow posture , " one of the finest exercises for keeping the spine flexible and the nerves healthy . " The disciple lies on his back , slowly brings legs and torso over his head until the toes touch the floor and he can gaze only at his navel . <P> Standing topsy-turvy on one 's head for 20 minutes " clarifies the mind , cures dyspepsia and constipation . " Standing similarly on the shoulders " has a beneficial effect on weak sex glands . " <P> All these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an empty stomach , on a firm but soft seat , in a quiet neighborhood , naked except for a loin cloth . <P> Yogins , reports Dr. Behanan , " place a great deal of emphasis on abdominal exercises . . . . Yogins attempt from very early in their practice to gain control of the anal sphincters . The first effort in this direction consists of repeated contraction and relaxation of the sphincters for several minutes in succession . " An adept can , by muscular force alone , ventilate and irrigate his colon , or rinse out his stomach . A photograph of one of Swami Kuvalayananda 's disciples in the latter act is included in Dr. Behanan 's well-illustrated text .
