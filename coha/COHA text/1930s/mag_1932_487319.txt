Al Smith , Statesman A L SMITH , on December 1 , made the most worthwhile and constructive suggestions for a reorganization of the municipal government of the city of New York yet given to the legislative committee of inquiry of which Mr. Seabury is the counsel . It caused his friends greatly to rejoice , because it showed again Mr. Smith 's unusual grasp of governmental problems , his honest , constructive thinking , and his clear , straightforward statement of his position without ifs , buts , compromises , or the usual cloud of words in which the average politician conceals his real thoughts . It caused consternation in Tammany Hall , for Mr. Smith , its most distinguished member , deliberately urged . the dropping of 100 elective officials , the abolition of the costly and complicated borough system under which the city is subdivided into five autonomous districts , the combination of numerous departments , and the regrouping of others so as to make enormous savings and to increase efficiency . He even went so far in his treasonable utterances as to urge that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having them appointed for life  --  by the governor in the higher courts and by the mayor in the lower . No wonder that Tammany squealed ! Of course , if all the changes which Mr. Smith recommends were to take place , the city of New York would be a different place to live in . There would be far greater concentration of responsibility ; the mayor would have greater executive power ; and the present Board of Estimate and Apportionment would be transformed into an upper legislative chamber while the Board of Aldermen would be cut down to twenty-three members . Mr. Smith favored the taking over of all the transit lines by the city . He also urged the immediate construction of model housing for the poor by the use of loans from the Reconstruction Finance Corporation , besides making five other specific recommendations for immediate relief . All his suggestions are particularly valuable at this time , when the city is in dire financial jeopardy  --  at this writing face to face with the possibility that its relief funds will be exhausted on December 7 , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vast amount of short-term notes coming due or to meet all the demands of its pay roll for December . Mr. Smith even presented in well-drafted form the three constitutional amendments which would be required to put certain phases of his scheme into effect . If he devotes ' himself to pushing his plan through he ought to be able to accomplish a great deal . We do not wish , however , to give the impression that it is our belief that if Mr. Smith accomplishes what he asks there will be a model government in New York . To achieve that there would have to be much greater municipal socialization , and the complete control by the city of those special privileges , such as the sale of franchises , pier privileges , and the like , which are now the greatest source of corruption , ' both on the part of the men who have the favors to sell and of those who wish to buy them . Proportional representation the city will still need badly , and probably a city manager , too . But Al Smith @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to becoming a decently organized and managed muncipality , with a judiciary beyond suspicion . War Debts and Taxpayers 1 ? 1HE second British note asking for revision of the war-debt settlements is a masterly document . Not since the Armistice has there been an official communication from one great government to another so admirable in tone , stile , and cogency . While the note calls attention to all the factors which have gravely reduced Great Britain 's capacity to pay the war debt , it raises the discussion far above that immediate and narrow ground . The real question , it emphasizes , is the capacity of the world to endure the economic and financial consequences which the " unnatural transfer " of war-debt payments would involve . The note begins by reminding the United States that the present unparalleled depression is the culmination of the disorder caused by the war , and that while " the causes of the depression may be manifold , it has been generally recognized that war debts and reparations have been one of the major causes . " It follows that " a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ under this head , is an indispensable condition of a revival of general prosperity . " The note goes on to point out that the war loans were made , at bottom , not in the form of money but in the form of goods , and that " if the course of commerce were deflected to the extent required to repay these war-time debts , it would entail a radical alteration in the economy both of debtor and of creditor countries . " In the period from 1923 to 1929 the debtor countries appeared to be repaying these loans , but the payment was really rendered possible by the flow of investment capital from the United States to Europe , so that the prosperity of that period " was to a large extent illusory , " and the system broke down in 1931 . The note next goes on to show that war debts are radically different in nature from debts arising out of the flow of private capital . Private loans are in general used for capital investment which can enable the borrower to " repay them with interest @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the war loans were used for destruction : " Like the shells on which they were largely spent , these loans were blown to pieces . " The note next correctly asserts that the question of the debtor 's " capacity to pay , " even when that phrase is most liberally interpreted , is of secondary importance , and that the question of the intergovernmental debts must be judged by comparison , not with the volume of internal revenue , but with the balance of trade . Yet while the burden of the war debts in terms of goods is twice as great as it was when the debts were contracted , the international trade of the world has fallen to half the value it had only three years ago , and the direct trade between the United States and Great Britain has fallen to one-third its former amount . If the British debt to us is not substantially reduced , Great Britain will be obliged to cut down its purchases from us still further , the sacrifice of its gold reserves will imperil London 's position as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to be undone , the depression will deepen , and commodity prices will continue to fall , " with disastrous consequences from which no nation would be exempt . " The British note remarks that " the loss which both the United Kingdom and the United States taxpayers would suffer from reconsideration of the war debts can not be measured in the same scales as the untold loss of wealth and the human misery caused by the present economic crisis . " Let us , however , make the attempt to measure them in the same scales and see what result we get . The total income of the American people in 1929 was estimated at $85,200,000,000 . Brad-street 's has just estimated that that income in 1932 has shrunk to $37,500,000,000 . This comparison , of course , is based on a comparison of income in terms of dollars . If we allow for the fall of about a third in commodity ' prices , we may say that our national income in terms of goods at the 1929 price level is about $56,200,000,000 . Here is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this we have to balance a loss of $280,000,000 a year , or less than one one-hundredth of that sum , if we were to cancel outright the foreign governmental debts owing to our government . Now let us restate these figures in terms that apply to the individual taxpayer . The per capita national income in 1929 was $704 a year . In 1932 that per capita income , in terms of dollars , has fallen to $300 ; in terms of goods , to approximately $450 . Our federal expenditures in 1933 will came to about $3,300,000,000 , or $26.40 per capita . If the war debts were demanded  --  and were paid  --  this would be reduced by $2.24 . The problem for those who profess to be concerned solely for the American taxpayer , therefore , might ' be stated something like this : Is it better for that taxpayer to have an income of $704 , and pay $26.40 of it in taxes , or is it better for him to pay only $24.16 of his income in taxes , but to have an income of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ income in order to save $2 in taxes ? Should he lose 35 per cent of his income in order to save 73 of 1 per cent ? It may be objected that such a comparison is grossly unfair , because it assumes that if the war debts were canceled we should immediately return to prosperity . But even if we assume that cancelation or reduction would take us only one-tenth of the way back  --  and in our opinion , it would surely do much more than that  --  the gain to the American taxpayer as a result of cancelation or drastic reduction would still be at the rate of more than ten to one . And we must not forget that the slight burden of increased taxes could be equitably distributed , while the loss of income as the result of the world-wide depression is distributed with gross inequity . It has already resulted in practically a total loss of current income for a fourth of our population . We do not see how Congress can remain blind in the face of such facts as these , or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ document as the British note , or as ' the French note which reinforces it . If President Hoover were to recommend revision regardless of Congress 's attitude , his action would not only show statesmanship ; it would be of immense importance in the next few months . Even if Congress should , in spite of all , take the monstrous course of rejecting the President 's plea , our relations with Europe would be far less perilous than if his plea had not been made . For Europe would know that a Congress with its eyes closed and its fingers in its ears was not all America , and that there was still hope for reason and sanity . A Warning to Doctors Lunacharsky on Art T HE report of the Committee on the Costs of Medical Care , which Evans Clark discusses in this issue of The Nation , represents a significant warning which the medical profession can not afford to ignore . Certainly the profession must not take the attitude already adopted by the Journal of the American Medical Association . This organ of the medical societies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " and declares that it stands in the way of the present " gradual evolution " of medicine in this country . Such a superficial judgment is bound to do harm . A careful study of the committee 's recommendations convinces us that they constitute anything but an " incitement to revolution . " In fact , the report presents abundant evidence that the " gradual evolution " of which the Journal speaks , can only result in still further increasing " the perplexing problem of providing adequate medical care for all persons at costs within their means . " Obviously , if it becomes increasingly difficult for most of the people to meet their doctors ' bills , the present system must be considered detrimental to the economic interests of the physicians and dentists themselves . There are only two alternatives to this really dangerous tendency  --  the profession can upon its own initiative reform the present system of medical care , or the state can step in and take over that task . This is the issue which the committee 's report presents squarely and frankly to the medical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dentists . If conditions in the medical field are not soon improved , a widespread demand for the socialization of medicine is certain to develop . Then it may be too late to think of the sensible and practical plan which the committee has now put at the disposal of the profession . The plan may not be ideal , but certainly the deficiencies and inequities it may contain can be worked out and got rid of more quickly under the control of the profession than under the control of the state . Under the projected scheme laymen and government officials would be concerned only with financial and similar administrative matters . The doctors would have authority over the personnel of the medical centers and full jurisdiction in all questions of professional and scientific import . In its editorial the Journal of the American ' Medical Association accuses several members of the committee of having displayed personal bias in preparing the report . If this means that these members have had the courage to act upon their convictions , it is doubtless true . But if it means that they have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ committee devoted to its study of the problem , the accusation falls to the ground . The editorial does not charge the doctors of medicine on the committee with prejudice . Yet a majority of them , after participating in the study and thereby acquainting themselves with all the available facts , indorsed the committee 's plan . At the very least the medical societies and their spokesmen would be acting wisely and in their own best interests if they were to emulate their representatives on the committee and acquaint themselves with all the facts before passing judgment . Their haste in denouncing the report before they have had a chance really to digest it only betrays their own prejudice . OTH here and abroad Communist circles continue to be agitated concerning the attitude which their mem- bers ought to take toward literature . Thus in the New Masses for November Lunacharsky discusses Marxiim and Art , while in the New York Herald Tribune Books Louis Fischer writes at length on the dissolution of RAPP ( the Association of Proletarian Writers ) , and predicts a new era in contemporary Russian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lunacharsky 's article may doubtless be considered ' as semi-official , and the most interesting thing about it is the way in which it manages to leave a very wide door ajar while appearing at the same time to maintain the most unimpeachable orthodoxy . Art , he says , always involves an ideology and that ideology always grows out of the dominant social realities . For this reason art itself becomes a social force by supplying the banners around which a special class gathers . Marxism is itself the ideology of a definite class  --  the proletariat . Marxism is the only ideology which does no violence to reality . This is due to the fact that the proletariat is the class of the future . . . . A Marxist talent distinguishes itself by the fact that the acuteness of its reactions is specifically colored . Such a talent reacts with particular sensitivity to everything which has a direct connection with the great contemporary struggle . . .. A really great Marxist writer carries within himself an enormous arsenal of idealism , a colossal mass of bitterness and contempt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of fighting spirit . Nothing in all this could fail to please the most orthodox Communist , and , indeed , if it be accepted merely as a description of the working principles of a school of writers , nothing in it need be objected to by any student of literature no matter what his attitude may be toward the ordinary Communist contention that this school is the only one which has a right to exist . But Lunacharsky writes another innocent-sounding paragraph which the Calvinist of communism might well read with alarm : It is possible to find a decadent work of art a marvelous combination of color , line , or sound ; it is possible to find in a degenerate work of art something which - is very useful from the technical point of view . Similarly , in a monumental building permeated with the slave-holding spirit of some despot we may find magnificent proportions which are the product not only of despotism but also of the mightiest forms of mass-organization . The Marxist can thus learn something from every work of the past ... It is obvious , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ works of the past . He may learn from them and he may learn also  --  it would at least appear  --  from equally decadent works of the present . But if this principle be granted , then the Communist may range through all literature as freely and joyously as ' the veriest aesthete if he will only remind himself from time to time that he is doing so for a good Communist purpose . It was exactly thus that the Christian church solved the problem of classical literature , and it was because it did solve it in this way that the church became the preserver of the great pagan classics .
