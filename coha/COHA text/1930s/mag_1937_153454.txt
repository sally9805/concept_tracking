In South Portland , Me. last week Veterinarian John Francis Ford told what happened when he transplanted a tomcat 's sex glands to a rheumatic 14-year-old shepherd dog . " In two weeks , " said Dr. Ford , " the rejuvenation took effect . The dog went wild . He was full of pep . He was all over the place . I never saw anything like it . He wagged his tail so hard that he knocked three loose rungs out of my front stairs banister . Twice I locked him in a cage outdoors . Both times he broke loose . Then I tied him . He chewed himself free . He was too much for us . About a month ago we had to destroy him . " <P> In Buffalo , N. Y. last fortnight Frederick L. Schoeptlin 's neighbors complained to police of his Doberman pinscher 's night-time barking . A judge threatened a $100 fine if the offense were repeated . Owner Schoeptlin took his dog to a veterinarian , had it debarked by a simple nicking of its vocal chords @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's chief emotional outlet . Last week Buffalo 's indignant S. P. C. A. concluded after careful study that the operation was not illegal , launched a campaign for a State law forbidding it .
