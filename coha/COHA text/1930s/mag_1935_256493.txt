Oldest department store in Philadelphia is Strawbridge &; Clothier , established in 1862 by Quaker Justus C. Strawbridge who was joined by Quaker Isaac H. Clothier . The founders did a rushing business in Quaker shawls &; bonnets which Strawbridge &; Clothier still sells today . Only once in 73 years has it ever lost money . That was the year ( 1932 ) it opened its 14-story Market Street skyscraper , Philadelphia 's most modern store . More conservative than Gimbel 's , second only to Wanamaker 's in total sales , Strawbridge &; Clothier prides itself on a long list of innovations . It sent out the first typewritten bills in 1900 . It dared to stop giving discounts to clergymen in 1919 . It was Philadelphia 's first store to install airconditioning , first to establish branches in the city 's rich &; regal suburbs where the Strawbridges and the Clothiers have long been socialites . It was first to adopt an efficiency filing system by which its 125,000 charge accounts are photographed with a motion picture camera and the films stored in a single @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ news with another innovation . <P> In a series of full-page newspaper advertisements the store announced that as of May 31 it was giving a 2% discount on cash sales , a 1% discount on bills paid within 30 days . " It costs a store money to carry charge accounts , " said President Herbert James Tily , " and somebody has to pay it . ... We are happy to extend credit and we shall continue to do that . But we feel that it is a discrimination against the cash customer and the customer who meets his obligations promptly to assess them part of the cost of maintaining the credit structure . ... It is time someone undertook this much-needed reform . "
