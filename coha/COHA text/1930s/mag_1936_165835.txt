Crying " Make the Most of Yourself ! " last May , Street &; Smith 's young women 's magazine Mademoiselle began a series of articles on beauty and charm . One of its most interested readers was a 21-year-old Boston nurse named Barbara E. Phillips , who wanted to go on the stage . Miss Phillips , who considered herself a very plain girl , was sufficiently impressed to sit down at her typewriter , compose a long , yearning letter to the magazine . To Mademoiselle 's editors Barbara Phillips announced that , though she also read Vogue , Harper 's Bazaar and the Atlantic Monthly , and could identify such widely assorted characters as Vincent van Gogh , Beatrice Lillie and Princes Natalie Paley , she still stood in need of advice on " how to do my hair , powder my nose , cultivate sex appeal and walk a straight line . " <P> " I am as homely as a hedgehog , " said this frank reader , " my only good feature being my blue eyes . . . . Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if you could be the one who changed this very ugly duckling into even a pale pink swan ? If you have any of Pygmalion in you , please be a sport and help me out . " <P> Regarding this communication as by far the most interesting and intelligent of the 5,000-odd which the beauty series evoked from readers . Editor Desmond Hall at first suspected it might be a clever trap set by a rival magazine . Contributing Editor Helen Josephy , in charge of the beauty articles , invited Nurse Phillips to Mademoiselle 's , Manhattan office . Convinced of the young lady 's good faith , the editors decided to take a sporting chance and see what could be done about her personal appearance in one week 's time . Thus was launched a heroic course of beauty treatments and a smart circulation and merchandising stunt . <P> This week , in The Story of Barbara , the magazine describes the measures taken to transform homely Barbara Phillips into glamorous Barbara Phillips ( see cuts ) . First a professional make-up man , Paramount 's Edward Sigmund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Phillips to a dentist to have two protruding teeth " capped , " to Columbia University for a voice test , to a wigmaker for a flattering , readymade wig to cover her short , scraggly hair . A dress designer conceived a special frock to " soften the neckline . " Make-up Man Senz " deepened " Miss Phillips ' bulgy eyes with dark brown " shadow , " made her nose look smaller , penciled in wide-curved eyebrows , applied long artificial eyelashes . Stepping back from his work with satisfaction , " Eddie " Senz tweaked the nurse 's nose and chuckled : " Phillips , you 're looking swell ! " Most of the beautifying tricks were temporary , could be made permanent with more careful work . <P> Last week Miss Phillips was back in Boston , looking once more the way God made her . Meanwhile , her beautifying had not only made a story for the current Mademoiselle , but a trade circular sent out by the magazine to incipient advertisers of cosmetics . It was also announced that copies of Miss Phillips ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Cinderella Dress . "
