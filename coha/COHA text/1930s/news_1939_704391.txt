txt Henry L. Doherty , a leader in the oil industry , president and founder of the Cities Service Company and philanthropist , died of bronchial pneumonia at 9:41 o'clock tonight in his apartment at Temple University Hospital , where he had been a patient for three and a half years . His age was 69 . Mr. Doherty had suffered from arthritis since 1927 , and had been coming to the hospital periodically since 1930 . Eventually , his condition became such that he had a special apartment provided on an upper floor , where he had spent his time since 1936 , leaving the hospital only twice for one-day trips during that time . Dr. Charles Leonard Brown , Professor of Medicine at Temple University , Mr. Doherty 's attending physician , said he had been ill of pneumonia for two weeks . At his bedside were his wife , his adopted daughter and W A. Jones , executive vice president of the Cities Service Company .

He kept at work until he was stricken with pneumonia . Planned Roosevelt Birthday Balls From his bed he directed plans for Roosevelt birthday balls all over the country to aid infantile paralysis sufferers . In November , 1937 , he received from the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers the Anthony F. Lucas gold medal for distinguished achievement in improving the practice of finding and producing petroleum . Earlier in the same year Temple University conferred upon Mr. Doherty the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws . He stood erect in his hospital room while Dr. Charles E. Beury , president of the university , placed the academic hood over his shoulders . Mr. Doherty in 1938 was elected to the Temple University board of trustees . When Mr. Doherty first entered the specially arranged suite on the fourth floor of the hospital for his prolonged stay it was said he was suffering from a throat ailment . He was placed under the care of Dr. Brown , Dr. Chevalier Jackson , bronchoscope expert , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ School of Medicine . Physicians had virtually despaired of his life during his illness from arthritis in 1927 , and his friends at that time urged him to give up business . After an enforced rest , however , he was back at his desk , busy with the work of his utilities empire . He had been in the hospital for several weeks before his presence there became known , since he had entered it under an assumed name . Reports that he was a patient were denied repeatedly at the institution and tonight word of his death was announced first in New York . Began Career as Newsboy Henry L. Doherty began business life as a newsboy in Columbus , Ohio , the city of his birth . With his tediously earned pennies he learned his first lesson in thrift , and it was to thrift and to work that he attributed his business success . As president of the Cities Service Company , parent of nearly 200 oil , traction . light , gas and power subsidiaries throughout the country . Mr. Doherty headed an organization with total @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market crash in 1929 his fortune was estimated at $200,000,000 . His associates often tried to persuade him to slacken his pace and disengage himself from his vast business enterprises for the sake of his health , and sometimes he tried to follow their advice . But his vacations he frequently terminated after a few hours or days because of his eagerness to get back into harness . Lived in Financial District . In order to be near his business . to save valuable time which he thought others lost when they traveled to and fro on subways and otherwise . Mr. Doherty established his home in the financial district . He solved the problem of keeping close to his daily affairs by living within a stone 's throw of his office . He fitted out a luxurious apartment on the roof of 24 State Street after he had bought that property . and equipped it among other things with a motor bed , which he moved on a track in and out of the apartment for outdoor sleeping by pressing an electric button . Later he made his home at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a modest old-fashioned building diagonally opposite Fraunces Tavern . On floors above him he could hear the shuffling feet of customs clerks and other salaried workers who had rooms in the building . But he liked the atmosphere , because when the wheels of the financial district were stilled and the multitudes of workers had gone home at dusk that section was deserted and its solitude appealed to him . Mr. Doherty owned not only the building in the financial district where he made his home but the building at 60 Wall Street . where were his offices . He bought the latter building in 1924 for a price said to have been close to $3,000,000 , and at the time of - the purchase he told how he had rented two small rooms in the same building when he came to New York in 1906 . His Florida Enterprizes His real estate holdings were enormous ; his plans for their development even more grandiose . He acquired a chain of palatial hotels in Florida , linked them with an air taxi service , sponsored dozens of athletic competitions and did everything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The aggressive development methods of Mr. Doherty received a major share of the credit for reviving the tourist business in Florida after the depression . His principal Florida holding was the Miami-Biltmore Hotel , a $10,000,000 resort property in Coral Gables which includes a golf course and swimming pools , built in the boom days . Its management Mr. Doherty turned over largely to his publicity agents , a policy that led to the inauguration of the annual $10,000 Miami-Biltmore open golf tournament which brings the brigade of professional stars to Coral Gables every year . His most magnificent dream was his plan for the development of a great , independent business centre , rivaling Wall Street , around Battery Park . In the boom years Mr. Doherty and a group of associates purchased $3,000,000 in land there . They envisioned lofty buildings on the property , confident that they could rent the office space by telephone because of the existing building shortage . The depression spelled the doom of that project . The slump did not , however , halt the utilities magnate 's plan to erect at 70 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called it Sixty Wall Tower and it rose sixty-seven stories above the street . The structure represented an investment of $15,000,000 . His Spectacular Fight to Toledo . One of the most spectacular fights in which Mr. Doherty ever engaged was in the city of Toledo , Ohio . As the result of an ouster ordinance made effective by the voters in the election of November . .919 . Doherty , as president of the Toledo Railways and Light Company , moved the company 's trolley cars over into Michigan and etored them there . Citizens of Toledo calked or used buses for transportation for snore than a month until the City Council voted to shelve the ouster and came to an understanding with Mr. Doherty . Equally determined was his fight with Governor Harry H. Woodring of Kansas and The Kansas City Star . It began in July , 1931 , after the State Banking Department had barred all but one class of Cities Service ste'k from sale in Kansas . Mr. Doherty , in a bristling statement , charged that the action was precipitated by the refusal of Cities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their rates , in accordance with a request by Mr. Woodring . The utilities head addressed a 3,000-word telegram to the Postmaster General , asking that The Star , whose " evil influences " he held responsible for the Governor 's stand , be barred from the mails . This move failed but Mr. Doherty 's feelings were assuaged almost at once by a Kansas district court order temporarily - ; straining the Banking Department in enforcement of the ban . A few days later the same court held unconstitutional the law under which the , prohibition was imposed . Mr. Doherty pressed his advanL by filing a $12,000,000 libel suit against The Star , to which the paper retorted that it would not be frightened into abandoning its campaign " to get fair rates for domestic consumers in the cities of Kansas and Missouri . " A month after the battle began Mr. Doherty announced that he had purchased a half-interest in The Kansas City Journal-Post to , give him an " equal footing " with his foes . At the same time he sent a twenty-three-page letter to The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ replace them with " honorable , constructive men . " The next major engagement did not occur until-July , 1932 ? when to the State was granted a temporary injunction in a suit to enjoin the Doherty companies from selling Cities Service securities in Kansas . Four days later two suits asking damages totaling $42,000,000 were tiENRY L. JJOHEK ' 1'I filed against The Star and its management ? by Mr. Doherty and the Cities- Service Gas Company . This brought to $54,000,000 the total of suits against The Star , and its archenemy hinted that more were to come . Apparently nothing ever came of the threats or the suits , however . In April , 1933 , the Circuit Court at Kansas City - ' stained a demurrer of The Star in the $30,000,000 action brought by the gas company . After that there was only silence , so far as newspaper records show . Meanwhil. , on July 19 , 1932 , the Kansas Public Service Commission ended nine months of investigation and hearings by ordering slashes in the city gate gas rate , similar to those originally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the State Supreme Court affirmed the district court 's injunction against the sale of Cities Service stock . It held that the Doherty groups must obtain a sales permit . Five days later a temporary permit was issued by the . State Charter Board and the twenty-one-month battle was over . Another fight in which he figured was for control of the Pierce Oil Corporation in 1922 . Preferred stockholders launched a concerted movement against Doherty and appealed to the shareholders to wrest control from those in power , charging that Doherty was trying to get control because his own oil companies were not producing enough oil to keep his refineries going . In the same year Doherty led a fight on the mosquitos in Manhattan . He advanced the theory that they did not breed in New Jersey meadows and fly across the Hudson , but that they found breeding places-in the pools and other bodies of itagnant water on Manhattan Island itself .. His interest in the insect menace continued to manifest itself for many years thereafter . In 1933 he was the donor of the prizes awarded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tropical and Preventive Medicine for essays on the subject , " The Problem of Mosquitoes and Other Insects in Relation to Sanitation , Health and Industry . " Quit School at 10 Years . Henry L. Doherty was born- in Columbus , Ohio , on May 15 , 1870 , of Scotch-Irish parents . He quit school at the age of 10 to sell newspapers on the streets of . Columbus . Two . years later he became an office boy in the employment of the Columbus Gas and Electric Company . It was there , he always said , that he began his self-education by reading the company catalogues . He devoted every available minute to study of gas and electricity . He advanced gradually , and in 1890 began to move about in various capacities as engineer or manager of gas ; electric or traction companies in Madison , Wis. ; St. Paul , Minn. ; San Antonio , Texas , and Denver , Col. In 1905 he organized Henry L. Doherty &; Co. , bankers and operators of public utilities , and in 1910 the Cities Service Company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charge of his business enterprises and went to Washington to give his services to his country . Largely through his efforts the American Petroleum Institute was organized . Despite his lack of formal schooling , Mr. Doherty won wide respect among his associates for his mathematical and scientific knowledge . In 1930 the Franklin Institute awarded him the Walton Clark medal " in consideration of his outstanding and valuable work in the development of the manufactured gas-industry . " At that time he had more than 150 patents to his credit . On Dec. 31 , 1929 ; the 58-year-old utilities financier married Mrs. Percy Frank Eames , widow of an International Harvester Company official , who had nursed him through two years of illness . Mr. Doherty adopted Mrs. Eames 's 18-year-old daughter , Helen Lee Eames . The next year the Vice President and the Secretary of War were among 1,000 guests at the ball at which she was presented to Washington society . It was a time of widespread hunger and joblessness and Senator Norris assailed the party as an example of " a man scattering money around @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Mr. Doherty was a sufferer from rheumatism all his life . His serious illness in March , 1927 , was used as a pretext by professional traders to bring about a sensational break in the common stock of the Cities Service Company , of which he was president . At that time Mr. Doherty made a frank statement to the stockholders of his companies , announcing that he never expected again " to take an active part in the routine work " of the business . In the statement Mr. Doherty denied emphatically that the Cities Service Company was a " one-man concern " and insisted that his organization had been so perfected that it would function perfectly without him . He intimated that on account of his health it had become necessary for- him virtually to retire from active business and said that he was " still unable to ? conduct business in the ordinary way . " Five years later , however , Mr. Doherty was back in the traces , his characteristic vigor apparently unimpaired . Science unfolded a brand new marvel to signalize his return to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . His voice was harnessed to a moonbeam and broadcast over a national radio network . A few minutes later the moonbeam was made to vibrate again and trip a switch lighting the floodlights atop Sixty Wall Tower . Postmaster General Walter F. Brown . brought the greetings of President Hoover on that occasion . Mr. Doherty derived the greatest satisfaction from ' the results of his five-year fight for a program of oil conservation , known as " unit operation " of each new pool . From his sick bed at Johns Hopkins Hospital and his temporary home in sanitariums in various parts of the country he bombarded government officials , officers of oil companies and members of the American Petroleum Institute with recommendations for conservation by means of " unit operation " until his efforts were crowned with victory on Dec. 11 , 1927 , when the American Petroleum Institute adopted this program . For many months Mr. Doherty made a lone fight to arouse interest in his plan to conserve oil and eliminate waste in the industry . His health failed and he was obliged to continue his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ideas were rejected by other leaders of the oil industry and the dismite waxed long and furious . Under the Doherty plan of " unit operation " oil would not be extracted . as at present , by numerous surface - landowners , each eager to get the most oil out of the land . The pool would be operated by a single agency , representing all the land owners and taking out oil no taster than needed . " 011 Business Basically Wrong . " In c-lling the attention of the FIc1-1 ei al Oil Conservation Board to thel ti emendous waste in the industry through untrammeled drilling operations in the prolific pools . Mr. Doherty gave it as his opinion that " the oil business is basically wrong and can never be made right until w can provide a dependable , even production of oil . To do this we must change the laws under which we work in the oil industry and make these- laws the same as pertain to all - other classes of property . " Arguing against his critics who opposed any governmental attempt to control oil @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ each surface landowner raced to get the maximum share of oil which really belonged in common to all who were situated over the pool . This resulted in overproduction ; more wells were drilled than were needed . valuable natural gas was blown off into the air and carried with it huge quantities of helium gas  --  a valuable war necessity . The only solution he saw was the enforcement of " unit pool operations . " He maintained that the laws respecting petroleum should be changed so that ownership of oil would vest in common in all of the land situated over a pool and that no owner should have the right to drill independently . Thus , an orderly development of each pool would be assured and a maximum recovery of oil . Nature , he said , made these pools units , and it was therefore impossible to operate them economically and efficiently except as units . Mr. Doherty had little patience with those who argued that a Federal oil regulatory law would be unconstitutional because it would tal 3 away the constitutional rights of the landowner to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , however , with legal opinion at his command , that no man could insist on being allowed to use his property in a way which was injurious to the property of his neighbor . Drift Toward Unit Drilling . To demonstrate the sincerity of his view , Mr. Doherty in 1929 offered the American Bar Association $120,000 to be used for charity in the event that a committee named by it failed to sustain his contention that the government did have the right to legislate against further waste of oil . By this time observers noted a growing disposition in many sections of the oil industry for unit drilling along cooperative lines . But this drift toward acceptance of the unit method did not heal the breach between Mr. Doherty and other leaders in the industry , for he soon found himself disagreeing with their ideas on the means of carrying it out . In . June , 1931 , he proclaimed himself hopelessly " out of step " with his fellows and presented his resignation from the board of directors of the American Petroleum Institute , in the founding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thereafter to press for Federal legislation to integrate production methods . When such measures came , however , with the Oil Code and other New Deal legislation , he found them considerably more sweeping than he had desired . There was something plaintive in the statement which the veteran fighter issued in August , 1933 : " After having been abused and ridiculed for years , " he said , in part , " because I held that it was within the power of the Federal Government to legislate to prevent the waste of oil and gas , I now look with dread to the possibility of controversy with those who would have the Federal Government exercise powers that I never dreamed were in the minds of anybody , and powers which I believe would be most repugnant to any one of the men who had a part in framing our present Constitution . " In this and in other matters which have preceded this controversy in other fields where I have advocated something new and something I believed to be right , I have had my ideas eventually taken up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Admired F. D. Roosevelt . Although a foe of some New Deal policies , Mr. Doherty expressed keen admiration for President Franklin D. Roosevelt . He served as chairman of the 1934-35-36-37 national coma ittees for the President 's Birthday Ball , which sponsored a series of dances throughout the country each of those years on Jan. 30 , the President 's birthday , for the benefit of infantile paralysis sufferers . In the first three years receipts were more than $1,000,000 each time . In 1936 it was estimated that more than 5,000,000 persons danced at the balls in 6,000 cities and towns . In a deposition filed in Federal court in October , 1936 , Mr. Doherty , in defending himself in a stockholders ' suit , expressed the opinion that President Roosevelt would win the 1936 election and that a Republican President could not be expected to straighten out tangled industrial situations . He defended holding complies , which had been the target of the New Deal , as a key to prosperity and re-employment . He explained that he did not wish to fight Mr. Roosevelt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I can , " he wrote , " and if I can not , I want to try to convince him of my position . So I am just trying to please . " I have never gotten on terms of intimacy with him , but I have not found him a bull-headed man , and if he had time I think he would be - willing to listen . " In February , 1935 , when the introduction of a bill to abolish utilities holding companies challenged the corporate  --  structure he had built up , Mr. Doherty lashed at the proposal in a letter to Cities Service securities holders . So vigorous was his condemnation that Senator Wheeler , chief proponent of the measure , threatened to call Mr. Doherty before the Senate Commerce Committee to answer for what he termed an attempt to " terrify " stockholders into writing bushels of protest letters . Later in 1935 it was shown before the Senate Lobby Investigating Committee that the Cities Service Company spent about $200,000 in its /campaign to defeat the WheelerRayburn bill , which became the Public Utility Act @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any expenses incurred for the same purpose by the company 's subsidiaries . Also that year the company brought suit to challenge the act 's constitutionality . The depression and the attendant demand in many quarters for simplification of the nation 's business set-up had already brought some changes in the Doherty organizations . One of the most notable was the decision in July , 1933 , of Henry L. Donerty &; Co. to discontinue the sale directly to the public of the securities of Cities Service and its subsidiaries . This step was taken , it was announced , in accordance with the intent and spirit of the new Securities Act : " That the sale of securities to the public should be handled by those engaged in that single line of activity , with no interest in the issuing company which might influence their recommendations . " An independent company was organized by former Doherty employes to handle the securities of Cities Service and its affiliates . In 1928 Mr. Doherty was listed in the Directory of Directors as a director of 108 corporations and in 1936 as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Directors he was listed as a director of ninety-five corporations and in the 1937 edition as a director of sixtyfive . He was a member of the Democratic Club of New York , also the Lawyers and Lotos Clubs , and among out-of-town clubs he was a member of the Denver Club , Denver , Col. ; Minnesota Club . St. Paul , Minn . ; Commercial Club . Lincoln , Neb. , and Columbus Club , Columbus , Ohio .
