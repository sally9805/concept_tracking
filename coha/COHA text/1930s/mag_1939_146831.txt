Few months ago the pinwheel brain of U. S. industry 's most whimsical and unpredictable inventor threw out another spark . Convinced that what the U. S. needs and wants is a good , low-cost , small plane , mop-haired , 59-year-old William Bushnell Stout decided to re-enter aviation . Already mocked-up last week in his faded yellow Stout Engineering Laboratories in Dearborn , Mich , was a snug two-seater slated for mass production at about $3,000 . ( Specifications : four cylinder , 75-h.p. motor , 450-mile cruising range , tricycle landing gear , controls so limited that the pilot will not be able to pull the ship high enough for a tail spin ) . By next spring , Inventor Stout announced , his new planes will be rolling off the assembly line at the rate of one a day . <P> An aviation pioneer , Inventor Stout comes of pioneering stock . Boldest invention of the American Revolution was his ancestor David Bushnell 's tiny submarine that resembled two tortoise shells glued together , was dubbed " Bushnell 's Turtle " ( see p. 33 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heads over a contraption as outlandish as " Bushnell 's Turtle , " a fat monoplane that was mostly wing . To their surprise the " Batwing " not only established a new construction principle ( internally braced wings ) , but became the first U. S. commercial monoplane . Thenceforth Inventor Stout , unlike his frustrated ancestor , found backers for other queer-sounding projects . <P> Born in Quincy , Ill. , son of a Methodist minister , William Bushnell Stout early developed a talent for whittling ingenious gadgets . After studying engineering at the University of Minnesota , he left with $85 in his jeans , grubbed along as manual training instructor , toy designer , vaudevillian , journalist . In 1906 he married a Miss Alma Raymond , with his own deft hands built their St. Paul home and every stick of furniture in it , took a rattlebang honeymoon trip through Europe on a motorcycle . <P> Back in St. Paul young Stout , long a worshipper of such oldtime airmen as Octave Chanute and Glenn Curtiss , waded ear-deep into aviation . In 1922 , heartened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he drafted plans for the first all-metal commercial plane . To some 100 U. S. industrialists went Inventor Stout , asked them for $1,000 each . Said he : " You may never get your money back , but you 'll have $1,000 worth of fun . " <P> Many a bigwig forked up the ante , among them Henry Ford , who invited Inventor Stout to set up shop under his wing . As Ford protege , later as an independent , Inventor Stout : 1 ) built the famed Ford tri-motor plane , 2 ) organized one of the first commercial airlines ( Detroit-Cleveland , Detroit-Chicago ) , 3 ) designed the " Scarab , " first U. S. rear-engine car on the market , 4 ) designed one of the first high-speed , gasoline-driven streamliners , 5 ) netted more than $1,000,000.
