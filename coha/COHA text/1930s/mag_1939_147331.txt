Carry me back to old Virginny , <P> There 's where the cotton and the corn and tatoes grow , <P> There 's where the birds warble sweet in the springtime , <P> There 's where the old darkey 's heart am long 'd to go . <P> In 1875 a dapper young Negro minstrel-show man named James A. Bland penned these words , wrote a tune to go with them , and launched one of the most perennially popular of U. S. songs . Carry Me Back to Old Virginny was sung so long &; loud that 63 years later the Virginia Conservation Commission wanted it made Virginia 's official State anthem . Few singers of the song knew or cared who wrote it . If the question ever came up , someone usually said it was one of famed U. S. Songwriter Stephen Foster 's ( Swanee River , Oh ! Susanna ! etc . ) . Fame never caught up with black Songwriter Bland , but death did : in 1911 he was buried in an unmarked pauper 's grave in a corner of Merion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Last year Philadelphia 's pink and twinkly Music Publisher James Francis Cooke , whose Oliver Ditson Music Co. had turned many a penny publishing Songwriter Bland 's bestseller , began to wonder who James A. Bland really was . In vain he consulted the heftiest musical encyclopedias . Even Ditson 's oldest officials had no recollection of any James A. Bland . <P> In Washington , D. C. sleuthing Publisher Cooke found his first hot trail . At neat Negro Howard University he met a bent , white-haired mathematics professor , Dr. Kelly Miller , who told him that Bland had been survived by two sisters . One of them , a seamstress , thought she remembered where Bland had been buried and the number on his gravestone . Two months ago , after poking about among the headstones in Merion 's old cemetery , Publisher Cooke found Bland 's grave : a small mound covered with weeds and poison ivy . <P> Fortnight ago , on Emancipation Day , a large group of Negro celebrities gathered at this forlorn spot , listened to a flowery oration by Publisher Cooke , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Carry me back . . . . " Among the singers : famed Negro Blues Composer William Christopher Handy , Composer J. Rosamond ( brother of James Weldon ) Johnson . Meanwhile spontaneous contributions for a James Bland Memorial began to pile up in Publisher Cooke 's Philadelphia office . It looked as if James Bland 's grave might soon have something better on it than poison ivy .
