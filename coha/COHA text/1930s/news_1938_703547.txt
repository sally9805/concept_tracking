txt James J. Hines , powerful Tammany District Leader , had started his crucial attack today upon the elaborate case of Thomas E. Dewey , District Attorney for New York County , with an assault upon the State 's wiretapping evidence and upon a S50t check , the prosecution 's sole document in support of the charge that Mr. Hines actually received any payoff from the $20.000,000-a-year policy racket . Following Justice Ferdinand Pecora 's denial of his motion to dismiss the case against his client , Lloyd Paul Stryker , defense counsel , buckled down to the defense case , well aware that the trial must now go to final decision by the " blue ribbon " jury . His first witness was J. Howard Haring , handwriting expert , who testified that the name " J. Hines " on the check alleged to have been delivered to Mr. Hines by the racket was squeezed in between the names of J. Richard Davis and Eddie Holly . after the last indorsement had been written in . Debate on Handwriting Mr. Dewey fought desperately and against an obdurate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than an hour the paramount issue became whether or not the down loop of the letter " j " was superimposed upon the " e " or contrariwise . Mr. Haring had discoursed learnedly and with the aid of laboratory equipment on his theory that the " j " overlay the " e . " Mr. Dewey , however , elicited from the witness the admission that because of the optical illusion created when two pieces of writing intersect , the determination of which comes first is one of the most difficult problems for the handwriting expert and that in the final analysis the decision becomes a matter of opinion . The witness plainly resented Mr. Dewey 's challenge of his judgment and at one point asked : " Are you an expert , Mr. Dewey ? " It began to look as if that was precisely what Mr. Dewey was . He developed that it is a rule of the writing experts that the ink from the last letter written flows , into the first letter and Mr. Dewey then pointed to three places where the " j " intersected @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ink flowed from the " e " into the " j , " thus establishing " j " as the first letter written . Mr. Haring stuck to his version that these three splotches of ink resulted from " rhythmic pressures " characteristic of the person who wrote " J. Hines . " Prosecution 's Contention The prosecution has admitted that the signature is not in the handwriting of Mr. Hines , but it does contend that the indorsement was made for Mr. Hines ; that Mr. Hines got the $500 denominated by the check , and that the signature was written in its proper order on the back . Mr. Haring also presented testimony that assailed the State 's wiretapping evidence . Julius Salke , a detective in the employ of the Treasury Department , had sworn that he took down telephone conversations overheard on Davis 's wire , one of which was between Davis and a man named " Jim . " Mr. Haring had examined the paper upon which Mr. Salke had testified he copied down the conversation and declared it could not have been written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ written under those circumstances would show great haste ; that the letters would degenerate into illegibility ; that the structure of the writing would tilt toward the right and that the punctuation would be faulty . He testified that the document introduced by the state had none of these characteristics ; that the words were all legible ; that the punctuation was virtually perfect ; that the writing structure actually leaned backward to the left , and that there were other peculiarities that would indicate the document had been written in a leisurely manner totally at odds with the demands imposed upon one hastily scribbling down a telephone conversation . Dewey Cross-Examines Mr. Dewey , in his attack upon this part of Mr. Haring 's testimony , elicited merely the facts that the handwriting expert had never before examined a memorandum of this sort written by a Federal Agent and that there had been a pause in the telephone conversation while the " boss " was called to the phone . By centering attack first upon the tangible and documentary evidence adduced by the State , the defense indicated that its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the outset and a subsequent attack upon the remainder of the State 's case as hearsay , conspiracy among perjured witnesses and as a fabric of mistaken identity upon the part of the unimpeachable witnesses who had testified . Dewey 's Political Future By a Staff Correspondent of The Christian Science Monitor DUNKIRK , N. Y. , Sept. 10 ?

" Mr. Dewey 's whole political future is dependent upon the outcome of the Hines case , " Mr. said when asked for comment on the political situation .
