In the meeting room of the House Naval Affairs Committee stands a screen made from panels of the old U. S. S. Illinois , a table fashioned from the windlass top of the Maine , a glass case containing models of airplanes . Atop the glass case rides an 18-in. model of the U. S. S. Akron . The Akron model was almost buried one day last week by the carelessly strewn hats &; overcoats of Committee members who sat in silence around the big horseshoe table . Facing the Committee from a small table at the mouth of the horseshoe stood a stocky , curly-haired young man in an open-necked Navy blouse , with the crossed white anchors of a bos'n 's mate on his sleeve . He was Richard Deal , survivor of the crash of the Shenandoah and one of three survivors of the 76 who sailed on the U. S. S. Akron 's last voyage . Gesticulating now &; then with his bandaged right hand , he read from a sheaf of typewritten papers . <P> Bos'n 's Mate Deal detailed what he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from Lakehurst at 7:30 p. m . April 3 , bound for the New England coast . He related his last conversation with Rear Admiral William Adger Moffett , the most distinguished victim of the disaster : <P> " He asked me if I was on watch . I said ' Yes , sir . I have the telephone at this station . ' He stopped on the first step leading down the gangway to the control car and I said ' Admiral , you must like flying on this ship . ' He replied ' I am very fond of it ; much more so than the other ( meaning HTA , * I assume ) . ... It is much better than the Shenandoah . ' I replied ' Yes , sir ' and he then proceeded to the control car . " <P> In the hour before midnight the Akron was being buffeted severely by a thunderstorm . Bos'n 's Mate Deal went about his business of taking ballast readings , carrying out ominous orders to shift ballast and fuel forward . At his next bit of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It was five minutes past twelve when I laid down on my bunk in the outer keel . I happened to be looking up and noticed the No. 7 cell was swishing quite more than usual . While looking at this cell the ship gave a terrific lurch sideways and longitudinal girders 7 &; 8 gave way as well as some of the wires . . . . About five or ten seconds before she crashed the lights went out in the keel . I ... heard a noise aft and then water hit my feet . . . . " <P> The Committee heard the remainder of Deal 's story : how he swam to a floating gas tank to which three other men were clinging ; how they struggled to keep the open spout of the tank above water ; how all hands shouted in unison to attract the lookout aboard the tanker Phoebus ; how Machinist 's Mate Rutan weakened and slipped into the sea and Radioman Copeland held on only to die later , while Deal and Metalsmith Moody S. Erwin were rescued . The Committee @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indication that the mighty Akron had buckled in the twisting storm before striking the water . And they thought back to a year ago when two men , E. C. McDonald and W. B. Underwood , onetime construction supervisor and mechanic on the Akron construction job , swore that the ship was deficient ; that she contained defective duralumin and hundreds of loose rivets .
