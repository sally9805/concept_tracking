At 4 p. m. one afternoon last week an air-raid alarm jarred Chungking . Return of fine weather had meant return of Japanese bombers , held off by three months of fog &; mist . Earlier in the week two raids in which 36 Japanese planes took part had set fires that were still burning , started a flight of refugees that was still going on . At 4:20 , 16 Chinese pursuit planes took off , disappeared in the smoky air . The remaining citizenry disappeared in caves and dugouts on Chungking 's hillsides , where they sweltered in the hot afternoon . <P> As dusk came , but no Japanese bombers , the dugouts emptied . For months Chungking merchants have done their business late in the afternoon , opening shop at 4 p. m. , in order to limit the danger from air raids . That night the life of the old grey-walled city , last capital of the Mings 300 years ago , third capital of Chiang Kaishek , again got back to a sort of wartime normal . Crowds swarmed down Dujugai , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to an estimated 2,000,000 in six months . Generalissimo Chiang and his wife inspected the areas bombed in the earlier raids . The power plant was functioning again . A Harvard graduate named Theodore White went to his room in the Canadian-French mission school . The Associated Press correspondent stepped out of his office . Suddenly , out of the leaden sky , at 6:30 , 27 Japanese bombers swept in on Chungking from the north . <P> The bombers , their red-disc insignia plain to their victims below , maneuvered into position . In the twilight , soon made more brilliant by a full moon , they divided , one formation concentrating over Dujugai , another heading for the city 's congested southern district , another concentrating on the hilltops where consulates are located . <P> Chungking is a gigantic anthill which sits where the Kialing joins the Yangtze River . Ancient , 100-ft. walls confine the old section of Chungking to five square miles of an eminence 150 ft. above the rivers . Inside walled Chungking the streets , now pitted with holes filled with water for fire prevention @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wooden buildings crammed with refugees and Government offices . Across its congestion Japanese bombers laid parallel lines of destruction , a mile and a half long , 500 yards wide . They dropped more than 100 bombs . <P> A bomb hit 60 feet from the Associated Press building . One crashed through the roof of the British Embassy &; Consulate . Another fell on the tennis court , killed 20 Chinese . The Canadian-French mission was demolished , the mangled body of a Chinese woman blown 200 yards through the window of Harvardman White 's room . A bomb struck the Chungking power station . Chungking 's radio went dead , the city 's lights went out . The home of the British Vice Consul was struck three times , and fires surrounded the German Embassy &; Consulate where , all night , the Consul General and his wife waited with cans of water to fight the flames . As morning came they watched helplessly while 100 Chinese , trapped against the base of the city wall outside their house , were burned to death .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
