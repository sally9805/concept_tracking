txt Joseph A. Broderick , State Superintendent of Banks , issued a brief statement yesterday that was generally taken as a reply to charges made Wednesday night by Max D. Steuer , attorney for a group of depositors of the suspended Bank of United States . " The Banking Department has been closely and constantly in touch with the affairs of this institution for fifteen months , " said Mr. Broderick . " The assets as called for by the books have been accounted for since the department has taken possession . " Mr. Steuer had asserted that " on the basis of September reports and the amount now said to have been found in its vaults , $112,000,000 disappeared between Sept. 24 and Dec. 11 , when the bank closed its doors . " He explained in a statement yesterday that this estimate was based on the hypothesis that the funds of the bank are sufficient to pay only 60 per cent of the deposits . No available figures Indicate any such drop in assets as that mentioned as possible by Mr. Steuer , bankers pointed out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . of the closed bank is the announcement by Mr. Broderick that net deposits at the time it was closed were $161,000,000 . This figure represents an apparent drop of $42,000,000 from the $203,000,000 deposits reported by the bank on Sept. 24 , but it was pointed out that the comparison is not accurate , since the earlier figure represents gross deposits and that given by Mr. Broderick net deposits . Statement by Max D. Steuer . Mr. Steuer 's statement follows : It is suggested that the Superintendent of Banks has given to the press a statement which he end the press representatives to whom it was given interpreted as being in conflict with statements made by me last evening . I wish it distinctly understood that I am not only . not seeking any controversy with the Superintendent of Banks but that on the contrary the executive committee of the organization which I represent is very anxious to ' work wholeheartedly , as am I , in cooperation with the superintendent . I naturally assumed that we had a common object . I am positive that the superintendent wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which I furnished last night , with the exception of one item , were all taken from the statement of condition issued by the Bank of United States on Sept. 24 , 1930s That statement is a matter of record . There can be no conflict about its contents . It states : Capital $25,250,000.00 Surplus 10,000,000.00 Undivided profits 7,156,375.16 Reserves for taxes , dividends , interest , &c.; 5,081,208.12 Total ; 47,487,583.28 Of these items , the only one that could have beenlegitimately used is the reserve item , and as to that there is no conflict that at , least $3,000,000 has not been used . So that it is conceded that $45,406 , - 375.16 was there on the 24th of September , 1930 . On the 11th of December . 1930 , the bank was closed . Are those items intact ? If they are , so much the better for the depositors . Surely they , are not hoping that it has been dissipated . If those item : : are intact , why was the bank closed ? It is a fact that thebank was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intact . No bank can have an unimpaired capital , an unimpaired surplus , unimpaired undivided profits , and still be closed by the Superintendent of Banks . So that the conclusion that those items have disappeared is inevitable . Unless you assume that they were not in existence on the 24th of September , 1930 , if they were not in existence on the day , then a fraud has been perpetrated upon every depositor who deposited since that day . I am in no position at this time to determine or to say whether or not those items existed on the 24th of September . 1930 . Up to this moment I have assumed that they did exist , and , therefore , was forced to the conclusion that they have disappeared .. The only other item that I spoke of , I mentioned hypothetically . I said if the funds in the bank at the present time are sufficient to pay the depositors , thank God for that ; but if it be true that there is only 60 per cent , then since it has been authentically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent of $160,000,000 is $96,000,000 . The difference between $96,000,000 and $160.000.000 is $64,000 , ( 100 . The $64,000,000 and the $48,000,000 previously mentioned constitute $112 , - 000,000 , which must be accounted for . Reducing that by $2,000,000 , properly.used of the reserve fund , there is missing $110,000.000 . After reading the statement issued by the Superintendent of Banks , that the Banking Department was closely and constantly in touch with the affairs of the institution for fifteen months , the assets as called for by the books have been accounted for since the department took possession , I have nevertheless been unable to change the figures given above . The figures do still speak for themselves . The statement made by the Superintendent of Banks is probably entirely accurate . What it means I do not know . I understand the meaning of every word used in the statement , but the whole statement conveys no information to me . I would like to know what the facts are so as to be able to tell them to the depositors . Does the statement mean @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the surplus is unimpaired , that the undivided profits item is unimpaired ? If so , it naturally means that the deposits are unimpaired . Then this bank is certainly in the most wonderful condition . Why put more than 400,008. people into a panic and close a bank if the bank is in this wonderful condition ? I wish to repeat again that I am not issuing this statement in order to create a controversy . At the depositors ' meeting , ' - the presiding officer , Judge Goldstein , and the members of the - executive committee expressed complete confidence in . the integrity of , the Superintendent of Banks . I shared in that expression . My opinion has not changed since last evening . In the resolution adopted , the Superintendent ' of Banks was highly commended . I voted for the resolution ? Before the press seeks to indicate to the public that there is any conflict between the Superintendent of Bank 's and myself , I would like the press to ascertain the answers to the questions that I /lave asked . It is perfectly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be complete . It is equally clear to me that some of the items of assets may be , of doubtful value .. But is it not perfectly clear that every member of the board of directors and the counsel for the bank must know whether or not the capital , surplus , undivided profits and reserves were as they were stated to ? be in the statement that was issued on ? - Sept. 24 , 1930 ? Why ca n't they make a statement as to whether or not those assets did exist , and if they did exist , what has become of them , and if they are intact , why was the bank closed ? I do not intend to discuss the operations of the directors or anything of that sort . I mean to lend , as I stated last night , every possible effort toward the reopening of this bank . It would come as a great blessing to the new year if that could be accomplished , and those who bring it about will have rendered a great public service . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to undermine , make small of or discredit the depositors . They have been sufficiently badly treated when the bank was so managed as to bring about its closing . If the bank has all its assets intact , let it at once reopen . If the assets have disappeared , let that fact be made clear . There should not be , and there must not be , any equivocation about this situation . Has Not Seen . Questions . Mr. Broderick said yesterday that he had not yet received the list of twenty-one questions drawn up at the depositors ' meeting in Brooklyn at which Mr. Steuer made his original assertion . In connection with the publication of the weekly statement of condition of reporting member banks of the Federal Reserve in New York City by the Federal Reserve Bank of New : York , it was revealed last night that the last report of the Bank of United States showed loans and investments of " about $190,000,000 . " This report was as of Dec. 10 , the last day on which the bank did business .. In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bank of United States listed loans and investments of $213 , - 7,16,000 , divided as follows : Bonds and other investments $42,069,000 Call and collateral loans 48,410.000 Discounts 123,237,000 Total $213,716,000 It is understood that the bank called in its brokers ' loans prior to its suspension as part of the measures taken to place itself in possession of cash . A large part of the $19,000,000 indebtedness of local member banks to the Federal Reserve Bank , reported a week ago , is understood to have represented discounts made by the Bank of the United StateN ; but the institution was not a borrower at the bank of issue until shortly before its closing . 7,371 Depositors Seek Loans . Applications for loans made by depositors of the closed bank at its fifty-nine banking offices yesterday totaled 7,371 , compared with 5,550 on Tuesday , the first day the plan went into operation , and 8,000 on Wednesday . Applications made on Tuesday , it was learned , were by depositors having aggregate net claims of $4,500,000 . Since virtually all applications are for the full 50 per cent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ twenty-three banks of the New York Clearing House . Association ' will be called upon for approximately $2,250,000 in satisfaction of the first day 's loan demands . Figures on the amount of loans applied for do not become available until the afternoon of the second day after the applications are received . The number of applications received to date , 20,921 , falls materially below what had been expected . Yesterday , it was said , a number of depositors who had applied for loans returned to the bank and asked to have their applications canceled . Officials in charge of the working of the plan remarked that the majority of depositors appeared satisfied to know that they could borrow , when and if they desired , and , safe in that assurance , were in no hurry to avail themselves of the privilege . Troubles Began With Stock Crash . Mr : Broderick 's statement that the Banking Department had been constantly in touch with the affairs of the Bank of United States for fifteen months Is in line with the understanding of bankers in Wall Street that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time of the stock market crash in October , 1929 . There were reports in the financial district in November , 1929 , that certain branches of the bank were experiencing heavy withdrawals , and at that time rumors of difficulties were current . One important banker said recently that , in his opinion , the affairs of the bank were actually in better shape at the time of its closing than they had been some months previously . He attributed this to the efforts Mr. Broderick had made in the period to improve the condition of the institution . Commenting on the statement , bankers remarked that the assertion that the assets as called for by the books had been accounted for did not necessarily mean that all these assets could be liquidated at book value . At the present time , it was pointed out , prices of all securities , including bonds of all but the highest calibre , are extremely depressed . *Idle real estate holdings and securities are hard to dispose of . Moreover , it was said , the actual markets quoted for many securities @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any large offerings at the present time . Mr. Steuer- conferred yesterday afternoon with Justice Louis Goldstein , chairman of the depositors ' protective committee . Meeting of Depositors Today . Mitchell Luftman , counsel for the Wilkins Avenue Neighborhood Association . 1,330 Southern Boulevard , the Bronx , announced that he had called a meeting of depositors for this afternoon at 2 o'clock in the Zion Hebrew Institute ; 806 Jennings Street , and that-it was his intention to warn depositors not to be stampeded by wild rumors and hysteria . " We should have implicit faith in Max D. Steuer 's assurance that the depsitors will get that money in full ? every dollar of it , " said Mr. Luftman . " If such is true , depositors can help the bank by drawing only enough money on their certificates to meet immediate needs . " Editorial Appeal Made . An appeal for their assistance in reorganizing the bank is made to Governor Roosevelt and Lieut . Gov . Lehman in an editorial this morning in The Day , a Jewish morning newspaper . After recalling the successful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ editorial says : " If this far-sighted and humanitarian course should be taken now it would not only save the situation for the 400,000 depositors but would restore the confidence of the whole nation in our banking institutions , which merit that confidence . " A group of about 700 depositors in the Delancey Street branch of the bank met last night at the Great Central Palace , 90 Clinton Street , and listened to speakers who urged that a committee be named to call on Mayor Walker and ask his cooperation In obtaining funds from the bank .
