txt Letters to the Editor QUALITY IN RADIO PROGRAM . Broadcasters Should Pay for All Participants to Improve Talent . To the Editor of The New York Times : There has been much discussion of late of the commercial side of radio aid the resultant quality or lack of quality in radio programs . I have followed the speeches for and against with not a little personal interest as one who for three years has broadcast regularly over one of the large national chains . And I think that a great deal that has been said has been right on both sides ; and more ? often confusing rather than illuminating . For instance , Mr. Aylesworth made the point that newspapers give 50 per cent of their space to news and 50 per cent to advertising , while radio gives only a third of its time to advertising He omitted to say that that third was in effect ' the most valuable time on the air ? the only time , in fact , worth much . On the other hand , at the recent Conference on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ charged the educators of the country with incompetence and unwillingness to avail themselves of space on the air offered them . Much of what he said was true  --  that educators too often considered dullness as a sign of worth , and are untrained in proper broadcasting . But these charges pro and con have befogged what seems to me the keynote of radio development . No one is willing to develop talents that will not bring in what talents originally meant ? money . We all have to live . The starved attic poet is now an anachronism . People have learned to make their writing pay . Advertising above all things put writing on a decent economic level . At least , the newspapers and the magazines saw - to it soon enough that their success depended on getting the best writers , and they were willing to pay for what they regarded as the best . But no magazine worth its salt , nor no newspaper , asks of its writers and its reporters that they contribute their writings for publicity only . They pay for material , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will publish . Not so the radio . The radio turns its " editorial " policy over to the advertising agency . The advertising agency determines the editorial policy of the " account . " The advertising agency is the editor , and so long as each account on the air is so conducted , so long as different advertising agencies broadcast regardless of the policy of any other agency , so long will there be chaos and mediocrity on the air . Magazines were made by editors . There is no such cohesive , centralizing spirit on the air . There is still another difficulty . Apart from the few headliners whose earnings are held dazzlingly before the starved rabble that fills the air ' with its talent , the radio does not pay . Musicians and actors may get paid . but speakers , readers , writers are all expected to contribute their knowledge and talent for what Mr. Aylesworth himself called doubtful publicity . They may give talks that are regarded by the radio as excellent , they nay be asked over and over again to give talks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ being paid for their work , and when they indicate that they have had all the publicity they want and now want a little cash or a proper place on the air , they are assured quite blandly that no sustaining programs are paid for because the radio has not set aside any money for its ' programs , which it announces to the public are not sponsored by any commercial interests . Not until radio pays for all its programs  --  sustaining as well as sponsored  --  can it expect to have decent talent on the air . SYDNEY GREENBIE . New York , May 28 , 1931 . Is " Americanization " Spreading ? To the Editor of The New York Times : Below is an extract from The Evening Standard of London : " * ? ? that there existed a striking similarity between the American and the German character . ? ? ? Correspondents asked me to retract so far-fetched a statement . Far from retracting I repeat , I elaborate , I reaffirm . - " Superficially , of course , the differences between the two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they are much the same . They are both tortured by an inferiority complex  --  the Germans endeavoring to reassure themselves by force and kultur , the Americans seeking self-confidence in big business and boost . " They both like speed , whether it be ' hustle ' or ' tempo ' : they both like noise , sky signs , quantity before quality , modern plumbing , hothouse as opposed to wild flowers , trams , Cactuses , boudoir psychology , music , acting and films . They are both herd-ridden nations , and they both possess a ' Colonial mentality . And if you are still unconvinced , then compare Broadway with the Kurfiirstendamm . " My only remark is that I , too , like modern plumbing , acting , music and films . Can it be possible that I am becoming Americanized ? BRITON . New York , May 29 , 1931 . Protesting the " Bombing . " To the Editor of The New York Times : It seems an outrage that bombs should land near apartment houses , awakening children and throwing , invends into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long time . An energetic protest , from the entire city should be made to prevent such an outrage in the future . Mrs. F. ADUER . New York , May 28 , 1931w NOT THE NYE COMMITTEE . Another Committee Inquired into the Alabama Senatorial Elections To the Editor of The New York Times : I venture , in the absence of Sena. tor Nye , to invite your attention to certain statements in an editorial appearing in your issue of May 28 , , which , from information I possess , appear to me to be erroneous . Your editorial says in part : " Fria Nye 's subcommittee , digging into the alleged iniquities of the Bankhead-Heflin contest for Senator , has examined the ballots in ten Alabama counties selected by Mr. Heflint , No evidence of fraudulent practices has been unearthed . " The ballots were not examined by the Nye committee . They were examined by the subcommittee , ( Senator Daniel 0 . Hastings , chairman ) of the standing committee of Privileges and Elections . The counties were selected by the subcommittee at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? amination revealed can hardly be said with truth to be lacking in eve . dente of fraudulent practices . Chairman Hastings 's decision to continue the examination into the ballot boxes from other counties , over the protest of Senator-elect Bankhead , serves as an indication that something was unearthed . Under a Senate resolution investigation of corrupt practices in the Alabama general election was made the duty of the Privileges and Elections Committee , with an appropriation of $3,5,000 for expenses . This is regarded as proper , because when a contest is brought , the case automatically goes to the committee that sits to hear the evidence . This is true in the Minnesota and North Carolina contest cases . This committee investigated in both these States , but , on the filing of contests , tacitly accepted the precedent that the standing committee supersedes a select committee . There is also evident an inaccuracy in your reference to the matter brought up by Senator Black . Our investigator issued a form letter in April addressed to certain candidates in Alabama asking as to the amount contributed by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inquiry was made as to expenditures of candidates in the primary election on their own behalf . Our investigator 's letter was based upon a resolution adopted by the State Democratic Committee Of Alabama for the primary election under the terms of which all candidates at the primary were assessed : " two per cent of the annual salary for one year of all candidates for State , district , circuit and national offices . " Use of the word " national " brought the matter within the purview of this committee . Data secured through this letter afforded information as to source of funds which might be used in the primary contest between Bankhead and Thompson . As will be apparent , this has no bearing upon the Bankhead-Heflin campaign of the general election in November . Also the figures obtained as to contributions of candidates , assessed 2 per cent of the first year 's salary , served for comparative purposes with the re ? port made to this committee by E. Pettus , chairman of the State Demo. cratic Committee of Alabama , and permitted checking up on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ funds . Pursuant to a request , made in writing by Senator Daniel 0 . Hastings , chairman of the subcommittee . and addressed to Chairman Nye of this committee , I have been instructed to make available to Chairman Hastings and his subcommittee all data , documents , reports and other information gathered by our investigators . This under a resolution adopted by unanimous vote of this committee , all members being present . This , I believe , fairly indicates the position and attitude of this committee . Before Senator Nye left for North Dakota this week he wrote to Senator Black at some length in reply to a letter from Senator Black expostu. lating against investigation of candidates other than those for the office of United States Senator . In his letter Senator Nye outlined the attitude of this committee and pointed to its position in the Alabama con. : test . JOHN ANDREWS . Washington , D. C. , May 29 , 1931 . Movies Harm Us Abroad . To the Editor of The New York Times : Ninety per cent of the motion pictures shown in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ foreign audiences accept these films ' as being true pictures of Amercians and American life . What are most of the plots ? Murders , shootings , stealing , bootlegging , racketeering , debauchery , infidelity and other crimes . Out movie magnates have not missed a single vice . With this unfaithful portrayal of American life can foreigners get a truthful view of their friends overseas or have respect for us ? We should all work for word-wide understanding , respect and friendship . The movies can and should be a powerful means to that effect . HENRY W. BROOKS , Jr . New York , May 31 , 1931 . Soviet Mental Processes . To the Editor of The New York Times : Your editorial " Soviet Newspapers " contains enlightment and guidanee for the misguided leaders of the Russian people , and to many who , like Mr. Dreiser , are similarly misguided among our own people . Nevertheless , your correspondent 's thought is incompletely expressed , namely , that in a country where people 's thoughts are inculcated by the government , there the people can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but are enslaved to thoughts which are their own only by compulsion .
