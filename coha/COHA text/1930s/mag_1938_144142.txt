Ten years ago a Frenchified Russian , Dr. Serge Voronoff , and a Kansan who almost became Governor of his State , Dr. John Richard Brinkley , made fame &; fortune by grafting monkey and goat glands into decrepit males . Later a Viennese , Dr. Eugen Steinach , finding gland grafts useless , got beneficial results by a small operation which prevented the gradual loss of male hormones , which make men virile . But the real advance in man 's age-old search for virility began only : 1 ) when Dr. Adolf Butenandt of Germany , after treating 62,500 gallons of urine , succeeded in crystallizing one two-thousandths of an ounce of male sex hormone called " androsterone " ; 2 ) when Leopold Ruzicka of Switzerland manufactured a similar substance " testosterone " from the fat of sheep 's wool ( TIME , Sept. 2 , 1935 ) . <P> With a supply of testosterone , Drs . Samuel Alexander Vest &; John Eager Howard of Johns Hopkins a year ago began to administer the substance to : 1 ) men who were undersexed because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ virility had been destroyed by disease . By last week they had enough evidence to warrant a preliminary report : <P> All patients improved , achieved or regained manhood . One felt like " fighting wildcats . " But these benefits continued only during the administration of the hormone . Drs . Vest &; Howard cautiously warned : " It is only a substitution therapy , and certainly in instances of marked hypogonadism under-functioning of the sex organs it must be given continuously for sustained effect . . . . These clinical results can be regarded as being entirely in an experimental phase . "
