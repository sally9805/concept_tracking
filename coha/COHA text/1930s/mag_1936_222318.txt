The second important event of London 's social season took place last week with the annual Royal Academy exhibition in Burlington House. * The elderly , well-bred gentlemen who pick the pictures showed in the 1,600 they had chosen that modernists ' angry scorn for Royal Academy exhibitions had left them utterly unimpressed . <P> Last week 's opening had little to do with art , a lot to do with England . Star picture was Frank Ernest Beresford 's The Princes ' Vigil showing the four sons of the late King George V standing guard around his catafalque in the ancient barn of West minster Hall . The artist was chiefly proud of having sketched it so discreetly on his shirt cuffs that no mourner was offended . The high-collared oldster Frank Owens Salisbury drew the greatest crowds with his official portrait of King George at the Silver Jubilee services in St. Paul 's last year . He loyally entitled this commonplace job The Heart of the Empire . Others portrayed King George riding , the Duke of York , the Duchess of York , their two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Edward VIII . <P> King Edward has an absolute veto over pictures chosen for the Royal Academy exhibition , because it is technically his Academy . This year he used his prerogative to extend the deadline for submitting pictures , to oblige Simon Elwes who had painted the official portrait of the Duke of York . <P> The whole show was a portrait of England . It was full of pictures of substantial English gentlemen like the late Earl Jellicoe , Field Marshal Lord Milne , the Archbishop of Canterbury , the Lord Bishop of London , the Right Honorable Leslie Hore-Belisha . It included Battersea Twilight , two pictures of Plymouth Sound , a great number of hunting scenes , the usual Spring in Cornwall , this time by the Academy 's first and only full-fledged female member , Laura Knight , Dame Commander of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire . It had an extraordinary supply of studies of English bars , the Academician 's favorite resource when he wants to get down to life in the raw . Even the nudes were all thoroughly English @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Notable were George Frederick Belcher 's humorous paintings . Of his I/ Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls he said last week , " It is a picture of a shabby though very happy gentleman who is obviously a street musician . He is at home , seated at his table . You can see he has been enjoying himself - there are heads and tails of her rings on a plate , a bottle which has contained stout , and a glass which betrays the fact that he has drunk the stout . There is also a half-empty packet of cigarets . The happy gentleman is all alone and he is leaning back in his chair playing his cornet . What is he playing ? Well , I 've called the picture I Dreamt I Dwelt in Marble Halls . " The name of the piece is the only thing not made explicitly clear in the picture . <P> Exception to the rule of painstaking British portraitists is venerable , bearded , cantankerous Augustus Edwin John , 57 . He had always ignored the Academy until it elected him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a Paris Bohemian of 1890 and named one of his daughters Poppet , last week exhibited two bold , admirable portraits .
