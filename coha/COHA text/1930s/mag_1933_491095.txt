YEZ I BEGAN the covering of my short docks late in December , 1930 , and completed it early in the new year . IBy then the market . was showing improvement.and some of my favorites had already rallied measurably from their lowest prices . But my profits were very large , and again I could find no more satisfactory resting place For them than in the securities of my own Government . It was my plan to go to Europe nod loaf for a time somewhere along 1 he Mediterranean . I have already said that I think it is wise for a man to go away when be has liquidated a market position , whether with a profit or a loss , and so get opportunity to reason more calmly than he could in the immediate neighborhood of Wall Street . That is a lesson I learned years ago from that exceptionally shrewd man , Bernard Baruch . But in January , ' : n , illness in my family compelled me to change my arrangements and stay in New York . By reason of that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new hopefulness in financial and industrial circles and of a January-February market rise that reflected it . The feeling gained ground that the worst had been seen in domestic trade and the corner turned . It was generally admitted , I think , that improvement would necessarily be slow , but there was increasing conviction that . the trend would he upward . Personally , I could n't see much reason for the new cheerfulness , hut , nevertheless , it spread and had considerable effect upon stocks for a time . It soon became apparent that numerous interests and individuals were alert to seize opportunities to exploit the change in market sentiment and conditions . Bullish operations by cliques of traders and by interested sponsors of this stock and that were quickly in evidence , and some had highly entertaining results . The most spectacular performance was given by that always volatile motor-company issue , Auburn Auto . I just missed being caught in it . Alone in a Bull Ring A UBURN was one of the stocks which had sold above 500 in ' 29 , and although it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ climbed above 250 again in ' 30 before sliding to about 60 . The wide fluctuations and sensitiveness of this stock in the market were due primarily to the company 's small capitalization and to the relatively large holdings of those who controlled it . Because of those holdings , the floating supply of Auburn shares in Wall Street was unusually limited . After the market began to pick up in December , Auburn began to climb . it had already advanced from around 60 to above 100 , and its further rise attracted bearish opposition . Before long , it became evident that a very merry fight was in progress in the stock , and I was sufficiently interested to make inquiries . I found that the leading bear on Auburn , and the heaviest short seller of it , was a Western multimillionaire . When I learned that. , I put aside a budding desire to sell some of the stock short myself . There was n't enough Auburn to be bad to permit many short sellers . The short seller continued to sell Auburn Auto as it rose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of his activity he was short of pretty nearly 50.000 shares , That is unlikely , for it was more stock than he knew to be outside the ownership of the controlling interests . Yet . his short selling , perhaps in addition to that of others , was so large as to create a corner in Auburn . Wisely , however , the men in control did not make the corner operative . They supplied sufficient stook to meet the requirements of the millionaire and whoever else might want to maintain a short position . So there was no reason For action by the Stock Exchange or ground for any appeal to the courts , and Auburn 's price continued to rise . In time , therefore , and of ' necessity , the Western man asked for terms . I understand that the settlement price was 8250 a share , which meant the loss of many millions . The stock went well above that price in the market , reaching 290 in April . That Auburn Auto episode , in spite of its obvious character , was quite a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and a number of men who had been hurt and discredited by the great declines of ' 29 and ' 30 began to make signs of comebaCk . That was so , for instance , of an old friend , with whom optimism is a congenital obsession . He emerged from the blankets that had fallen upon him and attempted a market operation in Industrial Rayon . That stock rose rapidly in February from around 50 to 85 , and for a little time we of Wall Street received bullish advice on it from associates of more than one leading commission firm . But , as so many other stocks also demonstrated , the pub-lic and the semiprofessionals were shy . Within a few months Rayon was down below 30 again . About that time , as I recall , I had the good fortune to be able to decline an invitation to a little party at Pinehurst , in North Carolina . A group of kindred spirits  --  conspicuous stock-market performers  --  went there for a holiday , and I might have gone with them if illness at home had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early spring of ' 31 . Playing Both Ends I T VAS not many days before the then rather dull and uncertain stock market was suddenly stimulated by aggressive , concentrated buying of a few leading issues . Investigation showed the orders to have come from Pinehurst , and Wall Street curiosity was greatly piqued . The effect of the buying . however , was not great . Prices ceased to advance after its completion . and the market fell bark again . Then , a day or two later , urgent selling suddenly appeared in the same stocks that had been bought , and this also came from Pinehurst . It knocked quotations down quite effectually , but when it stopped , the decline stopped , and was followed by a rally . Wall Street waited , puzzled , and , after another day or two , Pinehurst became once more a buyer . And that was all . The story came out later . The party at Pinehurst , recovering one night from a hard day at golf , had been inspired to constitute itself a bull pool  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the turn did not materialize , and on another night of recovery it was decided that what was most timely was a bear pool . Whereupon the bought stocks were sold out with losses and Pinehurst went . short . The market , however , was still unsympathetic . The bear venture promptly became as expensive as that on the bull side had been . So the party covered its shorts , deeided to have no pool at all , and came home nursing its wounds and none too happy . One of its members wrote the amount of his losses on a slip of paper and showed it to me . " What price parties ? " he asked me dejectedly . Michael Meehan is a remarkable person  --  a redheaded Irish dynamo for whom I have immense admiration and affection . Having been in Wall Street for thirty years , I necessarily knew him when , as an assistant to the McBrides , theater-ticket agents , he was making the friends who later were his willing supporters as curb broker , as Stock Exchange specialist and commission-house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the great crash . It was my fortunate opportunity to be one of those . The worst . that I can say of Mike Meehan is that he is an incorrigible bull and makes a very poor bear . It was , more than any other factor , his intense enthusiasm and energy that brought about the marvelous rise in Radio Corporation shares to which the expansion of that company itself was so closely related . As a broker and a specialist , he was the pioneer bull on Radio , and in one way and another it was he who influenced the absorption of huge blocks of the stock by potent financiers until the loose supply of it ber.anie so small that later excited speculative buying could lift it . above . $5011 a share . I know that. , for I was one of those who were in Radio and profited largely , although I sold out long before it reached its top . Meehan , beyond most others who came to the front . in the fantastic boom of the lute 20 's , earned his prominence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boom times , but it was not merely an accident of those times that carried him into association with the most forceful tycoons of the period and made him the outstanding figure on the Stock Exchange . Attendants in the galleries there will tell you that even in these days of public apathy toward the stock market and all its works , visitors ask first to have Mike Meehan pointed out to them on the trading floor . The disappearance or present inactivity of the men who became stock-market potentates and heroes prior to the panic of ' 29 is not only impressive of itself but it is proof of my theory that boom-top profits are inevitably fleeting , and worse than fleeting . Once the newspapers were making constant reference to a dominant Big Ten of new giants . But none of those titans were , or could be , so flexible mentally or financially as to keep their statures after the bubble broke . I am referring now to the more spacious , more vivid bull-market figures who have gone into eclipse . To be sure , there are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ capture bear-market profits sufficient to offset in part the shrinkage in value of the securities in which much of their fortunes are necessarily invested . These are not of the class I have in mind , however , and , at that , they are exceptional . Baruch is one who never seeks and rarely gets much attention , and yet for years he has been , perhaps , the most consistent moneymaker in Wall Street . That , I may say , is logical . Of all the financiers and speculators I have known , Bernie Baruch possesses the keenest mind and the greatest intelligence . With that is combined a jubilant and adventurous spirit . Some Sidelights I DO not know how , but I know that I Baruch has profited largely in the past two years . As to his ventures in stocks , I have no details except those mentioned in vague and undependable rumors , but I know that he was one of the first to foresee the financial collapse of Europe . But at the same time , I believe , he retained large holdings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corporations . The list . notably includes Alaska Juneau , a gold-mining company in the stock of which the otherwise bearish Ben Smith has ' leen a bullish operator from time to time during the past two years . Alaska Juneau became unique when it made an all-time high record on the Stock Exchange in ' 31 . It is probably unnecessary for me to explain that Percy Rockefeller is a nephew of the aged John D. , but not always en ra ppuri with that branch of the family . It is my belief that . his selling operations in ' 30 and ' 31 were much exaggerated by popular report . I think they were , in large part , sales against his box  --  that is to say , short sales made to match and hedge his holdings of shares of Standard011 and othercompanieswith which the Rockefeller name is associated . This , however , is not to dispute that Percy Rockefeller did engage  --  and perhaps largely  --  in bearish performances in alliance with Ben Smith and other active players of the short side . Undoubtedly , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the committee at Washington , and in all probability his profits were relatively great . But . my information leads me to believe that with him , as with other men in similar circumstances , the profits made as a hear were only partial offsets to the depreciation of owned securities that occurred simultaneously . I have been gossiping too much . I must get back to the stock market of early ' 31 . The rise of January was continued through February , being sustained by faint signs of trade betterment here and there . To me , sitting on the sidelines once more , with no market commitments whatever , the signs were not at all convincing , and neither was the market 's strength . Nevertheless , the change for the better in sentiment that was evident in many quarters was something to be reckoned with , and I was quite content to continue watchful waiting . The watchfulness included closer attention to the growing financial strain abroad and the continuing fall in silver that was paralyzing the buying power of an immense Oriental population . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it showed a decline of approximately 50 per cent from its value eighteen months before , and the economic significance of that appeared more and more ominous to me as I studied the subject . Its relation to world consumption , to commodity prices and to international trade and finance was obvious . I became convinced that its importance was being underestimated in Wall Street , particularly by the bankers , who should have been most concerned . Those bankers , however , preferred to discuss the current pick-up in steel and automobile production and cotton consumption , the country 's unprecedented holding of gold , the disappearance of pressing liquidation in the stock and bond markets , the recovery of prices on the Stock Exchange and the better feeling that went hand in hand with it . I talked to many of them at that time , but found no real anxiety over conditions abroad . In March , the market turned downward again without apparent new reason . The moderate and slow trade improvement was continuing ; there was a slight gain in employment ; even silver bullion 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and continuing liquidation became evident again . Then the dividend reductions began  --  New York Central , Baltimore &; Ohio , Anaconda Copper , Delaware , Lackawanna &; Western . Before the end of the month it was clear that another market slump was under way , and stress in various Wall Street quarters became evident . Missing a Decline T WANTED to sell stocks again , but I did I not want to sell them and go away . And going away was just then imperative . For the convalescence of the member of my family who had been so ill , a stay at a European spa was ordered , and necessarily that . meant Europe for me also . So I overcame my itch to be short of the market once more and went abroad . Before I sailed , however , unpleasant things happened . The market declined materially , the stress increased , and finally a big and active Stock Exchange firmPynchon &; Co. ? was compelled to suspend . That failure was brought about by credit conditions and by severe declines in the quoted values @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which the firm , its banking associates and its clients were deeply concerned . Strenuous efforts were made to save the Pynclion house . The banking institution with which it was most closely connected was strongly urged to extend more aid than prudence would have permitted , but the suspension was not avoided . A few days after the Pynehon disaster I sailed for Europe . Stocks were still dropping when I arrived there , and were considerably lower still before I had things settled and could get to Paris . The decline continued without much interruption until early June , carrying prices to the lowest level recorded since ' 25 . It was an extensive decline  --  more than seventy points in the industrial-stock average from the February top  --  and I missed it completely . Early in May I was in Paris . 1 recall that the first American news I received there was of a reduction in the New York rediscount rate to 1 per cent  --  the lowest official rate ever established in any country . A week later I dined quietly with a distinguished American , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has long lived abroad . The news of that day was quite different . The great Kreditanst alt had virtually failed . The man with whom I dined was , and is , an intimate of European bankers and statesmen , and singularly well informed in respect of European high finance and its intricacies . He was greatly depressed that night by the Austrian collapse . He knew that the bank held upward of 5100,000,000 in foreign short-term credits , and he found no reassurance in the Austrian Government 's queer emergency measures which saved the bank from immediate official acknowledgment of insolvency . " This is the beginning of real trouble , " he warned me . " It is certain to create serious strain elsewhere , and particularly where there is least ability to stand it . We must keep our eyes open , all of us . We shall have to watch Germany . I am afraid of that situation now , and if there is a breakdown there , God knows how far it will reach and what damage it will do . " We sat long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me , personally , it was a fortunate evening , for it gave me at least some vague foresight of what came later . I walked back to my hotel convinced that new financial catastrbphe in Europe was more than a possibility , and wondering how it might ultimately affect America . Before I went to sleep I decided to get back to New York as soon as I could . A fortnight afterward I was on a boat , westward bound . When I arrived home early in June , a crisis in Germany was already apparent . Wall Street Myopia Then , for a month , the New York stock market advanced . Why , I can not tell . It advanced in the face of what seemed to me to be an unprecedented aggregate of unfavorable and threatening facts . Apart from President Hoover 's successful arrangement of a one-year moratorium on German reparations and international war debts , and a. move by American railroads to secure a 15 per cent raise in freight rates , I can recall no bullish feature of the picture in June , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The devastating run of Germany 's creditors upon her gold reserves became panicky . Far more important to our own country were widespread runs of depositors upon domestic banks that were causing suspensions in all sections and were accompanied by paralyzing hoarding of currency far and wide . Commodity prices , merchandise exports , steel and motor-car production , construction activities , railroad loadings , industrial employment  --  all these declined . Dividend reductions continued , a particularly significant one being that by the Pennsylvania Railroad . The Morgan-distributed German Government bonds that were floated at 90 in the preceding year dropped to 65 . At that time , too , the breakdown of Cyrus Eaton 's overbuilt , financial tower was pointing out increasing danger in other pyramided greatnesses . With the fall the big banking-brokerage house of Otis &; Co. folded up , thirty years and more after it began business modestly in Cleveland as Otis &; Hough . It was , I thought , a dangerously myopic stock market that moved forward even moderately , even temporarily . Justifications were freely suggested , to be sure  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , gains in the country 's gold holdings , placement in American securities of credits withdrawn from Europe , and various other fanciful theories . But fundamental conditions both at home and abroad were growing worse steadily , and the strength of stocks seemed to me to be wholly fantastic . I was eager to go short of them , and I delayed only because of a rule I never break . Well , hardly ever . I rarely sell short in a rising market , just as I rarely buy speculatively in a falling one . wait until I can follow the trend  --  until the trend becomes what I think it should be . Adherence to the rule is not always easy . However , I did not have to wait very long in this case . Change came in July ; and when I was convinced that it really was change , I sold stocks . That was just as the extensive aid given internationally to Germany was proving insufficient . It was just as the run of withdrawals of foreign credits spread suddenly to Great Britain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I plunged on the short side of the market . I found myself by no means lonely as an active hear . On the contrary , I had plenty of company . There was a fairly large short interest in the market already . Most of the bearishness that was articulate , however , was being professed or practiced by Wall Street professionals and semiprofessionals . As a rule , the men of substance , financial and industrial , were not admitting pessimism even if they felt it , and most of those with whom I talked had lists of favorite stocks which they thought already too absurdly low to go any lower 31 . The extent and effects of their selling were greatly exaggerated by the newspapers and by the public 's imagination . No doubt . such selling was a factor after the market became weak , but it was only a supplemental factor . Neither Wall Street bearishness nor the short selling that expressed it was responsible for the economic and financial conditions which logically produced further liquidation and again lowered security values . Certainly , my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fall in stock prices , did not include any expectation of destructive bear operations in the market . I gave no count to such adventitious aid , and I am quite sure that my reckoning would have been just as true if there had been none of it . When Britain Went Off Gold I made my plunge in July . For a while the market disappointed me . It was heavy , with prices slowly working lower , but it did not reflect what I saw as increasing menace in Europe . Vast international protective measures were proving insufficient one by one , and the strain at London was obviously dangerous . Wall Street 's comparative Placidity puzzled me . I felt sure it could not last . Of course , it did not last . By September the market was in full retreat once more before the pressure of selling that became heavy and urgent . Then came the startling , shocking climax of what had become panic in European finance . Great Britain suspended gold payments . Strong efforts were made to have the New York Stock Exchange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ became known to America . Fortunately , Richard Whitney and his council of governors kept their heads and refused to take that unnecessary and unwarranted step . It was good judgment , too , to clap handcuffs on those who would have hammered the market with short sales . Inconsistent with Stock Exchange theories and practice as it was , the ban put upon short selling while sudden and unreasoning fear prevailed was most timely , to say the least .. It . was protective , and it was official admission by Wall Street that short selling can he dangerously destructive and should not be uncontrolled . That admission was timely also . There can be no reasonable doubt that the short selling which intentionally reduces market values should be prohibited . To some , I suppose , that statement will seem hypocritical . Coming from one who profited largely from short sales throughout the bear market , the opinion that short selling is an evil may sound like Pecksniff . That , however , will occur only to those who are so lacking in common sense that they can not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practice and that which is deliberately destructive for selfish gain . It is the latter that I believe should be , and ultimately will be , abolished by law . Clipping the Bears ' Claws I have no desire to sermonize or to debate in defense of a theory . Indeed , it is not a theory , but a recognized practical fact , that short selling  --  that is , freedom to anticipate a decline in prices and speculate accordingly  --  is essential to the preservation of balance in any stock market in which there is speculation . And , being essential as well as desirable , it can not he prevented . Attempts to prohibit it will result in the undesirable equivalent of bootlegging . If there is money to be made from a decline in stocks , a way to make it will be found , cumbersome though it may be . But the usage of short sales to drive market prices down and to diminish the collateral values of securities is not essential to anything . It is the equivalent of sabotage in industry , and quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any permanent harm , for when it does not merely hasten what is inevitable , its effects are rarely more than temporary . Nevertheless , short-selling operations that take the form of deliberate raiding or ' of manipulation of prices downward constitute a destructive evil from which owners of securities and lenders thereon should be protected . The comparatively new Stock Exchange rule which forbids short transactions to be made precedent to , or at a lower price than , sales of long stocks is a very good thing . I would like to see it more rigidly enforced and more conscientiously observed . The Government 's imposition of a supertax upon the short seller is , I believe , much less efficacious , particularly with respect to the kind of short selling that is most destructive . The scheme of having the names , dealings and positions of short sellers reported daily or weekly to the Business Conduct Committee of the Exchange is , of course , an effort to exploit cowardice . One of its natural results is concealment by a variety of expedients . In connection with all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say that I do not believe that any of my profits made on the short // side of the market . from ' 29 to ' 32 were the consequences of performances by bear operators or traders . I went short of stocks because of economic and financial conditions , present and prospective , as I saw them . As they developed , those conditions impaired credit , earning power , intrinsic value and what not , and from that proceeded voluntary and involuntary liquidation under the pressure of which market prices receded . I would have done quite as well , I am sure , if there had not been another bear or short seller in Wall Street . Probably I would have done better . There were times when the shorts were decidedly helpful to the market . When , with further short selling temporarily banned , the bears covered their positions following England 's abandonment of the gold standard , they brought about a spirited and reassuring three-day spurt in prices . I recall that it cut into my paper profits materially . Naturally , it did not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  Sweden , Norway , Denmark  --  also suspended gold payments , and when it became evident that enormous drafts were to be made by Europe upon America 's stock of gold . The certainty of huge withdrawals of foreign credits and of consequently higher discount rates made the already ominous domestic banking situation appear all the more threatening . For days in late September and early October both stock and bond markets , steadily pressing farther into new low ground , seemed upon the verge of collapse . But then , suddenly , President Hoover decided to act , and to effect a grouping of powerful banks to give aid to tottering ones pending protective action by Congress in December . Mere intimation of that was sufficient to turn stocks abruptly and sharply upward , and official announcement following the White House conference at which agreement was reached led to a veritable rush of buying at rapidly advancing quotations . I was part of that rush . I covered something less than half of my outstanding line of shorts . A little later I covered more . Out of Step @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't . The market moved upward for a month or more , and its advance was considerable . Various conditions , including the prices of domestic farm products and of foreign and domestic bonds , showed sufficient improvement to bring about generally better sentiment . Hopefulness appeared in some quarters where it had been absent for many months . I could not share it ; yet it tempered my abiding bearishness and made me cautious with respect to my short commitments . It made me too cautious . Although I felt sure that the market 's decline was being only temporarily interrupted , I failed to restore my bear position to its former size on the advance that carried into November . In fact , I did not sell again until the following month , and by that time the market had slipped lower than it was when I did my covering . So I missed the turn I might have made , and was worse off than if I had done no covering at all . I should not have tried to make the turn . I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be one . And that was not all . Thrown off my stride , I blundered again and again during three months of confusing ups and downs . After reaching a new low level in mid-December , the market rallied . It dropped back to the same level in January and then rallied again . Once more , in February , it reached that level and recovered from it . This was what traders and chart addicts call a triple bottom . Theoretically , it is a distinctly bullish promise . I have very little faith in traders ' theories and none at all in charts . I confess , however , that the action of stocks in the first quarter of ' 32 weakened my bearish courage considerably . At that time , moreover , it was necessary to recognize that a most menacing feature of the domestic situation had been minimized or removed by the establishment of the Reconstruction Finance Corporation . Other helpful Government measures , already in force or projected , were also to be considered . Indeed , with security values already so greatly marked down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ standing should review his judgment . Wreckage Floats . Rshore But new wreckage and new weaknesses were coming to light constantly . The uncertain Transamerica situation was developing into the fierce struggle between A. P. Giannini and Elisha , Walker which resulted in the elimination of the latter and his BancamericaBlair faction from the management , with the value of their holdings very seriously diminished . The huge Insull pyramid began to sway and crumble at Chicago . Electric Bond &; Share tycoons found reason to contract their expanded capitalization by reducing three shares to one . The far-flung Kreuger &; Toll empire tottered obviously in February and collapsed when Ivor Kreuger shot himself to death in Paris in March . Beyond doubt , the sensational disclosures and the unsettlements following in the train of Kreuger 's death did much to beget new nervousness and precipitate renewed declines in stocks . At the end of March , the market went into new low ground , breaking through the , **26;519;TOOLONG , triple bottom . After that , another cloud of hopelessness  --  a dense one  --  descended upon Wall Street . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ without news to provide specific excuse for their slumping . As one financial writer put it , " emotional demonstrations have been replaced by a kind of stolid resignation . " Elsewhere it was said , " The common inquiry in Wall Street now is ' Do you see any light ? ' The common answer is ' Not yet . ' " Those two quotations were accurately descriptive . As the gloom increased and stocks went lower and lower in April and early May , my profits grew constantly and waxed very large . Yet it became more and more evident to me that the continuing liquidation was increasingly corrective , and that the bear selling accompanying it was increasingly unintelligent . Day by day I saw or heard of the final clearing away of wreckage , the demolition of positions that had been irreparably impaired and were menacing while they remained so . The liquidation that was accomplishing this was ultimate . I It could not occur again with the same cause . I t was water that would not turn the mill any more . At the same @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ increasing the size of the short interest was feeding and fattening upon conditions that already had been effective marketwise . The bear arguments , as they are called , were stressing old and well-recognized facts , emphasizing what already was , and not what was to be . I came to realize that I was hearing too much of that sort of thing . The market was moving in my favor and giving no intimation of turn , or even of halt . Nevertheless , I began to think it had reached those lowest reaches of its great decline where the wise cease to follow it . And , anyhow , stocks were getting very , very low . In that gloomy time , less than a year ago , each day seemed to bring some new evidence of the terrible , incredible slaughter of men 's fortunes . The stories that were told fluently and found easy confirmation were amazing even to one who was well aware of the extent to which depreciation of stock and bond values had gone . Although one knew how this man and that had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afterward , it was amazing to hear in ' 32 of the depths of the financial mire into which those men had been plunged . I am not referring to those who ran shoestrings into millions and then lost both the millions and the shoestrings . It was not surprising to hear of the disappearance of the accidental profits of market players of that sort . The drama in such stories was sordid and unmoving . But the men of greater parts , of established station , of active occupation in the business enterprises of their generation  --  the crashing disasters that engulfed such as those were all but beyond comprehension . I could fill columns of THE SATURDAY EVENING POST with true tales of old and new fortunes swept away , of whole families reduced from affluence to real poverty , of the buildings of three and four generations demolished beyond recovery . Nor should it be thought that such disasters were the results of the continuation of the depression through ' 31 and ' 32 . Many occurred earlier . Buying From a Photograph In January , ' 29 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationally known business man of a city somewhat distant from New York . In addition to being a beneficiary of a trusteed family estate of considerable size , he had a large personal fortune . On the day of my visit , his desk was covered with glossy photographs of an industrial plant which , he told me , was a new venture of a company whose stock had been making a stir on the Exchange under the handling of one of the most energetic and spectacular operators of that day . I knew the operator very well . I also knew the stock . I had been urged to get into it and , after investigation , I had declined . My host proudly informed me that he was a friend and admirer of the operator , was following his lead and advice in the market , and was long of 50,000 shares of the stock represented by the photographs . He also was long of several other stocks , all of which enjoyed the same operator 's market guardianship . I said nothing until he asked my opinion , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ market because I thought it overbulled , too high and dangerous . I told him I would not be able to sleep at night if I were long of that 50,000 shares , as he was . He shrugged his shoulders and changed the subject . Not more than two weeks after that the man died very suddenly , leaving his entire personal fortune to his wife , fis there were no children . The stock of which he had 50,000 shares was selling around 80 . Three months later the wife died , By that time the stock had advanced to above 100 . Thus the value of the estate was increased $1,000,000 by the appreciation of that one asset between the deaths . The wife had not allowed any of the stock to be sold . The wife had no immediate family and willed most of what she had to a penniless relative by marriage . It was a marvelous windfall for him  --  perhaps $4,000,000 . But before the administration of her estate , complicated by that of her husband 's , got well under way , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stock of which 50,000 shares were held slumped badly . The lucky heir protested to the executors against the sale of any of that stock at the reduced market price , and his protest availed . The executors agreed to wait for a recovery . But the operator 's stock did not recover  --  at least , neither much nor for long . Before the end of ' 29 it sold down below $5 a share . The fortune of the man who had died while carrying 50,000 shares of it was quite wiped out. , and in less than a year . The heir is now worse off than before he became an heir . I have told the story to show that tragedies were occurring long before so many came to light in ' 31 and ' 32 that they lost novelty . Yet I suppose it is the few , and not the many , that have come to be known to those who , like myself , are concerned only with the affairs of Wall Street . and with the major stock market . I have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ widespread severe losses that resulted from frenzied financing of all sorts . The number of such promotions was so great that it was only a minor percentage of them whose stocks were active , or even listed , on the two New York exchanges . In a few of them I had short positions from time to time during the decline . But I had no acquaintance with countless other disaster-breeding bubbles of which those of the Insull group may be regarded a type . Neither had I any experience with shares of investment and trading companies . Bumper Stock Crops Although it was not very long ago , it is already a matter of astonishment that in the days of the creation of those giant trading concerns the public demand for their shares was so avid . In some eases the pre-offering hunger for the stock was so great that the promoters doubled the capitalization originally proposed before they offered any to the public . And even then it was hugely oversubscribed . Other bankers found their offerings so insufficient to meet the public 's clamor for more that theyhastened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and so on , with which to reap the harvests that were so amazingly greater than they anticipated . But I had no part in those performances , and the " investment " shares did not figure in any of my later bearish ventures . As with the unseasoned securities that fell so greatly and brought . sorrow to so many , I had little familiarity with them . T h ere-f o re , I have little to say about them in this story of mine . I was , after all , a speculator in relatively few stocks through the bear-market period . I do not think my ledger records more than a score of individual issues in which I had commitments . And , as a rule , no more than five or six at the same time . One of the things not to do in stock speculation is get spread out . There is not much more to the story , anyhow . I have already said that in April , ' 32 , with stocks fading daily and Wall Street gloom becoming deeper and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not far off . I began also to tell myself that a successful bear should not become a stubborn hog . Finally it became a question in my mind whether I should continue to ride the market down and cover my shorts only after I saw it had turned upward , or should cover immediately and forgo whatever profit might accrue to a maintained short position . Out of the Bear Pit I debated that with myself night . after night , marshaling and appraising the facts of the situation as I saw them , and trying to find the logical answer . In the end I threw everything away and followed my instinct . Before May was half over I had covered my last short . share and was quite out of the market . My bear 's chronicle ends there . Of course , the market went lower still . I expected it to do that . Its July bottom  --  the , lowest of ' 32 ? was well below that of the period of my covering . But I was not discontented by the spectacle . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has happened on the Stock Exchange since I abandoned my hear position . The truth is , I am now long of stocks . That is to say , I am the owner of a collection of carefully selected shares which I have bought and paid for fully , and packed away in my vault . I suppose such admission has no proper place in the story of a hear . Yet it would seem quite proper for a bear to tell why he is no longer bearish , and I think I can do that in very few words . It is because I expect the sun to go on shining , and the grass to go on growing , and the cows to go on giving milk , and the babies to go on being born . No one , not even such a superficial observer and thinker as a stock-market speculator is supposed to be , can be blind to the serious economic dislocations in which the whole postwar world is now involved . No one can ignore , with reason , the present unrest and dissatisfaction that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and economic . The potential bearing of all this upon what is now vested is obvious . Recognition of it is implied , I think , in the current level of market values  --  not only those of corporation securities but of real estate and all other forms of property . But if the recognition is discernible , it is because some measure of anticipation and preparation has accompanied it . ? In my opinion , that measure is much larger than will prove to have been justified . It corresponds to the 1929 measure of preparation for greater heights , which certainly proved to havebeen unjustified . Thethinkingin the : two periods ? ' 29 and ' 32 ? had the same quality . I did not agree with that of ' 29 , and I do not agree with that of the present . I did not believe then that there was a new economic era , and I do not believe now that the system of capitalism and property rights is going to disappear from America . I am in no sense flippant with respect to the current @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . There is much excuse for the alarm ; and if it is exaggerated , that is only human . But I do not share it . I would not think of engaging in dispute with the learned economists who rise to preach and do not stoop to practice , but I do not recognize the depression as differing in character or in cyclical sequence from others that . this country and all countries have known in the past . I have heard my father tell of the five or six years of deep depression in the 1870 's when unemployment and hunger and abject misery , unrelieved by available and efficient charity , went far beyond anything known of late . Yet that was not the end of either a system or a nation . In my own time  --  in the 1890 's ? American farmers burned their ten-cent corn for fuel and deputed William Jennings Bryan to guillotine the established order that was represented by the gold standard . But that was not the end of anything either . So I do not believe that our drop into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , than the working of the old , old law of impermanence  --  ebb and flow , rise and fall , action and reaction . I may be wrong  --  that will be no novelty  --  but . I expect to hold to my belief until I see more reason to abandon it than is anywhere visible to me now . For a further while , therefore  --  and perhaps for quite a while  --  bearishness and I will probably be strangers . Unchanging Humans But it will not be for always . You may depend upon that . Men do not . change , nor women . I do not know when , but in time there will be hilarity in Wall Street . again . The tickers will once more be running an hour late to record fancy prices made by infatuated speculators , by and with the advice and consent of the bankers and brokers and economists and plungers of the day . There will be discovery of a new , new era , simple arithmetic will be forgotten , and the bootstrap will regain its popularity in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And when that time comes  --  when you hear someone using a nation-wide radio hook-up to scold the Federal Reserve power for not letting speculators borrow all the cheap money they want  --  when you read that another is again saying that brokers ' borrowings would not be too huge if they totaled $12,000 , - 000,000 ? when that time comes , I say , and you try to locate the writer of this yarn , you will surely hind him barging along once more in the ranks of the bears .
