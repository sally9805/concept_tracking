Hour-limiting work laws for New Jersey females , including the 1923 law , which had no enforcing penalties , have exempted employes in the New Jersey canning industry . In the recent legislative session a new law was passed exempting the canneries but otherwise prohibiting the working of women between midnight and 7 a. m. , with $25 to $50 fines for first offenses , $200 for second , jail for recalcitrants . Harkening to pleas of the South Jersey glassmakers and Atlantic City hotel and restaurant owners , Republican Senator Charles E. Loizeaux rushed through a last-minute measure to extend the exemptions . Last fortnight somebody discovered that the law read , " canneries . . . , glass manufacturing establishments and hotel restaurants . " It should have read " hotels and ( or ) restaurants . " " I do n't know just how it happened , " said Senator Loizeaux . " It was the last day and the last bill and I did n't . . . check up on the wording . " Hundreds of waitresses , entertainers , hat-check girls and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about their jobs except that the Legislature is expected to remedy the omission at a special session already called for other purposes on June 28.
