txt Park Commissioner Robert Moses illustrated his way of getting things done yesterday by awarding two construction contracts on the Henry Hudson Bridge over the Harlem Ship Canal barely four hours after the Board of Estimate had approved the approaches to the span . Mr. Moses , as head of the Henry Hudson Bridge Authority , had scheduled the opening of bids for 3 o'clock yesterday afternoon at the Arsenal in Central Park . He did so on the assumption that the approaches would be approved by the Board of Estimate at yesterday 's meeting . Had the board failed to endorse his plans the result would have been embarrassing , but all went off according to schedule . The bridge spanning the Harlem Ship Canal will be an integral part of the Henry Hudson Parkway through Spuyten Duyvil . Property owners in that section appeared before the Board of Estimate to object to the route of the parkway . Alan Fox , who said he represented owners of $10,000,000 of real estate , declared that Spuyten Duyvil would be destroyed as a residential area if the automobile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ offered to donate ten acres of land worth $200,000 to carry the parkway outside the community instead of through it . Mr. Moses said Mr. Fox 's plan would mean an additional million dollars of cost . Representatives of Seton Hospital and the Baptist Home for the Aged protested that the parkway would cut off access to their buildings . Mr. Moses met this objection by offering to build an underpass serving both institutions . Spokesmen for the Hudson Garden Apartments protested that the parkway would take away fifty feet of apartment house lawn . The answer to that , Mr. Moses said , was that two-thirds of the lawn involved was on city-owned land . When the property owners asked that the matter be referred back to Borough President James J. Lyons of the Bronx , Mr. Lyons declined any responsibility for the project . " Under the law setting up the Henry Hudson Bridge Authority , " he said , " Mr. Moses is the oneman czar of the Authority , with complete control over the spending of its funds . I do n't want this thing dumped in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm in favor I of the project , but I object to czars , whether they be Commissioner Moses or Mayor La Guardia . As1 President of the Bronx I assume no responsibility for the route laid out by this Authority . " Mr. Lyons said the Republicancontrolled Assembly had conferredl wide powers on Mr. Moses by making him the sole member of the Authority . He called the bill " tyrannical , " but said the people of his borough wanted the bridge . Mayor La Guardia twitted him on his remarks , saying that he would like to have a copy of the Lyons speech to read at the opening of the bridge . Low Bidders Get Contracts . After the board approved the parkway plans Mr. Moses went back to the Arsenal for the opening of the bids . The Thomas Crimmins Contracting Company of 734 Lexington Avenue got a contract for $272,668.50 for the substructure of the bridge . Its figure was the lowest of eleven bidders . It submitted an alternate bid of $324,090.50 , with stone facing included in the larger amount . The American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ steel superstructure of the bridge , bidding $865,208.59 . It was the lowest of five bidders . Work on both contracts will start immediately . The span will be 840 feet long and will have a clearance of 142.5 feet above mean high water . It will have a forty-two-foot motor roadway and sidewalks . The bridge is scheduled for completion on Oct. 1 , 1936 . The expected dispute over Mr. Moses 's plans for improving Riverside Park did not materialize at the meeting because the ' matter was postponed until next Wednesday . Mayor La Guardia said the postponement was voted because of the absence of Borough President Samuel Levy of Manhattan , who is supporting an alternate plan . He said the plans would be discussed at a public hearing on Wednesday , following the public hearing already scheduled on the proposed municipal power system . Before it adjourned , the board voted an appropriation of $4,500 for the report of the Aldermanic Committee Investigating Relief . Aldermanic President Bernard S. Deutsch voted for ' the appropriation with the explanation that he understood some of the committee 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He said he hoped some of the $4,500 would be turned back to the city . Mr. Deutsch introduced in the Municipal Assembly his bill providing for spot payments of small fines for minor offenses , according to a fixed schedule . The fines would be made by offenders who did not desire a judicial hearing of their cases . The bill sets up a board consisting of the chief city magistrate , the Police Commissioner and the Mayor to establish the method by which fines are to be paid . Offenders desiring a court hearing would be entitled to it as at present . The bill was referred to the committee on local laws .
