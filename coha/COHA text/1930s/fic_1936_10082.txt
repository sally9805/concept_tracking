lines of her mouth , the confident expression of her eyes , the tone of her hands  --  if I may use this expression to describewhat to me has always been the most accurate gauge of a woman 's experience  --  and above all the outlines of her body which , while young and resilient , was not that of a girl , confirmed my instinct that she was a woman of experience . Yet the austerity of her manner , the total absence of coquetry , the invisible certainty that she was mistress of herself , of me , of this and all future situations , gave me to understand that love had never yet insinuated a tender and delicious meaning into her mind and heart . Much could be ascribed to her earnest preoccupation with her exacting art , but I sensed also that whatever experience she had had of man and his ardor had been to her a dreadful thing , and had left her cold and rigid . I felt that I must not only woo her , but that I was facing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of romance . For a woman less overpoweringto my imagination , less new in every thought and action , less magnificent in personality , I should never have set myself this difficult task . It might have sufficed merely to meet her . But Lena Geyer took relentless possession of every thread and fibre of my being . If I had felt from hearing and seeingher as an artist upon the stage that she was predestined for my heart and my arms , I knew now with unwavering certainty that she must ultimately yield to my love . Already I was all too keenly aware that she might lack to an agonizing degree the capacity to love me reciprocally , but that would be after all part of her vast , if austere , nature . It was within the bounds of possibility that love could be for her only a rich accessory to the main core of her existence , her singing . There I must take my chances . I made no reference to the inaccessibility that had kept allp101Paris at bay , and she none to my persistence in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ characteristic of our association had its inception there ; we never reviewed in conversation any event or attitude that was past . What is called nowadays a " post-mortem " in discussion was totally absent from our relationship . All of our understanding was tacit to a remarkable degree , and our ability to dispense with discussion admitted no leeway for petty disagreements and lovers ' quarrels . During that first evening she was so subduedof manner that , after making all allowances for her fatigue , I was convinced rather against my instinctive judgmentthat she was deficient in animation , although such vitality emanated from her quiet form that I could accept my own analysis only with hesitation . I took her home an hour after midnight , and as I was leaving her at the lift in the lobby of her hotel , I asked if I might hope for the privilege of seeing her again . She smiled quietly and said she was looking forward to our next meeting . I inquired what day and what time of day would give her the most pleasure . After a moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The appointed day dawned beautifully soft , and clear , with a benign early June sun . I decided as soon as Pierre drew the curtains in my bedchamber to call for Madame Geyer in the trap , which I would myself drive with Rouart , the younger groom , behind . This order , when it reached the stables , was doubtless no disappointment to Poquelin , my father 's old coachman , who frowned upon all my gay excursionsand felt himself much belittled by some of the nocturnaldestinations to which I had , in the past , commanded him to drive me . He , of all my retainers , would have been the most highly pleased by my marriage , for he would then have had a young mistress to drive out for afternoon calls andp103thrown back in token of complete enjoyment . I was so distractedwith delight that I could barely direct the necessary amount of attention to my high-spirited horses , and the gods themselves must have laughed at the exuberance of our spirits as we flew through the alleys of the Bois . If I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ secret previously , I had no more such illusions now , for within the hour the news had flown through Paris  --  Chartres was drivingLena Geyer in the Bois , and both were joyful with a joy that could mean one thing alone . We lunched at Armenonville , and though the trees were in full leaf and the atmosphere lacked the ineffable beguile ment of our beloved Paris in early May , spring was fresh in my heart and I think Madame Geyer was happier than the mere pleasure of the occasion would indicate . I wanted to consult her about the menu , but she would not listen ; she waved it aside and told me to order whatever I wished . I can not remember what we ate , but I know she ate it with enormous relish . I being already in love and turbulent with adoration , could not eat a mouthful , and only remember drinking glass after glass of a particularly fine Chevalier Montrachet that I had chosen to accompany the trout . The quality of Madame 's mood prevented the conversation from turning @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of the ridiculous , and when one of our celebrated dowager countesses appeared upon the terrasse , puffing and waddling , followed by a small old pug puffing and waddling in identical rhythm , I thought Madame Geyer would choke from suppressed laughter . But as we were finishing our coffee  --  she had refused a five , and I learned that she never drank distilled spirits  --  she gazed out upon the park with its leafy boughs woven into a tapestry shot through by the pleasant sunshine . " I do lovep104Paris , " she said , " I can easily see why it captures so many willing victims . But I must tear myself away , helms ! " My heart sank and seemed to crash somewhere in ruins about my boots . " You are going away ? " I asked in consternation . " But of course , " she answered with a gesture . " Back to Berlin . Were you not aware that I belong there ? " Of course I had known this , but in the excitement of havingher in Paris had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed , for she laughed softly . " I shall be back , " she said . " Next spring , when the chataignicrs are blooming here . " She pointed to the branches over our heads . I followed her gesture , and somethingwithin me seemed to exclaim , to tell my willing mind to follow the motion of that strong white hand . The necessitywas clear ; I too must go . But I said nothing to her , not daring to let her guess the full power of my motives . I murmuredsome reasonably conventional sentiments of regret , and ascertained that she had but two performances more in Paris before leaving for her summer in Austria , followed by the winter season at the royal opera in Berlin . I saw Madame Geyer three times more before the day of her departure  --  once when she allowed me to join her for her long daily walk . In vain slid T attempt to entice her into my jeweller 's upon the Rue de la Paix , to select some little memento of our happy acquaintance . Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never seen one of our great French actresses and was deeply moved by a noble performance of Phaedre . The last evening I spent with her was the night of her final appearance . She had sung Elisabeth , the part in which Paris loved her best and gave her most lavishly its adoration in demonstration and applause . I had no definite engagement with her ; I had sensed herp105reluctance to make one , and had merely sent a note , with my flowers , hoping that she would not be too tired after the performanceto enjoy her supper and her rest . Her singing that night was inspired to a degree . Indeed when she delivered the greeting to the hall of song , with indescribably thrilling beauty and brilliance of voice , she seemed almost to be singing to the Opera itself , to the hall where she had had such triumphs in one short season , and so utterly captivated the hearts of the capricious Parisians . As I went backstage after the curtain , I found to my annoyance that the guard , in spite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or five determined worshippers to the corridor of her room , who stood around hoping somehow to be admitted to her presence . When they saw me they exchanged significant glances . The situation was indeed delicate , for I had no reason to suppose that I would be admitted , and if I were not , there would be a mortifying tale all over the boulevards next morning . If , however , I were admitted , there would also be a tale . But it was too late to retreat . I knocked upon the door , which was opened a crack by one Dora , Madame Geyer 's ill-tempered maid who , I am sure , would gladly have slammed the door in my face . But she dared not , having once previously been told to admit me , and after glancing at me a moment , she asked me to wait while she consulted her mistress . Almost immediately she returned and invited nie to enter . And as the heavy door closed behind me I could picture only too clearly the buzz of comment that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , still in costume and make-up , which rather surprised me as she had had considerabletime to remove them . She was an unpredictable woman ; , if she usually hastened to remove her costumes , there were times when she made no haste at all , and gave no reasonP106therefor . She held out both hands to me with a warm smile of greeting , and I clasped them , barely managing to restrain my impulse to cover them with passionate kisses . " Flow kind of you to come , " she said , a remark that . , naturally astonished me in view of her known dislike of dressing-room visitors . I soon learned that what she disliked was curious , importunate strangers flocking to her dressing room ; she enjoyed the visits of people of whom she was fond , finding the peculiar intimacy of the setting , permissible only to her profession , a sort of reward for good work upon the stage . So thorough was her absence of coquetry , of the instinct to associate her looks with studied effects , that she began @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had not been in the room . She asked me to seat myself and wait until she was ready , which was tantamount to an assurance that she would sup with me , and retiring behind a screen with the disagreeable Dora , emerged in a moment with her white robe replaced by a brief deshabille . She sat down and whisked the long blonde wig from her head , leaving an apparition for me to face in the mirror almost too grotesque for contemplation , at which she chuckled with amusement . " Anyone would think , " she said , " that you had never waited upon an actress in her dressing room ! " She gave me a look of deliberate raillery , and I felt constrained to assure her that this was a new experience for me . She drew down the corners of her mouth and pulled in her chin , narrowing her green eyes to a twinkle of mockery ; and I could only find words to protest by reminding her that this was hardly a becoming mood for the recently sainted Elisabeth . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she replied . " I never felt less like Elisabeth than I did this evening . This was the evening I should have sung Carmen ! Ai !  --  what I should have done as Carmen ! " She made a gesture of arm andP107elbow and shoulder , and a moue of tantalizing sorcery . She was in a mood to drive a man mad , one of a thousand , perhaps , of which I had seen only a few . Yet I knew that this was no real coquetry to lead me on , no flirting ; it was rather the high spirits of a young animal , the headiness of a colt that tries its own fleetness and power , and finds them good . This delightful mood continued through supper ; but as the meal drew to an end  --  a meal that remains unequalled in my memory for its sparkling humor and the fragrance of her personality  --  she became serious and leaned toward me across the table . " You have been so charming to me , " she said , " and you must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , at first , and brusque , will you believe it was not altogether intentional ? " It was as if she had said that she could not help herself . I longed to rise from my place , to go to her side and kneel beside her and plead my cause ; indeed , for a moment I thought the time was ripe , and gazed into her eyes for the signal I knew I should find there . Gaze as I would , however , I could find only friendship and deep appreciation . I knew the time had not come . I must wait . She was leaving Paris on the wagon-lit the following evening , and had consented to allow me to have Pierre make all her arrangements . I took her to the train , making sure that she was settled in her compartment with every comfort and luxury . Pierre had mineral water and white wine in an iced hamper , and fruit and books . I knew Madame Geyer expected of me a desolation because of her departure , desolation as great as that feeling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's leave of her . I remained deeply subdued , in fact speechless when the moment came to kiss her hand and bid her godspeed . My speechlessness , in reality , was half 08 profound emotion , and half an attempt to hide my delight at the thought of the trick I was playing upon her . Yet there was in that first good-bye between us another and deeper emotion for me , a profound satisfaction , a kind of burning joy which prang from my observation of her own genuine regret at parting from me . As I descended from the train and stood outside her window chatting with her , she kept a handkerchief in her hand ; and just as the train started to move she leaned from the window and said , " Perhaps if I knew you better , I would have serious use for this . " With which she waved it and disappeared . P109I HAD apprised myself thoroughly of Madame Geyer 's immediate plans . She was to join her celebrated teacher , Lilli Lehmann , in Berlin , and from there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to spend the summer in rest and study . I had arranged for someone in our Berlin Embassy to telegraph me the date of her first appearance in the fall , so soon as it was announced , and accordingly I learned that she was to reappear upon her home stage on October the twentieth . She had assured me with some want of alacrity in speaking of Berlin , that the Kaiser and the court would undoubtedly be present at her first appearance , as she had become one of the chief favorites of the company . Her marked indifference to the public favor of the Emperor struck me as a possible veiled reflection of private distaste , acquired in some manner about which I had no liberty to make inquiry . I could not , however , suppress my tacit curiosity , and found myself more than once pondering upon the devious threads that have for centuries entangled crowned heads with celebrated protagonists of the arts . Accordingly , I made my own plans , and went so far as to assign multifarious details of financial and administrative importance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ statement that I might be absent from France for an indefinite time . My dear mother 's piteous consternation wrung my heart , wherefore I forbore to inform her as to the actual motive for my departure , and was finally able to convince her that my absence was both necessary to myself , and not109 10 necessarily to be interpreted as cause for unhappiness upon her part . I took my departure from Paris , accompanied by a somewhat disillusioned Pierre , who had fatuously supposed that he would never again have to wander over the globe in my quixotic wake . Thus it was that upon the twentieth of October I had a place in the extremely brilliant audience that greeted Lena Geyer upon her return to that stage which , quite naturally , had assumed a proprietary interest in her . Her association with Lilli Lehmann , alone , would have caused the Berlin public to assume this attitude of prideful possession ; but when it became clear that Geyer , of all the great immortal 's pupils , gave the most promise of meeting the prodigious challengeof her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this  --  I must admit  --  most discriminating musical public . She sang the role I had last heard her perform , Elisabeth . But here an electrifying experience awaited me ; for I had heard her sing , in.Paris , only in French , a language in which she was as proficient as our native artists , and to which she lent some strength through the powerful validity of her impersonations . So insular does the strongly patriotic mind tend to become that I had really never considered the matter of opera in other languages than my own , in spite of the fact that the greatest works presented at our Opera were all translations from the German or the Italian in which they originated . Picture , then , my start of astonishment when the curtain of the second act rose upon the now gloriously familiarvision of my beloved hastening with arms upraised to greet the hall of song , and I heard that divine voice begin , Dick , teure Halle , griiss ' ich wieder ! Long before she finished , the inspiring aria had caused my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at once that I was hearing her as I had never really heard her before  --  in a vitalp111unity of language and music . Her prayer in the final act became a thousand times more poignant , the magnificent choral singing of the Pilgrims , in their own tongue , genuinelyreligious in inspiration . I had believed myself more than a little cynical , and an emotionally emancipated man , but I most freely admit that , dramatic spectacle as it was , that performance of Tannh &user; found no more humble and credulous listener than myself . The great Richard Strauss conducted . Immediately afterward I hastened backstage , not without some difficulty in convincing the burly Prussian guards stationedthroughout the building that I had legitimate business . It was , simply enough , the title and crest upon my visiting card that overcame their resistance and caused them to come to ' : attention , salute , and throw open doors for me with flourishes . At last I reached the door in whose bracket rested the card with my dear one 's name inscribed upon it . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the ceremonial full-dress uniform of a famous Hussar regiment standing at attention at either side of this door . I could see at a glance that , had it not been for the inflexible etiquette which dictated every line of their bearing , they would have made bold to ask my concern as I was about to knock upon the door . One of them , indeed , did wheel toward me , click his burnished heels , bow , and inform me in rapid , sibilant Germanthat he believed the occupant of the chamber to be engaged . My own German was then extremely deficient , and indeed grew only slightly less so in consequence of my continuousdependence upon it in the course of the ensuing years . I managed briefly , however , to inform the young officer that I was expected , upon which he could but bow again and fall back to his position of attention . I knocked upon the door and was more than a little amused to observe the gaping astonishment upon the dull face of the objectionable Dora as she opened it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in silent warning , I handed the woman my card ; and after she had disappeared , waited with my heart pounding in a mingled state of expectation and consternation , since I could clearly hear the voices of my dear one and a man , exchanging remarks in clipped phrases . But almost at once Dora had thrown the door wide for me to enter . No sooner had I stepped into the room than I realized that something was amiss . I knew how great must be Madame Geyer 's surprise at my appearance , yet she extended her hand to me as if she had but seen me yesterday . Instantly I caught her telegraphic message . This was to be a prearranged call upon my part ; she had been expecting me . " Enufin , ' " she cried in gushing tones . " I have just been telling this charming gentleman of my long-standing appointment with you ! " The officer beside her , monocled and tightly corseted , miraculously compressed into the extreme of elaborately embellished uniform , drew himself up and favored me with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with a jerk as Madame Geyer made the introduction . I did not fail to catch the malignant gleam in his cold , gray eye , which , in its glass integument , reminded me of nothing so much as the orb of a fish seen through the side of a parlor aquarium . Madame Geyer chatted lightly and easily , in a flow of trivia of which I could hardly believe her the authoress . Here indeedwas a priceless glimpse of her versatility as an actress ! Even the luscious quality of her speaking voice was thinned and heightened to the conventional treble of the woman of society . " And such an unusual contretemps , too , " she was saying , " that the one evening when I broke my rule of soli '  |p113tude  after singing , I had promised to my old friend from Paris ! He is passing through Berlin , you understand .... " She looked up from her low stool to bestow upon the angry Prussian a smile of sweetest ingenuousness . " You will be able to explain to his Imperial Highness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gruff ornament of the Imperial Court . " And now I will bid you a very good night . " He clicked his heels , bowed , turned to me , and in guttural French pronounced , " Your servant , sir ! " Then he wheeled , and marched with precise heavy steps to the door . The moment it closed behind him Dora slipped noiselessly forward and locked it . My dear one relaxed against the low back of her chair , flinging out her arms in a gesture of abandon . To my silent and horrified question she answered , muttering through her teeth , " The Crown Prince 's Equerry . " Instantly I possessed the formidable picture in all completeness , but even while I was burning with inward indignation , Madame Geyer sprang from her chair and flew to me with hands outstretched . " Thank you ! " she cried passionately in French . " You have saved my life ! Why , I have not had a chance to tell you how delightful this surprise really is  --  how delightful ! " She drew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am very glad to see you , Monsieur le Due ! " she exclaimed . I bent over her two hands which I held in a grip vibrating with emotion . " If you are really glad , " I made bold to say , " would you not repeat those precious words for the eager ears of Louis ? " She pressed my hands silently and turned to her mirror . " Let us go quickly where we can breathe , " she said . " The presence of that brute is stifling me in this room . " In a trice she had made her toilette , arraying herself as on the evening of our memorable first meeting , in the same nun 's robe of velvet , with her hair lying close and flat aspI 14 Dora had dressed it beneath the wig . She took her cloak from Dora , the same heavy woolen one I had first seen , and turned toward the door . Suddenly she stopped , and seizing Dora by the arm , whispered a flood of words into her ear in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my surprise , for , as the maid slipped into the corridor to make sure the way was clear  --  that was obviously what she had been directed to do  --  Madame Geyer favored me with one of her frequent gamine glances . " That , Monsieur , was my native tongue ! " She whirled the flaps of her cloak forward and hurried into the corridor . I knew it to be useless to inquire what the native tongue might be ; it sounded like Russian , yet I knew that it was not . I could surmise only that my darling was a member of one of the Slavic races , a novelty in my experience . When we were inside my carriage she turned to me and said suddenly , " After all , in Berlin you are not at home . We could go to Horcher or Borchardt  --  but . . . . Have you made a reservation ? " I had , indeed , gone so far as to reserve a salon at Borchardt , which I had been assured was a most excellent house , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mood sympathetic to such an environment , and promptly lied , as I smiled at her , " How could I dare presume that you would honor me at supper this evening ? " " You never presume , " was my delightful reward , " and this evening you are a guest in my domain . I have no home , it is true , " she murmured , " but I can feel remarkably at home in this forbidding city . Ask your coachman to drive to the Bristol . " For a moment I could not fully realize the privilege that was being bestowed upon my enraptured self  --  that it was to her own apartment I was being taken . And not until we werep115seated near a comfortable porcelain stove in her drawing room , with a waiter whom she called Franz der Laufer , to his vast delight , standing with his menu beside us , did I grasp the full import of my wonderful good fortune . I knew then that Lena Geyer would not have brought me there if she had not accepted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though I might yet wait through a weary period of longing , divine achievement would ultimately crown my hopes . Here in Berlin she differed from my fascinating creature of Paris . She was no less fascinating ; indeed , she seemed to me rather more so . But added to the scintillance and fragrance of her personality was a new quality , a straightforwardness , an earthiness , simply expressed . She looked at me with the beaming grin I had grown to love and said , " You are my first guest in my new home . This is truly a celebra-tion . " " You have only just come here to live ? " I asked her . " Naturally , " she answered . " I have only recently been able to afford it . " She glanced about the luxuriously furnishedparlor with its velvet chairs and shining grand piano . " I like to be comfortable , " she said with an apologetic smile , " but I can not say I am used to it . " She played the hostess like a child delighted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her solitary supper and now studied the menu with a frown of concentration . She looked up at her friend Franz der Laufer . " A real Wagner meal tonight , Franz , " she said in German , " and tell Dorfmann to send up the big Weinkarte . " When the knock upon the door announced that our supper was about to enter , she said to me , " You know , one feels like a gourmet in Paris , of course , but there is something about Germany that makes me love to eat . "  |p116We  were served with a meal absolutely German in origin and execution , which I must admit was superb . It had not , naturally , the finesse , the polish , the inspiration of our French culinary genius , but as a specimen of splendid preparation of fine materials , it was beyond reproach . My ultimateintimacy with every nuance of Lena Geyer 's tastes and nature served in many ways to broaden my own . As she had herself said , she loved to eat , which is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tastes were broader , her appetite less demanding of subtlety , and more capable of appreciating the hearty and the robust . She taught me , by degrees , the good features of her own point of view , to such an extent that before many weeks had passed I was drinking and positively enjoying beer , which I had hitherto considered a beverage fit only for servants and foreigners . Lena Geyer taught me that beer has a happy place in the scheme of food and drink , and that a taste for it is not incompatible with a fine gout for wines . Further , it was she who initiated my subsequent tremendous interest in the exquisite white wines of Germany ; and as a man of taste and justice I only too readily concede that in certain respects they have and can have no peer . On that evening she chose our wines , a Zeltinger Himmelreichto accompany the cold entree  --  Vorspeise , she advised me , was the correct term  --  of delicate smoked salmon from Norway , with Astrakhan caviar of the finest . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a point of succulent perfection , she had commanded a great Rheingau wine , a Rauenthaler Kesselring of the magnificent vintage of 1895 . Once I had overcome my natural astonishment at the service of two white wines successively , I applied myself to a fair judgment of this custom , justifiably necessitated by the limitationsof German viticulture . Though a noble Chambertinp117would far more richly have enhanced the flavor of the excellentgoose , I admitted readily that a noble Rhine wine benefitedit infinitely more than a poor red one . Then too , since it has ever been my wish to relieve the priceless name of Frenchman from the onus attaching to the somewhat valid charge of insularity , I was very glad to have this initiation into the tastes and customs of a foreign country . As we were finishing the superlative soufflee that completed our repast , I gazed across at my beloved with a look of frankest admiration . No man could more perfectly and knowingly have chosen the supper we had consumed , nor shown greater taste , and knowledge in the selection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have repelled me as too masculine and resourceful to appeal to a man of subtlety , this woman offered a powerfully exciting challenge in the vigor and independence of her nature . Characteristically her mood changed as soon as the couvert had been removed . She leaned back in her chair in a pensive attitude , and remained silent for a long interval , though she had previously shown the greatest animation . At last I made bold to ask her if her distraction was indicative of worry , for I felt only too certainly that such must be the case . She raised her head from its relaxed pose upon her hand , and gazed at me most earnestly in a moment of silence . Then she admitted in quiet tones that I had divined correctly ; she was indeed worried . " It is , my dear Louis "  --  how my heart leaped as this unexpected boon fell from her lips  --  " a question of the utmostdelicacy . It concerns his Imperial Highness . " I had divined that her distress had its source in this objectionablepersonality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The equerry of whose presence in her dressing room I had so providentially relieved her was not there atp118the instigation of the crown prince himself , but at that of his father the Emperor . As most of the world has learned from those gossips who follow court incumbencies by the publication of secrets properly to be buried in deepest oblivion , the heir to the throne had reached manhood without , so far as could be ascertained , ever having displayed a remote interest in women . His father , upon apprising himself of thF truth of this circumstance , necessarily distressful to a royal house , swore in comparatively public circumstances that he would see that his twenty-year-old son soon learned  --  and enjoyed  --  the prerogatives of a man and of a prince . The force of this imperial intention had been realized in the previous year when a young American singer attached to the Royal Opera had , rather unwillingly , become the mistress of the young heir to the throne , and had given birth to a son whose appearance did much to satisfy the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the shabbiest neglect , having deliberately forced her into the arms of its scion at the price of her position at the Opera , was but another revelation of its character . Quite naturally all members of the staff at the Opera knew of this shocking episode , and it may be left to the imaginationof the reader to picture the emotions of my beloved when , that very evening , as she returned to her dressing room , she was informed that the equerry of the crown prince was waiting upon her . She , however , being a woman of wit and tremendous independence , had instantly resolved upon a technique of evasion , to be supported until a moment when she could quietly decide upon a method of contending with this formidable problem . She knew at once that whether k r not the crown prince had of his own volition expressed a desire to associate with her , the Emperor would only too readily lend the weight of his authority toward the attainmentp119of this end . Therefore , she took it for granted that the invitation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which she had had the magnificent temerity to refuse , originated in the highest possible quarter . And if so , the consequences of her refusal would be dire indeed . She described to me the ruthlessness of the Emperor in dealing with any man or woman who opposed him  --  indeed it is well known that in the mind of Wilhelm , lese-majeste was a graver crime than treason , and that condign punishmentwas meted to the unhappy man or woman who dared ever to decline one of his invitations . Wilhelm was known to fly into rages so brutal as to indicate latent insanity , for causes less grievous than the one Lena Geyer had given his son tonight . She assured me that she felt confident of receiving , on the morrow , a dismissal from the Royal Opera and a banishment from the country . To my ears , accustomed to the liberal usages of democracy , which , even while I deploredit , I could acknowledge upon grounds of justice , this prediction sounded too preposterous to believe . However , Madame Geyer cited to me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who had been banished from the Germanstates by royal edict for having had the audacity to expect compensation for a command concert , rendered at a moment 's notice upon an evening when she was already fatiguedafter an appearance with the Berlin Philharmonic . I admitted that my dear one 's fears were not entirely imaginary . But so vastly did my indignation swell , so fiercely did I struggle to control a verbal outburst of vituperation and disgust toward this royal patron , that I managed only with difficulty to view the problem in the light of detachment . Appalled by this picture of Lena Geyer , one of the truly eminent artists of her world , ejected in disgrace from herp120tenure at the world-famous Berlin Opera , I presently asked what she would or could do in that event to protect her public reputation and assure herself of a fixture as enhancing to her identity as that of prima donna of the Berlin Royal Opera . Would she , for example , transfer her fixed attachmentto our Opera at Paris , which , we both knew well , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this honor ? She explained to me , and I was greatly interested in the inner motives that must direct an operatic career , that while a permanent contract with the Paris Opera was always a desideratum , it was advisable in her case always to appear there as a guest artist because of her desire to be identified primarily with the music of Wagner . As I have previously noted , this music in Paris was sung necessarily in French , and not even the most vehement Chauvinist could pretend that our Paris performances of the Wagner classics could compare with those at the great German houses . " No , " she said , shaking her head , " I could not go to Paris now . I must remain identified with a great German opera house until  --  " she paused . I asked her to complete her thought . To what was she , clearly , referring , and to what was she looking forward ? She smiled , with an expression rather more wistful and gentle than I had ever contemplated upon her dear face . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " To the Metropolitan . That will come in good time , but the time is not yet ripe . Meanwhile , I must work and develop here . " " But if you are denied the opportunity of singing at the Berlin Opera , " I protested , " then where , my dear , can you pursue that development ? " " There is but one other house , " she replied . " That is Vienna . " " And why not ? " I demanded . " Why would the Vienna 1z Opera not be vastly delighted to obtain your incomparableservices ? " " It would have been , some two years ago , " she replied , " but at that time I made the fatal mistake of declining the post that was offered me . I did so out of loyalty toward the Berlin Opera where I made my first success . " "  --  And now ? She rested her head upon her hand again . " One never receives a second invitation from the Hofoper . It is the proudest musical organization in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play upon all facets of this grievous question and suddenly , as those thoughts will that are so often destined to have far-reaching and profound effects , two quick ideas flashed across my brain . The first  --  the universally well-known detestation in which the Austrian Emperor held the German one . The second  --  that the French Ambassador at Vienna had the heaven-sent grace to be an old and close friend of my dear late father 's ; our families had possessed neighboring estates for centuries . All in a moment the distressing tangle of facts and emotions seemed to fall into orderly line in my hands . In a few words I apprisedmy dear one of the simple plan that had unfolded in my mind . No sooner had I expressed it in words than it began to take shape in fact . Taking pen and paper , I wrote in entire detail to our Ambassador in Vienna the whole unpleasantstory , not omitting the characteristic behavior of Kaiser Wilhelm and of his heir . I went on to tell the Marquisof Madame Geyer 's motives of loyalty , which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be her feeling now if given an opportunity to reconsider her refusal of Vienna . I hardly needed to add , though I did not fail to avail myself of the pleasure of a hint , what a service the French Ambassador might be doing the court to which he was accredited , should he see fit quietly to act in the matter , and to convey it to the attention of the powers concerned . I closed with a fervent assurance of my gratitude for his intercession , particularly if action could be undertaken with all possible haste , in view of Madame Geyer 's momentary suspense . Taking a hasty leave of my dear one , and with all possible speed , I repaired to the lodgings of young Comte Jean-Marie de Savelure , an attache of our Berlin Embassy whom I had known well during his last tenure in Tokyo . With his assistance I obtained a trusted messenger who was directed to proceed with the greatest speed to Vienna , and to present my letter instantly to the Ambassador , in person . As I parted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interest and assistance , and requested me , if I was not otherwise occupied , to wait upon her at midmorningof the following day . I was of course only too overjoyedto be of service , and to be permitted this intimate participation in her affairs . When I was ushered into her drawingroom the next morning she was seated at her desk , dressed entirely in close-fitting black , relieved only by a small ruching of white at the high collar . To me she seemed magnificent ; a Norn , a Fate , most awe-inspiring in her pride and dignity . Silently she handed me a note headed by the imperial crest , which informed her that , as the Court Chamberlain , accompanied by the Intendant of the Royal Opera , was preparing to wait upon her at five o'clock that afternoon , she would kindly have the goodness to be at home . " You see , " she said indifferently . I could with difficulty realize the enormity of the crudeness , yes , the bestiality , that would stoop to such incredible means of satisfying @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of superb control and detachment , even though I know how deeply her splendid pride in herp123work and her ideals had been injured . Gestures of consolationand reassurance were necessarily excluded from my words to her . Instead , I glanced at my watch and remarked that as it was not quite noon , we had more than four good hours before us in which to take the air  --  it was a beautiful day  --  lunch , and otherwise entertain each other in the teeth of these disgusting circumstances . With splendid verve and humor she threw off her cold abstraction and arose from her chair with alacrity , calling to Dora to bring her wraps . I excusedmyself on the plea of a telegram I must send before our sortie , and from a private telephone in the office of the hotel , I communicated with Jean-Marie de Savelure at the Embassy , telling him that if any word arrived from Vienna after four that afternoon I wished to receive it in Madame Geyer 's apartment at the Bristol . I then rejoined my dear one , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough day out of doors , interrupted by a splendid luncheon with which we regaled ourselves at the justly famous restaurant of Horcher . It was only the providence of a merciful deity that had permitted my messenger to catch an express that brought him to Vienna by noon of that day . At half an hour after four , my dear one was seated calmly in her drawing room , displayinga poise , a sang-froid , that would have done justice to the haughtiest grande dome of Paris . Nevertheless , even a less practised and interested eye than mine could have observedthat she was painfully nervous , and with each tick of the clock growing more so . She anticipated the suggestion upon the tip of my tongue , that we occupy the interval with some distracting game , by asking me suddenly if I played cribbage . I assured her that I did , whereupon she requested Dora to bring the board . However , promptly upon the stroke of five , I withdrew to an adjoining chamber , in spite of my dear one 's request that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the interview . I knew too well that the sight of myself in intimate attendance upon her would serve only more to incense the representatives of the Emperor , to whom they would report me as being the primary reason for Lena Geyer 's defiance . This was not the case , though I should have been proud had it been so ; and I was not willing that some more refined and far-reaching specimen of vengeance be visited upon her because of me . I must admit that in this entire episode , the woman Dora , for whose existence I was at last beginning to concede some reason , behaved with complete discretion and intelligence . After admitting the Court Chamberlain and the Intendant of the Royal Opera to Madame Geyer 's presence , she joined me in the connecting room , and waited with me , as I had directed , for developments . I heard through the door the stentorian tones of the Chamberlain reading aloud a decree of dismissal , without cause , from the staff of the Royal Opera , followed by an edict @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence fell upon the termination of his gratingand guttural words , there was a quiet knock upon the door of the chamber where I was waiting . I opened to admit a messenger from the French Embassy , who handed me a confidential telegraphic dispatch from Vienna . In a word it contained assurance of the highest Austrian authority 's delight in this opportunity , and included an invitation to Madame Geyer to proceed at once to Vienna , to join the Hofoper as one of the leading sopranos , with all emoluments and honors . Folding the message , I handed it to Dora with the direction to give it at once to her mistress . Upon Dora 's return to me I could not resist the overwhelming temptation to place my chair close to the door and listen to the conversa/tion taking place between my dear one and her insulting callers . " I acknowledge peremptory dismissal , without cause , from the Royal Opera at the instigation of His Imperial Majesty , " she said in tones so nobly clear and firm that my heart pounded with pride . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her native tongue , so fluent and classical was her command of it , so exquisite her inflection . Though I heard it commonly spoken with the spitting gutturals that made it repulsive to the sensitive ear , her pronunciation was the ideal of that language at its best , a best that would have caused Goethe himself to contemplate Lena Geyer with affectionand pride . She continued : " I shall proceed immediately to obey the edict of expulsion from the realm . Before I depart , however , I beg the privilege of asking the honorable representative of his Imperial Majesty whether my dismissal from the Opera , and the related circumstances , are to be released to the press ? " I heard the growling voice of the Chamberlain saying , " Certainly not . Certainly not . This matter is of no possible concern to the public . " " Nevertheless , " Lena Geyer replied in an even tone , " the Lord Chamberlain will acknowledge that an artist 's career depends to no small extent upon the interest and good will of the public , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will be released to the press tomorrow by my manager , that I am leaving Berlin for Vienna , where I have been engaged as a permanent member of the Hofoper with all emoluments relative to the status of ranking prima donna . " Until my dying day I shall regret the closed door that preventedmy seeing the face of that beastly court puppet as those words fell upon his incredulous ears . My dear one 26assured me that his consternation , followed by a wave of fury that turned him scarlet from the base of his shaved neck to the top of his bald pate , was a sight long to be remembered . In a transport of eagerness for him to be gone , I waited palpitatingly beside the door while formal remarks were made in termination of the interview . At last I heard the click of the salon door and the heavy tread of the men as they proceeded down the corridor . Then I opened the door at which I had so unblushingly been eavesdropping . My dear one was still sitting erect upon her divan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain and stress in her beautiful eyes . As I entered she rose suddenly and  --  how can I express the turmoil , the sweet agony , the sacred import of that moment ?  --  threw herself into my arms . Silently I held her close to my heart , my lip pressed to her fragrant hair , my limbs trembling from overwhelming emotion . It is only to be expected that when I found my voice I whispered to her such outpourings of passionate love as I had never voiced in all my life before . The full meaning of that single sweetest moment of my life can not be conveyed in this medium , nor , to be truthful , do I wish it to be . It must remain forever the secret of my heart . At last our tears ceased to flow and with my pocket-handkerchiefwe dried each other 's wet eyes and cheeks . I shall never attempt to describe the ineffable delights of the ensuing evening ; the dinner in the doubly precious intimacy of her salon ; the cold drive in the Tiergarten under a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apartment , where I accompaniedher by tacit understanding , and from which I did not depart . It was in the last unearthly , tender , tenuous moment before she surrendered to my adoring love that I held her apart from me , gripping her beautiful broad shoulders and gazing deep into those noble , earnest eyes.  | 27 " You are not acting from gratitude ? " I asked her , hoarsewith emotion . " You must not reward me for anything . Ihave done nothing , nothing in all the world but worship you . " She smiled gently and placed her fingers upon my brow . " No , " she said slowly , " it is not gratitude . " " It may not be love either , " I said , " because you have never known what love can be . " " That is true , Louis . " " Then by all that is sacred , " I vowed , placing my hand upon her hair , " you shall know . "  |p128UPON  the five o'clock express to Vienna the following afternoon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ When we entered our wagon-lit salon my dear one could find no words to express her pleasure . My intelligentservant had converted the plain railway compartment into a bower of flowers and a sanctum of little luxuries . Disposedupon the divan was an inviting arrangement of dainty , perfumed cushions . Across its foot lay a rug I had taken time to purchase that morning ; a very dream of a travelling rug , confected of palest cafe-au-lait velvet and lined with mink fur . Upon the table nearby stood the dressing case that was to surprise her as my first gift , a veritable work of art in hand-polished morocco leather , equipped with every possible toilet accessory that elegance could wish , executed in crystal and gold . As I purchased the little treasure that morninglinter den Linden , how keenly I regretted that I had not had the foresight to do so at home in Paris , where I felt that my exacting standards would have been met by even greater perfection ! However , I must admit that it would have been the overly critical woman who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My dear one was more pleased than a child ; she seated herself upon the divan , leaned back against the cushions , drew the rug over her knees , broke off a rose and posed it in her hair , held her dressing case open between her hands , and raised her dear face to mine for a kiss that I gave from a heart nigh to bursting for happinessp129It was this thoroughness , this richness and completeness of appetite and participation that held me to the woman I loved with unwavering power . So generous , so lavish was her nature , that once having taken the step of surrendering to my love , she made no petty and commonplace reservations . She did not tease , she did not tantalize . True , in many women 's natures such mischievous elements add to their charms , but the playfulness  --  and how celestial it was !  --  in Lena 's nature expressed itself in other ways , and served equally to spice my existence with the delights of the unexpected . If she , from time to time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew beyond all doubt that coquetry had no part in her motives . She was frankly not in the mood , and at such times I knew that her abstraction might almost invariablybe ascribed io the exactions of her art . I learned that a singer above all other women is consecrated to the demands of her physique ; that the man who could refuse to allow this inarguable reality to take precedence over his desires would be a fool and a brute as well . The hours of our journey passed in transports of delight . Ever a brave and a clear-thinking person , my dear one had set her face resolutely forward toward this great challenge that circumstance had flung her way ; for while she could not have been said to have entertained great affection for Berlin or for its opera , it was nevertheless closely identified with her beloved Lilli Lehmann , whose teaching had brought her to eminence and perfection , and through whose offices she had received her engagement at Berlin . Lena had gone that last afternoon to Grunewald to take her farewell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chain of events that precipitated the flight to Vienna . It would have been entirely within the bounds of possibility for Lena to have appealed to Frau Lehmann to intercede in the matter of the royal edict ,  |p130and  there is small reason to doubt that the great woman , of whom even Royalty itself stood in awe on artistic grounds , could have brought about a reversal of the imperial decrees . My beloved , however , was both too proud and too witty to concur in such a proposal . At best , her continuing tenure at Berlin would have furnished material for court gossip and professional intrigue ; at worst , the Intendant would have contrived , at instigation from high places , to keep her upon the roster of singers , yet never to put her upon the stage , and to prevent her appearing elsewhere . It was far better to do as we had done and in this Frau Lehmann readily agreed . I do know that Lena , in recounting the tale to her , omitted mention of myself and of the small part I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was as well in view of Frau Lehmann'sinevitable and one may say bigoted disapproval of my part in her pupil 's life . In the morning we reached Vienna , where we were met at , the station by the charge d'affaires of our Embassy , who was literally bubbling with good spirits and with exuberance of welcome . In a word , during the drive from the railway stationto Sacher 's , where suites had been reserved for Madame Geyer and for me , he recounted to us the delight with which the Ambassador 's message had been received in high quarters . The disgust aroused in the breasts of the Emperor and of his advisers by the account of the Hohenzollerns ' behavior was only exceeded by the alacrity with which they all agreed that Lena Geyer must consent to grace the Hofoper with her presence and her art . The opera director , when consulted , had instantly assured his interviewers that the place he had offered Madame Geyer some eighteen months previously was still most emphatically vacant , and that he considered the acquisition of her services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ organization in the world . Accordingly ,  |p131u|pon  her entrance into her suite , she found a large basket of beautiful flowers upon the centre table , together with the card of the Intendant of the Hofoper , who would , he wrote , do himself the honor of calling upon her that afternoon , at five o'clock . I had directed Pierre to reserve at the delightful Sacher 's two suites upon different etages , as I did not wish my dear Lena 's initial dealings with her new sponsors to be in any way complicated or affected by her newly initiated relationship with me . Although I had been blessed with the opportunityof bringing about this happy move to Vienna through the fortunate accident of my father 's intimacy with the Ambassador , I was convinced that it would be the course of wisdomfor me to divorce myself as thoroughly as possible from participation in her professional affairs . To this resolution I clung unfalteringly , expressing opinions only when specificallyinvited to do so by my dear one . And a wise course it proved to be . How glorious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Added to the glamour of fashion , luxury , gaiety , the magnificence of the aristocracy , the elegance of their entertainments , and the abandon of the young bloods in their hours of carousal , was the great and serious glory of the artistic life of that splendid capital . Those were the days of Gustav Mahler 's unequalled work at the Hofoper , days when the world 's greatest voices and one of the world 's greatest orchestras were all gathered under his aegis in that rich temple of art . Many are the discerning men and women who will tell you now , thirty years later , that Mahler'sperformances of the works of Wagner and Mozart remainunsurpassed in subsequent history ; and there are many , like myself , who can not control their emotion at the recollection of Beethoven 's Fidelio as he used to conduct it with 2my darling in the title role . It can be imagined how vast was his delight upon finding himself unexpectedly endowed with the direction of this sublime voice ; how warm was his appreciation , and how intent his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Geyer was equivalent to the certainty of perfection . This quick-tempered and difficult man , whose musical ideals were of the very highest , whose work had elicited unstintedpraise from the lips of Brahms , and whose standards brooked no possible compromise in quality and execution , became very shortly a staunch friend to my Lena . Where it was his usual fate to quarrel with colleagues , artists , and managers alike , to leave every tenure at the height of his best work because of his inability to co-operate with other personalities , his affection for " meine Geyer , " as he always called her , never suffered the slightest shadow . Doubtless the roots of this splendid mutual devotion lay in her ability to meet his inexorable musical standards , and in her serious and willing musicianship , to which most prima donnas have neither the intelligence , the stamina , the patience , nor the humility to apply themselves . Once when we had the pleasure of Herr and Frau Mahler 's company at supper he turned to me and exclaimed , " To tell this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is to do is like telling it to a messenger from God . You can not believe it will be done beyond your earthly hopes  --  but it is ! " It can be imagined what was Mahler 's joy upon arriving in New York for some guest appearances at the Metropolitan in 1908 , to find his Geyer there , assigned to many of the leading roles ; and small wonderthat his ensuing accomplishment was memorable . So kind and so considerate , in comparison with the surly truculence of the Berlin officials , was the treatment accorded Lena by the Intendant of the Hofoper and all his staff , thatp133she seemed incredulous of her good fortune . When I avowed that it was after all no more than her due , she thanked me for my extravagant opinion but said , with the reality so characteristic of her fine , clear thinking : " Yes , mon ami , but remember they have not heard me sing yet ! " Which was not , of course , strictly true , since most of them had at one time or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concern to hear her at other houses in Europe . There was some discussion as to the best vehicle for her impendingdebut , one of the authorities speaking for Sieglinde , which he had heard during one of her guest appearances at Geneva , and Herr Mahler for Elisabeth , chiefly , he said , because she was undoubtedly the greatest living exponent of the role ( though he had not yet heard her sing it for proof ) . So , Elisabeth it must be , since Herr Mahler at that time had the last word in all decisions at the Hofoper . In honor of the occasion she decided that she must have a new costume , which was made with such art and mastery of detail that she vowed Vienna was the only place , hereafter , where she would have her opera costumes made . The crown was quite fine , a beautiful piece of filigree each of whose points was mounted with a large artificial pearl . And for the occasion I presented her with my first gift of jewels , a brooch marvellouslyconceived of diamonds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ centre ; that stone above all others which glowed in harmony with her eyes , and reflected the vigor and depth of her personality . She allowed me to enter her dressing room for a brief moment just before the performance , when I found her completelydressed and ready to go on , sitting quietly with the open score before her upon the table , as if she had not already sung the role fifty times ! But her rehearsals with Herr Mahler had opened new vistas before her , and she wasp134determined to reveal them with all the power of her genius . I had not seen my beloved for over twenty-four hours , having only too willingly concurred in her request for absolutequiet and solitude before this portentous hour . Now she greeted me with a gentle smile , almost as impersonal as she would have bestowed upon a total stranger , which I understoodquite clearly as being all she could rally for me from the utter concentration of her emotions and forces in another direction . I bent over her and fastened my jewel upon the front of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smile , then whispered a tender word of thanks in my ear , and indicated ruefully her lips and cheeks , heavily masked in grease-paint and therefore not to be kissed as I so longed to do . Instead I embraced her hands , which I noted were steady and firm as they clasped mine , though quite cold , and withdrew , promising to come for her after the performance . The audience was brilliant beyond the power of my simple pen to describe . The Emperor Franz Josef was in his imposingcentral box , and stretching about the circle to the right and left of him were all the great nobles of his realm , accompanied by their ladies dressed and coiffed and bejewelled to a degree of elegance that could not have been outdone anywhere , even in Paris . The spectacle of the beautiful auditorium , with its vast orchestra-pit that so honored and featuredthe incomparable Philharmoniker that played in it , the glittering lights , the rich riot of color from the officers ' uniforms , the sparkling reflection of a million diamonds and other jewels , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in our Ambassador 's box ; and he chose to look upon the occasion as the most important event of his season . I had several days previously warned my darling that there was nop135way , in the light of courtesy and convention , for me to refusehis invitation and that there would , equally , be no way to refuse him should he request the honor of a presentation to her after the performance . She admitted instantly that the service and honor done her by the Ambassador were such as to make her preference for solitude impossible to adhere to upon this occasion , and that I might bring him if he did her the honor of requesting that I do so . My impatience during the two scenes of the first act remainsto this day a tortuous memory . Though the mezzosopranowho sang Venus was the first I had heard who did full justice to the part , I could think of nothing and listen to nothing , so passionately was my attention fixed upon my dear one , quiet and calm in her room , where @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nerves . I did not , however , fail to note the glorious playing of the orchestra , or the magnificent beat and perfection of detail in the conductingof Mahler . I had never heard such playing , and further , had never seen a fashionable audience so completely aware of what it was hearing , and attentive to the last man and woman . This feature of the Viennese musical life struck me in profound contrast to the trivial attitude of society in Paris and London . During the first intermission the corridors were filled with handsome officers and gentlemen in the height of full-dress elegance , most of them gleaming with honors and decorations , on their way to call upon the ladies holding court in the boxes . Like a child , I trembled with apprehension lest some of them overstay their time and in returning late to their places cause commotion at the moment when the curtain should rise . I need not have worried ; when the lights went down the house was quiet as a church , and vibrant with a strong emotion of anticipation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ curtains swept apart and there she was  --  not my darling , not the passionate woman so recently surrendered to my adoration , but the radiant virgin of all the world , exuberant , pure , with joy and beatitude flowingfrom every line of her face and body . In the brief momentthat she stood silent while the orchestra played the introductionwith fire and clarity such as I had never heard , there was a tangible thrill of delight all through the crowded house . As the first electric phrase rang from her throat my heart ceased to beat , my limbs grew cold , I might have died for the acute pain of ecstasy and pride that overwhelmed me . She was in her finest voice , and as the evening progressed , I confess to secret speculation whether the initiation of her relationship with me had not somewhere released a flow of new power , new richness , new liquidity and fire into her incredible throat . These were the first notes I had heard her sing since receiving the ineffable gift of her love , and indeed she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All about me were men and women thunderstruck with delight and incredulity , for it is true that while Lena Geyer always gave a splendid performance , that was one of the nights when she outdid herself , and boldly scaled the very heights of Olympus , carrying her captivated hearers in her wake . Technically , the explanation for her unearthly performancelay in the inspiration of Mahler ; never before had she sung under such direction , with such an orchestra . Then too her acting was , as always , so powerfully imaginativeand expressive that it struck the new public as a novelty ; the reputation that had preceded her to Vienna had declared her the possessor of a historic voice , but had not so fully prepared them for her talents on the stage . Her triumph was of fullest possible measure , overflowing , and intoxicating to everyone under that roof . She herselfp137accepted it with the most appealing charm ; as her colleagues in the cast broke the firm convention of the company and repeatedly left her alone before the curtain to receive the wild plaudits @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ smilingin unaffected delight and finally flinging out her arms in a warm gesture as if to take all Vienna to her heart . Indeed , it might well be said that she did that very thing . At the conclusion of the performance my host , the French Ambassador , lost no time in expressing his fervent wish to meet Madame Geyer . I told him of the rare exception she was to make to her usual rule , in his behalf , and conducted him backstage , where she was awaiting us . He had no more than bowed over her hand before I perceived an expression of greatest warmth upon his austere and aristocratic countenance ; and when he withdrew to permit her to make her toilette before the supper at which she was to honor us with her presence , he pressed my arm and murmured his admirationin no equivocal terms . " I congratulate you , mon fils , " he said with the greatest empressement . " I should conclude that you must be the happiest and most fortunate of men . That is a magnificent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be , according to her contract , resident in Vienna for at least five months of the year , she decided , from a natural desire for privacy as well as from other motives , to take a flat in a suitable quarter , which I rented furnished with all the luxuries that had belonged to the late member of royalty who had used it when he sought seclusion . This charming little home was situated in that part of the city known as the dritter Bezirk , not far from the Schwarzenberg palace and gardens , and close to the great embassies . It was but a short walk to the Ring where it occasionallygave us pleasure to promenade on a beautiful after- noon , and where I dearly loved to patronize the exquisite shops , with whose wares of jewels and needlework and preciouslaces it was my delight to adorn my beloved . I am aware that I am not alone among my countrymen in having succumbed to a lively and long-lasting affection for ' Vienna ; it seems to me to be , indeed , the only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in atmosphere , cultivation , and beauty . In those days it had as well an aura of the most enchanting verve and gaiety . I retained my suite at Sacher 's hotel , where I was made more comfortable than I have ever been away from my own home , and was highly amused at the report rendered by my servant Pierre incident to this circumstance . He assured me that had my own title and birth not been such as to impress Frau Sacher with my close relationship to that gentleman who , in a better world , would be enjoying his divine rights upon the throne of France , she would have remained comparativelyindifferent to my comfort , and , under certain circumstances , to my presence in her establishment . She was well known as the consultant and confidante of most of the distinguished nobles of the Austro-Hungarian realm , and it finally came to my knowledge that when a particularly distinguishednoble whispered leading questions about the Hofoper'snew prima donna into Frau Sacker 's capacious ear , she retorted that the lady 's affections were already permanently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nationality , was fully as cerulean as his own ! One most interesting episode marked the early days of our stay in Vienna . After my dear one 's prodigious triumph at her debut she consented to receive a representative of the press , who sought to obtain such biographical details from her as would lend interest to the comment he was preparing for the perusal of an eager public . I was present at the inter/view , and could not but feel the greatest interest when the young man , who was mannerly enough , inquired of what country Madame Geyer was a citizen . She stared at him a moment with rather a puzzled expression upon her countenanceand presently answered  --  " Why  --  I suppose of this one ! " My own astonishment was only less great than my curiosity , for the mystery , whether or not intentional , as to my beloved 's background and antecedents , had for some time occupied my thoughts with persistence . The amazement of her interviewer was striking . " Then you are not German , Gnadige ! " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paused . " May I take the liberty of inquiring where you were born ? " " I was born in Prague . " The young man sat back with an expression of astonishment , slowly superseded by enlightenment . " I see , " he exclaimedslowly . " Now the source of your magnificent naturalmusicianship is no longer a mystery . You are of Bohemian descent ? " My dear one nodded . " I am , " she answered . " And I spent my childhood there . Since then I have travelled a great deal and have never thought of myself as the citizen of any particularcountry . Art is international and the distinctions of birthplace and language should not have any bearing upon the artist 's point of view . " " Quite so , " agreed her interrogator . " But I think you will discover that upon being apprised that you are its compatriot , your Austrian public will feel even warmer toward you , if possible , than it does now . " " That would be very pleasant , " replied Lena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not held in high regard in Vienna , in fact that they refused to call themselves Austrians . "  | " That is so in some cases , particularly of political zealots , " the young man said , " but according to your own words , you have no such feeling . " My dear one nodded . " In that case , " he said , " you will be in a position to enjoy all the popularity of an Austrian citizen without any of the stigma that sometimes unfortunately attaches to the Czech identity . I congratulate you . " So remote were political considerations from my Lena 's thoughts ! Yet the time was to come when she was to pay dearly for her broad point of view in this regard , and to wish that her identity as an Austrian had never been so firmly and enthusiastically fixed upon her by an adoring publicand a gracious Emperor . To me the revelation was fascinating ; at last I understood the elusive , tantalizing Slavic strain , the facility in an unintelligible language , and indeed in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of any country where she might find herself . I believe it was due more to the single answer rendered by Frau Sacher to her noble interrogator than to any other factor , that Lena was not more avidly sought by the gay habitues of stage door and dressing room . There were many who did hope to be received by her , many and many the beautifulbasket of flowers that reached her with the card of some eager prince or archduke . With tact and charm she succeeded in refusing the attentions of all these suitors , never giving offense , never seeming unaware of the honor they wished to confer , never giving me any cause for jealousy or putting me into what would have been a supremely mortifying position  --  that of contending for her favor against rivals who in a manner of speaking were my hosts in a country that I had entered uninvited . Naturally , such being the nature of gossipp141in a cosmopolitan capital , it was not many weeks before those who felt themselves concerned were all well apprised of the status of affairs @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alone as a matter of course in court circles , to which my name and titles bore unquestionable entree . At the same time , in her company , I was accepted among the musical people who were her friends . In the ordinary sense of the word , Lena was not a social person ; she did not care for random gatherings and she felt at ease only when with me , or in a group of friends all of whom had the same interestsas herself . The effect of her personality upon most people who knew her was to cause them to love her extravagantly and demonstratively ; if she felt some reciprocal affection she was pleased with their company , but if she were at all indifferent , she found their devotion burdensome and made an especial effort to avoid them . It would be futile to pretend that there were not awkward features of my liaison with my beloved Lena . It is no reflectioneither upon her humble birth or upon her conspicuous profession to note that in the days of our happiness , and indeed until the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ courtesies of a finer world , an opera singer was in no way the peer of a noblewoman or a gentlewoman of distinguishedbirth . It would have been entirely unthinkable that I introduce my dear one to my honored mother , or to any of the ladies whose charge it was to uphold the conventions and regulations of our cultivated society . It is also true that these ladies existed perforce in a milieu intolerably dull in comparison with the brilliant world of art that I penetrated in order to win my beloved . She , unlike so many poorly advisedand ill-conducted of her colleagues , was too proud , too intelligent , and too ambitious in her legitimate field to permit herself to be waylaid by fruitless hopes of admission intop142the rigid circles of society into which I was born . She was , rather , oblivious of such circles , and seemed always to take it entirely for granted that if , in visiting a foreign capital , I were invited to dine with royalty or nobility , she must be omitted from the list of guests . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I preferred to be alone with her was well understood between us . It was also understood from those first ecstatic days in Vienna , that I would arrange my affairs so as to be free to accompany her wherever she might go . I grieved at thus sorely disappointing my dear mother , but I had sworn to show Lena what true and tender love might be , and my conception of my duty , as well as my supreme pleasure , in that respect , was to be always at hand . Thus my own life was necessarily as nomadic as hers . For four glorious and precious years , our routine was almost invariably the same . We spent the months from November until March in Vienna . On about the first of April we would make the sweetest and tenderest of all pilgrimages , returning to Paris , where we remained for the two delicious months of spring in a transport of happiness , while she sang at the Opera . In June and early July we were in London for the Covent Garden season , an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was undeniably important in her career . At midsummer we returned to the Continent , to pass our holidays in whatever spot our fancy might decree ; always it was secluded , always in some comfortablehouse that I rented for the period of our stay , staffing it with my own servants from Paris and Chartres , who possessed as none others possibly could the ability to make us comfortable . From time to time we made journeys to capitals where my dear one was engaged for guest performances ; to St. Petersburg , to Stockholm , to Warsaw , to Munich , where her triumph was so uproarious as to reach thepI43ears of the Emperor in Berlin and cause him to repent his folly of 1902 . As time went on , it warmed my heart to observe the increasingtenderness and demonstrativeness of her feeling for me . As a man of experience I had been only too well aware , upon the inception of our love , that the weight of devotion and expression was all upon my side . My dear one , as I had so correctly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ indeed had cause  --  though I was not then completelyenlightened about it to fear and hate the physical expression of love . Thus I knew how cautiously I must demonstrate that art whose mysteries and ecstasies have no proper place in a published chronicle . I had been correct in my surmise that , once her fear and repulsion were skilfully and tenderly dispelled , she would be ardent , eager , and passionatein the extreme , which proved most rapturously to be the case . Never can I forget the new and galvanic overtone in her divine voice on that initial appearance in Vienna which followed our first happiness ; and that , indeed , was long before she had learned or dared fully to respond to my fervent love . As she grew more confident of herself and more trustful of me , she voiced , occasionally , a new fear whose possible basis of reality had never occurred to me ; that if she grew too secure , too relaxed , too normal ( she said ) in her relation with me , there would be a corresponding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were , as God has been good enough to decree that lovers shall be , very sentimental , and among a thousand little ceremonies that endeared this or that day or occasion to our memories , was the anniversary of our flight to Vienna , which had so gloriously precipitated our love . The second anniversary of this occasion fell upon the day preceding one of Lena 's appearances at the Hofoper . We had known , some days in advance , of this prospective interference with the delight that would ordinarily have marked our celebration , but we accepted it in good part , particularly as Lena was to sing Donna Anna , and she made it a point invariably to give her superb best to Mozart . She had been taught to do this by both her teachers , and she considered it in the nature of a rite . Therefore we agreed , perforce , to be content with a quiet early dinner at her flat , after which I should withdraw and she should go at once to bed . I arrived in good time , bringing with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a broad flexible band , to be worn about her throat , of diamonds and pink pearls . She had chosen to greet me with a new robe , soft and flowing like those she wore after changing from her stage costumes , but fashioned of a pale-colored fabric in contrast to the deep tones of the other gowns it resembled . It was made of velvet in a creamy rose shade that matched exactly the nuances of my pearls . I clasped the ornament about her throat . Never had I seen her look so beautiful , never had her dear face glowed with such tender radiance , and never had I desired her more ardently . Her mood was ravishing  --  gentle , quiet  --  the very essence of her wish to make me happy , tempered with the wistful knowledge that I must soon leave her . We partookof our dinner seated side by side upon a small divan in her salon  --  so intimate and tender were our feelings that we wished not to be separated even by the width of her dining table . That , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that had arrived from France the previous day at my order ; so was the Romanee that had been transferred months before from my cellar at Chartres . Pierre waited upon us at his own insistence . The good fellow had grown so devoted to Madame that always when I dined or supped with her he chose to dress me as quickly as possible , then to rush in a fiacre to herp145flat where he admitted me with a formal flourish as if he had not , a quarter of an hour previously , helped me into my clothes at Frau Sacher 's . When he withdrew , leaving us to finish our wine , I raised my glass and gazing intently into my darling 's great glowing eyes , I pledged anew my love and passionate devotion . She responded in her luscious voice with words far beyond any verbal expression she had ventured before . We embraced ; tortured by the burning ecstasy in her eyes , I closed them with my lips ; she sighed and drooped upon my breast . In a word , we were lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did all else in the world outside . I rose and drew her , blind with desire , into her chamber . Next morning she stared at me over her coffee with the round , frightened eyes of a guilty child . She was speechless with worry . Having said once that she was sure she would give a bad performance that evening , and having been silenced by me with the assurance that she must not think such nonsense , she remained silent , thinking it , I knew , all the more . I suggested a drive in the Prater , secretly fearful lest her usual morning walk exact too much of her energy . It was not , however , her muscular energy about which I was concerned . It would have been wiser had I not gone to her dressingroomfor my brief greeting before the performance , but worry drew me there , and for the first time since I had known her I saw my Lena in a state of definite nervous fear . She hardly noticed my presence ; she was standing in the corner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and attempting to do breathing exercises in which she would interrupt herself to snap irritably at the maid in Czech . Nobody in the world understood Lena Geyer better than that ugly , mysterious , devoted servant , and herp146only reaction to the scolding was to throw surly glances at me quite as if to fix me as the cause of her mistress 's distress . The woman was no fool , though her manners were atrocious . I withdrew without speaking to Lena and sought my place in the house . Lena 's performance was not good . To be sure , what was poor singing for her would have been most women 's best , but she had no sooner opened her mouth than I knew her fears were justified . The average listener could not have told she was below her standard , but I knew , and I was not the only member of the audience who did know . Every singer has her off-days , and one whose record was as flawless as Lena Geyer 's would never have been harshly criticised for a slight deviation from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was at fault ; rather it was in the quality of her voice , which in some way she failed to project across the footlights with the electric force that the public had grown to worship . Or sai chi l'onore was the dramatic aria where she usually displayed her fiery power most dazzlingly . And to my horrified and incredulous grief , Lena did not dazzle that night . I wondered how Mahler must have felt in his pit , for he had grown to rely upon her as upon his own right hand , and to have her big aria merely adequate , well-sung , but not the Donna Anna that always sent the audience away raving must have been a profound shock . Heartsick , I waited for the Non mi dir , which went better , chiefly because it demandedless of the artist , and in the reduced scope of her voice that night , she could negotiate it better than the first-act aria . The applause was as enthusiastic as usual , but I did not miss the puzzled expressions upon the faces of certain @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I resolved that the only way to carry off this emergency was to pretendp147that her singing had been flawless as usual . Firm in this resolution , I knocked upon the door and was surprised not to be immediately admitted . After several minutes ' waiting , I knocked again . Presently Dora opened the door a crack , peered through it , and with a genuinely terrified expression whispered to me that Madame would not permit me to enter . My alarm and consternation may be only too well imagined . I replied to the maid that this must be a matter for my own judgment and that I felt obliged to disregard the orders of her mistress . I grasped the edge of the door , firmly pushed the maid aside , and entered the room . My poor Lena was crouched in the far corner upon a footstool , garbed in such remnants of clothing as she had not flung all about the room . She had removed her wig , but not the ugly white bandage to which it had been pinned . This was stained with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her streaming eyes , there flowed a torrent of tears to mingle with the greases and pigments of her make-up into an unspeakable sight . She was weeping in great racking sobs that tore my heart and filled me with terror , for this , entirely aside from its emotional danger , could only harm her voice the more . She ignored me . She was rocking to and fro upon her stool , moaning and murmuring an unintelligible garble of language which I recognized as Italian and Czech , interspersed with " Oh my God , " which she gasped over and over again in English . " Ah Maestro ! " she would say , " carissitino mio , scusate , perdonate , Oh my God , Oh my God ! "  --  and then she would wander off into passionate phrases in her native tongue that I could not hope to reproduce here , rockingthis way and that upon her stool and at last burying her face in the greasy towel upon her knees . I knew not what to do . At last I placed my hand upon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her feet . Her weeping and sobbing ceased instantly . She clenched her fists until I saw her knuckles whiten , and knew too well that her nails were digging into her palms . " How did you get here ? " she hissed in a low , furious tone . " I told her to keep you out . Get out . Get out of here at once , do you understand ? " She advanced a step toward me , and even as my temper rose at the insults she was all too ready to fling at me , I could not deny a thrill of excitement at sight of her , for she was magnificent . Ridiculous as she looked , with her face smeared in streaks of red and blue and black , with her hair wildly dishevelledabove the bandage , with her underclothing falling from one shoulder and breast , with one foot bare and with the stocking she had drawn from it tangled in the towel in her hand , she was a glorious incarnation of mingled grief and anger . Her eyes seemed to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wide nostrils flared and trembled , her lips were pinched in her determination to suppress her sobs . " Get out , " she said again. " 1 can not , Lena , " I replied . " My place is here , to help you. , , " I need none of your help , " she said , struggling to keep her lips rigid . " Help ! My God , ca n't you see what you 've done ? This is your fault . You 've done this to me ! " " Let r.s not discuss that now , " I said , making a tremendouseffort not to let my temper rise , for there are times when no opera singer can fling challenges at a royal duke of France . " We 'll discuss whatever I choose ! " she retorted , " and since you have refused to leave me and avoid hearing what I hoped not to say , you shall hear it . You and your love ! I never want to see you again . I never want you to touch me. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mess of my life because of you . " " You have made no mess , " I answered , " and before acting upon your dismissal , I might add that you did not sing badly enough this evening to warrant this extraordinary outburst . You are merely overwrought . " " I am ? " she cried . " And pray , who are you to tell me whether I am overwrought , and how I sang ? Do you think you know anything about it ? You do not . You have no idea what my life is . You know nothing about me . You are a man , an animal , selfish , you only want one thing like all the rest of them . Ah , I could kill you ! " She turned to the wall and buried her face in her arms . My anger had by then risen to a point where I was making the greatest effort not to walk out of the room and out of her life , fee:ing that , like every vulgarian , she was only showing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yet , as I turned actually to go , I knew that I was wrong . Whether last night 's abandonment had been more my fault than hers was irrelevant . I loved this woman , and I knew that she was both a peasant and an artist . If this was the first time she had displayed the lower qualities of both , I could appreciate that she had never done so before . I removed my cloak and laid it , with my opera hat , upon the divan , seating myself quietly there in a firm determination to ride out the storm . Silence prevailed for some time ; she must have thought I had taken my departure . Presently she turned toward her dressingtable and began wearily to remove her make-up . Then she saw me in the mirror . She whirled around . " Louis ! " she exclaimed , " did I not ask you to go ? Ca n't you understand that I must be alone ? The longer you stay here the harder it is for me. "  | " It is not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I want only to try to make you believe that your grief is exaggerated . Nobody had an idea you sang as you think you did . " She laid down her comb and looked at me a moment . Then she began to speak , quickly and with passion but I could see with a tremendous effort to control her temper . " The point is not what anybody thought , " she said . " The point is what I know . I know I ca n't mix these two things , this  --  this love  --  and my work . I knew it years ago , that 's why I lived the life I did before I knew you . I love you , Louis , that is the trouble . I am only human . I have learned to enjoy love and you see what I paid for it tonight . " She poured some sherry from the bottle on her dressing table and drank it off . " Other women may be able to combine love and their art , if they have one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've talked of this before . In holiday time , perhaps , I could make love and not suffer from it . But not when I 'm working . " " This is the first time you have thought you suffered , " I pointed out . " This is the first time I have really sung badly , " she correctedme . " But when I practise on a clay after you have stayed with me , do you think I do n't feel the difference , the let-down , the lack of resilience ? Of course I do , and I have been worrying about it . Louis , "  --  she leaned toward me and stared at me a moment , biting her lips . " Do you know where I think the voice comes from ? " I knew , indeed , and nodded . " Exactly . I once heard a teacher give a girl a terrible scolding for having a love affair , and I 'll never forget what he said to her . " " Yes ? " " It is not pretty @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said it couldp151not come out in two places at once . It came out either in bed or on the stage , and she could take her choice . " " But how can this be true ? " I inquired , interested and puzzled . " If it were , no good singer could have love in her life , and yet most of them do . " " It is the greatest of mysteries to me , " she said . " I have thought about it . I believe I understand a little . I think it is a question of balance . Up to a certain point , love richens the voice , but after that it depletes it . Yet there must be some love somewhere , at least in the beginning . No virgin would sing as I do . " I asked if she had ever speculated as to the effect of childbearingon a woman 's voice . The discussion had grown increasinglyimpersonal and I felt it good for her to talk calmly with me upon this subject and perhaps regain some confidencethrough thorough @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's thought . " It does not hurt a good voice , " she replied , " and in some cases it might be said to improve it . Certainly there are many instances where having a child has seemed to strengthen and solidify the timbre and enlarge the size of the voice . " She was completing her toilette as she talked . " I know , " she continued , " that in my own case my voice changed utterly after I  --  " She turned suddenly deathly pale , and clapped her hands over her mouth . She had not missed my start of amazement at her slip . She sat rigid before her ' table , gazing at me in the mirror with eyes distended in panic . I rose and went close to her , taking her two hands in mine . " Is that it ? " I asked her softly . " You have had a child , and miserably ? " She nodded , too stricken to speak . I gathered her into my arms , kneeling beside her chair . " My @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | I understood now so much that formerly had seemed mysterious . I saw at a glance whole segments of her past that had bewildered or eluded me ; I could look back upon her rigid austerity in Paris with complete understanding . I do not know whether she feared that this revelation of her past would repel me and cause me to seek my freedom from our . liaison . I tend more to believe that it was purely a question of pride whose abandonment frightened and weakened her . But she clung to me , wordless , conveying with infinite poignancy her appreciation of my sympathy . All was as if the past hour had never been . We both felt strengthened and our love renewed by a wonderful increase of understanding . Yet , in the carriage on the way to her flat she took my hand , and beneath the street lamp I saw an earnest and seriousexpression in her eyes . " You understand now , dear Louis , " she said softly . " Let us study how to have our love , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and patience . You have so much of both . " I smiled at her , melting with inward tenderness at the clear , gentle expression of her face . But she spoke further , with some hesitation . " I shall try to be yours and live for my art too , " she said ; and then , almost in a whisper , " but I must be fair with you , If I can not do both , you know what my choice will have to be ? " I bowed my head over her hands and kissed them pas , sionately . I knew , only too well , and with a painful premonition of certainty . I would treasure the more dearly this happiness while it was mine.  |p153LENA  'S problem was one to which I applied myself with willingness and great interest , for there was no doubt in my mind that , rich and rewarding as I had found her to be , she could not excite and hold me as she did without the inspirationof her fabulous voice . I understood also , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her psychologicaldependence upon the art in which she had made herselfsupreme . Without it , even with a remote diminution of her prowess , she lost confidence , stature , the vitality that set her apart from all other female creatures of my experience . We discussed all aspects of this question on the tender terms of intimacy that gradually flowered between us . It became clear that for a certain period both before and after singing , if she were to have fullest access to all her splendid physical resources , she must be quiet , inwardly and outwardly , and particularly emotionally ; that is to say , she must remain continent . Sometimes I passed a few quiet hours with her on the day of a performance , but more usually I left her entirely alone . For some thirty-six hours prior to her singing I made it a point never to display to her the faintest suggestion of ardor , for if I did she was only too eager to respond . Then , after a performance , she would quickly change to the nunlike robes in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and we would partake of our quiet supper , immediately after which she would retire , alone . Love made her warmer and gayer , more inclined to relax the strict routine she had long since prescribed for her own good . Quick to see all its wisdom , and fearful whenever she seemed , on some gay impulse , about to break it , I made myselfa stern warder for her protection . At such times she favored me with a bantering petit-nom that I did not greatly relish ; she called me " nton gendarme . " Since she sang customarilyan average of two performances a week , I was thus teasingly appreciated more than half the time . There remainedonly two or three days when she could live as she chose , and needless to say , it was never easy to adjust the fervor of our impulses and sentiments to such strictly defined requirements . There were times when the exaction took its toll in small fits of nerves and tiny flights of temper , when I learned that the difference between a celibate life and an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She never actually lost sight of her chosen ideal that her voice and her art must rule her existence , but now she was capable of resenting the disciplinary truth that they did . It was in the grip of this resentment that she showed , for the first time , minute sparks of a temper that I had not previously believed she possessed ; where love had expanded her nature it had also sharpened her sensitivity , and at times when she was childish and least in control of her strong will , she could petulantly exclaim that her existence was too difficult , that her career exacted too much and prevented her from enjoyinglife as other women did who had no talent at all . I seldomreplied in protest to these moods , knowing well how passing and trivial they were . For some weeks after the evening of her poor performance Lena was subdued and preoccupied of mood . I understood that she was living through a period of worry , fearful that her single failure to meet her own standard might be repeated for some less @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long hours walking briskly in the Prater when I knew it would better have pleased her to be driven there by me . She seemed restless and troubled . Her performances at the Hofoper remained fully , if not more than ever , her very best and her public worshipped her .. Nevertheless I was interested , one day when she had invited Herr Mahler to lunch with us at the Meissl and Schadn , a place she dearly loved , to hear him question her as to her visible malaise . She replied to him that she knew not herself the reason for her nerves , except perhaps that she had never recovered from the shock of the poor Donna Anna she had sung . " But this is nonsense , my child , everyone has poor days the wonder is that you never seemed to have one before . You are not troubled for fear of my displeasure ? " " I would be if you were to show it , " she answered . " But I think my real feeling is that I should be working harder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gustav Mahler studied her for a moment , then leaned back in his chair , " What you need , Geyer , " he said , " is a new part . You need something to put your shoulder to . How would you like to do Fidelio ? " Lena 's face lighted with a radiance that caused me to feel , I must confess , a twinge of envy ; few of my suggestions for her pleasure had ever evoked such delight . She grasped Herr Mahler 's hand across the table . " Ah ! " she exclaimed . " May I really do it , at last ? " " Why not ? I 've wanted you to learn it ever since you came here . Get it ready and we 'll have some performances for them to talk about ! " Lena had barely patience to finish her coffee , so eager was she to hasten home and start to work . She begged me to dispatch a telegram immediately to Frau Lehmann , whichP156she scribbled on a leaf of my pocketbook . It read : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , When I returned from the office where I had dispatched the message she was ready to go home , impatiently drawing on her gloves and smiling at the conductor , who was peacefully finishing his coffee and a large cigar . " Do not kill yourself , by the way , " he growled at her . " Please remember you are to sing your best for me in the Mozart this month . " She grasped his hand impulsively , saying , " Work could not kill me , Herr Direktor , please give me lots of it . " She waited only for the permission which was promptly telegraphed to her by Lilli Lehmann ( she assured me she would not have dared approach the role without her teacher 's blessing ) and then set seriously to work . This was my first opportunity to watch her learning an entire role , and in fascinatedattention I established myself in a corner of her salon , where she was barely aware of my presence . Every day her routine was exactly the same , unless she had a performancein @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but sat for hours at the piano slowly playing the score . On normal working days she would begin immediately after her morning walk  --  and now these were walks indeed , not drives in the Prater  --  slowly intoning about a page of the score at a time . She reduced the tempo fully by half , and used no expression whatever . She devoted herself solely to the structure of the music , telling me once that she attempted to learn as if her voice were an inanimate instrument , to be rigidly disciplined to the exactions of the composition . As she worked in this way , she accompanied herself roughly on the piano . At any complicated turn or difficult interval she would stop , sing it by itself extremely slowly , note by note , and repeat it precisely ten , fifteen , or twentyP157times . Next she would gradually increase the tempo until it matched the still retarded time in which she was studying the score . Lastly she would sing through the whole passage , including the particular block she had mastered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ much as to make them unrecognizable , and often she went from one fragment to another without any apparent logic , skipping from scene to scene or from the last act to the first . When I asked her the reason for this , she explained that she managed in this way to divest the music of its emotional sequence , and to force herself to regard it strictly for its technical exactions . She said she would not approach the emotional projection of the character until she had so mastered the score that she had an unshakable groundwork of correct music upon which to build her impersonation . " And then I will go to Frau Lilli anyway , " she added . " You did not think I would dare sing this without working with her first ? " I implied that I should not have thought that any coaching or instruction could be better than that of Mahler himself . She assured me I was quite right , but that while Mahler could feel Beethoven and feel his own conceptions , neither he nor anyone else could feel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a private conviction that my dear one was fully as capable as any woman alive of working out her own interpretation of the great character , but I honored her none the less for her humility and the simple eager passion of the student with which she applied herself to this consecrated work . During these weeks of study she refused to be entertained in any of the pleasant ways to which we had grown accustomed , abjuring her luncheons at Meissl and Schadn , and the little suppers at Schoner 's or Sacher 's , in which she usually took such pleasure . Instead I was sur- prised , one evening , to find her sitting up in bed with the score of Fidelio open on her knees , and a chunk of dry black bread in her hand , which she was gnawing as she read . " My darling ! " I exclaimed , " what , pray , are you doing , and where did you obtain that formidable piece of bread ? " She looked up at me and laughed . Her face was innocent of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was tied about her head with a narrow pink ribbon . She looked sixteen . " I am reverting to my childhood , " she explained . " This is the real way to work , and this is my supper tonight . I made Mitzi give it to me from the servants ' table . I grew up on this . " Nor would she touch a morsel of the delicious Tournedos or a drop of the Chateau Margaux that were served to me . She was studying the spoken text and I spent the whole evening lying back in an armchair beside her bed , while she recited the beautiful recitatives in the rich low voice to which I could gladly have listened forever . She was learning not only her own lines , but the whole opera . She did this habitually in all works in which she appeared , but not with the definite intention she applied to Fidelio . She had ever a phenomenal memory , such that T never knew her once to have recourse to the soufelcr , and indeed her colleagues frequentlyassured me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confident of a faultlessly smooth performance because , as they put it , she was a walking score in their midst . After learning the recitatives of the whole opera , she began to sing her part slowly , from beginning to end , with minute attention to every shade and particle of the composer'sdirections . Now she worked up from the rigid basis of notes she had so carefully mastered , through every separate detail ; phrasing , breathing , accents , pauses , the exact shadesp159of color demanded by the fortes , pianos , and all other directions . One day when she paused to rest after an hour 's work I asked her if she had not really known the music of Leonore very well before she ever inaugurated this rigorous course of study . " Well , of course I did , mon Cher , " she answered . " How could I not know it ? I have heard Frau Lilli sing it , and other women , and you could hardly spend nine years around opera houses without having heard Fidelio . " Then why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she had never heard the opera before ? " That is just the way to study , " she explained . " To clear one 's mind of every previous idea and impression , to start absolutely from a bare slate , and to write on it only and exactly what the composer wrote . If I relied merely on my familiarity with the music , I might turn out any odd person 's misconception of Fidelio , instead of Beethoven 's wishes about it . I can not know what those wishes are unless I work with this intense attention to the score . " At last she decided , after about four weeks of study , that she was ready to go to Berlin and work on the impersonation , the acting , and the emotional creation of Leonore with Lilli Lehmann . Mahler pretended to be annoyed when she asked for a three weeks ' leave of absence from the Hofoper , right in the middle of the season . But secretly he was vastly pleased . No other prima donna of Lena Geyer 's standing studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none was so amenable to valid instruction , none so rewarding when the work was done . He thought , I believe , that she was slightly exaggerating her intensity of study by going to Berlin to work with Lehmann when he would only too gladly have worked with her at home , but she refused to sing the part unless she were given time to study with herP160own teacher . Therefore she prepared to leave , and I , as a matter of course , told Pierre to prepare my things for the journey . But she placed her hand upon my arm and begged me to request Pierre to leave us for the moment . When he had gone she explained apologetically that on this occasion she felt it would be better if I allowed her to go alone . She wished to revert , she said , as completely as possible , to the austerity , the solitude , and the celibacy of her student days , in which period she had learned her greatest parts . If I were to accompany her the whole spirit of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be changed from what she hoped to make it . At first I was loath to concede this point , and expressed my wish to accompany her just that she might not be subjected to long hours of solitude . " Those hours , " she said , " may not be pleasant , but they will be the making of this part . I must have them , my dear . " Accordingly I placed her upon a train to Berlin , not withoutgrave misgivings over her going there , but she assured me that the Emperor 's ridiculous edict of expulsion was by now a dead letter and that , in any case , nobody would dare molest her or question her so long as she was a guest of Lilli Lehmann at Grunewald . It was as I embraced her just before descending from the train , and bade her a reluctant farewell , that I realized how long it had been , though in apparently casual circumstances , since I had had my darling to call all my own ; since I had possessed her . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of Fidelio . I journeyed to Paris in the interval that my dear Lena was in Berlin , and rejoined her upon the Vienna Express after her three weeks of study were finished . She looked radiant , reposeful , and calm , with a fresh , virginal expression upon her face . She said she had not had nearly enough time withp161Frau Lehmann , but that both felt , with the intensive work behind her , that she was ready for her rehearsals with Herr Mahler . She was so absorbed in her part and in the plans she had heard from Mahler for an unparalleled production , that she seemed hardly to realize that we were together again . That night when I took her in my arms , she was at once responsive , yet helplessly reluctant , and I sensed immediately that my love and my wishes were an intrusion that she was too loyal and affectionate to confess . I asked her if she wished the assurance that I would hold my desire for her in abeyance until she had completed her rehearsals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for a moment with an expression of the most exquisite tenderness , then with tears in her eyes drew my head to her breast and murmured , " You do , you do understand everything . Dear Louis , I do not deserve such generosity . " Mahler had not heard a note of her work while she was studying in Vienna , and as soon as she returned from Berlin he called the first rehearsal in one of the upper rooms at the Hofoper . Lena permitted me to accompany her there , and it may be imagined with what eagerness I awaited the result of her labor . Only the principals of the cast , Mahler , the correpetiteur , and myself were in the room . I was seated in a far corner , as much out of the way as possible . I thought it fabulously gracious of Mahler to permit my presence , knowing well that he was breaking one of his strictest rules out of his peculiar regard for Lena Geyer . The rehearsal began , and I had only to listen to the beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jacquino to realize that this would be , indeed , a cast with which Mahler himself could find no fault . Then followed the brief recitativesin the entrances of Rocco and Fidelio , and Mahler signalledfor the quartette , Mir ist so wunderbar . Naturallyp162it was unformed , there was much for him to criticise , correct , and improve ; but I , who had never heard this music before , was struck to the core of my being by its unearthly , incredible beauty . When I remarked this later to my darling she nodded but said " Wait . You have heard only the roughest suggestion of it . Wait until you hear it with the orchestra . " It had been planned to work on the whole first act that afternoon , but Mahler was so deliberate , so precise and painstakingof detail , and so exact in his directions to the singers , that the afternoon was spent before the great duet of Pizarro and Rocco was finished . The moment had come to adjourn , but even as he consulted his watch , Mahler looked up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a warm expression on his severe face . She smiled at him and then at me in my corner . She knew what to expect . " Are you too tired ? " the great conductor asked her , with his watch in his hand . " Could you do the Abscheulicherjustto give me the picture ? " " But certainly , " she exclaimed , nodding to the correpetiteur ; and drawing a little away , she allowed herself space in which to simulate her entrance , as he began the stirring recitative . I had heard , one may remember , every note of her preparation of this , from the unrecognizable first analysis to the last careful review before she left to join her teacher . Yet I was totally unprepared for the electrifying thrill , indeed the shock , of her glorious tone as she delivered the classic phrase , Abscheulicher , wo eilst Du hilt ! Her colleaguesabout the room drew back close to the walls with awestruck , expressive glances at one another . Mahler 's eyes narrowed , his head came forward on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she finished the last phrase of the recitative and paused as the pianist played the opening bars of the Hoffnungsaria , there was a faint sigh about theP163room . She stood poised with her eyes fixed on the far wall , Then she drew an imperceptible breath and began to singKomm Hoffnung , lass den letzten Stern , Den letzten Stern der Muden nicht erbleichen . She had proceeded no farther than that noble phrase when I felt the tears coursing unheeded down my cheeks and realized that never in all my treasured experience had I known her voice to speak so movingly . From the moment of my first experience of it , this piece of music remains for me the noblest height of song . I can not express the grandeur , the purity , the profundity with which she invested it ; above all , the boundless , encompassing warmth of that great and true woman , who sang it as no other human ever could or ever will . The majesty of its lines fitted her like a cloak , and the formidable difficulties of its intervals and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ singing . When she finished , the room remained long in silence ; at last there was a faint and fluttering " Ah ! " from the dumbfoundedsingers who had doubtless had the greatest lesson of their lives . Mahler sat motionless with his face supported in his two hands , as he had been listening . After a time he drew himself up , looked at her with no effort to conceal the emotion in his countenance , and stretched out one hand to her with a helpless gesture . She took his hand and pressed it . Then he stood up and motioned vaguely to the other members of the company . " Enough for today , " he growled , .. and stalked from the room . The rehearsals continued intensively for three weeks , though my dear Lena was required to sing much other music during that time . I remember how warmly I admired her wonderful powers of concentration as she would either lose herself in , or necessarily lay aside , her intense absorption .   64in Fidelio . She seemed unaware that life contained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She was ever tender and affectionate with me , but so abstracted that I hesitatedto intrude upon her preoccupation lest the interruption be a rude shock . She was extremely particular about the costumethat was being made , determined at once that it should blend unobtrusively with those of the men , yet naturally desirous that her figure appear to advantage . I assured her that in comparison with all the women I had ever observed , she alone had no cause for concern about her appearance in this male disguise ; her limbs were slender and shapely , her figure and carriage superbly erect . When the costume was finished she looked heroic in it . Musical initiates and devotees have written far more eloquentlythan I could concerning the Fidelio performances under Gustav Mahler at the Hofoper . They have gone down in operatic history as unexcelled and unparalleled ; his interpretationis thought to be the ideal , his training of the wonderfulVienna Orchestra prodigious , and the cast that sang under him , headed by my darling , has remained without peer . In a capital so passionately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what eagerness and excitement the premiere of this production was awaited , and long before the opening night no power on earth could have procured admissionto the sold-out house . I was never in the habit of accompanying my dear one to the opera house , as she preferred always to be alone with Dora before singing , but I usually stopped at her dressing room for a moment to kiss her hand before going to my seat . When I entered , ten minutes before the performance on that memorable night , she seemed so calm , so controlled , so perfectly at peace that I marvelled anew at this side of her character . Only about trifles did she ever show excitementP165in a superficial sense ; the graver the moment , the calmer her manner . Yet there were signals for one who knew her well , in the slight flutter of her nostrils as they dilated , in the enlargedand darkened pupils of her eyes , and in the chill of her hands , which she kept quietly clasped . How I admired her in the severe breeches @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her own brown hair dressed in a club in the eighteenth-century fashion ! She looked more truly regal , and more her most ideal self , than in all the crowns , robes , and jewels of her other roles . There was a wonderful glow beneath the pigments of her make-up , and she whispered to me as I bent over her , " Frau Lilli is here ! She arrived this morning . Is she not an angel ? " I admitted readily that the great woman had done her favorite pupil a signal honor , but could not deceive myself as to the envious twinge that caused me a moment 's pain . Everything seemed to be conspiring to draw my beloved farther from me , into the one realm of inspiration from which I must , in a large measure , be excluded . However , this was her greatest night , and I sternly forbade myself even a passing expression that might mar her triumph and her delight . I made my way to my box convinced all anew of the greatness and supremacy of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mahler had no sooner raised his baton and whipped out the first four breath-taking measures of the overture than we thousands in the audience knew , as one mind , that we were present at the making of history . Four measures for full orchestra are a minute fragment of music , yet it is possible for them to set a keynote of performance that one will never forget . So it was that night and , too , at all his subsequentrenderings of this incomparable score . I have been told that he produced the same effect when , on March the 66 twentieth , 1908 , just two years after this historical Vienna evening , he conducted Fidelio at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York , with Lena Geyer proudly upholding the standard the two had created in Vienna . The performance proceeded upon the highest plane it has ever been my experience to witness . Perfection could not have been more minutely achieved . And , withal , the fire and soaring inspiration were untrammelled , the sense that this monumental thing was rising like flame in our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have I heard music so perfectly sung as the quartette , which , like the heartrending Prisoners ' Chorus , was hushed , tense , breathless , and subtle beyond all words . The cast was so fine that each member added immeasurably to the glorious total ; and for once in my experience I was content to listen as the other artists bore out the development , rather than chafe with impatience for the appearance of my darling . From the moment of her silent entrance , and of her subdued participation in the quartette , the audience settled into worshipful tension , and when in the first-act trio she declared her bravery and high devotionin the noble phrase , Ich habe Mut , mit kaltem Blut Will ich hinab mich wagen , her auditors swayed toward her in a very rush of exaltation . Surely she had never sung so divinely before , and surely she can have sung no better since . She herself was proud to call that work the highest achievement of her career . Throughout the performance , she gave , gave of herself and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tones like peals of a celestial organ came from her glorious throat . Each note in her register seemed more incredibly beautiful than the last ; and when she soared 67into the B at the climax of the Hoff nungsaria , and poured , rather than held it at the height of the formidable scale , I thought I must cease to live , so overwhelmed was I with emotion . Yet even more was to be borne ( for it was , in a sense , a matter for endurance ; it was too blindingly beautiful ) when she reached the great climax of the second act , and held the snarling Pizarro at bay with her pistol while she cried Tot erst sein Weib ! I have never witnessed such blood-curdling drama upon the stage , heightened to the last degree of tension by the stirring measures of the trumpet for which singers and orchestra held their moment of telling silence . And then came the duet , the passion of reunion , renewed life , hope , and ecstasy with Florestan . I pray I may be pardoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the utter conviction with which she clothed her measures of joy and love . No woman could have created this who knew not whereof she sang ; and Lena Geyer did know , for which our all-too-short years of bliss were not in vain . But how , how can I hope to convey the soaring joy in her voice as she sang 0 namenlose Freude ! , the authentic and overwhelmingpassion in her words , mein Mann an meiner Brust ! How subtle and tender was her transformation from the resolute , tragic Fidelio with her dangerous secret , to the released , rewarded , and meltingly feminine Leonore , restored to her beloved 's arms ! Quite surely a comparable triumph for all concerned has never been duplicated at the Hofoper . The audience remainedstanding and cheering , stamping , beating its hands together , shouting itself hoarse , as the cast , with Gustav Mahler in its midst , took an interminable succession of curtains . The ovation would have continued indefinitely , had it not been curtailed by a not unexpected order for Lena GeyerP168to repair to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that ruler who was , after all , her sovereign , though she seemed never to realize it , the highest decoration it was possible to bestow upon an artist , with the title of **26;3758;TOOLONG . From my own box I was able to see quite clearly the noble grace with which she acknowledged the honor , and the perfect curtsey which , even in the boots and breeches of her male costume , she invested with ineffable charm . After the Emperor withdrew there was more cheering , shouting , throwing of flowers , and bestowing of wreaths ; and finally , at a very late hour , I was able to make my way through the excited public crowding the corridors to the stage passageway . I had expected to find my dear one alone , and was looking toward the infinitely sweet reward of taking her at last in my arms . But I found I had been preceded to her sanctum . As I opened the door I saw a handsome , black-clad woman seated upon the divan ; and before her , kneeling on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ visitor 's lap , my beloved  --  in tears ! She raised a flushed and streaming face to me as I entered . " Here , " she gasped , between sobs , " this is Louis , Frau Lilli . " The splendid-looking woman raised her small , severely coiffed head and gazed at me for a moment with an expression of frank inquiry . She was , in a word , subjecting me to critical scrutiny , and in the light of subsequent events I fear she found me at fault . At the moment , however , she bowed politely and extended her right hand . The circumstances were hardly such as to permit of formal amenities . Lena , with her arms around the waist of Lilli Lehmann , was sobbinglike an exhausted child , and giving way to a rush of emotion that completely astounded me . I had never thought she would so abandon her habitual control . I also thoughtp169I knew her better than anyone in the world , and was amazed at her abandonment in the presence of another person . Frau Lehmann took @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her habit to take the helm of any development in her life , and spoke to me as if I were a stranger , though she knew , of course , everything of my identity . " She is overwrought , " she said , putting her hand on Lena 's hair , " and I think she should be put to bed as quickly as possible . Can she leave here just as she is ? " My carriage was waiting outside , and with it , I knew , a tremendous crowd of Lena Geyer 's worshippers , whose customit was to await her exit from the stage door , to greet her there with clamorous cheers , and to receive roses from her bouquets , which she pulled apart and threw to them . I knew that she could not stand this demonstrative ordeal in her present condition , wherefore I told Frau Lehmann that it would be better if we could slip out from a door on the other side of the building , where I would have the carriage ready . " Very well , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in one carriage , and Lena must be quiet . I shall go with with her in one carriage and you two "  --  motioning to Dora  --  " can bring the flowers in another . " May God reward me for the iron control with which I smothered the rage that engulfed me ! I had not yet so much as touched my Lena 's hand , and here was this woman , plantingherself like an oak between us , and calmly disposing of me along with the servant and the flowers ! Lena must have known of the instant wrath that blazed within me , but she was too exhausted  --  even had she not been too attached to Lilli Lehmann  --  to protest . I bowed  --  very coldly , I remember  --  andwent to make the arrangements and direct the carriageto the small side door from which they were to escape . P170We wrapped Lena in several cloaks , put a warm shawl over her head , and quickly led her under the stage and out the passageway on the other side to the carriage . Meanwhile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hired fiacre at the stage door , and I joined her after my dear one , in the custody of her duenna , had rolled away . How black with rage I was ! Yet , as I boiled with resentment all the way to her flat , I was constrained to concede the striking and vital personality of Lena 's great teacher . Why was it not natural that she should take command at this time and in the opera house ?  --  and why , I was forced to admit too , was it not natural for Lena to wish to be with her on this evening ? Deeply as I had immersed myself in the web of my darling 's career , and glad as I was to have done so , I felt for the first time that my choice was not entirely one of delights , and that I could not hope to possess her always , free of conflicts rooted in this matter of her allegiance to her art . Still exalted by the inspiration of her music , but with foreboding in my heart @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her dwelling  |p171As  I look back upon the years of my happiness , I am constrained to marvel that so few distressful elements ever threatened the harmony with which my dear one and I were blessed . As a man of wisdom and experience I have not failed to remark the vast difference between the relationship of marriage , based on fact , dynasty , property , and regard , and of such a union as ours , the flowering of the greatest of human emotions . But a flower , as contrasted with the sturdy oak , must early wither and die , and must in its very delicacy be subject to a thousand adverse winds and blighting droughts . Though the exercise of reason has ever appeared to me the highest function of the cultivated man , and though reason dictated to me the awareness that our lovely bloom must some day fade away , I hoped neverthelessto keep it alive and fragrant for many long years , by the exercise of my fervent devotion . After the premiere of her historic Fidelio , in February , ' gob , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of happy passion and endearing calm . But when I took her once again to my arms , after more than ten weeks of deprivation in the cause of her great work , I becameinstantly , though reluctantly aware of a change in her response to me . There would have seemed , to the average man , no less warmth , tenderness , alacrity , and earnestness in this fabulously rewarding woman ; but to me , attuned to the faintest echo of her every mood , an abstraction , an in- finitesimal preoccupation drifted across our ecstasy to mat its accustomed perfection . This , of all things , was the one of which one could not speak and could not question ; clearly it was indicated that I should redouble my efforts for her happiness and confidence . I applied myself with all my heart to doing so ; and such was the status of affairs when we made our annual journey to Paris for her season at theopera . Here at last we could be children in my own lovely world , and once removed from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and from the super-challengealways represented by him and the works he chose for her to sing , Lena became much more her old self . Ah , what heavenly days we enjoyed in those two precious months , the most beguiling , endearing of all gifts of the good God to mortals  --  April and May in my beloved Paris ! Now I heard no stern intentions as to dry black bread and the stimulation of solitude . Now I was not forced to stride , secretly protesting , beside her as she took her rigorous daily exercise in the park . Now my horses were brought back to town from their long exile at Chartres , and my carriages polished to a mirror gleam by the rejoicing Rouart and his assistants . Now my noble Charet presided once again over the kitchen of my dear one 's flat in the Rue Monsieur , and my worthy Jules poured for us the rarest treasures of my forefathers ' cellars , riches too precious ever to be dispatched to us in Austria . Now our most famous restaurateurs welcomed us once more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the coveted prize of our favor , while the greatest artists of the Parisian couture addressed themselves to the happy challengeof weaning Madame away from her predilection for the Viennese modistes . I celebrated the fourth anniversary of our meeting in her dressing room by bestowing upon her  --   |p173when  , as chance would have it she again sang Elsa in Lohengrin  --  a tiara of perfectly matched pearls of royal size , which Cartier at my direction had been assembling for many months past . I shall never forget her queenly beauty when she wore this , together with a pearl-embroidered white gown by Callot , every line of which remains graven upon my memory . I thought myself again the most fortunate of men , and that the winter of my discontent , which had nevertheless been the greatest of her career , had been dispensed us by Providenceonly to make our delight the sweeter now . In June we travelled to London for three weeks at Covent Garden , and at the beginning of July we retired to a beautiful house that I had rented high upon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two months , enjoying the blue tropical Mediterranean , the golden sun , the wealth of fragrance and color , and the seclusion afforded by the unfashionable season of the year . We were waited upon by my own staff from the Chateau , and a beautifully leisured , tender , and relaxing life we led . After some two weeks , however , my Lena one morning drew me down beside her as she reclined upon the terrace in a bouffant peignoir with her coffee and her mail upon the table nearby . She informed me that she had received a letter from Frau Lilli Lehmann in Salzburg requesting her to come there for the month of August , and appear in the Mozart festival that was of all things nearest to Frau Lehmann 's heart . " Of course you will not go , " I said comfortably . " Fran Lilli knows how hard you have worked recently and how important it is for you to have your rest . This was a gracious gesture , merely . " After a moment 's silence my Lena looked at me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " I must go , Louis . I wish to . " I could not trust my ears . Could it be in any way possible that my clear one , my beloved upon whom I had fixed all my hopes of happiness , perhaps with the very intensity that forebodedmy fear of losing her , would go forward to meet this destructive intrusion , rather than do her utmost , as I would , to keep it at bay ? It is not my nature to protest in words any situation that can better be dealt with by silence or by action ; yet in this case I felt that neither of these resources could be adequate to express my concern . I must speak . Drawing upon the philosophy with which it has been my aim to arm myself in all crises of life , I began to point out to her the mistakes she would make if she were to insist upon jeopardizing her strength in doing this extra work , interrupting the idyll to which we had both looked forward as the re-creation of our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this bit of idealism where hard work and much honor would not compensate for the absence of a financial reward . To all she listened in silence . At length she looked up and began to speak . " I have feared for a long time that this would come , " she said slowly . " If you c10 not understand why I must go , I can not explain to you . Do you realize that Frau Lilli might well have asked Inc at any time in the past four years , yet that she has refrained ? Do you know why ? " " No , my darling ! " " Because she is a very wise and patient woman . She has known me well for years . She loves me , as I love her . She would never have wished to cut me off from any fullness of life or richness of expression , so long as I continued to sing well . When she knew that I was happy with you , and yet didp175full justice to her ideals , she would not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while she was doing this noble work in Salzburg . " " Then why has she intruded now ? " " Because she knows perhaps better than I what my life and my work must be . She knows that a few years of carefreeholiday are all very well  --  but that we are destined for greater and sterner things . We  --  I mean myself , and her , people like us . Louis "  --  she leaned forward and pressed my hand impulsively  --  " I do n't want to leave here and spoil your summer . I am happy to stay . But I can not , do n't you understand ?  --  I must go . " " Are you under such an obligation to Lilli Lehmann ? " " Only in so far as the obligation is to myself . Oh , my dear , let us not go into the whole question . You have known from the very first that everything could not be ideal . Do you remember the night of the awful Donna Anna , when I reservedthe right to make these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all truthfulness , I wanted to admit that I understoodnow . Yet I could not . All my instincts rose to fight for this woman I worshipped , to keep her beside me , and to prevent the intrusion of her other world which must mean the destruction of ours . I felt a surge of resistance in my heart , and I said " Lena , I do not wish you to go . " She gazed at me in vast surprise . She puckered her brows and bent her head slightly as if she had not heard aright . " You do not wish me to ? " she repeated slowly . " But I have already said that I must . I am going . I must sing at Salzburg , it is my duty . " Alas for our little minds and little memories ! Though I had won her with my passionate assurances that no duty or obligation must ever tinge her motives in yielding to me ,   76nevertheless I heard myself say : " Your duty to your ambition , perhaps . Have you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ slowly to her face in an incomprehensiblegesture . I thought it was grief , that she was about to weep . But in a moment she turned to me and I saw a flame of deep anger lighting her vibrant green eyes , causing her passionate nostrils to tremble , her lips to set rigidly , and her throat to pulsate visibly before my eyes . She was very pale . " So long as you make the effort to understand me , " she said hoarsely , " I have some duty , some debt of honor to you . The moment you call my work intrusion , my ideals mere ambition , you release me from any duty I might feel toward you . I feel nothing now , Louis . Please go and leave me alone . I shall start for Salzburg tomorrow . Please have Pierre tell Dora to begin packing . " " You shall not go ! " I thundered , leaping from my chair . All my reticence , all my poise and reason , were consumed in a blazing passion . I stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You shall not go , " I repeated . " I have not stood in the background of your life for months  --  for this . I have not given up my life , my friends , my mother 's serenity , my family 's hopes , all my freedom , my home  --  for this ! What am I ?  --  a lackey , to be conveniently on hand when useful , and dismissed when in the way ? " To this outburst she made no answer . She merely stared at me and then arose from her chair and began to walk toward the house . " I think you are beside yourself , " she said . I spent a most hideous day , struggling with the vestiges of my anger , mortified by my own disgraceful outburst . Lena remained in her rooms , knowing quite well that I would not seek admittance . In the hallways I observed her maid Dora moving to and fro , packing her effects preparatory to 77the journey . I knew that Pierre had gone to the railway office to arrange @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ servants were all below at their tea , and that she was alone , I climbed the exterior stairs to her balcony and found her lying upon a wicker divan , with her face toward the sea . I drew a chair beside her and said , " Lena , I should like to go to Salzburg with you . " She considered my words for some time . I watched her face , slowly growing softer , her eyes melting in gathering tears . Presently two of them welled over and slipped down her cheeks . She extended one hand to me , which I seized and kissed passionately . But she said , " Louis , I must go alone . I should have thought so before this morning ; but now I am sure . I do n't know what will come of this . I ca n't tell what I think . Last winter when you were so understanding during the Fidelio I thought nothing could ever separate us . Now I do n't know . We had better consider this journey a trial of our union @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you and everythingwill be as it always was . If not  --  we must find out . " So she left ; and I remained alone in the house on the cliffs while she was absent in Salzburg . I had ample time , indeed far too much , for retrospection , yearning , and ominous thoughts . I was forced to realize that while no other midsummerengagement could have torn her from my side , my dear Lena had not hesitated to answer the summons of her great teacher  --  nay , to go to Salzburg to sing I knew not how many difficult performances entirely without remuneration . True , the Archduke Eugen had lent Lilli Lehmann 's SalzburgFestival the lustre of his patronage , the support of his resources , and the services of the Vienna Philharmonic Orchestra  --  butLena Geyer was never an artist who sang for the favor of royalty . I knew she had gone solely at the behest of her artistic conscience and the loftiest instincts of her ambition  --  which was exactly what made my deprivation so difficult to bear . No mitigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notes that my dear one wrote me , full of amusing anecdotes about the Festival . In those days it bore no resemblance to the augmented and internationallypopular celebration later promulgated by Max Reinhardtand his associates . It was entirely and authentically Mozart , the operas sung in the charming old baroque StadtTheater , and every note and detail under the personal supervision of Lilli Lehmann . She sang in all performances , ever prepared at a moment 's notice to step into any part , even if it lay beyond her range . Once upon running into difficulties with the casting of Die Zauberflote , she notified a recalcitrant tenor who was rehearsing Tamino  --  " Take care that I do not dismiss you and sing this part myself ! " Lena added that she could well have done so . It was impossible to resent the influence of such a great personality over my dear one , but wherein it threatened to come between us I was keenly on my guard . I could never believe that my union with the only woman I ever truly loved would terminate ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself to regard matters in their true light , from the viewpoint of a man of the world . When she returned from Salzburg , and stepped from the train at Nice to my waiting arms , I scanned her dear face for any signs of possiblechange . There were none , I thought ; and yet I knew too surely that my joy at our reunion was not matched by an equal emotion in her . She was tender , her great eyes glowed with warmth and affection , she was eager to relax at home with me , to revel in the seclusion , the luxury , and the gay small intimacies that flavored so much of our happy life together . But the fire that had nourished us so long was burning out . P179When we returned in October to Vienna she informed me that she had decided to sing the Siegfried and the **28;3786;TOOLONG , upon which she had worked with Frau Lehmann in the early mornings at Salzburg , before they undertook the occupations of the day . " Had you no rest at all ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I needed , my dear , " she replied , " I have had enough rest in the past five summers to last me for the five to come . " This was tantamount to an announcement that henceforwardshe was planning to spend her summers at Salzburgwith Lilli Lehmann instead of in France with me , and when I showed by my appalled silence that I felt the blow , she stooped suddenly , took my head in her arms , and kissed me passionately , gazing as she did so into my eyes . " Ah , dear Louis ! " she sighed . Only too clearly I sensed the struggle that was taking place in her mind and heart ; but this was no time to bring matters to a head , and I resigned myself to waiting , and to trusting that my devotion would eventually outweigh the strong forces that were drawing her away from me . I would not have believed it possible for her glorious voice actually to improve in quality , yet at her first performanceof that season under Mahler , when we had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so . She sang Sieglinde , that part above all others in which the ineffable femininein her rich nature came most to the fore . Though she had prepared the two ensuing Brunnhildes , she had refused to consider that of Die Walkiire , clinging as long as she might to the wonderfully human tragedy of Sieglinde . Matters came far more suddenly to a head than could have seemed possible . All at once we had upon our hands a series of crises , and I can not forget those early winterp180days of 1907 , when the sun threatened never again to appear , when my beloved Lena was protestingly confined to her bed with one of the few colds I ever knew her to suffer , when problems beset us at every hand , and when disaster to everything I valued became increasingly imminent . By far the most distressing , to her , of all the misfortunes  --  indeed , what seemed an unmitigated catastrophe  --  was the impasse which loomed between Mahler and the directorate of the Ilofoper , developing out of a personal grievance held against him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ well known , Mahler 's combination of irascibility and uncompromisingstandards had ever made him an extremely difficultman to work with . Those singers who preferred the tinselled laurels of superficial applause and individual acclaimto the serious satisfaction of great musical accomplishmentwere rebellious and mutinous toward his wishes . Though he was nominally the General Artistic Director of the Hofoper , the cabals that operated against him were close to Royalty and to the intriguing powers who could , as Maher could not , command the last word in administrative matters at the Opera . When these powers demanded from Mahler an apology to the tenor who had precipitated the crisis , the great man flung his directorship in their faces and quit the Hofoper forever . It can scarcely be imagined with what towering fury my Lena received the news of this disgraceful scandal . She paced her salon with long , nervous strides , her hands clenched , her lips compressed , her hair dishevelled , and her eyes , I could almost swear , shooting sparks of rage . Only once before , when she believed herself to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unbridled temper ; but now the burden of her indignation on behalf of a beloved preceptormade her awesome . She opened her mouth from time 1to time , and I , sitting nearby and conjuring my wits for ways to pacify her , waited palpitatingly for her words . They did not come . Helplessly she strove for expression of her outrage , her disgust , and of her loyalty to the great director . Futilely I pleaded with her to lie down once more upon her divan , where she was convalescing from the cold that had kept her off the stage for more than a week . " What difference does it make now ? " she cried . " You do n't think I would set foot on that stage again , do you ? " " But I do , " I answered . " After all , you are bound by contract . You must sing . " At that she whirled round and gazed at me with the wideeyedexcitement of sudden discovery . " But I 'll cancel the contract ! " she exclaimed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She might as well have struck me a fierce blow across the face , for even as she pronounced these rash words I knew all too well that she was in earnest , perhaps even more so than she realized . I knew in that moment that somehow , deep within the blind instincts of her being , she had reached a crossway , the end of a clearly defined road . I sensed in one premonitory flash the swift events that were to propel her irrevocably toward a strange world in which I had no part . Naturally I urged myself not to be so serious , to realize that this was but an instant of high emotional tension . I put out my hand to stop her as she strode to her desk and seized her pen . She shook me off and , standing , scrawled on a sheet of notepaper a few words , which she passed to me . She had written : To the Directors of his Imperial Majesty 's Hofoper , it is announced that the connection of Lena Geyer with the Hofoper is hereby @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ General Direktor , Kapellmeister Gustav Mahler.  |p182I  urged her vainly to reconsider this hasty impulse ; in any event not to dispatch such a note until she had given the matter several days of thought . She shook her head vigorouslyas she placed her letter in an envelope , sealed it carefullywith red wax , and rang for Pierre , whom she directed to take it immediately to the office of the Intendant at the Opera . When he had gone , she brushed the tips of her fingers as if to remove every trace of the business . I pleaded with her further , but she only grew more stubborn . " Nothing , " she said firmly , " nothing in the world would induce me to change my mind . " It was only to be expected that the directors of the Hofopershould wait upon her in a body , which they did very shortly , and a bewildered and protesting group of gentlemen they were . My Lena received them calmly and graciously , had coffee and Wiener-bonbons served them , and when they began , one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she listened courteously to each , only to answer him briefly with politely worded regrets . At last when all had had their say the Intendant asked , " There is nothing , then , Frau Kammersangerin , that would induce you to withdraw your resignation ? " " Only one thing , " she answered with a grave smile , " and that would be the complete vindication and reinstatement of the Herr Dircktor . " The gentlemen regarded one another hopelessly , slowly shaking their heads and pursing their lips . " That , we regret to say , would be quite impossible , " they informed her . " In that case then , " she said rising , " I really do not see the need for further discussion . There is nothing more to be said . " " Just one thing remains . Gnadige Frau. " the IntendantP183said as he bent over her hand , " and the attorneys for the Hofoper will be on hand to say it tomorrow . I bid you good afternoon . " Lena threw me a quizzical glance @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell upon our ears . But when we were alone she shrugged her shoulders . " Let them sue me , " she said carelessly . " I can afford it . " " It might be much less expensive to come to a settlement with them , " I ventured . " I 'm sure it would , " she said with a yawn , " but it occurs to me that there will be a little world-wide publicity over this matter and that never hurts an opera singer . By the way , dear Louis , would you be so kind as to ask Monsieur le Marquisat the Embassy who is the best attorney in Vienna ? " I need hardly record in these pages that there was indeed " a little world-wide publicity " as the result of Lena Geyer 's break with the Hofoper . The matter never came to court , because public sentiment in Vienna was so strongly on the side of Mahler , and therefore upon that of my darling , who was considered to have done a magnificently daring thing . The directors @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opportunity to amplify the matter . A settlement was reached and my dear Lena paid a very large sum of money for the privilege of exercising her moral indignation . Indeed , I could not stomach the terms of the agreement , and positively sufferedat the size of the sum she was required to pay , but that in itself seemed to her only a justifiable feature of her attitudein the affair . When I pointed out that she had in a manner of speaking ruined herself in this cause , and left herself with a very small reserve of funds , she smiled wisely and said " Look at these . " And , in the sheaf of telegrams and letters she handed me were enough offers of guest appearances throughout Europe , P184at maximum fees , to guarantee her a larger income for the rest of the year than she would have earned at the Hofoper . " But next year , " I pointed out anxiously , " and the next ? Surely you must have a permanent appointment somewhere ? " " Surely I must , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to decide about that . " I could not believe , as the servants set about dismantling Lena 's beautiful flat , and packing all our treasures for shipmentto Paris , where they were to be stored , that the end of our precious five years ' idyll of Vienna had come . As this etching came down from the wall , that clock from the mantel , the Sevres cups from the tea-table , all to disappear into the packing boxes , my heart suffered bitter wrenches , each more painful than the last . Each tick of that little clock , every flower on the teacups , bespoke a warm and tender memory . I had purchased all these beloved little treasures for her delightand to adorn her home , just as I had assembled linens , laces , beautiful tableware , luxurious robes and cushions , a thousand exquisitely tasteful appurtenances of our life together . I have not hitherto dwelt upon the peculiar and the only really unfeminine element in my clear one 's nature , which was that she was singularly devoid of feeling toward a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that give it its intimacy and character , no interest whatever in its administrationand the arts of housewifery , and no sentiment about its associations . She was indeed sentimental but only in the matter of her personal feelings , not where she could be fixed in a literal attachment to a place or to things . On the other hand , I have ever had a most intense attachment to my home  --  really , to my homes  --  to my house in Paris , to Chartres where I was born and where every tree and stone 5and chair and tapestry has its secret meaning for me , and to the dear little sanctuary in Vienna where the most divine hours of my life were spent . I realize that the vast gulf of birth and background which separated me from my beloved was the basis of the great difference between us in this respect , yet I experienced the faintest twinges of regret that she could be and remain so free of the safe ties of the normal woman . Thus it was I who grieved and winced as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Lena was so preoccupied with her complicated plans for a week in this capital , a month in that , that she hardly noticed the confusion and the increasingdesolation around her . Only for her opera costumes did she show the slightest concern , and she spent one whole day with Dora and the large black notebook in which her gowns and accessories were inventoried , carefully checking every detail . Several new costume trunks were ordered , and all the costumes of thirty or more ro ' . es assigned to their proper places . Six new wigs must be made , twelve pairs of shoes , two dozen sets of the undergarments she wore upon the stage , and I fail to remember how many complete new costumes , for she assured me that once away from Vienna she was most unlikely to return , though she still felt the art of its costumers and dressmakers to be unparalleled . Not being a child , I did not call her attention to each bare wall and denuded little table as the servants finished their gloomy work , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ silence . She was too sensitive not to realize what I felt , but after making , once or twice , a visible effort to attune her mood to my subdued one , she astonished me , toward the end of that fantastic week , by leaping suddenly upon a chair , stretching out her arms as if to embrace the whole world , and bursting into Elvira 's scintillating cadenza , Un Eden 86quegli antri a me from Ernani  --  which I did not even realizeshe knew . I had never heard such a superb bit of coloraturasinging from her throat , and almost dropped the tiny marble Venus I was carefully handing to Pierre . I must have gazed at her in consternation and alarm , for she stopped singing , jumped from the chair and ran across the room to me . She threw her arms about my neck . " Forgive me ! " she cried . " Dear Louis  --  I am a beast . I know how you feel . I feel it too  --  but differently . I am all excitement ! " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I asked , putting my finger under her chin and tipping up her face to me . " You have no regrets for our happiness here ? " " I never have regrets for anything , my darling ! " she exclaimed , her eyes flashing . " I feel  --  everything  --  but I must look ahead . I want to look ahead ! " " Even to uncertainty ? " I asked her . " Even to all this mad travelling and living in trunks and portmanteaux ? " " I love it , " she cried eagerly . " I have n't known what was the matter with me lately . I must have been bored . I love to travel . I 'm a gypsy . I think this is wonderful "  --  and seizinga travelling rug from the top of a china barrel she flung it around herself , leaped once more upon her chair and began at the beginning of the glorious aria  --  Ernani , involami !  --  " Ernani , fly with me ! " P187THUS began the last half-year of my happiness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a day and many a week during those six months when my heart lay heavy in my breast , when my mind was uncertain and bewildered , and my will unaccountably paralyzed . For , once she had cast off from the anchor of her Vienna tenure , my dear Lena seemed to initiate a corresponding freedom from responsibility and establishment in all her ties . Her nature was too fine , and her emotions were too sincere to permit of her misleading me by demonstrations of affection she did not feel ; on the contrary I am very sure she felt warmer toward me , if anything , than before . Yet her warmth had a feverish and excitedquality , an element of suspense and mystery , which at the commencement of a love affair might be the most desirableof attributes , but in our circumstances made me very uneasy . From Vienna we travelled first to Berlin , where Lena wished to spend a few days in consultation with Frau Lehmann . There were many offers to be considered , many tentativeplans to be discussed . We took an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth retains the strongest sentimental association for me , but I remember that when I was directing Pierre to stipulate her old apartment of 1902 for us , she placed her hand on my arm and earnestly re , quested me not to engage that particular suite . Astonished , I asked her why . She looked very serious .   88 " We must never try to recapture or re-create , Louis , " she said earnestly . " Everything must go forward . Every experiencemust be a new one , a fresh start . If we ever thought to duplicate the experience with which those rooms are associated , we could only be disappointed . Please do n't let that happen . " Though I inclined to shrink from the import of her words , I knew she was right . We had three or four happy days in Berlin , but days not unmarked by a certain growing distractionin my dear one 's manner . Often she sat with me at table or in a carriage , ostensibly listening to my conversation , or even speaking herself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gleam in her eye , and a peculiar , absent expression in her face . This was particularly noticeable when we were together immediately after her return from one of her daily visits with Frau Lehmann , who was stirring my beloved Lena 's ambitions , not only in the direction of new and unconqueredfields , but by appeals to her to renounce all the ties that bound her to her present way of life . The very first time I had seen Lilli Lehmann , seated in Lena 's dressing room at the Hofoper , I had sensed instantly the full import of her attitude toward me . I knew she considered me at best an unfortunate attachment of Lena 's , at worst a calamitous obstacle to her career . Though I felt , as a just man , obliged to admire the great woman for her standards and her artistry , it was only to be expected that I dreaded and feared her as an influence over Lena . She epitomized everything from which I wished to keep Lena apart , and it was not long before a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ between us  --  each resolving to hold Lena to the allegiance we wished for her , by subtle and tacit demonstration of its advantages . We journeyed to St. Petersburg after Berlin . where Lena 89was to make guest appearances for three weeks at the MaryinskyTheatre . I believe her triumphs were nowhere greater . Though there is a close racial connection between the Slavic strains of the Czech and the Russian , my dear one had grown so cosmopolitan , both in her art and in her viewpoint , that she retained nothing of an original racial identity ; yet there was an opulent , luscious quality in her voice that was as truly Slavic as brilliance is native to a Latin throat or profundity to a Teutonic one . It must have been this , as well as the magnificence of her stage personality , that so completely capturedthe Russian nobility , who were , with the exception of a scattering of wealthy bourgeois , the only part of the populacefortunate enough to hear her sing . I was not particularly happy in Petersburg . Where I should have wished as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the evenings when she was not singing , I found myself beset with invitations from royalty and nobility in which she , of course , was not included . It had been my custom invariably to decline such invitations , but now she began urging me to accept them  --  for no reason , I could see clearly , except that she really wished to be alone . Rather than intrude in such circumstances , I betook myself to the palaces , the theatres , and the prodigious suppers , heartily bored with the barbaric ostentation and thoroughly disliking the food  --  which , with the exception of the caviar and the zakouskis , I considered impossible . Never have I seen the rarest vintages of our great champagnes consumed in more prodigious quantity , and never had I believed more sincerely in the sound , gratifying worth of the noble Bordeaux and Bourgognes that these dissipated Orientals could not appreciate . Perhaps it was because of the strained condition of my nerves , and because of my uneasy preoccupation with every detail that concerned my beloved , that an inchoate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ entertained about a certain identity became at this time an actual awareness of it . During a performance of Travtiata , as I surveyed the crowded house through my lorgnettes from the box of the Grand Duke Vladimir , I observed that a single seat toward the front of the stalls was occupied by a young woman who contrasted sharply with the magnificently gowned ladies about her . Attired in a severe black costume which completelycovered her arms and shoulders , simply coiffed , and without jewels , she could hardly have avoided appearing conspicuousin that glittering company . As I focussed the lenses upon her I was stirred by a peculiar conviction that this was not the first time I had so regarded this person . Upon makingsome effort of memory I believed , though I could not be positive , that I had seen her or her counterpart both in Vienna and in Paris during the past year . I thought this to be the case chiefly because of the strange familiarity of her presence in that particular location in the audience . Moved by growing curiosity , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , slightly to the left of the centre . I resolved from now on to watch this region in any house where my dear Lena was singing , to ascertain whether my surmise about the young woman was correct . Only a few weeks were required to determine that my suspicionwas grounded in fact . We travelled successively to Warsaw , to Munich , to Stockholm , to Copenhagen , and this young woman did , indeed , follow Lena Geyer from place to place . The curtain never rose upon an opera in which my dear one was cast that this strange person was not seated in her usual stall . I realized that such a seat , invariably in the same location , would not be easily obtained in the royal opera houses of Europe unless its purchaser were possessedP191either of considerable influence or of ample means . The young stranger was clearly eccentric , for she was invariably unaccompanied , and a lady does not go alone to the opera in a stall unless she is eccentric indeed . Her costume , always unvarying , likewise suggested @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that this , like hundreds of others , was a young woman with , as the Germans say , a Schwarrn for Lena Geyer , who had sufficient tact not to force herself upon her idol  --  which was most unusual . I asked my beloved if she were aware of this state of affairs . She shook her head . " No , " she said . " You know very well I never see anyone in the audience . " Then she paused , with a puzzled expression . " As a matter of fact , " she said , " I have heard people around the opera house mention something of the sort . I never pay any attention to Schwarmerei . I suppose , though , it 's the person who sends the flowers . I never thought of it before . " She shrugged . This fitted into the pattern of probabilities . I remembered that during the Paris season of 1905 , when I stopped one evening in my darling 's dressing room , I had noticed upon the divan a very large , indeed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful yellow roses . Though jealousy was my furthest motive , I could not restrain some curiosity as to the source of this very lavish gift . I made bold to inquire of my Lena as she put the final touches upon her make-up . She assured me she had no inkling of the sender 's identity , and picked up a card from the dressing table which she handed me . It bore neither name nor message , merely the initials " E. dell . " written in a fine hand . We had laughed about the little mystery and greatly enjoyed the beautiful roses in Lena 's salon , and I thought no more of the episode , which was of the commonest sort in Lena 's daily life . Yet before every performance , from that time forward , a florist 's box would be delivered in the dressing room , usuallycontaining some small , fragrant bouquet , and always , upon my dear one 's initial appearance of the season upon any stage , a mass of yellow roses . We decided , I remember , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , though exactly whom , even I , with my intimate knowledge of Parisian society , could not say . Eventually we took the unfailing floral gift of " E. deH. " for granted , and even grew into the habit of speaking of it as part of the routine . Once in Vienna when no flowers had appeared up to curtain time Lena actually became distressed ; she insisted she had grown to regard the mysterious flowers as her good-luck omen and she was afraid to go out upon the stage without receiving them . However , just as she left her dressing-room door , upon the call boy 's final knock , a breathlessflorist 's messenger burst into the corridor and all but flung himself upon her in his haste to deliver the flowers before she went on . It seemed he and his bicycle had become entangled in an accident with a runaway horse , the original flowers quite broken to pieces , and he had had to return to the shop for more . Once I suggested to Lena that she attemptthrough the florist either in Vienna @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but she turned a surprised stare upon me and exclaimed , " Why , Louis , my dear , I could not do that ! This person wishes to remain a mystery ; how unfair to spoil it ! " At the time , I was content to accept this rebuff , but now with all my senses sharpened to intrusive matters , I determined to disregard my beloved 's wishes . When we reached Paris  --  and only the good God knows with what fervent reliefand adoration I thanked Him for our return there  --  I went privately to the manager of the Opera and asked himp193to ascertain for me the name of the solitary young woman in the sixth-row stall . He demurred slightly , but in Paris I am , of course , always the master . Presently he furnished me with the name . It was Elsie deHaven , and he informed me further that the young woman was an American . Here was my mystery solved ; but as such things do in life , this matter became all at once a major and a distressing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her old friend , the Comtesse de Rancelles , and had not been long in the salon when Madame de Rancelles presented me to her " American niece , " as she put it , Mademoiselle deHaven . Even as I touched the fingertips of the young woman , I sensed a certain minute tension in the air , emanating from the fine-drawn intelligence and well-bred reserve of the people surrounding us . Instantly I felt that each spectator was secretly murmuring the name of my beloved Lena Geyer , and as I raised my eyes to those of the young woman whose hand I had just kissed , they met , despite her suitable shyness , a level glance of cold and comprehensive inquiry . I confess readily that this look was answered on my part with thoroughand clear-cut dislike . We bowed briefly and she moved away to another group of people . I felt as if a cold hand , nay , the fin of a cold-blooded creature of the sea , had swept over my heart . I brushed away this foolish notion and devoted myself to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young woman  --  who kept at the greatest possible distance from me  --  crossed my line of vision , I felt again the same sensation of dislike , of tension , yes , even of foreboding and fear . In a word , if she were as unnatural as my acute feelings seemed to be urging me to believe , then her worship of my darling Lena could be construedonly in the most horrible light ; and I boiled with fiery determination never to allow the two to meet . This anxiety coming upon the heels of all the distressing events of the past months produced in me a truly shocking nervous condition , and night after night I sat in my room after bidding my dear one good-night in the Rue Monsieur , grappling with the maddening , heart-rending aspects of my problem , seeking and striving to find a way out . Even then it occurred to me that the time might have come for me to offer to release my belovedfrom her alliance with me , but in the same breath I would realize that such a prospect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this very time of uncertainty and suspense in her affairs , she might at any moment need me more than she ever had before , and I wished in such a case to be unfailingly at hand . Toward the end of the Paris season , when we were preparing to go to London for Covent Garden , I ventured to ask her the question that was uppermost in my mind , and I felt  --  though she had consistently avoided reference to it  --  in hers also . This was the matter of her plans for the coming year . Munich , Dresden , Paris , and Brussels had all offered her contracts upon the most advantageous terms , yet she had accepted none , and seemed to be waiting , calmly enough , for I knew not what to develop . I asked her pointblank when she was going to make up her mind . She gave me a long , rather shrewd look . Then she said , " Not until after the Metropolitan 's representative has come to Europe this summer . " The blow had fallen in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ days with my dear one were numbered , and that she was definitely planning to go away across the water , to a world in which I had no part and indeed could wish to have no part . In profound sadness , with the cold hand of fate heavy on my shoulder , I prepared to accompany her to London ; prepared , too , for the inevitable parting that I hadP195decided neither to precipitate nor to forestall . I would yield to the dictates of destiny . In London it was impossible to simulate a joyfulness , an alacrity , or a spontaneity that neither of us felt . I was , I think , grave , tender , considerate , and scrupulous in my devotedattendance . She was thoughtful , gentle , and courteous . Yet each of us strained under the rapidly increasing burden of taut nerves and hypersensitive feelings . I know very well that it was , during the first ten days in London , more than once upon my lips to initiate the conversation that must terminate our liaison ; yet each time I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man such as Ito allow the first words to come from her . Looking back upon it , I believe I was crediting her with a degree of poise and savoir-faire that she had never really possessed , that she hoped that I would relieve the tension , and when I failed to do so , grew more restless and frightened until at last her nerves reached a state of desperation . I must , with an aching heart , record that she resorted to brusqueness , cruelty , and visibly : shortnessof temper . Alas , if I had only allowed a firm inherited pride to have its way with me , and to dictate my withdrawal from the situation , I could have saved both of us from distress . Instead , I was motivated by a peculiarly stubborn determination to force her to act ; and this was the state of our emotions upon the evening in June when , after she had sung  --  and so beautifully !  --  the Contessa in Nozze di Figaro , I repaired to her dressing room to escort her to her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to enter , I restrained a sudden impulse to recoil , for there upon the divan , sitting quietly and gazing into the mirror before which Lena was dressing her hair , sat the American woman , Elsie deHaven ! Never in all my life have I experienced a shock quite so distressing in its import , and only the natural sang-froid of 96a man of experience prevented my revealing the anger and repulsion that I felt . Yet even in that strange , highly charged moment , a flash of morbid intuition passed from me to the black-clad young woman ; a warning that we had never met before . She was not a person of subtle intelligence , I imagine , but she gathered and accepted my meaning , for as Lena presented me , she bowed impersonally and , with suitabletact , turned away to occupy herself with a vase of flowers , while I bent over to address Lena . My beloved  --  and despite the memory of that painful moment , and of all the pain she ever gave me , she remains my true and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the mirror and said with a nervous staccato I had never before remarked in her voice , " I do hope you 'll forgive me this evening , Louis ; I 've asked Miss deHaven to come back with me for supper . " My very marrow froze as I heard these words ; not only could I not protest , but nothing would have induced me to do so . It was not her rude treatment of me that so shocked me , as the knowledge that she had somehow met this woman of whom I believed only the most unpleasant things , and that she wished to associate with her . I made no attempt to conceal my displeasure , but bowed coldly and remained only to inquire if she wished me to drive them to the Savoy , or to leave my carriage for them . " No , thank you very much , " Lena said , busying herself with a manicure implement , and I could have groaned in the realization that she did not trust herself to look at me . My Lena , my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to this ! I bowed , murmured my respects , and departed , to spend a most bitter evening in contemplation of my ruined happiness , alone with a bottle of cognac and an odorous British coal fire . P197Only a few days more of torture remained for us to mete each other . My detestation of her American worshipper emanated not so much from jealousy as from actual fear of the nature of her attachment to Lena , though I have since received assurances from reliable persons that that fear was unfounded . Indeed , in all honesty , I must confess that even at that time I was not certain of my secret accusation . The more I observed the American , the more I realized that she was too young , too unworldly , and actually too much a lady to be guilty of an abnormality that I had first unhesitatinglyfixed upon her . It was more a case , I decided , of a wealthy , solitary , and intensely suppressed woman who was finding the outlet for her entire emotional existence in worshipof her ideal . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to my wounds . Two or three times in the ensuing week I found the American present when I entered Lena 's salon , and it may be imagined with what consternation I contemplated such a development in the life of a woman who had chosen for five years to have no intimate friend of either sex , and no companion save myself . Thus sorrow dogged my steps in those last days of June . I realized that the Covent Garden season would be over in a day or two ; that summer was upon us ; that Lena had made plans to join Lilli Lehmann in Salzburg without so much as consulting me about my own ; in short , that the break was a fait accompli in every respect but the verbal one . I had , after a sleepless night , made up my mind to take the initiative at last , when there was a knock upon my door , and Pierre admitted to my bedroom my dearly beloved Lena , attired in the smart tailleur in which she was dressed for her walk from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we had , by tacit agreement , not lodged at the same hotel . ) She came up to my bedside with the old fine , free stride , her great green eyes frankly and clearly holding mine , her strong white hands outstretched to me . " Louis , " she said , in the richest cadences of her beautiful voice , " I have come to say good-bye . " She sat down upon the side of the bed , keeping my hands clasped in her own . For a long moment there was silence . " I thank you for your courage , my darling , " I said . " This has been difficult for you . " She bowed her head and I felt her tears dropping slowly on our clasped hands . " I am so ashamed , " she whispered . " I have been such a beast . So cruel , so unworthy of you . " " There is no kind way to break a heart , my Lena , " I said . " I do not think we would have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She wept silently for a time . Then she spoke , very quietly : " You know why , Louis . You have always known , have you not ? " " Yes , " I answered . " I have always known you would take flight from my heart . But I have always hoped you would not have to . " " I must , " she replied . " I can not help myself . I am driven , forced  --  you understand me , my dear ? " " Perfectly . My only sorrow is that I thought you a superwoman  --  thatI had found the great artist who could be the great love as well . " Slowly she shook her head . " It can not be done , " she said . " I would only ruin myself and torture you by trying to do it . I am not the great love , dear Louis  --  for anybody . I can not be . I am only "  --  she made a futile gesture  --  " a throat . " " Do not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You are the greatest artist I have ever known  --  perhaps the greatest thereP199has ever been in your art . If I know this , and can say it at the price of my own happiness , you may believe that it is true . " She began to weep aloud , in slow , heavy sobs . I had seldomheard such sounds from her and they tore my heart . I longed to take her in my arms , yet felt restrained ; there seemed an invisible hand upraised to hold us apart . I kept her fingers in mine and gripped them tight . With great difficulty , she said , " I am not grieving for myself  --  I can not have safety and happiness  --  but for you . I ca n't bear to hurt you  --  Louis  --  Louis . " I leaned forward and with a motion brushed away the invisible barriers that kept us separated . I took her in my arms and clasped her to my breast . For the last time I kissed her rich , sensitive mouth , her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in their pallor . " Never grieve for me , " I whispered . " You have hurt me , yes , but that is all past . You have given me the greatest riches woman ever bestowed on man . I love you , always . Remember , though we never meet again . Promise me only that  --  that you know what it is to be loved . " " I promise , " she sobbed . " I know . " " Then God keep you always , my beloved . " She arose , her handkerchief before her face , and started to walk from the room . Suddenly she turned , strode to the windows , seized the cords of the curtains which were still drawn , and flung them wide . The morning sun pouredLifting her wet face she gave me one great , radiant smile . And then the door closed behind her . P200ELSIE DEHAVEN was buying ribbon at Harrods in Londonone afternoon in early June . She had been making small purchases  --  bootlaces , veils , hairpins  --  and now bought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their underclothes . She selected several pieces and gave the clerk her name and address , having to spell out the name to the girl . As she did so , she realized that a tall woman who had been standing beside her at the counter was for some reason not moving on . Miss deHaven finished spelling her name and turned , and the tall woman looked straight at her . She was Lena Geyer . " My knees went weak , " Miss deHaven wrote me , " and my eyes filled with tears . I could not speak . She pronounced my name in a deep , liquid voice while I grasped the counter for support . Elsie deHaven , ' she said . Are you the E. deH. who sends me yellow roses ? ' I was too stupefied to do anything but nod . The slender young woman in the black gown that follows me all over Europe ? And sits in a sixth-row stall ? ' She looked hard at me and I was surprised to see that her eyes were green . " I found @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you know ? ' " She laughed . I wish I could tell you the quality of that laugh . It was like a glorious red Burgundy flowing into a goblet , rich and lustrous and warm . How did I know ! ' she exclaimed . Did you think nobody knew ? My dear child , one does not have such an eccentricity without its being  | 1noticed . My manager knows it . Monsieur deReszke knows it . My  --  my friends know it . ' " I was sick with mortification . I remember hanging my head like a child caught in mischief . I wanted to crawl into a hole and cry . But Lena Geyer put her arm through mine . Come along and have tea with me , ' she said . We can have sandwiches and cake . I 'm not singing tonight . ' She chuckled and led me through the shop to the door where her carriage was waiting . My own carriage was there but I forgotit . We went to the Savoy where she was staying . All the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she spoke I can not remember what she said . Yet I have no recollection of awkward silence . I felt absolutely at peace , absolutely happy for the first time in my life . This was not like the happiness at the opera . This was something nobody could know but I , alone . " As we entered her apartment she pulled out her hatpins and lifted off her hat . I found that I was intensely curious to see her hair . I was so accustomed to her wigs that I could hardly realize she had any hair . It was brown , rather darker than mine , and simply dressed in a low pompadour with a chignon at the back . Her figure as she took off her jacket was superb . She stood very straight , with her wide shoulders held back like a soldier , and walked with a free stride that no ordinary woman could have copied . She moved about the room with peculiar litheness , and my first physical impressionof her was of tremendous vitality , trained and utilized to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ then came across to me holding out her hands . She asked me for my coat . I was so bewildered with joy that I let her take it as if I had been a child . Then she asked me to come and sit down with her by the window and talk , ' she said . We must get acquainted . '   " I do n't know what I meant to say but I blurted out my surprise that she spoke English , and without an accent . " She threw back her head and laughed . ' Why that 's not so odd , ' she said . ' You are an American , are you not ? ' " I nodded . ' So am I , ' she said with a shrug . " ' What ? ' I sat up as if I had been pinched . ' You an American ? I thought you were an Austrian , a German , or something . ' " ' I am , ' she said , ' but I lived in New York for years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ York came nearest to it . ' " I could hardly take this in . ' You mean you have been in New York ? ' I repeated . She assured me she had , that she had lived there and received most of her training there . I told her I thought she was Lilli Lehmann 's pupil . ' I am , ' she said , ' but I studied in New York a long time before that . ' " I was too surprised to speak . I watched her hands as she poured the tea , and was suddenly conscious that it was not the sort of thing she enjoyed doing . Her hands were large , unusually so , with square backs and long , rather thick fingers . The tips of them were blunt , heavily cushioned , and her nails were deep and filed quite short . The skin of her hands looked loose , as if they had never completely grown into it , though they were much too large for conventional standards . She wore no rings , and I never knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was married . When some royalty or patron presented her with a ring , which happenedrather often , she would have the stones reset into earringsor some ornament for her high collars . She wore high collars long after they went out of fashion . " That afternoon we talked a good deal , though I can hardly tell you what we said , for we were groping toward an understanding that soon made small talk superfluous . She was very curious about me , and without my realizing it drewP203most of my story out of me . She seemed to find it completelyincredible that anyone should make a whole life out of following her around to hear her sing . She insisted she could not see what I got out of it . I tried to tell her it meant as much to me as parents , a husband , children , or anything most women attach themselves to . She only shook her head and stared . She asked me if I meant to keep it up . I told her so long as she would let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say so long as I please you , ' she said . " Just then her maid came in , a large frowning woman she called Dora , whose story I will tell you later . Dora said in a low voice , ' Monsieur is here . ' Madame Geyer grimaced as she bit into a sandwich . ' Tell him I 'm resting , ' she said shortly . ' I 'll dine with him at nine . ' She ate with frank relish that I had never seen a woman show . She never nibbledanything , and she was not dainty in her appetite . You could not say she gobbled or did anything ungraceful , but she reminded me of a man when she ate . She grinned at me as she started on her third cake . Jour maigre tomorrow , ' she said . ' I 'm singing . ' " ' I know , ' I said . " She grinned again . That expression was so free , so gamine , it was the last thing one could possibly expect of an opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thrilled me . I knew she had a powerful personality , one could not hear her and not know that , but to discover this jolly , almost foolish human simplicity was tremendously excitingand surprising . Since I had never in my wildest dreams thought of meeting her I could not have anticipated her ; but if I had , I suppose I would have thought of her as rather distant , rather queenly . She was queenly enough in bearing , and in her manner in public , but alone at home she was a big overgrown girl .   " Presently I realized that I had stayed much too long . As I was drawing on my gloves she smiled at me and said , Look here , would n't you like to come back after the opera tomorrow night and see me ? ' " I nodded , too pleased to speak . She strode over to her writing table and scribbled a note on a pad . She told me to give it to the guard at the stage door , and she would be expectingme . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did not take it . She put both her hands on my shoulders and stood a moment looking into my eyes . Then she bent down and kissed me on both cheeks . Thank you , ' she said suddenly . I never knew what she meant by that . But I was too overwhelmed by my experience to wonder about it . " The following night she was to sing a part I particularly loved , the Contessa in Nozze di Figaro . It was one of the parts that best displayed her wonderful musicianship , superficiallysimple in comparison with the great , complicated Wagnerian ones , but really much more exacting . She had tremendous respect for it , and I have known her at the height of her fame to practise the phrases of Dove Sono with all the earnest humility of a student . In character she was the ideal of the role , noble and restrained and deeply emotional . When she made her entrance , my heart leaped with a new sort of recognition . I felt in a way as if something of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the stage to do it , I had a feeling she might glance toward the place where she knew I sat . I had sent her that evening not only yellow roses , but a hamper of flowers , losing all sense of proportionin my new excitement about her . " After the opera I went to her dressing room . When you realize how glamorous a prima donna 's dressing room is even to a sophisticated person , you may imagine how I felt . P205I was goggle-eyed with wonder . I knocked timidly and the door was opened a crack . Dora eyed me through it , then opened the door just wide enough for me to come in . She shut and locked it behind me . Along one wall there was a large dressing table with a huge mirror , entirely surrounded by lights . Madame Geyer sat before it on a stool . I had never seen anyone closely in make-up . ( In those days we did not use rouge and lipstick as they do now . ) Her face startled me . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Yesterday she had looked natural , and on the stage she had , but at this close range she was so distorted that for a moment I could hardly understand the change . She laughed , and held out one hand . Do n't come too close till I take off this muck , ' she said in a whisper , or you 'll spoil that beautifulblack dress . ' She gave me a deliberate wink . I was vainly trying to tell her how beautifully she had sung , but no words seemed to come out . " Dora was busy unhooking the tight bodice of the eighteenth-centurygown . Madame Geyer stood up and shook herself . The whole thing slipped off around her feet , leavingher in a high-busted corset and a pair of lacy cambric drawers . I must have shown the question in my mind  --  how could she sing in such stays ? She answered me by remarking that she was about ready to throw them all into the fire and start a vogue for natural lines on the stage . The sequel to that is that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harness . As she did so , Madame Geyer groaned and stretched delightedly , then slipped a dressing gown over her shoulders and sat down again while Dora took off her white wig . Without the wig , and still with the make-up , she looked too grotesque for words . Her eyes were lined and beaded with black and blue , her eyebrows caricatured in heavy arcs , moreP206awful because of a tight white bandage around her hairline . She dipped her two hands into a big pot of white grease and slapped it all over her face and throat . Sit down , ' she croaked at me . I was a little puzzled by the voice , but realized that it must be something singers did to rest their throats after singing . As she started to wipe off the thick , dirty mess , her own face emerged , white and fine-textured as I had seen it yesterday . Immediately I felt much better . Then she took the bandage off her forehead , and Dora brushed her hair vigorously . " Just as she was twisting it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dora admitted a tall man in an Inverness cloak , with an opera hat under his arm . He had a short , pointed black beard and a haughty manner . As I recognized him  --  the Duc de Chartres , whom I had met in Madame de Rancelles ' drawing room  --  he caught sight of me sitting on the divan , and an expression of terrible anger flashed across his face . It was gone at once , and as he bent over to kiss Madame Geyer 's hand he fixed me with a cold , narrowed , meaning glance of his eyes . I knew he meant me to gather that we were complete strangers , though I could not understand his motive . I knew of no reason why we should not have met . " Madame Geyer introduced us and he bowed most coldly . I turned away and he spoke to her in French , telling her that the carriage was ready . At that she almost completely upset my poise by telling him that he must forgive her , she had invited me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ done nothing of the sort and I was overcome by surprise . But since she had so thrown the situation into my hands , I could not make my excuses and leave , though that was what he would have had me do . I was learning fast , I realized , whenp207that was my first encounter with anything related to intrigue or the deeper currents of human motives . It was the duke who said good night . As he bent over her hand he asked her something I did not hear . She shook her head and brusquely , I thought , said Non , impossible . Bon soir . ' Even an innocent like myself could see that he was receiving a sharp dismissal . " Madame Geyer washed her face vigorously with soap and water , brushed it over with powder , which she rubbed off with a piece of chamois , and quickly put on the clothes Dora handed her . She wore two or three layers of soft underclothing , without corsets , and a long , loose dress of dark red wool . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pair of velvet carriage boots , and put on a heavy black cloak lined in quilted silk that covered her completely , with a hood over her head . Come on , ' she said to me . I had not really thought she meant I was to go home with her but when I saw that she did , I went along without hesitation . In the corridorshe stopped suddenly with a look of consternation . She had no carriage , she had sent the duke away . " I told her my carriage would be waiting , which I had completely forgotten , with poor Mademoiselle , my chaperone , inside . We sent the guard to the front door to have it sent round to the stage entrance . When Mademoiselle saw me emerging from the stage door with Lena Geyer ( she knew it could be nobody else ) she forgot her fright at my disappearanceand gaped like an idiot . I presented her to Madame Geyer , who promptly made herself charming to the old spinster . We got out at the Savoy and sent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and tell the coachman to come back and wait for me at the Savoy . I saw she was shocked at such a departure but I did not care .   " There was a good fire burning in Madame Geyer 's sitting room and a supper table set for two drawn up before it . She looked at it and laughed as she threw off her cloak . Poor Louis , ' she said . I am ashamed of myself . You are going to eat his supper . ' " Much to my own surprise I found myself telling her I thought she should indeed be ashamed . I told her she had been cruel , and even rude . Then the enormity of my impudencecame over me and I burst into tears . Madame Geyer strode across to me and put her arms around me . She was a head taller than I and I shrank against her . She was strong and warm . She stood there holding me for several minutes while I sobbed like a child . I was so unnerved by the emotionsof the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself . For the first time in my life I was freely and utterly giving way to deep feeling . Lena Geyer pressed my head against her shoulder and murmured to me in German , tender broken phrases that one would use to a child . I felt as if I should die for love of her . I could not get my breath . Presently she drew away and put her hand under my chin and shook her head and whispered , You funny little girl . ' Of course I know now what was puzzling her , but at that time such was my innocence that I had no idea of the ambiguity of my situation and my emotions . Although the world has since said many cruel things about this strange , almost passionate friendship between Madame Geyer and myself , I need hardly assure you that not one word of the essential accusation is true . Call me a freak if you like  --  the fact remains that my feeling for Lena Geyer was childlike in its simplicity , and yet more powerful than any other emotion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her I tried to say something , but could only gasp . She nodded slowly . She said , I know . ThereP209is no explaining these things . You are n't a child any more . How old are you ? ' " Twenty-two . ' " Ten years younger than I. Have you any friends ? ' " I told her no , no friends anywhere . " She said she had none either . She had everything else  --  sponsors , patrons , admirers , her two beloved teachers , a lover  --  but no friend . She smiled at me with tears in her eyes . Perhaps we need each other , ' she said . And then , in the next breath , But I 'm a devil , I warn you ! Sometimes you 'll hate me ! ' " I said I could never hate her . I said  --  to this day I wonderhow I summoned the courage  --  that I loved her . She put her arms around me again and kissed me . Then she took her handkerchief and dried my eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Stop crying , ' she said . It makes your nose red . ' " Our supper came and she sniffed the dishes with delight . She said she really felt very guilty . Louis had ordered her favorite Mozart dishes and she had sent him away . I asked her what she meant by Mozart dishes and she told me that she always preferred certain foods after certain music  --  special ones for Mozart , Bellini , Verdi , Wagner , and the rest . This sounded too ridiculous to me . Not at all , she said , eating was as much a part of life as singing and she loved to eat . Different music put her in the mood for certain foods just as it made one gay or sad . I had never heard anything so curious . The Mozart supper consisted of a rich consomme with egg balls , fried chicken  --  Wiener Backhdnderl , she called it  --  a delicious mixture of rice and green peas highly seasoned with herbs , asparagus , and a Himmeltorte . She said this was a special occasion @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I protestedP210that I hardly ever drank wine and that it made me dizzy . Then I would have to learn , she said , if I spent much time with her , because wine was the finest thing in the world and food was meaningless without it . " I had never had such an evening . Actually I think that was the first meal I had ever eaten ; all the others were just food I had consumed in the routine of existence . Her appetitewould have made anyone feel good . She picked up her chicken and her asparagus in her fingers and even licked them once or twice , but though this looks terrible written down on paper , she did it with such charm and such childlike relish that it never suggested bad manners to me . My mother would probably have swooned at such a sight . She talked steadily , making an effort to whisper , but often forgetting and burstinginto a loud laugh . There was an awkward moment when I asked her something and called her Madame Geyer . She looked at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  I was supposed to call her Lena . She had a way of envelopingme with her enthusiasm and warmth ; it was like walking into a warm , beautiful room after being out in a cold rain for a long time . " When I remembered suddenly that I had a carriage waitingI looked at my watch and it was nearly two o'clock . I had never been up so late in my life . I jumped up , frightened . She looked up at me lazily . What difference does it make ? ' she asked . Who is going to punish Cinderella for staying out late ? ' " ' Why  --  nobody ! ' I said with surprise . " Exactly , ' she nodded . You must not be such a timid little mouse . Do as you please . Be careless . ' " This advice coming from her was more startling than literal , since she was the least careless person in the world . But it was typical of the effect she had on me  --  relaxing myp211superficial repressions . I had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to a rigid code ; she did everything to free me from this . As I was leaving she asked when I could come and see her again , knowing well that I was too shy to suggest it . I told her whenever she wished . She said she would send me word . Tomorrow she would have to devote the whole clay to Louis . For a moment I was tempted to be rash and give her some more unsolicited advice . But without any background of experience , advice of that kind coming from me would seem thoroughly ridiculous , so I restrained myself ; though it was not long before I discovered that with or without experience , the advice I felt impelled to give her was usually right . It was one of the queer bonds that held us together . There were often times when I could not make a decision for myself but could trust myself to make them for her . " Within two weeks after our first evening together I was seeing Lena Geyer every clay . She lived a life of orderly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ send me a message early in the morning asking if I wished to go walking with her , and at ten I would meet her at the door of the Savoy . We would start out on one of what we called her treks . Any walk shorter than a mile was useless to her . Two miles was a decent walk , and what she liked better was about four . I was not used to such exercise and at first I would he so exhausted that I fell asleep the moment I sat down . One night when we had walked for three hours in the morning I fell asleep at the opera , though to he sure it was during Wotan 's and Fricka 's discourse in Die Walkiire ; I was wide awake when Lena was on the stage . Her Sieglinde was like her Elisabeth , the utmost and ultimate expression of the perfect feminine . Sieglinde is an elusive and exceedinglydifficult role , its chief demand upon the singer being not I 2 so much vocal as human . If she is a trivial and superficial @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fine her voice . There have been only a few memorable Sieglindes since Wagner composed the opera , though every capable dramatic soprano has sung it . Olive Fremstad was often called the greatest , but in her time Lena Geyer was the only Sieglinde . She used to move through the part building up an atmosphere of loneliness and terror and tragedy , against which the passion of her love for Siegmund was like fire . When she came on in the second act , stumbling and clinging to Siegmund , her whole story was told in the lines of her body and the way her voice came from deep down in it rather than from her throat . Her impersonation was almost unbearably revealing of a woman 's heart . The only Sieglinde I have heard to compare with it is that of Lotte Lehmann , who sings it today  --  she has what Lena had , the resources of a noble character and intense emotion . " Lena loved the part and felt it so deeply that it was one characterization from which she did not rebound immediately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or two afterward . There was no jolly smile for anyone who called at her dressing room then . She hardly noticed who came . At first I did not go to her dressing room unless she asked me to , and sometimes she said nothing about it and I did not go back . She would give me a sharp sidelong look the next morning and ask me why I had not come . My real reason for hesitation had to do with the duke , but I did not presume to tell her that . " I was distinctly uneasy about him and about her treatmentof him  --  there was so much I had been brought up deliberately not to understand ! But I soon gathered most of the hidden details from Lena 's manner . It was very difficult for her to hide anything from me , and in this case she did 1 3not try . I always found plenty to criticise in Lena , and could never pretend that I thought her perfect . I was rather more shocked by her method of terminating this liaison @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for it seemed to me that she was awkward and cruel about it . He was a gentleman , a man like my own father and brother , but with far more sensibilityand artistic taste than they had had . Yet she was treating him as if he had been a boor . " Any understanding of Lena 's attitude toward men must lie in a knowledge of her early life , where some things happened that she never told even me about . Not until she was dying and the doctors made some astonishing revelations to Henry and me did I know her story completely . Some of it I could not be induced to touch on . I do know that the things that happened in her early and bitter obscurity were such as to make her suspicious and harsh toward most men . Louis de Chartres was bowled over by her and he swept away her bristling defenses with glowing promises of what love could be . Indeed , I think that , in accepting his advances , curiosity was her most important motive . You realize that she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and deprivation  --  herlife as a student had been austere to the last degree , and the explanation of her love of eating lies in the dry black bread and cups of unsweetened tea that she had lived on . The wonder is that she did not succumb utterly to the life of luxury and pleasure that Louis de Chartres held out to her . He offered her beauty , amusement , and a chance to enjoy the things that other people want . She had a competitivestreak , and when she started at the Paris Opera in I902 she soon saw that most opera singers had wealthy or titled lovers , and that those who did not were all longing to capture the Duc de Chartres . She never thought of him as a means of furthering her career or as an introduction to desir/able contacts . She was intrigued by his good looks , his money , and the fact that if she were his mistress she would be the envy of Europe . Such , I think , were her motives . " Yet on the whole she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt . She had accepted him the year before I was first in Paris with Madame de Rancelles , and for nearly five years thereafter she said she found everything in the connectionthat he had promised her ; and she really loved him . But the time finally came when her ambition reasserted itself and made her realize that a love affair was a tremendous hindrance ; and instead of telling him frankly that she wanted to part , she made the decision in her own mind and said nothing to him . I criticise her for this . I think it was weak and unkind . Once she realized that she was going to send him away , she began to feel differently toward him , and her taste for the pleasures he provided faded . His conversation bored her . She became cold and short with him , and this maddened him , for he was proud and exceedingly . jealous . A man of his type would inevitably assume that any termination of a liaison ought to come from him . " About a month after I first knew @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Covent Garden season was just closing and she was making her summer plans . She was striding along in a full skirt , while I trotted beside her . She took one step to my two ; it was a long time before I learned how to walk comfortably with her . She was in a silly mood that day , and had invented a game of counting all the women we passed that had buck teeth . Most Englishwomenbeing unfortunately so afflicted , she was very busy . But I was preoccupied . I had had supper with her the evening before and she had been unkind to Louis again , sendinghim word at the last minute that he could not join her . I stopped her as she counted the forty-seventh set of buckP215teeth and asked her frankly if she had thought to use me , that very first evening , as a means of getting rid of Louis . " She dropped her game and turned to me with a stare . For a moment I thought she was going to evade me and tell a lie  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . She said , I 'm afraid so , Elsie . ' There was a long silence . Then she said , Can you forgive me ? ' " Of course I could forgive her anything . My feelings had not been hurt anyway . If she had used me , just that once , and never seen me again , my life would have been richer for one hour close to her . But I was heartsick on Louis 's account . In a way he and I were on one side of a fence and Lena was on the other . She was our opposite  --  the simple explanation of why we both loved her so much . I was ashamed for her that she could do anything so cheap , yet I had to tell myself that she was really a peasant , with no background , no social training , not so much knowledge of that part of the world as even an innocent like me . I at least had a tradition to go by . She had nothing . " I wonder now as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turn the relationship between us from Lena as the leader and myself as the worshipping satellite to myself as preceptor and Lena as an humble child listening to me . I did this now . T told her she was doing a disgraceful thing , much more disgracefulthan the questionable morality of having been Louis 's mistress in the first place . I told her she owed him nothing , nor he her , except respect and courtesy , neither of which things she was showing . And in acting as she was , she was doing herself great harm . I accused her of cowardice , which was all that had kept her from being fair with Louis . I told her that though I would always love her , no matter what she did , she would lose my esteem unless she faced this question squarely and acted honorably about it . Itp216may seem presumptuous for me to have told her she would lose anything in my eyes , but by that time I realized that she was growing dependent on me , and she knew it too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a person , even though on the stage she always overwhelmed me with her genius and power . When she was singing she was not my Lena , she was the unapproachable Madame Geyer . " There was nothing unapproachable about her now . She put her hand on my arm and told me she knew I was right . She was being cowardly . She had wanted for months to tell Louis it was all over , but what she felt worst about was the way she had abused my devotion . It was a filthy thing to do , ' she said . I am disgusted with myself . I thought at the time , what harm if I take the little thing home with me  --  it will thrill her and I 'll let her down easily afterward . You see  --  I did n't know you  --  not until you spoke up there in my sitting room . ' " You know me now , ' I said . There is n't much to know . ' " There 's enough so that I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ invisible necessity . ' " She promised me that she would speak to Louis immediately , and I told her I would not come to see her again until it was all settled . I did not want her to lean on me and prolongher state of indecision . " The next night I received a message from her asking me to come early the following morning . When Dora let me in , Lena was standing in the middle of the sitting room in a striped taffeta petticoat and a ruffled pink combing jacket , singing her scales in fullest voice and winding up each one with an arpeggio that made my skin tingle . In a small room her voice sometimes sounded unbearably big . This morning it was like an army crowded into a box-car . She was pointingand motioning to Dora and two hotel maids who wereP217all rushing round packing things into a row of trunks standing in the hallway . Tissue paper was waist deep all over the room . There was a pile of boxes from the opera house full of costumes , and Lena 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Elsa , was hanging from the chandelier , freshly braided . Dora was scowling as usual , the only person in the room with any notion of what she was doing ; but Lena was so bursting with energy that she had to pretend to supervise , though she knew no more about packing than I did about singing . " ' What is this ? ' I asked . " Lena stopped in the middle of a shake and nearly knocked me down with a bear hug . ' Hiniznlisch ! ' she cried . ' Frei ! 0 wunderschoner Freiheitstag ! ' " I never knew what language she might speak when she was excited . If she were angry it was apt to be Italian . If mischievous , French . If ecstatic , German . Once in a while she would explode into a hideous gibberish nobody could understand . That was Czech , her native tongue . Today she was a child . She picked up her petticoat in one hand and me in the other and whirled around the room like a dervish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hold of a chair as we whirled by it and sat down . ' Are you crazy ? ' I asked her . " ' Gewiss ! ' she shouted . ' Ganz verriickt ! Hoch ! Heil ! Hooray ! ' " I asked her why the sudden packing . ' Because we 're going , ' she exulted . ' Leaving this afternoon . Are you ready ? ' " ' Am I ready ? ' I thought she had really lost her wits . I told her to sit down and try to make sense . She plunked down on the floor beside me and put her hands on my knees . ' You and I , ' she said like somebody talking to an infant , ' and 1 8Dora and Nellie and Mademoiselle and anybody else we ca n't get rid of are going to Salzburg this afternoon ! ' " Of course I told her it was impossible . And of course I knew at once that it was exactly what I would do . I tried to tell her there was no hurry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She would not listen . Nein , ' she said , shaking her head like a mechanical toy , vein , heute fahren wir alle weg ! ' " I sent a messenger rushing to my hotel with a note to Mademoiselle and my maid Nellie . I knew they would take it more calmly and actually get packed if I did not come back . It fell to me to get the tickets for the party  --  Lena had completely overlooked that , having had Louis to do such things for her before . By the time everything was ready and I had made two flying trips between her hotel and mine , we converged on Victoria Station in two phalanxes each with a wagonload of luggage . Dora was surly and matter-offactas usual ; none of this was news to her . Nellie was so flustered that she had put her skirt on inside out  --  fortunatelyit was black and did not show much . And Mademoisellewas almost dead . She arrived at the train holding a fan and a smelling-bottle and calling le bon Dieu to witness @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's child . Crossing on the boat to Holland , Lena and I were standing together by the rail , alone . She had quieted down . All the nonsense had been in her rooms . In public she was always very sedate . Actually she was beginning to feel apprehensive ; she was an abominable sailor . So her pallor and her unearthly look were perhaps not caused by the emotionsthat they might have been . Presently I asked her if Louis had understood . He did understand , ' she answered , and you were right . I was a beast , vulgar and cruel . ' " P219THE Duc DE CHARTRES was inclined to attach suchominous significance to Elsie deHaven that it is now time to tell the truth about her , and to realize that she was far more pathetic than sinister . She was shy , homely , inarticulate , the spinster daughter of a wealthy American family , who was left quite alone in the world by the death of her parents . Her devotion to Lena Geyer is proverbial wherever Geyer is remembered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attachment that anyone so much as questioned the nature of it . It soon became clear to all who knew her that Elsie  --  or as she was always called , Elsa  --  deHaven wanted and expectednothing more of life than the privilege of living with Lena Geyer and of acting as companion , secretary , housekeeper , amanuensis , and confidante . It was , after all , not a barren life . Miss deHaven could not help growing in personality and broadening in point of view , until when I knew her she was a real character , with a particularly dry kind of wit , and a merciless eye for a fake of any sort . As she grew older she seemed to shrink in size  --  not that she had ever been very large  --  and she reminded me of a small gray and black bird , perched on the back of Lena Geyer 's chair , with its head cocked and its bright beady eye missing nothing . Miss deHaven was prevailed on by Madame Geyer herself to help me with material for this book . At @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I sensed that to her I was just a young upstart , with perhaps the additional stigma of Semitic intelligence of a quicker type than she thought correct or tra-P220ditional for a publisher . A publisher , in her mind , should be sedate , grave , and redolent of old American tradition , like Richard Watson Gilder , who had been her father 's close friend , and of whom she often spoke to me in rather reproachfultones . She was genuinely shocked when Madame Geyer and I both brought pressure on her to reveal everythingof her own life that had a bearing on Lena Geyer , and everything in Lena Geyer 's life , of which she knew more than anyone in the world . But when she capitulated she did so completely , and I feel no greater debt of gratitude to anyone , in connection with this work , than I do to her . Since Madame Geyer 's death Miss deHaven has spent most of her time on the French Riviera in a little house they had sometimeslived in together , and has written me long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ these letters are so intimate and so colorful , especially when you bear in mind the timid , reticent woman who wrote them , that I am quoting them in their entirety . The explanation of Miss deHaven 's friendship with the Comtesse de Rancelles , and of how she first heard Lena Geyer sing , is contained in the first letter she wrote me after she sailed for Europe last year . I had asked her to include enough of her own background to fix herself as an identity in the story . " If you have read Mrs. Wharton 's novels of the seventies and eighties in New York , " she wrote me , " you will understand the type of family and position I was born into . My father was Gerald Dyckman deHaven , a descendant of two old New York strains , the Dutch and the Huguenots , who settled around New Rochelle . My mother was Elsie ElizabethArchibald , whose ancestors were in New York before the Revolution . My parents lived in a brownstone house in East Thirty-sixth Street , which I still own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ estate near Tarrytown , where my nephew , my brother 's only son , lives now . I was born in New York in 1885 , and brought up in the most rigid conventionalpattern . I went to the young ladies ' school where my mother had been educated , and it was planned for me to make my debut the winter I was eighteen . I finished at Miss Vandevanter 's School when I was seventeen , and my mother had intended to take me abroad for part of the intervening year . " I dreaded the thought of coming out ' and of all the sequels to it . I was much too young to know why I did not like them , or to think of any alternative . I was excessively shy , and we were an undemonstrative family . My father was so reserved that I think of him to this day with awe and respect , never with ordinary affection ; he was too distant to command it . My mother was submissive with him and gentle with my brother and me , though she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever opposed her . We were expected to obey unquestioningly . Indeed I never thought of doing anything else , but when I was alone I used to give way to fits of real terror at the prospect of the life ahead of me . I was not pretty and was well aware that my plain looks were causing my mother great worry . Once I overheard her say to her sister that she did not see how Elsie could ever hope to fix a young man 's attentions , or find a husband . I daresayI should have felt badly , but I remember a definite sense of relief at what I had heard . If my own mother did not think me attractive enough to win a husband , I need not worry that it was positively expected of me . " My mother was planning to take me to Europe in the spring of 1903 , and to stay there , making what used to be called the grand tour , until the late fall , when I should be brought home and presented . But in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and remained an invalid for the rest of his life . My mother did not feel that she could leave him , yet she was determined that I should have my finishing abroad . She arranged with the Comtesse de Rancelles , a girlhoodfriend of hers , to take me into her home in Paris and to chaperone me and supervise the finishing of my education . My governess took me across on the ship , and turned me over to Madame de Rancelles . The old countess was a great lady and a great woman of the world , thoroughly in accord with all my mother 's ideas , yet sophisticated in the Continentaltradition of older women as my mother could never have been . She understood my mother 's problem so thoroughlythat , as I found out years later , she offered to find me a good parti in Paris , regardless of my plainness , because I was a well-born heiress . Such a sensible arrangement , she assured my mother , could only be made in a civilized country , never in the States . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the mind and heart far beyond anything I had known before . I think she believed that whether I married or not , I would never develop a taste for superficial pleasures or society or flirtation . In New York , young girls were never exposed to anything , no matter how proper , in the world of art , until after their debuts and marriages . Then they made sedate expeditions to galleries to see paintings , and to the opera for one purpose only  --  to be seen . The woman or man in my world who thought of the opera as anything but a social display case , with arias sung by famous artists as accompaniment , was a rarity . I had never sat in my family 's box at the Metropolitan because that was not done until after one 's debut ; therefore I had never heard an opera . Madame de Rancelles ' ideas were otherwise . Jeune fille though I was , she saw to it that I was introduced to art and music . She saidp223this must be done so that I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I think now that she foresawthe sort of person I have become , and what music has meant to me . Of course I had been taught to play the piano , in a manner I blush to think about . Madame dismissed that with a wave of her hand . Play if you wish , ' she used to say , play your pretty ballads , but please , saga chere , do not play them where anyone will hear you ! ' " I arrived in Paris late in April , just when the spring season was beginning . Madame de Rancelles established me in her house in a position I had never occupied before ; the daughter of the house , the sheltered feline fine , liable to be sent out of the room if the conversation took certain turns , but at the same time included in far more than had been the case at home . She had a beautiful old hotel off the Boulevard Saint-Germain , and she received the most staid Parisian societyon her afternoons . In view of the world as I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ really what the fast world calls stuffy Saint-Germain , ' but to me she seemed to lead a life of wonderful freedom . She went to the opera every ten days or two weeks . Strangely enough , although Madame took extreme care what conversation I heard , what books I read , and what paintings I saw , she made few reservations about the opera . For one thing the technique of acting in those days , as practised by most singers , was so guarded as to remove much of the significance from the most lurid libretto . " A few weeks after I arrived in Paris Madame told me at dejeuner one day that that evening we were going to the opera , and that it was to be more than usually interesting . A singer from Vienna , who had made her Paris debut the previous year , had returned for her season and was to sing Elisabeth in Tannhauser tonight . I was already so thrilledp224by my three or four tastes of opera that I attached no specialsignificance to any one singer ; I had heard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but all had enchanted me equally . I knew they were supposed to be very great , but I was still too dazzled by their glamour to understand singers as personalities . And I had never heard a Wagner opera . I think up to that time I had heard Lucia , Le Prophete , Faust , and Don Giovanni . " We arrived late at Tannhauser , perhaps because it was the first opera to which she took me in which Madame thought there was anything to fear on my account . Thereforethe Venusberg scene , which she wished to avoid , was over when we took our seats in her box . Jean deReszke was singing . I can see myself still , erect and uncomfortable in my stays which Madame 's maid had laced so tightly , with a high round neck and puff sleeves , as became my age , in contrast to Madame 's decollete gown . I wore my hair , which was straight and a colorless shade of brown , marcelled in a pompadour off my forehead , and of course long gloves , up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tight I could hardly move my hands . Those clothes were intensely uncomfortable , yet we wore them without thinking to object . They had a great deal to do with the stiffness of our manners , and I was terribly shy and awkward besides . " The first act ended , with the marvellous sextette and deReszke 's voice soaring above it . I had never heard such music , and sat stunned all through the first intermission , while Madame conversed with her friends . A deReszke night was always a great occasion , but the gentlemen who came to pay their respects to Madame were also full of talk about the new soprano who would appear in the next act . She was young , Lilli Lehmann 's most brilliant pupil , and une fine .... ! I can still remember the expression on the oldp225Marquis de Fontnouvelle 's face as he rolled his eyes toward the chandelier . I also caught a whisper about Chartres ' as de Fontnouvelle bent over Madame 's shoulder , but had no idea what he meant , and knew well that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Our visitors retired and the lights went down . The orchestra began the opening bars of the second act and the curtains parted on the great Wartburg Hall . In the rear centre of the bare stage was a great door , and through this suddenly swept a tall , radiant figure in a flowing white satin robe , with a pearl halo above her long golden hair . Her arms were raised in a joyful gesture , and her face glowed with a rapturous smile . This was the first real emotion I had seen on an opera singer 's face , and before I could realize my own joy , she had let out a sweep of glorious sound that I shall never forget . I am sure that such radiance , such glory , has never poured from a human throat . At first I was too thrilled to breathe ; I remember how the pulse in my throat choked me . And when she was halfway through the greeting , and I had regained my balance from the shock , I sat letting it rush @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lived before . When you realize that emotion , as we use the word , was actually unknown to me until that time , that the strongest feeling I had ever had was pleasure in a new pet , or fright from shyness , you may be able to understand what that experience did to me . It was exactly like the unlocking of a prison door . The voice poured into me , and from that moment it became the one thing I cared to live for . The whole identity that my parents had so carefully created melted in the force of the singing I heard that night . All the barriers built up by convention and habit seemed to shrivel , and I felt in those few moments a free and purposefulindividual . I did not even know I was repressed , orP226inarticulate , yet once I felt freed , I knew that I had never lived before . " After the duet with deReszke there was a demonstration . I was oblivious of that . I merely sat there with my eyes riveted on the singer , thrilled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ technique , but there again , I did not know what thrilled me . I was too childish and simple . I had never seen anything like it before , and I have not seen its equal since . During the second intermission I sat in my corner and stared at one spot on the closed curtain , through which in my imagination the singer was still visible . Madame paid no attention to me ; the box was buzzing with excited comment about the extraordinary performance . In the third act , when Elisabeth knelt at the foot of the cross and sang the Prayer , I was carried in the other direction from my first excitement and was , for the first time in my life , moved to tears . One could not cry in public in those days ; the kid gloves and tiny lace handkerchiefs would have made it impossibleeven without the uses of convention . I was in agony , trying to dry my tears and stifle my snuffles without ruining my gloves . This seems ridiculous now , yet it was all part of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , drooping and heartbroken , a profound and pitiful contrast to the joyful maiden of the second act , dragged herself sadly off the stage , I sat back and closed my eyes . I did not want to see or hear anything more ; I had already received more than I could hold . Not until we were in the carriage on the way home did I look at my program and really learn the name of the singer . It was Lena Geyer , and it immediately became a rhythm in my head that went on , over and over , all that night , and for many nights to come . The sound of her voice stayed with me too , and became a physical sensation , almost like a taste , that one can recall at will . I haveP227heard Lena Geyer so many times now that the memories of many individual performances are blurred , but her Elisabeth remains to me the height of human inspiration . She truly lived every part , but to me nothing compared in power and force with that one , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is the account of how I first saw and heard Lena Geyer . It was a long time before I met her , and many things happened meanwhile . " One taste of happiness and freedom had made the routine of her old life at home intolerable to Elsie deHaven . Her father 's death forced her return to New York after she had been with the Comtesse de Rancelles for six months . She reached home to find her mother and brother ( a narrowmindedyoung man ) thoroughly enjoying their mourning in the midst of shrouded furniture , black clothes , and total incarcerationfrom the world . Elsie 's only ray of consolation was that she was now not expected to make a formal debut into society . Instead , she quietly made plans to go to the opera as much as possible that winter . Even though this was years before Geyer came to the Metropolitan , she could fill the blank pages of her life with the music she had learned to adore . But this was not Paris , and Elsie 's plans to indulge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day she tried to put them into effect . She had asked her old governessto accompany her , and the two of them were descendingthe stairs to the front hall , when Mrs. deHaven accosted them and inquired where they were going . When Elsie said she was going to the opera , a scene ensued . How could she be so thoughtless of her father 's memory ! She was in mourning . An appearance at the opera was out of the ques- tion for at least a year . She dragged herself upstairs again and flung herself on her bed and wept . Mrs. deHaven had no inkling of the spiritual and emotionalexperience Elsie had had in Paris , and would have been inexpressibly shocked had she been told about it . At any word or gesture from Elsie that suggested the slightest independence of thought or feeling , her mother put on a demonstration of outrage that repelled and sickened the girl . There was nobody to understand her . She spent days at a time pining and brooding over her brief happiness in Paris . The name @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything free and fair and beautiful in life . She would sit for hours in her room , slowly turning over the programs of the operas she had heard in Paris , relivingevery instant of the music and every throb of feeling she had derived from the sight and sound of Lena Geyer . Without the peculiar stimulus of her isolation and friendlessnessshe might never have reached the state of intensity that she did . But there was literally no other outlet in her whole existence for her dreams and yearnings and ideals . " It . is rather shocking to reflect , " she wrote me , " that my mother 's sudden death of pneumonia in the winter of 1905 set me free beyond my wildest dreams . When the first bewildermentwas past , and the family affairs came up for settlement , it appeared that my brother and I were the soleheirsto a very large fortune . My mother had died intestate , and my father had left most of his property to her for her lifetime , to be divided between Dyckman and me at her death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and the Tarrytownestate to Dyckman . The money was equally divided . I was twenty-one when this happened , but Dyckman seemed to take it for granted that he was my guardian and that he would arrange my life , provide a chaperone , and see to itP229that I continued in the way our parents had intended I should go . On an evening that I shall never forget , because it was the first time in my life that I asserted myself , I told him I had no idea of following any such plan . " He was at first incredulous and deprecating , and later when he saw that I was in earnest , very angry . He could not understand that there might be something I wanted to do . When he realized that there was something , and that I had the means with which to do it , he was furious . He was exactly like my father in his fixed idea that women had no function , right , or identity in life except through the authority of men . He expected me to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , and eventually either marrying or retiring into obscure spinsterhood when he should marry and his wife should take my place . I told him quietly and firmly that I was determined to have my way and to do what I wanted to . He asked me what I wanted to do , and I told him I was going to travel . Where ? ' he asked me . Anywherethat I have reason to go , ' I said . But I did not tell him my reason . " He raised all the conventional objections relating to women alone . I assured him I would take Nellie , my maid , but that was not satisfactory . I was still sufficiently under the habit of obedience to agree when he said I could not travel without a better chaperone than a maid . All I knew was that he could not prevent the bank from paying me my income , and that I could spend it as I pleased . After a certain point in the argument , like most stubborn people , Dyckman lost interest and capitulated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do , ' he said , but I wish you would have enough respect for our parents ' memory not to disgrace them by wandering around the world all alone . ' " I agreed not to disgrace him or our parents in this way ,   and finally we decided that Mademoiselle Desvignes , my old governess , would make a suitable companion and chaperone . She was a well-bred French bourgeoise of extreme respectability , fifty-five years old , and entirely devoted to me . She had never left us because my father had had the fine oldfashionedidea that one never dismissed and forgot a worthy retainer . I asked her if she would care to live with me , spending most of her time travelling . Like all French people she had a sound respect for money , and I gave her to understand that I was now in possession of enough money to do exactly as I pleased , , and that her only function would be to placate the conventions by being my ' chaperone . ' She was of course enchanted , particularly when I told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So in April , 1905 , two years after my first trip abroad under such different circumstances , Mademoiselle and I , accompanied by Nellie , sailed for Europe . Dyckman saw us off on the boat , and in parting asked me when would I be back . ' I have no idea , ' I said , which caused him to leave in a bad temper . I had no idea but one : I was going straight to wherever Lena Geyer was singing , and I proposed to be wherever she was singing , for how long I did not know . " We reached Paris toward the end of April , and I soon found myself grateful to my brother for insisting that I take Mademoiselle . I had not stopped to think how ignorant I - was of everything in the world outside the narrow sphere I had always known . I left all travel arrangements , finances , and dealings with clerks and hotel keepers to Mademoiselle , who was in her element among them . We always had beautifulrooms and the best of everything , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to save the extra francs and centimes . I learned a good deal from watching her , little realizing that one day I would be doing theP231same thing for Lena Geyer . At this time I was too intent on the present ever to think of the future . " While Mademoiselle settled us in a suite at the hotel , I pored over the opera schedules I had sent for before even taking off my hat . Madame Geyer was to ' sing the followingnight in Lohengrin , and twice weekly until the middle of May , when I knew she was booked for Covent Garden . I told Mademoiselle to enjoy her Paris as fully as she could because we would be leaving for London in three weeks , at which she drew a disgusted face . I had worried ever since leaving New York about what to do with her while I went to the opera . I did not want her with me . I wanted to be alone , not only because it suited my mood , but because I wanted to be free of people who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mademoiselle , I knew , would think of it in no other way . So I was enormously relievedwhen she shook her head at the sight of my sheaf of handbills and murmured Quelle horreur ! ' " I asked her if she disliked opera . She said she did , very much , and I told her she need never go . She looked worried and asked me what was to become of me . I told her I wished to go alone . She protested with typical gestures of consternationand said it was incroyable , no lady could go to the opera alone . We discussed the problem for a long time . Even today it would be a problem ; Paris is no place for a woman to go anywhere alone , and certainly not to the opera . I think I would never have had the courage to begin such a habit if I had not felt fortified by my own plainness . It was unthinkable that anyone would accost or annoy a young woman who looked like me . Another reason why I wanted to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the elaborate toilettes one wore in them . I went to see the Comtesse de Rancelles and told her how I felt . I had rightlyp232guessed that a woman of such intelligence and individuality would be interested and sympathetic toward someone as odd as I. I was no longer her responsibility ; I was independent and if I wanted to be unconventional she was willing to help me do as I pleased without making myself conspicuous . " She took me to Premet 's where we ordered two black dresses , cut exactly alike and extremely severe , with high necks and long sleeves . One was made of velvet , the other of a sheer silk , and they were so elegantly cut and finished that they were evening dresses in everything except decolletage . For the first time I felt comfortable . In such clothes I could sit by myself in a stall and be happy in my own way . Mademoiselle would accompany me to the Opera in a carriage , escort me to the door , and leave me there . She would go off to spend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would be waiting for me at the side door when the opera was over . " Thus I began to live according to my ideas . At LohengrinI was so wrought up with the long starvation I had endured , and the suspense , that I could hardly breathe . I barely heard the dissertation between the King and Telramund . When the Herald stepped forward and summoned Elsa my heart began to pound wildly . At last she appeared , following the interminable train of maidens , and I stared at Lena Geyer as if I could never see enough of her face . I have never been so glad to see anything . I could not be gladder to see her today , if she walked into this garden . Her expression was gentle and demure , something that would almost be a smirk on some faces , but she made it so right for the character that it radiated sincerity . " Then she began to sing , and since there are no words to describe the joy that poured into my soul , I shall not look for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pouring intop233the throat of someone nearly dead of thirst . I was quite unnerved . But I was all alone in the dark seat , without white kid gloves , and armed with a good everyday handkerchief . I could let the tears flow . I had not heard Geyer 's Elsa before , and once more I was struck with the astonishing versatility of her voice . I think she could do anything with it . Here she gave it a clear , pure quality so different from that of her Carmen or her Aida as to lead you to suppose that it was an entirely different woman . Yet the same physical thrill was there , that thing that gripped me and made something inside me leap into my ears and throat . I would hesitate to describe some of the effects of her voice upon me , if I did not know that it affected most people in similar ways , you among them , I am sure . " She did the so-called Balcony Scene with a delicacy and a spirituality that were new revelations of her power . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I knew her well I used to try to identify the qualities of her operatic parts with her own character . It was difficult . She was less like Elsa than like any other part she played , but she put such intelligence into her portrayal that she could play the stupid goose ' without a suggestion of insipidity or simpering . Stupid goose ' was her own epithet for Elsa , and she never understood why people loved her in the part . Ah yes , a wonderful score , ' she used to say , they love all the tunes , and the deadly weddingmarch . But that stupid goose , so full of dreams ! ' " I suppose I would have been shocked if I had realized what was going on in the head of that enraptured creature on the stage . I let myself be carried away , frankly enjoying the sentimentality . Lohengrin was one of Jean deReszke 's greatest parts , and he did not waste an ounce of its meaning  --  if it could be said to have any meaning , Lena Geyer once @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hisp234mailed hand raised in warning , as he sang the ominous motif , Nie sollst Du midi befragen . ' " Geyer was to sing Donna Anna three days later , and duringthe day I passed a florist 's shop while walking on the Rue Saint-Honore . For some reason it had never occurred to me to send her flowers , probably because I had never sent them to anyone . There was a mass of yellow roses in the window , so arresting that I stopped to look at them . I thought of her and decided to send them . When the florist asked for my card , I started to tell him not to enclose a card . Then I had one of my most daring thoughts so far . If the hints I had overheard about the Duc de Chartres were true , she would undoubtedly take it for granted that any flowers without a card came from him . And I did not want her to think he had sent my roses . So I took a plain white card and wrote on it ' E. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I told the man as coolly as I could to send them to Madame Geyer at the Opera that evening . When I reached the hotel I was aghast at what I had done . " There is no use giving you the lengthy details of my life for the next two years . It was always the same . Wherever Lena Geyer was engaged to sing , Mademoiselle and I , with Nellie , were established in a comfortable hotel . Mademoiselle had long ago outgrown her disapproval of my eccentricity . She loved to travel and the only times she grumbled were when we were in London . Like many French people she loathed it . When I told her , in February 1907 , that we were going to St. Petersburg , she did not turn a hair . But I knew she was terrified . She thought of Russia as a wilderness full of ferocious Cossacks slashing down defenselesspeople in the streets . She was so sporting about it that I took her out the first day we were there and bought her a beautiful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Germany , and Scandinavia . When Lena Geyer broke with the Vienna Hofoper and started out on her big tour of Europe that year , I was greatly excited by the prospect of all the extra travelling . Yet everywheremy life was the same . I have always been a creature of order and routine and I settled down comfortably in each new city , completely contented so long as I had my Geyer to listen to . On her first appearance everywhere I sent her a huge box of yellow roses , and smaller bouquets of violets or camellias for every performance . When we reached London that spring , the flowers were particularly beautiful and I took special pleasure in selecting them . Not until long after it had actually happened could I realize that at last I knew my idol and dream , and that henceforward my life was going to be very different . Yet in all the years I lived with her , I never took her so much for granted that I failed to send flowers to her dressing room for every performance . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wasthe greatest possible contrast to the romantic one of the five preceding years . Instead of the duke to watch over her she had Elsie deHaven . Instead of the ubiquitous Pierre as major-domo to superintend travelling and domestic arrangements , she had Elsie 's prim and correct Mademoiselle . Insteadof the French and Austrian retinue provided by the duke , the household consisted of her own Dora , somewhat less surly in this gynaecium than she had been in the previous circumstances , of which she had always disapproved ; Elsie deHaven 's New York-Irish maid , Nellie ; and a cook from Brunn , brought to the doorstep by Dora one morning with the calm announcement that she was the best cook in Europe . To everyone 's surprise Anna proved to be worthy of this estimate , and she lived with Lena Geyer on and off for twenty-seven years . When headquarters were maintained in hotels without a permanent household , she would get a job either in New York or Europe . But when summoned by Dora she would leave whatever kitchen she happened to be working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her employer with a laconic " I go now , " disappear , leaving her fabulous Mandelkuchen to burn in the oven or her goulash to simmer away on the stove . Thus , whenever Geyer arrived at a new house she always found the table set , the hall fragrantwith tantalizing odors , and Anna in calm possession of the kitchen range . Since I still enjoy Anna 's cooking at WhitePlains every Sunday , even though she is seventy years old , it P237is no nostalgic memory that makes me say her fried chicken , her potted pigeons , and her roast goose are culinary poems . As for her Bohemian plum dumplings , boiled with blue plums inside and served with melted butter and poppy seeds  --  or her sorrel soup  --  no words could praise them enough . And her coffee is surely the best in the world . In Salzburg Lena and Elsie deHaven began their lifetime of association by sharing a house , which they rented for the summer . It was a small cottage about three miles outside of town , on the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time with Lilli Lehmann , Lena practising , working on two new roles , and taking long walks in the mountains . At first Elsie could not believe that life was real . Three months before e had been the black-clad mouse of the sixth-row stall , living only in the sound of Geyer 's voice . Now she was Geyer 's hourly companion , no longer in black  --  a woman familiar with a whole new vernacular and capable of asserting herself . " I can not imagine what Lena saw in me , " she wrote . " We will have to let it go as the same sort of mystery that holds a forceful , handsome , desirable man to a homely little shadow of a wife . I know my love for her gave her something she had never had before . I asked nothing of her except that she be her best self in certain ways , as in the Chartres incident . But every strong character who lives in great activity , in spectacularcontact with the world takes comfort in the knowledge that there is deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she relied on me . Even after she married Henry Loeffler , who was everything a fine man could be , she clung to me for something she evidently found nowhere else . " " We shared all expenses , " Miss deHaven wrote of that first summer together . " There was a great deal about her 3 8 early life that Lena never told me and that I gathered from other sources , but I knew how hard she had struggled over money . It seemed impossible to me that anyone could value a five-cent piece as Lena said she used to ; that one should he forced to choose between a street-car fare and something extra for dinner . As soon as Lena began to make money she showed all the characteristics you would expect of someone of her background and experience . She was close with money  --  there is no use mincing the matter . Where I had been taught to watch my pennies and carefully consider the price of everything because extravagance was vulgar , Lena did so out of an exaggerated sense of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dressmaker over the cost of a roll of soutache braid , and try to make her throw it in for nothing . She always expected special rates from hotels , steamship companies , modistes , hairdressers , everyone who sold her things , and she got them . I had learned some tricks of paring hotel and travelling expenses from Mademoiselle , but they were amateurish compared with Lena 's methods . " She also had the characteristic impulsive generosity that goes with closeness . She was always very generous with tips , more so than I would ever have been . She demanded more service than most people , but the bellhops and hotel maids were so delighted to find themselves waiting on the great Madame Geyer that they hardly expected tips as large as they received . She was particularly open-handed with waiters , like all people who love to eat . " My first instinct with Lena was to pay for anything she wanted , because I loved her and had nothing else to do with my money . But I soon realized that paying for more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mistake . Now and then I saw traces of stinginess in her that shocked me , and right at the beginning something happenedp239that made me think . I had bought the tickets from London to Salzburg for our party of five , and paid the excess charges on our vanload of baggage . This came to quite a large sum of money . Then I had bought foreign currency at my Londonbank , which Lena i her crazy haste had not thought to do , and as we reached each frontier I was the only one in the party who had guilders , marks , and crowns . So I paid for everything . I supposed that Lena would ask me what her share of all this had been , but she did not . After we had been in Salzburg two or three weeks , I made up an account of what she owed me for her fare and Dora 's , and all her other expenses . I handed it to her casually one morning when I was helping her to answer letters , and told her what it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughly unguarded surprise . I looked at her without flinching , though I suppose I blushed furiously when I caught her reaction  --  blushing was a weakness of mine when I was young . Nevertheless I stuck to my gun of silence . When she realized what I was thinking , it was her turn to blush . She grew scarlet . Neither of us said a word . She reached for her checkbook and drew a check on London which she handed me without looking up from the desk . I felt like a wastrel son who had asked his father to pay his debts . The check burned my fingers . Yet I knew I was right ; her attitude had proved it . " Next day she sat back in her chair after breakfast and said she had been thinking how we ought to arrange our finances while we were living together . She said she knew nothing about accounts , all she could do was keep track of her pocket money because that was the kind of sum she had been used to . You be the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything we spend and put my initials beside every bit of it that belongs to me . Then add it all up once a week and I 'll pay my share . Will you ? ' I said I would . After thatp240all our financial affairs went through my hands . Lena never knew the details . Once in a while if she suspected that I had been easy and paid too much for a hotel suite or a dry-cleaner , she would investigate . She irritated me when she did that . Sometimes she would come to me triumphantlyand say Look ! I made him take fourteen marks off the bill ! ' I never got used to this , but there was no use quarrelling with her about it . The system had not been in operation a fortnight before I knew it was the only thing to have done with Lena . If I had paid any of her expenses , even temporarily , she would have drifted into an attitude of expectingit . The inevitable consequence of her using my money would have been using me for my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . As it was , she had more than respect for me in financial matters ; she was afraid of me . This was good for her . It put a kind of backbone into our relationship . I also know that I would ultimately have felt contempt for her if I had not made her pay her own way . In those days her earnings were considerably less than my income . Gradually they increased , until at the end of ten years she was making two or three times my income at the peak of her career . She could then have paid my expenses , and once even suggested it , but I never allowed her to . " In those days Salzburg was utterly different from today . The Mozart Festival was really a personal labor of love on the part of Lilli Lehmann and the artists she invited to appear with her . Only Mozart operas were given , with the orchestra , chorus , and settings that the Emperor sent from the Hofoper in Vienna . After Lena left the Hofoper she was reluctant to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lehmann prevailed on her to do so , and the performanceswere wonderful . The modern Salzburg Festival is also wonderful , and I love to go there ; somehow I missP241Lena less painfully when I am there . But in the old days , there were no huge international crowds , no automobiles , no uproars over tickets , and no celebrity-chasing . As a matter of fact the little town was given over so exclusively to celebrities that they outnumbered the public that came to hear them . " Frau Lehmann lived in a charming Landhaus at **25;3816;TOOLONG , but spent much of her time in Salzburg . We used to have wonderful days all together , climbing the mountains , rowing on the lakes , and eating delicious things out of enormous picnic baskets . It seems to me we were always eating . Lena and I hired a gig with an old gray horse , and I used to drive her everywhere . I can still see the picture we made , sitting up on top of the high yellow wheels in our full madras dresses and our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her hat and her high ruffled collar , Lena 's face used to shine like a full moon . She loved driving , though she was afraid to take the reins herself , and thought it very brave of me to have learned as a child in Tarrytown . " Frau Lehmann evidently approved of me as a friend for Lena , for she was always very cordial and jolly . She used to meet us at her front gate , dressed in a Dirndl with a fringed kerchief and a flowered apron , with Baby , her dachshund , at her heels . Eventually Baby suffered from a goitre and was nursed with the most extravagant care an animal ever received , I am sure . If Lena contradicted all my preconceived ideas of a prima donna , Lilli Lehmann flabbergasted me . She was unquestionably the greatest singer then alive , and one of the greatest of all time . Yet you could hardly have found , except in the marvellous animation of her face and the brillianceof her eyes , a difference between her and any other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke of music with absolute authority , but simply and naturally . I used to sit in an adjoining room sometimes while she worked with Lena , and when listening to Lehmann I was awe-struck by the splendor of her conceptions and the standardsshe expected Lena to meet . I had thought Lena the ultimate in singing until I heard her teacher . Then only did I realize how much work still lay ahead . " One day Lena asked Frau Lehmann a question about a phrase in the Contessa 's part in the Letter Duet . " Let us do it together , ' Frau Lehmann said , and you will see how I make it with the second voice . You are Susanna . ' " She sat down at the piano and Lena stood behind her . I crept to the doorway and listened behind a curtain . That moment stands alone in my experience . I have heard more thrilling and more exciting music , but for sheer beauty that singing was unique . The voices were inspired . Frau Lehmannwas then fifty-nine years old and her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fluent and indescribably expressive . It had no reediness , no hollow spots . Lena 's sounded brilliantagainst it . I was deeply moved by the sight of the two women and the significance of their relationship . Nobody could be said to have been strictly Lilli Lehmann 's successor , but she did truly hand her sceptre down to Lena Geyer . " The two new-found friends lived five or six weeks of this idyllic life , but toward the end of August , Lena was galvanizedby a new development  --  one for which she had been waiting for many years . The representative of the MetropolitanOpera came to Salzburg to see her . Heinrich Conried , who had succeeded Maurice Grau as general manager , wanted to engage her for the coming season , and Lena was ready to accept . When Maurice Grau was forced by ill health to give up the Metropolitan in 1903 , he told ConriedP243that there was a young woman in Europe named Lena Geyer who would soon be one of his greatest stars ; and Grau verified his own opinion by hearing her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the departure of Grau the amazing era of his management came to an end , and though Conned retained many of his best artists , and engagedmore like Caruso , Chaliapin , Fremstad , Gadski , Farrar , and Geyer , nothing like Grau 's casts has been heard anywhere since . Grau had grown rich producing this kind of opera , but Conned lost money , even with his roster of magnificentsingers , and it was not until the following year , when Gatti-Casazza took hold , that the Metropolitan entered upon its second  --  and probably last  --  era of glory and prosperity . Frau Lehmann advised Lena to demand a higher fee than Conned had offered , and this was finally set at $i , 000 for each appearance . She contracted to sing eight roles  --  Donna Anna , Leonora in Trovatore , Aida , Elisabeth , Sieglinde , Elsa , Eva , and Fidelio . At a glance anyone who remembers his operatic history can put two and two together  --  Gustav Mahler had also been engaged for the Metropolitan and clearly stipulated what roles he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guest contracts in Stockholm and Munich for October and November that she could not break , so she was to leave for New York after fulfilling them . When Conried 's representative came with the Metropolitan contract for her to sign , he looked at her curiously while she was reading it . Her face was full of mischief and her green eyes were dancing . " Is it true , Madame Geyer , " he asked suddenly , " that you are the Lena Geyer who sang at the Metropolitan once before ? " Lena was a tease , and once in a while she used to act like a traditional stage prima donna , grandiose and posing , when she wanted to make somebody feel like a fool . She had been very haughty with the Metropolitan agent and had spoken to him only in German . Two or three times she even interpolatedsome English word in a strong accent , which nearly floored Miss deHaven . When this man asked her about the Metropolitan , the corners of her mouth twitched . She looked up from the contract @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schindler , " she exclaimed in perfectly matterof-factEnglish , " do n't you ever look at your old programs ? " She signed the contract in her bold , slanting hand , and as she did so exclaimed , " There ! That 's how I got this name , signing a Metropolitan contract ! " Immediately after the agent left she sent a cable to : Maestro Pizzetti , which read : DARLING MAESTRO COMINGHOME DECEMBER DEBUT MET WORKING HARD BLESS YOU LENA . From then until they sailed from Bremen in December , Lena was so excited that there was no keeping up with her . Her life had compassed so many revolutions in such a short time that it would have been a wonder if she were not nervous and on edge . Everything had come to a head all at once . After years of building toward her most precious ideal , coming back in triumph to New York to vindicate all her hardships , she could hardly realize that her aim had been achieved . People told her she was a fool to think as she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she would regret the rest of her days . America knew nothing of music , the opera was trash compared with Vienna or Berlin , and New York was barbarous . But both Lilli Lehmann and Lena knew better ; nor did Lena bother to tell any of her critics that she already knew New York and the opera , the stores and the streets and the slums , the public charities and private tragedies , the noise and force and color , and the coldP245clear air for which she used to say sometimes , in Europe , that she was suffocating . She went through her final performancesin Munich and Stockholm in a daze . Her eyes seemed always fixed on something far ahead and far away . Every night that she was not singing she went to bed at half-past seven , with a score and a pencil , and sat up against the pillows slowly mouthing her texts and studying them like a fanatic  --  just as if she had not been singing them before the crowned heads of Europe for five years . It was about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Miss deHaven had picked up the score of Lohengrin , which Lena had left on her bedroom floor , and when Lena wanted it again she could not find it . She was irritated and she dumped all her music and scores out of their racks in a pile in the middle of the floor . She kept tip a running comment of curses  --  " Damn that dumnie Gans , I did n't want to study it anyway . " " What dumnie Gans ? " Miss deHaven asked with her head in a bureau drawer . " That verfluchte Elsa , " Lena scowled . " Such a fool , with those dreams . Just like you . " Suddenly she sat back on her heels and forgot her temper . " Ach ! " she cried , " What a wonderful discovery ! Darling little duinme Gans ! " She rushed over and hugged her friend . " The only sense that creature ever made , " she cried . " She gave me a name for you . Hurrah !  --  dummne Gans  --  Elsa deHaven " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elsa by the elbows and marched her smartly around the room .   " RETURNING to New York was a profound experience for both of us , " Miss deHaven wrote . " There never seemed to be any question that I would go with Lena . Once I made some suggestion as if we were not going together and she looked at me with amazement . She never definitely said she expected me to live with her permanently . It was always a casual arrangement , like our menage at Salzburg , yet we both knew we were settled together . Mademoiselle forestalledthe question of her becoming a problem by telling me , late in the fall of 1907 , that she saw that her usefulness to me was over and that she was growing too old for any more traipsing about the world . I assured her I did not think so , but we were both relieved to have our arrangement terminatedin such a natural way . She wanted to go back to Paris and settle down ; I provided for her amply , and she lived there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the rest of her life . She lived to be nearly eighty . " You can hardly realize what inner revolutions the prospect of America caused both in Lena and in me . She was returning in triumph to the scene of her former poverty and obscurity ; I , having left there to worship her from a distance , was returning as her closest friend and companion . And I was entering a world stranger than if I had gone to China , for the New York of my family and the New York of Lena 's career were two cities as remote as the poles . Incredibleas it may seem , I had never been in a hotel in New York . When we began to plan our living arrangements I P247realized that it had never occurred to me that we would not go to my house . But when I mentioned i+ +o Lena she shook her head . " Darling , that would be impossible , ' she said . We must go to a hotel . When I am singing I have to live my own way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if I please . No ordinary household can stand that sort of strain . Your servants would leave . I would not feel like myself in a house . A holiday like Salzburg is all right . But I am not domestic  --  I do n't like the cramped feeling . A hotel is the place for a barbarian like me . ' " I knew she was right , especially when I remembered what my house was like , full of black walnut and horsehair and red velvet and marble table-tops . I could not picture Lena in that setting . At the same time I became suddenly curious about my house . I had not thought of it since my flight in 1905 . I wrote Dyckman and inquired . The previous spring he had married Mary Van Sinderen , a girl with whom I had gone to school , who was just the person my parents would have selected for him . She and I have not spent half an hour together in twenty-five years . Dyckman and Mary were planning to live in the house that winter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hear from me about it . His answer to my inquiry was so ill-natured that Lena  --  we always talked over such things together  --  snapped with vindictiveness . At her instigation I wrote Dyckman that I had no objection to his using the house but I saw no reason why he should not pay me rent for it . His reply contained a check for six months ' rent and the observation that since I was planning to return with my opera-singer friend , who would doubtless not care to meet him , he would not intrude upon her by meeting our boat . " But Lena 's Maestro did meet it . As we came alongsideP248the pier she stood at the forward rail , peering down into the crowd . Suddenly , before I could stop her , she let out the full force of her powerful lungs in an ecstatic cry  --  ' Maestro ! ' Brunnhilde never made a more stirring ejaculation . " Out in the snow on the end of the pier I saw a bearded man in a black slouch hat and a long @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holding out his arms to her . I thought she would have a fit of nerves before the ship was tied up and we were off . At the bottom of the gangplank she rushed into his arms and they stood there regardless of the crowd and confusion , with tears running down their cheeks , embracing and kissing , then holding each other at arm 's length and looking into each other 's faces , and then hugging and kissing again . I was dreadfully embarrassed by such a demonstration in public , and hurried off to help Dora round up the luggage , but they were absolutely oblivious . Two children of nature , in one of the big moments of their lives . " I was rather upset myself . It was only natural that Lena should overlook me in the excitement of meeting her Maestro , and I did not mind that . But it was the first of a thousandinstances in which some big emotion swept her past me into a superworld of her own , comparable only to her hours on the stage . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off from every other soul and contact in the world . My brother was the last person on earth I cared to see , but the fact that he had ignored me at a moment when she too must ignore me left me desperately lonely and forlorn . I saw then that giving up my life to Lena was not all joy and happiness . I was destined for many disillusioning hours , **26;3843;TOOLONG to someone who was shy and proud . " Dora and Nellie had their hands full with the customs , P249though Maestro Pizzetti had had the forethought to bring someone along with him who facilitated the complicated matter of declaring Lena 's costumes in bond . Maestro himself had no idea of what was going on , and stood by clinging to Lena 's arm and talking so fast that my head whirled . The harder and faster they talked the more impossible it was to make sense with the customs inspector . I turned to Lena and told her to go on ahead to the hotel in a cab with the Maestro  --  I would follow when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had not even introduced us . She overwhelmed me with apologies and told us that we were her two best and only friends in the world , we must love each other  --  and seizing us each by the elbow shoved us into each other 's arms . I was crimson with embarrassment . The Maestro beamed and nodded and said Grazie , grazie , ' over and over , nobody knew exactly for what . " At last we were all collected and disposed at the Plaza . We went there quite casually , just because the manager of the Bristol in Berlin had told Lena she would like it . As it turned out , she lived there on and off all her life . That evening , the Maestro told us , he and Luisa ( his wife ) were expecting us to dinner . I tried to beg off , feeling that I had no place in this reunion , but Lena was suddenly as conscious of my isolation as she had been oblivious that morning . She insisted that I come . " Pizzetti @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's departure for Germany that for the first time the idea of marriage had occurred to him . He had made a happy match with the niece of Lena 's benefactor , Antonio Lucarelli . The Maestro could not be said to be in love with his wife in our romantic American sense , but it was a good , comfortable marriage that gave him two children and a pleasant home.  | All his tenderer feelings and his idealization of the things he treasured were centred in Lena . " I had never seen anything like the Pizzetti household . They lived in a high-stooped house in West Seventy-eighth Street , near Central Park , which Uncle Lucarelli had given them for a wedding present . The good old gentleman had died some years before , but we were met on the doorstep by his namesake , little Antonio , a wildly excited dark-eyed boy of seven , bouncing up and down on the threshold with his five-year-old sister . Behind them stood Luisa , a beaming , plump-faced Italian woman with full bosom and broad hips , whom Lena had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ kiss . Little Antonio seized Lena 's hat and furs and ran to hang them up , shouting and screaming through the hall . Luisa took my wraps , shrugging in a helpless way about the noise . I was bewildered , and I retreated to a corner of the sitting room where I watched the Pizzettis celebrate . We had dinner downstairs in the basement dining room , and when Luisa uncovered an enormous tureen of steaming spaghetti , Lena leaned over it , inhaling its savor with her eyes closed . Then she rushed to Maestro and threw her arms around his neck . You made it ! ' she cried . Grazie , grazie , carissimo inio ! ' She ate it like someone half-crazed with hunger . Then Luisa brought in chicken cacciatora , and a couple of vegetables I had never tasted before , and we had Italian bread and Chianti . Then there was a huge wooden bowl of salad , a marvellous cheese , and coffee and Italian brandy that Maestro said he had saved since the night Lena had sung for Grau and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fell as he lifted his glass and looked at her . I have never seen a more exquisite quality of love in human eyes . Luisa and I stole a glance at each other ; we were both deeply moved . But Lena suddenly rose from her chair andP251stood beside him for a moment ; then she crumpled down on her knees and buried her head in his lap , with her arms around him . " The whole scene was a thing of awe and intense sentiment . A new Lena was revealed , someone I never dreamed of ; a child , humble , and passionate with gratitude , and absolutelyunashamed to show it . To me , with a background in which frozen propriety was the only standard of behavior , it was overwhelming . Anything less sincere would have been rather horrible , for uncontrolled emotions always make me flinch . In this woman of thirty-two , whom I had first seen as the queen of her world , the awkward and struggling girl of crude peasant birth was completely revealed to me for the first time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her origin . " Lena 's joy of reunion with her Maestro was repeated in a less passionate measure at her meeting with Gustav Mahler . She had planned to go down to the Opera the first morning after our arrival , and see him there , but as we stepped into the elevator at the Plaza , when we returned from the Pizzettis ' that first night , she let out a cry of delight and threw her arms around the neck of a short , homely , spectacled man who was standing in the car . It was Mahler . " In one breath they asked each other , What are you doing here ? ' and each answered I live here ! ' They spoke German , so excitedly and so fast that I could not follow what they were saying , and when I went to bed they were still in Lena 's drawing room , drinking hot milk and exchanging all the experiences that had intervened since their parting the year before in Vienna . After her dramatic support of him in the crisis it may @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was always hard for me to understand why he was considered so disagreeable and quarrelsome . While I was still in the room I heard him ask her about the Duc de Chartres , and she answered with a gesture  --  a very sweet one  --  of regret and resignation and finality . He nodded wisely and , I thought , approvingly . " The days flew by as she prepared for her debut at the Metropolitan . She came back from her first rehearsal bubbling with talk . A few people at the opera house remembered her , or thought they did ; Ceccarini had died two years ago , and Herrmann had gone to South America , but some of the chorus and supers knew her . In her attitude toward them she was nothing short of magnificent , though it would have been within the pettier elements of her character to have pretended not to remember them . Some things about her past she definitely denied or feigned to forget . Perhaps some people would call that small , but one must know a selfmadeperson very intimately @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him for such an attitude . " " Lena was to make her Metropolitan debut as Donna Anna in Don Giovanni . Mahler selected it for her in preference to a Wagnerian role as there were already in the company two splendid new Wagner singers , Olive Fremstad and Johanna Gadski . Lena was a finer voice and a more versatile singer than either of them , and he wanted to display her more unique accomplishments  --  Mozart and Beethoven . The memory of that Don Giovanni cast makes my blood tingle to this day . It was : Geyer ( Donna Anna ) , Emma Eames ( Donna Elvira ) , Marcella Sembrich ( Zerlina ) , Scotti ( Don Giovanni ) , Alessandro Bonci ( Don Ottavio ) and Chaliapin ( Leporello )  --  the latter an impersonation nobody could forget . The whole setting glowed with their refulgence and with the powerful inspiration of Mahler in the pit . LenaP253did not make this debut as an unknown ; she already had a great European reputation and most music lovers knew her name . Many of them had heard her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York public she was new . The judgment they rendered that night never wavered for the nineteen years of her American career . " As the magnificently played overture ended , and the curtainsparted on Chaliapin , I realized that we were in for a remarkable performance . He sang his Notte e giorno with the most wicked insinuation and devilish grimaces , then crouched at the side , and my heart rose straight into my throat as Lena , struggling with Scotti , appeared on the steps at the left . Twenty minutes before she had sworn to me that she was not nervous , but I had seen a pulse in her temple twitching and felt her hand like cold wax as I kissed it . I always kissed her hand before performances on account of the make-up on her face . Maestro and Herr Mahler had both stopped in her dressing room to give their blessings , and there had met for the first time . The three had exchanged mutual looks of admiration and resolution that would have inspired anyone . " All this was travelling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and that I was so wrought up I had actually not heard her . I sat up with a start . She did this opening scene of the opera with finesse , imagination , and musicianship completely beyond other singers , and made it pitifully real where many only make it ridiculous . Her voice was its very best . She was singing with all the technical perfectionthat Maestro and Lilli Lehmann combined could have desired , but beyond that she had in fullest measure that electrical thrill , that utterly physical surge which used to make us all helpless with emotion . As she and Scotti , who was then in his brilliant youth , finished the duet , there was deafening applause . I listened in a daze to Eames singing Aht chi mi dice mail ' which is difficult in that its angry emotiontends to make any woman shrewish , and it did her . In that trio Scotti and Chaliapin were two romping devils , and then the great Pussian sang his Catalogo aria in inimitable style . Sembrich came next , in what many think was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as by her Zerlina that night . I believe those critics who say that no singer ever matched the absolute perfection of her style . " But I was too intent on Lena to pay thorough attention to anyone else . The great moment came at last , when she began the passionate recitative about her father 's murder . Then I do not remember breathing again , for she launched ( with such fabulous accompaniment from Mahler ! ) into Or sai chi l'onore , with an attack that made me hot and cold with excitement as I listened . I think there is no more dramatic aria in music , and Lena not only extracted every drop of its vengeful meaning , but added to it the indescribablequality of her own passions . People around me were literally gasping as she sang ; I know she had never thrilled an audience like that before . The situation had excited her to the highest possible peak and she outdid herself in every way , but you must remember that she never sacrificed one particle of her technique . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it unfalteringly , as on a foundation . " The way she sang those A 's rings in my ears to this day . When she finished , the applause started with a sudden terrificimpact more shouting than handclapping . There have been other ovations like that one and you remember some of them , but nobody hears very many in a lifetime . If Lena had made that debut as Elsa , for instance , the excitement would not have been the same . She keyed the whole evening with her tremendous conception of Donna Anna and the electricalP255force of her singing . When I went back after the first act , just after the big concerted finale outside Don Giovanni 's palace , she was standing in her dressing room struggling to reach a broken garter . I broke the damn thing curtseying ! ' she whispered . I ignored the garter and tried to tell her what it was like out inn front She shook her head impatiently . She was extremely excited but noticed only her garter . You never sang like that before , Lena , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' she snapped , but for God 's sake fix my garter ! ' Dora approached at this moment with a threaded needle , frowning more than usual . Inwardly she must have been in a turmoil like me  --  she had heard the singing from the wings . But she only drew down the corners of her mouth and said somethingbrusquely in Czech . Lena turned quiet at once . " She lay down on her side on the couch , with her skirts pulled up and her back turned to Dora , so she could sew the garter , and that was how Conried found her when he burst in to exult about her singing ! " In the second act she was just as magnificent . When she stood alone before her father 's portrait in the chapel and began to sing Non mi dir bel'idol mio I could not keep from weeping . The peculiarity of this aria is that its piano beginningseems to shut many singers up so that they turn reedy in its beautiful opening phrase . Lena 's pianissimo as every one knows had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as round as her biggest full notes , but softened by such phenomenal control that I never grew used to the wonder of it . Her audience was as stirred by it as by the dramatic fire of her first aria , and during the coloratura section at the end they were all on edge . I thought of Maestro Pizzetti , who was responsible for that part of her training , and how happy he must be . She finished in the noblest breadth of classic style . The applause was even wilder than after the first act .   " Lena had somehow not thought what the rush to her dressing room would be like , or how much bolder New Yorkers are than Europeans . By the time I had made my way across the stage there was a crowd in the narrow hallway all trying to get in . The room was already filled with people . Lena was sitting in the corner surrounded by an excited ring of jabbering strangers , trying to smile and be polite , but inwardly , I could see , terrified @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look . I was too timid to tell any of these people to leave . I felt helpless , but just then I saw Maestro Pizzetti in the doorway . He knew many of the people and stood not the least in awe of the rest , so in a few moments he had cleared the room , and we were left alone , we three with Dora . She was standing in the corner , frowningas usual , impatiently waiting to undress her mistress . Lena jumped up , seized her by the shoulders and shouted Dunnmko p f ! How do you like America ? ' " Dora shrugged and said something in Czech . She had got Lena partly undressed , very shocked because Lena was so busy going over the performance with the Maestro that she refused to go behind the screen to take her clothes off , when there was a loud knock on the door . Looking out , I saw Mahler and admitted him . Dora reached for a peignoir , but Lena leaped , half-naked , to the door , and seized Mahler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ helplessly from him to Maestro Pizzetti . There was much excited discussion of the performance , Maestro being nearly beside himself , for he had never heard such conducting . Wait , ' Mahler said . Wait a few weeks until we give Fidelio and then you will have something to be proud of . ' He motioned toward Lena . She was hastily putting on her old red velvet robe and her carriage boots , but when Dora looked for the woolen cloak , hanging on its peg , it was not there . Signalling her to beP257quiet , I slipped behind Lena and put over her shoulders a new cloak of mink , lined with crimson velvet , with a full shirred hood of the fur . When she felt it in place of her own cloak she whirled round and seized me . She was too overcome to say anything , and flinging Out one side of the cloak she caught me inside it and we all ran out to the carriage . In the street the waiting crowd began to shout the moment Lena appeared on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the pavement . Lena was carrying an armful of my yellow roses and they were torn away from her before she realized it . All four of us squeezed into the carriage and drove to the Plaza . I 'm so hungry , ' Lena exclaimed on the way there , I could eat a horse . ' But when the supper actually came , and Herr Mahler rose to drink her health , she could not answer . She looked at us for a moment with her eyes full of tears , and said , I 'm frightened . Nobody deserves to have so much . ' "   " IN MY BUSINESS , " George Phillips said , indicating with his finger that that would be enough seltzer , " we used to hear of all the big European artists before they were brought to this country . Usually they came here as opera singers at the Met , then if they caught on with the public we concert managerswould try to sign ' em up for ourselves and send ' em out on tour . It 's still @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the concert business has got decrepit in its old age . Geyer was the last of the giants , you might say , the last of the three-thousand-dollar guarantee girls . Managing her was no cinch , but it brought in the dough . " We were sitting at our usual table in what had formerly been a speakeasy on West Fifty-sixth Street , a rendezvous for managers , publicity men , music critics , and other freaks who depended for their livelihood upon the doings over at Carnegie Hall . We had between us the usual dirty tablecloth , acrid ash-tray , and blue seltzer bottle . We had dined on the usual antipasti , spaghetti , and meat balls , and it was now ten o'clock and we had reached the whiskey-and-soda stage . It had taken a long time to get George warmed up to the subject of this book . Indeed , one might say that it had taken years . I had met him first in I920 when I was a Senior at Columbia and was arranging an undergraduate concert series . For some reason @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and sometimes he used to send me tickets to his artists ' recitals , or even take me out for a drink afterward and ask me what I thought about the concert . Of course this wasp259long before I had any idea of writing a book about Lena Geyer ; but he soon discovered that I worshipped her , and I think our respective feelings about her , so different in manifestationbut so alike at heart , constituted the real basis of our friendship . George is what you mean when you call somebody a " card . " He is small and skinny and wrinkled , with a thin layer of hair combed over his bald spot and a cigar perpetuallyspilling ashes down his vest . For me , at any rate , he has always typified the American male , I suppose because his exterior is so hard-boiled , while at the same time he is soft to the point of sentimentality inside . There are two highlights on his character  --  a sense of humor that I have never seen daunted , and a shrewdness that figuratively takes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has very little education yet he can circulate among the most cultivated people with perfect ease . In a sense he knows far less about singing than I do , but in a more practical way lie knows more than I can ever hope to learn . Though he speaks no language other than his own uncouth American , and though he ridiculesforeigners like a schoolboy , he can walk unabashed into a gathering of singers and virtuosi , no matter of what nationality , and come away with some contract that the more refined managers have tried to get for years . I do not know how he does it , and I have never met anyone ( including Lena herself ) who could tell me . He is the most profane man I have ever known , but his profanity is not particularly imaginative or colorful . He does not make a specialty of bad words , he merely repeats the same ones over and over again . " Bastard " is his usual term for a man ; if he likes the man he will call him a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lousy bastard . No singer is just a singer , she is a God-damn singer . Everything he wants is either in hell or in Christ , and when he does not approve of something he says " nuts . " Lena Geyer was amused by his vernacular and even adopted some of his slang ; but Miss deHaven was at first inexpressibly shocked , and I do not think she ever quite got used to having George around . They were poles apart . Yet each had salt in his nature , and each recognized it in the other . George is nobody 's yes-man , and even after Geyer told him that she wanted him to help me put this book together , he insisted that the idea was , in his words , hooey . " What d' you want to write a lot of God-damn bunk about Lena for ? " he would say . " There 's never been a sensible book about an opera singer and the reason is it ca n't be done . You 'll get bogged down in stinking sentimentality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ movie queen out of Lena instead of a singer . " The idea tickled him and he sat chucklingover it and wagging his wizened head . " Jeez , " he said . " Geyer on a Hollywood set ! " It was a year or so before I got my idea of the book through his head . I was not going to romanticize Lena , and I kept telling him so . I was not going to twist anything around to make it come out right in the end , and I wanted as many documents as I could get . I intended , I told him , to put Lena on paper as a singer , to show her artistic and personalproblems , to trace the whole varied course of her life from its hard-bitten origins to the full splendour of her later years , and tell how and why that miracle was accomplished . He was impressed by this , but he was not convinced , and in the end he was won over by one of those simple , human things that occur almost by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what I wanted from him was an ungarnished account of his experiences with Lena , and that I wanted this so badly that I would print his account word for word as heP261told it . He looked at me , then , and his mouth opened as if he were going to ' say something caustic . But he did not . " You mean , " he said , " you want to print her like I knew her ? " " Quite , " I said . " And more than that , I want to print her in the way you say you knew her . " " Jesus Christ , " he said . " That would n't be so bad . But you could n't print the God-damn thing . " " Why not ? " " Well , " he said , " for one thing , I 'm illiterate , and for another I ca n't control my language . I used to try , when Lena married Henry Loeffler , but it was n't any damn use . I just do n't know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't really cuss , it 's just like you use commas and things . " There was such unexpected pathos in his voice that I had to laugh . " We can leave the cuss words out , " I said . He leaned forward aggressively . " Sure . That 's right . And you 'll leave a lot of other stuff out , too . That 's just the point , God-damn it -- And so on and so on . But we finally reached an agreement ; everything was to be set down exactly as George expressedit , and then he and I would edit the record together . We even started off with a stenographer , but George did not like that and was the first to suggest that she be abandoned . As a matter of fact I have a peculiar auditory memory , a faculty that I have always believed to be connected with my passion for music , though I suppose some psychologists would not agree . After an evening with George I can go home and write down everything he said , almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the same time . That is the device we hit on , and that is the source of what follows . " I doubt , " George said , " whether Geyer was a concert singer at all . That 's a surprising thing for me to say afterP262all that 's happened and after all the dough that we both made out of her concert work , but I think she 'd agree with me if she were sitting here now looking back over it . Geyer was one hundred per cent artist . She approached every problem in her life like an artist , and the concert stage was just one of those problems . Back there in the twenties I guess she was the most popular concert singer in the country , a successoryou might say to Alma Gluck , though not really like her , because Gluck was a natural-born concert artist and Geyer was n't . Geyer taught herself to sing concerts  --  which was the difference . But we 'll come to all that later . " You can divide her concert career into two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first season at the Met , and the later one just before she retired . The second was the most important one because she proved to herself and everybodyelse that she was a great lyric singer , and I mean in comparison with the greatest we 've ever had . But I 'm going to leave that second period aside now , we can get to it later . There 's a lot of things you got to know about the earlier one if you really want to understand what Geyer was all about . " I knew about Geyer quite a while before she turned up at the Met in 1907 . In fact , I 'd heard about her as far back as 1896 , though I ca n't say as I really remembered that in 1907 . You see , I got off to kind of a slow start , my father never had any dough , and back in the nineties I was n't much better than an office boy in that joint I worked in  --  you know , the Reichmann outfit . So I was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and I do n't suppose I ever would have remembered it at all if I had n't made it my business to learn everything there was to know about Geyer so 's I could land her as a client . I guess I have to thank Joe Hofheim , who was my partner then , for my success in that direction . Joe had heard her sing at the Vienna opera , and when heP263came back raving about her like a schoolgirl I told him for Christ 's sake to grow up , was he trying to develop his vocabularyor what ? Singers , I said , were good , bad , or indifferent ; if he thought she was good we 'd have a crack at her when she got here , otherwise he was wasting his breath . " Well , we went to her debut at the Met , and like everybody else in the house I was knocked flat . The woman was everything they said about her and a lot more . She was the first singer I ever heard who got the kind of enthusiasm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ else . I 'd have gone to South Africa to hear her sing after that evening . She had everything . But above all she was exciting -- so excitingthat you forgot all about the claptrap of opera while she was on the stage and lost yourself in the part she was playing . There really never was another voice like hers , and if I say it you can believe it because voices are my business and have been for nearly forty years . " So bright and early the morning after her debut Joe Hofheim and I sat in the office figuring how to get this girl under contract before anybody else ( lid . I guess it was the biggest single problem in salesmanship I ever faced . Lena was a sure-enough wow . She had come to New York with a European reputation that stretched from London to St. Petersburg , and we did n't have to read more than two or three reviews of her first performance to realize that the New York critics had run out of adjectives . It was a cinch that every concert manager @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just like Joe and me , with the same idea  --  to get her out of the God-damn Met and onto the road . In those days the Met used to do most of the concert booking for its own artists , and take most of the percentage too , which was the way it generally managed to lose the artists that turned out to be popular in concert . One or two seasons of singing concerts chiefly for the Met 's benefit , and the singers would decide that they 'd rather give up the opera and make some money on their own . That 's how we managers made a living , and when you got a girl like this Geyer there was a general declaration of war all ' round  --  between the managers and the Met , and between the managers and the managers , if you see what I mean . " Now up to that point Joe and I had done pretty well . We had Sembrich , and we had people like dePachmann and Ysaye , so everybody in the music racket knew we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't tops either . Sembrich was our big card , but we 'd had some good breaks in landing her and we had never yet stepped out and picked up a big-time singer cold . I was hell-bent to do it now , because I 'd just married my Annie , and it was n't only that we needed dough , we were ambitious . As for Joe , if we had n't got Geyer I think he would have died . Anyway , it was Joe who cracked the nut , mostly . Geyer was a big mystery in 1907  --  she never went around and although she lived in a suite in the Plaza she 'd hardly ever see anybody and was inaccessible as hell . No one knew where she spent her time or who was intimate with her , except a few insiders ; and these were the people that Joe had made it his business to know . It seemed that she had only one intimate friend in New York  --  old Giulio Pizzetti , the singing teacher , who had taught her when she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course , but he had a kind of hankering after the old days , and since Grau and his friend Ceccarini had died , he had lived kind of a quiet life with his wife and kids and a few musikers that did n't amount to much . But Joe was on the ball and made it a point to meet him . And that 's how we got next to Geyer . The old gent was as anxious as anybody else that Geyer should n't be taken advantage of by the Met . He talkedP265her into giving us an interview , and being the boss of our concern I elected myself to do the selling . " I was kind of nervous when I rang the bell of her suite in the Plaza . Word had got around that Pop Adams , who became Gluck 's manager a little later , had approached Geyer , and that she had turned him sown flat and said that she never intended to sing any concerts  --  just opera . But anyway I pushed on . I did n't get more than two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this here deHaven . That was a shock . I had heard the gossip about the French duke , and if I did n't exactly expect to see him there twirling his mustachios , I certainlydid n't expect to be met by a Priscilla out of Godey 's Lady 's Book . I could n't make out what the hell she was doing there with Geyer , but I soon found out that she was always with her and was absolutely nuts about her . Geyer must have liked it or she would n't have had her around . I had n't spoken ten words before I thought Elsie deHaven was going to faint , because apparently I let fall a Christ or a God-damn , or something . It was kind of awkward and I was pretty sore at myself ; but you know me , Dave , I ca n't put on airs or pretend I 'm a highbrow . They can take me or leave me . That 's the way I 've always worked , and I figure it 's the best in the end because nobody @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't come off very good . Part of it was my fault , I admit . I had n't doped this gal right at all . She had such an enormous reputation , and there had been so much gossip about that duke and his finery , that I was all set to deal with a real honest-to-God prima donna like you find in the magazine serials . I knew their tricks all right and I was determined not to let Geyer get away with any of ' em , so you might say I was suspicious of her from the start . But she was just as suspicious of me , too . She kept looking at me with a fishy expression , as much as toP266say that she thought I was a bloodsucker , out to take advantage of her as a foreigner . I had to thank my stars for Joe Hofheim , because it was a cinch that if Pizzetti had n't asked her to see me she 'd have thrown me right out . " Still , there were things about that first interview that encouraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drink , and I said I did . I suppose I expected a cream de mint or something , but when she asked me if I wanted whiskey I sat up straight and said yes , and if she had rye I 'd prefer that . Well , you know , it was a little thing , but I was impressed when that rye was dragged out and it turned out to be Overholt . If you 've ever travelled around Europe you know how hard it is to get good whiskey of any kind , let alone Pittsburgh'sbest , and the fact that she had gone to the trouble of stocking up with a real American drink just a few weeks after arriving in this country gave me a clue to her characterthat I was never to forget . I took out a cigar and asked her if she minded , and she said right out that she did . So I said that was all right , I would n't light it . That 's how it happened I was always chewing an unlighted cigar when I was with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if there was anything unnatural in that . " We got down to business pretty quick . Geyer said she understood I wanted to be her concert manager and I said I did , and asked if she had one of those Metropolitan contractsgiving them concert percentages . She looked at me for a minute with the kind of a shrewd look a Jew will turn on before coming to the point  --  though she was n't a Jew  --  and said , Mr. Phillips , did you think I was a stranger to the Metropolitan ? ' I admitted I did n't , not exactly . So if they had any tricks I would know them , would n't I ? ' she asked . She was a wonderful woman . Here she 'd been in Europe for ten years and she spoke English like anybody else in NewP267York  --  not that she should n't , but show me how many prima donnas from the Vienna Hofoper and God knows what other royal houses would show up in New York talking plain English . " Geyer then handed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never really sung in concert and that while she was pleased by my offer she did n't know whether she had the right to consider it . Do you mean you 've never sung a concert ? ' I asked . I could n't believe my ears . ' : ' Tot exactly that , ' she said . It seemed that the only concerts she had sung had been those command performances in palaces beforeroyalty  --  you know , she said , a couple of big arias and two groups of Lieder , and then the order of this or that with a big medal and some indigestible supper and home . I laughed some at that . But pretty soon I got serious and explained to her what concert business was in the United States . With her reputation she ought to clean up more money than anybody in the world . Like most opera singers she 'd never bothered to get the real contrast between America and Europe  --  here there 's only one opera house and plain people do n't go to it anyway . But let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there wo n't be a Main Street in Dakota that wo n't have heard of her . This was all news to Geyer , not that she might n't have figured it out for herself , but she 'd never bothered to . She 'd come back to the United States to sing at the Met , and nothing else seemed to be of any importance . " While I was talking she kept looking at me with a sort of quizzical expression and finally she asked me why I thought she 'd be any good as a concert singer . There was a big differencebetween that and opera . I told her I knew right away as soon as she opened her mouth that with that kind of a voice and personality she could sing anything . The dif. -  ference between you and most opera singers , ' I told her , is that the others depend on the costume and scenery and story and all the other make-believe to give ' em personality and glamour . You make your own glamour as you go along , and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as on the operatic stage . ' That pleased her , I guess . But I saw right away that she was n't one of the girls you could land with a little flattery , because pretty soon she frowned and said that that might be true enough , but the concert stage required a different technique and she was n't sure whether she could master it , or even wanted to try . " Of course , ' I said , the main reason for going into the concert business is the money you can make out of it . ' " For instance , ' she said . " Well , ' I said , how much are you making at the Met ? ' " One thousand a performance , ' she said , for this season . ' " I told her that after one season on the road she could get a concert guarantee of three thousand at the very least , and with two or three concerts a week she could see what that would come to . She looked pretty impressed , but she was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what a tour would be like , and I began telling her . You know I 'm a pretty straight guy , Dave , and I honestly did try to describe a concert tour the way it really is . But as I look back on it now I have to laugh , because concert-touring with Geyer turned out to be something different from anything God ever thought up before . What I knew about touring then was just kindergarten stuff , as I 'll show you in a minute . But anyway . As I was talking you ought to have seen Geyer 's face . When I first came into the room she had been pretty much on her dignity and kind of cold , but I no sooner got to describing life in the sticks than she leaned forward and looked at me like a little girl listening to a fairy story . I 'd only meant to be up thereP269about half an hour , but it was two hours later when I looked at my watch , and I was still talking and she would n't let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about Texas and Iowa and the Pacific coast and the Mississippi River and those damned prairie ovens out in Kansas . " I knew Joe would be passing kittens down at the office , so eventually I had to break up the meeting of my own accord . I swear , though I 'd been there maybe three hours altogether , she did n't want me to leave . Elsa deHaven was fidgeting , and Dora , the maid , kept popping into the room and glaring at me and saying things to Geyer in Czech , but she kept waving them away and telling me to go on . So I learned something . I learned that Lena had a kind of passion for America , the kind that the immigrants have . This is stronger sometimes , and always more romantic , than the way we born Americans feel . I guess maybe you 'll be able to explain it in your book  --  it goes back to Lena 's childhood in some way . Anyhow , it was the thing that got Lena and me started together , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She used to say the only reason she went into concertswas because I sold her America in that first interview . I know she was kind of joking , but I know too that her feelingabout this country was what induced her to put up with the things she had to put up with on the road . And in a way , it was why she had a liking for me , too . " It took a long time to bring Lena around to the idea of singing concerts . That first winter she was so excited over seeing Pizzetti and Mahler again that she did n't want to put her mind on anything else . After I had got to know her a little  --  I used to go back to see her when the show broke , or in the afternoon at the hotel  --  she explained to me that having Pizzetti and Mahler together , in the same place at the same time , made her feel as if two big rivers had met and joined into one . She was a funny woman that way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her friends and sentimental about ' em . The three of ' em used to sit around in her parlor drinking red ink and going over every note she 'd ever sung , in Vienna with Mahler and in New York when Pizzetti was her teacher . Once I described her life to Sam as one long happy post-mortem , and somehow it got back to her and she laughed and said I was just a hardboiledson of a bitch  --  or words to that effect . She grew to like me though , and one night she asked me down to sit in on her gang . I was kind of quiet that time and did n't say much , but I had a hunch I 'd crashed the charmed circle and that things were going to come my way sooner or later . " Do n't mistake me , Dave . I was after this girl as a client sure enough , but I 've got to confess she put the Indian sign on me too . I mean , I was n't ever in love with her exactly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I had Annie , and Annie was my type . If you can picture me making a pass at Geyer you 've got a better imagination than I was born with . But as I say I was moonstruck  --  you could n't see her all the time and not be . I do n't think I ever could have advised her to do anything against her own interests , no matter how much I might have stood to gain . This does n't make me out to be a Christer , it was just the way she affected anybody that had anything to do with her , from Dora up to the duke . " But if you 're really going to be honest in your book , you better put this down : Geyer was a damn limited person . She was the most limited person I ever met , and when I look back on it I do n't see how it was possible for a woman of her glamour and reputation to get through life with so few real friends , and so few real interests , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but she was n't broad . She was vertical , not horizontal , if you see what I mean . You can countP271the people she opened up to on the fingers of one hand , and the things she was interested in on the fingers of the other . I guess that 's the way a person gets to be great , but it used to worry me and it still does . Me , I 'm interested in a dozen different things all at the same time and if I 'm not mixing around with people I get restless . And of course that 's my trade . But even at the other extreme  --  and I admit that a lot of the big-time singers belong there  --  I 've never seen anybodythat lived in as small a world as Geyer . " I do n't think it was a good thing either . So far as I know  --  and I know a lot  --  Lena never looked at a pair of pants just as pants , and you ca n't tell me that 's the way things ought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her attitude toward this duke was , and I do n't know whether she really did have a lot of lovers over in Europe , the way they say she did . I never asked her , and she probably would have told me to go to hell if I had asked . But on this side you can take it from me there was n't anybody . " Now I see you 're looking at me kind of funny and I know who you 've got in mind . I confess I 'm just as puzzled as you are , and if I was going to make an exception to what I just said it would be this here Guido Vestri . Of course you heard him as much as I did , and you know a lot more about why he was a good conductor than I do , but when you asked me the other day what I knew about him personally I realized what a kid you are  --  you were n't old enough to get around and hear about him back in the old days . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young to have heard much about the personal life of Guido Vestri . And when I began to gather the material for this book , I naturally attempted to turn to Vestri himself as I had to all of Lena 's other intimate associates . I received a rebuff so frigid and so conclusive that there was no possible way ofP272pursuing the matter further . My personal mortification was only exceeded by my distress at the serious handicap to my work . I was forced to gather what I now know of Vestri in a hundred indirect ways , and so much gossip drifted into my hands that it became difficult to separate the hearsay from the possible truth . Of course I knew Guido Vestri only as a conductor , and one of the greatest ; the most wonderful experiences of my life were the operas he conducted with Lena Geyer singing . Beyond that I knew only that he was an excitable , eccentric bachelor , a genius , and a man who had his way with everything and everybody around the opera house . As a boy I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ together that I never really thought about them as a man and a woman . It was not until I began putting Lena 's life to intimate scrutiny that I realized how profound had been Vestri 's influence upon it . The deeper I probed , the more clearly I saw that he was the mainspring not only of her singing , but of her whole idea of mature life . So when George mentioned Guido Vestri , I very naturally encouraged him to tell me all he knew of the man ; no detail seemed too minute to be important . " Vestri came to the Met some years before Lena did , " George said . " I ca n't remember just when it was . He came to conduct the Italian operas . At least that 's the way he started , but he did n't stay put in the Italian stuff , which was what raised all the hell . He was the Goddamnedestmusician I ever heard , and I know you agree . He was born somewhere near Naples in one of those big Wop families @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a kid he used to work in a travelling opera company with his parents , in the chorus or something like that . They were always broke . When he was about ten he wasP273already letting on what a natural-born genius he was  --  he used to holler and have fits if he heard anybody play or sing wrong . They sent him to the Naples Conservatory and he turned out to be a pianist . After he graduated , though , he was n't interested in the piano . He went right back to the God-damn opera and got a job as rehearsal pianist  --  what 's the long word they call it ?  --  hell  --  correpetiteur . " You can imagine how he liked sitting at a piano taking orders from plumbers , but it wasn t long before he became a conductor himself . I got the story from Lena , and it 's worth repeating because I never heard it anywhere else and I doubt if you have . It seems that one day the regular conductor was late to a rehearsal and Vestri began without @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he played the piano and conductedand started ripping hell out of the first act of Traviata , I think it was . When the regular conductor got there he heard that act for the first time in his life . He stood there like a dope for a few minutes , and then the damn fool went so crazy with jealousy that instead of sitting down to find some nice back-handed way to get rid of the kid , he rushed to the manager and said he wanted Vestri fired . The managerasked what Vestri was doing and the conductor was too excited to talk sense  --  he just stood there bellowing ; so the manager ran to the rehearsal room to see what it was all about , and the minute he got inside the door he stopped dead and never moved till the rehearsal was all over . Then he fired the conductor and gave Vestri the job . I guess Vestri was eighteen or nineteen then  --  he was five or six years older than Lena . " He just went ahead and gave that kind of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't heard anything like him in Italy for years . Some people say they never had . I ca n't tell you anything you do n't know about him as a musician .   except to remind you that Lena always said he was great because he played exactly what the composer wrote  --  no more , no less . I remember once  --  it was after Vestri had left the Metropolitan  --  a young twirp of a new conductor from Vienna was trying to show off and he told Lena to sing some passage different from the way she did . I was in at the rehearsal because I wanted to see her right afterward about some business . You ought to have seen her face when that guy told her what he wanted . She opened her mouth a couple of times , and then she said , ' Excuse me , I think I sang it exactly as it is in the score . ' The guy told her never mind the score , he wanted it his way . Lena left her position and came down to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dirty look on her face , with one eyebrow crooked . ' Maybe you 're entitled to make cuts in this score , ' she said , ' but what you leave of it I am going to sing exactly as Wagner wrote it . Or else I do n't sing . ' " But to get back to Vestri . He conducted in Italy for quite a while  --  ten or a dozen years , I guess  --  and nobody knew about him over here . Then Santino , the great baritone , was brought to the Met from the San Carlo in Nap ! es , and the cards just fell so Santino got listened to when he said anything . He was a world-beater if I ever saw one . You remember him . Anyway he did n't like this and he did n't like that around the Met , and all the things he kicked about were real things , not just hogwash because somebody else got bigger billing or better parts . One day he was singing in a dress rehearsal of Rigoletto and the conductor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't remember , some Dago or other , he ran the whole Italian shebang there . Anyway he was rotten and he plumbered the orchestra in Santino 's big aria , you know , that La ra La ra thing . Santino was fit to be tied , he nearly burst a blood vessel . He shook his fistsp275and roared and called the conductor an assassin and a butcher and a shoemaker . One of the board of directors was in the house listening to the rehearsal and he called down out of his box and asked Santino if this was such a pig of a conductor , where did he know of a better one ? Most people would be scared at this . But Santino probably thought he was going to be fired anyway , so he said , Signor , there is only one conductoralive who is fit to play Verdi and that is Guido Vestri at the San Carlo . ' The upshot of it was that the next season Vestri was conducting at the Metropolitan . " Well , for a while after she got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention to this guy Vestri . Oh hell , she knew he was good , she was no dope , but with that queer narrowness of hers she was really only interested in Mahler . He conducted her debut in Don Giovanni . It was maybe a month before she got to do an opera with Vestri , and naturally she was impressed right away quick . It was Trovator , . I was at the performance and boy !  --  do I remember that ! One night up at her place Lena said she 'd never known the old organ-grinder 's opera was music until Vestri showed her . Everybody nodded , Mahler too . They all agreed that Vestri was the works for Italian music and especially for Verdi . Nobody said anything about him in German music because nobody knew he could do it . He sprang that the next year . But once he discovered Lena he had her in more and more of his casts . He used to follow her around with his eyes while she was on the stage , but he handled her musically @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bark out his orders once , and for Lena that was enough . He was the boss  --  she was scared to death of him , and the better she got to know him the more scared she was . Incidentally , he never sat down when he was conducting , not even in rehearsals . Once he said something about some other conductor to sorties in the Bois , for which my mother was growing too old , and for which he felt himself suited by convention and prejudice . But picture my astonishment when , after sending up my name at the Hotel Regina , and waiting in the lobby while Rouart held my bays outside , to be greeted by a girl , a child , who almost danced out of the lift and offered me her hand with a sparkling smile of greeting ! My heart rose in a joyful sweep to my lips , and I pressed its very essence upon her glove . With a step so light that I could not reconcile it to the stately tread of the woman I had met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the sight of my smart turnout , fresh in its yellow paint and glistening from its morning polish , with the glossy bays prancing and champing , she clapped her hands . " Oh , how beautiful ! " she cried . " How wonderful ! How could you know how much this would please me ? " She sprang into her place , Rouart placed the broadcloth throw across her knees , and then took his seat .
