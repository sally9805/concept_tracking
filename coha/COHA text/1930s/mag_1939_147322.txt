At Cleveland last week , William Capps , a 19-year-old Negro from Somerset , Ky. , hopped a freight train bound for Toledo , where he hoped to find work . Hanging on a ladder between box cars , he nodded . Suddenly he felt himself falling , grabbed wildly , caught a lower rung of the ladder . As he did so his left foot touched a spinning train wheel . The foot was pulled in and crushed between wheel top and car bottom . <P> In agony , William Capps hung on for about a quarter of a mile . Then he dropped from the train and crawled into a weed clump . His foot was a pulp and he was afraid of gangrene . Gritting his teeth , he pulled out his penknife , carefully cut off his foot , twisted his sweater around the stump to stop the bleeding . <P> Next he made a pair of crutches from limbs of a nearby tree . In spite of pain and weakness he began hobbling along the tracks . What happened in the hours that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours , a mile from the patch of weeds where he had left his amputated foot , he fell fainting before an astonished train crew . <P> When he awoke at St. Joseph 's Hospital , in Lorain , Ohio , William Capps begged for chicken and watermelon . " I might die , " he urged . Doctors put him to sleep again and amputated the rest of his leg to a point five inches below the knee . <P> " William is one plucky boy , " said Dr. William E. Wheatley . " He did a fair job of amputation , although , of course , he risked serious danger of infection from his knife . He 'll pull through all right . "
