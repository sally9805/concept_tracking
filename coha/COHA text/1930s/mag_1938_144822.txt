Two months ago Franklin Roosevelt said he wanted the various systems of bank examinations standardized . Last week from this acorn had sprung an oak : exams were not only unified but the banks ' lending policies had been greatly changed by a new extension of New Deal credit control . <P> That four different systems of examinations-by the Federal Reserve , Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , the Comptroller of the Currency , and the States-bothered bankers was only one of the reasons the Administration wanted them unified . Of more immediate concern was a belief that the various stiff restrictions on bank investments might explain the fact that today U. S. banks have $2,780,000,000 in excess reserves sitting idle . This second idea of Mr. Roosevelt 's did not appear until last fortnight . Until then a committee of underlings had been absorbed solely in the technicalities of unifying the existing examinations . Fortnight ago , in a letter to Senator Vandenburg , Federal Reserve Board Chairman Marriner Stoddard Eccles suggested that bank regulations should be loosened in depressions when credit is needed , tightened in booms @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately apparent that Acting Comptroller Marshall Diggs , FDIC Chairman Leo Crowley and Secretary of the Treasury Morgenthau preferred to regard bank regulations as safeguards for depositors . Last week , after hot &; heavy debate , the four reached a compromise " through the usual democratic processes of give &; take . " The National Association of Supervisors of State Banks approved . So did Franklin Roosevelt . The new rules go into effect July first . Important changes : <P> Loans are reclassified as I , II , III , IV , instead of " slow , " " doubtful , " and " loss , " and bankers may make sound commercial loans for longer than nine months without the loans being criticized by examiners as " slow . " <P> Banks may now invest in unlisted securities and those without public distribution , provided the issuer can service the loan . <P> Only 50% instead of 100% for net depreciation of defaulted and doubtful loans will be used in computing a bank 's net sound capital .           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
