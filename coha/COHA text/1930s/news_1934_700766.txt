txt A short cotton crop , which will mean a less than normal production and carryover of cotton seed oil , probably will bring large inventory profits to the two companies doing the largest portion of the cotton seed oil business of the country , Procter &; Gamble and Wesson Oil &; Snowdrift Co . Cotton seed oil is used largely as shortening , as salad oil , as a substitute for lard in such trademarked products as Wesson Snowdrift and P. &; G. 's Crisco , and in margarines . It is expected that lard and butter prices will be high this winter because of reduced production of hogs and of milk . Butter has already risen materially in the last few months , and when these two food products are high in price , use of such fat substitutes as Snowdrift and Crisco is encouraged . As a matter of fact these two vegetable shortenings , made by an expensive hydrogenation process , always have been slightly more expensive than lard , but as the price difference narrows it will be to the advantage of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Year In recent years consumption of cottonseed oil has averaged around 3,500,000 barrels annually until the last year or so when use dropped to around 3.000,000 barrels . Production has ranged from 3,000,000 to 4,000,000 barrels , with annual carryover averaging around 900,000 to 1,000.000 barrels . From 1925 to 1930 the price of cotton oil ' has ranged from 8 cents to 16 cents a pound with the annual average around 10 cents a pound . In the past year , however , . sevacry2o.yer increased to about : /- , 850,000- barrels ( estimated ) which was responsible or putting the price down to a low of 4.20 cents a pound . Due to the reduced cotton crop , however , it is estimated that production of oil this year may fall as low as 2.300,000 barrels . This , coupled with a moderate increase in consumption , is likely to decrease carryover to around its normal level of 850.000 or 900,000 barrels . Price of oil already has started to discount this condition , rising to over 7 cents a pound . The largest stocks ci oil in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it for soap as well as Crisco. and by Wesson Oil which sells oil at wholesale as well as in manufactured form . NVesson inventory $18.073.403 The size of Procter dr Gamble 's supply is not known , since it is incl ? 0ed in its general inventory , but Wesson , which does business solely in cotton oil and its products , had on May 31 , 1934. an inventory of 518,073,403 . This includes crude oil , finished products and also seed cake sold as cattle feed . This inventory has been accumulated since last fall when price of crude oil was around 3 cents a pound . There are 400 pounds of oil to a barrel , so every fluctuation of a cent a. pound on this basis would make a difference of 54 a barrel . Business in seed cake for cattle feed already has been materially improved as a result of the drought which destroyed natural pasturage . Procter &; Gamble 's principal business is soap , of which it produces about 40% of the country 's total .

Has 13 Crushing Other compound shortenings also are made by P. to G. for general use and for bakers , and much oil is sold to makers of salad dressings and margarine . Procter owns 13 cotton seed crushing mills , but these ate insufficient to supply all the oil needed for its own use , so it normally buys large tonnage from other mills . Cotton seed oil accounts for roughly 25% of Procter s total tonnage sales . The rising hog market and higher lard prices have not yet been reflected in any increase in sales of Procter 's food products . as the price differential is still too large . Further advance in lard , however , may help this division of the business . Two important producers of margarine who are consumers of cotton oil are Gold Dust Corp .. making Nucoa Nut butter , and Glidden Co. the largest maker of margarine in the country .

In recent years , sales of margarine have fallen materially below former normal levels .
