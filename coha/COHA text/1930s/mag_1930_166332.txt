At Christmas time mean acts seem exceptionally vicious . In Manhattan one William Heimsberger sold all the Christmas presents of his five children and bought liquor . In Washington some one sent to a young bride a Christmas box which exploded , killing the girl and her baby brother . <P> Just before Christmas a little white dog whimpered in a St. Louis alley . A woman approached it , found it scrawny and starving , suddenly noticed to her horror that its lips were sewn together with heavy cord . The Humane Society of Missouri was notified . Robert F. Sellar , secretary of the society , declared last week that he had gone to the dog and instantly put it to death . From all over the country , incensed humanitarians wired promises of reward to him who should find the torturer . Last week the rewards totaled $3,000 , not including a $500 reward which the Humane Society offered to the woman who found the dog and who has since been missing . <P> St. Louis officials were greatly concerned . A lieutenant of detectives @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From Texas , J. Waddy ( " Hot Dog " ) Tate , irrepressible Mayor of Dallas , wired : <P> " If you catch the scoundrel who sewed up that poor dog 's mouth as reported in the press , ship him to Dallas . We have a way of taking care of those fellows . "
