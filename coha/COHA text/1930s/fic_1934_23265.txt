ELP4- ( iN PIONEERS HAVE CHILDREN A STORY BY GRIFFITH BEEMS MHZ train started evenly , power ' fully ; the narrow platform , the negro porters , no longer burdened , returning in two 's and three 's , the lowering underground pillars turned past the car windows with accelerating in-distinction ; twenty seconds of sunlight and widening echoes , and the train on its way westward sounded into the descending fleeting tunnel beneath the Hudson River . It emerged at forty miles an hour , clacking across the Jersey salt meadows . Horace Plummer , slouched at length on the dust-green upholstery of a compartment , closed his eyes against the summer glare . He was waiting for the significance of his journey , now that he was committed to it , to become clear . He rested , heels crossed on the radiator frame underneath the windows , a commanding man with iron-gray hair , one thick-fingered hand tapping his thigh in slow time to the steely reiteration of the wheels . The gray business suit with the pencil stripe was too carefully tailored to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vest parted slightly from the top of the trousers . He had undertaken the journey certain that as the train started and he lay back in his seat , passively expectant , his purpose in returning to Amaryllis would reveal itself , clearly and satisfactorily . As he had followed the redcap porter through the vastness of the station , the reservation which his secretary had delivered to him an hour before train-time near to hand in his pocket , he had had a sense of action and commitment ; he was conscious of himself , the image of himself , step following step , on his way westward . Now the feeling and the image were gone ; nothing followed . Slowly he realized that clarification did not follow . In its stead there came over him the prospective tedium of the journey . It would be no different from any other trip , hammered monotone from the rails , grating stresses from the car trucks , raised voices , smell of hot rubber , enamel , velour , and more than all else , endurance of the slow exhaustion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He went back over the day , seeking for portents , recalling those who had said good-by to him , the clerk at the club that morning and after him the doorman , later at the office , Friedman , Cooper , Marvin , his secretary , the boy who carried down his grip and called the taxi ; for them the trip was indistinguishable from any other . If he had been leaving for the South Seas , he thought , there would have been the same incurious deferential courtesy . Respect was like insulating material . Not one of them actually knew or was interested in him . The bar of sunlight slanting through the windows penetrated uncomfortably warm across his ankles ; he with-drew his feet indolently . Edith at least was interested . Sorting through the papers in his inside pocket until he came to his wife 's letter , he reread it : We are all disappointed that you are not coming this week-end . John and Ted have been particularly counting on you and have worked like Trojans fixing the springboard so you wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course I know that you have had this trip in mind for a long time ? a form of sentimental pilgrimage , is n't that what it really is ? But a telegram is abrupt , and as there was time to write , a letter , really , even like the telegram only eight words long , would have been more thoughtful , Horace . The man with the telegram drove up as we finished dinner , which enabled everyone to observe that I was taken by surprise . Mother and Elizabeth and Cousin Sterling immediately wanted to know all the whys and wherefores , and when I explained as best I could , they thought you quixotic , to say the least , what with impossible weather for traveling , and Iowa in August no doubt like a furnace . You usually know your own mind , so I wo n't try to dissuade you from going . Do keep out of the sun . I always thought that when you visited Amaryllis you would take the boys with you . They ought to become acquainted with your side @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly do n't want them to become eastern snobs with a provincial outlook as you call it . They are old enough now to benefit by meeting their western cousins and experimenting with others ' points of view . Do n't you think you might consider taking them ? Although , as you are apparently going alone , I suppose you want to go alone . We wish you a good journey and Ted and John can be ready by Friday if you want them . The train crossed a river . The sound of the wheels resonated from the quivering bridge . Mr. Plummer 's solid right hand with the letter in it fell on the seat beside him . " Sentimental pilgrimage , " he thought derisive/y , " quixotic . " Edith was too glib ; her knack for words always got ahead of her judgment . He was never sentimental and he was not the sort to renounce the world and go on pilgrimages . That was certain . And this sudden notion that the boys ought to meet his side of the family  --  she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Fred ran a garage in Eureka , South Dakota ; that Carrie was dying of cancer in Texas , and that Louise was now in Santa Monica . No one living remained at Amaryllis . They were scattered westward . Only the two graves remained . Edith forgot because she was not interested in his side of the family . The Burtons sufficed her , and along with great aunts , cousins , and uncles by marriage they were enough to suffice anyone . When he thought of what Dave Plummer at fifty-six had probably become  --  a weatherbeaten soddy with a second wife and grandchildren on an unimproved homestead  --  the notion of bringing Ted and John thirteen hundred miles to meet Dave was preposterous . He could see their uneasy boyish condescension , the hand offered , elbow stiff by the side . They would probably look down on him for owning to such a stepbrother . Mr. Plummer tore his wife 's letter into strips and twice across and put the pieces in his pocket . Of course the boys were hardly to blame for their attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seeing Dave again himself . A much worse fault of their Burton upbringing was that it did not prepare them to see through charming spongers such as Uncle Anson . And there was Uncle Jefferson , living shut away in a house like a woman and stuttering in front of the dictaphone . Jefferson did not realize when he related the dicta-phone anecdote , making it as long and as lively as possible , that he was confessing his own incompetence . Ted and John had to get more hard-headed business sense than the Burtons or the future would make fools of them . Lean worn headstones and modern white signpost " Burton Lane 1691 " might go on standing in Tewksbury , Connecticut , to the end of time ; but the Burtons , for all their pretensions , were another matter . They were fortunate in having had him to get them out of railroads and municipals into public utilities at the right time . Edith had done the family a good turn by her marriage , and in their hearts they knew and looked up to him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gone west , and that was the only real difference . His own father , for instance , had been born in Marietta , Ohio , in 1849 , and if running after ancestors were not such a silly business , Grandfather Plummer 's movements could certainly still be traced eastward . Outside the car windows in a flat industrialized landscape the color of metal and ashes , factory succeeded factory . Mr. Plummer , giving up surmises as to what the family , particularly Elizabeth , would be likely to say to him if he employed a genealogical researcher , began reading the large-lettered names and trademarks advertised on water tanks , chimneys , fences , and long brick buildings , grimy dark with windows . The familiar names turned idly in his mind . Behind a high woven-steel fence , topped with a barbed wire overhang , the words " Rahway Plant  --  American Synthetics , Inc. " on a white signboard standing over the black bowls of two waiting spot lamps , started the recollection of a conversation with Corlears in the dub lounge . Taking out a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ get details AS-DX deal through T , " and gave himself up to checking through the list of his competitors in search for American Synthetics ' tie-in on phenol supply . Among the factories , towns of poor houses repeated themselves . Mr. Plummer pulled his grip from underneath the seat where the redcap hadplaced it and took out a magazine and a book , unbuttoned his vest , and began reading Chapter IX of Cartels , Trusts and Combines . After late dinner in the dining car , Mr. Plummer walked back through the swaying train to the observation lounge . It was half full . A young woman at the writing table was dashing off a letter , smoking a cigarette , and watching herself and the speeding room behind her in the wall mirror . Mr. Plummer read and now and then listened to the conversation of a man several chairs away , apparently attorney to a liability insurance company , who complained to those on either side of him against the excessive claims , faked accidents , and perjured testimony , particularly that of doctors , with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ looked at his watch it was half-past ten . He took a railway folder from the rack and read the time-table . They were now in the Alleghenies , two hours east of Pittsburgh . As he turned the booklet it came open at a map , displaying the railroad as a factitiously straight heavy black line between New York and Chicago . Beyond Chicago the map was blank . Unsummoned and unexpected , there came to him remembrance of his school geography , a thin green book , each chapter embellished with scrolls and medallions showing the natives and products of the respective countries . One day with his ruler he had projected on the map a journey round the world , starting from Amaryllis , which he had located and printed large , and proceeding westward through the principal cities and wonders . He included Ceylon so as to see Adam 's Footprint . Carefully he had retraced his penciling in ink . Fred Bender , when he bought the book , third- or fourth-hand by then , complained about the ink marks . He could still see the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a pink Europe . If he should now draw the actual journey , the line eastward , the coil of lines around New York , the loops reaching in many directions , even to London and Berlin , it would be on the seaboard that the ink would run together and blot . But even at that moment he was projecting a line , engaged in drawing it westward , which , unlike any of the other lines , touched the beginning point , ended there , made a knot as though the loose ends of a tangled length of string had been tied together . He exclaimed at the sudden envisioning . This was the image he had sought . This was the logic of his return demonstrable upon the map . Slapping his thigh with satisfaction , he went out on the observation platform and stood by the barrier . He was knotting loose ends together . The wind , lifting and whirling in the wake of the train , wrenched at his clothes and scurried across his skin . With one hand he held his straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the polished brass of the barrier . His cigar burned fast . There was exhilaration in the cool troubled air . At his feet the clamoring railheads issued from beneath his own flying down-spread shadow and as swiftly vanished in the greater shadow of the night . From flange and rail occasionally sparks flashed . The train followed along a river between mountains . Against the lesser darkness of the water now and then he discerned tipples , chimneys , a row of gondolas . The soot falling on his face made him withdraw to a chair in the lee of the platform and , lulled with swift motion , he watched the backward-soaring signal gantries mounted with discs of triple-set yellow incandescence , under whose power the trackage shone in lengthening , waving , silver-gleaming lines . He had not thought of Fred Bender for years and years . He remembered the chivaree after Fred 's wedding , the bunch riding back in the hay rack , most of them slightly tipsy from Fred 's hard cider , whanging tin pans and singing " Out of the way for old Dan @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ morning . Someone dared the girls to prove they were not bowlegged , and Nellie Graves stood up to do so among whistles and cheers when a jolt of the wagon toppled her into his lap . The memory was so strong , so compelling , that by comparison the years since he had come to New York , years in which from secretary to old Colonel Donner he came to succeed him , married Edith Burton , made a name for himself , these years seemed confused , torrential . It was his earlier years that in his mind had meat and marrow . There were the stories he had told in so many lounges , over so many dinner tables  --  the summer he traveled round Iowa as a foot racer under changing names , while his sidekicks , Tim and Jerry Bresnahan , worked up races with various local prides and covered all bets ; at Algona they met a ringer from Omaha who won by six inches and took them for three hundred dollars , the season 's money ; old man Shapley 's advice to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bazaar , that a young man was smarter to save money , get an education in bookkeeping and stenography and hike for the city than to sit down and wait for a dry goods inventory to move itself off the shelves  --  but these stories were staled with retelling and his imagination warmed and went on to neglected things . He remembered the farm , the house his father built the year he was born , every stick hauled sixty-five miles by wagon from Council Bluffs , the thatched sheds , boarded on the north and west , the well-windlass , the short cut to Uncle Taylor 's through the slough where the bluestem grew higher than his head , the outdoor cave full of potatoes and cabbage and brine jars of wild plums and crab apples ; blindfolded he could still put his hand on the joist where the file for the spade was hidden . On one side of the house , fifty yards away on a slight rise , fenced with drooping cast-iron chains , lay his mother 's grave . She had died when he was born @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the plot ; he remembered the first blossoms , irregular and sparse , that came one spring . His father never allowed anyone to break the blossoms or bring them into the house , and one of his summer chores had been keeping the grass cut with a sickle . The tombstone would be gray and old now and they were both buried there , as Ma Plummer had promised his father . He recalled Ma 's letter to him at the time in which she wrote that she did not approve of having the dead buried out of reach of a church but that she believed flouting the wishes of the dead was worse . He had been too poor to return from New York for the funeral but he had paid his share for the monument , and years later , when Dave sold the farm , he took care to reserve the burying ground . Ma was dead too , probably interred at Brokenbow , for she had been staying with Dave . He remembered her well , large , easy-going , the skin below her right @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ soapmaking . In the middle of the night she was shaking him awake . " Get up , Hoddie , " she said , " there ' re horse thieves out in the barn . " His father was flat on his back with malaria . Together they went out on the back stoop . The moon had set , and the horses were stomping in the barn . Ma had the double-barreled shotgun . In her nightgown she seemed very big and he was not afraid . " Yell like a man , Hoddie , " she said , " make them thinkyou 're a man . " She shot off both barrels , one after the other , and he yelled , " Get out of there , you horse thieves , you . " Afterwards the family jollied him for not swearing at the thieves and he used to tell his stepbrothers all the dirty cusswords he would have shouted if Ma had not been there . Ma did not like profanity because she was a Methodist . While they were lighting the lantern they heard horses going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but Uncle Taylor and the posse rode the thieves so hard the colt was cut loose . The colt had been afraid to ford the Nishnabotna River and was picked up grazing on the bottoms . He remembered the Sunday they drove over to the Nishnabotna to go fishing , his father and Ma , with Louise between them , on the spring seat , and Dave , Fred , Carrie , and himself along with a ten-gallon vinegar keg half full of salt for preserving the fish jolting round together for ten miles on the straw in the wagon box . He had never before seen a river . Ma refused to go because the day was the Sabbath but she fixed them a dinner and at the last minute decided to come so as to keep everyone out of trouble . They had unhitched in Hopkins Grove . Seed squirters were scattering from the great silver maple trees . The Nishnabotna was shallow , clay-bedded , and lined with willows . Their father made jokes about it and told them that the Mississippi where he used to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as wide as the Nishnabotna was long . Their father fished for cat while they waded farther downstream , trying to herd minnies . When the fishpole came floating by they splashed out and caught it . Their father was disgusted . He said he would be damned before he would treat a finger-length shiner as a fish and told them to fill the keg with maple seeds rather than go home empty-handed . When they got back their father plowed furrows to the west of the house and planted the seeds . The maples came up , rows of scraggly saplings , which he thinned with the axe . And he remembered many other things : standing in the snow to peek by turns through a crack in the schoolhouse , watching the teacher take off the black knitted tights she wore underneath her skirts in winter ; his span of ponies and patent-leather dashboard when he began driving into town ; Professor Garrison 's elocution classes ; the la-de-da silk vest he scrimped and saved for months to buy ; his fight with Luke Maynard in the cow pasture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time they put lampblack in the holy-water stoup ; the poker games in the room back of Doc McKinstry 's office  --  deliberately Mr. Plummer took from his pocket the scraps of his wife 's letter . They were caught in the wind rushing from beneath the train and fluttered into the darkness , disturbed and upborne by an invisible current . Mr. Plummer was hot . As he walked over the last rise he wiped his face with his handkerchief and , narrowing his eyes against the light , looked across the fields to the farm . Within a windbreak of trees , set well back from the road , he saw a house and a weathered red barn with silo and outbuildings . The hay mow door hung open and above the treetops the vanes of the windmill were turning . The buildings were unfamiliar . Mr. Plummer recognized the distance from the highway to the house , the worn slope ft am house to barn , the lay of the land  --  a stand of red clover grew where the slough had been and there was a straw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , more piled together , more cluttered . Mr. Plummerchanged his coat to his other arm and walked on . The name on the mailbox was " 0 . Skarstad . " Standing by the farm gate , he dried his face with his handkerchief again and listened to the pigeons cooing and the creaking shuddering stroke of the windmill as it pumped water . Everything else was quiet . At one end of the bare porch the floor had sagged and rotted away from the pillar . Half-grown buff chickens were hunting through the whitetop and smart-weed in the yard . As he turned the corner of the house a collie lying beside a broken blue dish got up and began barking methodically . In the hack the house had an ell that ended in a woodshed . A woman in a blue percale dress came to the door and stood looking at him through the screen . On the stone step at her feet lay a hammer and pliers . " Good morning , " Mr. Plummer said , taking off his hat . " Is n't this the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Olas Skarstad live here . " " Are you Mrs. Skarstad ? " " Sure . " " I used to live here when I was a boy , " Mr. Plummer said . " We moved away a long time ago . I happened to be in Amaryllis so I walked out to see the old place . It 's changed a great deal since I was a boy . " The woman did not speak . " Do you mind if I look round a bit , Mrs. Skarstad ? " " Sure . Go ahead , " the woman said . She turned away from the door . " Tekla , " she called . " Tekla . " When Tekla came she stood in the door beside her mother . Mrs. Skarstad spoke to her in a language that Mr. Plummer did not understand and opened the screen and pushed Tekla out , flapping her apron at the flies . " Tekla show you , " Mrs. Skarstad said . Tekla , " Mr. Plummer said . Tekla stood on the stone step with one hand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a knob . Tekla was about eleven . She had a clean chubby face , bobbed hair , and her faded pink dress was too large for her . She was barefoot . " I 've got a boy just a bit more than your size , " Mr. Plummer said . " His name is John . " Tekla looked solemnly at Mr. Plummer . " What grade is he in ? " she demanded . " He 's in fourth form . " " I 'm in fifth grade next year myself , " Tekla said . " I go in the bus . " Mrs. Skarstad disappeared from the doorway . " Do you like going to school ? " " Just as soon . " " What did you do to your legs ? " " Scratches , " Tekla said . " Do you want to see the barn ? " " I 'd like to very much . " Tekla showed him the barn , stalls , oat bins , hay mow , silo , machinery sheds , water tank , hog pens , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recognize any of the buildings . " What else du you want to see ? " " Do you know where the graves are , Tekla ? " " There are lots of graves in town , " Tekla said . " The cemetery there is pretty . It 's on a hill . " " Come with me , " Mr. Plummer said , " and I 'll show you . " He walked westward from the house through a grove of shady trees . Underneath the trees there were rusted cans and machinery , an overturned grindstone , and a large branch , broken by the wind , with shriveled leaves . On the far side of the grove was a barbed-wire fence and beyond it a cornfield . The corn was in tassel . It grew as far as he could see . Mr. Plummer turned and looked at the house in order to be certain of hisalignment . There was no mistake . Acres of yellowing tassels drooped in the sun . Mr. Plummer suddenly flung down his coat and , spreading the middle strand of barbed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he said and walked into the cornfield . He walked through the rows , stooping and looking carefully up and down each row as he crossed it . The stalks were higher than his head . Green silky cars grew tightly against the stalks . Each row was like a sultry tunnel ; there was yellow pollen fallen on the loam . He went on . The tassel grains clung to his perspiring face ; the blades rasped his hands ; his nostrils cloyed with the corn smell . As far as he could see , whichever way he searched , he found only ripening corn , he saw only myriad blades with their sharp hot shadows . When finally he straightened and turned and looked for his direction , barely above the corn he saw the treetops of the grove . It came to him that these were the silver maples from the Nishnabotna bottoms . " Wait , look out , " Tekla said . " Your shirt is caught . " She detached the barb . " You 've got all hot . " Mr. Plummer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his face with his sleeve . The weeds grew few and spindling under the dense trees . " Do you think your mother would Dive us a drink of water , Tekla ? " he said . Tekla opened the back door and brought him into the kitchen . Mrs. Skarstad was ironing . " He wants a drink , " Tekla said . " You get hot . " Mrs. Skarstad leaned over the stove to put an iron back to heat . She detached the handle and picked up another iron . " Sit down and cool off . " Mr. Plummer sat down and laid his hat and coat beside the flyswatter on the oilcloth-covered table . Three cleaned kerosene lamps stood in a row at the end of the table . Tekla filled the graniteware dipper from the water pail and started to bring it to him , but Mrs. Skarstad scolded at her . Mr. Plummer did not understand what she said . Tekla filled a glass with water and gave it to Mr. Plummer . Then she poured him a cup of hot coffee from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the stove and brought him a piece of cake . Tekla sat down across the table from him , talking to her mother in Norwegian , and watched him eat the cake with a fork . " Do you suppose I could telephone to Amaryllis and have a man come and get me with a car ? " Mr. Plummer asked . " It 's too far to walk back . Do you know a man who would drive out and get me for a dollar or two ? " Mrs. Skarstad stopped ironing and spoke to Tekla . As Tekla started out the door Mrs. Skars tad called to her and she came back . Mrs. Skarstad filled a tin pail with hot coffee and Tekla took it with her . " Harold take you , " Mrs. Skarstad said to Mr. Plummer and went on ironing . " Tekla is a good girl , " Mrs. Skarstad said . " Tekla is a very good girl , " Mr. Plummer said . After a pause he asked , " Have you lived here long ? " " Four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " No . " She shook out a nightshirt from the basket and began ironing it . " A man in Minneapolis has it . " There was a pause . " Olas rent . " Mr. Plummer drank the hot coffee slowly . The kitchen had a low ceiling . The boards in the floor were white from scouring . At the far end lay the newly cleaned parts of an unassembled cream separator . Shelves of blue chinaware stood in the wall cupboard . Mrs. Skarstad laid the clothes on a chair as she ironed them . Something in the room , its dimensions , the location of two of the windows , seemed familiar to Mr. Plummer . " Is n't this part of the house older than the rest ? " he said , unintentionally raising his voice . " Sure , " Mr. Skars tad said and pointed with her hand . Mr. Plummer saw that the sill of the door leading into the other part of the house was six inches higher than the floor of the kitchen . He examined the kitchen . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ studding which carried the siding had been unfinished on the inside . Now the walls and ceiling were plastered and papered and the floor , though worn , was not the same . At the far end of the kitchen , behind the separator parts , an open door went into the woodshed . High up in the gable end of the shed he found a small square window dirty with cobwebs . The pane was set immovably into the wall . It was the window by which his bed had lain when as a boy he slept on a platform laid across the ceiling joists . They had called the shelf under the roof an attic . Mr. Plummer came back and sat down by the table again . " I was born in this room , " Mr. Plummer said . " Sure , " Mrs. Skarstad said . " Everything changes . " She lifted the stove lid and put three corncobs into the fire . After a while , Mr. Plummer heard a car starting . He watched from the door and saw Harold with Tckla beside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ double corncrib . Mr. Plummer thanked Mrs. Skarstad and shook hands with Tekla . Harold was sixteen and taciturn . Tekla stood on the running-board to the gate . She swung open the gate and Mr. Plummer said good-by to her again and they drove through . The floorboards shook and rattled under Mr. Plummer 's feet . He did not look back at the farm .
