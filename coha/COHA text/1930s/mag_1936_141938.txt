Last fortnight was an important one for parlor Communists and students of caricature . Two of the ablest satirists in the U. S. published books. * Apart from the artists ' hatred of war and fascism , and unswerving devotion to socialism , neither books nor authors had anything in common . <P> Tall , sober , handsome and immaculately dressed Satirist Grosz was born in Berlin in 1893 , has been a resident of Long Island since 1934 , expects to become a U. S. citizen . Condemned to death as a pacifist during the War , he was let off with front-line service on the Western Front through pressure from Berlin liberals . At the age of 23 he was already a potent figure . He was spared to live through the bitter years of Germany 's civil war and inflation , to draw with biting irregular line the gross Prussian junker , the rise of the Nazis , the swinish profiteer and his fat mistresses . He escaped Nazi concentration camps by going to the U. S. in 1932 to teach at the Art Students @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ burning his books , persistently referring to him as a Jew . Actually George Grosz is as " Aryan " as Hitler . In the U. S. he has continued his biting attack against war and fascism , is proud of his suburban house , his two sons , Peter , 10 , and six-year-old Martin who expects to be a comic-strip artist ( see cut ) , his little coupe , his U. S. clothes , proudest of all of his electric icebox . <P> Sixty-four Grosz drawings and a hand-colored lithograph were presented to a very select public by svelte Publisher Caresse Crosby 's Black Sun Press in an edition of 280 numbered copies , printed on hand-moulded paper , bound in a loose box , introduced by a little essay by myopic Novelist John Dos Passos , and priced at $50 . Among the best drawings : <P> No Echo Here , a clearing in a German pine forest at which a single automobile has stopped . A bandy-legged Nazi with whip dangling from his wrist , canteen and dirk at his belt , is driving a file @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! An emaciated Christ on a crucifix . On his legs German army boots through which the nails have been driven , on his face a gas mask . <P> Just Half a Pound . View of a German butcher 's shop with a thick-legged German hausfrau ordering from a heavily mustached butcher . A female torso hangs from the hooks beside a loin of beef , a trayful of human feet is behind the counter among the sausages .
