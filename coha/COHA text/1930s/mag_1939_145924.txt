Wuthering Heights ( United Artists-Sam Goldwyn ) . " A minor sensation has been caused by the announcement that the Hollywood film version of ' Wuthering Heights ' is to be called Wuthering Heights . . . . The decision . . . was made by no less a person than Mr. Sam Goldwyn . Mr. Goldwyn is a legendary figure who has a fine autocratic way with the English language and chronology and things like that . . . . Still , the title is not everything ; and its retention does not-witness among many others the conspicuous case of Bengal Lancer-at all imply that the film will be even remotely identifiable with the book . " <P> These disdainful words appeared last August in a London Times editorial . Last week they might well have been eaten by their author . As produced by Mr. Goldwyn , directed by William Wyler and acted by Merle Oberon , Lawrence Olivier , David Niven and Flora Robson , Wuthering Heights is not only readily identifiable with the book but one of the season 's distinguished pictures . <P> @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prospect as any book yet pillaged . It is crammed with neurotic , 19th-Century gloom , ridden with implications of incest , short on action , careless of conventional morality . As additional drawbacks , Mr. Olivier , entrusted with the crucial role of Heathcliff , boasts that he dislikes working for the movies and only does it for money ; Ben Hecht and Charles MacArthur , preparing for their labors on Gunga Din , could barely be persuaded to leave their marathon backgammon game long enough to write a script . The script turned out brilliantly . Olivier 's work as Heathcliff is a speaking tribute to the efficacy of the profit motive . <P> Before making the picture , Producer Goldwyn , a stickler for detail , landscaped 540 California acres into a Yorkshire moor . He imported eight British actors , a dialect expert to see that their accents matched , 1,000 panes of hand-blown glass for interior shots and 1,000 heather plants for outdoors . He did not attempt to send for Emily Bronte . In spite of this oversight , there is not much she could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . <P> Man of Conquest ( Republic ) . This week 's addition to the cinema 's rapidly growing biography shelf is a lively portrait of General Sam Houston , Governor of Tennessee ( 1827-29 ) , victor over Mexican General Antonio Lpez de Santa Anna , and President of the Republic of Texas . <P> As a subject for polite , Hays-worthy cinema treatment , Sam Houston presented able Screenwriter Wells Root and his collaborators with notable problems . Houston 's career as Governor was terminated abruptly when , for reasons which have never been completely explained , he left his first wife and the Governor 's mansion almost simultaneously , three months after his marriage . In this picture , Houston ( Richard Dix ) is deserted by his bride and resigns later to spare her unpleasant publicity . The years when he lived among the Cherokee Indians , who called him " Big Drunk , " are glossed over in a few sequences showing him as the red man 's ambassador to his friend , Andrew Jackson . <P> It would take more than such trivial euphemisms to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vitality emerges on the screen as loud as a war whoop and as earthy as the badlands.
