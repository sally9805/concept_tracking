txt Teachers Guild Criticized Borough President Isaacs Tells Stand on Pay Cuts for School Executives To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I was amazed to read the statement of the Teachers Guild in THE TIMES yesterday . It defends those in the higher-salary brackets of the Board of Education who have refused to help the city meet the pressing social needs of the day by accepting the same reduction in their salaries that has been asked of all the other higher-paid city city officials . Frankly , I do not believe that the attitude of the president of the Teachers Guild reflects the attitude of the great rank and file of teachers . Let me recite some pertinent statistics . Superintendent of Schools Harold Campbell receives $25,000 annually or $2,500 more than the 1939-40 salary of the Mayor . Nine deputy and associate superintendents of schools receive $12,500 . Seven examiners of the Board of Education receive $11,000 , as do two additional assistant superintendents , and there are several other administrative salaries at this or slightly higher levels . Sixty senior high school principals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Comparing Salaries For comparison I should like to point out that Park Commissioner Moses , who receives the highest salary among the Commissioners , figures in the new budget at $12,150 . Commissioner Valentine will receive only $11,250 . The salary of Dr. Rice , who devotes extraordinary abilities and experience to the work of the Health Department , will be $9,900 . Dr. Goldwater , in charge of the administration of all of our hospitals , including , of course , the planning and supervision of additional hospital facilities on an unprecedented scale , receives $9,000 . Commissioner Rheinstein , who heads the Department of Housing and Buildings and the Housing Authority , in both capacities receives $9,000 . I submit that the salaries now paid in the upper brackets of the Department of Education are entirely out of line , not only with the salaries of comparable city officials in other departments , but with those whose positions involve far greater responsibility and importance . I believe that those heading the great Department of Education should be the last to place themselves in the same class as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the courts who have refused to reduce their salaries by the 5 or 10 per cent cut that other city officials have accepted  --  particularly when the entire amount saved by such cuts would be devoted to education . Lower Brackets Not Affected It is also somewhat shocking to me to see these officials screen their refusal behind the unwarranted assertion that the request for reductions in the high bracket salaries is a prelude to salary reductions all the way down . In all of the city departments under the full control of the Board of Estimate , the cut that has been made is 5 per cent in salaries from $5,000 upward and 10 per cent in salaries from $10,000 upward . Salaries of those receiving less than $5,000 remain intact , and they have received their usual increments . To prevent any misunderstanding of my own position , I want to restate the following : 1 . I urge a thorough survey of the higher schedules in the Department of Education . Pending this , I will continue to urge a voluntary reduction in the present schedules of 10 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ per cent for those earning $5,000 to $10,000 . This reduction has already been accepted by most city officials and employes 2 . I am opposed to any salary cut for the rank and file of teachers and of the civil service generally . I am in favor of the policy already indicated by the city in other departments  --  that of protecting lower-paid groups , and , in fact , using the reductions in the higher salaries to raise the salaries of low-paid city employes where they are below minimum comparable standards . State Cut Opposed 3 . The city has found itself unable to increase the budget of the Department of Education by $8,000,000 as requested , but it has not actually reduced the budget except by a nominal amount . I am flatly opposed to the State Legislature 's proposed cut in State aid to education . That would involve an actual reduction which I do not believe the department should be made to absorb . 4 . I am guided personally by the belief which I think is supported by the views of all conscientious and progressive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administrative expenses in order that social services may continue . Applied to the Department of Education : If the high-salaried officials accepted the suggested 5 and 10 per cent reductions we would have , according to their own statements , at least $450,000 additional for the 1939-40 education budget . That sum would permit us to retain approximately - 350 permanent substitute teachers next year . Moreover , I should net be at all surprised if the survey I urge would disclose a number of unnecessary highsalary administrative jobs that could be eliminated without any loss to education ? a process which would contribute additional sums for the continuance of essential services . I speak from experience . I have effected very substantial economies in my own office and even managed to put the department on the five-day week without affecting adversely employe morale or causing hardship to any useful city employe . My objective was to enable the city to find the funds so sorely needed for vital social services . All of the members of the Board of Estimate , with the exception of President Harvey and President Lyons , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that end in view . I still entertain the hope that the highbracket administrative officials of the Department of Education will do like- wise . By effecting administrative economies they will be aiding our common cause  --  democratic education . STANLEY M. ISAACS , President , Borough of Manhattan . New York , May 2 , 1939 . Our Educational System Many Faults Found , Including Failure to Give Results Equal to Costs To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : I think it is about time for sensible and enlightened people who are not connected with our educational systems and are therefore not prejudiced to appreciate that a grave flaw and a false concept form the bases on which the structure rests . From a practical standpoint , modern education is predicated . on the false premise that . he who attends an institution of learning longest is best educated . Thus the only solution that educators ever seek to apply in order to eradicate defects in the system is to extend the system of public Instruction . This is accomplished of course at the taxpayers ' expense , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public education . The comprehensive report by an unbiased committee showed rather unflattering results in proficiency in public education , yet nothing has come of this but requests for further appropriations and the extension of existing systems . The tendency today is toward the endless piling up of prerequisites for all positions , public and private , including positions in the teaching profession . The educational systems recognize no experience gained outside their own narrow and prejudiced confines and attempt to reduce all ' , standards to their own mediocre and formal rules and regulations . Adding of Restrictions Selfish persons within the system seek to prevent : honest competition on a basis of ability and to protect their own positions , at public expense , by making it more and more difficult for the individual to qualify . There would be some justification for this selfish attitude if the public interest were benefited , but it is not because the elimination of competent persons by added restrictions which have little or nothing to do with native ability has the effect of lowering standards . The President of the United States @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ calling attention to the prejudice which exists in many lines against the middleaged individual . Certainly , this is one aspect of it . They are forever changing the rules in education circles ; they are forever finding new names for old things and disqualifying all that has gone before . There is a time limit placed upon eligibility and eligible lists , and those who have qualified often find themselves with no opportunity to reestablish eligibility . Do the authorities comprehend the injustice of such an intolerable and unfair situation ? Let those in responsible positions answer this pertinent question . Let them , as public educators , obtain some understanding and experience which are not learned in schools . Let them cease to be smug and understand that educational systems are part of the general scheme of things , and not something apart and divorced from reality . Wants an Accounting When in a neighboring State the teachers were called upon to share a reserve fund for the unemployed , did they demonstrate their unselfishness ? And these persons are . entrusted with the task and great privilege of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ apathetic in matters of this kind , because the majority of persons having had their fill of public schools and institutions are only too happy to escape and forget the whole business or else regard it as hopeless . Are the teachers the leaders of public ) thought really ? Do they contribute their share , as public servants , in defending democratic principles ? A cardinal democratic principle is equal opportunity for all and progress and success on ability . Does the professional attitude of contempt for all who have not completed within the confines of institutions the number of years of school work which they have had speak for a broadminded and democratic viewpoint ? I am critical of public education in its administration and misguided principles . I think most of the world 's troubles come from ignorance and prejudice , and I consider it paradoxical that there should be even a suspicion of those things in education supported by the people . I refer to the situation in general ; it is not what it should be , and the results do not equal the cost . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ account . R. C. O'BiuEN . Arlington , Va. , April 30 , 1939 . Arms Embargo on Japan Urged To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : There seems to be no sound reason for not placing a munitions embargo on Japan . It has been stated many times that the Sino-Japanese conflict could be brought to a close by merely stopping the flow of arms and scrap-iron into Japan . Each day hundreds of Chinese persons are mercilessly killed by bombs made from American scrap-iron , Japanese bombers are powered with motors " Made in U. S. A. " Yet some members of Congress hesitate to pass the Pittman bill which forbids the sale of arms to Japan . ALBERT LEE . New York , , May 2 , 1939.
