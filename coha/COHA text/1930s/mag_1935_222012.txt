THE FACE OF MOTHER INDIA-Katherine Mayo-Harper ( $3.50 ) . <P> The distinction of The Face of Mother India lies in its 406 photographs , covering typical Indian scenes that range from broad panoramas of the Himalayas to pictures of street fighting , of obscene idols , of corpses being burned beside the Ganges . Katherine Mayo supplies a text to accompany these views in a brief , anti-Hindu , over-simplified sketch of Indian history from the Muslim invasion of 999 A. D. to the trials of Mahatma Gandhi in 1935 . Readers who do not share her passionate hatred of Hindu ways are likely to remain unimpressed by her purple prose , her tirades against native terrorists and agitators . Holding that " terrorism " in India is now devoted to the " overthrow of any non-Communist government . . . by multiplication of single murders , by mass killings , " she lists a number of atrocities , suggests that Gandhi 's essential purpose is the extermination of the Muslim population , ends with a fervent plea that Mohammedans may not be provoked to attack the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from this hysterical and somewhat cryptic analysis to the photographs in the volume , readers may get an impression of an India far more serene than Katherine Mayo 's words suggest . Pictures include queer ones of a holy man sitting comfortably on nails , a shot of the spiderweb suspension bridge , made of cane and rattan , that stretches 800 ft. across the Dihang River in Assam . Another holy man , dressed only in covering of thorns and spikes , is pictured twanging away cheerfully on a native banjo , while a holy woman of Benares is shown practicing devotion by staring into the sun without winking . Despite glimpses of temple prostitutes , riot victims , child wives , the gigantic temple car being pulled through the streets , the most dramatic pictures are simple landscapes of the gaunt country around Khyber Pass , inhabited only by fighting men , with troops , tanks and airplanes revolving around a crude sign that reads : " Frontier of India , Travellers Are Not Permitted to Pass .
