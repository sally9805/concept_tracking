txt Representatives of sixteen national securities exchanges meeting here yesterday completed and submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission a broad program calling for revisions and modifications of the nresent methods and rules of regulation . In some cases the program would entail amendments to the Securities Act of 1933 and to the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934 . In others modifications and changes in procedure would accomplish the results which the meeting judged would be beneficial . Broadly speaking the exchange representatives reached this conclusion : That many phases of the present laws and procedure are unduly restrictive , that such restrictions are damming the flow of the capital stream and resulting in thin markets for Securities , and that such results are harmful and not helpful to the investing public . Regulations Too Complex Too much data called for , regulations too complex , duplication of regulations and other phases which burden the issuer and the underwriter with unnecessary expense were pointed out as the committee took up phases after phases of the regulatory set-up , stated its objections and then gave suggested remedies . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ exchange representatives who have been meeting here for two days . called attention to the " thinness " of trading in securities which has resulted " in diversion of some of the business in American securities to foreign markets . " " The general character of exchange markets today Indicates that buyers and sellers are comparatively few . " the letter said . " Whenever the market for outstanding equity securities is thin , it is difficult to raise capital for new Industries or expanding old industries through the medium of this type of security . Whatever tends to deprive markets of healthy buying power delays the day when capital , which is abundant , may flow into industry , which is eager to put to work the manpower now idle . " Many corporations whose securities would ordinarily be listed remain away from exchanges ; the SEC was informed , because of burdens attendant upon registration and restrictions upon officers , directors and large stockholders . Stating that they CIG not intend to attribute the present thinness of the market " wholly to restriction " , the exchanges said their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which " are hampering and restricting the effectiveness of organized securities markets . " " We are convinced . " the exchanges stated , " that it is in the public interest to develop the scope and the effectiveness of the national securities exchanges The open auction markets of the organized exchanges , functioning under federal supervision , afford the best protection to the . public which buys and ' sells securities . Their rules provide that any transactions made by the public will be effected in a free auction market at the best price obtainable at the time . The exchanges said it was their opinion that the " public interest will support fair and reasonable registration requirements under which all corporations having substantial amounts of securities outstanding in the hands of the public would file data reasonably adequate for the information of investors . " " If the burdens or registration by corporations are so reduced as to be counter-balanced by the benefits of disclosure to the public , " the letter states , " we would favor the requiring of the filing of like data by all sizable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ registered corporation for public sale without further formality other than issuance of a simple prospectus , and would qualify them for listing on a national exchange according to the requirements of the exchange itself . " In regard to the problem of private placement of securities , the exchanges asserted that if registration statements were simplified and consolidated as recommended , it " would remove a portion of the incentive now responsible for the growing tendencies of companies " to make such placements . Specific Recommendations The exchange representatives then called for repeal of that part of the Securities and Exchange Act which relates to unfair use of information by insiders and the clarification of the blanket manipulative sections . These sections are 16-B and 9 A-2 , respectively . What has been done in these sections to eliminate abuses has in reality not done so , the report to the SEC said . On the contrary stabilization and sponsorship undertiken in the interest of the investor and in the interest of orderly marketing have been eliminated . Another specific recommendation was amendment of the statute to permit brokers and dealers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ additional issues of securities six months after the offering has been made or at such earlier date as they may be effectively registered with the SEC and admitted to trading on a national securities exchange . The law now bars such extension of credit within a six months period by a broker or dealer who participated in the distribution of a new security as a member of the selling syndicate . Also specifically requested ? Ats amendment of the act to ease securities registration requirements and to accelerate the period in which a registration may become effective . Registrations now becoine effective in 30 days and securities may not be sold until the registrations are effective . Other suggestions were : Simplification of the SEC 's new proxy rules and substantial reduction in data called for . Revision and simplification of forms calling for financial details and disclosure of sales and cost of sales . Formulation of a single registration statement which may be used under both the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 . Revision of provision relating to prospectuses so that if a prospectus @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for members to forward a copy with the delivery of securities purchased on the exchange . The suggestions will meet with a highly mixed reception from the Securities and Exchange Commission , it was indicated last night . However , the conferees expressed optimism over prospects for proposed changes in the two laws being adopted . The commission is almost certain to fight such proposals as repeal of section 16B , unfair use of inside information . This probably will prove equally true in regard to manipulative provisions of the act . While modification of the ' Commission 's new proxy rules may be expected eventually through study of their application , the SEC can be expected to stand by them for the present . On the other hand , such suggestions as simplification of registration statements for use under , both of the securities acts probably will be favored , as will proposals to simplify various " burdensome " / and " unequal " provisions . A committee composed of W. G. Paul , executive secretary of the Los Angeles Stock Exchange ; William B. Long , president of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the St. Louis Stock Exchange , submitted the suggestions and the accompanying letter to Chairman William 0 . Douglas of the SEC . Exchanges subscribing to the recommendations and signing the letter , subject to ratification by their governing boards , follow : Baltimore Stock Exchange , Boston Stock Exchange , Chicago Stock ' Exchange , Cincinnati Stock Exchange , Cleveland Stock Exchange , Detroit Stock Exchange , Loa Angeles Stock Exchange , New Orleans Stock Exchange , . ? New York Cub Exchange , New York Stock Exchange , Philadelphia Stock Exchange , ? Pittsburgh Stock Exchange , St. Louis Stock Exchange , Salt Lake Stock Exchange , San Francisco Stock Exchange , and Washington Stock Exchange . SEC officials stated last night that the technical staff of the commission would be put to work on the suggestions immediately and would be requested to report back at the earliest possible moment . Chairman William 0 . Douglas refused to comment on the exchanges ' action pending a study of the proposals and a report by the staff .             @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
