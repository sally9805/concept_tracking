In New York as in many another big city and in many another crowded profession , Jewish dentists once felt that the clique which managed the local subdivisions of the American Dental Association discriminated against them . Eventually they banded together with similarly distressed Jewish dentists in Newark , Passaic , Westchester County and Montreal and formed the Allied Dental Council . This happened 24 years ago . The Council now has 3,000 members , is conservative , and now admits non-Jews who are not antiSemitic . <P> Last week the Allied Dental Council moved its headquarters from grubby lower Manhattan near Cooper Union to prosperous West 57th Street near Calvary Baptist Church .

This compels the lower jaw to move straight up and down against the upper jaw , instead of in the natural scissors movement . The extra height of the middle teeth prevents Dr. Sears 's patients from shutting their jaws completely . Only way to do that and to bite into food is to thrust out the lower jaw so that the high teeth clear each other . This enables one to nibble . While this process goes on ( practice soon removes the strain ) , the second molars keep the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
