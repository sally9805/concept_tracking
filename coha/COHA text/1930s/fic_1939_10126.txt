to change their clothes and thence to Jackson County to stand trial , Lyman shrugged in his wet garments and spoke in a low voice to Parley . " I hope our men are ready with their rifles . " " Yes , " Parley said . They did not know the extent of the treachery . Tim McBride was soon to learn . After the prisoners had been allowed to change their clothes they were taken to a wagon and there looked beyond the army surrounding them to the village they had helped to build . Tim saw that Joseph was weeping , that Sidney was humped over as if sick ; but Lyman and Parley were defiant . He watched the wagon roll away into the east , surrounded on all sides by the soldiers , and then turned back to the town , wondering when and where the next blow would fall . He did not wonder long . The wagon had hardly disappeared when a general named Clark rode in and arrested fifty-six of the men and sent them posthaste under military guard . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ public square and spoke to them while sitting on his horse . " I am General Clark , " he said . " Colonel Hinkle , your military leader , agreed to four terms to save you from destruction . The first was that you surrender your leaders and this you have done . The second was that you give up your arms . The third was that you sign over your property to pay for the cost of this war . " Clark paused and turned on his horse to look around him . " Another article yet remains for you to comply with , and that is that you leave the State forthwith ; and whatever may be your feelings concerningthis , or whatever your innocence , it is nothing to me . I am here to see that the terms of the treaty are fulfilled . The character of this State has suffered almost beyond redemption from the character , conduct and influence that you have exerted . And we deem it an act of justice to restore her character to its former standing among the States by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thousand men , women and children were listening to him , but in the vast crowd not a person spoke or made a sound . " The orders of the governor to me were that you should be exterminated , and not allowed to remain in the State ; and had your leaders not been given up and the terms of the treaty complied with , before this you and your families would have been destroyed and your homes in ashes . You P201must not think of staying here another season or of putting in crops , for the moment you do this the citizens will be upon you . If I am called here again in case of a non-compliance of a treaty made , do not think I shall act any more as I have done , you need not expect any mercy , but extermination , for I am , determined the governor 's order shall be executed . " As for your leaders do not once think  --  do not imagine for a moment  --  do not let it enter your mind that they will be delivered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their fate is fixed  --  their die is cast . Their doom is sealed . I am sorry , gentlemen , to see so great a number of apparently intelligent men found in the situation you are ; and oh , that I could invoke the Great Spirit , the unknown God , to rest upon you and make you sufficiently intelligent to break that chain of superstition and liberate you from those fetters of fanaticism , with which you are bound , that you no longer worship a man ! " I would advise you to scatter abroad and never again organize yourselveswith bishops , presidents and so forth , lest you excite the jealousies of the people and subject yourselves to the same calamities that have now come upon you . You have always been the aggressors ; you have brought upon yourselves these difficulties by being disaffected and not being subject to rule ; and my advice is that you become as other citizens , lest by a recurrence of these events you bring upon yourselves irretrievable ruin . " You will appoint a committee of twelve to make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white badges on their hats so that in going from place to place their mission will be known . And now , though your leaders have surrendered their arms , it is necessary to search your homes for hidden weapons . " He turned to his soldiers . " Search every home and find every weapon of every kind in this town . " Well , Tim reflected , it could have been worse : they were to be disarmedand driven out with only the clothes on their backs but they were to go in peace . They would never see their leaders again , and those who were not shot or jailed for life would be wanderers on the face of the earth , homeless like the Jews , and with no land to call their own . But they would not be beaten or murdered on their way out of Missouri . He turned away to search for Lucy Ann when he was stopped dead in his tracks by blood-curdling yells ; for a thousand men painted like savages were riding down upon the village . At once there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he could see hisp202people fleeing , with horsemen in mad pursuit , brandishing their guns and knives and clubs , and almost running the women and children down . Some vanished into homes , and others poured out of homes and fled , carrying infants or a few household goods or nothing at all . Such mad confusion Tim had never seen before ; and even so , what he saw was only a small part of what might have been seen in the holocaust of looting and flogging and raping that overwhelmed the village . He ran first to the shack in which Lucy and her people had been living but it was deserted , with a window smashed and a door almost torn from its hinges ; and in rage and fear he went from street to street , looking at the persons fleeing all around him , seeing the mob pour into buildings and stagger out with their arms full of goods , or into homes to steal or destroy what they found there . Nobody paid any attention to him . He was only an unarmed man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and the mobsters , looking in their war paint like Indians , drunk with whiskey or triumph , yelling and fighting among themselves to possess the loot , cared nothing about a man who dashed anxiously from street to street , looking for a face . Nov and then he paused to stare at men laden with the goods they had filched . If he saw a fleeing girl he pursued her until close enough to learn that she was not Lucy Ann ; and then set off again , racing like a madman , with sweat pouring down his face and breath scalding his lungs . He had searched for an hour when upon the threshold of a house he stopped in amazement . There were several men in the room and a woman ; and in one swift glance , Tim grasped the whole scene and realized what was being done . He saw the naked woman bound to a bed and the men around her ; and in this moment Tim went mad . Springing forward he struck with all his might at the man embracing the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the floor . He came out of darkness and pain , groping for light and meaning and trying to sit up and look around him . There was a sudden thrust of pain in his skull like the entrance of a knife ; and when he raised a hand to his hair he felt the blood in it and moved his fingers around an open wound . With horror and rage he remembered now , but when he strove to rise he fell back and darkness closed around him again . A little later he was dimly aware of men bending over him and tearing his shirt off ; and still later , when the blows of a whip fell , he was hardly consciousp203of the pain . How long they flogged him he could never have told , nor did he know when they left . How long he lay here naked in his own blood he never knew . When again he could see and think , there was darkness around him , though whether of his pain or the night he could not be sure until he crawled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stars . After a while he could hear voices and feet ; but the effort to learn if they were of friend or enemy overcame him and he fainted and lay still . In the days that followed he was in a strange house and Lucy Ann was his nurse . He lay on his stomach because his back was a welter of wounds and bruises . He wanted to talk . He wanted to know what had happened and if the prophet was dead ; but when he strove to speak , Lucy closed his mouth for him and told him to hush . " Do n't talk yet . " she said . He reached out to touch her and she gave him one of her hands . He looked at her face and thought she was thinner and whiter than she had been . One day he said : " Lucy Ann , you must tell me what happened . Is Joseph dead ? " " I do n't know . I guess he is . " " Did they shoot him ? " " I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ order to General Doniphan . " " An order to what ? " " To take Joseph and the others in the public square and shoot them . But General Doniphan said it was cold-blooded murder and he would n't . " " God bless him . What did they do then ? " " They took Joseph away . " " Where am I ? In Far West ? " " Yes . You must n't talk any more now . " " I guess they beat me , did n't they ? " " I should n't think you 'd need to ask that . " " Did they beat all our men ? " " No , just a few . Do n't talk any more now . " " What are the saints doing ? " " Oh , getting ready to leave . " He turned a little to gaze at her . " Did they  --  " He hardly knew how to ask the question . He looked down at her body , wondering if she had been ravished . " Did they treat you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a field . While I was hiding , some men they came out and shot all the horses and cows . They just shot them and rode away . " " Did they shoot all the cattle we have ? " " No , just some of it . " " Lucy Ann , who is our leader now ? " " We do n't have any , Tim . They arrested all the leaders and took them away . " " But not Brigham Young . Did they find him ? " " I do n't think so . But we do n't know where Brigham is . " Tim was thoughtful a long while . " I must get well , " he said . " We must find Brigham Young . "  | WHEN JOSEPH WAS HAULED AWAY UNDER GUARD WITH HIS COMPANIONS he was so depressed that he did not speak at all during the first day 's journey ; but in the camp on Crooked River he slept well and felt new hope and strength when morning came . After they set forth again , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , saying the Lord had made Himself known during the night . " The Lord told me our lives will be saved . " " He did ? " cried Rigdon . Parley said : " That makes me feel all right . I can face anything now . " Lyman believed too that the Lord had spoken but it was his way to depend on his own prowess . He was hatching plots . " Did the Lord say , " Rigdon asked , " where they 're taking us ? " " No . He only said our lives will be spared . " Over Rigdon 's large bloodless face came a smile of joy and peace . " Glory be to God ! " he said , and looked around him at the guards , and at General Wilson who was in charge . Seeing his stare , Wilson rode up to the wagon . " How are you ? All right ? " " I guess so , " Parley said . Wilson looked kind and jolly but he was inordinately proud to have these men in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saints out of Independence four years ago . He gazed at them now as if they were a small menagerie of unusual beasts . " Why did you come back to Missouri anyhow ? " " Because , " said Joseph , " the Lord commanded it . " " Oh , the Lord did ! He seems to want to keep you in a peck of misery all the time . " " Righteousness , " said Rigdon , feeling bolder because his life was to be spared , " has always been persecuted . The Savior was crucified . " Wilson grinned at that . What sort of men these prisoners were hep206could not for the life of him tell . " Why did n't you go to some State where you could live in peace ? " " In peace ! " Lyman roared . He was annoyed by this paunched fellow who not long ago had been only a storekeeper . " Where have the righteous ever found peace in all the years of man ? " Wilson sighed and considered . " What makes you think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's big face looked full of indignation and sermon . Had he not predicted on the last Fourth of July that the saints would so completely exterminate their enemies that blood would dye mountain and prairie from ocean to ocean ? Yet here he was , being hauled in a wagon under heavy guard as if he were a common scoundrel ! " Sir , " he said , " people everywhere are lost in sin . It is a thieving , lying , blasphemous world . Our church is the right church , the only true church , the only church through which souls can be saved . If we are more righteous than other people , it is by God 's will . " Wilson threw a leg over his horse 's neck and grinned at Rigdon . " You seem to be mighty sure of yourself . " " We are . We 'd be fools not to be when we have a prophet who talks with God . " Joseph did not like Sidney 's loud and pompous declarations . He lay back in the wagon and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I suppose you 're taking us somewhere to hang us . " " Oh , no . I 'm taking you to stand trial . " " Trial for what ? " " Probably for treason . " " Treason ! " Rigdon bellowed . " Sir , treason for what ? " " For rebellion , " said Wilson , still gazing curiously at the men . " You 've thrown half of Missouri into civil war . " " Because we defend our rights you call it civil war . What about the mobs who beat our men and attacked our women ? " It was Lyman speaking . He was angry . Before Wilson could answer , Joseph said : " Brother Lyman , do n't speak with so hot a temper . It does no good . " " Women , " said Wilson , " were attacked by Mormon mobsters . Your Danites tortured and murdered and raped . " " It 's a lie ! " Rigdon cried . ,  |p207Jose|ph  sat up and looked at the general . " The Danites were no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretended to be saints . They have been expelled . " " It 's high time . " After a moment Wilson added : " Where 's your leader named Brigham Young ? " " Oh , " cried Lyman witheringly , " has n't the state of Missouri with its thousands of armed bandits been able to catch him ? Brigham is too smart to be betrayed by a Judas like Hinkle  --  or to be captured by all the hellhounds you can muster . " " We 'll find him , " said Wilson calmly . " We 'll hang him . " " I predict , " said Rigdon , half-rising and looking as leonine as he could , " I predict that you 'll hang none of us . God is guarding us , not your bandits . " " We 'll see about that , " said Wilson . " As for Brigham Young , I predict we 'll have him in twenty-four hours . " " If you catch Brigham , " said Lyman , " you can take me out to a public square @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll shoot you . And the trial wo n't take long . Just be patient . " And Wilson grinned at them and rode to the head of his troops . Long before they saw the town , the prisoners knew they were going to Independence . Lyman said they were taking them back to the mobs that once chased him from hell to breakfast ; but Joseph told him to be comforted , that God would protect them day and night . Lyman said he preferred to protect himself , and wished he had the army of desperate men whom he was leading a few days ago . The prisoners were not delivered to a mob . They were hauled up and down the streets of Independence as if they were strange animals brought from a jungle ; and hundreds of persons fell into line to stare at them . Though a few jeered , the saints were surprised to see so many friendly and sympathetic faces . Indeed , after spending two days and nights in a dirty cell with only a floor for a bed , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ move freely , with only a few guards to watch them . Most of the persons with whom they talked were friendly . Some , like an old , gray woman , wanted to know if Joseph pretended to be the Lord . " No , " he said , " I am only mortal man . " " You do n't think you 're God ? " " I am a man sent here by God to preach the gospel . "  |p208She  was disappointed . All sorts of men preached all sorts of gospel . " But do n't you cast out devils ? " " I have cast out a few , " said Joseph . " If , " said Rigdon , " he cast all the devils out of human beings he 'd have to work twenty-four hours a day and be ten thousand men . " She looked at Rigdon . " Are you a prophet too ? " " Well , " he said uneasily , " I 've done a little predicting . But Joseph is the only real prophet among us . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ asked , turning to Parley . " Oh , " he said , grinning broadly , " I just preach some and try to mind my own business . " She gazed from one to another of the four men , disappointed in allof them . " I thought , " she said at last , " you Mormons had horns . " " We did have , " said Lyman scathingly . " The bandits knocked them off . " " We are , " said Joseph , " only ordinary men . " She decided they were , and so did others who talked with them . The townspeople , as a matter of fact , were so friendly that Wilson with difficulty found three men who would volunteer to take the prisoners to Richmond for trial ; and these , more interested in whiskey than in guardianship , got dead drunk the first night out and gave their arms to the prisoners . " This is our chance , " said Lyman , looking at the drunken guards sprawled on the earth . " No , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not run . " " Mebbe , " said Lyman impatiently , " this is the Almighty 's way of helping us . He let the guards get drunk so we can escape . " But Joseph would not budge , and Sidney and Parley could not prevail against him . The next day they resumed the journey , and the guards looked at them with sly astonishment , as if wondering why they had not fled . In Richmond they were thrust into a deserted house and padlocked ankle to ankle with a huge chain . The charges against them , they were told , were treason , murder , arson , larceny , theft and stealing . Early one morning General Clark came to them with several men . He pointed to the chained prisoners and said : " Gentlemen , you shall have the honor of shooting the Mormon leaders on Monday morning at eight o'clock . "  | " Fine ! " said one of the men ; and they all loaded their rifles with two balls each . After the men had gone , Lyman gazed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us a chance to escape . Now we 'll be shot . " " No , " said Joseph , " we 'll not be shot . " Sitting on a rude bench , chained ankle to ankle , the four men were silent until Lyman became aware that all was not right with Sidney . He turned to look at him and was appalled ; for beyond all doubt the man was insane . Since the night when he writhed in convulsions , Sidney had behaved queerly , his lucid intervals alternating with slobbering madness ; and now , after hearing that he was to be shot on Monday , he broke again and rolled his eyes and drooled . Lyman was chained next to him and tried to move away ; but unexpectedly Rigdon threw his long arms around Lyman and gave a terrible yell that brought the guards on the run . Seeing one of the prisoners behaving so , a guard cried by the holy angels that there was a devil in the man , and forthwith procured a long stick and thrust at Rigdon . When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his own flesh . The guards liked this scene . They entered the dungeon and sat on their heels and howled with laughter . " Look at him ! " cried one . " He 's as crazy as a bat ! " He thrust again wits the stick and Sidney gave a roar of insanity and grief . Laughing until tears washed their cheeks , the guards rocked shoulder to shoulder or leaned forward to gaze at Rigdon and poke him again , His eyes luminous with hate , Lyman stared at the tormentors ; but Joseph and Parley looked beyond them , trying not to see or hear . One of the men was annoyed by Lyman 's contempt . " You know what we done ? " he asked . " I 'll tell you . You know how many of your babies ' brains we knocked out against trees ? " " And what we done to your women ! " " I'n preach that lick-spittle a sermon , " said one of the guards , rising to his feet . " Listen , you paddies and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and hard-heads and hawkeyes , greenhorns and Whigs , rackensacks and masons , you call us Missourians pukes ! Well , I 'll tell you . We drink brandy-rovers and gin-jumpers and **25;6024;TOOLONG whiskey punches ; but we do n't fall into fits ! " " Shut your jib , " said one of his companions and dragged the manp210down . " I want a-tell these pot-soppers what we done to their women . You know Mary Kenyon ? " " Let 's tell them some dirty stories to cheer them up . You want a-hear some dirty stories , you Mormon snags ? " Lyman was gazing with such vindictive hatred that one of the guards , momentarily abashed , seized the stick and thrust at him . " Do n't look at me that way or I 'll poke your eyes out ! " " Poke that ringtail roarer again . I like to hear him yell . " " No , let 's tell them some dirty stories . " " Let 's tell what we done to Mary Kenyon . How many of us was there ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with his chains clanking and shook his clenched hands at the guards . " Silence ! " he thundered . " Ye fiends out of the infernal pit ! In the name of Jesus Christ I rebuke you and command you to be still ! Stop this vile talk or you or I will die this instant ! " Astounded by the wrathful majesty of the man , the guards rose hastily to their feet . They looked at one another and then retreated to the door and looked at Joseph ; and then step by step they withdrew from the dungeon until only one face was visible . This face peered in but after a moment it disappeared . Joseph sank slowly to the bench . Two days later the prisoners were brought to trial . Joseph had hoped to appear before an impartial court but as soon as he saw the face of judge King , of Tom Birch , the prosecuting attorney , and of the assembledwitnesses , he knew he could expect no justice here . Both judge and attorney looked triumphant . But this was not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an investigation . The charges were murder , larceny , arson , theft and treason ; and day after day for two weeks , witnesses testified against them . The first to appear was Ike Gibbs , a tall gaunt farmer from the Crooked River area . " Mr. Gibbs , do you know the prisoners ? " " I kallate I do . " " Do you know any good about them ? " " Dog on it , no , not a thing . " " Were you present during the murders on Crooked River ? " " I was there but I was a-runnun for my life most of the time . " " Were any of the prisoners on the scene of the murders ? "  | " One , " said Gibbs , peering in turn at the prisoners . " Which one ? " " Him there . " He pointed at Parley . " Any others ? " " Not as I'n be sure about . " " Was this man there ? " asked Birch , indicating Joseph . " I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He stared at Joseph long and earnestly . " But him , mebbe he was . " He pointed at Rigdon who , white and drooping , looked as if he lived between vomiting and prayer . Now and then the judge interrupted to say , " You prisoners will have to get your witnesses here to testify for you  --  if you have any . " After the statement was made a fourth time , Lyman rose in fury . " Witnesses ! You throw our witnesses in jail as fast as they show up ! " " Silence ! " The judge turned to the clerk . " Write that down . It 's a strong point for treason . " General Doniphan , the man who had refused to execute the prisoners , had volunteered to represent them . He now rose . " What good will witnessesdo my clients ? If a cohort of angels were to come down and declare these men innocent , you would jail them anyway . " Judge King reddened and thumped his desk . Hyrum Smith had been arrested and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in with them for the investigation . When one forenoon he saw a Mormon brother peering into the courtroom , Hyrum beckoned to the man to enter , and then addressed the judge . " Your honor , we have a witness here and he is ready to be sworn . " " Where ? " " Here , " said Hyrum , and pushed the man forward . " I object , " said the prosecutor . " This is not a trial . We are investigating the prisoners to see if evidence will sustain the charges . There is no point Doniphan rose and cut him short . " I 'll be damned if the witness is not sworn ! It 's a shame to treat these defendants in this manner . They are not allowed to put a single witness on the stand . The witnesses they have sent for have been captured by force of arms and thrown into the bull pen . Is this an investigation or a farce ? " " An investigation , " said Birch calmly . " Well , by God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | " Very well , " said the judge . The man was sworn but he had answered only one question when a huge rowdy leapt forward and grasped him by the nape of the neck and the seat of the trousers and kicked him bodily out of the courtroom . In towering rage , Doniphan was on his feet again ; but the witness was fleeing for his life before the amazed general fully realized what had happened . " Your honor , " he bellowed , " what kind of a God damned farce is this ? I demand the expulsion of this scoundrel from the room ! " " You 'd better leave , " said the judge . The big fellow left but he looked back through the doorway and grinned . Doniphan mopped his brow . " What 's the use of my calling witnesses if they 're to be thrown out on their faces ? " " The investigation will proceed , " said the judge , addressing Birch . The prosecution called a man who was once a Mormon but now an apostate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ question the man himself . " Mr. Witness , is it true that Mormons send missionaries to foreign countries ? " " Yes , sir . " " Do the Mormons profess a belief in the seventh chapter of Daniel , the twenty-seventh verse ? " " They do . " The judge turned to the clerk . " Put that down . That is a strong point for treason . " And day after day the investigation proceeded . Most of the witnesses were apostates or members of the gangs in Daviess County ; and when the evidence was all in , the prisoners stood guilty of every major crime except rape . But the most amazing incident came a little later . In summingup , Birch was so violent that he made himself sick with rage and eloquence . Suddenly breaking off in his harangue , he looked for a momentas if he would scream , and then vomited almost at the feet of the horrified judge . The distressed man doubled over and heaved out of convulsed sickness and straightened and wiped his mouth . " Your honor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was stricken again . Parley Pratt could not restrain a chuckle ; but the other prisoners , used to anything now , looked very solemn and waited . " Your honor , " said Birch , gazing with appalled eyes at the floor , " I need a few moments to recover . " After Birch had finished , the bold Doniphan rose again to his feet . Hep213was being assisted by Pete Burnett who wore a pistol ; and before Doniphan rose , Burnett said to him : " Let yourself go . I 'll shoot the first man who attacks you . " And while Burnett sat with a cocked pistol , Doniphan let himself go . " Your honor , " he said , " this court has spent two weeks trying to fasten every crime in the calendar upon the prisoners . You have called apostates and mobsters , scoundrels and thieves , horsewhippers and house-burners . You have called only persons who hate the Mormons and all that they stand for . You have tried to show that they are guilty of pillage and arson , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attempt to show that they were law-abiding citizens who were protecting their property and defending their rights . " Doniphan observed that Judge King had turned pale . He observed that persons crowded into the courtroom looked as if they were ready to mob him ; and he heard their low hisses and jeers . But Pete Burnett was sitting with his pistol cocked . Doniphan spoke again ; and his hot temper got the best of him and rode in withering sarcasm upon his words . " You have proved nothing except a wish to have the lives of these men . You have proved nothing except that the Constitution of the United States has no place in this courtroom or in the judge who presides over it . First , last and all the time , you have sniffed hungrily at every lie , every false charge , every abominable heresy that tends to fasten the crime of treason upon Joseph Smith and his followers . That is justice , that is impartial investigation , that is the honor of Missouri as you represent them ! " He stepped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drew close to Judge King and shook a fist at him ; and when a man in the crowd moved forward , Burnett turned to him and showed his cocked pistol . " Go on ! " Burnett said . " Your honor , my forefathers and yours came to this country two centuries ago to escape injustice and tyranny . They came to build a great and free nation . They fought a bloody war in defense of their principles , and drew up a charter to govern free men , and that charter is today the noblest document in history 's annals . But you  --  you , forgetting why our grandfathers fought and died , forgetting why and by whom this great nation was founded , forgetting everything but prejudice and tyranny and injustice  --  you , sir , have chained these men in dungeons and refused them bail ! You have planted spies in the dungeon with them ! You have allowed guards to torture them , taunt them , tell them foul stories , insultp214them , and heap upon them every abuse that degraded men can think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had them thrown into dungeons . You have allowed men to testify against them who have openly boasted of murdering their children and raping their wives ; men who have told of taking Negresses out into the woods and of what they did to them there ; men who have burned their homes and stolen their property , men who have sworn to neither eat nor drink until Joseph Smith is dead ! That is the kind of justice found in this courtroom in Richmond in Missouri ! That is the kind of farce you have allowed while newspapers all over this nation are crying out indignantly against what you have done ! " " Stop him ! " a man cried , and in an instant , fifty men had risen to their feet . Pete Burnett swung to face them . " Stay where you are ! I 'll drop the first man who moves ! " He turned to Doniphan . " Go on , General . " " Your honor , " said Doniphan , again speaking quietly , " when General Lucas commanded me to shoot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I refused . I said it would be cold-blooded murder . I risked court martial . But I 'll dare court martial again before I see men shot down like rats in a free country . I 'll give my life before I 'll see you make a travesty of the principles our forefathers died for . These men , these prisoners before you , are not guilty of larceny or murder or treason . They are guilty of nothing except an effort to protect the homes they built . There has been no treason . There has been no killing except in self-defense . And I say to you before Almighty God that if you do not free them , if you do not let them go back to their wives and children , if you do not allow them to go peacefully out of this state , then your name will go down in history with that of Benedict Arnold as a traitor to the principles which Americans love ! Your name will stink in the records , and be a shameful thing on the tongue of every child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : in the name of a just God , let justice be done ! " After this denunciation , the judge was as pale as the prosecutor who had sat throughout with his gaze on Doniphan 's angry face . The spectators stirred , ready for attack ; but Judge King saw their eagerness and rose to his feet . " The evidence , " he said , speaking thickly , " is sufficient to hold the prisoners for trial for treason . The guards will take them back to the jail . "  |p215PARLEY  WAS KEPT IN THE RICHMOND JAIL , BUT JOSEPH , SIDNEY ANDLyman , together with Joseph 's brother Hyrum and a man named McRae , were taken to the Liberty jail in Clay County . This small stone building , with two tiny windows set high in the thick wall , seemed to Joseph more like a tomb than a prison ; and he smiled bitterly when he looked around him and remembered its name . He still believed that God would set them free , but Lyman decided that if they were ever to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He became convinced of this after Sidney was allowed to escape . For Rigdon , since his arrest , had been violently insane so many times that he had wasted to skin and bone . " They let him escape , " said Lyman . " That means they do n't think they'n convict us and would be glad to get rid of all of us . " " No . They were afraid Sidney would die in jail . " " We can get out if we set our minds to it . Hyrum , what do you think ? " Hyrum was a gentler image of his brother , a fair and superstitious young man given to visions and dreams . He now turned his haunted blue eyes on Joseph . " If the prophet says we 'll be freed , then we will be . " " I imagine , " said Lyman scornfully , " God would like to have us help a bit . Alex , " he said , speaking to McRae , " what do you think ? Are we going to sit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food until we are too weak to crawl ? We 'll have leprosy next . I feel as if I 'd been born in a stable and fed with the pigs . " Joseph looked up at a small square of light . " I wish , " he said , " that all the mobocrats of the nineteenth century were in the middle of the sea , in a stone canoe , with an iron paddle ; and that a shark would swallow the canoe and then be thrust into the bottom of hell , and the door locked and the key lost , with a blind man hunting for it . "  |p216That  outburst made Lyman grin . " We'n get out of here . In fact , if we just dash out and run I do n't think anyone would stop us . " " We could try it , " said McRae . " They might shoot us but they intend to anyhow . " " For shame ! " said Joseph . " God has told me our lives will be spared . " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like it better if we help ourselves . " Lyman so persistently urged flight that the other men resolved to run with him for their lives ; and one evening , when the meal was brought , they all bolted through the door . A half-dozen guards aimed cocked rifles at their heads and ordered them back ; and back they went , scampering like wild beasts from a yard to a kennel . " You want your heads blowed off ? " asked a guard , looking in . " We do n't like this mansion , " said McRae dryly . " The rug is too thick and the chairs are too soft and the food is making us fat . " The guard grinned . " The food is some of your Mormon beef . " Another guard stepped up . " Which one of you bastards killed my brother on Crooked River ? " McRae 's long face broke into a sardonic grin . " A hundred men have asked us who killed their brothers and sons and fathers on Crooked River . I 'm sorry to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Some mouth-almighty Mormon shot my brother . Was it you ? " " If it was , I suppose that 's the reason I 'm in a jail called liberty . I think I 'll stretch out on my soft couch and take a nap . " " Oh , your soft couch ! " The guard peered in at the unclean floor of stone . " How would you like a nice feather pillow ? " " And some strawberries and cream ! " " Or a bunch of roses to smell the place up nice . " " If we had any more comfort we 'd get lazy . Take this mattress out and let me sleep on the floor . " " Your mattress ! " cried the guard , looking again at the cold stone . He looked at McRae and grinned . " You ai n't so damned bad . You'n joke about it . " He stared at Lyman . " Hey , you the one who told General Wilson to shoot and be damned ? " " He 's the one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gets out of here , " said McRae , " you 'd better leave the country . He 'll roast your thick skull in a bake oven . "  | " Listen , you snags and griddle-greasers ! When you leave here it will be for the firing squad . You 're all as good as dead . " " Fine ! " McRae cried . " I 'd rather sleep in a coffin than in a jail called liberty . " The guards liked that . They gazed at McRae and pondered . " Mebbe , " said one , " it wo n't be a coffin . Just a hole in the ground . " " At least it will be clean . " " This does smell rotten , " said a guard , sniffing . " Here , hand your pots out and I 'll scrub them up for you . " Plotting escape , Lyman spent a part of his time quietly tunneling through the deep foundation of a wall . He used his hands to dig , or with a piece of stone he chipped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Though McRae encouraged him , nobody assisted in the labor . Nobody paid much attention except Hyrum whose fair face was constantlyalive with fear . Joseph believed God would deliver him ; and though he weakened day by day under the foul air , the stone he slept on , the unclean food he ate , he gave his mind , nevertheless , to plans for rebuilding his church . Now and then one of the saints outside was allowed to talk with him . Tim McBride came . " Do n't you want me to get you out of here ? " he asked , peering into the dungeon . " How ? " Lyman said . " I 'll raise an army . " " With cornstalks for guns ! " cried McRae . Tim had forgotten that all the rifles had been confiscated . He scratched his dirty head and considered . " I could try . " " No , " said Joseph . " Brother Timothy , what are my people doing ? " " Freezing and starving to death  --  and getting ready to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Brigham Young . " " That is well . Brigham is a great man . " " At least , " said Tim , " he never gets arrested . " " Was all our livestock killed ? " " No , just some of it . " " Where is Brigham moving to ? " " I do n't know . He has some place in mind . "  | " Did Sidney Rigdon get back alive ? " " Yes , but he sure acts queer . And , dodgast it , was he mad ! He says all our enemies will be murdered yet . " " He talks too much , " said Lyman . " Tell him to shut up . " " Take , " said Joseph , " this message to my people . " The message was an exhortation to peace and patience . " Tell them the prophet and his companions are compelled to hear nothing but blasphemous oaths , and witness a scene of blasphemy , and drunkenness and hypocrisy , and debaucheriesof every description . But tell them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But the patience which Joseph commanded , he himself after a few weeks could no longer assume ; and one night he rose suddenly and cried out in agony of soul . " 0 God , where art thou ? And where is the pavilion that covereth thy hiding place ? How long shall thy hand be stayed , and thine eye , yea thy pure eye , behold from the eternal heavens the wrongs of thy people , and of thy servants , and thine ear be penetratedwith their cries ? Yea , 0 Lord , how long ! " The other prisoners sat up to look at him and to listen ; and after a few moments , Hyrum moved over to Lyman and put a trembling arm around him . Joseph was speaking again . " My son , peace be unto thy soul ; thine adversity and thine afflictions shall be but a small moment ; and then , if thou endure it well , God shall exalt thee on high ; thou shalt triumph over all thy foes . " He was silent , his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " If thou shouldst be cast into the pit , or into the hands of murderers , and the sentence of death be passed upon thee , if thou be cast into the deep , if the billowingsurge conspire against thee , if fierce winds become thine enemy , if the heavens gather blackness , and all the elements combine to hedge up the way ; and above all , if the very jaws of hell shall gape open the mouth wide after thee , know thou , my son , that all these things shall give thee experience , and shall be for thy good ! The Son of man bath descended below them all : art thou greater than He ? " After waiting as if to learn if God would speak again , Joseph slowly sank to the stone floor and bowed his head . A half-hour passed before Lyman spoke . " I thought God told you He would set us free . "  | " He did . Just now He spoke like we might all be condemned to death . " " That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know as much as I do . You heard Him . " " In that case , " said Lyman angrily , " I might as well get back to my digging ! " And a few days later , he had the tunnel ready for the removal of the last stone . Tonight , he said , they would run for their lives ; for they might as well be shot running as standing against a stone wall . McRae crawled over on hands and knees to look at the hole : it was , he decided , large enough for Joseph to worm through , and Joseph was the largest man here . " How long will it take to finish it ? " " Just a minute . I just have to move that one rock . " The men sat close to the tunnel and waited . When they heard personsmoving around the jail outside , they thought the tunnel had been discovered ; but in a few moments the feet went away and there was silence . " About two in the morning will be best @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drunk . " " You think we can escape ? " asked Hyrum anxiously . " We'n try , " said Lyman . " There 's no use to stay here till they shoot us . McRae moved over to Joseph who was leaning against a wall as if asleep . " Joseph , shall we try it ? " " Yes , " said Joseph wearily . " Perhaps it is God 's will . " McRae crawled back to Lyman and whispered : " He is willing . " The men waited . Now and then they could hear a drunken guard cursing , but except for outbursts of profanity , the world beyond was as silent as the dungeon in which they sat . " I wonder what time it is . " " Not midnight yet . " " If I could see the big dipper , " said McRae , rising and trying to look through one of the small windows . He was peering out when , with suddenness so sharp it was like thunder , there was a terrific yowl of astonishment and rage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lungs out.  | " Good God ! " said Lyman , staggering to his feet . " They 've discovered it ! " " Sounds like it , " said McRae . Joseph and Hyrum rose and the four men stood together in the cell , listening to the howls of fury outside . In a moment the door was opened and a dozen gleaming musket barrels were thrust inside . " You sons-of-bitches ! " a man roared . " What you been doing in there ? " " Do n't shoot ! " Joseph cried . Lyman stepped forward . " Shoot and be damned ! " He looked down the barrels at angry faces . " We 're only rats in a hole . We 've been here for months so go ahead and murder us . " " Back ! " said a man , and waved the guns aside . " So you intended to escape , you dodrotted Mormon pot-soppers ! Watch them , men , while I go inside . " The guard entered and went over to the wall to examine it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ peer in . " Who done that ? " " I did , " Lyman said . " For a cent I 'd blow your skull off . " " Do it ! " cried Lyman furiously . " You think I want to live like a rat in this stinking place all my life ? Why in hell do n't we have a trial ? If we are to be cooped up until we rot , then shoot us ! " The guard looked at him and considered . " I do n't blame you a hell of a lot . Here , men , get busy and fix that hole . " The other guards went away but the leader remained , rifle in hand , peering into the cell . " Do n't you try any more of them tricks . I wo n't shoot you this time but I will next time . " " If , " said McRae , " you want to shoot us standing you 'll have to do it pretty soon . In another week you 'll have to prop us up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and grin . " Oh , we'n prop you , all right . Or we'n shoot you in the back of your head while you lay on your bellies . " " That 's about the way you 'll do it , " said Lyman scornfully . " Give me a gun and I 'll come out and fight the whole drunken bunch of you . " " Do n't get impatient . You 'll be shot soon enough and I 'll be there to see it . " " You pack of gin-jumping blasphemers ! " Hearing a sound behindp221him , Lyman turned . He saw Hyrum on hands and knees , doubled over and vomiting . The tunnel was filled with huge stones and a guard was posted there day and night ; but Joseph did not yield his faith and hope . During the next weeks , while the others sat like dead men , their spirits almost broken and their hope gone , he gave the long hours to thought , reflectingon the way his people had been scattered , wondering if he could rebuild his kingdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomeapostates , including many of the leaders ; and of others who cursed him for a false prophet and said they would lynch him if he ever got out . Oliver Cowdery and Dave Whitmer and Martin Harris had denouncedhim and been excommunicated  --  and John Whitmer and Orson Hyde had gone , and even the gentle Edward Partridge . They could all desert , but he would remain steadfast and God would be with him . He still believed in the beauty of the human body , the dignity of the human personality , the power of the human mind . Every person was a child of God , no matter how sinful or weak or degraded ; and God had given to him the simple truths with which an erring humanity could be saved . That was his message ; that was his church . He thought too , while sitting day after day in this dark dungeon , of the millions of souls waiting for birth  --  waiting on the evils that producedbarren women and harlots ; or waiting on the selfishness of those who wished to have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He abhorredthe sterile wicked waste of prostitution in which women sold their beauty and youth and did nothing to hasten the millennium . The pilgrimage of spirits through birth and their earthly journey , and then through death and resurrection , needed quickening , needed larger families ; and again he thought of Abraham and the other ancients and wondered how long it would be until he received a revelation on this matter . That a revelation would come he did not doubt . It was absurd for a man of his vitality and health and genius to have only one wife , or to have only a few children when there could be a hundred bearing his name .... " Brother Lyman , " he said unexpectedly one day , " we shall soon be free . " " How do you know that ? "  | " God is making His will known . " " I wish the Almighty would hurry . We 're wasting time . " " Are you sure ? " asked Hyrum , raising his white emaciated face . " Yes , Hyrum . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ certainly a bunch of fine patriarchs , " said McRae , fingering his long dirty beard . He gazed at the other men and grinned . Lyman had a dense crop of whiskers that almost covered his face , but Joseph 's and Hyrum 's were a thin growth , and looked more like fair foliage of silk . The hair of all the men fell upon their shoulders . A week later the time came , but not in the way Joseph had expected . The men were removed from the dungeon and told that they were to be sent to another jail in Richmond . " What for ? " asked McRae . " To stand trial for murder and treason . " " To be ambushed and shot , you mean . " Stiffly , blinking in the strong light , and looking like wild men out of a jungle , the prisoners mounted horses and rode away , with guards ahead of them and behind them . The time was early April . All winter they had lain on a floor of stone . Their hair and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them in foul rags ; and their bodies had wasted away until they were only grotesque skeletons of what they had been . Joseph looked around him at the beauty of earth and filled his lungs . He heard birds and saw wild flowers ; gazed at the limpid loveliness of streams and breathed the fragrant April air until he felt drunk ; and felt so happy that he began to sing . Lyman gave little attention to the glory of the world . He was plottingto escape ; but on the journey to Richmond , he found no chance to flee or to get hold of a gun ; nor later when the prisoners were arraigned before Tom Birch , the prosecutor at the first trial who was now a judge . The witnesses against them by day were the men who guarded them by night . The grand jury returned indictments for treason , murder , arson , theft and stealing ; and when Joseph asked for a change of venue to Marion County , he was granted one to Boone . When , with a sheriff and three @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyman believed their opportunity had come . Joseph , he reflected , angered by the man 's patience , seemed willing to stand trial , believingp223that God would set him free . Lyman resolved that there would be no trial for him : he would escape or be shot now . The sheriff and his assistants had several flasks of whiskey with them and drank freely and sang as they took their way over the rolling hills . One of the guards , a red-faced bewhiskered man named John Hogarth , seemed very friendly . Now and then he rode up to the wagon to jest with the prisoners . " How you feeling ? You ready to be shot ? " " Shot , hell ! " Lyman cried . The sardonic McRae added : " There 's nothing in us to shoot . We 've dried up so in dungeons that bullets would go right through us and never bother us at all . " " We 'll take care of that , " said Hogarth , still grinning . " We 'll blow you to pieces with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Lyman aside . " Why , " he asked , " do n't you fellows escape ? " " How ? " asked Lyman suspiciously . " Well , tonight we might all get as slewed as owls . How would that be ? " " You mean you want us to run so you'n have an excuse to shoot us . " " By God , no . I think you 've been punished enough . " " Maybe you 're another damned Judas like Hinkle . " " I do n't know Hinkle from Adam . Well , you do as you like . I 'm just saying what I 'd do if I was in your shoes . " " All right , we 'll see . " John Hogarth was not a Judas . During this evening , he encouraged the sheriff and the two guards to drink lustily , and pretended to drink with them . He told Lyman and the other prisoners to pretend to drink also and to act as drunk as lords ; and Lyman did . He affected such drunkenness that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holy mother of Christ ! " the sheriff roared , waving a bottle . " You 're all drunkern I be ! " The other prisoners , accepting the flasks when offered and making gurgling sounds in their throats , also pretended to be as drunk as pirates . Lyman and McRae staggered arm in arm around the camp and then crawled on hands and knees , swearing by all the angels that they were unable to stand ; and the sheriff and the two guards laughed at themp224until they wept . Hogarth sat a little way off , nodding stupidly as if falling asleep ; but his alert eyes were watching the sheriff . Lyman crawled over to the sheriff and begged for a bottle but the sheriff swore by all the devils in hell that he had n't more than enough for himself . " You do n't need no more . You 'll be dead soon . " " Thash , " said Lyman , wagging his head owlishly , " ish why . Pleash give a drink to a dying man ! " The sheriff doubled over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his drunken eyes , and saw Joseph who lay prone on the earth as if dead . " Look at your old prophet ! " he yelled . " By God , ai n't he in a pickle now ! " Lyman was gazing with sly covetousness at the pistols hanging from the sheriff 's waist . The sheriff turned and slapped a guard on his back . " Holy Jesus ! " he howled . " Look ! " He pointed at McRae who was solemnly trying to drink whiskey from an empty tin can . Then he saw Joseph crawling over to a blanket and fumbling with it . When Joseph stretched out , with the blanket over nothing but his feet , the sheriff almost burst with joy and staggered over to a saddlebag for another flask . McRae crawled over to Joseph , taking the can with him , and lay on his back ; and soon the two men were snoring as if sound asleep . In a few moments Hyrum went over and lay by them . John Hogarth was still sitting with his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everythingthat was done . A little later , too drunk to stand , the sheriff sank to the earth , clutching a flask ; and the two guards staggered over and sat by him and the three men drank until none of them could sit up . Lyman looked over at Hogarth and waited . At a moment when he thought the time had come , the sheriff waved his flask unexpectedly and howled . " Do n't you fellows try to escape ! " he bellowed . He struggled to sit up and then fell back and grunted . " You hear me ? " he asked . Nobody answeredhim and in a few minutes he was dead to the world . Hogarth rose and came over . " Now 's your chance , " he said softly . " Can we take their guns ? " " Sure . You 'll need them . " Lyman went quietly to the sheriff and the two guards and looked down at them . He stooped and drew the pistols from the holsters . Hogarthp225had gone with Joseph and McRae to catch @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into darkness . When the prisoners were mounted and armed , Hogarth turned up to them his red and friendly face . " Good luck . Mebbe I 'll see you again some day . " Joseph leaned down to clasp his hand . " God will bless you , " he said . " I do n't know about that . I just figgered you 'd suffered enough . " " You 're true blue , " said Lyman . " If you ever get over our way , we'dlike to have you in our church . " " Thanks , " said Hogarth , grinning . " I ai n't much for religion . " Joseph straightened and looked over at the sheriff and the guards . " Come , " he said , and the men rode into the night.  | UPON THAT DAY IN FAR WEST WHEN JOSEPH AND THE OTHERS WERE marched off to jail , Brigham Young was in hiding . During the weeks that followed , he knew that efforts were being made to capture him ; but he outsmarted his enemies at every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen prairies , rebuking the apostates , instructing and cheering the faithful , and preparing for a great migration to another land . Only his energy and resourcefulness saved the church from ruin . Tim McBride went with him often and saw what was done . The saints were scattered in a thousand places , some hiding in abandoned shacks , some in hazel or cottonwood thickets , and some in tents far out in the wilderness . Others moved by wagon or horse or afoot from place to place , going fearfully , going none knew where , but afraid to remain long in one spot . Day after day Brigham rode over the huge area around Far West , seeking the refugees and wanderers and bringing them to new life and hope . " Cheer up ! " he would say . " Damn it , we 're not whipped yet . All the gentiles in hell ca n't whip us . " " I do n't know , " said a half-starved man one day . With a wife and six children he had crowded into a tent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ frozen beef and a little corn meal . " Where 's your cattle ? " " I do n't know . " " Where 's your wagon and oxen ? " " Somebody stole them . " " Go find them . Get ready . We 're moving to Illinois . " He turned to the gaunt wife . " Ca n't you smile any more . " All the smiles has gone out of me . " " Smile ! God does n't love a coward . How are the children ? " " All about half-sick . " Brigham looked at six children shivering in rags . " Tim , ride over and fetch some food and clothes . "  |p227After  Brigham had found all the saints in the villages and open places , he rode up and down the streams and through the forests , seeking those who had fled ; commanding them to find a team and wagon to make the journey ; telling them where to go for clothes and food . He was first among the twelve apostles now . With Joseph in prison , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the leader of the scattered people . He called the High Council , his body of advisers , and had apostles chosen to replace the apostates who had fled ; had hundreds excommunicated and cast out ; and rebuked with vigorous and profane words those who were weak and afraid . " By the living God of Israel , " he roared to a multitude , " we ai n't whipped yet ! We 'll build our kingdom somewhere , and the damned gentilescan froth at the mouth and bite their own unclean flesh but they will not prevail against us ! We have power in us and I want you to feel it . God is on our side . This is no time for your damned infernal whining and puling ! Let your beards grow , get dirt under your fingernails , get calluses on you as big as hoecakes ; but never say you 're whipped ! Let the weaklings flee : we do n't want them . Let the cowards go back to Ohio or New York or England . We 'll move to a new frontier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God that I 'll never rest until our kingdom is built and our enemies come crawling on hands and knees to lick our hands and ask for peace ! ... " Nobody could resist a leader like that . Nobody could hear him without cheering , or grasp his strong hand without feeling new strength . And one by one or family by family , the saints began to move and gather their belongings and prepare for a long journey to another home . Brighamappointed men to assist him with the exodus ; sent agents to store granaries of corn along the route ; and made contracts for ferrying the thousands across the Mississippi near Quincy . In December the first train of wagons set out , and from then until early spring there was a continuouscaravan of emigrants , some in wagons , some on horses or afoot , herding a few beasts along with them or leading small children by the hand . Many fell sick and some died of hunger or cold weather ; but Brigham kept the ragged line moving across the frozen earth . Nights passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to cheer the stragglers , to helpp228the sick , to bury the dead , and to keep hope burning like a fire in ten thousand hearts . Early one cold morning , when the sky looked like chilled slate and the marshes steamed , Tim rode furiously up to the shack where Brigham had slept . " Run ! " he howled , tumbling from his horse . " Now what 's the matter ? " " They 're coming to murder you ! " " Who ? Calm yourself . " " Get on my horse ! " cried Tim , agog with excitement . He grasped Brigham and shoved him toward the nag . " God Almighty , hurry ! A mob is on the way to murder you ! " " You sure ? " asked Brigham , gazing across frozen prairie and seeing no one . " One of them told me . My God , be quick ! " Brigham looked back at the hut . " Go get my gun , " he said , and mounted the horse . " Tim , you keep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head for Quincy . " Brigham rode away at a stiff gallop and Tim ducked for cover . Within a few minutes a dozen horsemen came over the skyline and bore down on the shack ; and Tim , peering from a snow-covered bush , saw that they were well-armed . They dismounted and entered the shack and then came out and gazed around them . One of them saw hoof prints in the thin snow and pointed in the direction Brigham had taken ; and they all mounted and set off in pursuit . Brigham had never been outwitted yet and did not intend to be now . He hid by day and rode by night until he came to the river ; whereupon , suspecting that enemies would be waiting at the ferry , he went several miles downstream and hired a lad to take him across in a canoe . In Quincy he was safe . In Quincy , indeed , he was an honored stranger ; for he had been here many times , arranging for the migration and establishinggoodwill . The citizens of Illinois , outraged @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ appointed committees here and elsewhere to relieve the destitute and homeless and provide work for those who sought it . The Democratic Association recommended to the residents of Quincy that in all intercourse with the strangers they should be carefulp229not to wound their feelings , or " in any way reflect upon those who , by every law of humanity , are entitled to our sympathy and commiseration . " The rebuke to a neighboring state was vigorous . " The inhabitants upon the western frontier of the state of Missouri , in their late persecution of the people denominated Mormons , have violated the sacred rights of conscience and every law of justice and humanity . The governor of Missouri , in refusing protection to this class of people , when pressed upon by a heartless mob , and turning upon them a band of unprincipled militia , with orders encouraging their extermination , has brought a lasting disgrace upon the state over which he presides . " It was with sympathy and aid that the saints were met as they poured into the city . A few who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ employment in the town ; but hundreds lived in shacks and tents on the outskirts , awaiting the next move . Both the governor and Stephen Douglas spoke boldly against the brutalities in Missouri and welcomed the Mormons , but the wise Brigham knew there was trouble ahead . He foresaw , as the citizens of Quincy did not , that among the endlesshorde pouring in there would be adventurers and shysters who would take advantage of charity or seek to loot . And when he arrived now , he was not surprised to learn that matters were not as he had left them a month ago . There was growing anger because of the insolence and thefts of some of the invaders . Knowing that he must act at once , he published in the Quincy newspaper a statement , declaring that in so great an influx of strangers there were rascals , pretending to belong to the church , who had come only to exploit human kindness . There were blasphemers and drunkards and thieves who had been expelled from fellowship . He called upon the citizens to scorn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he realized , was not enough . He was appalled when he saw how his hordes had given to an attractive city the aspect of a migratory camp . The homes of generous citizens had been filled to overflowing . The edges of the town , east , north and west , looked as if beggars and nomads had laid siege ; for there were temporary shacks , tents on every vacant lot and roadside , livestock breaking into every pasture and field , hogs and dogs and sheep and chickens running wild , as well as hundreds of families who had less than a shack or a tent and lived in a wagonp230or nothing at all . And even now , the ferry was busy all day long as a steady stream of weary and hungry and ragged persons marched in . Here was a situation that demanded the utmost of tact . " By God , " said Brigham to an assistant , " we 'll have civil war if we do n't get out . We must move in a hurry . " " Yes , " said John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Though quiet and unassuming , he was morbidly sensitive about his person and his rights . In Missouri he had once turned purple with rage and bellowed : " I would n't be a slave to God Almighty Himself ! " He now added : " I suggest you see Dr. Galland . He has a lot of land up north and says he will sell it to us cheap . " " Is it good land ? " " No , it 's a swamp but we could drain it . " " You watch things here and I 'll see about it . " " The governor of Iowa has invited us to move over there . " " All right , get a bunch of them moving . I 'll see Galland . " Galland 's bog dismayed Brigham almost as much as the condition of his people in Quincy . It was a timbered swamp on the bank of the Mississippi River  --  a sunken area of mosquitoes and fever ; and when Brigham set out to explore it , he fell headlong into a quagmire and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ After threshing around like a mired ox , he crawled out , dripping with stinking slime and mud . " No wonder , " he said , after returning to Quincy , " Galland wants to sell it . Neither land nor water animal could get across his damned property . You ca n't walk , wade or swim . " " There 's nothing else , " said Taylor . " I 've searched everywhere . " " The Oregon country . That 's where we belong . " " Reports say California has good soil . " Brigham looked around him and considered . He missed the spiritual leadership of Joseph : that indefinable power in the man that could arouse a multitude to feverish industry and unite them in a common crusade . Without the prophet , he himself was only an organizer who gathered the thousands into a group and wondered what to do with them ; for God did not speak to him or announce revelation by revelation what was to be done next . So when , two days later , Brigham learned that Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ through to declare that half thep231state of Missouri was chasing the prophet to the Mississippi River , but that Joseph was far in the lead and was safe . " God be praised ! Will he soon be here ? " " Any day now . " " Did the others escape too ? " " All of them , I think . " Brigham was glad . He was deeply pleased until he gave earnest thought to the matter . He was president of the Twelve . For months he had been the leader of the church . He had ignored the pompously ambitious Rigdonas well as every other man who had stood in his way . But Joseph was another matter : he would be the leader again if he outwitted the mobs and got across the river . Joseph was a good prophet and seer ; he was invincible in the spiritual realms , but he was no leader of men . Three times now he had almost wrecked the church with his impracticalnotion that God would take care of things when Joseph could no longer do so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and it was a wonder that he was alive at all ; and while in jail he had sent epistles of hope and patience and prayer , as if these had anything to do with moving ten thousand freezing and starving persons beyond reach of their enemies . Yes , he was a great prophet : Brigham never doubted that ; but he was no man to take a ragged and embittered people and build them into a kingdom . Nevertheless , when Joseph suddenly appeared one afternoon , bearded and pale and dirty , and looking like a John the Baptist just emerged from a jungle , even the hard-headed Brigham wept . He threw his arms around Joseph and gave him a mighty hug , and then turned away to hide tears . Everyone wept . Everyone rejoiced , including the astonished gentiles who had never seen him before . Word of his coming went like fire on a wind , and Mormons left their shacks and tents and work and followed him in a great mob as he went down a street . Hundredsof voices broke into jubilant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a prophet To guide us in these latter days ! We thank thee for sending the gospelTo lighten our minds with its rays ! . . Children wept , seeing their parents weep ; women , wild with joy , pressedp232in to touch him ; and men whose eyes had never before been wet marched with blurred vision . In his triumphant pilgrimage down the street , Joseph was overwhelmed by the welcome and walked with tears running down his cheeks . These were his people , this was his church ! Behind him a thousand voices rang high and clear in thankfulness to God . There is hope shining brightly before us , And we know that deliverance is nigh ! .. . Brigham marveled at the power of this man to arouse wild enthusiasm . For nearly six months he had been chained in a dungeon ; and now he was here , walking like a ragged king , and greeted by the most thunderouswelcome Brigham was ever to hear . Looking to his right , he saw the pale ambitious face of Sidney Rigdon , and he did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes . He did not like the way the tall gaunt bigot was looking at Joseph . Joseph , the prophet , was again with his people and he was again the leader . His heart was a bugle within him . There had been times when he doubted himself but those times were gone : God had delivered him from his enemies and he was never to doubt again that he could be as mighty as he wished to be . His confidence was so great that it overwhelmedthose who grasped his hand or looked into his blue eyes . He walked like a king and he felt like a king ; and he was fully determined to be a powerful ruler before his days were done . His first act was so dramatic that it left Brigham speechless . For Joseph went to look at the Galland bog ; and while standing on an eminence , gazing over the area of fevers and pestilence , he extended an arm and spoke . " Right on this spot we will build a great and beautiful city . We will call @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beautiful place . " " Confound it , " said Parley Pratt , who had also escaped from jail , " this is a malaria bog ! It 's no spot for us . " Joseph smiled . A man who had escaped from chains and a dungeon was not to be afraid of a swamp . Besides , he liked to think of doing what no other man would dare undertake . " Here , " he said , " we will build Nauvoo , the city beautiful . In three years it will be the largest city in Illinois . " ** 232 " Damn it , " said Brigham , recovering from his amazement , " why choose a bog ? Why not go west ? " Joseph was seeing in a vision the city that would soon be here . " Make arrangements to buy all this land . This will be our home . " He turned to the men with him . " Come , I will show you something . " With them he descended from the eminence and entered the swampy meadows . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grass . It was a cone of dense perfect flowers surrounded by a large white lily that turned over and downward like a piece of white velvet . Framing it were enormous green leaves on slender tubular stalks . " If , " he said , " God chooses such a spot for such loveliness , we can build a city here . " He walked with the men and came next to a small garden of wild yellow lilies . Countless flowers nodded on long peduncles , with lovely leaves forming a vase . The blossoms , yellow and red and orange , were thickly spotted with dark brown dots as if they had been sprayed with flakes of tobacco leaf . " This flower , " said Joseph , " was abundant in New York . Do you remember it ? And the grass pinks ? " he said , moving to another garden . He pointed to loose racemes of pink sepals and petals , bearded with yellow and rose-colored hairs . " I say to you that where God places such loveliness , there can we build @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And arrangements were made . Land was purchased and the hardier saints began to move in and build . " We 'll all die of fever , " Brigham said to Parley , " or fall into bogs and disappear . " " It looks bad , but where Joseph leads , we follow . " " You , " said Brigham slyly , " followed him to jail but I did n't . " " I 'll follow Joseph anywhere . " The saints followed with such energy and eagerness that the gentileswere astounded . Hundreds of families loaded their belongings on wagonsand moved to the new site ; and within a week there was the clear hardsound of axes in the adjacent forests , the smell of lumber and sawdust , the fragrance of broken sod . Even many of the leaders were in rags . Parley went into the timber barefooted and bareheaded and felled treesand recited florid Popean couplets to the men who labored with him . Brigham went in worn-out shoes that were laced to his feet with twine.  |p234The  proud John Taylor , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Almost overnight the swamp became a settlement of tents , and then one by one houses appeared and the city began to grow . Some pushed farther north or east , buying land or leasing it ; some went across the river to Montrose , a village in Iowa , and others pushed westward from there . The whole country in all directions was alive with the industry of thousands ; and saints in New York and Ohio , hearing of this new and mighty effort , packed up and moved to the new Zion . Brigham had been the Moses who led the hordes out of Egypt , but Joseph was the prophet and king who directed their labor now . All day long he was busy , riding among his people on a white horse and cheering and commanding . " Sister Betsy , your child is sick ? You 've been drinking polluted water . Have your husband dig a well . " One day he met Lyman Wight . " Lyman , you give us too much trouble . Why did you say the Democratic party @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not true . " " It is true . The damned Democrats " " I say it is not true . Watch your tongue . Here in Illinois are two parties , the Democrats and Whigs . Soon we 'll control the elections but we do n't want to make enemies . " " I despise the damned Democrats ! " " For shame , Lyman . You have too hot a temper . Learn to control it . " One and another he instructed or advised or rebuked . " Parley , have n't you any shoes ? Ask Brigham for some . He always has money , though I sometimes wonder where he gets it . " Or to Rigdon : " Brother Sidney , you 're too proud . Get an axe and cut logs and build you a house . " " I ? " asked Rigdon , still looking half-crazed . " I 'm second in command . Why should I do common labor ? " " We must all labor in the vineyard of God . Find an axe and get to work . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better than the rest of us ? " " Brother Sidney , I have spoken . Go build a house . " And so matters went for two months , with the prophet giving strength to weary bodies , putting faith in weak souls . But Parley and Brigham hadp235been right : the new site was a swamp of fevers , and suddenly the dreaded malaria swept the encampment . In cabins , in tents , or along the river bank or in brush upon the sand , persons lay by scores . Remembering the scourge of cholera in Zion 's Camp , Joseph was frightened , not knowing what to do in the face of this new catastrophe . He went from tent to hut , from hut to river bank , laying his hands on fevered brows and speakingwords of cheer to persons who were dying . He sent riders for doctors , but doctors upon this frontier were busy and none of them would come . One evening in the tent where he lived with Emma he bowed his head . Emma had been dragged from place to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had hated and despaired and hoped so often that she now looked like a gaunt spinster of fifty . Her mind was full of malice and her tongue was sharp . " A fine mess you got us into this time ! You dragged us off to Missouri where bandits chased us , and then you took us into a bog to die of rot . And you call yourself a prophet ! " " God is very angry again , " said Joseph , and raised a haggard face . " Too many of the saints are living in sin . " " You 're no gilded lily yourself . " " The Almighty is angry with His people . " " I ca n't see what the Almighty has to do with it . It looks like mosquitoes and stinking water to me . " Leaping to his feet , Joseph thundered : " Silence ! " " Do n't tell me to shut up . I say you took us into a swamp to die . " " I 'll make that swamp the most beautiful city in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . Just plow sod over them whenthey 're all dead . " " Silence , I told you ! " " And I thought , " Emma went on remorselessly , " you said the United States would pay for our losses in Missouri . " " They will . " " You make a poor mouth ! Why , in a few days you 'll be sick too or Governor Boggs will have you extradited and throw you in a dungeon again . It 's sixes either way . " " You drive me insane ! " he cried , glaring at her . " You 're no wife for a prophet . "  | " You 're no prophet . Why do n't you go out and heal the sick ? " For a long moment he gazed at her . " You do n't think I can ? " " If you 're a prophet you can . " " I can , " he said . " Then do it . It 's quicker than medicine . " He went out and looked at the sky @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'll go and heal the sick , " he said . " Do ! " she said scornfully . " And why did n't God get you out of jail sooner ? There 's no sense for a prophet to sit in a dungeon for six months . " He went away and called Parley and John Taylor and Heber Kimball and said he was going forth to heal the sick . " Come , " he said , his face gray with determination . " We 'll go to Montrose first . " They crossed the river in canoes and climbed the bluff to the village . Of the first man he met Joseph asked : " What saint over here is nearest death ? " " Why  --  well , by gum , I guess Elijah Fordham is . " " Take me to his house . " While going to the house , Joseph silently prayed for strength . When he looked at Elijah he was dismayed . The man was very ill . His face had a leprous pallor , his eyes were yellowish , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a week . Joseph stooped and laid a hand on the moist brow . " Brother Elijah , do you know me ? " Elijah rolled his dying eyes upward . His dry lips moved but uttered no sound . Then , with an effort , he nodded his head faintly in assent and gave Joseph a wan smile . " Do you believe I am a prophet of God ? " Elijah nodded . " Do you believe that as a prophet I have power to heal ? " " Yes , " said Elijah in a whisper barely audible . " Do you understand that I have come to heal you ? " " Yes . " Joseph rose to his fullest height . He took one of Elijah 's limp hands and for a moment gazed at the man with hypnotic directness ; and then , in a voice that would have startled the dead , he thundered : " Brother Elijah , in the name of Jesus Christ , the living God , I command you to rise and walk ! "  |p237A  tremor ran through Elijah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his veins . He stiffened , as from shock ; and then , slowly , deliberately , he rose from the bed and stood erect , sheathed in bandages and plasters from head to feet . With amazing strength he tore a plaster from him ; shuddered again as if he had been raised from the dead ; and turned and clasped Joseph 's hand . " Bring me food ! " he cried . " I 'm as hungry as a horned owl . " He tore other plasters from his body and wrapped a blanket around him . His wife went for food and returned with a bowl of bread and milk ; and Elijah sat at a table and ate as if he had been starved for months . " Just as soon as I dress , " he said , speaking out of bread and milk , " I 'll go with you . I am a well man . " He did go , and other persons too ; and in a little while Joseph was followed by a crowd of saints and gentiles . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to meet him and to beg his presence next in this shack or that tent ; and all day he marched up and down healing the sick . Over some he had no power : if a person failed to rise to his thundering command , Joseph told his leaders that the sick one had been very sinful or had no faith in his soul , and that God probably wished his death . But many , including children , left their sick beds and dressed and followed him ; and a few amazed gentiles , watching the miracles , asked to be baptized at once and accepted into the church . With awed eyes they stared at Elijah Fordham as if doubting that he was real . He looked , it is true , more like a cadaver than a human being ; but he walked all afternoon and found himself strengthened when evening came . Confident of his power , Joseph sent his leaders forth to heal , and their success was hardly less miraculous than his own . For days they labored in faith and prayer . Some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the forest or along the stream ; but the magnetism of Joseph had filled the settlement from end to end . In two weeks the plague abated and the building of Nauvoo was resumed . " Do you think now , " Joseph asked his wife , " that I am a prophet ? " Emma 's black eyes still shone with contempt . " If you are , why did you let so many die ? " " They had no faith in them . They were too sinful . " " That 's a handy excuse . If a person lives it 's because you healed him , but if he dies it 's because God wanted him to die . "  | " I healed dozens , " he said proudly . " They would have died without me . " " I do n't believe it . Some people always get well . " " You have no faith . If you get sick you 'll probably die . " " I wo n't count on you . " " Ye of little faith , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and plan its growth . Fully restored to leadership and to confidence in his power , he received revelations again . God asked the saints to build a temple here , and a large boardinghouse for Joseph . Some came with tools to work ; some came in rags and laid their last dollar at the prophet 's feet . Some fetched trinkets . " We want gold and silver , " Joseph said in meeting , " but we do n't want your old nose rings and finger rings and brass kettles . If you have watches or guns , go sell them and bring us the hard metal . If any of you are hungry or naked , come to me and I will divide my last morsel . If you are not content then I will kick your backside . " " You 're getting mighty bold , " said Emma that evening , " to be telling persons you 'll kick their hinders . You might get your own kicked . " " I ? " said Joseph , smiling . " Emma dear , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now on I am a fighting prophet . If my enemies bother me any more , I 'll use them for dung in my garden . " " Lord , but you 're getting bold . You did n't talk so mouth-almighty in Missouri . " " I 'm building a kingdom . In two years I 'll control Illinois . Then I 'll run for President . " " You 'll run , all right , but it wo n't be for President . You 'll be running from the sheriff . " Joseph turned to look at his gaunt and bitter wife . For fifteen years he had tolerated her contempt and her scorn . He thought of women here who were young and lovely , and he sighed . " Only the Almighty can whip me now . You see how Nauvoo is growing ? Can you imagine what a city I will have here ? But no : you hate me whom everyone else loves . " " Oh , Lord ! I guess Sidney Rigdon loves you . He 'd cut your throat if he could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ So are you . " " I am only a humble prophet who is building a kingdom for God . "  |p239Emma  's spinsterish eyes looked at him . " When do I move into this big boardinghouse you 're building ? " " Within a year . I have much to do and I 'm going to do it myself . I have too many ambitious men around me . I 'm going to send them all on missions . We need more converts . " " You 'll send them away so you can sleep with their wives . " " Emma ! " " Oh , to hell with your pious stuff ! Do n't you think I know what you 've been doing ? Because you 're a prophet , does that mean you can be adulterous ? " " You 're blasphemous ! " he cried . " The spirit of God has never been in you . " " I 've seen too much of it in you . " " Yes ? " he said , wondering what she meant by that . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " For shame , " he said , thinking of Abraham and Solomon . " I 'm going to build a kingdom right here on the bank of the Mississippi . I 'll have my own city , my private army , my own judges and courts " You 'll have nothing of the sort . As soon as he gets around to it , Boggs will have you extradited and throw you in a dungeon again . " " I ' 11 take care of Boggs . " " Why did n't you long ago ? Why did n't you set Port Rockwell on him ? " Joseph looked at her sharply . " You talk too much , " he said . Joseph not only wanted more converts ; he wanted some of his headstrongleaders out of the way . He called the twelve apostles to missions in England and ordered them to go even when some of them were ill . Brigham was so weak that he had to be assisted from Montrose to the ferry ; and upon arriving in Nauvoo he sank with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was able to stir . " Brother Brigham , " said Joseph , looking in on him one day , " you must be off . " " Yes , " said Brigham . " You are to go with Heber . " " But Heber 's wife and all his children are sick . " " The Lord will watch over them . " Joseph entered the shack and laid a hand on Brigham 's forehead . " You 're not very ill . Your faith is weak . " " By the living God , if I 'm not sick I never want to be . "  | " You are strong enough to go now . " With a great effort Brigham left his bed and sought Heber , and the two men hitched a team to a wagon and set out for the East . Heber 's wife was shaking with ague ; all his children were in bed . Heber himself was very ill . A crowd gathered to watch the men depart and to cheer them ; and after the wagon had gone fifty yards @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with tears , and looked back . " Brigham , this is damned tough but let 's give them a cheer . " " All right , " Brigham said , and staggered to his feet . Supporting one another , the two sick apostles waved their hats and feebly shouted a hurrah for Israel . The multitude answered . " I feel , " said Heber , " like we 'll never see them again . " Other men , sick in body and soul , left when Joseph called . Three of them set out in a wagon which overturned ; and two of them were too sick to rise and had to be assisted by the third . In pairs , or three by three , the sick men were called and said good-bye to their families and set out , with no money and in ragged clothes , for a strange country four thousand miles away . To those who protested , Joseph always gave the same answer . " He that loveth father or mother , houses or lands , wives or children more than he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you must go . " And the apostles went . For Joseph had a mighty dream in his heart now and he was being driven by impassioned eagerness that gave him no rest . While his leaders were gone , he would build a great and beautiful city here ; and when they returned , they would stare in amazement at what he had done . Needing money , he resolved to go to Washington and try to collect for the losses in Missouri ; and one morning , not long after he had sent the apostles forth , he set out in a carriage with Rigdon and Porter Rockwell to see the President . Day after day as he traveled he sang hymns . Enemies , he knew , were all around him , for Governor Boggs had sent spies out ; but he was unafraid of enemies now . In Springfield , Rigdon fell ill and Joseph left Rockwell with him and went on alone . It was a long and tiresome journey . Sometimes he ate and slept in the homes of his people , and sometimes with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ read of the persecutions in Missouri , and they denounced Governor Boggs and encouraged Josephp241in his mission . Joseph was convinced , long before he reached Washington , that President Van Buren would listen to him and redress his wrongs . He did not know what a fat and pompous little politician he would have to deal with . As soon as Joseph presented his letters of introduction his heart sank . Van Buren read them and looked up and scowled . " What do you expect of me , Mr. Smith ? " " Justice , Mr. President . " " Justice ? " " Yes , sir . " " Well , possibly your cause is just . I ca n't say . But I can do nothing for you . " Why not , Mr. President ? " " That 's a stupid question . If I did anything I 'd lose the vote of Missouri . " Joseph stared at the sandy little man and felt wrathful . " Mr. President , mobs in Missouri not only murdered us and ravished our women . They also stole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but there 's nothing I can do . " " You mean that the Constitution of this great nation  --  " " I can not afford to arouse the anger of Missouri . " " Under the Constitution  --  " " Yes , Mr. Smith , I know all about the Constitution . But I am helpless . " " Then we 'll petition Congress . " " That is your privilege . " " Mr. President , out in Illinois , prominent persons have been outraged by our treatment in Missouri . " " What prominent persons ? " asked the President , scowling . " Abraham Lincoln for one . Stephen Douglas for another . " " Abraham Lincoln ? I do n't think I 've ever heard of him . " " He is well liked out there . Some day I think he will be a very powerfulperson . " " That may all be true , " said the President impatiently . " I can do nothing for you . And now , if you do n't mind , I am very busy . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowed . " Good morning , Mr. Smith . " " Good morning , Mr. President . Permit me to say that this matter is not settled yet . " Joseph went out in great fury , noting the vulgar elegance of thisp242mansion in which lived the president of a democratic nation . He went to Senators and jurists and arranged to have a petition presented to the Congress ; but he knew his cause was lost . Feeling bitter and vindictive , he ordered his carriage and set out on the long homeward journey . If he could not win in one way , he would win in another . If , under the charter of a free land , there was no protection for human conscience and human rights , then he would build a kingdom of his own . He would control the elections in the province he governed ; and year by year he would push his boundaries out , add converts by the thousands , recruit to his cause the wisest of leadership , and become the most powerful man in the United States . Then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nation 's throne . Such was his dream during the long journey homeward ; and when he arrived , he was ready to fight as he had never fought before.  | A FEW MONTHS LATER , THE NAUVOO HOUSE WAS DONE . A TWO-STORY structure of red brick in the form of an L , with a frontage of a hundred and twenty feet on two streets , and a depth of forty , it had cost a hundred thousand dollars . It stood on the bank of the river , with Nauvoo behind it in the north and northeast , and Montrose in clear view across the river in the southwest . North of it , Joseph planned to build another house in which to live , and some day to use this big structure chiefly for entertaining and for church offices . He could stand at the window of his study and gaze at a thriving city . The swamps had been conquered , and upon them stood homes , stores and shops . A temple was rising on a hill in the north , and it was to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ white limestone , eightythreeby a hundred and twenty-eight feet in breadth and depth , and sixty feet in height , it would have an upper story and a basement . In the latter would be a baptismal font , wrought after the manner of King Solomon 's brazen sea . The huge tank would have panels upon which would he painted scenes both biblical and Mormon ; and the stairway to it would be supported by twelve great oxen , overlaid with gold . The temple would be crowned by a high steeple surrounded by angels and trumpets . It would cost a million dollars . It made Joseph happy to think of it , but he was happy for other reasons also . Emma was going to have another child and he hoped she would nag him less after the infant came . The apostles in England were converting persons by the hundreds . One of them indeed , a kindly blueeyedgentleman named Wilford Woodruff , had converted so many that Parliament was alarmed and in a mood to do something about it . A few of the English converts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ United States were also successful , and were establishing colonies from the Atlantic Ocean to the Mississippi . And there were still other reasons why Joseph was happy . By promisingthe Mormon vote to the Whigs , he had exacted from the legislaturep244a charter for a university , a military organization , and for his city ; and with those , his power in his small kingdom would be absolute . Abraham Lincoln had voted for the charters . So had Stephen Douglas . Influential men in Illinois smiled upon him and his people . Soon he would have an army of several thousand well-trained and fully armed men . " Then , " he thought , gazing at Nauvoo , " let my enemies dare come against me ! " Suddenly he saw Louisa Bemen and raised a window to smile at her . " Good morning , Sister Louisa . " " Good morning , " she said , returning his smile . His gaze roved down her handsome body and then rested on her saucy face . " I want to see you in a few days  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , Brother Joseph . " He liked this girl . She was healthy and vivacious and  --  yes , so sensible ; and besides , she had been smiling at him for weeks as if to show how white her teeth were . He hardly knew why he wished to see her in a few days . Still , he did know . Month by month , as he came into power and peace , as he saw his city grow and his military organization take form , he thought of the advantage in the next life for those who had many offspring . He needed many wives  --  and many children if in the next world he was to advance rapidly toward godhood ; because power there was determined by the number of progeny , as well as by righteous living in this world . He rememberedagain that God had peopled this planet and was still siring the millions of souls that came to human birth . There were other reasons no less urgent . In Nauvoo were more women than men , and Joseph abhorred prostitutes . If @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a lover and fall into abominable adultery ; or she would sell herself in the brothels . He wanted no harlots in this city . Another reason , he admitted , with a wry smile for himself , was his appetite : he had never looked at a beautiful woman without wishing to touch her . This he had formerly regarded as a weakness of his flesh ; but now he felt that God had planned for him to have many wives , and the more he considered the matter , the more certain his conviction became . Whether he should take wives and keep the matter secret , he did not know . Perhaps there was no need to worry : he was king in this tiny empire : his word was law . If he were caught , he could inquire of God and receive a revelation ; because he had known for a long while thatp245God would speak to him on the subject before his years were done . It was first a matter of making himself secure and his people happy . A few days later , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was a beautiful morning , he said . It was , she admitted , and gave him a roguish smile . She said the woods were full of wild flowers . " Yes , " he said , looking at her . He added : " Louisa , I wish to speak of a very important matter . You believe I am a prophet , do n't you ? " " Yes , Brother Joseph . " " You believe that what I do is sanctioned by the Lord ? " " Yes , of course . " He took her hands and gazed at her fair face . " Louisa , you are to be my wife . " " Your wife ! " she cried , astonished . " But you have a wife . " " Yes , but I 'm to have another wife . It is God 's will . " " I do n't understand , " she said , but her voice was gentle . He drew her to him and held her close . He stooped and kissed her soft mouth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm a prophet and not like other men . Besides , in our church , the duty of the sisters is to marry and have children and assist their husbands toward godhood . That is their earthly function . If they do not serve that function , then they are damnable in the sight of heaven . They will have only the lowest degree of glory or none at all . You must understand and rememberone very important thing in salvation : in this church , a woman cannotreach glory in the next world if she has no husband in this one . " " But I can get a husband , " she said pertly , looking up at him . " A husband like me ? " " Well , no . " " I 've watched you for months . You 're in love with me . " " With you ? " she asked , pouting at him . " I 've admired you . All the sisters admire you . I would n't have dared to touch you , yet you have kissed me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he said , and put his lips to her throat . " Will you be my wife ? " Her blood was racing . He was so large and handsome and self-assured . " Are you sure , " she asked , feeling weak , " that it would be all right ? " " In Nauvoo , anything I do is all right . " " But Emma , what will she say ? "  | " I 'll not tell her about it . " " Oh , " said Louisa , wondering about that . " But if you do n't tell her  --  " " You 'll move into the Nauvoo House and have a room . I 'll say you have no money and I 'm taking care of you . " " But  --  " she said , troubled . She gazed up at him , thinking of his handsomehead on the same pillow with hers . " You sure it 's all right with God ? " " Of course . Am I not His prophet ? Was He angry with Abraham because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " How many wives do you want ? " " The more wives I have , the sooner I 'll be a god in the next life . You 'll be one of my wives there , forever and ever . " That thought pleased her . It would be sweet to be the wife of a prophet in this world , and of a god in the next . " When , " she added breathlessly , " am I to come ? " " As soon as we are married . " " Who will marry us ? " " Someone I can trust . " " But Emma  --  you know we 're all afraid of her . " " Do n't worry about Emma . We must keep it a secret . You 'll have a room all your own and you 'll eat at our table ; but you 'll be only a destitutesister I 'm providing for . You will treat me like any other brother except when you are alone with me . " Louisa moved into Nauvoo House and was given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have more than two wives ; but he learned that not all the women of his choice would yield with Louisa 's impulsive candor . He had set his heart on several , among whom were Fanny Alger , Lucinda Harris , and the Huntington sisters  --  as well as the beautiful wife of Orson Pratt who was away on a mission . There was Sidney Rigdon 's daughter , Nancy , a charming lass of sixteen . There was Helen Kimball , tall and dark and dignified . There were the Lawrence sisters ... . He saw Fanny one evening out on the river bank ; and after watching her gaze out of loneliness at the mighty stream , he resolved to make her his third wife . He drew near and spoke , and then sat by her . Fanny was not a sensuous girl like Louisa : she seemed full of melancholy and strange buried fire . He saw the fire after he told her what was on his mind.  |p247She  leapt to her feet , horrified , and gazed down at him as if she were looking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " Sister Fanny , do n't offend the Almighty . Sit down . " " I wo n't sit down ! " " Then , " he said , rising , " I 'll set you down . " He lifted her as he might have a child , his gaze meeting the amazement in her eyes . Then , without warning , he kissed her throat and held her against him while she fought like a cat . Setting her on the bank , he dropped at her side and smiled . " There 's no use opposing a prophet . God will punish you if you do . " " Oh , God ! What does He have to do with it ? Besides , you have a wife , have n't you ? " " I need many wives . In the next world " There wo n't be any next world for me if I sin in this one ! " " It 's not sin , " he said sternly . " Do you think I , a prophet of God , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way . " Her gaze fell to his mouth : she was remembering how he had kissed her ; and she was annoyed because she remembered with pleasure . She started to rise but he grasped her arm and drew her to him . " Fanny , you must be my wife . " " No ! " " I say yes . It is God 's will for you to marry me . If you do not , you will go to hell and be damned . " " Oh , will I ! " Her mouth was scornful but her eyes were troubled . After all , he was a prophet who wrought miracles ; and who was she to say he was wrong ! " I 'll have to think about it . I must go now . " " Tell no one . If you tell , your punishment will be terrible . " She rose and drew her breath sharply . " I 'll probably tell . " " No , " he said , facing her . " I command silence . " She held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but I must think about it . I must be sure it is not sin . " Fanny thought about it for many days and the days grew into weeks . She came to his study and he talked persuasively , eloquently , explaining to her that he was taking wives , not to satisfy carnal desires but because God willed it . He reminded her of the ancient prophets who had hadp248wives many . Little by little , week by week , she yielded , until one day she allowed him to kiss her lips . " I ca n't feel right about it , " she said , her eyes dark with grief . " Fanny , if it was sinful , think what my punishment would be . You do n't think I 'd send myself to hell , do you ? " " No . " " You do n't think God would allow our church to prosper , do you ? " " I 'm not sure it will . What will the gentiles say when they find it out ? " " They wo @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then they 'll persecute us again . " " I have an army now . " " But you ca n't fight the whole country . " " Fanny , leave those worries to me . " She looked at him again . " Has God told you this is not sinful ? " " God will give me a revelation when I ask for it . " " All right , " she said and sighed , and let him draw her to his strong arms . For Lucinda Harris , a buxom and unimaginative lass , Joseph was almost as mighty and infallible as the Lord . She did not argue . She did not protest at all . It was her duty : that was clear , and she came to him willingly , cheerfully , glad to be the wife of so great a man . But before approaching the Huntington sisters , Joseph thought it would be wise to talk with their brother . He summoned Dimmick and walked with him down Mulholland Street to the river and sat with him on the bank . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as if he were a water animal , thrown to the bank and fighting for breath . He rolled his eyes and gasped . " You mean , " he gurgled at last , " you want a-marry both my sisters ? " " Yes , " Joseph said calmly . " But you got a wife ! " " I explained all that to you . You see , Dimmick , a long time ago , when there were prophets on the earth they had many wives . You have read the Bible ? " " Some , " he said . " Today , we must keep the matter a secret or a sinful world will persecuteus again . Under pain of death you must never breathe a word of it . "  | " But you got a wife , " said Dimmick again , as if he could think of nothing else . " I need many wives . Besides , your sisters are about thirty , are n't they ? Are they never to have a husband ? " " That 's what they 've been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of their homeliness , he turned his wondering gaze on Joseph . " Why should you want a-marry homely women ? " " It 's my duty , " said Joseph modestly . " If I married for lust , then I 'd choose young and beautiful wives . I want children . " " I see , " said Dimmick , who saw nothing at all . " Call Precinda out here and we 'll ask her . " The flabbergasted Dimmick went to find his sister , and Joseph sat on the bank , gazing at the stars and wondering which one would warm the planet over which as a god he would eventually rule . He thought of Eliza Snow : he must have her for a wife , too , for she was a poet , and very intelligent and able ... . " Here she is , " said Dimmick . Joseph looked up to see the tired patient face of Precinda . " I told her all about it . " " That 's good , " said Joseph . He rose and faced the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be my wives . " Precinda was as speechless as her red-faced brother : to have a prophet propose marriage to her , a spinster , was as miraculous as the healings . " But  --  " she said . After staring open-mouthed she added : " It 's so unusual , Brother Joseph . " " Yes , perhaps . " He looked at her and knew she would yield . She needed a little time . " You think about it , Precinda . Then let me know . " A week later , Dimmick burst into the study , crying that his sisters had made up their minds . They had prayed and prayed and God had answered them . " But they want to tell you themselves ! " " All right . Have them meet me on the river . " Joseph went without haste , knowing what the answer would be . It did not seem strange to him that he was choosing women less attractive than Louisa . It was a duty to marry these unlovely women and save them from the abominable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Zina 's hands , one of Precinda 's , and looked from face to face . " What is your answer , sisters ? " " We will , " said Precinda , still feeling that she dreamed.  | " Very well . " He turned to Dimmick who had followed and now stood gaping . " This is a secret . Watch your tongue and God will reward you . " " If you say it 's all right , " said Dimmick , wagging his head , " then it must be . But me  --  could I  --  would God care if I got me another wife ? " " Brother Dimmick , many wives are only for prophets and other high leaders . If you are faithful , if you become a leader  --  But not now . " " I see , " said Dimmick , almost swallowing his tongue . " Brother Dimmick , you leave us now . I wish to walk with your sisters . " Joseph now had six wives , but six , he reflected , were less than a handful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world , Solomon 's offspringwould vastly outnumber his own . There were other women in Nauvoo whom he had his eye on , though he was content for a little while to devote himself to the five he had recently chosen . He strove to be impartialwith them and to visit them in turn ; but he had to confess to himself that some women were more adorable than others and more pleasurable to be with . One morning Emma said : " Seems to me you 're getting a lot of charity cases on your hands . Do you intend to board and room all the women who come here ? " " Charity , " he said , " is a part of my service . " " But do you intend to have a whole houseful ? " " I do n't intend to turn needy persons away . " " What is it some of them need , that 's what I do n't understand . I do n't like the way Louisa Bemen looks at you . " " Louisa is a nice woman . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " And if I 'm not mistaken I saw you coming out of Fanny Alger 's room the other morning . Tuesday , it was . " " Sister Fanny was in trouble and called for me . " " What kind of trouble ? " " She had a dream about the Devil . " " About you , " said Emma witheringly . " It would n't surprise me they all dream about you , because you 're Charlie on the spot when they call . " She stared at him , wondering what was going on in this huge house . " I think , " he said , keeping his gaze away from her , " that you will have to go to St. Louis to buy supplies . " " Why me ? Why not you go ? " " Because you 're a better buyer . You always get the bargains . "  | " That 's true , " she said , gazing at him suspiciously . " You never did have any nose for bargains . But if I go , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I get back . " " If , " he said gravely , " any needy sisters come to me , I 'll see that they are taken care of . I wo n't allow anyone to go hungry or unclothed . " Her black eyes were so alive with suspicion that he decided to be more discreet . Nevertheless , the thought of skulking around was distasteful to him ; for was he not a direct descendant of the ancient Joseph and a prophet of God ? Why should anyone dare to question his motives or impute to him unworthiness or carnal desires ? He was moved by the will of the Lord in everything he did ; and if that were not so , then he would not be a prophet . So convinced was he of his godliness in taking many wives that he approached Sarah Pratt , the beautiful and fiery wife of Orson who had been sent to Jerusalem . He liked her . If she were his wife , she would share a higher glory in the next life ; and with this thought in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sister Sarah , how are you today ? " " Very well , Brother Joseph . How are you ? " " I think you must get lonely , with your husband so far away . " " Yes , of course . But as long as he is doing the Lord 's work I must be content . " " I 've been thinking about you , " he said , sitting in her small cabin . " You are one of the most remarkable women among the saints . " " It is kind of you to say so , Brother Joseph . " " Sister Sarah , in the next world , persons will not be equal in glory . Take women , for instance . To share the celestial glory , a woman must be married to a man who will inherit it . That means " Yes ? " she said , wondering what he was driving at . " It means that women married to me will enjoy celestial glory . " " Oh  --  and do n't you think Orson will have that glory ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good man but only the highest in the church will inherit the celestial degree . If you were one of my wives " Brother Joseph , what in heaven 's name are you talking about ? " " Celestial marriage . We saints must marry for time and eternity , as well as for this life . If Brother Orson reaches only the celestial glory in the nextp252world , then that is all you will have . A wife can not rise above her husband . If you were married to me " But you have a wife . And I , " she added , remembering , " have a hus-band . " " I know , Sister . But God has made it known that I am to have many wives . In the next world , " he added hastily . " I want you to be one of my celestial wives in the life hereafter . " " Brother Joseph , are you mad ? " " No , Sarah . " His smile was patient . " My days on this earth are numbered . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the next world . " " But I am a married woman . " " Not for the celestial life . " " In the hereafter I want to be where my husband is . " " Your celestial husband ? " " My earthly husband . I will be with Orson . " " But think of the greater glory if you are my wife hereafter . You ca n't afford - " " Nonsense ! " she cried angrily . " If I have to be a sinful woman I do n't want any glory . " " You are unreasonable , Sister . You had better think it over . " " If I thought about it until the crack of doom , I 'd say what I say now . " " You think it over , " he said gently , and left her . He returned again and again to argue with her . He tried to reason with her . At last , very softly , he threatened her ; and beside herself with fury , she ordered him out of her house @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about celestial glory with you ! I do n't want to be with you ! Now leave my house . " " What did you say ? " " I said to get out and never darken my door again ! " " Sister Sarah , you are speaking to a prophet . " " I do n't care if I 'm speaking to God Himself ! You leave my house and never come back ! You send my husband clear to Jerusalem and then you sneak in and try to seduce me . And you call yourself a prophet ! " A little pale and shaken , Joseph rose to his feet and gazed at her angry face . " Sarah , you have misunderstood . I am not trying to seduce anyone . I offered you the privilege of a higher glory in the next life . That is all . "  | " I do n't want it ! I 'll be with my husband , and if he goes to hell , I 'll go there too . " " You 'll be sorry for this . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intend to cut me off from the church . Is that it ? " " You are very unreasonable . You will be sorry . I only want to be sealed to you , not to live with you now . " " What do you mean by that ? " " Under the ordinances of our church , a man can marry a woman for the next life but she can be married to someone else in this life . Then in the next world , she would be the wife of the man she was sealed to . " " Oh , " she said , flabbergasted . " I suppose you expect to get sealed  --  as you call it  --  to every wife in Nauvoo so you can have thousands in the next life . " " No , not thousands , Sister  --  but a great many . If you marry me for the next life , your glory " " Oh , shut up about glory ! Leave my house ! " " Very well , Sister . But I solemnly charge you to say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a secret until God tells me to make it public . " " A secret ? I should think it would be ! " " So please say nothing about it . " Pained by her stubborn spirit , Joseph left the cabin . It seemed to him very stupid of her to imagine she would be content , during all of eternity without end , in a lower degree of glory than she could have . She might be satisfied now but she would be sorry then.  |p254JOSEPH  HAD HEARD OF JOHN BENNETT . THAT SHREWD OPPORTUNIST , REPREsentinghimself as a soldier of fortune , a politician , and a favorite ofthe great , had been writing flattering letters for months , extolling the new church , praising Joseph to the skies , and offering his services . When Nauvoo prospered , Bennett added that he was a doctor , had been a general in the Illinois militia , and had the ear of men who could be of great assistance in the growth of Mormonism . Joseph smelled the insincerityin the urbane letters . He distrusted the man 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweeping curves of his signature . Nevertheless , he invited Bennett to come to Nauvoo . And when John Bennett walked into the study , Joseph looked up to behold a handsome man whose gracious bearing and soft voice declared him to be as worldly an adventurer as any person between Nauvoo and the Hill of Cumorah . Joseph eyed him closely and wondered if he had made a mistake . " The time will come , " Bennett was saying , after the inanities of greetingwere done with , " when enemies will again be at your throat . That is where I can serve . I have spent most of my life in politics and war . You can use me . You need a man of broad experience to advise you . Besides , " he added , without even the shadow of a smile , " I have been converted to your religion . I believe yours to be the only true church on earth . " " It is , " said Joseph . " On that , " said Bennett gravely , " we fully @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of my experience already in your service " No , Brother John , I need you . " John liked the familiarity . He rubbed his soft white palms and proceeded to other matters . " You are so busy with spiritual problems that you need a man to take care of the temporal ones . You need someone to take off your mind all the petty worries and details of government and city management . I could be your righthand man . As mayor of Nauvoo , for instance ? With your assistance and approval , of course . "  |p255Jose|ph  was still studying the man . Whether John Bennett was a rascal or only a man of extreme zeal , he could not tell . No matter : he believed he could handle him . Had he not put the ambitious Sidney Rigdon in his place , and sent the ambitious apostles on missions ? Bennett had been speaking . He now added graciously : " If I have erred " " No . Let 's go out and look things over . " They looked things over , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Nauvoo and a powerful man in the city . But he was an obedient , almost an obsequious , lieutenant and Joseph was not alarmed . He took Bennett into his confidence and told him of plural marriage , and said Bennett could have as many wives as he wished . Bennettrubbed his hands again and smiled serenely upon the privilege . As a handsome man and the mayor of the city , he had an advantage over all other men but Joseph ; and he was quick to see it . Besides , he was tired of his wife . " I can understand , " he said softly , " that God finds it wise to restore the divine right of polygamy . " " I do not use that word , " said Joseph . " I think of it as celestial marriage . " " Of course , " said John . " How many celestial marriages have you  --  consummated ? " " I do not choose to tell . You are privileged to take as many wives as you please . " " Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Not yet . All the leaders but Brother Sidney are on missions  --  and Sidneyis too old . When the apostles return , I expect to tell them of God 's will in the matter . " " They 'll probably be astounded , " said John , with his soft sly smile . " Does your wife , Sister Emma , know of this ? " " No . Telling Emma is a problem I have postponed . " " I can understand that too , " said John ; but his voice said he intended no offense . " And speaking of Brother Sidney reminds me of his daughter . Nancy is very lovely . " " Yes , " said Joseph a little sharply . He had been thinking of her . " How old is she ? " " Sixteen , I think . " " Well , " said John , composing his face , " I 'll think it over . I 'm not at allp256sure , " he added , lying with the calmness of thirty years , " that I want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " It is your duty . It is God 's will . " " Yes , I can appreciate that . " Foreseeing that John might want Nancy for a wife , Joseph asked her to his study ; and after she had visited him twice and had listened to the glory of celestial marriage , Joseph rose one afternoon and went around his desk to her . " Sister Nancy , " he said , " I want to kiss you . " " Kiss me ! " she cried , starting up . " Yes , " he said , and reached for her hands . Dodging him , she ran to the door , only to find it locked . Trembling with fear and anger she turned to face him , with her head high and her throat crimson with shame . " Let me out of here ! " " No , Nancy . God intends for you to be one of my wives . " " Wives ! Then it 's true you have a lot of wives ! " " I have only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are to be " Unlock this door ! " " No . " " Then 1 ' 11 scream . I 'll tell the whole city about you . " " You would n't risk God 's anger , would you ? " " God 's anger ! " she cried scornfully . " Is n't my father second in command ? Why should God be angry with Sidney Rigdon 's daughter ? " " I , not your father , am the prophet . " " If you do n't open , " she said , stamping her foot , " I 'll scream ! I swear it by everything in heaven ! " Distressed , Joseph went over and unlocked the door , and watched Nancy flee like a wild thing . He returned to his desk , wondering what to do . Perhaps it would be best to write her a letter ; for after she had cooled off she would see the wisdom of his purpose and return to him in remorse . He wrote a long letter . He explained to her that what God commandedwas @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prejudice ; and asked her to pray and to consider the proposal calmly , not as a willful girl but as a saint resolved to do her duty . After he had dispatched the letter he was still worried : she was headstrongand violent like her father and as likely as not would try to set thep257whole city upon his head . Going alone to the river , Joseph knelt in prayer and asked God to reveal to Nancy the folly of her stubbornness . The next day he waited  --  and the next . It was not Nancy but her father who came on the third day . Sidney Rigdon was furious , and when furious , his huge ministerial face , with its great thrust of nose , its grotesquely wide upper lip and high forehead , his cold humorless eyes , made a picture that was terrifying . " Joseph , " he roared , " what is this I hear ? " " Brother Sidney , you 're agitated . Sit down . " " I do n't want to sit down ! What have you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ daughter ? You mean Nancy ? " " Of course I mean Nancy ! What did you mean by that letter you wrote ? " Joseph frowned thoughtfully . " As I remember it , Sidney , I was trying to explain to her some matters of church doctrine . She came to me " Yes , and you locked the door and tried to seduce her ! " " Seduce her ! Brother Sidney , you 're out of your mind again . " " I 'm in my mind all right . Do you deny you tried to kiss her ? " " I do . I asked her to kiss me . I was testing her virtue . Some of the sistersare getting careless . " " Yes , by God , they are ! Is it true you 're living in adultery with a flock of them ? " " Adultery ! " cried Joseph , horrified . " Sidney , you do n't seem to know what adultery is . " " Is it true , " Rigdon went on , almost slobbering with rage , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " I have several wives . " " Wives ! Do you think you 're Solomon ? " " I 'm a descendant of Joseph . It is God 's will . " " And you wanted Nancy for a mistress , did you ? It 's true , then , that you were seducing girls in Kirtland ! What Oliver Cowdery said  --  " " I 'm doing only what God commanded me to do . " " Such as kiss my daughter who 's only a child ! " " Sister Nancy is a very attractive young woman . " " You adulterous fraud ! " Rigdon howled , now beside himself . " I 'll have the church on you for this ! I 'll have you thrown out ! "  | " Brother Sidney , " said Joseph , his voice soft but dangerous , " you tried that once before . I forgave you and asked God to forgive you . Henceforth , you had better understand your position . " " Then I 'll leave the damned church ! " " Do as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time . What you know about me is a secret and I advise you to say nothing to anyone : " " What will the apostles say ? " " I 'll explain celestial marriage to them when they return . If you want several wives " One wife is enough for a God-fearing man ! " "  --  you may have them . You are a leader . The leaders are privileged because they will inherit a higher degree of glory . " " Other wives ! " cried Rigdon , aghast . He remembered that he was a much older man than Joseph . " One wife is all I care to have . " " That is for you to decide . " " How many concubines do you have in this building ? " " I resent that . These ladies are my wives , not concubines . " " Well , you leave my daughter alone . You understand that ? " " I have no wish to marry your daughter . " " I tell you , Joseph , that when the other leaders hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And what about the gentiles ? Are you trying to get us in jail again ? " " I am not afraid of our enemies . I have an army now . " Rigdon turned away , shaking his huge gloomy head . " I do n't like it . I think I 'll go to Pittsburgh . " After Rigdon left , Joseph thought the distressing episode was closed . He had forgotten John Bennett . And when , an hour later , that cunning man strode in , he was angry too , though anger with him was never more than tightness in his mouth and a sharper alertness in his eyes . " Joe , " he said insolently , " what is this I hear ? Have you been cutting shines around Nancy Rigdon ? " " My name is Joseph , not Joe . " " Joe or Joseph , it 's all the same to me . Did n't I tell you I want Nancy for one of my wives ? " " I do n't remember . But what if you did ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worldly man , Joe , and it takes sly skulduggeryto fool me . I 've been watching your monkeyshines. "  |p259Jose|ph  smiled faintly . " I 'll wrestle you for her . " " No , I 'm not fool enough to wrestle you . There are better ways in love and war . I told you a week ago I wanted Nancy . Why do you try to hog all the best women ? " Joseph was distressed by the man 's vulgar way of putting it . He was annoyed . The faint smile left his face . " I am the prophet , " he said . " Yes , " said Bennett softly , " but I 'm the mayor of Nauvoo . " " With my permission . " " Your permission ! If Nauvoo knew you have a harem , what would happen to your power ? " " You trying to threaten me ? " " No  --  not quite . We are both playing a game . You 're wise enough to know we 're in the same boat . If you start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " So you 're threatening me , " said Joseph , looking at Bennett 's immaculatewhiskers . " I 'm just saying I want Nancy Rigdon . " " Take her then . I do n't want her . " " But you tried to seduce her . " " That 's a lie ! " Joseph rose from his desk . He was angry now . " Do n't try to intimidate me . Any power you have in this city is the power I give you . I am the ruler here . If you can persuade Sister Nancy to marry you , do so . But do n't try to cause me any trouble " Sit down ! " cried Bennett impatiently . " Your high and mighty righteousnesshas never fooled me , Joseph . We are two of a kind . " " What do you mean ? " " I mean you do n't believe in Mormonism any more than I do . Like me , you saw in it an instrument of power . " " You 're blasphemous ! Do you mean  --  " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had better play the game together or we will both sink . But if we sink , you 'll sink deeper . I can run but you 'll have to stand up to the rack . " Joseph looked at Bennett , astonished by his perfidy . " Do you mean to tell me , Brother John , that when you joined my church you did so for your own worldly advantage ? " " My motive , " said Bennett blandly , " was about the same as yours . " " You Judas ! I 'll have you thrown out of the church and out of Illinois ! "  | " I would n't try any ringtail stuff , Joseph . It is an open and shut proposition . We are in the same boat and you 're rocking it . " " You 'll be lucky , " said Joseph , narrowing his gaze , " if you get out alive . " " Oh , indeed ! You mean Porter Rockwell , I suppose . " " I mean there are ways to handle a Judas . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had overplayed his hand . " I 'm sorry , " he said gently , " if I angered you . I was jesting . I wanted to test your emotional convictions in the matter . " " Now , " said Joseph , still gazing at the man , " you are adding lies to apostasy . " " No , my faith is firm . I just lost my head , Joseph . I wanted Nancy and I thought you were after her . " For a long moment the two men looked at one another . Joseph said : " If your heart is with God , you will remain in the church . If it is not , the sooner you get out of Ilinois , the better . " " My heart , " said Bennett , simulating anger , " is where yours is . You can count on me . " He went to the door and turned . " I should n't have jested about holy matters but I wanted to learn how strong your faith is . " Joseph did not have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he knew now beyond all doubt that he had made a mistake in this man . Bennett had not been jesting at all ; and he had gone away , not in shame , but to plot more cunningly . That Bennett could ruin him , Joseph knew well  --  unless the apostles stood behind their prophet . They were sailing home now . They would be here soon and they would find another crisis impending . They would come home to learn that the mayor of Nauvoo was a stealthy and cold-blooded rascal who had slipped like a Judas into Zion . Joseph knew that he would have to convince the apostles that plural marriage was approved by God ; he would have to enlist their support . Without it , he could not hope to survive this new storm that was gathering . Whether he could convince them , he did not know : he had worried about the matter , realizing that all of them would be appalled , that some of them would be very obstinate . He could not decide which to approach first : Brigham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brothers . In any case , he had to convince the twelve of the godliness of plural marriage , and persuade them to take other wives to themselves . For many days he considered the problem . He could turn to no onep261for counsel , nor did he wish to : he was not the frightened man who had been chased out of New York , out of Ohio , out of Missouri : he was thirtysevennow and confident of his power . He was the absolute dictator in this city . He had a well-trained army that would soon reach its quota of five thousand men . Both the Whigs and the Democrats fought for his favor . The ambitious Abraham Lincoln , the wily Stephen Douglas , and the governor of Illinois were glad to call him friend . His apostles had convertedthousands in England , and whole boatloads were embarking for Nauvoo ; and missionaries between Nauvoo and the Atlantic seaboard had converted other thousands and were establishing strong branches of the church . What had he to be afraid of ? He was the general of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political balance of a state and the prophet of God . There was nothing , it seemed to him , to be afraid of and he was not afraid . He waited confidently for the apostles to come home . P262HE DECIDED TO APPROACH HYRUM FIRST , HIS ONLY BROTHER WHO HADrisen to power in the church . Unlike William , who had trounced Joseph , Hyrum had always been loyal , never doubting the prophet 's wisdomor integrity ; but after hearing of plural marriage he was shocked speechless . His fair face turned ghastly pale and his blue eyes grew wide with horror . " What , " he gasped , " are you telling me ! " " The truth . I always speak the truth , Hyrum , when I speak as a prophet . " " Then you 're not speaking as a prophet now ! This is blasphemy ! " " No , Hyrum . It is God 's commandment to us . " " I ca n't believe it ! " Hyrum paced the floor , trembling and sick and horrified . " Do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do . " " Great God ! Joseph , this abominable doctrine will break up the church ! " " Nothing can break a church that God has founded . " " It will cost you your life ! It will be the death of all of us ! " " My life , Hyrum ? I 've always believed that I would pay for my ministry with my blood . But did n't Jesus ? And did you ever think that Jesus was crucified perhaps because He had many wives ? " " Jesus had many wives ! Joseph , are you insane ? " " I think Jesus had many wives . At least , several women loved Him . " " I tell you you 'll ruin the church with this doctrine ! " " It 's the Lord 's commandment , not mine . If you do n't believe , ask theLord yourself and He will make the truth known to you . " " I will ! " Hyrum cried , still pacing the room . " Then I 'll want you to help me convince @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nobody could convince Emma of anything . She ca n't pray . " " She must be convinced . If she is n't , she 'll raise Cain . She 'll blow the roof right off this building when she learns about me. "  | " I do n't doubt it . She 'll kill you . " " Kill me ? " said Joseph . He had not thought of that . " You argue with her , Hyrum , but we must convince the other apostles first . " " I 'm not convinced yet ! " cried Hyrum angrily . " You will be . You must pray . Go off alone and ask the Lord . " " Yes . " When he turned , his eyes were filled with tears . " Joseph , I 've never doubted you ; but God Himself must tell me before I can believe this . I 'll go away and humble myself in prayer . " Joseph put an arm around his brother . " Do so . Then come back . I will need your help with those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith Joseph had never doubted . He summoned him next . He was not prepared for his response ; for after listening to Joseph , after learning that God had commanded all the leaders to take other wives , the practical hard-headed Brigham bowed his face and wept . He did not shed tears . He shook with great dry sobs and hid his face in his hands . When he raised his face , it was haggard with anxiety and doubt . " Joseph , have you gone crazy ? " " No , Brigham . You have not studied your Bible well or you would know that plural marriage has always been commanded of God 's chosen people . " Like Hyrum , Brigham rose and paced the floor , his strong and unsentimentalface twitching with anguish . " I ca n't believe it ! " he cried again and again . " You will , Brigham , after you have humbled yourself in prayer . " " Damn it , I think you 're out of your wits ! Do you have several wives now ? " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm not a man to shrink from duty . I will do what God wants me to do . But this  --  damn it , this makes me want to  --  to be dead ! Never in my life before have I wanted to be dead ; but now I want to be in my grave and never get up , not even for the last bugle . I want a ton of sod piled on me and earth in my eyes . " " After you have humbled yourself and prayed and asked of God , you will know that I am right . " " I ca n't believe it . I wish I had never been born . " After pacing a few moments , he turned . " Who else has been taking a lot of wives ? " " Only John Bennett yet . "  | " I do n't like that man . Have you talked to any of the other apostles ? " " Only Hyrum . He humbled himself and God gave him a revelation . " " He did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brigham had never doubted Joseph as a prophet . He had questioned his wisdom in temporal but not in spiritual matters . Nevertheless , this was astounding doctrine , this notion that a man in this day and age could have many wives . He rubbed his perplexed brow and considered . " Listen well to this , " said Joseph . " We must keep this matter an absolute secret among the leaders until God tells me to reveal it to the world . If we do n't keep it secret " Why , " said Brigham , " we 'll be run out of here . You talked with Heber ? " " No . " " Talk to him . If you can convince him  --  but damn it to hell , you ca n't ! " Joseph was not prepared for the response of the tall dignified Heber Kimball . Heber looked as if he had heard a sermon by the Devil . He was so amazed that he could not speak , but only stared at Joseph , his incredulouseyes full of terrible pain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with his beard behaving as if minute invisible animals were running through it . Joseph rose and patted Heber 's shoulder but the man did not speak . He only gazed ahead of him , his eyes fixed in immutable horror . " Great God ! " he cried at last , as if he had seen the end of everything he had loved and fought for . Then , like Brigham , he bowed to his hands and shook with grief . Joseph looked at the bowed head and talked quietly , patiently , remindingHeber of ancient leaders who had many wives ; and pointing out that a saint 's pilgrimage to godhood depended largely on the number of his offspring . He told Heber the whole matter must be guarded as a secret for months and perhaps for years . Then he used an argument that was to be used again and again by him and the apostles . " Heber , if a man marries and his wife dies , it is all right to marry again . It is all right to marry a third , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rises in the next world , he will have five wives , wo n't he ? " " I had never thought of that . " " Does it matter , " Joseph went on , " whether he has five wives one at a time or five all at the same time ? They 'll all be with him in the nextp265life . If many wives are all right with God in the next life , why are they not all right in this one ? " " I had n't thought of it , " said Heber . " Think of it and you will understand the beauty and wisdom and necessity . Celestial marriage is only for the pure in heart who are also leaders . It is not for every man , Brother Heber . It is for those who will inherit celestial glory . It is your duty . " Heber rose . " I must think about it , " he said . " I will go and humble myself in prayer . " A few days later Heber 's daughter Helen came to Joseph @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she had been spending sleepless nights . " It 's about my father , " she said . " He is going insane . He ca n't eat , he ca n't sleep . He walks the floor all night . He wo n't tell Mama what the trouble is . He just wrings his hands and weeps , or he prays and then lies on the bed for hours and moans . He 's sick . But we do n't know what to do . " While she talked , Joseph studied her . He had been intending for some while to ask Helen to be one of his wives . He had nine now . Since marryingthe Huntington sisters , he had taken Eliza Snow , Sarah Whitney and Desdemona Fullmer . " I 'll tell you what is troubling your father , " he said . While he explained , she gazed at him with dark eyes that steadily filled with amazement . Then came horror and she began to weep . " There now , " he said , reaching over to pat her hands . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not seem for the best ; but God in His infinite wisdom is working for our salvation and happiness and glory . We must try to understand His purpose . When we understand , then we realize how ignorant we have been . " He assisted her to her feet and placed hands on her shoulders . " Helen , I want you to be one of my wives . " " I ! " she cried , shrinking from him . " I know you feel shocked . Your father did . I want you to go home and explain everything to your mother . Tell her to pray to God to show her what is right . And you pray , Helen . God will reveal the truth to you if you humble yourself . " Helen was backing away from him . " No wonder my father ca n't sleep ! No wonder he is losing his mind ! " " You do as I say . Tell your mother and then both of you pray for light . "  | " My poor father ! " The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for him but for what he had told her . " You must go home and pray , Helen . God will reveal to you the wisdomand glory of celestial marriage . " Slowly she had been backing away from him . When she reached the door she opened it and backed out , her gaze still on Joseph 's face . To his surprise , Helen returned within a week . She was radiant . Her mother , she said , had suffered terribly but she had prayed day and night ; and at last she had a vision in which the glory and truth of celestial marriage had been opened to her . She understood now how it would exalt her above most women in this life and in the next , what honor it would bring to her , and the greater glory that would come to her husband in a world without end . Her father was overjoyed too . " He knows it is right now , " said Helen . " We all know . We are very happy . " " Then you will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you want me . " Joseph rose without haste and came to her side . In her eyes he saw such happiness as he had never seen in human eyes before . " Come , " he said . One by one he convinced the apostles and a few other leaders and pledged them to secrecy ; and they began to take wives , though none took so many as the prophet himself . After marrying Helen , Joseph wedded the Partridge sisters , Emily and Eliza ; and then set his fancy on a lass of sixteennamed Lucy Walker . He was bolder now . He called Lucy to his study and went straight to the point . " I have a message for you , " he said , looking at the question in her clear gray eyes . " God has commanded me to take another wife and you are the woman . " He had seen surprise in women before but never such amazementas now left Lucy speechless . Her eyes opened wide and round ; her mouth opened and her shoulders sagged , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Do you consent ? " Lucy was too astounded to answer . She gaped helplessly while he explained . When he asked , " Do you believe I am a prophet ? " she gasped and looked more bewildered than ever . " What have you to say ? " Coming a little to her senses , she moistened her lips and made an effort to speak . Failing , she drew away from him , her eyes still wide andp267round , her mouth helplessly open . With a great effort she gasped : " Nothing ! " " You go home and pray , " he said gently . " You will receive a testimony from the Lord . " She continued to look at him as if hypnotized . When he opened the door for her , she suddenly came to life and fled . The next day Joseph called at the cabin where she lived alone . She had no parents . She had no one to turn to for advice ; but for hours she had been praying frantically , desperately , and looked now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was haggard because she had not slept . She was worn out from prayer and weeping and anguish of soul . " How are you ? " asked Joseph , smiling . " Will you marry me ? " " No . " " Have you prayed ? " " Yes . " " Have you received a testimony ? " " No . " " Have n't you received any answer to your prayers ? " " No . " " Then you must pray again . I warn you , Lucy : if you reject this commandment , heaven will be closed to you forever . " That statement did something to Lucy . She had been standing like a woman of stone , giving a yes or a no to everything he said ; but now she came to furious life . The astonishment left her eyes . They flashed with fire ; her lovely lips curled in bitter scorn . " Listen to me ! " she cried . " You 're a prophet but you ca n't make me marry you unless I know God wants @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " I did ! I prayed for hours . I do n't want you to speak to me about it . I wo n't marry you unless God commands me . I wo n't ! " Joseph was smiling . He looked very handsome today . " May God bless you , " he said . " You will receive a testimony . I 'll tell you what it will be . You will feel deeper joy and peace than you have ever felt . But you must first humble yourself in prayer . " " I did humble myself ! " she cried wildly . " I tell you I did ! " " Not enough . When you really humble yourself , God will make His will known to you . "  | " I do n't believe it ! " " Yes , it is so . You pray more earnestly . Then God will give you a testimony . " He smiled and bowed and left her . He almost forgot her in the days that followed . He was wooing several other girls , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Maria and Sarah Lawrence . Early one morning Lucy unexpectedly entered his study . She had been walking in the fresh air and looked very radiant . " Have you received a testimony ? " " Yes ! " she cried happily . " Night after night , " she went on , her words pouring out in almost breathless joy , " I prayed and prayed . I could n't sleep . I thought I would go mad . Then , just before daylight this morning , my room was all lit up . It was so bright I thought the sun had come up and I jumped out of bed but it was still dark outside . Then I knew what had happened . Oh , I was so full of holy peace ! I was so happy I went out to walk , just to be sure it was all true . " She advanced with hands on her breast , her gaze worshiping him . " You have received the testimony , " he said softly . " Sit here , Lucy , and I will bless @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laid his hands on her head . He blessed her with every blessing he could think of and then drew her to him . " We 'll be married now , " he said . He had nearly twenty wives now , all living in the big house as his nieces or adopted sisters . He had foreseen that the gaunt and embittered Emma would smell the deception eventually and demand to know where all these nieces and sisters were coming from . Nevertheless , he might have gone on for many years , cunningly deceiving her if his enemies had not loosed their tongues . John Bennett had been ousted from his position as mayor , and was now vindictively bent on Joseph 's ruin , telling all over Nauvoo that the prophet was a lecherous scoundrel . He said Joseph was seducing every girl he could get his carnal hands on . He even said that Joseph had been a lascivious villain from the beginning , and a fraud and a Judas as well . Other persons began to talk . When the stories came to Emma , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long sleep and went into her husband 's office . He heard her coming . He knew by her stride that she boded thunder and cyclone . When she strode in he rose and faced her , but he was not so calm as he seemed . " What 's this I hear about you ? " asked the embattled Emma . " I mean  |p269all  these women ! All these nieces and adopted sisters and charity cases ! So you 've been sleeping with them , have you ? You long-nosed fraud ! You low , scurvy hypocrite ! " " Watch your tongue , " he said . " You lustful devil out of hell ! So you 're a prophet , are you ? A prophet ! You mouth-almighty stinking rascal , that 's what you are ! Right in my house , right under my nose , you have a whole damned harem ! I could murder you ! " " Will you listen to reason ? " " You deceitful two-faced lying Judas ! Do you think I 'm a fool ? Why , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pulled the wool over my eyes ! The whole city " " If you 'll listen to me " Shut up ! " she yelled , her black eyes loathing him . " You clean the whole adulterous mess out of here or I 'll climb to a roof and tell the world about you ! You and your celestial wives ! You and your concubines ! I supposethe Lord gave you a revelation about this , did n't He ? " " He did . " " You liar ! " She advanced and breathed up into his pale face , her mouth snarling at him , her eyes black liquid contempt . " You adulterous sneaking skunk ! God never gave you a revelation in all your life ! You 've fooled others , you demon of lust , but you never fooled me ! I would have put up with it if you had n't moved your harem right into my house . " " Will you listen to reason ? " " I 'll listen to nothing ! You get these prostitutes out of here or I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moon ! You hear me ? Get the filthy wenches out of here ! " Joseph was a little angered . " If you try to ruin me , I 'll throw you out of the church . You 'll be damned forever . " " I want to be damned forever if I have to live with a houseful of bawds ! And do n't threaten me , Joe . " Her lips drew back in thin mockery . " You threaten others but I 'm up to your tricks . Throw me out of the church and I 'll tell everything I know about you . I 'll publish it all over the world . " Joseph sank to a chair . This violent woman had been a thorn in his side ever since he married her . He hardly knew what to do . " You were run out of New York , " she was saying , hissing at him . " Yougot in a big swindle and were chased out of Ohio . You got stuck in ap270dungeon in Missouri . You 'll get worse than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Do n't speak that way of my wives . " " Your wives ! " she said , snorting with mad wicked laughter . " They are all good pure women . " " God , yes ! Do the hypocrites want me to know about them ? Have n't they all been liars and pretenders right under my nose ? Nieces and sisters ! Good pure women , are they ? Since when have hypocrites been good pure women ? Listen , you lustful dog of a man , I do n't intend to argue with you . Get them out of here . " " All right , " said Joseph , mopping his brow , " I will . But I want to keep those who do n't have any place to live . " " They had a place before you smuggled them in here , did n't they ? " " They have no place now . " " Which ones ? " " Emily and Eliza for two . Let them stay and I 'll move the others . " " In God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Why  --  " he said , trying to remember . " You ca n't tell how many ! " Her mad laugh rang again . " You mean you have so damned many concubines you 've forgotten the number ? Well , I guess Solomon forgot too ! And what are you going to do with all the babies ? Unless my eyes lie like you do , a lot of these nieces and sisters  --  or , " she asked witheringly , " are they just getting fat ? " " Emma , I wish you 'd think it over . I ca n't move them out into the street . " " That 's where prostitutes belong . " " Silence ! " Joseph roared . " I 'll not allow you to speak that way of good women . " " Shut up . Get them out of here . " " You think it over . You are very uncharitable . " Emma thought it over and returned to say that Eliza and Emily could remain if he took the others out at once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to find his wives . Some , like Lucy and Helen , smilingly assented and others protested ; but they all yielded to his will and gathered their few belongings and went to the homes of relatives or friends . It was absurd , Joseph reflected , to allow the hard-bitten Emma to drive his wives out.  |p271He  had other worries . The unscrupulous John Bennett was trying to split the church wide open and to become the leader of a dominant faction . Stories of celestial wives had reached the gentiles ; there were angry mutteringsthroughout Illinois . There was unrest among the saints , too , and some of them in disgust were leaving the church . Others were furious because the privilege of plural marriage had not been given to all members . In every day now , angry men came to Joseph 's study to argue with him , or to heap abuse and threaten . There was Tim McBride . He stalked in with his honest red face full of woe and wrath . Scowling at Joseph , he asked : " You remember me ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so many persons . " " I 'm Timothy McBride . I talked with you just before you went to jail . " " Yes , I remember now . Will you sit down ? " " I'n say what I have to say just as well standing up . " " What is the trouble ? " " All this polygamy is the trouble . I did n't believe it until last week . I mean I thought it was a wagonload of lies . " " It is , Brother Timothy . " " It is n't ! You know Lucy Ann Decker ? " " I think I 've met Sister Lucy . " " Well , Lucy Ann and me , we 've been engaged . We was to be married when I got a house built . " " That 's very good . Do you have the house built ? " " Built , hell ! " cried Tim , almost purple with disgust . " Yes , damn it , I got it built . And then what happened ? " " What ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ comes along and says Lucy is to be one of his wives ! He tells her she 'll have more glory in the next world if she marries him . So what does she do ? She shines right up and marries him ! " " Well , there are other girls " Why did n't he marry them ? Lucy was mine . Did n't I save her life one night ? Did n't I help her out of Missouri ? " " Brother Brigham is right . Sister Lucy will share more glory in the next life as one of his wives . " " To hell with glory ! What about me ? What about Jack Daggett ? He had a girl and along comes Heber Kimball and marries her . What aboutp272Jonas Littleton ? Ai n't Parley Pratt marrying his girl ? It 's all mighty nice for you and the apostles but what about us ? " Tim drew a long handkerchief and snorted into it furiously . He looked up . " What about me ? " he said . " You must understand that it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ oppose the Almighty ? " " No , I would n't . But I do n't think the Almighty ever meant me to lose my girl . If He did , then I do n't think a hell of a lot of the Almighty . " " You are being blasphemous . " " By God , I should a-stayed with the Danites who became apostates , I guess . I should a-knowed there was something crooked about the whole business . " " Silence ! " Joseph rose and faced the man and Timothy was overwhelmedby his bearing . " Do you believe I am a prophet ? " " I guess I do . " " I say to you it is God 's will for Brigham to marry Lucy Ann and for you to marry some other woman . " " It do n't look right to me , " said Tim stubbornly . " Many things may not look right to you or to all of us . I advise you to go off by yourself and pray . " " I 'd rather fight , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You will see the light and you will under-stand . " " I 'll try , " Tim said , " but I do n't think it will do a damn bit of good . My father do n't either . " " Who is your father ? " " Moroni McBride . You saw him in Far West . " " Brother Timothy , you should not have told your father about this . Celestial marriage is a secret " The whole city is talking about it ! " " I know that . But it is a secret , just the same . " " Are you lying about it ? If persons ask you if it 's true , do you say no ? " Joseph hesitated . " Yes , Brother Timothy . We must not tell the truth until God reveals to me that I am to make celestial marriage known . Tell your father to say nothing about it . " " You mean to tell me , " asked Tim , amazed , " that a prophet of God tells lies ?  | " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I tell you again to pray and God will make His will known to you . " " I do n't think so . And I do n't think God intends His prophet to be a liar . " " Brother Timothy , that will do . You may go now . " Joseph followed him to the door . " Say nothing about this to anyone . If your father would like to take another wife " He would n't ! My mother is his wife . " " If he should , tell him to come to me . " Joseph soon forgot such trivial matters . He had bigger worries . Bennett was telling that licentiousness was rampant in the Mormon city , and was inciting men to organize and march on the town . More serious still , at least for the moment , was an attempt to assassinate Governor Boggs in Missouri . While sitting by his window one night he was shot by an unknownman outside ; and the Missouri newspapers declared in great black headlines that Porter Rockwell had been the skulking would-be assassin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were placed on the heads of both men , and posses came from Missouri to Nauvoo to capture the prophet . " Missouri is demanding your extradition ! " cried Brigham , bursting into the study . " You 'd better hide . " " Hide , when I have an army of several thousand men ? " " Right now it 's better to hide than to fight . If we fight , Illinois will be up in arms too . If we hide , the matter might blow over . " " I 'm tired of running . I 've been running from place to place for twenty years . " He led Brigham to a west window and looked out . " We should have gone yonder . " " Yes , to the Rocky Mountains or Oregon . " " Somewhere . " " We 're headed for trouble again , Joseph . Celestial marriage is going to be our downfall . " " Brigham , is your faith weak ? What God commands , we do . " " But we ca n't keep it a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it ? " " Until God tells us to stop lying . " " It would have been better to go west . It 's plural marriage causing the mobs to form again . We can lie and lie but they do n't believe us . " " We have an army . "  | " An army would be all right in the Rocky Mountains . Here it will just bring the government down on us . Besides , you ca n't fight bandits with an army . " " Too many of the brethren talk too much . " " It 's the women . Do n't you know that women ca n't keep a secret  --  especiallywhen they learn their husband has another wife ? " " We must rebuke the sisters . " " Yes , and they 'll gossip all the harder . " " Brigham , I do not intend to run again . " " But hide , Joseph . Let 's see if it wo n't blow over . " For a month Joseph hid , going stealthily from home to home ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and crawling like a hunted thing into the next . It seemed stupid to him for a prophet of God , with a trained army at his call , to sneak around like a thief  --  and all because bandits from Missouri had come here to get him . He felt great wrath and now and then resolved to march forth and defy the world ; but always one of his leaders slipped in to counsel him , to argue , to imploresecrecy , and to report what was happening . Porter Rockwell had escaped from Missouri and had fled to the East . Here in Nauvoo were sheriffs with warrants : they were offering a huge sum of money to anyone who would betray Joseph and point out his hiding place ; but every saint approached told them to go to hell and be damned . These reports brought tears to Joseph 's eyes . " Thank God for their loyalty ! But why should I hide like a fox ? I 'd rather march out at the head of my army . " " No . " It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enough  --  and plenty of it . It 's celestial marriage that has brought our enemies down on us . I 'm afraid it was a mistake . " " A revelation from God can not be a mistake . " " Just the same , I 'm having an awful time myself . When my wife finds out I have other wives I think she will murder me . Anyhow , I can see no way out of this mess . " " We 'll fight our way out . " " But we ca n't fight the government . Joseph , do n't you think it would be best to sell our property and go to the Rocky Mountains ? " " No . I 'm sick of running . I 'm going to fight it out right here . "  | " But we ca n't fight mobs with an army . They 're already beginning to burn our haystacks out in the country . They 'll sneak in here and burn our homes . It will be Missouri all over again . " " I wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this nation protects us in our conscience and form of worship and in our rights . If the United States wo n't defend free men , we 'll defend ourselves . " " But we ca n't , Joseph . We ca n't fight mobs except with mobs . " " Do n't argue with me , Parley . I tell you I am going to fight . " " If we had kept celestial marriage a secret , we 'd be all right . John Bennettbetrayed us . " " He 's a Judas . He will burn in hell forever . " " Well , you stay in hiding a while longer . We 'll wait and see what happens . " But Joseph did not stay in hiding . Unexpectedly one day he marched boldly forth and summoned his people in a huge meeting . He had donned his uniform of lieutenant-general in the Legion and looked very regal in his tight breeches and swallow-tail coat , ornamented with glitteringbraid . He mounted a platform ; and those closest to him saw that he was very angry , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ My people , " he said , lifting a hand to still the cheering , " I am tired of arrests and writs and trials and dungeons . I 'm tired of hiding out like a coyote . And to you I say this : if any citizens of Illinois say we shall not have our rights , treat them as strangers and not friends , and let them go to hell and be damned ! If we have to give up our chartered rights , privileges , and freedom , which our fathers fought , bled and died for , and which the Constitution of the United States and of this state guarantees unto us , we will do it only at the point of the sword and the bayonet ! " I tell you before I will bear this unhallowed persecution any longer  --  before I will be dragged away again among my enemies for trial , I will spill the last drop of blood in my veins , and will see all my enemies in hell ! To bear it any longer would be a sin , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bear it any longer ? " He waited . For a moment there was silence . Then a voice shouted . " No ! " and " NO ! " rolled in thunder from eight thousand throats . " I say in the name of Jesus Christ by the authority of the holy priesthood , I this day turn the key that opens the heavens to restrain you no longer from this time forth ! I will lead you to the battle ; and if you arep276not afraid to die , and feel disposed to spill your blood in your own defense , you will not offend me . Be not the aggressor : bear until they strike you on the one cheek ; then offer the other , and they will be sure to strike that . Then defend yourselves and God will bear you off , and you shall stand forth clear before His tribunal . If mobs come upon you any more here , dung your gardens with them ! . . . It was the boldest speech they had ever heard from their prophet . Some thought @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; others compared him with the Caesars or with prophets of old ; and all of them , after his fiery words had been spoken , sent up a shout that rocked the city . Here at last was the fighter . Here was no academic man who sat in a study translating ancient records or studying Hebrew and Greek . No : here , they told themselves , pressing forward to touch him or to swear allegiance , was a fighting prophet , ready to lead his people and shed his blood . " Glory be ! " the great throng roared ; and for a day and a night the city went mad with joy.  | THERE WERE CALMER AND WISER HEADS THAN JOSEPH 'S . BRIGHAM SAW DISasterahead and wished the saints had gone out of the United States and into the Rocky Mountain wilderness . Parley had a sense of the ironic ; and often he was amused , while walking the streets in dark nights , to see the other apostles , or sometimes Joseph , skulking along fearfullyto visit their wives . Often now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ protect them on their nocturnal prowls ; and often Parley grinned , while himself on his way to visit a bride , to see Joseph or Brigham or Heber darting among shadows in the company of armed men . But Parley did not grin when his brother Orson returned from Jerusalem and looked around him . Orson was as angry as a man could be . He had spent a weary time in the Holy Land , learning a strange language and trying to convert a strange people ; and he came home to learn that his wife had almost been driven out of the church , and that she and her children had nearly starved . When he strode into Joseph 's study , he was the most furious man Joseph had ever seen . " Brother Orson , " he said , rising , " you seem disturbed . " " Disturbed ! " roared Orson , choking with wrath and insult . " By the living God , for a cent I 'd tear your heart out ! " " It would take a better man than you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . " So , " he howled at last , " you tried to seduce my wife while I was gone , did you ? You black-hearted villain ! " " You are out of your mind . " " And when she kicked you out of the house , you tried to starve her to death ! You let my wife and children starve and freeze ! That 's why you sent me on a mission , you devil out of hell ! " " Calm yourself , " said Joseph impatiently . " You are talking like a lunatic . "  | " You long-nosed hypocrite ! Do you deny that you tried to seduce my wife ? " " Of course I deny it . " " You add lying to seduction , do you ? " " I made no attempt on your wife or any other wife . " " You liar ! " " Be careful with your tongue . Your wife has inflamed your mind with falsehoods . " " My wife never lies . What she has told me is true @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I say again you 're a liar ! " " If you doubt me , " said Joseph , trying to control his temper , " ask Parley . Your brother will tell you what is true . " " Oh , Parley ! Parley thinks you 're the Almighty Himself . He believes you in everything . " " He knows that I am a prophet . " " You 're an infernal scoundrel ! " " Brother Orson , beware . If you insist on being foolish , you will be ex-communicated . " " Excommunicate me and be damned ! The church stinks anyway . You 've ruined it . From its high purpose you 've turned it into a whore-house . " " Brother Orson , " said Joseph advancing , " close your blasphemous mouth before I shut it for you . This is no time for petty strife . Our enemies are closing in around us . I came here today and expect to be arrested any minute . We have bigger worries than the trivial delusions of your wife . " For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Then Orson falteredand turned away . There came to him overwhelmingly for a moment his old belief in the goodness of this prophet and king . " I still believe my wife , " he said . After Orson had gone , Joseph looked through a window at this city which his genius had built in a swamp . He felt frightened and a little sick : he could endure the persecution of his enemies but not the faithlessnessof his friends . He sent for Parley . When Parley entered , he came in quietly , looking as if he were ready to weep or to laugh . He sat and mopped his brow . " Did you convince Orson ? "  | " No , Parley . See if you can reason with him . " " I ca n't . I 've tried . " " Try again . It 's enough to have John Bennett raising Cain . We do n't want Orson going over to our enemies . " " He believes his wife . I do n't think anybody can change his mind . " " Try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Almighty could reason with him . " " I wish he 'd go to Pittsburgh and stay there . We should throw him out of the church . " " It might be just as well . Maybe it would bring him to his senses . " For a long moment Parley gazed at Joseph and then broke into hearty laughter . " Dodgast it , " he said , " we have to laugh once in a while . It 's the only way to get rid of trouble . " " Parley , I 'm going to run for President of the United States . " " You ? " asked Parley , astounded . " Yes . Why not ? " " But why ? You would n't carry a single state . " " I might be elected . " Whether Joseph spoke slyly , Parley did not know . " You could try . It seems to me , though , there 's enough trouble here to keep you busy . " " If I run for President , it might get our enemies off @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Parley , recognizing shrewd statesmanship in that . " But what are you going to do about our troubles here ? We 're headed for another downfall . The Masons are getting up in arms . They say we stole their ritual for our temple services . And our celestial wives " It 's that cur of a Bennett . He 's causing all the trouble . " " Not all of it . Rigdon is misbehaving again . " " He wants to be the prophet . " " He told me you tried to seduce his daughter . " " The church is full of liars , Parley . As for Rigdon , I 've washed my hands of him . If the rest of you want to put up with him , do it , but I wo n't . " Joseph went to a window and looked out . His kingdom here was only a small one : he was lord of a city and an army and twenty thousand persons but he had dreamed of a vast empire . He was hungry for a greater destiny @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ We 've worn out our welcome in Illinois . What are we going to do ? Celestial marriage has ruined us . " " It 's not that . It 's the wickedness of the people . " " It 's envy . They 're saying you have a thousand wives . " Parley waited a moment ; and when Joseph did not speak , he asked : " How many do you have ? " " Only twenty-four  --  or maybe it 's twenty-five . " Parley grinned . He had only a half-dozen and was not sure that he wanted more . He wondered what he would do with twenty-five and how he could support them . He sighed . It made him shiver a little to think what his first wife would say when she learned of the others . " We should have gone west . " " Yes , " said Joseph , gazing outside and remembering the cowardice of Calhoun and Clay , or thinking with scorn of the pusillanimous little man who sat in the White House . " Let 's go now , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to run for President . " " We should go now , " said Parley , folding arms over a belly that was growing plump . " In Oregon we can live as we please . " " We 'll go to Oregon in a few years . " " In a few years , Joseph , we wo n't be alive to go anywhere . I 'm no prophet . I 've never been able to get close to the Lord like you . But in my old bones I know that what we 've been through is just a sip from the pot of vinegar we 'll be drinking soon . " " Are you losing your faith ? " asked Joseph , turning to look at his apostle . " No . But we ca n't fight Missouri and Illinois and the Masons and all the mobs . Not even with an army . Brigham thinks we should go now . So do Heber and others . Brigham says if we do n't go now , we should use strong-arm methods . " " What kind ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ones of us who got anywhere . The rest of us landed in jail . I like peace but Brigham says the time has come to flee or to fight . " " We 'll fight , " said Joseph , still gazing at the city . " But not in the open . We 'd be whipped before we got started . " " You mean Brigham thinks we should use guerrilla tactics ? " " Yes . That 's how I understood him . "  |p281Jose|ph  turned from the window to look at Parley . " Go find Brigham , " he said . Whether or not he really liked Brigham Young , Joseph had never decided . He envied the man . He envied Brigham 's shrewd appraisal of human beings , his statesmanship , his hard commonsense : while the other leaders sat in dungeons , waiting for the firing squads , Brigham had been a Moses to a fleeing people . He had said ( but not to Joseph ) : " I 'll just set around and wait , and when you all get dumped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He was that kind of man . He made friends of men whose friendship was needed . It was rumored that he made short work of skulking enemies who stood in his way . Yes , Joseph envied and admiredthe man but he had always been a little afraid of him . When Brigham entered , Joseph looked at him curiously . " How are you today ? " " I could feel a damn sight better . We ca n't keep plural marriage a secret . We can lie about it and fool most of the saints  --  but not all of them . One by one they 'll find out . " " What is the trouble ? " " Is there anything anywhere that is n't trouble ? " Joseph gazed at Brigham 's strong determined face , convinced that he was the greatest statesman in the clan . " I 've talked with Parley . He thinks we 're headed for disaster . " " I know it . We should- have gone west . " " We 've been driven out of three states . Are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Joseph laid clenched hands on his desk . " Brigham , I prefer to fight , to lead my people , to shed my blood . " " You 'll be shedding it soon enough . " " I 'm tired of running . " " I'n understand that . But even with an army of five thousand men , we 'd be whipped before we could say absquatulate . There are mobs all around us . We ca n't fight bandits and brigands with an army . Besides , " he added , lowering his voice , " there are traitors in our midst . " " Yes , I know that . " " And the number is growing . " " God save me ! " cried Joseph . " Even my counselors turn against me . One by one , they all plot my downfall . Perhaps , " he said , looking intently at Brigham , " even you . "  | " No , Joseph . You can count on me and Heber and Parley and John Taylor  --  and many more . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ high places . I knew John Bennett was a villain the moment I saw him . I never trusted Rigdon as far as I could walk on greased lightning . " " They all betray me . " " You should n't put ambitious men in high places . And since I 'm being plain-spoken , I want to say this : you ca n't build a kingdom with gentleness . Even the Almighty could n't do that . He did n't show much mercy to His enemies  --  so why should we ? " " What , " asked Joseph , " do you mean ? " " I mean we have some bold men we could use to sock away these mob leaders . " " You mean ? " " This is how I see it . God has commanded you to build up the only true church . Are you going to let ungodly brigands undo everything ? Do you think the Lord wants you to let these hellhounds destroy His church ? I do n't . I think it would be all right with God if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " asked Joseph , gazing intently at Brigham . " There are ways , " said Brigham , his eyes turning cold . " Take Porter Rockwell : we have a lot of men like him . And where is Bill Hickman ? " " I have n't seen him since we left Missouri . " " We need him . Let 's find him . He did some good work over in Missouri . He 's as brave a man as ever fired a gun , and he can keep his mouth shut . I do n't know whether he was with the Danites or not but I know he can be counted on to do a tough job . If we put some of these mob leaders out of the fight " But what 's the matter with my army ? I have soldiers , armed and ready , and I am ready to lead them . " " Yes , " said Brigham impatiently . " But you ca n't fight coyotes with an army . Besides , the State militia would march in , just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the United States would send an army out here and then what would we do ? We ca n't go to war against our country . " " We could fight until we were all killed . That would be better than to hide out like wicked sinners . " " But our job is to build the Lord 's church . As long as the Almighty is on our side , we must build it in any way we can . "  | " But my army ! " For a moment Joseph was lost in thought , seeing himself in his splendid uniform at the head of his troops . " I think , " he said at last , " I should flee to the west . " " Not now . If you went now the church would go to pieces . " " If I am not to flee or lead my army , I see nothing else to be done . " " We must fight our enemies with their own methods . Choose forty of our bravest men to patrol Nauvoo day and night . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them up and give them a free grave in the Mississippi . Send Porter and some other scouts into the country to give daily reports of movements there . " Brigham paused , reflectingon what he would do if he were in Joseph 's place . " If worst comes to worst , use up the mob leaders and dung our gardens with them as you said we would . " Joseph turned . " I 'll put Nauvoo under martial law . Send Brother Porter in to see me . " After hesitating a long moment , he walked over and faced Brigham . " I feel that my end is near . If I am murdered , I want my brother Hyrum to succeed me . Will you remember that ? " " Yes . " " I 'm going to send Hyrum back cast where he will be safe . I think you and the other apostles should go , too . It 's my blood they want . When I am dead , perhaps they will leave my people in peace . " " They want more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ us . So let us fight while we can  --  and fight in the only way we can . " Joseph rose to his fullest height . " Send Porter Rockwell to me . " Porter 's entrance a little later was enough to startle anyone : it brought Joseph to his feet with a greeting that was almost a cry of alarm . Because Porter , with his black-bearded face , his tangled uncut hair , and his way of moving as if he had been propelled by a cannon , presented the most terrifyingaspect of any saint in Nauvoo . " How are you ? " he asked , his voice booming in welcome . " Full of grief , Brother Porter . " " That 's too dodrotted bad , " said Porter , who always softened his oathsaround the prophet . He sank to a chair , looking like a wild man out ofa jungle , and spread his whiskered face in a grin . " All these damn bilksand swag-bellies and blowhards and Missouri pukes hangun aroundNauvoo , I guess . All our enemies is on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ time , but they 're as slick as greased lightning on a banana peel . It looks like we got a-fight . " " Tell me , Porter , what 's happening . " " Well , it 's plenty . The whole gallows-faced pack is just a-holdun back like all wrath right now , a-waitun for a chance to draw a bead . They 're all as mad as a settun hen yanked off of her nest and throwed out into a rainstorm . There 's big mobs and little mobs , just like there was in Missouri . They swear by hell and high principles that all the saints is darkcullswith as many concubines apiece as Solomon had . You ca n't tell them no different . " " About how many men are there in the mobs ? " " I do n't know but there 's thousands . And they 're armed to the teeth . Some of them have so blasted many smoke-pistols that they fall down under the load . But the worst thing is the Judases right here in Zion . If you had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then we might not a-got in all this trouble . " " Brother Porter , is it true that you went down in Missouri and shot Governor Boggs ? " Porter 's hands dropped to his pistols . " Do n't you ask me no questions and I 'll tell you no lies . Mebbe I did and mebbe I did n't . But if I did , I 'm plumb ashamed of myself that my aim was n't no better . I hear that the bastard got well . " " For shame , Brother Porter . We saints are not murderers . " " Well , " said Porter , turning in his chair , " I do n't figger it 's murder to use up a skunk . Them-there pukes clown there should ought to be put away . They ai n't no earthly good to anyone . And right now they 're sneakun around in Nauvoo and they 'll grab you the first chance they get . You wo n't never get out of jail alive this time . I do n't think you 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ should go west . Would you go with me ? " " Hell amighty , yes . I 'd go with you right into the barrel of a cannon . " Joseph considered . Here was a man , he reflected , in whom he could place absolute trust . He did not want to be mayor of Nauvoo or general in the Nauvoo Legion or prophet of God . " I want you to act as scout outside of the city and learn what is going on . " I know already . The mobs is ready to move in and burn the city . Ever  |p285since  that what's-his-name started his dirty newspaper and you junked his press , well , that give outsiders an excuse to have you arrested . That 's what they want . They want to get their hands on you . Then they'n say you tried to escape and they'n shoot you and you wo n't get no trial this time . I thought it all out and I just about got my mind made up the best thing you'n do is hit the grit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went to a window and looked at the temple which stood northward upon a hill . " I do n't want to run away , " he said . " We came here and took a worthless swamp and built a city on it . How can I give up everything here that I have worked for ? " " Well , if you fight , you could count on me to use up a lot of them before they knowed what it was all about . " " Porter , I think I 'll send all the apostles back east where they 'll be safe . Then I do n't know what I 'll do . But I want you to find out every day what 's going on and come and tell me . If officers come with warrants Erom Missouri or anywhere else , you let me know in time . " " I will . " Porter rose and then hesitated . " You would n't care , I guess , if I socked John Bennett away . " " Do n't do that . It would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Porter , shaking his shaggy head , " I guess it would . Well , I 'll keep my eyes peeled and let you know . " Joseph sent the apostles eastward  --  or at least those who would go ; and the sleepless days and nights that followed he spent alone , alternating between anger and despair . The city was under martial law . At the door of the house in which he was hiding , he had a heavy guard posted . When he felt premonition of impending doom , he strove to shake it off by remembering his loyal army ; but in the next hour he would think of all the known and unknown traitors in his midst , of every Judas who was trying to dethrone him and usurp his power . Night after night he sat and pondered , or rose to gaze at the dusky and beautiful city which his genius had built . Perhaps it would soon be laid in flaming waste ; his wives would be raped and his children murdered ; and his people would he scattered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no courage in those governing Illinois or the nation . He sat at his desk and looked through various papers , wondering whichto leave and which to destroy ; and , while searching , he came upon copiesof letters he had written to Calhoun and Clay . He had asked what theirp286course would be in regard to the Mormons if they were elected to the presidency . Calhoun had written : " But as you refer to the case of Missouri , candor compels me to repeat what I said to you at Washington , that , according to my views , the case does not come within the jurisdiction of the federal government , which is one of limited and specific powers . " To that Joseph had answered scathingly : " Before you let your candor compel you again to write upon a subject as great as the salvation of man , I would admonish you to read in the eighth section and first article of the Constitution , the first , fourteenthand seventeenth specific ' and not very limited powers ' of the federalgovernment , what can be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a virtuous people , when the administrators of the law are unboughtby bribes , uncorrupted by patronage , untempted by gold ! " Henry Clay had written : " Should I be a candidate , I can enter into no engagements , make no promises , give no pledges to any particular portion of the people . I must go into that high office with no guarantees but such as are to be drawn from my whole life , character and conduct . " To that , Joseph had sent the most violent letter of his life . " Your whole life , characterand conduct have been spotted with deeds that cause a blush upon the face of a virtuous patriot . So you must be contented in your lot , while crime , cowardice , cupidity or low cunning have handed you down from the high office of a statesman to the blackhole of a gambler ! " In reading his answers now , he was distressed by their bitterness ; but just the same , there was no courage left in the leadership of a nation which had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than fifteen years , he and his people had been driven from place to place , raped and murdered , persecuted and destroyed . The Constitution had become a document that political demagogues praised and paid no attention to ; and presidents like Van Buren , statesmen like Clay and Calhoun , exploited prejudice and hatred and mocked the founders of a great republic . There was no haven in the States more than there had been in the Old World for a people who chose to worship God according to their conscience . Joseph knelt in prayer and rose after an hour feeling strengthened . Then he went to the window and looked across at the magnificent templewhich his people were building ; and there came to him the feeling that he must march at the head of his army and die at the point of ap287sword . Having resolved on this desperate course , he lay clothed on a couch and slept . In the morning he put on his uniform of lieutenant-general of the Legion and summoned the army and all the saints in Nauvoo and climbed to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he looked down at the thousands of faces that gazed up at him and waited . " My brothers and sisters , we are American citizens . We live upon a soil for the liberties of which our fathers periled their lives and spilled their blood upon the battlefield . Will you stand by me to the death , and sustain at the peril of our lives the laws of our country , and the liberties and privileges which our fathers have transmitted unto us , sealed with their sacred blood ? " The multitude roared a mighty assent . " I call upon all men from Maine to the Rocky Mountains , and from Mexico to British America , whose hearts thrill with horror to behold the rights of free men trampled under foot , to come to the deliverance of this people from the cruel hand of oppression , cruelty , anarchy and misrule ! I call upon God and angels to witness that I have unsheathed my sword with a firm and unalterable determination that this people shall have their legal rights and shall be protected from mob @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ground like water , and my body be consignedto the silent tomb ! ... " When his ringing challenge was done , there was a stupendous roar of approval ; and then the band broke into martial music and the multitude into song . The great Legion , uniformed and armed and ready , stood at attention while their leader came down from the roof . The prophet was ready to lead his people . The saints were going to war.  |p288JOSEPH  DID NOT KNOW THAT EVEN WHILE HE WAS SPEAKING TO HIS PEOPLE , the timid and academic governor of Illinois was hurrying to Carthage where the prophet 's bitterest enemies had gathered . Petitions and committeesand threats had driven Governor Ford to action ; and at once he dispatched messengers to Nauvoo , demanding Joseph 's surrender , as well as the surrender of every other man " who has committed gross outrage upon the law and liberties of the people , and violated the Constitution . " When Joseph read that , he took his brother Hyrum aside . " You go to Cincinnati . I am lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Hyrum , you must go . You must live to avenge my blood and lead the people . " " I tell you I wo n't leave . I 'll die with you . " " There 's no wisdom in that . As your leader I must command you to go . " " I 'm sorry , " said Hyrum stubbornly , " but this time I ca n't obey you . " " Do you realize , " asked Joseph impatiently , " that I am going to be murdered ? You are to be my successor . Your life is not safe here . You must go where it will be safe and leave me to my enemies . " " I 'm sorry , " said Hyrum again , " but I refuse to leave you . If you are to die , we will die together . " Joseph turned to the messenger . " How soon will the posse be over after me ? " " Today , I think . " Joseph picked up a letter from Governor Ford and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pledges his honor and the honor of Illinois to protect me if I will go to Carthage and stand trial for treason . But that , " he said bitterly , " is a lie . I 'll soon be a dead man . Brother William , fetch me paper and pen . " When these were brought , Joseph wrote a letter to Governor Ford . In it he said : " We are left to the mercy of the merciless . Sir , we dare not come , for  |p289our  lives would be in danger , and we are guilty of no crime . " He read the letter aloud . " William , is it not so ? " " Yes , " said William Clayton . Joseph asked the messenger to leave . Then he said : " Brother William , what do you think I should do ? " " I think , " said Clayton , observing that Joseph 's hands were trembling , " that you should go west with Hyrum . The rest of us could follow later . " " Porter , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think . Get away from these-here pukes and bandits . " " Will you go with me ? " " By God , yes . I 'll go with you anywhere . " Joseph went to a window to gaze at the city he had built . " And leaveall that ? We have spent five years building our homes here . " " If you stay , " said Clayton , " our homes will be in ashes . What happened in Missouri will happen again . " " Has word been sent to the apostles to come home ? " " Yes . But not to Sidney Rigdon . " " Oh , let him stay in Pittsburgh and save his precious hide ! Porter , are you sure the mobs are ready to move in ? " " There ai n't no doubt about it . " " And Governor Ford is waiting in Carthage to grab me . I wo n't get a fair trial any more than I did in Missouri . I 'll be killed , or thrown into a dungeon for the rest of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Clayton . " God did not save Jesus when His time had come . I 've always felt I would have to pay for my ministry with my blood . " Joseph placed hands on his desk and considered . They trembled so that he removed them from sight of the men watching him . " I will give myself up , " he said at last , " and Hyrum will go with me . Porter will be our guide . Get everything ready . " He turned again to the window . He was now trembling from head to feet . " Yes , I 'll go . I 'd rather march at the head of my army than sneak off to let my enemies kill me . But when I am dead , perhaps they will spare the rest of you . " " But why , " asked Clayton , " do n't you go west ? " " They would overtake me . They 'd have a good excuse to murder me then . " " By God , no , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ promise you that . "  | " If Brigham was here , he 'd tell you to go west . " " Yes , Brother Brigham would . " " Then go west . It 's your only chance . " Joseph hesitated . " All right , " he said , " I will . Get the horses ready at once . " He went to Emma 's room . " I 'm leaving for the west today . " " That does n't surprise me . I always thought you 'd run away and leave me to be murdered . " " You wo n't be murdered . " " Of course I will . We 'll all be killed . All except you  --  you 'll save your own skin all right ! You 're a coward . If you are n't , then why are you shaking all over ? " " Shaking ? " he said , and held up his hands . " Yes , it 's true . But I 'm not afraid . " " If you had n't got a whole lot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It was the Lord 's will . And they 're not concubines . They 're my wives . " " I guess it 's the Lord 's will for us all to be slaughtered ! " " It 's me and Hyrum the mob wants . If we leave  --  " " Then they 'll butcher the rest of us . Why do n't you stay and face the music ? Why do you run away like a coward ? " He sank to a chair and looked at her with haunted eyes . " We 'll go , Emma , and the saints can sell their property and follow . We 'll build our kingdom in the West . " " You 're a coward , " said Emma scornfully . " You 're unfair . I want to lead my army but others think I should leave . Governor Ford is in Carthage now and is sending a posse over to get me . " " If you are n't here he 'll hang me in your place . " " Not a hair of your head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Emma rocked in her chair like an embittered grandmother . She gazed at him , her thin lips curling , her black eyes hating him . " Just run along and leave us all to be killed . I 'd as soon be dead anyhow as to sit around and see you marry every woman in Nauvoo . You have twenty-seven wives . Did you have to have so many ? " " You will join me later , " he said quietly , and entered another room to change his clothes . Long after dark , Joseph and Hyrum and Porter were rowed swiftly across the river and on the far bank mounted horses and set out for thep291Rocky Mountains . They had provisions for a few days ; and after that expected to forage in any way they could . They had no map but Porter said he could find the way . Only once , while riding through the night , did Joseph speak . " In the morning , Ford 's posse will be hunting for us in Nauvoo . " " Yes , " said Porter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out west I 'll blow their brains out . " After riding until the first signs of dawn , the men fetched up at the house of a saint who had homesteaded in Iowa . Joseph said they would hide their horses and sleep here until evening ; but Porter said he needed no sleep . " I 'll keep watch . They 'll be on our trail . " He took a position behind a tree , his pistols ready , and watched the road down which they had come . Joseph awakened after a little while and came out with Hyrum and said he thought they had better be off ; and they mounted and rode again . They had not gone far when they heard the pounding of a horse behind them . Porter swung and raised his rifle but Joseph cried : " Do n't shoot ! It 's Reynolds Cahoon . " Cahoon came up at a gallop . He had been riding for hours in desperate chase , having used three mounts ; and now looked red-eyed from fatigue and loss of sleep . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you here for ? " " I have some messages , " said Cahoon , and dug into a saddlebag . " A pardon from the governor , I suppose ! " " Brother Joseph , " said Cahoon , " they want you to come back . " " Who ? " " The saints . Here 's a letter from Sister Emma . " Joseph opened it and the men watched him while he read . " She asks me to come back . She wants me to give myself up for trial . " " Do n't go , " said Porter . " You must , " said Cahoon . " The Governor has promised to protect you . " " Protect me ! " said Joseph bitterly . " The way I was protected in Mis-souri . " " You must come back . They all feel you 're a coward to run away . They say you 're sneaking off and leaving them without a leader . If you do n't come back , they will always say you were a coward . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ across the green landscape of Iowa . " Hyrum , what do you say ? " " I do n't know , Joseph , what to say . " " I say to hell with them ! " cried Porter . " It 's some of the judases who want you used up . " " Who are the ones who want me to return ? " " All of them , I guess . Brother Kimball , he called the meeting . " " Oh , he did ! " " I do n't trust him , " said Porter . " We 're off to the Rocky Mountains and we wo n't turn back for hell or high water . Tell them  --  " " No , Porter , wait a minute . You sure they want me back ? " " You'n see what the letters say . Even your wife " Emma never did care if I live or die . Do John Taylor and Orson Hyde and William Clayton want me to come ? " " I ca n't say how that is . I never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to say you are a coward if you run away . " " It 's the Judases , " said Porter . " They want you dead so they can rule . " Joseph gazed into the west . " Well , " he said at last , " if my life is of no value to my friends , it is of none to me . " " Do n't go ! " Porter cried . " Damn it to hell , you 'll be murdered . " " If that is what they want , then I 'll be murdered . My mind is made up . If they are calling me a coward , I 'll go back . " " Please do n't . Joe , let 's go on . " " No , Porter . We are going back . Come ! " On the long ride back , Joseph did not speak . He rode in advance of the others , silent with the bitterness of his thoughts ; reflecting , " If my life means nothing to them , it means nothing to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to protect me : that is stupidity or cunning and I 'll die without knowing which " ; and looking at the loveliness of this country in June and believing that he would never look upon it again . It was after dark when they came to the river . Quietly they rowed across it and quietly they entered the hushed city . To his companions he said : " I 'll send a message to the governor that I 'll go to Carthage in the morning . I 'll ask him to furnish a bodyguard . I 'll ask for a fair trial but I wo n't get it . I 'm a doomed man . " " If they touch a hair of your head , " said Porter , " I 'll spend the rest of my life using them up . You want me to take the message ? "  | " No , you stay with me . Fetch Brother Jedediah . " When Hyrum returned with Jedediah Grant , Joseph ask him to ride over to Carthage and tell Governor Ford he would surrender in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodyguard to protect me and a fair trial . " Jedediah 's long lean face was very grave . " I 'll tell him , " he said . After Jedediah had gone , Joseph turned to Porter . " I want to go off alone and pray . I 'm like Jesus in Gethsemane . " He went down to the broad dark river and knelt in prayer , and Porter stood close by with his hands on his pistols . Down the river a little way , Hyrum was also kneeling . The two brothers prayed a long while and Porter watched them or looked around him for prowling enemies . There were Missourians in Nauvoo , as well as leaders of waiting mobs ; but the darkened city seemed asleep . Nevertheless , Porter knew that spies were searching and he did not for a moment relax his vigilance . When Joseph rose from prayer and came to him , Porter saw that the prophet 's eyes were clouded with tears . " Hyrum and I will wait here . You fetch Jedediah when he returns . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll be safe . We 'll hide under the bank . " When Jedediah returned , his face was graver than before . " The governorwo n't promise anything .

" " No , Brother Porter . Governor Ford says he must come alone . " " The coward ! I 'll go with him . " " No , you must remain here . Am I the only one he wants ? " " He wants Hyrum too , and John Taylor and Willard Richards . " " Very well , Brother Jedediah . We 'll set out in the morning . " Joseph turned to Porter . " Hyrum and I want to be alone again . You keep watch . " Porter took a position where he could command all approaches , andJoseph and Hyrum went into a thicket by the river @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time he spent in prayer , asking God forwisdom to guide him and courage to meet his death ; for that it wasp294God 's will for him to die , and seal his ministry with his blood , he did not doubt . He did not ask for deliverance . He asked only for the strength to go without faltering and to die without complaint . And early in the next morning he set out with Hyrum and a few others for Carthage . Upon coming abreast of the temple , he paused . " Hyrum , we 've built a beautiful city and the saints are the best people in the world . Little do they know the troubles just ahead of them . " " They will all be murdered . " " No . After the mobs have our blood , they will leave most of the saints in peace . " " I doubt that , " John Taylor said . " It is so . It 's only the leaders they want . " " There can be no church without leaders . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " They rode on , but again and again Joseph turned on his horse to look back at the city , shining gloriously in the morning sun . Very few persons were astir . The saints did not know that their prophet was going forth to a town filled with his enemies . Smoke rose from a few chimneys , but Nauvoo was still asleep . " I 'll never see it again , " declared Joseph , looking back from a far hill . " We must n't be discouraged . God is with us . " " God was with Jesus , too , on the cross . " " Jesus was not taken , " said John Taylor , " until His work was finished . " " We never know when our work is finished . No , John , I 'm going like a lamb to the slaughter . This is true : my conscience is clear toward God and all men . I shall die innocent and it shall be said of me that 1 was murdered in cold blood . " " All of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Willard Richards was twitching with grief . " But why , Brother Joseph , do you feel we will be murdered ? " " I know it . All night I prayed . I knew it then . " " Why do n't we go back ? " " God has ordained it otherwise . " The men rode in silence . Four miles out of Carthage they were met by sixty soldiers ; and when Joseph saw them he rose in his stirrups . " Let us be unafraid . Let us die like brave men . " The soldiers rode up to meet them ; and without saying a word theyp295swung around in a cordon and marched in with their prisoners . Encampedin the public square of the town were the Carthage Grays , a company of militia , every man of whom , legend declared , had sworn to have the prophet 's life . They now laid hands on their guns and pressed forward as the prisoners rode past . " There he is ! " " Which one ? " " The tall one with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all right ! The God-damned Mormon ! " " Hey , Joe Smith , we got you now ! " " Yes , by God , and you wo n't get away this time ! " " Hey , Joe ! " cried a less vindictive Gray . " You got any nice little brunette in your bunch of concubines ? " " How many wives has he got ? " " The holy Christ knows ! About a thousand , I guess . " " Joe , you got a nice little brunette ? " " A thousand concubines ! We ought to fry the son-of-a-bitch in oil ! " " We 'll fry him , all right . He wo n't get away like he done in Missouri . " " Hey , how much do you want for a nice little brunette ? " As the prisoners were marched down the street to the Hamilton Hotel , the Carthage Grays followed , together with scores of angry and cursing men who had heard of Joseph 's coming . They raised such a blasphemous din that Governor Ford pushed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the matter with you men out here ? " " We want to see the prophet ! " " Damn it to hell , Governor , we want to see the son-of-a-bitch ! " " Silence ! " " To hell with you , Governor ! We want to see the man with all the concubines ! " " Listen to me a moment ! " " Shut your jib , you griddle-greasers ! Let 's hear what Tom Ford has to say . " " Gentlemen , I know how eager you are to see Mr. Smith . Tomorrow morning I 'll have him out on the public square and you can see him . Now behave yourselves . " " Is that a promise , Governor ? "  | " That 's a promise . You 'll see Mr. Smith tomorrow . " " Hurrah for Tom Ford ! " " If you break your promise we 'll come in and get him ! " " I tell you , " shouted the exasperated governor , " you will see him tomorrow ! Now act like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The crowd fell away , though many remained close by the hotel , hoping to see the prophet . Early the next morning , Tom Ford set out to fulfill his promise ; but when he marched Joseph and Hyrum , arm in arm , to the public square for the inspection of the curious , the Carthage Grays closed in , howling like demons . One of the officers drew his sword and yelled : " Listen to him ! He 's introducing the adulterous hoodlum as a general ! " Other officers drew their swords and cursed , and at once there was great confusion . Alarmed by their vehemence , Ford turned to argue with them . But an officer cried : " What do you mean by calling him a general ? " " That 's his title in Nauvoo . " " This is n't Nauvoo . " " He is lieutenant-general of the Nauvoo Legion . " " Nauvoo Legion ! He would n't even be a corporal in a decent army ! " " Listen , " said another , " are we going @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God ! Nobody can call him a general around real officers . " " I 've told you before , " said the exasperated governor , " that you willget full satisfaction . These men are to be tried for their lives . " " That does n't give you license to insult us by calling them generals ! " " General Deming , come here . " General Miner Deming came over . " These officers , " said Ford , " persistin insubordination . " " Sir , " a captain said , " we resent anyone who calls these hoodlums generals . " " Silence , Captain , or I 'll have you placed under arrest ! " " Men , " said the captain angrily , " will you let yourselves be arrested for so trifling an offense ? " " No ! " they roared . " By God , no ! " Deming flushed and turned to an aide . " Major Beems , place all these men under arrest . "  |p297Jose|ph  had overheard the altercation . If , he reflected , the governor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be in danger of their lives . But the governor was no such man . Flabbergasted by this turn of events , he hustled the men back to the hotel ; and a few moments later , a constable entered to arrest Joseph and Hyrum and take them to jail . " Sir , " said Joseph , stepping forward , " let me see your mittimus . You can not arrest me until I have had a hearing before a justice . " " Oh , I have a mittimus . " Gazing at Joseph with a sly smile , he dug into a pocket and fetched out a document . " There , " he said triumphantly , " read it . " Joseph took the paper . " This , " he said , " is a falsehood . It says I am arrested for treason but I have never appeared before a justice . " " I do n't know about that . The justice said to arrest you and that 's what I 'm here for . " " You ca n't arrest me until I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ witnesses ? Where is the evidence ? Call the justice over here . " The nonplussed constable looked around him . " I 'll have to see GovernorFord , " he said . Joseph went to a window and looked at the street . It was filled with angry men who were gazing up at the windows and cursing ; and even while Joseph stared at them , a dozen Carthage Grays entered his room . They said he was to be taken to jail , and they seized the arms of the prisoners and led them out . They led them up the street , with a howling mob following , and placed them in the debtors ' chamber , a large room with a bedstead and mattresses . When the door was closed , Joseph said : " We are doomed . " " If , " said Willard Richards , " it is only your death they want , let me die in your place . " " No , Willard . If I must die , then I must . " " Why ? " asked John @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ back with an army . We could get out of here and go west . " " No , it is too late for that . " " John , sing again . Sing the song about the poor wayfaring man of grief . " " No , Hyrum . I do n't feel like singing now . " John went to a window and looked out . Suddenly he cried , " Great God , see ! " The other prisoners ran to the window . A huge mob was coming , a  |p298howling  horde with blackened faces , with cudgels and knives and guns in their hands . They poured down the street in a great tide . A moment later , there was a sound of profaning men on the stairway outside the cell ; and remembering that there was no lock on the door , Joseph sprang to it and the other men followed . They hurled their combined weight to the door and fought with all their strength to keep it closed . Joseph had hidden a small pistol in his clothes . While shouldering against @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gun and cocked it . Under the pressure from without , the door shook on its hinges , and four men fought desperately against it with the strength of giants . A voice yelled : " Come out of there , you Mormon sons-of-bitches ! " For a moment there was silence . Then a man cried with an oath : " I 'll shoot them through the door ! " In the next instant a ball splintered a panel of the door and buried itself in the opposite wall . Joseph and John leapt to one side . Hyrum started across the room but had taken only two steps when a second bullet struck his nose . He spun and fell with a cry ; and as he fell , a third ball plowed through his flesh and lodged deep in his side . He struck the floor and turned convulsively . After a swift glance at his brother , Joseph sprang to the door and opened it far enough to thrust the muzzle of his pistol through . He fired blindly at the howling mob ; and while he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door and made a gaping wound in Hyrum 's throat . A half-dozen barrels were shoved through . These John wildly beat down with a club . The next few moments were nightmare for everyone but Joseph . John ran to a window to look out . A ball tore through one of his legs and turned him half-around , and a second bullet smashed his watch . As he fell , a third struck his thigh and blew off a piece of flesh as large as a man 's palm . Willard was insanely clubbing the musket barrels as they were shoved through . Suddenly , while John and Willard were fighting like wild men , Joseph felt deep peace . Like lightning the thoughts came to him that he had known , for many long years , that he must eventually seal his ministry with his blood ; that this was the end . He drew to his fullest height for a moment , no longer expecting to escape , no longer afraid . Then slowly he walked to the window . At the moment when he looked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around and left him reeling over the sill. " 0 Lord , my God ! " he said . His hands sought something to grasp and found nothing ; and in the next instant he pitched headlong to the street . Seeing him fall , a Carthage Gray ran up with fixed bayonet . With the point at Joseph 's throat , he leaned forward to look at the face . He stepped back . There was no need to drive with the bayonet . The prophet was dead.  |  --  N AN AUGUST MORNING IN THE YEAR OF 1844 , A YOUNG MAN OFtwenty-nine rode across the green hills of western Illinois . Powerfullybuilt but quick and light in moving , he looked like an adventurer seeking a new land as he turned right or left in his saddle to gaze around him . His forehead was broad and full under soft brown hair that curled over his ears and down his neck ; his mouth was wide and straight above a firm chin ; his eyes were coldly gray . He was a handsome but not a vain man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most men twice his age . His boyhood had been spent on a wild frontier : in almost every night he had heard the screams of panthers or the howling of wolves , and had become so accustomed to the sound and sight of danger that he made pursuit of it his pastime . To save a pet dog , he had thrown himself , knife in hand , upon a panther and plunged the dagger into the beast 's heart . Singlehanded he had gutted an enraged wild boar . He had grown up with danger always at the doorstep of his life . Death in some form had been for him almost a daily experience ; blood for him had been as common as water ; a desperate struggle to survive was the only law of life . Nevertheless , deadly encounters with man and beast on an American frontier had not made a monster of this man . When he was only sixteen he fell in love ; and his idolatrous worship of a girl three years older had softened him and led him to seek a gentler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ teeth and married her . A year later he entered the Methodist church . Under the influence of his wife , he devoted his next years to farming and to a study of theology ; and at last became acquainted with Mormon missionaries who journeyed back and forth over the road by which he lived . Persecution of the saints in Missouri again awakened the hunger nearest his heart ; and one night he slipped away to chastise in his own fashion three brutal rowdies , and then cast his lot with Joseph Smith.  |p304He  became a Mormon not because he was a mystic in need of a personalgod , or was troubled about his own soul : no , but because he liked to fight for the underdog and preferred an adventurous life to any other . He met Joseph and talked with him and liked the man . He did not understand the burning quest in the blue eyes or the eloquence of the lips ; but he believed in him and found him good . One day , hearing that mobs were on the march , he had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ If you ever need me , call me , " he said . " I 'm not a bad hand with a gun . " Joseph never called him , and the bold young man who offered his services lived in the ways of peace . He heard of the Danites , those avengingbands among the saints , and was eager to join them , but his wife persuaded him to remain on the farm . He loved his wife and children , but again and again he stared at the useless guns that hung on the walls of his home . He did not like peace . He did not like the monotonous routine of a homestead and all its deadly chores . For most men , the earth was something to be tilled , but for him it was a vast empire in which adventure waited on every hilltop , at every turn in the road , in every grog shop and tavern from coast to coast . He hungered to use his guns ; and more frequently as the dull years passed he took them down from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had an enemy to shoot at . " You are n't happy with me , " his wife would say . " Oh , yes , I am . " But he would sigh like a most unhappy fellow . " 1 do n't have much to do around here . " Thinking of the road and the open spaces , he added : " I hear there 's trouble up in Nauvoo . I reckon they might need me there . " " But we need you here . " " I could run up and look around me . If the prophet needs me , then I could send for you . " But he did not go then . He cut cordwood for the coming winter , plowed his fields and planted his crops . When , two months later , he heard that Joseph had been murdered , he was too stunned to speak . He went into a forest , wondering persistently , vainly what he could do to avenge that death . Very gravely he returned to the house and stood before his pistols and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cleaned and loaded them . He handled them as if they were very precious .  |p305After  a few minutes he polished the blade of his hunting knife until it had the brightness of a mirror . " Where you going ? " his wife asked . " To Nauvoo . " " What for ? " Without looking at her he said quietly : " The prophet has been killed . " " Joseph ! You mean him ? " " Yes , and Hyrum too . And John Taylor was almost killed . " " What are you going to do now ? " Again he said quietly : " I 'm off for Nauvoo . " " To get yourself killed too , I guess . " He looked at her and smiled . " There 's nobody quick enough with a gun to kill me . I 'll be all right . " He rose and stretched his arms , feeling the young and vigorous strength of his body . He buckled the knife and pistols to his waist . Then he went out and saddled his favorite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up to the door . " I 'll send for you , " he said . " The church needs me now . " In the evening of the sixth day he paused on a hilltop to gaze at a city shining in the sun . He had never seen it before . He had heard that Joseph turned a swamp into the largest city in Illinois , but he had not known that Nauvoo was such a beautiful place . It had wide clean streets and many fine buildings ; and on a hill in the distance stood a great temple . For several minutes he gazed across the tops of buildings and trees or at the broad river or across the river at the city of Montrose  --  remembering how Joseph had escaped from a dungeon and fled to this unwanted swamp to build upon it the most magnificent city in the state . And for that he had been murdered . Who , he wondered , would be the leader now ? Many would strive for leadership , including Sidney Rigdon , Lyman Wight , Emma , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would fall to Brigham Young . It would be a pleasure to serve so brave and resourceful a man . He had watched Brigham gather the scattered and terrified saints five years ago and lead them over frozen prairie to the river and to a new home . He had offered his services to Brigham , but Brigham had not wanted avengers then . He wanted peace . " The best way to handle an enemy , " he had said , " is to put yourself a thousand miles away from him . " There were other ways too , the man on the hilltop reflected , especiallyp306when the enemies were bandits and brigands who burned and raped and murdered . If the saints were to build God 's kingdom on earth , there was no reason , as Lyman Wight had often declared , to allow scoundrels out of hell to stand in the way . A man could move a thousand miles from them but they would follow . They could be taught , not with sermons and precepts from the Bible , but with a blow in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the way this man saw the matter as he sat on his horse and watched the sun sink in golden splendor behind the purple reefs beyond Montrose . He hoped Brigham Young would no longer turn the other cheek . For another half-hour he sat and pondered ; and then , armed and ready , young Bill Hickman rode into Nauvoo.  | BRIGHAM ARRIVED THE NEXT DAY . HE WAS IN NEW ENGLAND WHEN HE D ) learned that Joseph had been murdered , and for hours he was too overwhelmed to think clearly or to wonder who the new leader would be . When at last this great question entered his mind , he hastened westwardat all possible speed ; but the news had traveled so slowly and his return journey consumed so much time that he did not arrive in Nauvoo until nearly six weeks after the prophet 's death . He found a strangely silent world in Illinois , and the Hancock Prairie as hushed as a tomb . Hyrum had been slain with his brother , and a month later , Samuel had died from a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Carthage and Warsaw were deserted by terrified gentiles who expected the Nauvoo Legion to march in with sword and fire . So many of the saints in Nauvoo were in hiding that it too looked to Brigham like an abandonedcity . After finding and talking with a few leaders whom he trusted , Brighamrealized that he had not arrived a moment too soon . Sidney Rigdon for two years had been sulking in Pittsburgh ; but upon learning of Joseph 's death he had gone pell-mell to Nauvoo and with impassioned oratory had been pleading his own cause . He had enlisted a large and enthusiastic following . " He 's called a public meeting for day after tomorrow , " said Brigham 's old friend , Heber Kimball . " He expects to become president and prophet . " " Does he ? " asked Brigham , wishing Rigdon had perished in the Missouri dungeon . " Well , between you and me , Heber , I intend to lead the church myself . " " You 're the man for it . " " That 's what I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't tell Rigdon . Are there any more around here plotting to be the prophet ? " " Any more ! At least a dozen , Brigham . " " Who are they ? " " Jim Strang " That long-haired lunatic ! " "  --  and Lyman Wight and Emma . Emma says her older son is to be the leader when he grows up . Sister Lucy says that now Joseph and Hyrum and Samuel are dead , William is to be the leader . " " I 'll see Emma first . You help me get the lay of the land . You 're to be my chief counselor . " Brigham found Emma in the gloomy Nauvoo House , sole queen of it now and ready for battle . As soon as she saw Brigham , her thin lips tightened and her black eyes shone like jewels . " What do you want ? " " Sister Emma , we have to choose a leader . I came to see you " We do not . When my son Joseph grows up , he 'll be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was to be . " " No , Sister . Joseph said Hyrum was to succeed him , but Hyrum is dead . " " And my son is to be the new prophet . " " No , " said Brigham , a little impatiently . " We must have a man to lead us , not a child . " " My son is the new prophet . Remember that , and do n't try any foxy tricks . " " We 'll have to all talk it over . I 'll see the other members of the Twelve . " Brigham did not intend to be a fox . He intended to be a lion , but first he would be very sure of his ground . The other pretenders had to be taken care of . The shaggy half-crazed Jim Strang was already calling himself prophet and president , and offering a forged letter to prove it . The letter , purporting to be from Joseph , declared that Strang was to be the leader ; that the saints were to move to Voree in Wisconsin ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ James J. Strang . Furthermore , Strang said , an angel had appeared to him and thundered : " James J. Strang , thou art to be prophet of the church and successor to Joseph Smith ! " Among Strang 's supporters were William , Joseph 's violent and blasphemous brother , as well as the crafty John Bennett whom the prophet had thrown out of the church . Brigham decided to see Strang next . " Brother Jim , I understand Joseph wrote you a letter . " " He did , " said Jim , looking at Brigham with insane eyes.  | " Let me see it . " " To hell with you . I 'm the president now . " " But I , " said Brigham gently , " am president of the twelve apostles . " " Joseph told you apostles to obey me . If you don't --  " Shut up that nonsense , Jim . We wo n't obey you at all . " " Then , " said Jim , wagging his wild dark head , " I 'll excommunicate you . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair that hung across Jim 's shoulders . " Listen , Jim , I do n't want to see you send your soul to hell . You take my advice and shut up before someone shuts you up . " God damn ! " roared Jim , exasperated . " I 'm president and prophet , I tell you ! And I 'm going to be king ! " " No , Jim , you 're going to run right bang into a lot of trouble . " " What do you mean ? " " I 'm president of the Twelve . I 'm leader until a leader is chosen . " " Oh , no , you 're not , " said Jim , grinning cunningly as if to say , " I 've found you out now ! " Brigham tapped the man again . " Brother James , I want you to save your soul and live to a ripe old age . And you will if you do n't cause too much trouble . " Brigham turned away from the long-maned fellow with his delusions of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ go off somewhere to fancy himself a king ; or he would stay here and kick up so much strife that Porter or another would teach him a lesson . He was not dangerous , but Lyman Wight was . That hotheaded man had never given fealty to or obeyed anyone except Joseph ; and now that the prophet was dead , Lyman was following his violent whims . He was enlisting saints in a company which he intended to lead to Wisconsin . Brigham did not wish to talk with him . He was not afraid of Lyman  --  he was not afraid of any man ; but he did not want to argue with one who was all hot temper and curses . " We wo n't pay any attention to Lyman Wight , " he said to Heber . " He 'll lead a bunch into the wilderness and they 'll come crawling back or stay there to feed the wolves . But there 's something else that worries me . " " Sister Emma ? "   " No . I 'll take care of Emma . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There 's a man named Bickerton in Pennsylvania who says he 's prophet and revelator now . And there 's jim Brewster . You remember back in Kirtland when he was a plain damn fool kid . Now he 's a prophet . There 's a fellow named Hedrick . He 's a prophet too and has appointed a whole batch of apostles . Dave Whitmer says he 's the prophet now . By the God of Israel , Heber , prophets are thicker around here than babies . " " We can excommunicate them . " " Yes , but every one would take a bunch of followers . We 'd be left here with our wives . " " Maybe not all our wives , " said Heber , grinning . " There 's a lot of talk . No matter how hard we try to keep it a secret , celestial marriage is leakingout . One of my wives told her best friend and she told her best friend who also had a best friend who had a best friend ; and so it goes . When all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we do ? " " Ca n't you shut your wives up ? " " Brigham , God Almighty Himself could n't shut some women up . They just have to talk . " " I know . That 's one of our problems . But we must keep celestial marriage a secret for a long while yet . Did you know Rigdon has half the saints believing in him ? For a red cent I 'd have Porter Rockwell send him in a canoe down the river . " " Just give him enough rope and he 'll hang himself . " Brigham 's smile was faint . " And hang a lot of us with him . Well , I 'll see him tomorrow and damned if I wo n't have plenty to say , too . " " The whole thing will depend on what you say . " " I know it . If God is with me  --  Heber , you 'd better pray for me tonight . " Sidney Rigdon had plenty to say . He stood in a wagon and talked across a park @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a half , his great voice rolled in thunder over his rhetoric . Thousands of saints had gathered to hear him , remembering in former addresses the man 's timing , his dramatic change of tone , his wild histrionic gestures . After an hour of impassioned harangue , Rigdon began to act a little strangely : not one of those who heard him guessed that he had seen Brigham far back in the throng . Rigdon 's voice began to shake . His whole bodyp311shook when he declared that back in Pittsburgh , God had appeared and commanded him to hasten to Nauvoo and offer himself as guardian of the people . For many years , he said , he had been Joseph 's chief counselor ; he had fought at his side in New York , in Ohio , and he had sat by him in dungeons in Missouri . He had more intimate knowledge of Joseph 's mind and purpose than any other man alive . Suddenly his voice was petulantly shrill . " God commanded me to come here and offer myself as your guardian ! I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to do ! You can please yourselves whether you accept me or not ! " That cry of doubt was a strange anticlimax to what the multitude had expected . For a few moments there was utter silence . Then a man cheered and others echoed him ; but when it looked as if the thousands would acclaim Rigdon as leader , a great voice bellowed across the multitude . Ten thousand persons turned in amazement , for they had not known that Brigham was in Nauvoo . The effect of his sudden appearanceand the sound of his booming voice were overwhelming . A woman shouted hysterically that the voice was the voice of Joseph . A man climbed to an eminence and roared : " Lo , the mantle of Elijah is falling upon Elisha ! " " Silence ! " Brigham thundered . And there was silence as he made his way through the multitude to the wagon where the abashed Rigdon stood . Rigdon , indeed , stepped down when he saw Brigham coming , and backed away as if in terror . Without looking at him , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ people . " I do not care , " he cried , " who leads this church , but one thing I must know , and that is what God says about it ! I have the keys and the means of obtaining the mind of God on the subject ! Joseph conferred upon our heads all the keys and powers belonging to the apostleship which he himself held before he was taken away , and no man or set of men can get between Joseph and the Twelve in this world or in the world to come ! " He paused . There was not a sound anywhere . Knowing that his next words would make or break him , Brigham waited for several moments and gazed down at the thousands of faces . His voice was gentler when he spoke again .   " You can not fill the office of prophet , seer and revelator : God must do this . You are like children without a father and sheep without a shepherd . You must not appoint any man at our head : if you do , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a man at our head , but if you do want any other man or men to lead you , take them and we will go our way to build up the kingdom in all the world . " Again he paused . There was not a person among the thousands who was not gazing at him earnestly and waiting for his next words . The next words , sudden and impassioned and final , came like thunder . " I will tell you who your leaders or guardians will be ! The Twelve  --  I at their head ! " There was no applause . There was not even a lone shout of approval or disapproval . Brigham waited . He wanted the multitude to look at him and feel in him , not a prophet , but the energetic and resourceful man who led them out of Missouri , and who could now gather them from their enemies and build them into an empire . He stepped down from the wagon and stood on the tongue . " Brothers and Sisters , we will put it to a vote @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not . All in favor of the Twelve , raise their hands ! " There was a sea of ten thousand hands . " All those opposed ? " Brigham had won . The saints roared with joy and pressed around him ; and when , a little later , he pushed his way through and turned toward his home , thousands of singing persons followed him up the street . But he was too shrewd a judge of the human heart to believe , as Joseph had believed too many times , that a cheering multitude would cheer long . His fight was still ahead of him . He had inherited a leaderlessand demoralized people , split into a dozen factions : to integrate these factions or to drive them out was his first task . In this he would be , as he would be in all necessary ways , a ruthless and , if possible , an invincible leader . There would be iron in his hand . He had also inherited , he reflected , while going toward Nauvoo House , a hundred vengeful mobs that were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Fools within the church he could handle ; bandits were another matter . His strategy would be to maneuver andP313plot rather than to force ( as Joseph had wished to ) an open battle . To deal with mob leaders at their own level , he needed bold and loyal men  --  men who would use up the cowardly rascals and then keep their own mouths shut . He was sitting in Joseph 's study and thinking of his enemies , both in and out of the church , when a man entered who looked like a buccaneerfrom far places . Quick to size men up , Brigham observed the stranger 's studded belt , his pistols , his knife . " Hello , Brother Brigham Young . " " Hello , " said Brigham , wondering where he had seen this man . " I heard you talk a little while ago . " The stranger advanced and offered a powerful hand . " I 'm Bill Hickman . " " Oh , yes . I 've met you before . " Brigham was interested . Gray eyes met @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ future . Then Brigham said : " Are you one of the saints ? " " Well , I do n't feel very saintly but I 've been a Mormon ever since I decided I would n't be a Methodist . " Again Brigham studied the man . " Why have you come to me ? " " Because , " said Bill , going straight to the point , " I think you need me . As I figger it , you 've got a tough job on your hands . " " How , " asked Brigham cautiously , " do you think you can help ? " Bill 's lips smiled under his handsome whiskers . " Well , this is how I see it . You 've got a lot of enemies . Here in Nauvoo every third man on the street is your enemy . The prophet Joseph , they drove him out of New York and Ohio and Missouri , and then they murdered him . I think mebbe God might like a little vengeance for that murder . " Bill paused , his gaze @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigham said . " When you talked out there , I had my hands on my old smoke-poles . I figgered someone in that crowd would try to use you up . The way I see it , some men can be reasoned with and some have to be put out of sight . I guess the Lord wo n't mind if some of the sinners is found fast asleep . That 's how I see it . " He paused and waited but Brigham did not speak . " Or am I full of counterfeit talk ? " asked Bill . " Go ahead . I want to know how you see things . " " That 's how . You have to build up the kingdom . God has commandedyou to , hai n't He ? But you ca n't do it as long as you let masons andP314pukes and pot-soppers murder our prophets . Now me , I 'm a peaceable man . I do n't reckon to harm no one who obeys the Lord and lets us alone . But neither do I figger to let any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ head . " That was forthright . That was within the understanding and intentionof Brigham 's mind and heart . He believed he could trust this man . " Did you belong to the Danites down in Missouri ? " " All that , " said Bill cannily , " was a long time ago . It would surprise me if I could remember . " " Brother Bill , are you afraid of anything ? " " Not that I ever set eyes on . I ai n't never run yet , and dog on it , I 'm too plumb old to begin now . " " Bill , I can use you but let me tell you something . I 'm not afraid either but you ca n't fight the back of a porcupine with bare hands . I have a job to do . I am going to build the Lord 's kingdom and I do n't intend to let anything stop me . Nothing , " said Brigham , looking at Bill . " I understand you , " Bill said . " I need men @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find out what the mobs are planning to do . Every day , I want to know what 's going on . I want to know who my friends are and who my enemies are . Will that job suit you ? " " It fits me like my own skin . " " All right . But do n't sock away any good men . Before you decide to sock any man away , tell me who he is and what sin he is guilty of . Then if he needs an operation just below the chin , I 'll see about it . Those are orders . " " Yes , " said Bill agreeably . " I always obey orders . " Brigham looked at him thoughtfully . " You married ? " " I been married twelve years . " " God revealed to the prophet Joseph a new principle . It 's called celestial marriage . The leaders have the privilege of more than one wife so they can have more offspring to help them become gods in the next world . It 's a secret @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ talk about it , " said Bill . " I know that . But it has to be a secret for a while . If anyone asks you if the leaders have more than one wife , say no . We have to lie about itP315until the time comes to make it known to the world . Would you like another wife ? " " God , I ai n't thought about that . One has been about all I could manage . " " If you ever want another wife , tell me . Nobody can take more than one wife without my permission . " " I 'll think about it , " Bill said . Brigham grasped the powerful hand again . " Now get on your job . Report to me daily . " " Fine and dandy . I will . " " And use your brains . If you get me and the church in trouble " I wo n't . That 's part of my job . " " All right , find out what the damned gentiles are doing . " After Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The Lord 's kingdom had to be established throughout the world , and the Lord 's enemies had to be converted  --  or rebuked . It was a big job . He reached for his tall hat and looked at himself in a mirror . It was about time , he remembered now , for him to take another wife . He had only five . Joseph when he died had twenty-seven  --  or more , because nobody quite knew how many there were . After Brigham 's first wife had died in Kirtland , he had married Mary Ann Angel ; and not until June , two years ago , had he taken a celestial wife . She was Lucy Ann Decker . A year ago he had wedded two women on the same day : Harriet Cook , a maid of nineteen , and Augusta Evans , a spinster of forty-one . Since then he had married Lucy 's sister Clara . While gazing at his strong handsome face , he thought of Clarissa Ross  --  as well as of wives whom Joseph had left . Emily Partridge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drop around and see her for a moment , and give her a word of cheer . P316RIGHAM DID NOT HAVE JOSEPH 'S SENSUOUS DELIGHT IN FAIR WOMEN . Polygamy for him was not now and was never to be a matter of carnal hunger : it was a commandment from God , and a great advantage in the world to come . For the most part , Joseph had taken young and attractive women ; Brigham was content to mate with those of childbearingage , even though they might be among the homeliest and most unloved of the saints . For he was not a lover . He did not woo his wives with soft caress and whispered endearment , or try to make of sexual embrace more than a simple physical union . His approach was unromantic ; his mating was brief . He was not interested in women except as wives and mothers of men . He was interested in building the Lord 's kingdom , and in fulfilling the commandments which God had given to Joseph . His call on Emily was , therefore , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . After that , he was off to his work , his mind busy with plans , his imaginationshaping the architecture of his dream . Whether he would have to abandon this beautiful city , he did not know : it would depend on what the gentiles did . Perhaps they would be satisfied , now that they had murdered the prophet and two of his brothers . He sent other scouts into the unfriendly areas , read the newspapers , watched and waited . Day by day he realized more clearly how enormous his task was . Among the newspaper editorials which he read , one declared him to be a counterfeiter , and all his followers chronic thieves ; a second cried , " Every saint , mongrel or whole-blood , and everything that looks like a saint or talks and acts like a saint , should be compelled to leave ! " ; and a third editor wrote : " The Nauvoo charter has been repealed . We must now drive the brigands out of Illinois and scatter the adulterous whoremastersover the face of the earth . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and confused ! " After reading a score of such violent denunciations , Brigham told the young men and even the boys in Nauvoo to wear bowie knives . " If a P317stranger comes to this city , follow him and whittle on a stick or a shingle and whistle . " " Shall we tickle him with a knife ? " " Do n't touch him . Just whittle and whistle . That ought to put ice in his blood . " Thereafter , when Brigham walked the streets , he saw anxious and harassed spies followed by a crowd of whittling and whistling men . If the stranger entered a tavern , the group entered also , and sat or stood around him , solemnly busy with their sharp knives , and whistling a doleful and tuneless ditty that was chilling . When the stranger went again to the street , the gang followed him . He was trailed remorselessly until he fled . One afternoon a flabbergasted legislator burst into Brigham 's office . He was covered with sweat . " What kind of lawless city do you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me everywhere ! " Brigham 's face was grave . " Ai n't you one of the legislators who repealed our charter ? " " Why , yes , I voted " That 's the trouble . We used to have laws but you took them away . I ca n't protect you . " Brigham 's faint smile was sardonic . He was remembering the answer that President Van Buren gave to Joseph . He said : " Your cause is just but I can do nothing for you . " " I tell you my life is in danger ! No matter where I go , these whistling stick-whittlers follow me . What 's the meaning of it ? " " My life , " said Brigham , " is in danger too . If I go out of the city , I see armed mobs . We came here from Missouri and built a beautiful city on what was a swamp . The man who built this city was murdered by men who helped elect you to office . You 've repealed our charters . Your trial of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cowardly governor will give us no protection . So we whittle and whistle to pass the time away . " Brigham rose and bowed and opened the door . " I 'm sorry , " he said , " that I can do nothing for you . " As the man turned to go , Brigham 's eyes twinkled . " Perhaps , " he suggested softly , " your life will be safer elsewhere . " He sank to his desk and chuckled . His simple plan of whittling and whistling was certainly curdling the blood of his enemies . P318A man entered . Jedediah Grant , destined for high position in the church , was only twenty-eight in this year , but he had become one of Brigham 's most trusted lieutenants . Humorless , hot-tempered , he was the most fanatically zealous of all the leaders . Under a high forehead , he had pale cold eyes that were too close together ; a long thin blade of a nose that covered more than half the length of his face from his brows to the point of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is it , Brother Jedediah ? " " Sidney Rigdon is going to talk in the Park to his followers . " " I ' 11 be there . " As Brigham strolled down the street , he wondered what to do with this stupendous fool . He did not like to throw him out  --  for Rigdon would take several hundred deluded persons with him . If Brigham were to cast every foolish prophet out , the ranks would be decimated by almost a third . Nevertheless , his patience was nearly exhausted  --  and it was completely exhausted after he listened to Rigdon 's furious oratory . " God , " Rigdon howled at several hundred persons , " has given me a vision , and commanded me to lead the saints to Pittsburgh , the new promised land ! The Almighty has promised me that I 'll be the most powerful man on earth ! I 'll be so powerful that I 'll cross the Atlantic , encounter the Queen 's forces , and overcome them  --  and plant the American standard on English ground and then march @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of her riches and dominions ; which if she refuse , I will take the little madam by the nose , and lead her out , and she shall have no power to help herself ! If I do not do this , the Lord never spake by mortal ! ... " Brigham groaned and turned away . The man was mad : that was the most charitable thing to be said of him . Of all his principal followers , Rigdon had made , not priests and bishops but kings ; for in the kingdom of Sidney Rigdon , nobody was to be less than a duke or an earl ; and Sidney himself was to be a potentate whose rule would be absolute . When evening came , Brigham decided to go to Rigdon and try to argue with him . " Brother Sidney - " " I am President Rigdon ! " " Brother Sidney , I came to reason with you . " Brigham looked at thep319man 's eyes and knew there was no reason in him . " I do n't like to throw you out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you continue your damned foolishness , , " Listen , " said Rigdon , his eyes glittering under great shaggy brows , " if you persist in your usurpation , I 'll tell the whole world about your wickedness , your abominable acts , your studhorse adulteries , your secret lecherous carnivals , your murderous Danites , , " Hold your tongue ! " " You 're not fit to live ! You 're an abomination ! You and all your followers are a gang of thieves and adulterers and whoremasters ! " Brigham flushed with rage . " Sidney , I 'll ask the Twelve to excommunicateyou tomorrow . So fall down , like Judas , and let your bowels burst out , and let the world see how much filth you had in you . Joseph once said he threw you off and we put you back on his shoulders . This time you 're going out for good . " " You corrupt adulterer ! You abominable apostate ! You , , But Brigham had left the house . The next day , the Twelve excommunicated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ prophet left for Pittsburgh , taking with him his loyal followers , of whom sixteen were kings , eleven were princes , and seven were dukes . With pleasure Brigham watched them go , reflecting that every last one of them would end in bedlam or in hell . He was sorry to see so many souls headed for Satan ; and he wondered if it would not have been more merciful to have killed them before they were possessed by devils . It was better to die and go to heaven than to live a long life and go to hell . That was a matter which he had pondered before . When in Missouri he saw apostates throwing their immortal souls away , he had said to Heber : " Sometimes I think it would be best to kill them while they car . be saved . It 's damned bad to let them give their souls to Satan . " This theological point he had no time to settle now . His enemies , encouraged by violent newspaper editorials , were coming out of hiding and taking matters @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bandits had just burned one hundred and seventy-five houses , and driven the saints like stampededcattle into Nauvoo . As Brigham watched them pour in , some P320old and half-naked , some bloody from wounds , and others insane from grief and loss , he swore a great oath and sent for Bill Hickman . " Bill , what 's going on out there ? " " Murder , by God . If you stay in Nauvoo , the city will be sacked and burned . I heard the name of one of the gang leaders who killed Joseph and Hyrum . I went to his house over in Green Plains and asked for a night 's lodging and told him I was from Missouri . So he kicked the wind in its face and told me the whole story . He says if the Mormons ai n't chased out soon , they 'll control Illinois just like they about controlled Missouri . " Bill paused and considered . " I figgered I 'd catch the old sonof-a-bitchalone and use him up . But you said to ask you first so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anybody . That would give the mobs an excuse . " " Well , " said Bill , remembering , " I scouted everywhere . I seen severalmen who was in the black-face mob that murdered Joseph . I talked with them . They boast about it and how everyone was acquitted at the trial . " " Let them boast . Bill , do you think we should go west ? " " Well , the longer we stay here , the more trouble we 'll have . What happened in Linn , it will happen everywhere . " " I guess we 'll have to go west if we'n sell our property . All right , you move around and keep your eyes open . " Bill fingered a pistol . " If I run into any of them-there pukes who killed Joseph , you want me to sock them away ? " " No . I want no trouble . " Suddenly Brigham smiled . " Governor Ford does n't like our immoral practices because they differ from his own . " Bill grinned for a moment and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him out alone " For the last time I say no . Keep your guns in their holsters . Porter Rockwell gives me enough trouble . I hear he just killed a man over in Carthage . " " In self-defense , " said Bill , but his grin was sly . " It 's ears and eyes and brains I want , not pistols . " " Just like you say . You 're the general . " When Bill left , Brigham went to find his friend Heber . He told Heber the saints were whipped here . " I know that , " Heber said . " If we stay much longer , we 'll be fleeing P321in our endowment garments . The sooner we go , the more property we can sell . " " You 're right . Well , Heber , I 'm taking the bull by the horns and spitting in both his eyes . We 're going . " " Where ? " " To some valley outside of the United States . Lewis and Clark and Fremont have mapped several good places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just as soon as I can , I 'll send the apostles across the river with two or three thousand . That will hold the mobs off until we can sell and get ready . If they see we mean to move , mebbe they 'll stop burning and murdering us . " " But where , " asked Heber again , " are we going to ? " " Anywhere , Heber , just so we get out of the United States . We 'll go to a desert . " " A desert ! " " If we have a desert , " said Brigham wisely , " then the saints will have to work . And besides , nobody else will want to come there . " " We want a place so bad nobody else will ever want it . Not even the United States . " " We 'll find one . " Brigham slapped Heber on his back . " Do n't look so solemn ! Only the Almighty God of Israel can whip us . " Brigham moved at once with all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ; and one by one the other towns and hamlets were emptied as thousands poured in afoot , on horse , in wagons , bringing their household goods and cattle , and settling on the outskirts of Nauvoo in shacks or tents or in nothing at all . Word went forth by a hundred riders that the saints were to gather and prepare for a great migration . To those who asked why he was going west , Brigham always gave the same answer : " To get away from Christians and out of the United States ! " He would go to some western desert and build the Lord 's kingdom . He would have to cross fifteen hundred miles of wilderness , inhabited by Indians and wild beasts ; cross a vast country almost without roads and trails ; enter deserts upon which there would be little water or none at all ; and ford mighty rivers that were unmapped and unbridged . He would have to fight hardship , starvation , disease . No other man here , perhaps no other man anywhere , would have dared to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he laid an iron hand upon the energy of his people . Every home in Nauvoo was turned into a workshop . Laboring far into the nights , women knitted and sewed , fashioning warm and durable garments for a long journey . Men built wagons of all kinds , made harness for both horse and ox , coverings against wind and storm , compartmentsfor food , barrels and casks for water . Labor was a mighty sound through the length and breadth of the city , and no hand was idle . All day , and sometimes all night , Brigham went from shop to shop , from group to group , cheering , advising , commanding . " That wagon ai n't strong enough . Build you another . " Again : " You do n't want all that junk . You do n't need it and your oxen ca n't pull it . Throw it away . " And again : " Trade that ox off or shoot him . He ca n't stand the trip . And put a stronger axle in that wagon or you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stern advice to the sisters too . " What you making all that damned folderol for ? You ai n't going to a ball , Sister . You 're going through a wilderness of Indians and wolves . " He did much more than to advise or rebuke the thousands who toiled . Because he wanted all the saints to get out of the United States , he told Parley to instruct those in eastern states to embark by boat . He made an inventory of all the belongings , tried to sell the property of the church , and drove troublemakers out of Nauvoo . Haste was necessary now . Angry committees all over Illinois were clamoring for immediate expulsionof the Mormons , and the bold sheriff of Hancock County was working earnestly to keep peace . Matters came to a crisis when a furious committee in Quincy , declaring they represented sixty thousand gentiles , demanded that the saints leave the state at once . " The hellhounds ! " Brigham roared . " They wo n't even give us time to make wagons and sell our stuff ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who acted as his secretary and scribe . " Take an answer to that gang of Quincy hoodlums . Draw it up ; say it 's our desire to live in peace and to get out , but we want to take our old and sick with us , and sell our property . " The statement was sent and Brigham waited for a reply . He was enraged when the committee flatly rejected his proposition and returned word that the Mormons must leave at once . Brigham considered the matter and sent another message . He said at least a thousand families P323would leave Illinois immediately ; and added that the saints had hundreds of farms , thousands of homes , as well as a temple and business establishments for sale . He asked for time to dispose of all these . Then he sent a letter to the President , and a letter to every governor except in Illinois and Missouri , inquiring in the name of God if there was in the United States anywhere an asylum for a persecuted people . " Exert your influence , " he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religious rights where we are now , or in some part of the United States , or at some place remote therefrom where we may colonize in peace . " To this appeal he received only one answer . Governor Tom Drew of Arkansas wrote a thoughtful reply ; but after pointing out that Arkansas would not undertakewhat Missouri and Illinois had rejected , he concluded : " Should the Latter-day Saints migrate to Oregon they will carry with them the goodwillof philanthropists and the blessings of every friend of humanity . If they are wrong , their wrongs will be abated with many degrees of allowance ; and if right , migration will afford an opportunity to make it manifest in due season to the whole civilized world . " Brigham now realized that he would have to lead his people westward . He again went from group to group , urging them to greater effort , when he was accosted by John Taylor . " Brigham , did you know there are warrants out for the arrest of you and me ? " Brigham had been examining a pile @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Israel 's God , " he thundered , " we wo n't submit ! We wo n't be dragged off and murdered like Joseph and Hyrum ! They can all go to hell first ! " " But what shall we do ? " " We 'll fight ! John , " he said , " you sleep too much . Help speed things up here . Four hours of sleep is enough for a while . " Winter was coming . The river was beginning to freeze , but Brigham knew that he and his people must leave Illinois soon or blood would run like water in every street in Nauvoo . He offered the temple for sale . He pushed at top speed the selling of land and homes . He appointed a leader to each unit of fifty persons , and told them to drive the workers to the last ounce of their strength . Preparations for the great migration went ahead at a sleepless pace ; clothing and equipment grew into huge piles . One afternoon while Brigham was talking in his office with John Taylor , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @   " I have been sent by the governor , " he said sternly . " There are warrants for the arrest of you two . How long do you intend to resist the majesty of the law ? " Brigham sank to a chair , overcome by the irony of the question . John lost his temper . " You talk , sir , about the majesty of the law ! Why , the law to us is mere farce ! Majesty of the law ! Where are the murderers of Joseph and Hyrum Smith ? Have they been punished ? No , sir , and you know they have n't . They 're out now , burning our homes and killing our beasts , and you either wo n't or ca n't stop them ! " " Just a minute  --  " the major began , but Taylor swung to him in greater fury . " Are we to sit still while marauders and house-burners come in and give us the hot iron ? I tell you plainly , sir , I will not ! " " If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' seventy-six ? If a man were not hardened and desperate , he would be ashamed to oppress a people already goaded beyond endurance ! Talk about law ! Sir , I stand before you , a victim of law ! I have seen my best friends shot down ! Was I not shot down too in the Carthage jail when two hundred murderers came upon us ? Where is our governor , where are our generals , our judges ? What are all these men but a pack of scoundrels ? Are we beasts ? I tell you , sir , hereafter I will protect myself , law or no law , judges or no judges , governor or no governor ! I will not be murdered by scoundrels ; and if I have to sell my life , I 'll sell it for all I can ! If you put me in jail , you will put me there dead ! " " If you would listen , " said the major , somewhat abashed . " We listened , " said Brigham . " When Joseph and Hyrum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair trial . The governor was in Carthage with troops at his command when these men were butchered . If we submit to arrest , it will be the same old story . " Brigham came around his desk . " Major , we will not submit . " " What , then , do you propose to do ? " " Leave Illinois as soon as we can . But we wo n't leave naked and without food in wintertime to journey fifteen hundred miles . That would be death . If we must die , we 'll die here . "   " I 'm afraid , Mr. Young , that if you do not submit to arrest , the mobs will move in in spite of all I can do . " " Then we 'll defend ourselves . " " Besides , the governor has lost patience . You promised months ago to leave  --  " " But not to leave naked and hungry . We 'll leave next spring . " " If you wait until next spring " Very well , sir . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once . Tell the governor that . " " I 'll tell his Excellency but I can give you no assurance of what he will do . " " Tell him we 're getting out as fast as we can . Tell him if he sends troops in here or lets the mobs come , we 'll fight clear down to our boots and wade in blood to our necks . " " Do you mean that ? " " Major , do you doubt it ? " " No , " said the major , looking at Brigham 's eyes . Knowing that neither the law nor the mobs would wait until he could move his people safely , Brigham ordered a thousand families to cross the Mississippi River . It was midwinter . The great stream was frozen over . The thousands crossed on the ice , herding their beasts with them , dragging a few household goods after them . It was a spectacle that made even Brigham pause to gaze at the straggling and desperate multitude . The weather was bitter cold , the mile of ice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day long , persons and beasts slipped and skidded and fell on their way to the far bank . Brigham took command and moved with them ; and when he reached the far shore , he turned to gaze at Nauvoo and to speak to the multitude . " Our homes , gardens , orchards , farms , streets , bridges , mills , public halls , temple and all other improvements we leave as a monument to our patriotism , industry , uprightness of purpose and integrity of heart , and as a living testimony of the falsehood and wickedness of those who charge us with disloyalty to the Constitution of our country ! Let us all kneel in prayer . " Upon the snow and ice , more than five thousand persons knelt and bowed their heads . P326BRIGHAM TOOK THIS VANGUARD OF THE MIGRATION TO SUGAR CREEK , SEVEN miles from Nauvoo , and encamped there . He decided to complete preparations for the overland journey and push on with this multitude , and allow those in Nauvoo to follow as soon as they could . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some he brought with him . Many of those active in the early years of the church had died or had fled . Joseph 's father had died five years before ; the elder Whitmers had remained somewhere in Missouri ; Newel Knight had vanished nobody knew where ; and the embittered Emma had left the church , after denouncing it , after declaringthat she had never believed a word of it , and had married a tavern keeper . There was snow in the camp , there was a wild frozen storm overhead ; and the temperature day after day stood close to zero . The suffering was intense . Brigham and his leaders had provisioned themselves for a journey of twelve months ; but scores of families came into camp with no food for man or beast or with only a little , and soon all that Brigham brought with him he had given away . Daily men with hopeless eyes and gaunt bodies came to him to beg food for their oxen or their children . " Damn it , " Brigham roared at one , " you did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ food ? " " Brother Brigham , I brought all I had . The mobs burned my crops . " " Well , go to my wagon and get a helping . " A few minutes later he was looking into a wagon where a forlorn widow sat . " Sister , is this all you have ? " " Yes , Brother Brigham . " " Go to Heber Kimball and get something to eat . " There was no grass in this area ; and after the corn was eaten , both horse and ox had to feed off the bark of trees . Brigham stared at the hundreds of beasts foraging for twigs , and drew his waistcoat around him . A year ago he had barely been able to fasten it but now it overlapped byP327twelve inches across his belly . His cheeks were sunken and his eyes had drawn back into his skull . Day after day a blinding blizzard drove down from the north . All clay and far into every night he went among the pilgrims , observing how some had leaned boards or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shelter , with snow sifting between cracks and powdering their hair and bedding ; how some crouched within small tents , without warmth of any kind , and sat there half-frozen , blowing breath on their red hands ; and how others at night slept without shelter on the cold ground while the snow buried them under white mounds . To everyone he spoke a word of courage and hope but he knew that the morale of his camp needed more than his voice . So he brought from Nauvoo a brass band , the members of which had been converted in England . On the fourth day , when the north wind was like a sheet of ice , and the snow was gray desolation upon wagon and tent and tree , Brigham ordered the band to play ; and a Scotch reel sounded gaily from end to end of the camp . Persons came , stooped and shivering , out of their tents ; men went eagerly in search of wood ; and after a few minutes the band played a minuet while a great blazing fire laid its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sing . Come , ye disconsolate ! Where'er ye languish , Come to the mercy seat , fervently kneel ! Here bring your wounded hearts , here tell your anguish ! Earth has no sorrow that heaven can not heal ! .. . Hearing the high mournful voice , hundreds came to the fire ; and presentlythe voices of men , women and children took up the song . Here see the bread of life , see waters flowing Forth from the throne of God , pure from above ! Come to the feast of love , come ever knowingEarth has no sorrow but heaven can remove ! . Brigham stood apart and studied his people . Nothing , he reflected , could defeat saints who sang , or defeat him as long as he could persuade them to sing . It was one of his tasks to urge them not only to pray but also to sing and dance . This task was impossible in the next week . The snow softened and P328rain fell  --  a cold and persistent and terrible rain that soaked everything in camp . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dripped steadily between the cracks of pole-and-board shelters ; it formed a sheath of ice upon wagon and harness and beast . Remembering their warm homes only seven miles away , empty now , abandoned to the mobs , the wanderers huddled in abject wretchedness of body and soul , no longer trying to keep their fires burning or their beds dry , and caring little whether they lived or died . Tirelessly , Brigham moved from wagon to tent , from group to group . Late one night he was attracted by an object under a wind-swept tree . He went over and saw five women huddled above a sixth who lay on a wet blanket on the earth ; and when he stooped to peer more closely , he saw that the prostrate woman was in the agony of childbirth . The other women were holding pots and pans above her to catch the rain , and mak ing awnings of their skirts to protect her from the wind . The sick woman was moaning ; the others were chanting in so mournful a way that Brighamfelt chilled . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ matted around her skull , and that rain was luminous little rivers down her upturnedshoes . Feeling a little sick , he went on but suddenly stopped . He had heard sounds of anguish , low , monotonous , terrible . These , he perceived , came from a lean-to against a wagon ; and upon drawing near , he saw several persons in a dark wet group under the boards . " What 's the trouble here ? " A man looked up . " My wife is very sick , Brother Brigham . I think she 's dying . " " Call a doctor . " " All the doctors in camp are busy . " Brigham fell to hands and knees and crawled under the shelter to look at the woman . She was wet through and chilled to her bones . She was dying . Four small children , shivering like beasts in a storm , were quietly weeping and clutching their mother 's hands . Brigham felt of the children and saw that they also were wet to their skins . He put an ear to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ brow and then turned to her husband . The man , too , looked as if he were at the point of death . " Carry her over to the fire in my tent . Take your children to Brother Heber . "   " Yes , Brother Brigham . " All night Brigham searched through the camp , having fires built around the sick and dying , giving his own bedding to an old woman shaking with chills , speaking cheerfully to those who were numbed by cold and despair . Looking into sagging wet tents , he saw whole families crowded together in one wet bed , the children lying at the feet of their parents and trembling like a newborn colt in a winter morning . It was a gloomy and terrible place , this Camp of Israel  --  for that is the name Brigham had given to it . Even the horses and oxen , scattered everywhere , were humped up as if frozen rigid in the darkness and the rain . Back and forth Brigham prowled , his mind busy with many things ; his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had allowed thousands to be driven from their homes in midwinter ; of mobs waiting over in Illinois to plunder and possess ; of a noble temple that was standing in the rain this night , soon to be used for nobody knew what . Across the river were twenty thousand saints , among them the feeble and old and sick , making preparations to follow ; and in many cities and hamletsin the eastern states , other thousands were getting ready to move . An entire people was on the march . He smelled something that was like burning leather . He sniffed the wind , trying to tell whence the odor came ; and saw a tent , set far back , that had a golden glow in the sagging canvas . Going to it he looked in and was astonished . A foolhardy man had built a fire close by his bed in the tent , and was now snoring soundly with his whole family while his boots burned at the fire 's edge . Flame was smoking and hissing along the wet bedding . Brigham stooped and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of sleepy alarm , the man sat up and reached for a gun . " You trying to set a funeral pyre ? Look what you done to your boots ! " " By God ! " the man said . He snatched a frying boot and struck it on the earth . " What 's the matter ? " asked the wife . " We 're burning up . " In consternation he added : " By the God of Israel , look at my shoes ! " This night was only one of many in which a desperate multitude fought against rain and cold . For two weeks Brigham remained here , waiting for the rain to stop , preparing for the long journey , and receiving dailyP330reports from Nauvoo . During the day , the men repaired or strengthened their wagons and harness , or went into Iowa countryside to buy provisions , or remained in camp to nurse their sick . From outlying regions , many curious gentiles came . They were surprised by what they saw . They were amazed when told that this camp of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't you wait till spring ? " " Because , " said Brigham , " the damned Christians drove us out . " " Why did n't you stay and fight until the last dog was hung ? " " Because we would have been hung with the dog . " The inquisitor looked at Brigham and pondered . " How far is it to the Rocky Mountains ? " " About fifteen hundred miles more or less . " The man turned gravely to a companion . " By hell , I 've got a notion to go too . I do n't want to stay around such neighbors . " " Better join us , " said Brigham . " I 'll baptize you right now in Sugar Creek . " " Wait till I ask my wife . " When possible in the mornings or afternoons or evenings , Brigham had the band play . Stirring music did much to cheer the saints , even though the musicians stood under naked trees in the rain , with water running from their clothes and instruments . Always before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the multitude in prayer ; and then said : " Sing songs of faith and hope . If you keep your faith , God will be with you . " After a week , a part of each day was spent in listening to complaints . Men came to him and said their supplies were being stolen  --  and stolen not by pilfering gentiles from the countryside but by saints in the camp . " Someone stole all my harness , " said a man , looking bleakly at Brigham . " I ca n't budge a mile without it . " " When did this happen ? " " When I was away working to get some corn . " " Why did n't your wife watch it ? " " She was too busy nursing the sick . " " Well , watch your stuff . They 're not all saints in this camp . We have damned hellhounds among us . Now get busy and make yourself some more harness . "  |p331Brigham  's chief assistants were Heber , Parley and John Taylor . Parley Pratt was a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ zest , his laughter , his appetites ; for his first wife , Mary Ann , had learned that he had other wives and had abused him savagely and walked out . Where she had gone he did not know . When Brigham entered Parley 's tent one morning , he found that strong man bowed in grief . " What 's the trouble ? " " Oh , " said Parley , grinning feebly , " no more than usual . " " You still thinking about Mary Ann ? " " I guess so . After all , she was my wife many a long year . " " Straighten up , " said Brigham , his face touched by sardonic amusement . " Some of the sisters do n't have the spirit of the Lord in them . It 's better to let them go . Besides , Parley , some of us have to keep whistling or this whole camp will lie down and die like a bunch of sheep . " " I know it . " " Did you know we have thieves among us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Find out who they are if you can . If we catch them , we 'll leave them in a tree with a rope necktie . " Parley squared his heavy shoulders . He felt a little better . " I 'll see if I can catch the scoundrels . " Brigham went next to Heber 's tent and looked in . " Heber , how are you this fine morning ? " " Fine morning ! " cried Heber , and looked out at a drizzling rain and a dead sky . " In the name of God , is this ever going to stop ? " " We 're moving in the morning . There 's no use to stay here and freeze to death . " " You think we can get to the Rocky Mountains ? I think we 'll all die on the way . " Brigham entered the tent and put a hand on Heber 's broad shoulders . " Of course we 'll get there . Indians and wilderness are less dangerous than Christians . Besides , we 'll be out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " I 'm ashamed of myself , " he said , " but all this infernal rain and snow and sickness and dying gets a man down . Three babies were born dead last night . And under the boards over there one of the mothers is dying . " " We all have to die , " said Brigham . P332As Brigham turned away , he saw the Bigelow sisters , Mary Jane and Lucy : they were healthy attractive girls and for a few moments he watched them as they walked arm in arm in the rain . It had been a month since he had taken a wife . He had nineteen wives but he was living with only seventeen and they were all back in Nauvoo . Just before leaving the city he had married four women in one day ; and they were , he admitted to himself , a strange quartet : one was thirty years old , one was only seventeen ; the third was one of Joseph 's widows , and the fourth was a Quakeress by birth . After considering the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ propose to the Bigelow sisters . It would be better to wait until the camp was moving , but he might stroll over and pass the time of day . " Sisters , how are you ? " " All right , " said Lucy , a lass of sixteen . " The rain has n't broken your spirits ? " " No , Brother Brigham . " " Do you have a dry place to sleep ? " Mary Jane 's blue eyes were looking at him curiously . She was twenty . She had a sweet mouth , an aquiline nose , and rich dark brown hair . " It is n't bad , " said Lucy . " When we get soaked we get up and dry out . " " Do you have food ? Mebbe you 'd like to eat at my wagon tonight . I have wild turkey . " " I do n't know , " said Lucy doubtfully , and looked at her sister . " Of course we will , " said Mary Jane . Several persons ate by the fire at Brigham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quietly studied them . They were ill at ease under his gaze . Lucy dropped a turkey wing in her lap and then giggled and flushed a rosy red . They were attractive girls . Brigham had observed them in the ballroomin Nauvoo , but he was not sure what they would be like in the nursery and the kitchen . By the time the meal was finished he had resolved to offer them marriage ; and he rose and walked with them among the naked trees . The rain had stopped but the sky was chilled and dark : it was no evening for romance but Brigham was not a romantic man . He went straight to the point . After explaining celestial marriage and pledging them to secrecy , he asked : " Sisters , will you marry me ? " P333Mary Jane turned startled blue eyes on Lucy whom she regarded as a child . " Your glory in the next life , " said Brigham , " will be much greater , and your happiness will be much greater , if you marry me . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ understand that . " Mary Jane 's voice was tart . " How many wives are you allowed to have ? " " As many as I can take care of  --  if the Lord is willing . " " Is the Lord willing for you to marry us ? " " I 'd not ask you if He was n't . " Lucy turned to her sister . " It would be nice to marry the same man . Then we would n't have to be separated . " " That 's true , " said Mary Jane dubiously . She looked Brigham up and down as if to see how handsome and strong he was . A little maliciously she asked : " How many wives do you have now ? " " That , " said Brigham , " is a secret . " " Would you , " asked Mary Jane boldly , " love us as much as the others ? Do you love all your wives just the same ? " " Just the same . I have no favorites . " " When we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " will we all live in the same house ? I mean could we have a little house of our own ? " " We 'll see when we get there . " He smiled . " We might all have to live in tents or dugouts and eat grasshoppers and roots . " " Well , " persisted Lucy , " we want a little . tent by ourselves . Or  --  or a dugout . " " You must n't think of frivolous things . " " Oh , it is n't so frivolous . Women , you know , do n't get along together very well . We would n't want to be quarreling all the time with your other wives . I think it 's very sensible for us to want to live alone . Do n't you , Mary Jane ? " " Yes , " Mary Jane said . " We 'll see about it , " said Brigham . They had come to a hill and now stood together , looking across a drenched landscape to black clouds in the west . " Somewhere @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ build the Lord 's kingdom for His chosen people . We 'll start tomorrow . " " Tomorrow ! " cried Mary Jane . " Yes . Meanwhile , you think this matter over . I want you to marry me , P334but you must also keep it a secret and tell nobody or the Lord will be very angry with you . " " But a lot of the saints , " said Lucy , " know about celestial marriage . I 've heard about it for years . " " They do n't know about it , Sister Lucy . They just think they do . " Shyly , awkwardly , he patted her shoulder . " Well , you talk it over and let me know . " " We will , " Lucy said . Brigham went down the hill and came face to face with Moroni and Tim McBride . He looked at them closely . Tim looked shrunken and sallow and half-starved and his eyes were cold and unfriendly . " Brother Tim , have n't you forgiven me yet for marrying your girl ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " There 's no sense in holding a grudge . Celestial marriage is still a secret , but if you or your father wants another wife , I 'll let you take one . I 'm letting only the leaders take wives but you two can if you want to . " " I do n't want to , " Tim said . Brigham looked at Moroni and envied his soft brown beard . It looked almost as fine as silk . " Brother Moroni , do you want another wife ? " " I been thinking about it , " said Moroni , his bright eyes twinkling humorously . " I know a sister named Maggie Williams that I might marry . But she has a friend , Agatha Thornberg , and they do n't want to be separated . " " All right , marry both of them . It 's sometimes better not to separate families and friends . " Brigham considered a moment and smiled broadly . " When we get settled in our new home I think I 'll advise the brethren to marry their mothers-in-law @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take care of that problem . " Moroni grinned , but there was no mirth in his son 's eyes .   THE NEXT MORNING WHEN THE THOUSANDS OF EXILES STARTED ON their journey , the camp was a picture of overwhelming confusion . Brigham had assigned the men to companies , with a leader to each ; and the captains ran around like wild men , trying to get their divisions together . They were angry , because every captain had among his men a few who were lazy and shiftless , and unable or unwilling to harness a horse or yoke an ox . The weather was intensely cold , with dry hard snow riding on a stinging wind . Some of the men hugged tiny fires or jumped around the fires , rubbing their hands and beating their breasts and watchingother men labor . Some of the women , more energetic and eager than their husbands , led beasts in from the countryside and strove to hitch them to wagons . Children ran everywhere , frozen and frightened . Brigham went from company to company , cheering and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moved out and took the road . It was an amazing spectacle . The wagons in this camp were of every kind known to frontiersmen . Those able to afford them had large prairie schooners with thick canvas stretched tightly over the bows ; and in each of these , drawn by two or four horses or oxen or in some instances by both horses and oxen in mixed teams , were women and children with bedding and provisions heaped around them . Men and children afoot drove the loose cattle , blowing on their cold hands and hallooing . Behind a huge schooner , as likely as not , went a rattling cart , or a two-wheeled trundle large enough only for a sack of flour , a pile of bacon and a child . Division by division , with wagon and cart and trundle , with oxen lowing and horses whinnying , with men and women shouting above the howling of infants and the cries of the beasts , the Camp of Israel moved out and took the deep mud of the road . Company by company it fell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a long thin line . Some of the saints had chickens with them which they had in crates roped to the rear end of the wagons ; and as the wheels jolted and squealed , a hen or a rooster would thrust a headP336up between slats , look around , and then vanish as if appalled . Some of the women  --  and even a few who were elderly  --  preferred to walk , so clamp and cold were the wagons ; and they trudged in snow and mud on either side , or went afield to assist in driving the cattle . Hundreds of men also walked , with little to do except to sink low into their coats and beat their breasts against the wind . When every division was on the move , the caravan was two miles long . During this bitter day , the first of his long and desperate exodus , Brighamrode a horse , going up and down the line and helping one person and another out of trouble . Many of the overloaded wagons sank in mud to their axles and held fast @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and then one would furiously climb down from his wagon and kick his horses or oxen and then blow on his hands and consider ; whereupon with renewed anger he would smite his gaunt creatures again and cuff their ears . " Stop that ! " Brigham roared at an angry man who was flogging an ox with a piece of wet frozen rope . " You ca n't pull that out . " " Then what in hell , " asked the man , looking around him , " am Ito do ? " " Double up with the team behind you . " " If I do that every time I get in a mudhole I 'll never get anywhere . " " Man , do n't you realize those beasts are half-starved ? It does n't do any good to beat them to death . " " They ai n't no hungrier than I am . " " Double up . And do n't let me see you beating your teams again . " And to another : " Why do you set up there like a donkey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " The man grinned . " I would n't lighten a load much . I 'm just skin and bones . " " So are your horses . Here , " said Brigham to the teamster behind , " double up . " " Yes , Brother Brigham . " All of the animals were gaunt and underfed and shamelessly overburdened  --  andnone more than William Clayton 's teams . Clayton was clerk of the multitude . He was a small and tidy man with soft dimpled hands , expensive jewelry and clothes . Because the passion of Clayton 's life was order and precision , Brigham had not only made him clerk but had also given to him the task of freighting a large part of the churchP337property , and of acting as its custodian . Clayton had several wagons that were heaped chiefly with flour and bacon and seed . When Brigham rode up , he found one of the wagons sunk to the hubs . Clayton stood aside , gazing dolefully at the teams which stood with closed eyes as if they had frozen or turned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " do n't you double up ? " " Brother Brigham , as soon as I get out of this hole I 'll be in another . I need bigger and stronger teams if I am to freight all this stuff . " " Brother William , " said Brigham , his eyes twinkling , " life is a matter ( 1 getting into holes and out of them . The last hole is three feet wide and six feet long , but we 'll get out of that one too if we are faithful . " " It 's not that hole I 'm worried about . It 's this one . " Brigham rode ahead to another teamster whose wagon had sunk . " Did n't you see that mudhole or were you asleep ? " " Asleep , hell ! The wagon before me got through all right . " " Double up with Brother William . " The teamster crawled down , moving as if he wore garments of ice . He limped ahead and gazed at his oxen . " By God , these oxes is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ take them out they 'd fall over , they 're that weak . " Up and down the long line rode this man whom neither cold nor mudholes , starvation nor exile could make falter or turn aside . He was never heard to laugh but often he smiled , so great was his amusement at the trivial or ineffectual or sad-hearted efforts of some of his people . Among the men were giants who did not have the push and courage of schoolboys : they wanted to sit down and blow breath on their hands when the job was to get a bogged wagon out or lift a fallen beast . " What in hell is the matter ? You think you 'll get to the Rocky Mountainsby setting up there on your hindend ? " The man addressed rose to his feet . Behind him , his wife and children poked their heads out to look at Brigham . " I think I 'm stuck right here until the Lord comes . " " Look at me , " said Brigham , and drew his coat around him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year but I 'll lose another foot before I set down and whine . Did n't the mobs burn your house and corn and hay ? " " They sure did . " " Then I 'd think you 'd want to get away from the Christians . "   " I got a notion , " the man said , " to pull off to the side and build me a house and stay here . " " All right , if that 's how you see it . Then get out of the way so the faithful can pass . " In this day of driven snow , of mud , of burning wind , the caravan made four and a half miles and pitched camp on a hillside . The wagons were drawn into a great semicircle ; and within , a hundred men shoveled and swept the snow away and built a fire . Most of the pilgrims were too numbed , too sick at heart , to warm their suppers , and so ate frozen bread and meat ; but others gathered to the fire @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the way , or held bacon and bread to the flame to thaw them out . After supper was done , the band played ; and a few of the men chose partners and danced . A few of them sang . Strong are your foes , but His arm will subdue them , And scatter their armies to regions afar ! Then they will flee from the scourge that pursues them , For vain are their strength and their chariots of war ! .. . On the second day , after making five miles the caravan had taken on the appearance of a column of mud . All day gaunt beasts fell in their harness and struggled to their feet , blowing mud and water from their nostrils ; or sank in mudholes to their bellies . When evening came , their legs were sheathed and their ribbed sides were streaked with earth . Their tails were ropes of water and mud . Short of provisions , many of the campers went to outlying settlements , seeking work ; and while their wives drove their teams , they split @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ corn and bacon . Others , unable to find work , hunted for turkey and prairie chicken , or now and then shot a deer and rode triumphantly into camp . Those families without food received rations from Clayton 's wagons . " We 'll all support one another , " Brigham said . " As long as one eats , we 'll all eat , and we 'll all starve together . " The hungry inroads on provisions worried him , and very early in the journey he realized that he would have to be infinitely resourceful or his people would starve to death . Bitter weather made for ravenous appetites . When persons came from villages along the way and asked him to send the band over , Brigham eagerly assented ; and the money or foodp339collected in payment was stored in the general fund . All this added to little when divided among thousands ; but all this , too , was only incidental . Brigham had up his sleeve a farseeing plan . Even before leaving Nauvoo , he had decided to stop now and then when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ crops which the next caravan would reap . To this end he had brought machinery and seed . It was a wise and resourcefulplan , this conversion of his vanguard into a marching industrial column that would plant and sometimes harvest and store for the thousandswho were to follow . He had not foreseen the remorseless cold , the depth of the mud , the swollen streams ; and in spite of all his cheerful urging or thundering commands , in spite of the combined efforts of man and beast , the camp moved very slowly , covering only five or six miles in each day . During the evenings , and even while the camp crawled hour by hour , he organized his people , appointing a captain to every hundred families , and asking these in turn to name a leader for each group of fifty and each group of ten , together with clerks and guards . Under such supervision there was less scattering : the camp went forward in compact units , and did not always rest in one body , but spread over a large area @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week , Brigham was forced to halt because of heavy rains and impassable streams . The storm came in such an avalanche that tents were blown down , boards propped against wagons were hurled down the wind , and schooner tops whipped wildly upon the bows and let the driving storm in . The first night in this camp on Chequest Creek in Iowa was one of continuous downpour ; and when morning came , not a person was dry . Many of them were soaked to their hides . Beds were scattered everywhere with fallen tents upon them , and from under the tents , when daylight came , crawled men and women and children , looking like half-drowned creatures emerging from burrows . Nor did those in the schooners fare much better . Because their position was higher and less protected , rain drove in from front and rear and drenched them . It was a forlorn and half-frozen multitude that faced this wild March morning . Preferring falling rain to wet beds , they came out , with garmentsclinging to them like their skins , for most of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hardier men jested about troubles . Porter Rockwell , with his long black hair hanging like a matted cape , fetched an armfulP340of wood and knelt in the rain to build a fire ; but the wood was watersoaked , and after vain effort , Porter rose to his feet and laughed . " By the Almighty God , what we need is an ark ! " " Yes , " said another . " This is the second flood . " " If we had canoes , we could get to the Rocky Mountains . We need boats under our wagon wheels . " " Brother Brigham , we should make us some boats . " Brigham came over . He was wet too and looked unhappy . " I feel like laying down here , " he said , " and waiting for the resurrection . All this damned rain will raise the Gulf of Mexico an inch but it do n't do us any good . " " You think the Lord always intends a rain to do good ? " " I do n't see any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Porter , " He intends to drown our enemies . I guess He figgered we should ought to have sense enough to go west in boats . " The men looked around them . Women with infants at their breasts were walking up and down in the rain , trying to hush their cries while husbands set the tents up . When a tent was ready , women and children entered it , but they could not sit on wet earth and they came out , or stood in the tent doors and stared around them . One man , laughing a little madly , seized a woman and danced up and down in the rain . " If I could keep that up , " he said , " I 'd dry my clothes out . But I 'm too gol-damned hungry . " He pawed into a wet roll and fetched out a hunk of stale bread . " It 's breaking in the east , " said Porter cheerfully . " Soon we 'll be nice and dry . " Brigham , looking as if his God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his hands and down his clothes ; but when Heber came up , as wet as any other , Brigham smiled . " Heber , in comparison with the way the Lord tested His people in the old days , this ai n't nothing at all . " " Nothing at all , " Heber said . " I 'd think , " said Porter , " the Lord has tested us enough . Ai n't that what He 's been doing for years ? " " Call the band over , " said Brigham . " We need music . " The members of the band came over , walking as if they had ice in their P341shoes and wore underwear of frost . From tent and wagon came the pilgrimsto listen . A group of men gathered in a circle with arms around one another and sang . Children of Zion , awake from your sadness , For soon all your foes shall oppress you no more ! Bright over yon hills dawns the day-star of gladness ; Arise , for the night of your sorrows is o'er ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ multitude took up the song . Children of Zion , His power will save you ! O loudly extol it o'er land and o'er sea ! Shout , for the foe will be slain that enslaved you ! Oppression shall vanish , and Zion be free ! .. . Even while they sang , the black sky broke and sunlight fell upon a golden cloud . In a half-hour the sun was shining , though rain still fell , and the appearance and warmth of it transformed the camp . Men scurried for wood and returned with arms laden . Porter fetched a piece of dry board from his wagon and whittled shavings , and knelt to shelter a reluctantfire . Soon the flames were leaping in yellow heat and other fires were built ; and hundreds gathered around to dry clothes and bedding , or to prepare a hot meal . When the rain stopped and the sun shone in full glory , the Camp of Israel hummed like an enormous hive of bees . Aroma of bacon and venison and biscuits filled the air . " You do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " Porter asked slyly of Brigham . " Would n't you like to fill your old belly first ? " " I 'm plumb ashamed of myself , " said Brigham , and accepted a plate of venison . For twelve days the saints remained in this camp ; for every day , every night , it rained . But they were busy . They laid bridges across swollen streams , repaired and reloaded wagons , nursed the sore shoulders of their beasts , and went to the scattered ranches to exchange labor for corn . On the sixth day , Brigham was surprised and angered to see a large company pull in from Nauvoo . It came in creaking old rattletrap wagons and carts that looked as if they were made of mud . " Why in hell , " Brigham demanded of the leader , " are you here ? " " Well , " said the man , " we did n't want a-be left behind . " He looked P342like one who had not slept or eaten for days . " Back in Nauvoo , they @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Brigham roared . " We have n't enough food in the camp now . I told you to stay back there and provision yourselves . " " I know it . " The . ragged fellow looked sheepish but obstinate . " Brother Brigham , we just felt lost without you . We could n't stay . " Brigham went from wagon to wagon to learn who had come . When he saw Eliza Burgess he was startled . A small woman , with large dark eyes that now gazed at him worshipfully , Eliza was a servant girl who had migratedfrom England . When she saw Brigham in Nauvoo she fell in love with him . She had read in the Old Testament that persons sometimes served seven years for what they wanted ; whereupon , she had gone to Brigham 's Mary Ann Angel , known to everyone as Mother Young , and asked if she could serve seven years in her house and then become one of Brigham 's wives . How Eliza had learned that plural marriage existed in Nauvoo , Brigham did not know , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if she wanted to serve , by all means to do so . And here she was , humbly gazing at him , and with five years of servitudeahead of her . " What , " he said , " did you come for ? " " I want to be near you . " " Even if you starve to death ? " " Yes , Brother Brigham . " " Well , you probably will . " After inspecting the company that had moved in , he summoned Porter . " Go to Nauvoo and fetch the mail . Tell the rest of the saints to stay there until I order them to come . Tell Dan Wells that is my command and I want no more damned foolishness . Tell him we 're all freezing and starvingto death out here . " " I 'll tell him . " " And make him understand that I mean it . " " I will . But you know Dan Wells is pigheaded . " It was not the pigheadedness of Dan Wells . The saints in Nauvoo felt deserted @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few belongings into anything they could find on wheels and were setting out desperately to overtake Brigham . Porter said the road from Nauvoo to P343Brigham 's camp was lined with them . Company by company , they were pushing forward through the rain and the mud . When he learned that fifteen thousand of his people were on the way to overtake him or soon would be , Brigham was speechless . Anger was his first emotion ; but after a few minutes , Porter saw in Brigham 's eyes something that was like a mist of tears . Then , suddenly , and still without having said a word , Brigham turned away . He realized now what a stupendous task he had on his hands . P344IT WAS THE MEASURE OF THE MAN THAT HE DID NOT FLINCH . ON THE CONtrary , he moved with twice his customary vigor , realizing that he must push forward at once before the oncoming horde could overtake his camp . For four days with superhuman effort he went ahead , but on Chariton River he was again forced to halt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that the teams floundered and sank and some of the smaller carts all but disappeared . Streams were so dangerous that when fording was attempted , several of the beasts were drowned . For a week Brigham remained on the bank of the Chariton , thinking of his problems and wondering how many bridges he would have to build . He wanted a water route , but the reports of Lewis and Clark and others declared there was none . After a week , he had a bridge across the Chariton and pushed forward to Locust River and stopped again . Provisionswere low . Every person in camp looked emaciated ; some were too weakened for labor . Knowing that his whole camp would die of famine if he did not act quickly , he sent scouts in all directions ; and Porter returned with good news . Thirty miles westward , he said , there was fertile land adjacent to a beautiful campsite . This the camp reached after wallowing in mudholes for another week . For two months it had been on the road and was still less than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Clayton solemnly observed in his journal , made an average of two and one-half miles a day . To Brigham he said : " We 'll be ten years reaching the Rocky Mountains ! " And he gazed at the fine cloth of his trousers which water and mud had ruined . " How long was Abraham on the road ? " " Not ten years , I hope . " " Cheer up , Brother William . We 'll be there in five . " Clayton gazed toward Nauvoo where his favorite wife was soon to have a child . " Five years ? " he said . " You do n't mean it . " " I mean , " said Brigham , " we 'll get there if it takes us forever . " P345The new site was so beautiful that the saints called it Garden Grove . On all sides grassy and flowered hills rolled away in thousands of untilled acres . Right here , Brigham said , they would plow the sod and plant crops ; and within a week the area had been transformed . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eight miles ; and everywhere ox teams drew plows through the rich earth , while other teams dragged harrows behind men who sowed seed from their hands . Five thousand exiles were converted into an agricultural camp . While hundreds planted , others gathered and hewed timbers and built storehouses ; and some , chosen for their skill with rifles , went out daily to hunt wild game . Women repaired garments , nursed the sick and cooked the meals ; and children scattered in search of edible roots and wild fruits . One man set up a shop to mend shoes , another a forge and blacksmith shop , and a third tanned deer hides and made moccasins and gloves . No one except the sick was idle . If a man did not work , Brigham said he would not eat ; and his word was absolute law . Almost daily he sat as counselor and judge to hear tales of theft , of ill will , of petty woes . One of the brothers , said Parley , had challenged another to a duel . " For what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quarrel . He wants vengeance . " " Nobody fights duels in this camp . Send him here . " The challenger came , sulking and obstinate , with the light of murder in his eyes . " What in hell , " demanded Brigham , " are you up to ? Ca n't you mind your own damned business ? " " I do . But no man can call me a lousy bastard and live . " Brigham gazed at the man : he was hulking and evil-tempered , and had an old scar above his left eye . " No man in this camp can challenge another to a duel . You go at once and apologize . " " To hell with it . " " What did you say ? " asked Brigham . " Do you know I 'm the law in this camp ? " " I do n't give a damn what you are . He is going to fight me with pistols or I 'll scalp him alive . " Brigham was angered . He faced the man and tapped him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'll throw you out of camp . " " Oh , I guess you wo n't . " " You have two hours to apologize or get out . " " And if I say no ? " " I 'll find a way to take care of that . " " You mean Porter Rockwell ? " " It 's none of your business what I mean . Make up your mind and be quick about it . " " I wo n't apologize . " " Then get out . " " I wo n't get out . " " We 'll see about that . " Brigham called the members of his High Counciland told them to discharge the man at once . An hour later , the sullen challenger had a slip of paper laid before him . It said he had been discharged from the camp forever , and would leave immediately . He read the note twice and looked up : Porter Rockwell with hands on his pistols was gazing at him . " All right , " said the man . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Porter softly , " the better . " Other men felt the same swift discipline . When a prowling saint stole a beaver from the set of a trapper , Brigham gave him thirty minutes to return the beast and apologize . When another passed counterfeit coin , Brigham had the man summoned to his wagon . " This time you are forgiven . If you do it again , you 'll be thrown out of camp and out of the church , and all your damned bogus money will be thrown in your teeth as you leave . " When several men in a body were accused of theft , Brigham called every division to a meeting and climbed to his wagon . " I wo n't tolerate thieves in this camp ! " he roared  --  and his people knew he was violently angry . " I want to tell you this right here and now , if there are thieves among us , we 'll find a way to take care of them ! " Nobody misunderstood that . They had heard him speak many times of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " And I want to tell you this : the hand of God will rest heavy upon thieves and adulterers and rascals of all kinds ! Brothers and Sisters , I 'd rather die by the hand of the meanest of all men than live among thieves . I tell you by the God of Israel that if there are thieves in thisP347camp and I catch them , they 'll wish they had been born in China of heathen parents and had worshiped idols and lived on rice ! This is the only warning I will give you . If you ca n't follow the commandments of God in this camp , then go back to the Christians in Illinois ! " That was enough : he heard no more of thieves . He did hear of adulteries , but he was too wise to believe that thousands of persons could live in such primitive conditions , with whole families crowding into one bed , and not yield to sexual vices . Adultery was next to murder as a crime against God . He loathed it . He kept his eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that adulterers were too sly and skulking to be apprehended . It was more important right now to plant crops and store food . He had a hundred men splitting rails , ten building fences , fifty building houses , twelve digging wells , ten laying bridges , and hundreds tilling the fields . Within a month , this virgin land had been turned into a huge settlement . The planted seed was coming through and spreading a pale green over the plowed lands . The crops were fenced . Cabins and storehousesand wells were ready for the thousands who were upon the road behind him . When the work was done here , the camp pushed forward again ; again paused in a fertile area to plant and build ; and again moved into the west . Brigham had planned to pitch winter headquarters on the bank of the Missouri River where Council Bluffs now stands . There he would get ready for the long journey overland . But many of his plans were destroyed by his impatient or frightened people . Instead of remaining in Nauvoo , instead of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had set out in their makeshift wagons and rattletrap carts ; and when Brigham reached the Missouri , the road behind him clear across Iowa was an almost unbroken line of exiles . Into the camp at Garden Grove , and again at Mount Pisgah , they came by starved and ragged hundreds , and announced cheerfully that thousands were on their way . Though worried sick , Brigham could not rebuke them : too many eyes filled with tears when they saw him , too many strong men clasped his hand and wept . " We could n't stay behind , " they said , with tears running down their wasted cheeks . " The mobs moved into Nauvoo . "   " All right , " said Brigham , again and again . " As long as I have a biscuit , you will share it . What belongs to one belongs to all . " Day by day , week by week , the multitudes came in . They did not stop to reap the crops at Garden Grove and Mount Pisgah . They were too eager to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mountains . By the time he reached the Missouri River , he had been overtaken by three thousandwagons and carts , thirty thousand head of cattle , hundreds of mules and horses , great flocks of sheep , and fifteen thousand persons . He had set out with a vanguard , and even with so small a number he had faced insurmountable problems . Now he had nearly twenty thousand persons on his hands , other thousands on the way , and winter just ahead of him . " By the God of Israel , " he said to Heber , " we 'll all starve to death this winter . Next spring there 'll just be our bones . " He gazed gloomily out over the saints , scattered for miles up and down the river . " It did a lot of good to plant crops along the way ! " " We 'll send men back and harvest them . I guess we 'll have to build a city right here . Heber , probably the job is too big for me . " " No job , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Working day and night , Brigham and his assistants organized the multitude , until every man in camp knew what his task was . Within a month , the settlement amazed the few gentiles who came from Iowa hamlets to see it . Even Brigham now and then stood on a high bluff and stared in wonder at his busy empire . The country itself was beautiful , with alternating reaches of prairie and woodland : from the picturesquebluffs high above the stream , the landscape fell away on all sides , and down to eight miles of rich alluvial bottomland running south . This bottom was crowded with carts and wagons , it was white with schooner tops and tents ; and in clear blue mornings it was a valley of a thousand tiny fires . Many of the saints had crossed the river and pitched their camps there . Other thousands were in white villages north of the bluffs . Standing on an eminence , Brigham could see his people for miles south , west and north ; and below to the right or left on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with sometimes as many as five thousand in one herd . Most of the men were busy cutting and hauling timber and erecting cabins against the coming of winter , though some were content with dugouts in the bluffs or along the banks , roofed with willows orp349earth . Nearly all of the cabins were twelve by eighteen feet in size , made of cottonwood logs , and roofed with oak timbers split into boards and covered with dirt . Chimneys were made of prairie sod ; doors were of shakes with wooden hinges and a string latch ; the inside walls were daubed with clay . Very few of them had stoves . Those content with dugouts built them of willows and straw in puncheon style and cut a fireplace at the upper end . None of the cabins or dugouts had any floor except the earth , though a few of the more resourceful men gathered hard clay and tried to lay a plaster over the floor to make it hard and dustless . Public buildings were also set up : workshops of various kinds , a gristmillon the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and a stockade . A blockhouse was built for protection against marauding Indians , as well as flanking fortifications that could be manned by guns . Most of the saints had never seen Indians and very few were afraid of them , even though the men carried guns to their work and kept them always within reach . The Lamanites , offspring of one of the Lost Tribes of Israel , were only a degraded and unfortunate people who were to be pitied and redeemed and not slaughtered . Very few of the saints looked upon them as blood-thirsty savages or gave much thought to them . Brigham expected no serious trouble from Indians here because the saints overwhelmingly outnumbered them . While groups of men built , others plowed and planted for the next year , mowed wild hay and stacked and fenced it , and herded the droves of stock . A few made willow baskets , washboards and half-bushel measuresto be sold to Iowans the next spring . The women did much more than wash and cook : many of them labored with their husbands in buildingand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knit and make garments for the journey . Within two months it looked as if an entire county , with all its people and improvements , had been transplanted unbrokento this land . Everywhere throughout the vast settlement went the guiding hand of Brigham Young . He divided the camp into groups and subdivided the groups ; laid out streets and trails ; personally chose the site for every mill and workshop ; established regular mail service between the camp and Nauvoo ; and urged his people to sing at their work , and to dance in the evening when work was done . No person was idle except the sick and old . No person dared be . P350 " Listen , " said Brigham one morning to a man sitting by a tent . " Are you sick ? " " No , " said the man , turning a sour face . " Do I look sick ? " " You look well to me . Why ai n't you busy ? " " Mebbe I do n't want to be . " " Those in this camp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the law . " " Whose law ? " " My law . Get busy or get out . " " I do n't like it here . " " All right : there 's a road east , a road west : take your choice . " Brigham despised laziness . He tolerated no opposition of any kind . A few of the men strove to oppose him , and some , indeed , plotted against his life ; but he had loyal spies everywhere , and a few hours after a plot was hatched , he had all the details . One day Porter Rockwell came to him . " Bishop Miller is mad at you . He wants to go to Texas . " " Then why in hell does n't he go to Texas ! That man has caused me trouble all the way from Nauvoo . How many followers does he have ? " " About a hundred . " " Keep your eyes on him . If he makes a crooked move , I 'll throw him out and kick his hinder as he goes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stubborn Miller was thrown out , and departed with a few followers to join the hotheaded Lyman Wight . In Nauvoo , Lyman had cursed everything under the sun and set out for Texas , taking with him a handful of persons who believed he was the new prophet . There was no use , Brigham had often said , to argue with a mule : you would get kicked for your pains , and it was best to do the kicking first . He knew that an iron fist was the only law that could govern a camp of homeless pilgrims . He reached decisions quickly and he never backtracked . " You say Brother Ben stole a horse from the Indians ? Porter , take the horse back and put Ben in irons for a week . Feed him bread and water . " If some of the men were afraid of Brigham , it was only the loafers , the skulking thieves , the ambitious . Such men he rebuked , not with a sermon , not by trying to appeal , as Joseph would have done , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that laid them out .   " You say Brother Cyrus stole all your bacon ? ' " Yes , " said a gaunt man who looked as if he had never eaten bacon in his life . " Can you prove it ? " " Brother Parley knows he did . " " Parley would not lie . How many head of cattle does Cyrus have ? " " Seven or eight . " Brigham turned to his secretary . " Turn the cattle of Brother Cyrus into the church herd . Tell Cyrus when he gets hungry to come to me . " But suddenly Brigham was called from petty grievances to attend to a grave matter . There rode into camp one James Allen , a captain in the United States Army ; and for a few hours there was tremendous excitement . Couriers ran everywhere , saying that an army was marching against the saints ; and men ran for their guns . But Allen had come only to say that the country was at war with Mexico , and wanted a battalion of five hundred Mormons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ request left Brigham speechless . " By God , " he said at last to Heber , " can you match it ? The government kicks us out and now wants us to fight for it ! Here we are in a wilderness , homeless , facing starvation , and not knowing if we 'll live or die ; and the United States has the infernal brass to ask for five hundred men ! What will the future say about that ? They want us to fight for a flag that allowed mobs to burn our homes , rape our wives , and murder our leaders ! " " Tell them to go to hell , " Heber said . " I will  --  and I hope I can make my words blister like a hot iron . " But after considering the matter , Brigham changed his mind . Here was an opportunity and he was a statesman : he could have five hundred men transported to the west coast without expense to the church ; and besides , they would be paid a wage , most of which would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old . He talked with his leaders and they approved ; whereupon he called the saints into meeting and laid the propositionbefore them . " After our persecutions , " he said , " you may feel it is an insolence for our government to call on us now . Here we are , driven into a wildernessto starve . But we must distinguish between the central government , and the states of Missouri and Illinois . "   " But what , " called a voice , " did the central government do about it ? " " Absolutely nothing . That 's all right : we 're on our way out of the United States . But if a battalion goes , Captain Allen assures me that we can , while we 're in the United States , camp where we please and as long as is necessary on our way to the Rocky Mountains --  " The United States could n't stop us ! " Another voice cried : " I thought we was out of the damned country ! " " Silence ! " Brigham roared . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in its time of need . We still love the Constitution and the flag , even though they did not protect us . Furthermore , we have a chance to get five hundred men to the coast without costing us a cent . I propose that five hundred men volunteer . I 'll see to it that their families are taken to the Rocky Mountains . I pledge myself that they will eat as long as I have a crust myself . " There was silence . Brigham stood in a wagon overlooking the multitude ; behind him on the ground stood Captain Allen and his aides . A voice shouted : " We do n't want to go ! " Brigham grinned . " Well , if we ca n't get enough young men , we 'll call on the old men ; and if we ca n't get enough old men , we 'll take the women ! " " I 'll go ! " said a woman . " Any way to get out west . " " You see ? Here 's a sister willing to go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a battalion of sisters . " " I 'll go , " said a man , and stepped forward . He was joined by a dozen others . Nevertheless , it took Brigham three days to persuade five hundred men to leave . Five hundred wagons and teams , he knew , would be left standing on the prairies of the Pottawatomie and Omaha nations ; five hundred families would be left without guardian or head . Just the same , it seemed wise to him to grasp this opportunity . Five hundred men were induced to go to Leavenworth ; and from that fort a few days later they marched into the southwest . In the Camp of Israel , there were five hundred fewer mouths to feed . Soon there would be a flow of gold from the marching soldiers . Brigham was feeling proud of this piece of statesmanship when Porter Rockwell rode in from Nauvoo . He came with a pack mule loaded with mail , and a mind full of unhappy matters . The mobs had entered Nauvoo , loot-P353ing and burning , raping and murdering ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ river , departing so hastily that they took nothing with them . Now they were starving and dying on the Montrose side . " The saints got ready to fight , " said Porter , wishing he had been there . " They took a old steamboat shaft and made balls for a cannon . They stuffed barrels with powder and hunks of iron and buried them . They reckoned they 'd blow the city sky-high and all the devils with it , but I guess the devils heard about it for they never come near enough to get blowed up . They brung cannon too . They set it right up by Boscow 's store on Winchester Street , and then they fired in Barlow 's old barn just like in Missouri they done in Haun 's Mill . " Porter pulled at his long dirty beard . " How many of the saints were killed ? " " I never did learn . Brother Dan , he did n't know . Bill Hickman says a lot of them was shot and wounded . " " I left Bill there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ damn many mobs to watch . Bill , he was busy , all right . They throwed him in jail but he socked them away and got out . One man was shot plumb in the forehead but it did n't kill him . The mayor of Quincy , Bill says , watched the battle . He was up in the temple tower . Well , another man was hotfootun it across a field and fell down and a cannon blowed one ear off . " " Have all the saints left the city ? " " Just about all . You should see them . It was rainun pitchforks when I left and the only tents they had was blankets over poles . All the women and children was sick , and there was n't enough food in the whole camp to feed a dead baby . Most of the men was gone and the sisters was settun in the rain . " " Christians ! " cried Brigham contemptuously . " Their mouths full of what they preach and their pockets full of what they practice . I guess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They ought to be , " said Porter . " They got a lot of property for nothun . " " Heber , we must send a company to fetch them over . Send bedding . They 'll have to pick up their food on the way . " " Yes , Brigham . " " Get it off at once . How many are there , Porter ? "   " About a thousand . " " How many wagons and teams ? " " I do n't reckon they got a single wagon in camp . " " Send fifty wagons . Porter , you go along . By God , if we do n't hurry , they 'll all be dead . " While worrying about the destitute exiles , Brigham learned that he had a more terrible disaster right in his own camp . The long journey across Iowa in rain and cold and hunger had so weakened the pilgrims that thousands of them now sank under a dread disease which Brigham called black canker . It seemed to be a combination of fever and scurvy : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ extreme cases , the limbs turned black and produced intolerable agony . Some said the disease was from want of vegetables ; others thought it came from the miasmatic stench along the river bottoms ; and a few said it was a punishment from God . The streams feeding the river were sluggish in early fall and as impure as open sewers ; and the southwest wind brought to the camp a foul odor as if it came across a prairie of unburied dead . Brigham had known there was sickness in camp and that a few persons had died ; but not until he rode out in a late September day did he learn how much disease there was . The prevalence of it left him appalled . In a large camp west of the river , nearly half the saints were down ; and as he went from tent to cabin , from cabin to dugout , he felt as if he too were ill . In every one of them , a man or woman or child , or sometimes several in one bed , were stretched out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black , their faces hopeless and terrible . He went to other camps and learned before his inspection was done that thousands were ill ; and he knew that if a remedy was not quickly found , the whole body of emigrants would be wiped out . " Have we no medicine for this ? " he asked a doctor . " Great God , do you realize half the camp is sick ? " " Yes , Brigham , I know it , but I know of no remedy . We are trying everything . In an old fort up north we found some horse-radish and we 're trying that . Potatoes seem good in checking but not in curing it . You 'd better send wagons back to the settlers east of us and buy all the potatoes you can . " " Are we to flee from Christians and die of scurvy ! Is the God of Israel going to desert us now ? "   " You answer , " said the weary doctor . " You 're the leader . Have you ( lied laying on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Prayer was all right , but for his practical mind medicine was much better . If Joseph were here , he would say the Lord was punishing the saints for their sins ; he would say the dread plague was a rebuke from an angry God . For Brigham , sniffing the southwest breeze , it was plain ancient sickness from the bogs and marshes and foul streams . He could lay hands on until he was exhausted , pray until he was purple in the face , but he could not by such methods arrest the inroads of blackleg . God would expect him to use his brains and not his hands . Nevertheless , there was little he could do except to travel from camp to camp , see and hear the agony , touch fevered brows , and hope that cold weather would soon come . Within two weeks , he was horrified to learn that the sick were dying faster than the able-bodied could bury them . He thought he would break under the strain . No matter where he went  --  on prairie , river bottom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on which were scrawled the name and the day of death ; open graves waiting ; or men digging graves , their mouths tight and their eyes bleak . Even more terrible , almost too terrible to endure , were the pictures of desolate agonies in the cabins and tents ... . In one he saw an old woman , alone on an unclean bed , her gray hair spilled around her face and over the pillow ; her arms , almost fleshless a month ago , now swollen to the size of an axle tree , and as black as coal . His hand on her heart told him she still breathed but he knew she would be dead soon . In a second tent he found two children and learned from a neighbor that the parents were out burying the third . These two were far gone in disease : they looked like Negro babies , bloated with plague even in their throats and faces . One of them smiled at Brigham and tried to raise a swollen hand . When he looked into the third tent , Brigham @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ A mother , insane with grief , was sitting by her dead child and crooning to herself and brushing flies away . The child had been dead for some time : the awful smell of it filled the tent ; and he knew that the mother , wholly out of her mind , had been sitting here day after day and night after night , crooning in madness and keepingP356the flies away . He found so many mothers keeping flies away from dead children that for the first time in his life he vomited from nausea . He could not summon men to bury these children . Every man in the camp able to move was busy , digging graves and carting the dead to the cemeteries , or going from tent to cabin with food and water for those who lived . The droves of cattle were shepherdless now . Fences around stacked hay had been broken , and beasts laid waste to the winter 's fodder . Where there had been a thousand fires in a morning , there was now only a handful ; and in the public @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there was silence . Finding a shovel , but feeling weak in his knees , Brigham dug a grave and took a dead baby from its mother . To Heber he said : " Have Brother John tell the grave-diggers not to bother about coffins . Wrap the bodies in something and get them underground . " " How many have died ? " " God knows . Five or six hundred anyway . " Brigham squared his shoulders . " Heber , how are you feeling ? " " I felt funny last night but I guess it was my imagination . " " Take care of yourself . I need you . " " Need me ! " cried Heber . A dry smile warmed his pale face . " It 's you we need , Brigham . You should go back to Pisgah . " " Not me . I 'll always stay with my people . " " But if you get sick " " No , Heber , do n't talk about it . Right now , " said Brigham with a wan smile , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rotten . Do you want to help me ? " " I 'll always go where you go . " Brigham picked up his shovel . " Over here , " he said . " Sister Ansey isout of her mind . You 'll have to hold her when I take the baby away . "   EARLY IN NOVEMBER , COLD WEATHER STRUCK THE CAMP . WHEN BRIGHAM arose one morning to find an icy northern wind , full of sleet , howling wildly over the tents and graveyards , he believed that the ravagingplague would be stopped . He was right : freezing weather was a better medicine than potatoes and horse-radish and herbs . The thousands who were ill began to recover . The gravest danger was past . Nevertheless , it was a most desolate camp . Wives had lost husbands , husbands had buried wives , and in a few families the children had lost both parents ; but the orphans were at once adopted into other homes . A committee was appointed to care for the destitute , and another to supervise the placing and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The crops planted at Garden Grove and elsewhere had been harvested . It would be another bitter winter of cold and want , even though there were hundreds fewer to feed than there had been three months ago . When Sister Ansey came to him , Brigham realized that he had other problems besides want of food . She appeared like a frail ghost of a woman , with uncombed hair framing the fleshless whiteness of her face . " Good morning , Sister . " She did not speak at once . She came timidly forward , her sunken eyes beseeching him . " Are you in trouble ? " he asked , distressed by her tragic appearance . " Brother Brigham , where is my child ? " " Your child ? " he said , but he knew what she meant . " You mean the one who died ? " " Where is his grave ? " " Sister , does it matter ? Your boy is at peace now . " She approached him with supplicating hands , with the horror of the last weeks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " You want to see it ? Come , I 'll show you . " He went with her down the bluffs and to the river bottom , with an arm supporting her as they went ; for she was so weak she could barelyP358stand . They went through a grove of cottonwood trees and came to a small clearing ; and between two rose bushes he showed her a small mound . She stared at the cold unmarked grave , and Brigham looked around him , wondering if she would lose her mind again . With a choked cry that was even more terrible than her eyes , she threw herself face downward and hugged the mound , her thin arms reaching around and over it , her lips kissing the sod . She was not weeping . She was trying to hug the mound to her breast as if to draw her dead baby from its tomb . Unable to endure her grief , Brigham turned away , going like an old man . After he had climbed to a bluff and looked back , he saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ amazed by the number of them ; for they seemed to be everywhere , standing or kneeling by the cold graves . He realized then how lost in grief many of his people were and he knew he would have to bring them back to courage and hope . They could not survive a winter of starvation if they grieved over the dead . For him , death was unimportant : those who had died were at peace now and would rise to glory in the next life . But it was important , with a severe winter setting in , to arouse these thousands from their sadness and make them sing again . After talking the matter over with Heber , he asked for several loads of wood to be delivered close by the stockade ; and he sent messengers to the captains , telling them to summon the saints to Headquarters this evening . At sunset , Brigham stood on an eminence where he lived and saw the thousands coming singly or in groups from all directions . They came afoot and on horse and in carts , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ south . Meanwhile , he had men building a great bonfire on a bluff near the stockade . After darkness fell , this fire was a light and a beacon to the whole camp . Mounting a wagon in full view of his people , Brigham spoke to them , his strong voice carrying clearly to the farthest ear . " My brothers and sisters , there has been suffering in the Camp of Israel , but I ask you to remember that our concern is with the living , not with the dead . Those who have died are at rest in the arms of the Lord . They will come forth at the resurrection and we shall see them all again and live with them in glory . Do not grieve for them . We have a hard winter ahead of us and only half as much food for ourselves or our stock as we need . We mustP359have courage and faith . We must not yield to despair . We must all stand together as one man and support one another ; and if we do that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and all the woes from here to hell . " I want you to join me in prayer and then we will have the band play ; and I want you to gather around this big fire and some others we 'll start soon and sing and dance and forget your troubles . " He paused and looked around him . Then he raised his right hand and bowed his head. " 0 God , our eternal Father , we ask thee to watch over and protect us and keep us in the ways of righteousness , that our hearts may be full of thy spirit , that we may live in thy commandments and do thy bidding . Comfort those who have lost their dear ones and give them courage to face the future and assist in building thy church ; heal those who are now sick and make them well again ; and bless all of us and keep us safe through this winter , that we may resume our journey in the spring and establish thy church where we shall be beyond the reach of persecutionand hatred . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Father , in the name of the Lord , Jesus Christ . Amen . " A solemn amen ran through the multitude . " Now , " said Brigham , turning , " let 's hear some music . " The band was waiting ; and as soon as it began , a thousand voices picked up the melody and sang the words . The pale cold sky was now lighted by a dozen fires . Zion , arise ! Lo , the dark clouds are falling , The dawn of thy triumph cloth joyously beam ! Victory beckons and glory is calling ! Soon all thy woes shall be only a dream ! .. . After a half-dozen hymns , Brigham told the band to play waltzes and polkas and quadrilles ; and in separate groups , many of the saints danced in the firelight . In the square dances , old men called the turns , and younger men sought girls and danced for all they were worth , their faces eager in the glow of burning cottonwood and juniper . Some sang as they ( lanced , others @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , addingto the music and gayety . Brigham stood apart , reflecting on what he saw . He wondered if anything like it had ever been known before : twenty thousand pilgrimsp360driven from their homes into a wilderness , and now dancing by campfires upon great bluffs by a mighty river , with Indians and wild beasts doubt less watching them from the far hills . Twenty thousand citizens of a free nation , driven into a strange land to freeze and starve  --  yet singing and dancing now while thin snow fell on a hundred graveyards ! Even for him , unsentimental and hardheaded , it was an overwhelming spectacle ; and he turned to his friend Heber and wiped mist from his eyes . " Heber , has the world ever known anything like this before ? " " Mebbe in the olden times . Under Abraham or Moses . " " The Jews would understand this . I wish our Christian enemies could see us now . They hope we 'll all starve to death but we wo n't . We 'll pull through . " " Of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 'll find a place where our enemies wo n't bother us . From what Fremont says of the Utah Basin , I think I 'll go there . " " Is it in the United States ? " " No . The Rocky Mountains is the boundary of the United States . " Brighamwatched the dancers . " I guess I 'll dance . Have you seen Lucy ? " Brigham had married the Bigelow sisters , Lucy and Mary Jane . Ilc now went to a far fire , seeking the youngest of his wives , remembering that he had been married to her several months and had visited her only once . When Lucy saw him , she excused herself , smiling graciously at her partner , and came forward to meet her husband . " Let 's dance , " he said . " All right . " It seemed to her that he behaved shyly ; certainly he did not dance well . " Tell them , " she said , " to play a waltz . " " No , the waltz is sinful . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " It is , Lucy . " While dancing with her , he gazed at her youthful face and said : " I 'll visit you tonight . Send Mary Ann over with Eliza . " " Yes , " she said , and smiled to show her dimples . Brigham danced on the frozen ground , feeling stiff and awkward with a girl so light on her feet , and gazing a little enviously at the nimbly young men around him . Well , he reflected , he was only forty-six : a young man still , but by no means as young as he had been ; dancing came rather sedately to men of his age . " Did I step on your feet ? " he asked , knowing that he had .   " Oh , no . You dance very well . " He did not believe that . He liked dancing but it was a bit frivolous and giddy for a man whose job was to build an empire , whose dream was not of fair women but of tilled prairies , factories and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the world . When the dance was finished he released her . " About ten , " he said . He returned to Heber , wondering if he should dance with all his other wives , but not wishing to . Some women were so jealous and unreasonable : his wife Susan Snively , for instance , whose chilled gaze he met as he passed a fire : she had no children and he was impatient with barren women . Besides , if he danced only with his wives , the saints watching might become suspicious and believe that he had more wives than one . " Heber , how many jealous wives do you have ? " " Most of them , " said Heber , grinning . " No matter how a man behaves , it seems that some women have to be jealous . " " I get tired of jealous women . If I marry any more , I intend to be sure they wo n't cause any trouble . " " Likely as not , " said Heber jestingly , " you 'll marry the most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When he remembered it twenty years later , he was not amused . " Is there much suspicion about celestial marriage ? " " I do n't think very much since we left Nauvoo . " " It 's mighty hard to keep it a secret . If all my wives was like Mary Ann , " said Brigham , thinking of his Mary Ann Angel , a quiet and patient woman who gave him no trouble . " Now and then , " said Heber , " I could murder some of mine . If one has a new hat , they all must have a new hat just like it . If , one has a baby , the others blame me because they do n't have a baby . If I smile at one of them , another one says she 's my favorite . " Heber looked at Brigham . " My wives say Emmeline is your favorite . " " Foolishness ! " Brigham cried . " I have no favorites . " " It 's sort of hard not to , " said Heber @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fires , Brigham could see all the groups . Only a few hundred were dancing . The thousands stood back and watched , with mothers and fathers holding babes to theirP362breasts , and other children clinging to their hands or clothes . From time to time , men in groups broke away and dragged fresh logs to the fires ; and constellations of sparks shot upward in great golden showers . Knowing they would dance and sing until the wood was gone , Brighamsaid good night to Heber and slipped discreetly to Lucy 's cabin . He entered softly but with no sense of guilt or shame : celestial marriage was as holy in his mind as charity or love . He found Lucy in the pale gloom of an oil lamp . A small wood stove was red with heat and the cabin was cozily warm , with firelight from an open grate dancing on the bed and walls . " How are you tonight ? " he asked , convinced that health was the most precious of earth 's good things . " All right , " she said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sat on the bed and began to take off his shoes . She did not like that : she wanted him to sit by the fire with her and listen to the gay music of the band . If he had been an ordinary husband , she would have known what to do ; but he was prophet and judge in a great camp , now that Joseph was dead . And besides , he was so big and strong and stern : she hardly knew what to do with such a man , or whether she could do anything at all . She was almost paralyzed when she looked at the firmness and strength of his wide jaws and straight mouth . She sighed and looked unhappily coquettish . After his second shoe fell and he began to pull off his big thick socks , she rose , still wondering how to soften him , and went over , summoning all the boldness she had . She stood before him for a moment and then obeyed an impulse and fell to his lap , her arms seeking his neck . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and finding no kiss there , no response at all , she pressed her lips to his tanned cheek . His big strong arms went around her for a moment and drew her to him ; whereupon , as if that one brief caress should be enough , he lifted her off his lap and set her on the bed . She sighed again and looked at his weather-beaten profile . How many wives he had , she did not know ; but she did know that none of them had softened him to tenderness . She was very young and very pretty : she had always been popular with men ; she liked to coquette and make dimples in her cheeks and show how sweetly she could smile . But he paid no attention to all that and she was baffled . P363With his socks off , Brigham unbuttoned his trousers and shirt and drew them off and then sat in his heavy endowment garments . Lucy did not like them . They were , she knew , symbolic in some way : they were worn by those who had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Holy Ghost . Nobody who wore these garments was supposedever to take them off completely , but always to keep one foot or hand in them while bathing , or changing to clean underwear . Brigham , she reflected next , did not smell very sweet , but nobody did or could in this camp : there was too much labor and sweat , too few places to bathe . Suspenders had made a dirty cross on the back of his underwear . " It 's bedtime , " he said , observing that she had made no move to undress . " I do n't want to go to bed yet . " " I must visit you and go get my sleep . " " Why do you always sleep alone ? " " It is good for a man . Every man should sleep alone in solitude . " " But do n't you ever sleep all night with one of your wives ? " " Never . " She considered a moment . " I want you to hold me by the fire and kiss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " This is no time for romance . " " I do n't want romance . I just want you to love me a little . You 're my husband , you know . " " You are vain , " said Brigham . " The Camp of Israel is no place for vain women . " Lucy flushed with anger . " Is it vain to want my husband to love me ? " " You 're a coquette , Lucy . Remember all the graves on which the snow is falling now . " " But we are still alive . Brigham , do n't you ever kiss any of your wives ? Do you treat them all as cold as you 've treated me ? " " You are being foolish . Come to bed . " Lucy drew a foot to her knee and removed a heavy shoe . She had beautiful legs and one calf was now exposed ; but a sly glance at him told her that he could live with her fifty years and never know what pretty legs she had . She removed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with her dress . Without removing his underwear , he turnedP364the cover of the bed back and crawled in , and then lay with eyes closed , waiting for her . She crossed the room and blew out the light . The fire was sorcerous on the walls and ceiling , but there was no sorcery in this man : if only he would leave the bed and come to her and hold her on his lap by the fire , and listen with her to the gay music of a quadrille ! She wanted to speak to him but she dared not call him Brigham again ; and it would be silly to call him Brother Brigham . " Honey ? " she said , standing by the fire . " What ? " asked Brigham . " Lucy , come to bed . " " Yes , " she said meekly , and went softly to the bed and lay at his side . P365FINDING NOTHING FOR HIM TO DO IN ILLINOIS , BILL HICKMAN FOLLOWEDthe last of the exiles to the Missouri River and reported to his chief @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ self-defense and Bill had not clone so , though he had been tempted many times , He bashed a jailer 's skull to escape ; and when the mobs marched on Nauvoo , he shot five of the rascals from ambush and felt pleased with his afternoon 's work . When he saw haystacks and homes burning , he skulked through the countryside , trying to surprise some of the men who set the fires ; but . ill in all he had rendered small account of himself and felt chagrined . It was midwinter before Brigham summoned Bill to his cabin . Brigham had never worried much about Indians , nor had his people , because they ( lid not share the customary American fear of them . Indians for the saints were not bloodthirsty redskins but the descendants of Laman and the Lost Tribes . They had had a desperate and unhappy past , having long ago been slaughtered , enslaved , and driven into a wilderness ; but for all that they were not savages but human beings with souls to be saved . Curses from both man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mormons , they were to be converted and saved and not murdered . Nevertheless , Brigham , who had seen little of them , discovered that they could be a persistent nuisance ; for more and more they came to his settlement to beg or to steal . " The Indians , " he said to Bill , " are giving me some trouble . I think it 's better to feed the lazy villains than to fight them but I have n't enough food . There 's one , a half-breed , named Antoine Michet . You ever seen him ? " " I reckon I never have . " " He joined the church , but I might a-known he was a skipjack . Anyhow , he 's turned plain damn sinner and swears he intends to scalp me . That ai n't the worst of it . He plans to go ahead of me next spring and get all the tribes together and ambush my train . That 's what I 've been told . "   " I guess , " said Bill calmly , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , what would you do with an enemy like that ? " " I 'd use him up . " " Find out first if he means it . Then if he does , do n't let anyone know what you do . And there 's a horse thief around here who has sworn to murder Brother Orson . " " What 's the villain 's name ? " " I do n't know . Get a description of him from Orson Hyde . " " All right , " said Bill . " Just figger on two enemies less . " " Bill , " said Brigham , looking into the man 's cold eyes , " I expect you to use commonsense . I do n't want the gentiles after me for murder . But I do n't intend to let half-breeds and horse thieves destroy God 's church . " " Count on me , " said Bill , still speaking as if he took such desperate assignments in a day 's stride . " I 'll sock them away so there wo n't be no stories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And Bill , how many of the saints are talking about celestial marriage ? Is it leaking out ? " " A few talk about it . But I guess they do n't really believe it 's true . " " We must keep it a close secret . Do you want another wife ? " " Not yet , " said Bill , grinning . " I took another one in Nauvoo , but Ido n't want to fool with any more . " " All right . Take care of those two villians . " " I sure will . " Here were two jobs after Bill 's own heart . Two cowardly rascals were threatening the progress of God 's church and had to be sent back to the Devil where they belonged . He was as pleased as a small boy . Sometimes , it is true , he felt that Brigham was unfair in not providing him with food and clothes and a house ; for it seemed to him that he should not have to bother with those matters if he were to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him anything  --  not even ammunition or a choice of ponies or a single piece of clothing . In later years he was to grow bitter over the neglect , but now he was happy as he went into his tent to clean and load his pistols and test the edge of his long hunting knife . So the half-breed blackguard had sworn to have Brigham 's scalp , had he ? Well now , Bill Hickman would see about that . He mounted the fastest horse he could borrow and rode through the settlement , smelling out the trail of Antoine Michet , though pretendingP367all the while that he was looking up his old friends . Finding no sign of the rascal in camp , Bill rode northward to the Indian agency and nosed around there ; whereupon , having learned nothing , he went up the river to visit the friendly Omaha Indians . It was on a clear day in January that he first laid eyes on Antoine . The man was tall and straight and looked more Indian than French , though lie had a trimmed beard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like the look of him : he was a scoundrel , all right , as anybody could tell by his stealthy movements and furtive eyes . Bill shadowed Antoine to learn where he lived and then rode back home to ponder and to wait . Thereafter he went daily into Antoine 's neighborhood up the river , declaring he was seeking stock which had strayed from the herds . Antoinerode a great deal too , though for what reason Bill could not determine ; and one day the two men met on a hill . " Hello , " Bill said . " You seen any stray cattle ? " " What brand ? " asked Antoine . His voice was soft and modulated . Brigham had said that to the wiles of the Lamanite , Antoine had added the cunning advantages of a formal education . " A horse with a fleur-de-lis on the left thigh ; and two ox OP on the right ribs . That 's the ones I 'm after today . " " I have n't seen them , " said Antoine . " You seen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a single one . " " Do you ride around here a lot ? If you do , you might keep your eyes open . For cattle , I mean . " For a moment Antoine considered that . " I ride only for pleasure , " he said . " I guess , " said Bill dryly , " it must be a lot of fun . " " You a Mormon ? " asked Antoine casually . " Kind of a jack-Mormon , " said Bill , pretending to be a somewhat stupid fellow . " Are you ? " " No , " said Antoine , politely ignoring the question , " I have n't seen any cattle with those brands . " The next day while Bill was riding , Antoine unexpectedly joined him ; but it was not until their third day together that Bill , still affecting to be stupid and unobservant , became confidential . Pretending to be weary of searching for cattle , he suddenly cried with impatience :   " To hell with them ! Why should I work for the damned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ coyote . " You do n't seem to like the church , " he said softly . " By God , I do n't . " " Why not ? " " Well , I 'll tell you if you wo n't say anything . " " Of course not , " said Antoine . His handsome dark face was smiling . Bill looked around him as if for spies . Lowering his voice , he said : " It 's old Brigham Young . By God , I do n't think he 's any prophet at all . " Antoine considered that . From time to time as they rode along , he looked craftily at Bill , but Bill pretended not to know it . He affected a sulking fury and swore that Brigham was a scoundrel and a fraud . At last Antoine said : " I do n't like him myself . " " Who does ? " demanded Bill vehemently . " I guess the old pod has tried to deacon a calf for you . But he does for everybody . " " He would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Antoine with spirit . " The hell he would n't ! " said Bill , affecting astonishment . " God knows he has plenty . " " How many ? " asked Antoine . " Who knows ? About a hundred . That 's what the hickory Mormons say . " Again Antoine rode in silence but Bill knew what was going on in the man 's mind . He was not surprised when the half-breed asked : " Why do we put up with him ? " " What else can we do ? He has all the power . " " Do n't you think there might be a way ? " " I 've tried to figger out one . I know a lot of the Mormons would like to see him used up . I would , but I do n't darst try it alone . " " I would , " said Antoine . Bill glanced at the dark face and was surprised by the hatred in it . " Alone ? " he asked innocently . " I know a better way , " said @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ trust this man . " When Brigham goes west next spring , we can set the Sioux and the Pawnees on him before he reaches Fort Laramie . They could ambush him and wipe out the whole camp . "   " By God , they could , " said Bill . He was thinking swiftly now . He had learned all that he needed to know . " When Brigham would n't let me have another wife , " said Antoine , growing very confidential , " I told him I 'd dance over his scalp . I intend to . " " I do n't blame you , " said Bill . They were in a deep gully far from the camps , both Indian and white . The spot was all right , Bill decided , but he wanted to ask one more question . " How much money do you want to sock him away ? " " How much , " asked Antoine softly , " am I offered ? " " This much , " said Bill . His right hand had slipped suddenly to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unwavering barrel . " So you aimed to dance over Brigham 's scalp , did you ? " Bill 's voice was as hard and his eyes were as cold as the pistol in his grasp . He looked at the half-breed 's face : it had turned a sickly white and the eyes were yellow with fear . " Brigham , " Bill went on , speaking calmly , " is the Lord 's servant in building up the true church . I do n't allow the Devil 's jack-nasties to get in the way . " His finger pressed the trigger . Antoine spun halfway around in his saddle and clutched at the horn , but in the next moment he gurgled and pitched headlong to the earth . Bill dismounted and tied his horse to a bush . Unless he had erred in judgment , he had shot the villain through the heart ; and he now bent over to see . Yes , it was through the heart , all right . Drawing his knife , and reflecting with a grim smile that he had never scalped @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hair and pressed the sharp blade to the skull . After making an incision clear around the head just above the ears , he pulled at the scalp and skinned it off . For a moment he gazed curiously at the red and bleeding skull and then washed the scalp with snow and thrust it into the pocket of his coat . After he had mounted and ridden a short distance , he stopped to lookback : if the rascal were found , it would be supposed that Indians haddone the job . As likely as not , though , he would be drifted under andeaten by wolves in the spring . Bill rode on , feeling that he had acquittedhimself well . After all , Brigham was a prophet and knew what he wasdoing ; and if sinners threatened to murder him , then the sinners had tobe socked away and sent back to hell . That was the way Bill looked atp370it ; and that , he was convinced , must have been the way the saints had looked at the matter in the days of the Old Testament @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For the half-breed lying back there in the snow with a naked skull , he cared nothing at all , nor even thought of him , except to reflect that one enemy of the Lord would make threats no more . When he entered Brigham 's cabin , he was so pleased that he grinned . " Hello , " said Brigham . " How are things going ? " " They could be worse . You told me that half-breed said he 'd hold a war dance over your scalp . " " That 's what he told me . " " That 's what he told me . He got my dander up . " " He 's a dangerous man . " " Not now , " said Bill . " Now you can dance over his scalp . " And Bill , still grinning , dragged the hide and hair from his pocket . " There it is . " " What 's that ? " asked Brigham , startled . " It 's the forelock of that half-breed . " " Is he dead ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He looked dead as a last year 's snowflakewhen I seen him last . " Brigham looked curiously at the scalp which Bill was holding by the long black hair . " You sure you got the right man ? " " Sure , Brother Brigham . I do n't go around sockun good people out of the way . " " Damn it , you did n't have to scalp him , did you ? " " Well , he aimed to scalp you so I thought I 'd show him how it feels . Except he was dead as a doornail and never found out . " " Stick that out of sight . Someone might come in . " Bill thrust the scalp into his pocket . Brigham looked at the pocket to be sure the horrible thing was hidden ; and then said : " How about that horse thief who swore to kill Brother Orson ? " " I 'm on his trail . " " Where did you leave this half-breed ? " " Away up north in a gully . He 'll be snowed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't get reckless . The enemies of the Lord have to be seen to but I do n't want any trouble . "   " Do n't worry , " said Bill . " I make sure before I act . Why , I even got that half-breed to tell me his plans . He aimed to ambush you next spring and wipe you out . " " That 's what I heard . " " When he told me that , it was an open and shut proposition and I just used him up . He was n't worth a red cent anyhow . " " Bury that thing in your pocket . " " I will . I wanted you to know one of the Lord 's enemies was socked way . " Brigham smiled faintly . " After this I 'll take your word for it . Leave the evidence outside . Have you taken another wife yet ? " " Just the one I told you about . " " Take another if you want one . " " Thanks , " Bill said . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " All right . Now go brush-whip that horse thief . " Bill was on the trail of the horse thief but he was resolved to be sure the man was villainous . He had little reason to doubt it . Orson Hyde had pointed the man out to him and a more desperate-looking brigand Bill had never seen . The man was tall and lean and sly , with the plotting look of a coyote who had been starved seven winters . He rode a sleek pony around the encampment , boasting of his prowess with a gun , of his friendship with Indians , and of his murder of two men one winter when he trapped on a tributary of the Missouri . When the fellow laughed , he showed ugly uneven teeth and narrowed his eyes in devilish cunning . Nobody seemed to like him or trust him . Moreover , he always had money and wore expensive clothing , though he was never known to work . So far as Bill could learn , the man gambled with the more sinful saints and stole from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gamblers ; nor did he drink , for he was determined to keep himself pure in the sight of God . The braggart 's name was Heb Sudworth . Bill sized him up one afternoon and wondered how he could get the loud-mouthed cutthroat off alone . It was February before an opportunity came . Heb was full of bad whiskey which he had bought nobody knew where ; and his boasting was unusually loud and insolent . " There ai n't a Mormon in camp , " he said , " I ca n't whip with fists , knives , guns or giant powder . Not a ringtail roarer in the whole outfit ! "   " How about Porter Rockwell ? " asked Bill solemnly . " Him ? " asked Heb , and slapped his breast . " Tell him to come with his old shootun irons ! I 'll set him a lareover for meddlers ! I 'll make him a nice little funeral three feet by six ! " " I reckon you would , " said Bill . " You know Jim Bridger ? I made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ went off on his ear but when I yanked the old smoke-iron out , his bravery was about as fat as a hen 's forehead . He just grouted down and shut up his head . " " The damn coward , " said Bill . An hour later Bill caught Heb alone . " There ai n't any brave men in this camp , " he said , " but I know a redskin down the river who 'd sock you away in a twinkle . " " A Indian ? " asked.Heb in amazement . " A Indian who 'll fight me fair and free ? " " Yes . At least he said he would . " " In the name of the lick-spittun Christ , show him to me ! " " Come , " said Bill , and they rode away . " I guess you do n't go in much for fightun , " said Heb , leering at Bill . " No , I 'm sort of timid . I like to watch a good fight , though . " " Dodrot your skin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Heb gazed at the pistols at Bill 's waist . " What do you carry them smoke-irons for ? " " Oh , " said Bill , trying to look very sheepish , " they make me feel braver . " Heb slapped his saddle horn and roared . " I guess you 'd jump right out of your skin if one went off . " " Like as not , " said Bill . After a moment he added : " I hear you 're sort of mad at Orson Hyde . " That made Heb almost fall out of his saddle with rage . He reached back and yanked a bottle of whiskey from a saddlebag and drank and wiped his mouth . " Who told you ? " " I do n't know . I heard it somewhere . " " Listen , " said Heb , leaning over . " That yellow-livered little pot-gutted son-of-a-she-wolf ! You want a-know what I aim to do with him ? I aim to skin his face off and stand on the hide ! " " Why ? " asked Bill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you why . He told me I was a horse thief . He said I stole horses from the Mormons and sold them to the Indians . " " Did you ? " " What I do , " said Heb , " ai n't no man 's business but my own . Nogallows-faced swag-bellied Mormon can call me a horse thief and live . " Bill glanced around them . They were several miles down the river . Pretty soon now , Bill said to himself , I 'll sock this sinner away . " Where is this Indian who wants to meet Heb Sudworth ? " " Not much farther . You better get yourself ready . " Heb took another drink from his bottle . " I 'm ready for anyone , even the Devil himself . Did n't I tell you I scart Jim Bridger yellow in the face ? " Bill wondered if he should not give this braggart a sportsman 's chance . After all , it was no fun to draw a bead on a man and bore him through the heart : any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a quicker or more deadly shot in this whole country than Bill Hickman , then Bill wanted to know it . Gently he said : " So there ai n't a Mormon in camp who will stand up to the rack with you . Is that what you told me ? " " Not a one , " said Heb . " The pack of cowards ! No wonder they was chased out of Illinois . " " Now me , " said Bill , " I 'm a Mormon . " " Sure you are , you lily-kidneyed coyote . You carry smoke-irons around to make you feel brave . " Heb roared with glee and slapped his bottle " You need a drink to give you some courage . Here . " " No , you drink it . You need the courage . " " What do you mean ? " asked Heb . " I mean I 'm the Indian buck I told you about . " Heb did not understand that . He stared . " You 're no Indian , " he said . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bill stopped his horse . " I 'll tell you . You see that grove of cottonwoods down there ? All right : you dash down there and turn as quick as hell and see if you'n put a bullet anywhere inside my clothes . " " What ? " asked Heb . " You mean that ? " " Sure I mean it . " " But you said you was afraid . " Heb looked around him , unable to make sense of this .   " I do n't think you can shoot , " said Bill . " I think you 'll miss me a mile . " Heb grinned . " You must be crazy , " he said . " God damn it , I 'll just murder you . " " Take another drink of whiskey , " said Bill . " You 'll need it to keep you warm . You 'll be lying in the cold snow in a minute . " " You serious ? " asked Heb . This unexpected turn of events had sobered him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " You drunken horse thief , I 'm giving you a fifty-fifty chance . You 'd better ride . " Heb was flabbergasted . He looked at Bill and then gazed down the river at the grove of cottonwoods . " You must want a-die , " he said . " I 'll just murder you . " " Ride ! " said Bill . Heb drew a pistol and galloped away . At thirty yards he wheeled and fired , and Bill waited until he saw smoke from the gun . In the next instant he sent a bullet into the man 's breast . Heb clung to the saddle and strove to fire again but after a desperate effort he fell , and his horse vanished in a cloud of snow . Bill rode over and dismounted . Upon seeing that Heb still breathed , he fired into the man 's brain and then with his toe rolled the body over . Replacing his pistol , he seized Heb by the heels and dragged him to the river and threw him in . He returned and covered the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Brigham . " What is it ? " asked Brigham . " You remember the horse thief who swore to kill Brother Orson ? " " Yes . " " I thought you 'd like to know he 's changed his mind . " P375BiLL WAS INVITED OVER TO TAKE SUPPER WITH BRIGHAM . THE TWO OF THEM sat to a roast of venison , boiled potatoes and bake-oven bread . " It tastes darned good , " said Bill . " In the last year I ai n't always had enough to eat . " " Nor me , " said Brigham , drawing his coat around him . " I 've lost forty pounds in a year . " After a moment he added : " Bill , I asked you over tonight because I want you to understand some things . You know I 'm not a man who minces matters . God commanded the prophet Joseph to build up the true church , but the world is full of sinful people who will stop it if they can . I do n't intend to let them stop @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ righteousness . If it 's lived for the Devil , then it 's worth no more than the coyotes out on the prairie . " " I know that , " said Bill earnestly . " I want to work for the Lord . " " If I let scoundrels out of hell stop me in building the true church , I would n't be worth a red cent . Somewhere out in the Rocky Mountains I 'm going to establish a kingdom for the saints . Now and then there 'll be a devil in human form who will try to destroy us . Such hell-begotten rascals have to be sent back to hell . " " You can always depend on me . " " When I leave next spring I 'll take Porter Rockwell and some others with me .

If you should kill @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Bill grinned . " The Lord does n't forgive mistakes so I do n't intend to make any .
