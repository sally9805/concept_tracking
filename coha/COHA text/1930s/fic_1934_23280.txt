THE BULFINCH HOUSE A STORY BY JOHN AUGUST HE east was gray when Emery I Mayo turned off 112 , to make by grass-grown lanes for the tops of the hills , and when he left the car and loaded his gun he timed sunrise above the Edgecomb hills at seven minutes past six . New Hampshire burned with a thousand smokes as a northwest breeze lifted mist out of the valleys . He had started down the far slope of Edgecomb when a grouse rose angling for a blackened thornapple . He dropped it and , looking northward , saw blue sky where the hills drew together in a notch above which , in an hour , the Presidential peaks would be visible . He killed his second bird in a tangle of elder and his third a mile farther on . Enough . He would give them to Judith Hardinge , who would turn them over to Polly , and , after a morning 's sport , he would have his garage open by eight-fifteen . He broke the shells out of his gun and stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessening mist . Then , hunger suddenly crowding out thoughts of his fiancee , he made for an old wood road that would take him back to 112 . It was still " the Perkins place " that he crossed , though seventy years had passed since what was now black growth had been wheat fields , and the cellar hole could be found only through the twisting roots of arrow-wood . " Nobody but I knows wherethe well was , " he thought , " and I should n't know except that a dog fell down it when I was twelve . Makes it twenty-five years ago . " The hills nourished a tenacious race , but no tenacity had served to keep the Perkins place alive . All that was left of it was the canted half of a barn roof rotting . Emery stopped still like a dog at the point . Automobile tires had bent the weeds since the dew started to fall the night before . His quick glance found no movement and in a moment he followed the tire marks to that decaying pitch of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ load covered with canvas . Hardly needing to , he looked under the covering . Probably no automobile before this one had climbed to the Perkins place , and the first to open that forgotten pathway was a liquor truck ! They brought the stuff over the border into Vermont in passenger cars , then transferred it to trucks which roared all night long southeastward through New Hampshire . The business was ending now , a few months more would see the last of it ; but someone from Collamore had been picking up good money driving contraband . Only someone who knew the township intimately could bring a car through lanes and bog paths and wood roads almost to the top of Edgecomb . An unwilling suggestion that he could not repudiate rose in Emery 's mind . He raised the hood . His practiced hands lifted the rotor arm from the distributor . He stepped back into the undergrowth and made off downhill . When the truck 's owners came for their four thousand dollars ' worth of whisky , they would have to do some heavy towing . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Mayo garage . Collamore was awake in bright October as he drove back along 112 . Jessie Singer , whom Roger Hardinge would marry , waved to him from her father 's dooryard . A red roadster shot down the highway , swerved round him and roared on , doing at least eighty . A booze-filled tourist , he decided , on his way home from Canada . A lane led off to Oscar Garceau 's , and Emery could see a wagon half-loaded , children crowding about it . He stopped his car and for a moment despised these slovenly fields . Shiftless and spineless ! No wonder Oscar was giving up , moving back to Quebec . He had n't iron enough for the hills , which would take back these rich fields as readily as they had recaptured the Perkins place unless opposed with more vigor than Oscar had . But Oscar had paid Judith Hardinge no rent for three years now . . . . October second , after Sunday the first . That made Judith 's birthday coincide with quarter-day  --  with dividends that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Garceau 's genial acceptance of defeat . Ira Peavey , his highway police uniform shiny , drew up his motorcycle , grinned , and looked in the back of Emery 's car . " Three , huh ? " Ira spat learnedly . " Cleverest hunter west of East Collamore , hai n't you , selectman ? ' Twa' n't you gettin ' ambitious to open the pa'tridge season at about three o'clock this morning ? " Ira flared his upper lip and squinted ? his knowing expression . " Be bucolic , " Emery urged him . " Be the rural sage , Iry . What happened ? " " Counted five trucks slammin ' by . Then there was some shootin ' ? down by the new bridge , I 'd judge . If I had to guess , I 'd guess a high-jackin ' party . " The rotor arm was suddenly hot in Emery 's compass pocket . It must be ignored , for ample reasons . " The wise cop stayed in bed ? " he asked easily . " Evidence all gone this morning . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No , Emery , we do n't interfere in arguments that ai n't thawed to our attention . What you just overhear do n't violate the peace and comfort of the commonwealth . " Having achieved humor , Ira started his engine and , waving , swept grandly down 112 . Emery went on . At the new bridge the road crossed a hairpin curve of the Wiannetchee  --  it was a shrewd place for hijacking . The road turned northward and Collamore became a long street under flaming maples . Higgins 's store was open , but Doe . Whipple had not unlocked his pharmacy , the school yard was empty , and white shutters covered the windows of the rose-brick library . The maples ended and a row of spaced elms burned golden against sky and lawn  --  the Mall . The Mall . Lawns led back for an eighth of a mile to terraces and the seven houses of Collamore . No cars were parked under the elms , no one was taking snapshots , and the Rev. Forsyth Burroughs was probably still in bed . But Emery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Better single examples of the high phase of the Federalist style exist , but no such distinguished group can be seen anywhere in America . Our town was already seventy years old when the first of the seven houses was erected in 1810 . That was the Bulfinch house , at the south end . Constructed by local craftsmen from plans drawn by Charles Bulfinch for the Honorable Jahez Hardinge . . . " The Bulfinch house  --  Judith Hardinge 's house . Her religion too , and her frustration . Emery took up his gun and grouse and went round to the kitchen door . Birch smoke was fragrant in the Fall air . Philip Storrs , the ex-architect and Lydia Hardinge 's husband , was bringing an armful of kindling from the whitewashed shed . He smiled at Emery and said , " The young cub is back . Now you can hold him under water till he stops bubbling . I would n't advise you to take the chill off the water . " So Roger was back after another unexplained absence . This one had lasted four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their uncommunicated trouble . Philip stacked the wood in the bin by Polly 's stove and went on . In muddy breeches and splashed , expensive boots , Roger Hardinge sat on a tilted chair and looked morose . But Polly , kneading bread on a white table , shook a curl from her forehead and smiled . " There 's coffee and rolls and jam , but it is n't time to get Lydia 's tray ready and I ca n't stop to make breakfast for you . I would n't let you eat the apple pie , Emery , not even to make you feel like a Yankee . Thanks for the grouse . Too bad they have n't been hung for Judith 's birthday dinner . " Filling a cup with coffee , he opened the oven to glance at six browning loaves of bread . Alone of the Hardinges , Polly made no problems for Judith . At nineteen she was as she would always be , competent and serene , superbly adapted to Collamore . All the Hardinges married  --  all but Judith , who only @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would finish his interneship in December and would come home : Polly would then move three houses up the Mall . Glass and china , copper and brass would shine for her in the Fanning house as here . While food could be cooked , lint and dust overcome , floors and furniture kept comely , Polly Hardinge would exalt her heritage . Emery took doughnuts from a yellow crock . " What happened to your bread mixer ? " " You 'll love that . It has to be welded or something . It 's in the pantry . " " Not welded , " he reported , investigating . " New shaft . I 'll turn one . " He put the mixing arm in his pocket , and his eyes approved many shelves of bottled tomatoes , corn , beans , peas , beets  --  labeled , dated , alphabetically arranged . The home farm was worked on shares , and this was Polly 's harvest . Catsups and relishes made splashes of color up one corner ; there were jellies and jams and marmalades on the south @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and squabs . He came back to stand by the range . " Also , Judith 's loom is reported out of kilter , handy man , " Roger said unpleasantly . " You can exhibit your Yankee cleverness tinkering with that . The fallen aristocrats will be grateful . " " Making a stay are you , Roger ? " he inquired . " So where have you been ? " Roger stood up , picturesque in outing clothes . He had been more picturesque still going down brown turf under punts , the white 29 on his green sweater cheered by all Dartmouth . He was sulky now  --  or worse , for anger and excitement mingled with his sullenness . " You 're a big frog , are n't you , Emery ? " he said . " The bourgeois of Collamore , and maybe some day you 'll be living in the Pulfinch house . Selectman , school board , fire warden , small capitalist . Still I do n't have to account for myself to you . " Roger went out of the kitchen . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ permitted to gaze on a varsity left end . Nothing to use his energy on  --  so it was curdling him . " When did he get back ? " Emery asked . Polly 's face expressed nothing . " The young squire was in the kitchen when I got up to make breakfast . It had n't occurred to him to light the fire . " As a city-dweller and an expectant mother , Lydia , Phil Storrs 's wife , was entitled to sleep late , but Judith must already have spent an hour and a half burnishing her house . Emery leaned his gun in a corner of the kitchen and went through the house to the great room that overlooked the Mall . Photographs of the chimney piece , the interior cornice , the centerpiece of the ceiling , had appeared in many architectural journals , but Judith had never permitted her furniture to be reproduced . Sun poured through northern windows that framed elms bordering the Cutter house next door . Suddenly Emery hated this rectitude of mahogany and glass and white paneling . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had walled off Judith from everything her life should have been . Roger was looking out across the green sweep of the Mall , and Roger also was part of Judith 's denial . " Do n't need to be any bigger fool than 's natural to you , Roger , " Emery said impulsively . " Why not stop mourning about not being able to go to Boston Tech ? If you ca n't , you ca n't . The time 's come to get to work . " Roger swung round from the window , savagely angry . " I 'm fed up with your preaching ! I did n't make the world  --  you 've got me mixed up with God . What can I work at ? " " Might work at controlling your vocal cords . . . It 's intelligent to do whatever you find at hand . Plenty of work right here in Collamore . " " Help Harry Marsh rake leaves ? Or should I open a garage and make droll Yankee aphorisms while I wipe grease on my pants ? Thanks , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Besides , " Emery pointed out , " you 'd have to borrow your capital from Judith . " Red flared in the tall young man 's cheeks . The last four years , though they had only speeded up the slow evaporation of the Hardinge money , had shown Roger the ignominy of dependence . " Maybe you 've heard I want to get married , " he said . Emery nodded . " Aim to bring another family into the Bulfinch house ? " That raked deep . " Do you want me to wait ten years ? You and Judith never took a chance , did you ? You waited to be secure  --  how can you tell you 're alive ? I 'm not going to wither and hope while I 'm making up my mind marriage is prudent . " " Passionate , huh ? " Emery inquired . " Youth 's a fever in your veins ? " " Anyway , it is n't ten years of patient yearning . " " Not strong enough to put you to work though . Judith can make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm getting out of here , parson , " Roger said violently . " I 'm leaving Collamore . " Oh , that delusion ! " Too bad the stands ca n't give you a wah-hoo-wah to start you on your way . " Emery scrutinized him . " Going on the bum ? Or has something scared you ? " But Roger went swiftly out of the great room . Judith , coming down the famous curving stairs , stood aside to let him pass her headlong . She was wearing one of the blue-and-white smock-like garments that showed the subtlety of her figure . Economy of bone and flesh , stripped to the necessities of design , she was superbly New Hampshire ? the product of a century and a half of survival . Emery 's nerves jumped , for though her face was calm , the serene replica of many faces that looked out of portraits in the Bulfinch house , her eyes were deeply shadowed . He had not known Judith Hardinge all her life without being able to recognize distress when he saw it  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She gave him her hand and color stirred in her cheeks . Her eyes requested him to make no warmer recognition of the day . ' ' I heard you being a guardian . You failed to observe your own caution about the well-bred voice . He did n't say where he 's been ? " " The Hardinges , " Emery said , " are a proud county family . " " It seems not to have occurred to him that I also can feel humiliation at not being able to send him to Tech . . . . You 'll look at my loom ? It has been feeding unevenly . " She halted for a glance at the portrait of the Hon. Jabez Hardinge , builder of the Bulfinch house , with a shaft of sun now striking his forehead . " Roger has that forehead , " she said , " and the nose of the Honorable Jabez . The resemblance stops short right there . Oh , quite short . " Light reflected from the portrait warmed her face . She said , with complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ museum . The Hardinges are an extinct family . I hope they call this the Mayo house , if ever . . . " Her voice died . " Whoever lives in it will always be pensioners of Charles Bulfinch . In a way the Hardinges are just interlopers , Judith , just an incident . No Mayos ever lived in any of the seven houses , but two generations of them had died in Collamore when the Honorable Jabez came up from Portsmouth to open his pineries  --  and I 'm living on their land . The Mayos are good yeoman stock , out of the granite . Makes a good cross for the thinning gentry . " " It would , if the cross ever occurred . . . . It 's happened , Emery , " she stated rather than said , " I 'm thirty this morning . I lay awake last night as a girl might before her wedding day . It'sno longer possible to be just the oldest Hardinge girl . I 'm a decayed gentlewoman  --  a New England spinster . " He saw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had been broken up dispassionately . Her eyes had been disciplined to shrink from nothing they must look at . So she was looking at herself in a new light , but no rebellion could possibly follow the discovery . " I 'm thirty-seven , " he said soberly . " Yankee mechanic with clever hands . This is Collamore , Judith , not the happy islands . We do what we have to do . " Her forehead was tranquil under the straight part in her hair . " Next month Lydia will have a third baby to call me Aunt Judith . Then I 'll soon be the aunt of Polly 's children . The New England spinster is the best type of aunt . . . . No doubt you 've left some grouse in the kitchen . For how many years have you brought me grouse on the first day of the shooting season , and acquiesced with perfect taste when one further obligation kept me unmarried in this house ? " Her father had died when she was seventeen , her mother when she was nineteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ There had been three children to bring through adolescence and education into marriage and maturity . There had been the Bulfinch house and the three farms to manage and preserve . The Hardinge inheritance to be watched . Everything except to yield to the summons of her own fulfillment . " We had a job to do , " he said morosely . Only in the granitelike acceptance of necessity did Judith Hardinge , walking across the yard with him , differ from that girl of nineteen . Her quiet bitterness meant acquiescence , resignation to the lost years . In that subtle body was latent a sensed capacity for revolt , for passionate overturn , like the charged loveliness of autumn in the hills . if he had been able to reach that in her , the eleven years would have been a different story . He had n't , and so , though rebellion might exist , it would not break out . Judith had accepted this new necessity of seeing Roger through . Emery Mayo would , as always , accept it too . Elm leaves fled before @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sweet , orderly , heaped with harvest . Here , as in Polly 's kitchen , one saw a deeply wrought passion for neatness , for soundness . A one-time woodshed held Judith 's loom . Starting it , Emery watched the shuttle for a moment , diagnosed the ailment , knelt , and let his fingers work expertly in the gears . He nodded to Judith , who fed woof through it , smiled , and shut off the power . Light lay on whitewashed walls . A frame held a pattern in lavender and white  --  one of the exquisite curtains or bedspreads which sold exorbitantly to tourists who came to stare at the Mall . Her weaving meant the same passion , the heritage of New Hampshire . As rents failed and dividends were passed , she had turned to what she found at hand . " How many times were we going to be married  --  after something ? " she asked suddenly . " After the children were grown . After Roger had finished Dartmouth . After Polly was married . So Lydia came home . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ broke and having a baby . " " No one could foresee how many obstacles Roger could be . It seems quite natural to him to hold us off once more till the world makes the place he wants . I do n't know what he 's doing , Emery . I do know he 's furtive and ugly and terrified by something . " " He 's twenty-three  --  old enough to know what he 's doing . Got to expect him to be ugly , a little . The boywanted to be an engineer and he wants to get married . " " Can you remember when we did too ? " she asked with quiet bitterness . " I see Polly 's bread-mixer in your pocket  --  you 've made my loom work perfectly  --  you 've always been clever with your hands . Perhaps you could arrange the world more agreeably if you were cleverer with other people 's lives . " That was a final judgment ; she accepted it , she would n't oppose it . She began to change the frame and , as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up its regular thudding . They were both like that and had always been  --  well disciplined , willing to accept necessity . All necessity , he thought , except their own . They were warmed by a fire that had smoldered for eleven years without ever breaking into flame . Philip Storrs was sitting on the front steps , drawing details of the cornice on a pad of paper . He had discovered a new America in the seven houses of Collamore , had been led from them to other New Hampshire houses , was preparing a book . That was adaptability , it was meeting the unforeseen with new weapons . Emery looked at the drawing . Strength and stability wrought in white pine , it had the secret of New Hampshire , of the Hardinges . " Selectmen 's meeting last night , Phil , " he said . " Town 's saved up thirty-five hundred dollars out of school funds to do remodeling here and in East Collamore . Five per cent , hundred and seventy-five , for architectural supervision . Will you do it ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a gold lacquer on the MalI , with Harry Marsh , the hired man , raking leaves in slow time . Children were shouting in the yard before the rose-brick schoolhouse . " I 'm a third-rate architect , " Phil said , " and I made thirty thousand dol-lars in 1928 . If I 'd been fifth-rate or even first-rate , I could have quadrupled it . Last year I did n't even have an office . So I came to stay with my wife 's folks . . . Unless this is a Yankee subterfuge for getting money into my pocket , you know I 'll do it . At least Judith wo n't have to pay Lydia 's doctor bill . " " Wo n't be any . With his boy marrying Polly , Doc Fanning will practically be the kid 's grandfather ... . You 're feeling  --  relieved  --  Phil ? " The architect nodded . - One 's nerve seems to come back , in Collamore . Mine was kicked out of me , facing a third child . Does nothing scare this town ? Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? You take your leisure shooting grouse ; the selectmen save money to spend on schools ; Dr. Fanning delivers babies in the Bulfinch house in its second century  --  do n't you understand you should be paralyzed with terror ? " Emery permitted himself the rural ' nasality of Ira Peavey . " Pineries closed down in 1837 when the hills got logged off , and the town 's had hard times ever since . But we 've lived through the end of the world five or six times in that century , and Polly still fills her pantry . Must have some kind of toughness . . . Be good painting weather for a spell now , Phil . You might get out some white lead and touch up that cornice . " " White lead , a full pantry , and wait it out ! " Philip laughed . " That 's the local religion . It 's a good one , but a little hard on the oldest daughter . . ? . You 've never had the toughness to take what you wanted and let the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , aged eight , kicked one of Roger 's footballs round the corner of the house , in the direction of the school . Then Roger was in the doorway intently watching that progress . Young Philip reached the corner of the Mall , crossed the road in white gold light , and ran whooping into the yard . " ' Constructed from plans drawn by Charles Bulfinch , ' " Roger quoted . " Or , the descendants of the Honorable Jabez being now on the town , shall we move on to number 2 ? ' The next house appears at first sight to be a replica of the Bulfinch house , but was built by some anonymous carpenter who successfully altered the proportions . . . " His voice died in clean air . Philip let his pencil sketch a bevel in the entablature . Emery 's gaze rested on Roger , who flushed and studied the road . A red roadster shot up 112 at about seventy . Phil Storrs swore and stared at the schoolyard to make sure that his son was safely across the road @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just luck . The doorway was empty . Roger had slipped away into the house . A bell began to clatter in the cupola on top of the school . " Nine o'clock , " Phil said . " Does n't your conscience throb , losing a full hour ? But then you 're the queerest garageman in America . Lawyer , were n't you , be-fore you turned philosopher ? " Emery 's gaze lingered on 112 . " Just a law clerk in Boston . No good at it . But I was clever with my hands  --  I was a Yankee mechanic . So I came home . " Oscar Garceau was coming up 112 . The Garccau possessions and the Garceau family were contained in as curious a vehicle as had ever traveled that historic highway . An old wagon box was bolted to the chassis of an old automobile , and the return of the defeated to Quebec was accomplished on pneumatic tires behind a scrawny horse . Emery and Philip started forward , and Judith came round the house , summoning Harry Marsh to bring @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ front steps , her arms heaped with loaves of newly baked bread . She gave them to one of the children , and Oscar effervesced with praise . Hands in his pockets , saying nothing , Emery watched Harry Marsh lift in a large box filled with Polly 's products and the surplus of the Bulfinch house . Gesticulating , ragged , improbably mustached , Oscar invoked blessings on the ' Ardinges . " You 've told your brother-in-law you 're coming home , Oscar ? " Judith asked . " She 's got beeg house , " Oscar said cheerfully . " Quebec people ' ave beeg ' eart  --  will be always room . So good-by , Mees ' Ardinge . I ' ave douleur that we ' ave not made better with your land . Too bad , dose ' ard times . " For four or five days and nights , making northward , they would pleasantly picnic on Judith 's provisions . Then they would drive shouting into a Quebec farmyard and a less waxlike brother-in-law would assume Oscar 's responsibilities . Hard times ? In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's invincible shiftlessness would have come to the same end  --  three years ' rent unpaid and Judith 's charity while Oscar praised beeg ' carts . Whatever small flare of energy had brought him southward had been too small . And Judith 's farm was idle , unprotected from the hills . " You go get some douleur that your kids have n't got drawers , Oscar , " Emery said . " If your brother-in-law 's heart is as tough as you say it 's big , you 'll be working on the roads next week . " Mrs. Garceau broke into ecstatic Canadian French which invoked miscellaneous blessings on Mademoiselle ' Ardinge and dissolved into pleasant grief . Various children joined the lamentation , then Oscar climbed to the sagging seat , and all of them werehappy again . They shouted " au ' voir " in several keys , Oscar stirred the horse to action , and the equipage rolled off up 112 . The shadows of elm branches moved across children , bedding , and chairs , and the defeated were black shapes against slanting gold @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ folks . an instinct , " Phil Storrs said . He walked swiftly away . Judith watched him , her eyes compassionate . Emery said , " I did n't go through the wagon . I thought the chatelaine of the Bulfinch house would n't call it charitable to search for whatever Oscar has stolen from your farm . It will be everything he could unbolt and get into the wagon . " He was vividly seeing the frowsiness of acres that should be neat and opulent . Year by year Oscar had let the place yield to decay . The fields would be ragged and scrawny , the barns would be out of plumb , no white paint would keep the house self-respecting. in Emery 's mind the fallen , vine-rotted roof at the Perkins place ached like an old wound . Whence would come the obstinate labor that alone could keep Judith 's acres from the hills ? " You have n't much mercy for them when they give up , Emery , " she said . " When everybody is helpless , what does a little theft matter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ testified that the yielding quality was inappropriate to this granite . " Oscar never belonged here , " he said . " The farm or the Bulfinch house  --  just where is the difference ? There are so many people under my roof who have reached the end . " She had her new finality . Autumn breeze wrapped the blue-and-white garment closely round her -- -her body had endurance , stability , strength that had no passion . She was granite and unwarmed . She held her head high hut , looking at Oscar Garceau , she saw Judith Hardinge . " Go back to your loom ! " he said roughly . He had spoken more vehemently than in all the lifetime he had known her . She walked down the drive through clear sunlight , leaves scudding before her on the west wind that pressed the dress against her thighs and breast . Obedient to her obligations , but unmarried , unfulfilled ! Emery walked rapidly at an angle across the Mall . He bawled " Roger ! " with that surprising roughness and , again , " Roger ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Come down here ! " Emery shouted . Surprise and resentment showed in Roger 's face , but Emery roared again , " Get down here a-hellin ' . I want to talk to you , " and sheer vigor of command produced obedience . Roger came through the door . " What the ? " " Come on over to the garage . " Roger drew back and , involuntarily , his glance swept the visible stretch of the highway north and south . Emery seized his arm . " Scared , are you ? " " I 'm not scared , " Roger said angrily . He shook off Emery 's hand . At the garage Emery unlocked the big doors , took the chains off the pumps , set out the oil rack , and started the air-compressor . He unlaced his boots and went to a closet to put on a suit of grease-impregnated overalls . He tossed a similar suit at Roger . " I 'll give you four dollars a day while the work lasts this fall , " he said curtly . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ first thing she needs is a carbon job . You can make a start on the valves . " Roger folded the overalls and laid them on a bench . " You do n't think I will , do you ? " " Rog , the sooner you get it through your thick head that you 're not going to gallop down the field to cheers everagain , the better for all of us . After you 've mastered that idea you can begin to think how a Varsity left end looks wearin ' clothes his sister paid for by working at a loom . " " Is it my fault ? " Roger asked , too loudly . " If you think I like living in the Bulfinch house , loafing , while Judith makes bedspreads for fat women in limousines , you 're dumber than I thought . But did I invent a nation that ca n't produce a job for me ? " " Trouble with you , Roger , you 're not intelligent , " Emery said impersonally . " An hour ago it was God , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We 're all sorry Judith could n't send you to Tech and make you an engineer ? that would have been lots prettier than muckin ' grease in a garage . But let Oscar Garceau blame things on God . Four dollars a day is n't Iookin ' picturesque buildin ' Boulder Dam , but it 's a job . And , in Collamore , you can support Jessie on it . Before you wither away from hope . " " Oh , stop being bucolic ! " Roger shouted . " You do n't have to chew a straw and spit to show me you 're a wise guy . " He jerked a wallet from his pocket and drew a sheaf of hills from it , large bills . " I do n't need to muck grease for four dollars a day . I can take care of Jessie  --  and not in Collamore either . " Emery sat on a bench . " Not intelligent . Not even with a Dartmouth degree and being named all-American by the Dartmouth paper . . . . I was kidding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dollars a year to work here . You are n't clever with your hands . All I wanted was to see your money , and now I 've seen it . " He stood up , all the morning 's anger in his voice . " So make up your mind to it , Roger . You ca n't be an engineer but there 's the Garceau place to farm . You can start cleaning it up to  --  day . " The boy 's face became mere contempt . " If I wo n't clean up grease for you , is it likely I 'll turn farmer ? " " You adolescent jackass , " Emery said dispassionately , " being intelligent is just learning to do the thing at hand . Nobody on a farm in Collamore is scared this fall . " " Do I seem scared ? " " Quite a lot . Well , I would n't force anything on you  --  it 's your choice . There 's the Garceau place and it needs a lot of work . And down at Concord there 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ No use working on that truck up at the Perkins place  --  she wo n't start for you . " Here Roger Hardinge went quickly through the door . Emery 's voice followed him . " Your boss ought to be calling on you pretty soon , Roger  --  four thousand dollars ' worth of goods to be accounted for . " The full extent of the crisis at the Bulfinch house was now acknowledged . The atmosphere of this remote hill town was not accommodated to crisis -- -it was a place for the orderly , slow procession of life and death . The pride of this race was firmly married to righteousness  --  how was he to tell Judith that her brother had been driving a liquor truck ? He began to work on Hen Fuller 's engine . His mind burned with a complex anger  --  anger at Judith 's resignation , anger at Roger 's stupid folly . All this was disorder , a violation of neatness . Abandoning his wrenches , he went out into that calm sunlight . A great dignity , the Mall in scarlet and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This dignity , this security , had endured because it had never compromised with disorder . He went up the swept drive of the Bulfinch house and crossed to the white barns . Judith sat on her stool , intent on the growth of line in pale lavender . At sight of him she shut off the power , and noise ended while her eyes phrased an inquiry . He went straight to the point . The reason Roger has been disappearing the last two months is , he 's been driving a liquor truck for a combine up at Magog . Probably you have n't heard about it  --  the villagers call it the redheaded Jew 's outfit . They brought some through last night and somebody waylaid them . There was some shooting . Roger took his load up to the old Perkins place and left it there . That 's why he 's scared . " " I see . Bootlegging . " " No . Rum running . " Why did n't she flame ? The part in her chestnut hair was exact ; her eyes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He saw doubt become bitter certainty in them , but she would give disaster no expression . Suddenly this discipline seemed to him a barren thing . Submission could be poison . Only by yielding to violence could she break free ; only violence could save her  --  or him . There would be none . They were n't violent people . That was their defeat . She said with an effect of meditation , " I 'm having a distinguished birthday . I heard the shooting . I was lying awake thinking of the decline of the Hardinges . I was pretty morbid but not morbid enough to suppose that the shooting could be part of the decline . I could n't possibly have imagined rum running . He 'll have to go away . " Fury was making Emery 's throat tight . " He 's got that idea too . I wo n't let him go away . I 've got a use for him . " " He 'll go away . There are some things that even a Yankee mechanic ca n't patch together and solder @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Your house is a hundred and twenty-three years old  --  be queer if it had n't held some pretty curious Hardinges in its time . Roger stays here . " Wrath broke out of his control . " He had spunk enough to take steps to get married . You would n't lie awake seeing honors if you had n't slept alone too long . " Beyond precedent , he gripped her arm . " You and I accepted our obligations ; we submitted to the inevitable like well-bred disciplined people . Well-bred , hell ! ? in a garage and at a loom . It 's time to wonder if there 's any difference between discipline and anemia . Good blood can have a lot of water in it . Stay and make bedspreads . I 'll manage Roger . " He stormed out of the shed and his eyes held the dazzle of sunlight . He had a sense of triumphant reassertion . Elm branches moved in the brightness , and he started to confront Roger , but a horn began to sound stridently at the garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made him respond . But his mind still seethed and not till he had crossed the Mall did he realize that he had already seen the red roadster twice this morning . Confusion died at once . No mistake was possible . Four thousand dollars ' worth of liquor was now to be accounted for . Emery went forward warily . It was an Italian behind the wheel and , watchful at his side , the redheaded Jew was unmistakable . Small chunky men , both of them , swarthy and pig-eyed , incongruous in these hills . " Fill her up , Jack , " the Jew said . " Then listen to the engine . She do n't sound so good . " His small eyes roved , taking in the Mall , the roadside , the available data . " How would you kill time in this town ? " They were soft-spoken , steellike , and very dangerous . But  --  they were n't clever , for the tank would not hold three gallons more . Emery let his eyes drowse and brought the rustic drawl of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Collamore Inn . Or Doc Whipple 's pharmacy 's got a nice choice of post cards . " " Watch it , Pete . buy a post cardfrom Doc . " The Jew got out of the roadster and , his shoulders hunched , strode down the sidewalk . Long-armed , hands half open , like a chimpanzee . Sun and shade moved on that pinched-in coat ; underneath it , on hip or under shoulder , would be a gun . Pete too , alert behind the wheel , would have one , but the floor of the car would hold no further armament , since they had invited him to work on the engine . Rapidity was everything . " Start her up , " Emery directed . His voice was peremptory , and Pete 's eyes narrowed under a creased forehead . " Want me to look at the engine , do n't you ? " The starter whirred . Emery listened to the effortless rhythm of eight cylinders firing perfectly . No , they were n't clever . At the very least , they should have unscrewed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the hicks they might encounter in such a town . " What would you say was wrong ? " Emery inquired conversationally . " I drive ' em , Jack , " Pete said , his gaze fixed on the Jew 's progress . " I do n't mend ' em . She just sounds bad . Do your stuff . " The Jew was scanning the stores . He went into Doc Whipple 's pharmacy and the sunlight was empty of menace . Work fast ! " She sounds pretty bad . " Emery straightened up . " Got to get some tools . " He turned his back on Pete to cross the road toward the Mall . He beard Pete say , " What the hell ? " and get out of the roadster . His scalp prickled but he sauntered through sun and shadow to the lawn , not looking back . At the same slow pace he came to the front door and went inside . Out of sight , he hurried through till he saw Phil Storrs . " Go out the back way , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ telephone office and have Gladys locate Ira Peavey . Get him up here on the run with any of his buddies . Wait for them and bring them over here . " Inquiry in Phil 's face faded before urgency . Phil wasintelligentl He went without a word . The regular thudding of the loom told him where Judith was , and Polly moved in the kitchen . Emery went upstairs and down the hall to Roger 's room . Roger scowled at him , swinging round from the bed on which a rucksack stood half-filled . Emery saw thick socks , underwear , a toilet-kit . In spite of rising tension , Emery had space to despise the instinct of flight . " Getting out , huh ? You and Gat ceau ? licked and scared out . You ca n't stand the gaff . Well , you 're not going , Roger . You 'd stay here and work it out if I had to thrash you every morning like a sulky kid at school . . . . Too late , anyway . Your boss is over at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Roger straightened slowly . He had n't really expected them to come ! No foresight . Rebelliousness that was just blind , that did not see its way , was mere folly . Emery nodded . " They 'll be here any minute . You 'd better figure out what you 've got to say . This is no maybe , son  --  it 's a must . " Even as he spoke , Polly 's exclamation of surprise and fright at the front door drifted upstairs . " There they are , " Emery said . " You asked for it and here it is . We 'll go down and talk to them . " He let Roger precede him down the hall . But nothing could be done . Pete stood with his back to the closed door and had the stairway covered . The Jew could command the lower ball ; he had blocked Polly off in a corner . She stared at them , trembling . " Yeah ! " As they reached the bottom step the Jew nodded . " And Jack too . That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shrugged at the great room . " You too , sister . " They had cold precision . Their trade was a constant readiness for the unanticipated . And in the room thatmarked the high tide of the Hardinges , their mechanical alertness , their reptilian efficiency , was a riotous intolerable discord . Pete leaned in the doorway and his hands had not come out of the pockets that a nifty tailor had cut at an angle in the nifty coat . The Jew 's hands too were in his pockets . Among these exquisite chairs , against the white , carved distinction of the woodwork , they were a violation , a rape of more than a century 's decency in this house . Jabez Hardinge had built for a stability , an order , that could not be aware of such a threat . Nothing to do but wait it out . Emery 's eyes half closed  --  look as stupid as possible , be Jack the yokel while time moved . If they could be kept here nothing precipitated , while delay co-operated with Phil Storrs ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were not intelligent . " Siddown . " The Jew spoke quietly ; his trade saw no profit in violence that was not called for . The delicate chair he sat on seemed violated by the alien contact . His small eyes fixed on Roger . " So what ? " " Do n't talk no more'n you need to , " Emery said in his most bucolic drawl . But it was possible to be a little pleased with Roger 's behavior for , ignoring Emery , his face pale but stubborn , he said , " Your stuff is safe . When they jumped you I did n't wait around . I could have crawled off through the brush . I did n't . I drove the truck up in the hills and hid it . It 's still there . " Nothing happened in the tempered sunlight of this white-and-gold room , no one moved , nothing crossed the shadows of exquisite mahogany ; but intangibly menace receded . Pete 's hands were still in his pockets and his unwinking eyes did not alter their ob servation , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and incredulous  --  but something was appeased . " That 's hat 's nice , " the Jew 's cold voice said thinly . " So you can take a walk with Pete and see if it 's so . i ' 11 make friends with Jack and sister here . Then if Pete says it 's O.K. , we 'll let you drive to Boston after dark . " " I 'll show you where it is . " Roger stood up . " Then I 'm through . I 'm not running any more liquor . I 'm not driving to Boston . " Emery 's muscles tightened and menace came back to this white room . No intelligence ! Roger could not know about Phil Storrs 's errand , but even so he should have recognized that the moment called for temporizing . The Jew moved one shoulder only . " Yeah , you 're driving to Boston , " he said . A clear space . Pete in the doorway , hawk-eyed . The Jew on that fragile chair at the opposite wall . Roger twenty feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Polly nerveless by the mantel . . . I 'm not intelligent , Emery thought with sudden fierce contempt . Knew they were coming . Had all morning to get ready . Did I do anything ? Did I do anything but waste time complaining about Judith ? Have I even got a gun ? Did I even tell Ira Peavey to be round ? " I saved your liquor for you . " Roger was flushed and defiant . " That 's enough . Go get it and the hell with you . " " Yeah ? " The syllable was soft and skeptical , and without haste the Jew was on his feet . The thing was precipitated before its proper time  --  the moment was here and Phil Storrs with Ira Peavey did not exist . Roger was at the apex of a triangle , the Jew and Pete able to command the room from either side , and clear space all about them . Polly screamed . Emery 's legs tensed . It might be he could take one of them out , it might be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leaped six feet into the room . Judith was in the doorway , Emery 's shotgun held at the level of her waist , the stock pressed against her hip , her finger on the trigger of the right-hand barrel . " Do n't move , please , either of you , " Judith said . She had startled them into immobility , and she stood for a small moment between the white columns , under the entablature which Charles Bulfinch had created to signify the security of her race , which neither violence nor vulgarity could disturb . Her eyes burned . So she moved forward a little and said , " Perhaps you 'll take this , Emery . " He had come out of his chair . Carefully leaving her foreground clear , he skirted furniture to come up beside her and take the gun . With it once in his hands he gave his anger rein . " Over in the corner , " he urged the two of them with a curt gesture of the barrels . In a kind of catalepsy they obeyed , their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he ordered Roger , and the boy flung himself at them , jerking two automatics from their clothes , and stood free . " Sit downl " Emery commanded them . But Judith said sharply , " Nol They ca n't sit here , " and he saw her point . Even their presence amidst this mahogany and brocade , this chastity of white and blue , was a profanation . They defiled the Bulfinch house , and its mistress would not tolerate the sacrilege . " Stand up then , " he said . Tension died out in him . " Stand up and wait . " So silence possessed the great room , silence and sunlight intensified with noon . Roger seemed to have forgotten the very presence of the captives ; hands in his pockets , he leaned against the white mantel of Charles Bulfinch , stared at the floor , and brooded . Polly was altogether incredulous , staring at them . But Judith sat upright in her chair , and loathing made her cheeks flame . She had destroyed a threat . She had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in subjection . There had been a good many invasions in two centuries , there would he more ; but the race maintained its dominance . Fanaticism of white paint , righteousness of the neat and cared-for thing  --  the rum runner was an untidiness , a soilure , and would be destroyed . She used what she found at handl His soul at peace , Emery resolved never to inform her that when he left a shotgun in a kitchen it was never loaded . Aloofly he approved their economy of speech . They said nothing but only scowled murderously and watched his gun . He repaid them with silence while the shadow of a window frame moved a little farther across the carpet , till motorcycles roared beyond the windows and then stopped . With that arrival disdain overcame Emery Mayo . " No forethought , " he said . " Too sure of yourself in a place you did n't know anything about . Did n't bother to find out it was the first day of grouse season . So you come into a house you 've never @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see who 's in it , and a woman comes in and sticks you up with a shotgun . You poor dumb boobs , " Emery said , contemptuous of stupidity , " you 'd never have got that liquor out of town . " Ira Peavey , with another highway policeman and Philip Storrs came surprised and intent through that white doorway . Emery nodded to them . " You get to be a corporal , Iry , out of sheer merit . You 've made a capture of two notorious rum runners engaged in their occupation . They 've been drawed to your attention . " He took the rotor arm from his pocket and handed it to Ira . " Red roadster at the garage . Then go up to the Perkins place and you 'll find about four thou-sand dollars ' worth of liquor in a truck . Ought to make a deep impression on your captain . " When they had finally gone , after clamor and excitement , Roger said desperately , " So where are we ? You manage things , do n't you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and make wisecracks . Why did n't you let them go ? Do you suppose they 'll take this without getting me into it ? " " I thought of that , " Emery said . " Thought of it even this morning when I found your truck . I might have worked it out if you 'd known how to use your head . Well , you 'll take what you have to , son , whatever it turns out to be . But Ira lives here . Hell take care ? " Judith came out of her chair . " You 'll be taken care of , Roger . That 's your gift , your quality  --  people take care of you . " Scorn was a strong acid in her voice . And  --  it was a new one . She stood poised , her lip drawn hack to form more speech , and Emery knew what it would be . The morning had wrought upon that discipline and somehow , deeply , unpredictably , beyond analysis , that sensed rebellion had broken free . It had begun @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knew what she was going to say . She said it . " But you 're getting out of my house . You bring  --  them  --  into it . " Her glance moved across the purity of line and color , of carved paneling that embodied the fundamentals of strength and order . She would dispose of Roger as she would scour a soiled panel . He had created uncleanness , mere dirtiness , and so he would be expunged . " There is no room for you , " she said . " Emery is coming to live here . " It was said . Fatality was announced ; the thing was achieved . Emery nodded . " You 've made your point , Judith . No need to underline it . " Her body moved a little under that blue-and-white garment . " In a way , he 's made his point , too . He 's got his latch-keyhe can speak in town meeting . " Emery turned squarely toward him . " You do n't want to argue any more , Rog ? You 've got @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Take off those pretty hiking clothes and put on some overalls . After dinner you can make a start on Garceau 's place  --  get it fit to move into . " Upstairs , Lydia was stirring . That situation , Emery realized , required further attention . It would get it itwould be worked out ; it would be solved with the means at hand . . . For the first time in his knowledge of her Judith 's eyes were free . Sun warmed the hollow of her throat . So he would move into the Bulfinch house . And , with Roger at the Garceau place , the hills would be opposed . The Garceau house , the Bulfinch house  --  time did n't matter much , only the phase changed , only the arrangement . They would be taken care of , kept up , kept decent and secure . It had been and it remained a secure , a tenacious race .
