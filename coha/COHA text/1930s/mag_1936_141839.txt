Sailing from Manhattan last week for a vacation in Ireland , James Aloysius Farley risked his shining reputation as a prophet with a new prediction . The man who was right about Election solemnly declared : " It is my firm belief that the country will soon have the most prosperous time in all its history . . . . This Christmas will be the best and most prosperous in the history of the nation . I am sure that we will see people spending more money than in any previous Administration . " <P> Even discounting Mr. Farley 's native optimism , the prospects of big Christmas spendings were rosy indeed . Aside from the continuing upward drive of Recovery , there are two good reasons for this rosiness , for both of which Mr. Farley could claim Democratic credit . One is the rising tide of extra dividend declarations , the other the nation-wide movement to raise wages , pay bonuses . <P> So stiff are the new taxes on undistributed corporate earnings ( up to 27% ) that managements are trying to get substantially all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , when the tax-year for most corporations also ends . Whatever the ultimate effect of this policy may be on corporate finance , the effect on the spendable national income is plain . Total distributions to stockholders in the last three months of this year directly traceable to the tax law , the New York Journal of Commerce estimated last week , will be $500,000,000 . <P> The tide of extra dividends continued to rise last week . Chrysler Corp . voted a $5.50 payment , bringing its dividend total for the year to $12 per share . Gulf Oil Corp . proposed to split its stock two for one , added a 50 payment to the regular 25 quarterly . Eastman Kodak ordered an extra of 75 per share , Columbian Carbon $1.25 , Jewel Tea $2 . In some cases the tax law has prompted resumption of dividends , Western Maryland Ry. last week voting the first payment ( $7 ) on its first preferred since it was reorganized in 1917 and Libby , McNeill &; Libby the first common dividend ( $1 ) since 1921 . <P> Another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reach of the tax collector is to pay bonuses to workers . As a matter of practical industrial relations it is almost imperative to give employes something extra when they know that stockholders are being showered . Bonuses , ranging from the $10,000,000 appropriated by General Motors last fortnight to common Christmas presents planned in hundreds of little businesses , have a greater vogue this year than ever before . <P> How much of this generosity was inspired by the Roosevelt landslide was impossible to determine . Certainly the rush to raise wages that developed in industry after Nov. 3 looked suspiciously like a hasty effort to climb aboard the band wagon of a President who is deeply indebted to Labor . Only big industry to get aboard ahead of time was Packing , which upped its scales 7% one week before Election . Steel hopped on as soon as returns were in . Wage boosts followed in the textile and automobile industries , in hundreds of miscellaneous manufacturing enterprises throughout the land . By last week United Press estimated that at least 1,000,000 U. S. workers had received pay increases @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ .
