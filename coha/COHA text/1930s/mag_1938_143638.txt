Like the wars in China and Spain , those between the New Deal and U. S. utilities are no less real for being undeclared . Last the Supreme Court took two of conflicts in hand . <P> Surprise . Few practices arouse more bitterness among utility men than that of Federal money to build municipal plants which compete with private companies . When the PWA made a loan and grant to establish public plants in four small northern Alabama communities , the constitutionality of the project was promptly attacked by Commonwealth &; Southern 's subsidiary Alabama Power Co . A similar action was brought by Duke Power Co. against Greenwood County , S. C. , which obtained a PWA loan and grant for construction of the Buzzard Roost hydro-electric project on the Saluda River . Both companies charged that PWA Administrator Harold L. Ickes was in effect using his program as a " club " to drive down private rates . Denied injunctions , company attorneys brought both cases to the Supreme Court . <P> When government attorneys last week heard a bewhiskered conservative , Justice George Sutherland @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ case , they shuddered . As he continued to read what turned out to be not a majority but a unanimous decision , they could scarcely believe their ears , for it completely upset the companies ' contentions . <P> " While the loan might frustrate complainant 's hopes of a profitable investment , " droned Justice Sutherland , " it would not violate any legal right . . . . Each of the municipalities in question has authority to construct its proposed plant and distribution system in competition with petitioner , and to borrow money , issue bonds and receive grants for that purpose . " The Court further announced that it would dispose of the Duke Case on similar grounds . <P> Said Secretary Ickes : " The people won . " <P> Said Commonwealth &; Southern 's Wendell L. Willkie : " It means that the Federal Administration can continue its present policy of making outright gifts to municipalities with which to duplicate the distribution system of existing utilities . Of course no utility company can successfully compete with a municipal plant built with free money . . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not contest the right of the Government to fix their rates , they argue lustily about the method used to value their properties for rate-making purposes . Instead of reproduction cost the New Deal would like to have valuations based on what the properties would have cost under a policy of ' ' prudent investment . " For obvious reasons the utilities as a rule favor the former , upheld in a series of Supreme Court decisions since 1898 . For reasons equally obvious the New Deal has been trying to get the utilities , either through persuasion or compulsion , to accept the theory of " prudent investment .. "
