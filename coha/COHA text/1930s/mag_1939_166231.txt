Hull 's Hunch <P> Sirs : The march of , German troops into Poland recently was undoubtedly of little surprise to Secretary of State Cordell Hull . The reason : In TIME , July 17 , p. 19 , he is quoted as having privately made the following statement to Congressmen . " Hitler will march in September-unless we pass this legislation " ( repeal of the arms embargo ) . Prognosticator Hull deserves praise and acclaim for being so farsighted and foretelling this momentous event . <P> BERNARD ROSENBAUM Detroit , Mich . <P> Holton Plan <P> Sirs : <P> The letter of Mr. E.
