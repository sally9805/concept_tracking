txt The largest amount in bank deposits of any public official  --  yet disclosed was revealed yesterday by Samuel Seabury , counsel of the Hofstadter legislative committee , in his examination of Under Sheriff Peter J. Curran at a public hearing in the County Court House . Mr. Curran , who is president of the Democratic club of Sheriff Thomas M. Farley , Tammany leader of the Fourteenth Assembly District , was shown to have deposited $662,311.11 in six years and . three-quarters . This amount topped the deposits of Sheriff Farley , his chief , who obtained most of his money from his " wonderful boxes , " by approximately $300,000 and those of Register James A. of Brooklyn , previous holder of the high record , by $150,000 . Mr. Curran , who has been one of Sheriff Farley 's leading supporters since the latter became active in politics eleven years ago , said he obtained part of his money from business , the proceeds of a horse livery stable which he sold out in 1927 , the profits of a partnership in an undertaking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Farley Association for $25,000 he had paid for the purchase and repair of its clubhouse at 369 East Sixty-second Street . The under-sheriff declined to be specific concerning the amounts of money he obtained from his business enterprises , except as to the garage , frt i which he said he obtained a rent of from $10,000 to $12,000 a year . He explained that for years he had been in the habit of cashing checks for any one he knew in the neighborhood and that this practice of taking money out to cash checks and then putting it in again probably acvaunted for a large part of his deposits . and Whalen Testify . Two former Police Commissioners , George V. and Grover A. Whalen , absolved Mayor Walker from interfering with gambling raids on political clubs . " If non-Interference is cooperation , " Mr. said in reply to a question by Mr .. Seabury , " I received 100 per cent cooperation from the Mayor . " Mr. Whalen , nattily attired in a gray suit and a blue necktie but without the customary gardenia @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ acted entirely on his own Initiative in reducing Deputy Chief Inspector Lewis J. Valentine , who had been in command of a confidential special squad under his predecessors , to the rank of captain and in abolishing the squad two days after he took office . Mr. Whalen declared that the abolition of the squad and the transfer of Captain Valentine to command a precinct in Long Island City was incidental to a general plan of reorganization and that Mayor Walker had never talked to him about Valentine . In Supreme Court Justice Edward J. Glennon denied the application of Minthorne T. Gordon , president of the Tompkins Bus Company of Staten Island , to vacate a subpoena requiring him to appear at a private hearing . Justice Glennon held that there could be no question as to the right of the Legislature to adopt a resolution giving a subcommittee power to sit , take testimony and report , and thereby vacated the temporary injunction restraining a subcommittee from questioning Mr. Gordon . The decision undoubtedly will be appealed . Hearing on Queens Set . Mr. Seabury will begin his investigation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bus Company operates , by the ism- ance of subpoenas today or tomorrow for other witnesses than Mr. Gordon to appear at private hearings . At the Public hearings , which will be resumed next Wednesday , it is probable that he will offer testimony concerning the administration of some of the county offices in Queens , reserving the inquiry into the administration of Borough. - Presi-dent George U. Harvey until later . Curran Ignorant of Raid . Curran testified that he had been appointed Under Sheriff by Charles W. Culkin. former Sheriff , on recommendation of Farley , in September , 1928 . He said he had been president of the Farley club since 1920 , and wee president at the time of the gambling raids in 1926 but knew nothing about them . " I only know what I read in the newspapers , " he said . " No one around the club ever told you that there had been a raid , did they ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " STo , sir , " replied Curran , causing a laugh from the audience . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of the raids helping pack baseball bats , skipping ropes and rubber balls for the club 's outing the next day , but saw no policemen in the ' club while he was there . He asserted that he never saw any gambling of the professional variety in the club and was certain that the $25,000 the club paid him did not come in any part from the proceeds of gambling . Mr. Curran 's bank deposits from Jan. 1 , 1925 to Oct. 9 , 1931 , totaled $662,311.11 , of which $14,936 was in cash and $493,961 of which was listed as unclassified as the deposit slips were not produced . The witness had no recollection that he had told Irving Ben Cooper , Mr. Seabury's. assistant , that the profits from his undertaking business in 1930 were about $6,000 . He refused to fix any amount but , under questioning by Mr. Seabury , admitted that they might have averaged somewhere around $25,000 a year for the six year period . After the death of his partner , George F. Crum , on April 8 , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ firm was deposited in his personal account . Mr. Curran 's deposits in 1929 were $107,600 , and Mr. Sea bevy asked what his profits from his undertaking business were during that year . " I could n't answer that question , " the witness replied . " Do n't you mean , Sheriff , that you wo n't answer that question ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " No , sir , I do n't , " replied the witness . " I mean that I ca n't answer accurately . I do n't know . " . Mr. Curran was equally reluctant to name an amount when asked how much he realized from the sale of his livery stable , in which he said he had at one time 250 horses . He finally agreed that this amount might be around $25,000 . He suggested that collection of bills that had been owed to him might explain some of the deposits . " So that all these sums , $149,526 in 1925 , $105,830 in 1926 and $104,824 in 1927 , and the $25,000 you received from the Farley @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and your own salary ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Right , " said the witness . " So we have got that account straight , have n't we ? " " That is straight now , " Mr. Curran said . " Well , if that is straight now , Sheriff , I think I will leave it alone , leave it right there , " Mr. Seabury said . " 0 . K. , Judge , " said Mr. Curran . " 0 . K. , " Mr. Seabury assented with a smile . Absolves Mayor . Mr. during his testimony absolved Mayor Walker from interfering with raids on political clubs and denied that his resignation as Police Commissioner had been forced . The detailed testimony on these points , started by questioning by Assemblyman Irwin Steingut , follows : Q. ? During the fifteen months or whatever the period was that you were commissioner , did you receive the cooperation of the Mayor 's offlee ? A. ? Absolutely . Q. ? Were you criticized for any of your official acts ? A. ? No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I got 100 per cent cooperation . I never discussed professional gambling with Mayor Walker nor any other official in New York City . Q. ? You were never asked to lay off gambling ? A. ? Absolutely not . By Mr. Seabury  --  Were you ever asked to lay on as to any gambling by the Mayor ? A. ? Judge , I want to be fair on that , I was never asked to emphasize any part of my police duties . Q. ? And you never discussed this gambling situation with the Mayor ? A. ? I never discussed gambling or anything else that had to deal with the performance of my duties with the Mayor , beyond the fact that from time to time I appeared before the Board of Estimate and asked for appropriations for additional men and equipment . Q. ? And when you asked for them , you got them ? A. ? I did . Q. ? And is that what you referred to when you ' said you got 100 per cent cooperation ? A. ? Yes . By Mr. Steingut @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? I had several attractive business offers at that time and I left to make more money , putting it to you frankly . By Mr. Seabury : Q. ? Coming back , Commissioner , for a moment to this confidential squad that you have told us about , was it your experience that that squad worked well , generally speaking ; that it was a good thing or that it was an evil thing and a mistake ? A. ? Oh , no ; that it worked very well and that it was a valuable adjunct to the police organization . Q. ? What would you think of the criticism that it led to demoralization and side-stepping in the department ? Would that be a true criticism ? A. ? Now , I do n't want to get into a controversy with my successor , if he is the one who made that statement , but I can only say that , from my experience while there as Police Commissioner , certainly the confidential squad strengthened the morale rather than demoralized it . Q. ? It did not demoralize it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as far as your observations are concerned , it did n't result in side-stepping of responsibility ? A. ? No . Can I give you a little background on that ? Q. ? Surely . A. ? You have got to bear in mind that there is no group of men that are exposed to the temptations that the members of the Police Department are , and it is necessary to have an investigating body  --  that is no reflection upon the members of the force . In fact , such a squad as that is in a large measure recommended by the members of the force . The percentage of men that go wrong in the Police Department is relatively small . I venture to say that the percentage of policemen that are convicted of crime is smaller thee the percentage of bank ? lts , in spite of the fact that the temptation of the Police Department is far greater . You have a squad there not alone to follow up complaints , but it is like a force in any other banking or business organization . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that you had an auditing . force in an industrial or banking establishment or a stock brokerage firm , you could easily come to the belief that those entrusted with duties might not resist temptation , and particularly under certain circumstances . Now , that is the kind of a constructive squad that I aimed at , and , based upon my observation there , I believe we achieved that result . Tells of Gambling Raids . Mr. told of his campaign to stop professionalgambling In political clubs after injunctions which had protected them from police raids were vacated . He described the attempts to stop gambling in the club of Peter J. , Brooklyn Assistant Commissioner of Public Works , and corroborated testimony that he had sought and obtained the aid of John H. McCooey , Brooklyn Democratic leader . He gave a high character to Captain Valentine and his assistant , Lieutenant Ezekiel E. Keller , both of whom have testified before the committee , and declared that each was efficient and known as " straight " in the department . " Is it your judgment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that professional gamblers could continuously operate within the city limits unless there was acquiescence by the police ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " Yes , the so-called floating game , " Mr. replied . " That is the game that has a different place every night . It is pretty hard for the police to get them : " " But the professional gambler who maintains an establishment in which the game is operated , could he in your judgment operate without the acquiescence of the police ? " " I wo n't say that ? he would need the acquiescence of the police , but he could n't operate without being observed by the police , " Mr. replied . " It may need a period of time to get the evidence they need to stop his operations . " " Where professional gamblers continuously maintain their operations they can be discovered by the police within a reasonable time , can they not ? " Mr. Seabury continued . " Yes , " said Mr. . " And they can be Suppressed ? " " Yes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their place there unless the police failed to suppress them ? " Mr. Seabury asked . " That is right , absolutely , " said Mr. Refuses Suggestions . Mr. Seabury then asked Mr. for constucave suggestions . The witness said : " I want to say I made a resolution when I left the Police Department , that I would refrain from making any statement about the police or crime . I made an observation while there that some of my predecessors insisted upon continuing their interest to the embarrassment of their successors . The Mayor should have the power of appointment . It is his responsibility and he should have the authority . " Mr. Cuvillier added that New York , proportionately to other large cities , such as London , had a small number of ' policemen and said the New York . force should be increased , particularly to give more men for patrol . Questioned as to whether the Police Commissioner should be appointed from civil life or should be a member of the uniformed force , the witness said that would depend @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man in the department ought to he better qualified to carry on the work than a man from outside . He expressed the opinion that the police at present were fairly paid and fairly treated , but suggested that the length of service before retirement should be shortened from twentyfive to twenty years , to conform to the rule in the Fire Department . Whalen Takes Stand . Mr. Whalen said that Mayor Walker had first offered to appoint him Police Commissioner about a month before his appointment on Dec. 18 , 1928 , and that he at first refused because he did not wish to withdraw from business and give up his position with John Wanamaker , of which he now is general manager . He revealed that he had finally consented to accept appointment about two weeks before it was made and declared that the Mayor during this period did not discuss police problems with him but was concerned only with getting him to take the place . At the time of his acceptance , which he believed took place at luncheon at the Hardware Club , Mayor Walker @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I never had a detailed discussion with the Mayor about conditions in the department , " Mr. Whalen testified . " The Mayor 's concern seemed to be entirely with the health of Commissioner Warren , his illness and his desire to have him take a holiday and rest ? so that he would be able to continue his responsibility . He felt that the responsibility was weighing upon his friend and hoped he would be sensible enough to take a holiday so that he might recover from what apparently was a progressing illness . ' " But nothing was said , as I understand it , that this illness of Commissioner Warren had resulted in conditions in the department which were not satisfactory to the Mayor ? " Mr. Seabury. asked . . " All that I . can recall that the Mayor said to meL " replied Mr , Wha . len , " is that he felt that , due to the commissioner 's illness , the department was slipping from his control . " " Was there any special reference that the Mayor made to convey that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was not only the sense but almost tile exact words of the Mayor . " Mr. Whalen said he gave a great deal of thought to the Police Department between the time he agreed to accept the commissionership and the time he took office . " I did give the matter very serious consideration , particularly the organization of the department and the manner in which it was functioning at that time , " he declared . " I looked upon the Police Department as I would upon a corporation : . that I was the executive head of the corporation , and , as such , I would attempt to so fashion the organization in its functional purposes that I would get the most effective result . And in that particular I immediately set about to reorganize the department when I went into the Police Commissionership on the 18th . " Testimony of Whalen . The questioning proceeded as follows : Q. ? Do you mean by that last statement , which , of course , is somewhat general in character , that you wanted the Police Department to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and that political considerations would not be operative ? A. ? Absolutely . Q. ? But you had made no special study of any particular problem with which your precedessor had been required to wrestle ? A. ? No , because I was quite satisfied in my own mind that the problems with which I would have to . deal as Police Commissioner would be problems that would come up through the organization , and I would meet at that time . Q. ? You mean through the police organization ? A. ? Yes . I did not feel that it would be of material assistance for me to review the previous administrations of my predecessors . Well , now , commissioner , before you entered into the office did you have occasion to discuss with anybody the activities of Valentine ? A. ? No . I had occasion to discuss with a police officer the functioning generally of the Police bepartment . I talked to a man in whom I had the greatest confidence and whom I later appointed to a high command in the department , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I also later appointed to a high post , the functioning of the Police Department at that time , and I came to the very definite conclusion that if we were to have any measure of success in my administration of the police it would depend largely upon restoring to the force a confidence in the Police Commissioner and in his belief that the men of the force were honest , if - given an opportunity to prove themselves , and I proceeded along those lines . Talked With Muirooney . Mr. Whalen said the two police officers he talked with were Edward P. Mulrooney , who succeded him as commissioner , and John O'Brien , whom he appointed chief inspector . He added that he also talked with the late Inspector John J. Stapleton about the confidential squad and decided to abolish it . Mr. Whalen insisted that the abolition of the confidential squad was not intended to indicate displeasure at the activities of Valentine or any of those under his command , but was ordered solely because his plan of reorganization called for the return of its functions to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had not talked with Valentine in person before signing the order reducing and transferring him , but said that this was not usual in the department . Subsequently , the witless said , Captain Valentine applied for transfer to the precinct in Brooklyn in which his home is located and he approved the application . He further explained that Captain Valyentine 's reduction in rank had been necessary because he needed a Deputy Chief Inspectorship for his reorganization plan . " There were two other major operations that I performed in the department before I came to Deputy Chief Inspector Valentine 's work , Mr. Whalen said . " I retired the Chief Inspector of the department . I decidedly got the impression immediately upon my appointment that that office was not functioning as it should because there was a superauthority in the department . " Who was this ? " asked Mr. Seabury . " Inspector Valentine 's squad , who superseded in . a great many cases the authority and exercised the authority of the Chief Inspector , " Mr. Whalen replied . ' Was it your purpose @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the gambling situation would not be effective ? " " Not at all , " said Mr. Whalen . " Valentine and Keller meant nothing to me . I handled the situation impersonally . " Queried on Fitzgibbons Case . Mr. Seabury questioned Mr. Whalen at length about his reinstatement of acting Lieutenant Patrick Fitzgibbons , leader of the Police Glee Club , after Mr. Warren , the retiring Commissioner , had reduced him to sergeant a few minutes before Mr. Whalen entered Police Headquarters as the new Commissioner . Mr. Whalen , who said he had known Lieutenant Fitzgibbons for a long time , declared that Mr. Warren signed the order without authority , as he had been sworn in as Police Commissioner an hour and a half before at City Hall , and that the ink on the order was not dry when he found it on the Commissioner 's desk . Mr. Seabury then read into the ree ord a report by Captain Valentine , which charged that Lieutenant Fitzgibbons had received more than $17 , - 000 from the Glee Club funds since 1924 and that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had received $1,500 and recommended reorganization or abolition of the Glee Club and disciplinary action against Lieutenant Fitzgibbons . Some of the large checks to Lieutenant Fitzgibbons were listed as follows : June 18 , 1924 . The Glee Club purchased for Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons a seven-passenger 1924 Buick Sedan , for which they paid Mr. H. F. Huestis , the agent , $2,490 . Nov. 26 , 1924 . The Glee Club presented a check for $500 to Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons for the purpose of defraying the expenses of himself and his wife to St. Petersburg , Fla. , and return . June 4 , 1925 . The Glee Club forwarded a check to Margaret Fitzgibbons for $5,000 , which the lieutenant admits was donated to him through his wife and which was used for the purchase of a house at Kew Gardens . July 13 , 1925 . Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons received a check for $500 from the Glee Club , which he states was a donation to him just prior to the departure of himself and family to Europe . Aug. 26 , 1925 . Acting Lieutenant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Paris , France , without funds , and received $500 from the funds of the Glee Club through the American Express Company . May 19 , 1928 . Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons personally selected a 1928 Packard seven-passenger sedan from Reilly &; Scott of West Fiftysecond Street , Manhattan , for which he agreed to pay $2,500 , and a check made payable to Reilly &; Scott in the amount of $2,500 was presented by Patrolman Burnell to Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons for the payment of said automobile , which is registered in the name of the said Acting Lieutenant Patrick G. Fitzgibbons . June 7 , 1928 . Acting Lieutenant Fitzgibbons received from the funds of the Glee Club a check in the amount of $2,160 , which he states the Glee Club owed him for defraying the expenses of a number of the members of the Glee Club to the Eucharistic Congress held in the city of Chicago , Ill. , in the month of June , 1926 . Valentine 's report added that 32,605 tickets for the Glee Club 's minstrel show in April , 1928 , were distributed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ total money received was $17,083 . The report declared that the order of the Police Commissioner limiting the sale of tickets to friends had been grossly violated . Relied on Committee Report . Mr. Whalen said he had turned over the report to a special civilian committee composed of Gilbert T. Hodges , Dr. John A. Harriss , Lee J. Eastman and Udo Reinach , who absolved Lieutenant Fitzgibbons of wrongdoing and advised that the Glee Club he continued as a valuable police activity , but recommended a businesslike system of accounting . He did not recall having said in an interview published in THE NEW Yonie TIMES that he had thrown the Valentine report in the waste basket , but declared that , in fact , he had turned it over to this committee . He admitted that he never had read the Valentine report until he had received it back with the report of his committee . Earlier in the day , Mr. Cuvillier , Democrat , read into the record a paragraph from THE TIMES to the effect that members of Mr. Seabury 's staff believed that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ill treatment of witnesses at private hearings might be designed to create public sentiment against the private examinations and to bolster legal attempts to stop them . Mr. Cuvillier declared that he could not permit such an assumption to go unchallenged and expressed belief that Mr. Seabury did not believe that any Democratic member of the committee would use his legislative prerogative to try to influence the judiciary , a coordinate branch of government . Mr. Seabury said he did not believe any member of his staff had expressed any such opinion , adding that , in view of the unjustified attack upon his aides on the preceding day , he felt that this attack was entirely in keeping with the series of obstructions from the same source that had marked the investigation from the start .
