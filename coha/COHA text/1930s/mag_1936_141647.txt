To Julius Caesar , St. Augustine of Canterbury , William the Conqueror and almost everyone else through the ages who has traveled between England and the Continent , the English Channel has been an annoying journey . This week marks a partial end of that ancient inconvenience . It is now possible to board a train in London , go to sleep , and wake next morning in Paris , as one of three big train-ferries carries the whole train across the 50 rough miles of water from Dover to Dunkirk . <P> Train ferries are not new . On the Channel , they were first tried during the War for freight only . The new passenger service required the building not only of new ferries , but of new railway cars . The cars are smaller than standard , to take up less room aboard ship , which also carries a garage . Although the ferries can accommodate twelve sleeping cars on four tracks , the first train tried on the run was made of only four cars . It left Paris at 11:30 p. m .. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ticket : $27.30.
