txt Lexington town-meeting members have set off the spark for another revolution , and again it involves taxes . This  --  time , however , it is real estate taxes which the members want slashed from $35.50 to $30 in 1940 . The town representatives chose a novel method to bring their desire to the attention of the Selectmen . About 70 per cent , or 145 of the 204 members , signed a document telling the Selectmen and the Appropriation Committee that they wanted a $30 tax rate next year . I The " Declaration " closes with the I pledge that the " undersigned will I so vote in town meeting as will bring about the result outlined ; herein . " The inference is that should town authorities fail to cut expenses , the town representatives , who have the power to do so , will do the cutting themselves . Houses for Sale Circulated by Harold B. Lamont and other town-meeting members , the paper is the outgrowth of increasing anxiety by the townspeople who have watched real estate sales and new construction in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Conditions have reached a point where it seems that on every street there is at least one house with a " for sale " sign , and local banks hesitate before investing in new building within the town , according to the residents . Real estate brokers have pointed out that neighboring municipalities ? one in particular which cut its tax rate down to an attractive figure in two years  --  are drawing business and residents away from Lexington . An attempt was made last spring to cut clown the appropriations when they came before the annual town meeting for consideration . It was so little successful , however , that the 1939 tax rate of $35.50 , largest in several years , was levied Study Other Towns With the failure of the economy drive , the members sought other means of getting the town to live on a reduced budget . They studied other towns which seemed to succeed on lower rates . Finally , they brought personal experience to the problem , deciding that what they had been forced to do in the face of salary " cuts " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The document does not restrict the Selectmen in ways and means of making reductions . Mr. Lamont and the other signers , whose names will not be made public , felt that the Selectmen and department heads by virtue of their positions were best qualified to know where expenses could be curtailed . So they stated that the authorities " shall feel free to make savings in any town department , board or facility which , in their judgment , shall least decrease the efficiency of essential town operations . " Heavy Savings Required savings of between $50,000 and $60,000 are estimated as necessary to bring the tax rate down to the desired $30 on each $1,000 . This is about seven or eight per cent of the Town 's budget this year , which totaled more than $700,000 . Of this . about $550,000 is in flexible appropriations ; the balance comprises fixed items such as debt service . Some economies have ? already been effected since Mr. Lamont handed the document to the Selectmen , whether as a result of it or not no one will say . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are now shut off at midnight , with a reported saving of $1,300 . A reduction in the school committee budget of about $8,000 is reported ; investigation has begun prodding costs of welfare  --  which jumped in 10 years from $17,000 to $125,000  --  and insurance . Other New England towns with the traditional town-meeting form of government are watching the experiment with a great deal of interest . If successful  --  and no one in Lexington thinks otherwise ? it is expected that the Dlan will be adopted for application in these municipalities . Nor is Lexington planning to let it rest with only one attempt . Members of the town meeting want to see the tax rate down nearer the $25 mark where they maintain it belongs .
