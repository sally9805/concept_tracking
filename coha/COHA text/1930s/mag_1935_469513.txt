mnE other day a farmer called on 1 Jonas Handman to deliver a basket of apples . He knocked on the kitchen door , waited for a while , then went round to the front door and knocked there . Nobody came . Handman had said that he wanted those apples , so the farmer put the basket down on the porch and went back of the house to the barn . There he found Jonas hanging by his neck , dead . Jonas had never been known to do any real work about Littletown ; while his father was living he never had to . And when his father died he left him the store blocks downtown . Jonas seemed to get along very well on the rents up to a few years ago , and was in the pool room most of the time . There were two stores , one with a hall over it that has n't been used for years except for a few months some time ago by the Girl Scout troop . Last year Bill and Ed Brown started a garage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grocery which Jed Simmons had run was closed out after his funeral . The other block had been vacant for a few years , except for a rummage sale or bake-sale in it now and then . The garage did not pay much rent , and you ca n't charge a women 's society for sales , so it seemed that things had turned out badly for Jonas . We had n't realized they were that bad though . The truth is , we do n't miss Jonas Handman very much . He was never , so to speak , a contributing member of our community . But his suicide is the third within the past year . Littletown is small , as its name implies , with only some fourteen hundred people . And three suicides in one year is altogether too many for that population . Some of us are beginning to worry about what is going to happen to our town . The past thirty years have seen many changes in the world , and from the point of view of the small-town man they have not all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a sinister force at work , threatening the very existence of many small towns . Take the little hamlet a few miles from us called The Flats . Thirty years or so ago The Flats was a busy little crossroads with two cheese factories , two stores ( one with a hall over it ) , a blacksmith shop , a shingle mill that took its power from the creek , a school , and a church . They had great times with family reunions , square dances , warm-sugar parties , and the like , and it was known as one of the best communities in our neighbor. hood . To-day not a single one of those signs of business life remains . There is only the old church , empty and unused , and the school with only a handful of pupils . One out of three of the houses within two miles of the crossroads in every direction is unoccupied and falling to pieces . No wonder that we in Littletown are becoming nervous . As the advertising posters begin to be pasted on the inside of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the ghost of The Flats comes over the hill and haunts us . Twenty years , forty years ? and shall we also belong to the Past ? II Littletown is a cozy village in a hollow of the beautiful , surprisingly abrupt hills of southwestern New York . The Baptist church , a few rods down Spring Street from the main corner , is at an elevation of 1400 feet above sea level , while the tops of the hills round about are 1800 and 1900 feet . The only flat land is found in the valleys , and in only small patches there ; in one summer alone three men , tilling the rolling slopes , were hurt by the overturning of tractors . The land has been farmed for a century and a third but is untamed yet ! An ancient glacial lake lay to the north of Littletown long before even the foot of a Seneca Indian had disturbed the deep grass of the pastures of the deer , and the lake left behind , with its shoreline and outlet banks , a level but tortuous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the Genesee . Along this path wound the old cart road to the cities of the north in the early days of settlement in the 1790 's ; and when Clinton 's Ditch traversed the State from east to west a canal was dug over the same gentle path to connect Rochester , with her port on Lake Ontario , to the Allegheny River . It was possible in those days to move slowly up the canal , through Littletown and across to Oleander , where one turned down the Allegheny to the Ohio , thence to the Mississippi and the Gulf . The canalis gone now , but the locks still stand , with now and then a crumbling skeleton of a gate between them ; and there are men in Littletown who will tell you of unloading salt at the Port of Littletown in those days , and women who remember the Sunday School outings when heavily loaded , bunting-draped barges moved off for a day in some grove along the canal . The Pennsylvania Railroad bought the canal and used the tow path as a base for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the same route , and is well traveled ; but the Pennsylvania is a branch line , built to serve the little towns along the old artery of travel . Such is the way of Time that it is running fewer trains each year , the rails are beginning to gather rust , and a concrete highway makes the tires whine as cars speed over the old route of the post road , the canal , and the iron horse . It was nearly a century and a half ago that a group of men discovered the valley in which Littletown lies . It seemed a good place for a town , this little flat patch with passes through the hills to all four points of the compass , so they took up land rights . One faction wanted the village at the north end of the hollow ; the other , at the south , against the hills . Each set up a store and a tavern on its chosen spot ; but the liquor must have been better at the latter place , for North Little-town is now just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ school . The village grew slowly but was regarded as a coming town . A new post road from Buffalo to Pennsylvania was surveyed about 1870 , and Littletown was on one of the two possible routes . The village was astir ; two post roads , a canal ? what more could one ask to insure prosperity ? And then the road went through Oleander , a village of the same size , almost a day 's journey ( in reality , only sixteen miles ) up the swampy valley to the west . Old timers shake their heads and date that city 's rise from the changing of the road . " When I was a boy Oleander was n't as big as we are now , " they say , and sigh the sigh of men who have guessed wrong . But the long grass was still there , and the cows were there , going about the business of the cud unmindful of the fate of village empires down below them . Within ten years after the incident of the road , the milk from more than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ factories tucked away in the folds of the hills , land more than three-quarters of a mil-lion pounds of rich , mild-flavored icheese were marketed through the Littletown exchange each year . Almost all of the land , even in the remotest hills , was in pasture or grain . The little cheese factories are just about all closed now , for cheese can be made at lower cost in Wisconsin and Minnesota ; but there are a few left , and a chain store and a national meat packer still maintain cheese warehouses in Littletown . The War helped Ito change the nature of the dairy in. industry , as it boosted the sale of condensed milk , and several large condensaries were established in and near ? our village . One of them is still operating , the milk being hauled in by trucks that rumble through when the sleepy storekeepers are sweeping out in the morning . Milk prices are low now , and the dairymen who have to pay for long hauls of milk are finding it hard to keep going . The old days of milkprosperity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem likely to come again ; dairying is a serious , corner-cutting , belt-tightening business , and a good many hill pastures are growing up to brush and scrubby timber . There was another time when Fortune gave her Mona Lisa smile to Littletown , and now and again we get a little publicity in some newspaper because of it . It seems that away back in the early days a bowlegged man called Seneca Pete used to drive an old gray mule down from Buffalo with two empty kegs strapped on her back . A mile or so from the village is a scummy spring in a swampy hollow , that used to form a thin film of oily substance over its surface . When flint and steel were struck close to its edge , it would burn for a time . The Senecas guarded it as a treasure , dipping their blankets into it and straining out the precious oil that had oozed up from the rock below . It was thought to be good for snakebite , good for wounds , good for general principles ; and Seneca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Buffalo , there to sell the famous " Seneca Oil " to the doctors . it was the first petroleum discovered in America . When Drake proved the worth of drilling a shag for oil Littletown heard the news with joy . When oil ran out of its own accord , without need of a drilled hole , how much more must there not be below the surface , waiting for the bit to free it and send it spouting up into the sun ? A well was drilled close to the edge of the old spring . The top of the casing still stands in the weeds , ragged , rusty , ashamed . But over the hills , only eight miles away , begins the rich oil field from which the world 's best crude is pumped . Fortune missed us by that slight a margin . A few years ago the men whom oil had made rich came to our town and built a monument in tribute to the spring that had led the way . We are proud of that bowlder with its bronze slab and generally @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would rather have a derrick . In the first decade of the present century , Littletown made its bid as a manufacturing center . A knife factory , a pulley works , a cheese-box factory , and a novelty concern erected buildings and began operations . Perhaps a hundred men were employed , with two dozen others in the two older mills that had been long established for the grinding of feed and flour and the sawing of lumber . An enterprising citizen with little taste put up a whole street of somber houses , all alternately alike , on the edge of town . We had our factories and our slums . We were on the way to becoming a big town . The knife factory died first and one of the banks took it over . The novelty firm moved on . The pulley works went under two years ago . The box factory merged with the saw mill . The buildings still stand there , sagging , empty , and the Chamber of Commerce is busy dangling bait before the eyes of small city businesses , hoping to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the younger business men became impatient and from somewhere managed to raise two thousand dollars , which they gave , together with an old barnlike structure , to a man with an idea for an airplane . The plane almost flew , at that . Commerce , oil , manufacturing ? they have all paid us but fleeting visits . They roused our hopes , they made us dream . Yet on the hillsides the sleek cows still graze , the milk trucks roll through town in the early morning , and the only mills that stood the test of time are the feed and flour mills , grinding out food for the cows . Even the sawmill is owned by the same men that own the feed mill . And it makes cheese-boxes . We have not wanted to be rural , but it seems that we can not help it . III Although Littletown is small , it dots not lack facilities for trade . There are three chain groceries in town , hated like poison by the proprietors of the locally owned groceries , of which there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ urging us to keep our dollars at home , to support home industries , to remember old friends ; but so far only one of them has cleaned up his place of business , painted the front an attractive color , enamelled the shelves , and removed the cat from the warm show window . He gets some of the business that the bright , neat chains get , but the other two have their troubles . We did have two bakeries , one of them half a grocery also . The bakery has gone bankrupt ; the combination hangs on . Bread trucks come in daily from Oleander with fresh rolls and bread and pastry , attractively done up in boxes or transparent paper with no flies inside , and most of our housewives prefer to buy their baked goods that way . If you wish to buy a pair of shoes in our town , you have many opportunities . When the last census was taken , there were only two thousand eight hundred and forty-four feet in the village , but there are six places in which to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , one pool room , one men 's and women 's clothing store , and two drygoods stores ? all selling shoes . Of course , no one of them has a large assortment of either sizes or styles , but ' you may find what you want if you are lucky . There are two meat markets , one run by the man who also manages the moving picture theater . But two of the chain groceries also carry meat , and so one of the markets has put in a line of bread and rolls , cakes , and canned ; goods . He is new to town and swearl that if the competition extends to other ' stores he will put in dresses and cameras and a soda fountain . There is the ever-present ice erean4 parlor , whose owner , in partnership with his brother , also runs an ice cream factory . They make very good ice cream , putting real cream from the local dairies into it ; thus it costs more to make than do the frozen puddings turned out by the Buffalo factories @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the opposite corner from the ice cream parlor carries the Buffalo brand . There are two drugstores and they both sell drugs in addition to watches , alarm clocks , cameras , radios , candles , wall paper , candy , mirrors , pictures , greeting cards , toys , and what not . And there are two pool rooms , two 1 hardware stores , two electric stores , the proprietor of one of which doubles as funeral director , three restaurants , two gift shops with jewelers ' counters , two hotels , four garages . Yes , we have the facilities for doing ! business . Two of everything at least , including two banks to handle the inevitable bankruptcies that come more frequently in recent years . If Prosperity ever dared walk down our main street it would be plucked raw before it had gone half a block . We used to have business too . The farmers ' teams crowded the streets , and their children the stores , and everyone was happy . They used to give you a bag of candy when you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now , with its ten-cent stores and its larger stocks of suits and dresses and furniture , only twenty-five minutes away over a good paved road that we were mighty pleased with when it was first laid down . Sometimes we look back on the paving of that road and grin crookedly . We were proud as Punch when the job was finished . There were editorials in the paper , photographs of leading citizens , and all that . We came within an inch of having one of these celebrations with a symbolic wedding too . If our storekeepers could have seen how much of their business was going to roll over that road to Oleander , they would have worked for a symbolic funeral instead . But they did n't see it and went right on doing business as they had done it for years before , when we had to buy from them or go without . But now , if we do n't like what they have or the price that they set upon it we can try in Oleander without much trouble . A lot of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not seem to realize that the swamps and hills that cut their customers off from the rest of the world are being filled and levelled now , and that their business is in competition with every other store of the same line within forty miles . Even Oleander , now with nearly twenty thousand people , complains that some of its trade is going off to Buffalo , seventy miles to the northeast ; and Oleander has some large stores . Of course , it is true that a man in a small town like ours can not expect to have a large store ; but sometimes I wonder if it is necessary to break up what little business we do have among so many men and make it still smaller . One of the things that keeps business poor is the fact that there just are n't as many people to buy goods as there used to be . Our village declined 117 per cent in population between the last two federal censuses . As for the countryside round us , a drive over the dirt roads in any @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after house stands empty with its shutters banging in the wind . It does no good to call those dirt roads " side " roads ; they were main roads when our village was growing and our present number of stores were founded , and the people who traded with us came over them to market . Modern methods of agriculture have made it possible for one farmer to handle more stock and more land than several farmers could in the former days , and the surplus farmers have moved away . The poorer land is going out of cultivation , as not worth a man 's time , and the better land is being tilled more cheaply and better . The population of the old canal and post road . days is not needed any more . Men do not go down the meadows four and six abreast , swinging their scythes , at harvest time ; one man rides round on a mower . One man sitting on a tractor turns two or three furrows at once . One man milks two cows at once while leaning against a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a business now , and the sheriff sells out the man who can not run his farm in a business way . I can not sigh over the departure of the old days of hand agriculture . I was raised on a farm . I have had a double-shovel give my ribs a Dutch rub when plowing corn in the old stump field , and I am glad that men can farm now more safely for their bones and their religion . The women in farm homes too do not long for the days when the dining room was full of harvesters and the kitchen full of the fumes of hell . The new ways are better . But that does not alter the fact that they mean fewer feet to be shod , fewer legs to be overalled , fewer freckled , sun-browned misses to wear the new , soft dresses . IV The people that live in Littletown are nice . The Legion and the Ku Klux would accept them all . We have very few foreign families ? you could count them on one hand ? and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faithful elderly spinsters waiting to join Ma and Dad , who died and left them without the job that had been husband and children to them ; the usual number of widows and widowers living alone with their memories in rambling , solitary houses ; the usual number of retired farmers sniffing the wind wistfully in the morning ; the usual number of children playH ing in the yards of the smaller houses on the side streets . There are not , many young people though ; the popt.17 lation takes a running jump over the twenties , and the few that are left keep asking , " What 's doing in the city ? Are jobs opening up there yet ? " It makes it rather hard on the young folks in high school . They are determined not to be like Mother and Dad , but there are few in between to copy after . So they read the magazines and go to the movies and get their styles of dressing and acting from there . A little too much lipstick , talk rather coarse and loud , clothes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cities over the horizon when the school bel. has rung for the last time , tell their story . A year or two ago one of the men from the college of agriculture gave the young folks in our high school a questionnaire about their choice of a vocation . Only 16.5 per cent of them said they were planning to do work similar to their father 's , and only 13 . E per cent were intending to stay ir town . Their dreams will change of course , and disappointment will also , come ; but that does not change the present situation much . Our young folks do not like us and see no future , for themselves with us . On Sunday morning the bells in fly steeples ring the call to worship , ane the doors of five churches open for the . crowds of worshippers who will not come . All of our churches have a seating capacity far in excess of their resident membership . Yet we are a fairly religious town ; for a census tha the churches took one year showed that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and the average for the United States is less than that . The proportion is considerably smaller , however , among the country people ; relatively few of them come to our churches , and they have none of their own . They say that their clothes are inferior to ours , and that we are not friendly with them . I think that their clothes are on the whole as good as ours , but they are probably right about the lack of cordiality ; we have had our eyes fixed on the dream of being a big city for so long that we have forgotten the people who tend the cows that filI the milk trucks that rumble through town . Our churches are costly affairs . In 1930 we spent , one of the ministers estimated , $17,507 for the four Protestant churches alone . Thirty years before that the records show that the cost of those same churches , with more members , was only $7,089 . I do not attribute this rise to extravagance but to the upward tendency of our necessities ; thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ necessary for our ministers ; but we do now , for so many of us are college-educated that we abhor scientific blunders in the pulpit . And college men cost us more than illiterate , or semi-so , ministers . The same is true of our pipe organs , our redecorated buildings , our robed choirs . Those things arc part of our modern culture . Our extravagance comes , however , in our insistence that each small church group must have those things for itself . The Methodists , with only ninety-four members , must have those things just as do the Baptists , with two and one-half times as many people over whom to spread the cost . Some people I know have actually declined to join one of our churches , not because they did not feel spiritually ready , but because they knew that they could not stand the financial pressure that is putupon its members . The gospel is far from free in our town . Some efforts have been made toward inter-church co-operation . Union services are held on summer evenings , and even the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The young people of three of the churches began a joint society , but the older folks of one church withdrew their young people after a few weeks , saying that they were having too good a time with the others and feared they might be " weaned away " from their own church . Two of the churches have had a joint men 's class for a few years , and the men got along with one another there as well as they did in the lodges or the business men 's clubs ; but when talk began of union of the two churches at a time when one of them was without a minister some of the women said things that put a stop to it . It may be after we have had a few more burials in our beautiful green cemetery on the hill that church union will come nearer , and we shall become fellow-Christians as well as fellowLittletownians ? but there are those who will term my hope sinful . Although we are losing population , our school is becoming more crowded every year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out in the country districts , as the little schools lose students until only a few are left and the cost per pupil becomes high , the schools are closed and those few children are taken in to our school by buses . Also , more young people above the age at which they are legally required to go to school are wanting to continue on through the high school ; they feel the need of higher education in this day . We shall have to build a new building for them eventually , and yet we hesitate at the cost and keep putting it off . A large part of our taxpaying townsmen are retired farmers whose income is small and limited , whose children are already educated and gone , but whose influence is great . We have a beautiful little library , built by funds which a good woman left for the purpose , and the young folks use it very well . Their parents , except for women who do a deal of novel-reading , do not use it much . We are not enthusiastic in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them be as they are . One of the doctors was fuming the other day that there were eight card clubs in town but not one mother 's club . When evening settles down upon us there are several things that we can do . Generally we sit at home and listen to the radio , which is pleasant in the summer when it can be heard through an open window on the porch . If the night is fair we visit friends ; and if there is something extra on at one of the lodges those of us who are not officers , who would go anyway , attend . We have two lodges , the Odd Fellows and the Masons , the former with a large proportion of farmers in its membership . The leaders of both complain that meetings are poorly attended , not like the good old days . But the rooms are open in the afternoons , and the older men drop in to play checkers and cards and talk . The women have their Rebekahs and Eastern Star and put on bake-sales now and then @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ getting a bit fat ? and the Grange , a number of other organizations in town . A D.A.R . chapter that was recently formed by some lady who belonged to no other club , I think , and who wanted to join one ; a chapter of Daughters of Union Veterans ; a Current Topic club that should properly be called Current Gossip ; the Shakespeare Club that discusses astronomy and art ; any number of card clubs that are the breath of life to the two littlegift shops ; and in each section of town a " sunshine " club that sends flowers and gifts to the sick . The women spend a great deal of time at these various clubs ; for they are , like most small-town women , forever lonesome and inquisitive about one another 's affairs . We have two business men 's clubs , whose main occupation is talking about bringing " new business " to town , but none of them includes in its membership farmers , whose milk trucks bring in all the new business that ever does come . For sport @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fights noisy battles in the park at twilight . The barbers have a team , the railroad men , the feed-mill men , and so on ; " Lucky Tigers , " " Keystones , " " Barney Googles " they call them , and get real sport out of the games . Baseball loosens up the muscles that have been fighting rust on the rails or waiting behind the counters for business to come home and be forgiven , and also takes their minds off the complaining women who wait for their men folk to return at sundown and listen respectfully while they retail the gossip of the clay . V Last year the farmers took a step that disgusted the business men . They organized a co-operative feed store in one of the empty buildings , to handle feed and Hour and the like , buy seeds and fertilizer , and ship some produce as well . The business men regard it as very ungrateful of them , especially in the midst of this business depression . If they had only taken some stock in the knife factory or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ showing real co-operation . But this event proves to them that the farmers do not understand civic needs . One would think that the young people , even more than the women , would be very busy ; for they have any number of organizations for them in the school and the churches and the Scouts and the Hi-Y . Some organization is putting on a sale of some kind , raising money for some purpose , almost all the time . But the truth is , as I have observed , that a few of them belong to nearly everything , with no time even to study , while a great many belong to nothing and do nothing except stand on the street corners and giggle . There really is not much else for those who are not dashing off to some meeting or other to do . They can go to the movies , which cost money , or they can shoot pool , which also costs money and is not too well thought of , or they can go home . They rarely do that except to work @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the promenade . From the library they drift down one side of the street to the tilling station , then cross over and back up the other side , and so on around again . Now and then they pair off and slip away down a side street where the lights are more dim . One winter a new minister suggested opening up some of the rooms of a church and installing ping-pong tables , checkers , a piano , and the like on Friday and Saturday nights . He did n't get far with that idea . " What for ? " was the attitude of his board . " We spend a lot of money on our young folks now , and then when they get through school they go off to the city and we never get it back . And besides it is n't right to use the church property that way ? ' So the card-tables gossip about the goings-on among the younger genera . tion of this awful day ; one of the older ministers fulminates weekly about the drinking and necking proclivities of youth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not remainto marry and settle down and breed a trading population for the town . And all the while the more ambitious and worthy of the young folks are whispering impatiently among themselves , " Let 's get out of here to where something 's doing ! " And that probably is the very spirit that led their ancestors to come to Littletown in the first place . We used to have , not so long ago , considerable doing in our town . Every fall we had a fair , of which we were justly proud . We had halls for exhibits , a race track , a grandstand . I can remember when I used to swallow a whole bag of popcorn without tasting it , as La Paloma won by a nose from Gelter 's Pride or while I watched Zanzibar the snake eater for one dime , ten cents , the decimal part of a dollar . But the fair stopped some years ago for lack of entries , and enthusiasm , and patrons , and money ; and last year we arranged to sell the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debt we owed the printer . The grove just south of town , a clean place of hard maples lifting round bare trunks above the grass , used to he the scene of camp meetings , chautauquas , and political rallies . Tents were pitched amid the trees , water brought from the spring , horses staked out , and the whole family settled down to enjoy religion or whatever there was , while one of the boys ran the farm between hayings . Jolly , informal , full of fist fights and lovemaking , of prayer and mud-slinging , summer camp meetings were the halm of sultry days . Brush grows up in the old grove now , and the cows scratch their lean necks against well-nigh obliterated hearts with arrows stuck through and letters , " H.C . and V.T. " O Time , how could you ? Here it lies , the little village in the lap of the hills , about it the marks of its former happiness and hope , and before it the shadows seen only by itself and the old men who sit on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ They too have lived and dreamed . And the storekeepers agitate home trade , dangle decaying buildings before decaying industries as an attraction to come to Littletown and die , and at the last do as Jonas Handman did . Just between the main highways of travel , just on the edge of the oil field , not big enough to be a city , not small enough to be a hamlet ? wanting things , almost getting things , too alive to die and too dead to grow , what shall become of us ? We have the poor comfort of knowing that our lot is not solitary . There are many villages like ours to-day , facing what we face . We hear talk of the decentralization of industry , of the putting of great factories into small units scattered over many towns , but we know that salvation for us does not lie in the scheme . It may be done , but we know that it will be the villages nearer the great cities than we are that will profit . And the extent of their profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left them ; we had factories once , and they are gone ; nor have the prodigals shed many tears of penitence as yet . Many villages like us are waiting for either factories or farmers to come back ; for over one hundred thousand acres of farm land have been abandoned in our county alone , many times that in the State , and millions in the whole country . Everywhere that this has occurred there are villages with Jonas Hand-mans . Of this , I think we are certain : that the process of shrinking will go on until there are just enough farmers leftoutside our village to supply the milk that the market demands . And when that point is reached there will also be just enough stores Left in Littletown to supply the needs of these farmers . The churches will either die or merge the one with the other until there are just enough churches to accommodate us all , villagers and farmers , in our worship . The little district schools will probably draw together in consolidation until our youth can find in the minimum @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ These things will not happen easily . They will be accompanied by struggle and pain . But if we can see where we are going , and help one another on the way , we may be able to reduce the Jonas Handmans . Littletown is not going to die . Littletown is going to start over again , this time with its eyes open , its goal more real . We shall gain a spiritual dividend from the re-organization of our village life , I think ; for whatever we do we shall have to do together ? and that is good for the soul . One with the countryside , with the old false barrier between village and farm forgotten , with the common interest of storekeeper and dairyman at last known and understood , the renascent Littletown may be a better place than before . For life still goes on about us . Lovers marry and are given in marriage ; children play in the front yards ; men sweat in the fields ; women peel vegetables in the kitchens ; and the cows come home at evening @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pastures . And wherever there is life there are the needs of life , that can not be met by any one man alone .
