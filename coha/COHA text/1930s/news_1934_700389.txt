txt Mayor LaGuardia and Governor Lehman will confer soon on revision of the city charter , it was learned yesterday . Their meeting will precede the introduction by the city administration of any legislation for wholesale charter revision . Expecting a bitter fight on charter revision by Tammany , the strategy of the administration will be to rush through the Legislature several charter changes needed immediately without entwining them with the broader move to change the form of the city government . Pursuing that policy , the administration temporarily is " soft-pedalling " all charter revision legislation , it is understood . Much of the authority Mr. LaGuardia regards as necessary to effect the first reforms is granted to the Board of Estimate under the revamped " economy bill . " Conference Date Not Set .

The sponsors of the bill , Mayor LaGuardia , Samuel Seabury and influential members of the bar association , will press for its passage , but they are not optimistic about its fate . The bill , Mr. Seabury admitted last week , had for one of its purposes the changing of the personnel of the judges of both courts , and for that reason would be fought to the last ditch by Tammany .

His proposal also called for a skeleton city charter to be drawn by a charter revision commission , with the details worked out slowly . Information yesterday was to the effect that that plan had undergone considerable revision . 1 what ways the Seabury idea has been changed was not disclosed , but it was believed that the date of the referendum would have to be much later than originally contemplated . Meanwhile , the process of reducing the number of high-salaried city jobs was continued yesterday by two of Mayor LaGuardia 's commissioners . Post Drops Four More Aides . Langdon W. Fost , Tenement House Commissioner , announced that he had asked for and received the resignations of the four remaining deputy commissioners in his department . Joseph A.
