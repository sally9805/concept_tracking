COME DAY , GO DAY A STORY BY ROAR , K BRADFORD B UGABOO JONES was an artist . He lived his life according to an idea rather than according to a plan . A plan would limit him ; an idea would grow or shrink , expand or contract to meet the current situation . And an idea was better for him , too . An idea was something that remained in the back of a boy 's head and did n't ever trouble him , whereas a plan had to be figured out with much mental labor , for which the big roustabout 's brain was not adapted . So , when the steamboat John D. Grace passed Harahan that Thursday noon , en route for New Orleans , and the old Captain called the roustabouts to the boiler deck and stuffed payday into their pockets , Bugaboo went back to the main deck to let the idea pleasure itself with imaginings . He lay down upon some sacks of cottonseed and turned his mind loose . In almost no time he was singing a disorganized @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Jest wo n't leave a hard-workin ' man alone , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawd . I do n't keer how much dey bothers me . I likes to be bothered by a good-lookin ' woman . ' Cause I got a good-time on my mind , And de doctor ca n't do me no good . " That was Bugaboo 's idea . He had eleven dollars and a red ticket in his pocket . As soon as the Grace was properly tied up at the landing at Bienville Street the mate would take that red ticket and give him his last dollar of wages . And with twelve dollars in silver in his pocket , Bugaboo would go " back of town " and paint a huge picture of joy . Thursday was ever a big day in the life of Bugaboo Jones . It was the climax of the good-timing that started off each Saturday when the Grace got herself loaded down with freight and roustabouts and pulled out up the river for Baton Rouge and Natchez and Vicksburg and all sorts of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , Tuesday , and Wednesday the Grace pulled in at these landings , and Bugaboo toted on and off freight while the country girls , with pop eyes in their heads and jokes on their tongues , lined the top of the levee and giggled and remarked at the audacious carryings-on of the big , fast-talking steamboating man . Then would come Thursday ! Payday in his pockets and good-timing in his soul ! Over back of town  --  between Rampart Street and Claiborne Avenue , a boy with payday in his pockets always could make some kind of fun . . . I 'm gonter eat po'k chops to I gits sick . And cyore myse'f wid old Mink Eye 's gin . Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawd . Suddenly , in the midst of Bugaboo 's happy thoughts came an idea that soured his very soul . Friday ! Friday was that day that always came after Thursday . It was the day that Bugaboo awoke , somewhere over back of town , with a gin-fogged brain and no more payday in his pockets . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its glamour . The odors of restaurant food that on Thursday had been so tantalizing , on Friday were sickening . The women who , on Thursday , had been so gay and good-Iooking , on Friday were dull , ugly creatures with hard faces and sluggish , uncompanionable souls that lacked all the healthy spontaneous fun found in the country girls up the river. , And the worst part of it all was that there never was a thing Bugaboo could do about it but just sit around and feel miserable until Saturday came and the boat pulled out again . " I swear ! " he grumbled . " I do n't see how come I got to go studyin ' about old hard-luck Friday ! Hyar I was havin ' me some fun gittin ' ready for Thursday , and hyar old bad-news Friday had to come crowdin ' into my haid ! I be dog ! Friday is bad enough when she gits hyar widout comin ' into my haid before time . " The more Bugaboo thought of the way his brains were doing him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ worried about what his brains did . They worked or they did n't work , according to their own whim , which was quite removed from Bugaboo . And so long as they did n't interfere with Bugaboo 's personal happiness he paid it no mind . But for a man 's brains to jump into doleful thoughts about Friday when the man himself was busy anticipating the joys of Thursday was too much even for the good-natured Bugaboo to stand . Such action called for reprisals . Bugaboo determined to punish his unruly brains by putting them to work . " Friday jest popped into my mind , " he said . " Now , I 'm gonter set hyar and weary my mind to I tricks me out a trick so 's Friday wo n't be so bad . " It was hard work . Bugaboo was not accustomed to making his mind work , and all sorts of wild ideas popped into it the moment he tried to concentrate . The unpleasant fact of Friday was apparent  --  a day and night of waiting for the boat to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm gonter set hyarand think to my brains git so hot they b'iles , " he said , " or else I 'm gonter trick out a trick on old mean Friday . " Presently the idea began forming . He had recreated in his mind the previous Fridays he had spent in misery , and the first thing which occurred to him was the fact that he always awoke on Friday morning wanting some coffee . And because he never had any money left when he awoke on Friday , he always had to walk from Saratoga Street to the Bien-vine Street Landing , and argue Jesse Dunbar , the steamboat cook , out of a cup before be got one . " Maybe , " he ruminated , " did I take and hide out me a nickel in my yuther pockets , I might forgit to spend hit , and and den I c 'd buy me a cup er cawfee , over back er town . " With that much accomplished , Bugaboo gave his thought-heated brain a recess and resumed his contemplations on the good-time . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The roustabouts were paid their final dollar of wages , and the mate turned his attention to the business of getting the boat unloaded by wharf contract labor . The rousters quickly changed into their best clothes and made for back of town . Many of them were met at the boat by their wives or women friends , who were to accompany them on their holiday . But not Bugaboo . He never had any wives or women friends waiting for him . If a woman sang a song that he liked , or made a joke that struck him as being jolly , that was the woman who won his favor for the moment . But being a steady friend of any woman , experience had taught him , was a worrisome ordeal , and he did n't like worrisome ordeals . By the time Bugaboo got across Rampart Street his mind had tricked out the trick with which he planned to defeat the Friday all-overs . As was his custom , he went straight to Mink Eye 's . Mink Eye 's was a restaurant that developed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eye , " he said as he seated himself at a table , " go start fryin ' me up about five po'k chops and a heap er ' taters . And den come hyar and make tawk wid me . " " Hey , Bugaboo , " responded Mink Eye . " Eatin ' five po'k chops , dis lick , hunh ? " " Not to you gits ' em cooked , " asserted Bugaboo . " Go git busy cookin ' me dem po'k chops and ' taters , ' cause I 'm hongry . And den come hyar . " Mink Eye spread five chops upon the grill and returned to Bugaboo 's table . " I figgered y'all boys 'd git in to-day , so I got some new gin ? " " No mind de gin tawk , " Bugaboo stated . " Looky hyar . " He pulled his twelve silver dollars from his pocket and piled them in a heap upon the table . " Now watch what I 'm fixin ' to do . " He picked up one dollar and set @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said . And , picking up another dollar , he placed it in another spot on the table . " Dis is a Friday dollar . " Then he continued the assorting process , calling " Thursday , Friday , Thursday , Friday " until he had two equal stacks of silver dollars . " Now , Mink Eye , " he said , " I 'm puttin ' dis Thursday money in my pockets . And you take dis Friday money and hold for me to in de mawnin ' when I comes in to git hit . " " You want me to keep dis six dollars , hunh ? " asked Mink Eye . " Yeah , " said Bugaboo . " Dat 's my Friday money which I 'm gonter save to Friday so 's I wo n't be broke and lonesome when Friday git hyar . " " Sposin ' , " speculated Mink Eye , " I forgits to give you dis money when you axes me ? Sposin ' I forgits you gim me hit ? " Bugaboo grinned . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you ? Well , efn you forgits to gim me dis money , even efn I do n't ask for hit , well , I 'm gonter take you by de heels and knock de roof offn dis house . " Mink Eye laughed , took the six dollars , and served Bugaboo a slug of raw gin . " Whet yo ' appetite up for dem po'k chops and ' caters , " he explained . The pork chops and potatoes were served presently , and Bugaboo consumed them with businesslike method . He got up , handed Mink Eye a dollar from his " Thursday " allotment and , with five dollars in his pocket , he went out upon the street to paint such a picture of joy as should happen to pop into his mind . The first thing that caught his attention was a garish poster in front of a moving-picture establishment , It was the picture of a man with hairy pants on , riding a pitching horse over a high cliff and into a pool of water , below . " Ah , Lawd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in de river , son ! I 'll pull you out quick as you hits de water ! " " He sho ' do ride him , now , do n't he ? " The voice came from a woman who stood near Bugaboo . Bugaboo turned and saw a bright-skinned yourig woman with a friendly smile on her face . " I say he kin ride him , " agreed Bugaboo . " And de doctor ca n't do him no good ! " The woman laughed . " I bet you ca n't ride dat ole buckin ' hoss like dat man kin , " she offered . " I bet I kin , too , efn I had me a Texas saddle and some hairy pants , " Bugaboo declared , " and I ai n't no boss rider , neither . " " What kind er rider is you ? " " I 'm a steamboat rider . I rides de steamboat to she moans and groans . " The woman laughed again . " I do n't blame de steamboat f 'm moanin ' and groanin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hit . " Bugaboo stuck his hand into his pocket and pulled out a dollar . " Hyar , " he said . " Go over yonder at de window and buy us some tickets to see dis man ride de hoss . And jest keep de change . " " I ! mowed you was a lonesome spo't quick as I seed you , " the woman said . " I said to myse'f , I said I bet yonder is a big , good-lookin ' rounder which is a dead game spo't , but he ai n't spo'tin ' ' cause he ai n't got no lady friend to go spo'tin ' wid . ' I said , I bet efn I was a good-lookin ' woman , I bet I could make friends wid dat big sapsucker . ' Dat 's jest what I said . " Bugaboo was happy all over . " You must be a good-lookin ' woman , den , " he assured her , " ' cause you sho ' done made friends wid me . My name is Bugaboo . What 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Alberta , " said Bugaboo . " I used to sing a song about a lady named Alberta . Hit say like dis : ' I would give you mo ' money den yo ' aprons can hold , Poor Alberta , do n't you grieve about no dime . ' Cause de doctor ca n't do you no good . ' " " I do n't need no doctor when I got you , Big'n , " Alberta laughed . The show was dull so far as Bugaboo was concerned . The stuffy air of the theater , the flicker of the picture before his eyes , and the five pork chops , a mountain of potatoes , and a slug of wild gin in his stomach , all combined to put him into restful slumber . When the picture ended Alberta shook him awake and led him outside . The streets were dark , save for the occasional carbon electric lights that flickered and clattered overhead . " I bet I 'm gonter take dis change I had f 'm de dollar , " she told him , " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You likes gin ? " Bugaboo took another dollar from his pocket and gave it to her . " When you uses up dat change , " he said to her , " take dis dollar and buy us some more gin. ? He guided her back to Mink Eye 's . The place was fairly crowded with night revelers . The waiters were busy serving food and drinks . A jangly upright piano in the corner was being performed upon by a tall , yellow man . Everybody was gay . Alberta ordered two drinks of gin . The drinks were ten cents each , and she had seventy cents change from the dollar with which she had bought the show tickets , besides the whole dollar Bugaboo had given her . But after the third drink Bugaboo emptied his pockets of money . " ' fake dese three dollars , " he said , " and keep on buyin ' us some more gin . I 'm got a gin cravin ' in my soul , and de doctor ca n't do me no good . " But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she said . " I ai n't gonter buy you no more gin to drink to I gits up and sings me a song . " " Sing dat song , gal , " urged Bugaboo , " ' cause I 'm makin ' me some fun , and I craves me a heap er singin ' . Go on and sing me dat song at me . " Alberta got to the floor and asked the piano player to " gim me a chord . " She sang : " Drink a ba'aI er Mink Eye 's gin . Drink a ha'al er rye . But I ai n't gonter drink no cawn whisky . ' Cause I ' fraid I 'll die . " " Goon wid dat song , baby ! " Bugaboo cheered . " De doctor ca n't do you no good ! " Alberta essayed another verse : " Jest a little bit er whisky . Jest a little bit er gin . Doctor say hit 'd kill poor me . But he did n't say when . " The patrons joined Bugaboo in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ having more fun than he knew how to handle sitting down , got to his feet and joined Alberta . " Now , you done sung dat song , " he said . " Now , le 's I and you dance . Le 's do de po'k chop dance ! " " I do n't know dat dance , " confessed Alberta . " I do n't neither , yit , " Bugaboo laughed , " ' cause I 'm jest fixin ' to make hit up , now . Us 'll git hit started and spread out as we goes along . " He caught Alberta by the hand and started walking around in a small circle . " Play us some music , " he told the piano player . " Somethin ' kind er slow and jumpy . So 's I kin tawk and dance , too . " The piano player improvised some kind of happy foolishness , and Bugaboo began , " Well , I went in and told Alberta , hyar , I say , ' Alberta , I wants me some po'k chops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feet to simulate the decision for pork chops . " Now , Alberta , " he directed , " you take and dance a few licks and say us ai n't got . no po'k chops . " Alberta , catching the spirit of the dance , did her steps and said , " Us ai n't got no po'k chops , son . " And she added out of her own imagination , " You know po'k chops do n't grow . You ca n't have no po'k chops unless you go buys some . " Bugaboo did another step . " Well , efn hit ai n't no po'k chops hyar , I 'm gonter go git me some , ' cause I 'm pyore po'k chop hongry . " And he danced to the butcher shop . " Now Alberta , " he directed again , " you got to be de butcher whilst I buys some po'k chops . " He danced up the butcher shop steps and ordered four pounds of pork chops , to the stop-time of the piano . Alberta laid the pork loin @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of chops that were needed to make the four pounds . She sliced the meat with a knife , and when she struck the bone , she sawed through it , hissing through her teeth to imitate the noise of the saw , and doing a graceful side step to give her body the motion of wielding the saw . She put the chops on the scale and weighed them , and had an extended argument with Bugaboo about the price . Finally she wrapped them up , and Bugaboo took them and danced home , where Alberta , now in her original role , broiled them . Then the happy couple ate them , and finally fed the bones to the dog  --  all to the stop-time improvisations of the piano player . Everybody was hilarious . Bugaboo and Alberta were the center of attraction and the recipients of many drinks . Mink Eye broke his long-standing custom and treated . The patrons followed suit , and the two dancers soon were literally flooded with gin . " I ai n't never had so much fun in my life ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do me no good ! " But after all the human system can stand only so much of Mink Eye 's gin , and under the shower that followed the dance , Bugaboo 's system soon reached that point . He went to sleep . When he awoke it was morning . He was sitting in his chair with his arms and head resting on the table . The room was empty , save for a sleepy-eyed cook and Bugaboo . And the room , which the night before had presented such a joyous aspect , was a dreary , sordid place that morning . The place reeked with odors  --  food , dead cigar and cigarette butts , and stale gin . Bugaboo raised his head wearily and surveyed the scene with a heavy eye . " Ugh ! " he grunted . " You 's awake , hunh ? " asked the cook . " I thought you wa n't never gonter wake up . Mink Eye say let you lay Jar and git yo ' nap out ? " Bugaboo turned a bleary eye upon the cook , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and groaned again . " What de matter , son ? " pressed the cook . " You ai n't feelin ' sick , is you ? " Bugaboo once more surveyed the landscape , stupidly , this time . " I do n't know whar I 'm at , " he grumbled , " but I bet to-day 's Friday . " " You bets right. , " confirmed the cook . " Now , hyar 's dem six dollars which Mink Eyc say I got to give to you quick as you wakes up . " Bugaboo put the money into his pocket without enthusiasm . " What I wants , " he announced , " is some eawfee . Hot and black . " The cook served the steaming hot drink . Bugaboo tasted it and grimaced . " Boy , " he said , " I told you I wanted some eawfee. " " llat 's cawfee , " the cook maintained . " You go look and see efn you did n't git mixed up , son , " Bugaboo said . " Go see efn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put de dish water in de cawfcc pot . " " Go on and drink dat eawfee , son , " the cook grinned . " You needs hit . Or maybe efn hit ai n't strong enough , maybe I kin find sonaethin ' in de jug somewhars which is . " The cook presently brought out a slug of gin . Bugaboo raised it to his lips , but something grabbed him by the throat and choked him , and his stomach began jumping up and down inside him . He set the drink down , untouched . After looking at the coffee and the gin for several miserable minutes , he got up . " Ryer , take dis dollar for dat stuff , " he told the cook , " and keep de change . " " Naw , suh , " grinned the cook . " Mink Eye say after last night , you ca n't pay for nothin ' in dis place . He say you jest ax for what you wants and hit 's yo'n . " But Bugaboo did n't hear ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Street looked no happier than the inside of Mink Eye 's . Already the sun was shining hot upon the open gutters , bringing up offensive odors from decaying refuse . The houses were jammed too close together , and emitted odors of people too closely congregated together . " Ugh , " groaned Bugaboo . " Old Friday sho ' done crope up on me again . " Suddenly a shutter of one of the houses flew open , and a woman stuck her head out . She was a sorry-looking woman , bleary-eyed , with tousled hair , and a sour expression on her face . " Hey , dere , you ! " she called . Bugaboo stopped and turned . " You heyin ' at me ? " he asked . " Yo ' name is Bugaboo , ai n't hit ? " the woman asked . " Maybe , " he admitted . " How come ? " " Well , " said the woman , " come hyar and git yo ' money . " " Which money ? " " Yo ' money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to buy de show tickets , and dot was only thirty cents . Den you gived me one more dollar and three more dollars to buy gin wid . And I did n't bought only but three drinks er gin for me and you , and dat 's sixty cents more . And thirty cents for de show and sixty cents for de drinks outn all dem five dollars you gived me , well , dat leaves four dollars and a dime . Hyar , come git hit . " Bugaboo blinked his eyes . Faintly he began recalling things . " Yo ' name must be Alberta , ai n't hit ? " " No mind what my name must be , " she retorted . " Take dis money and do n't argy wid me . " " Well , Alberta , " Bugaboo said with feeling , " you sho ' do n't look as good dis mawnin ' as you did last night . " " You do n't look so handsome , yo ' ownse'f , you soot-colored ape , " she came bath . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ business . " " Aw , do n't worry me , " grumbled Bugaboo , " go on and keep dat money . " Alberta leaped through the window and grabbed Bugaboo viciously . " Do n't you come tryin ' to give me no money ! " she yelled . " I 'm a nice lady and I do n't take money Um no man . I works for my money . Washin ' and ironin ' clothes ! And you , you **29;64;TOOLONG , you gonter take dis money , or else I 'm gonter call de police ! " " Aw , shet up , " growled Bugaboo . " Gim me de money and git back in de house . Hit makes me sick to my stummick to jest look at you . I do n't like you nohow . " Mechanically he turned his steps toward the Bienville Street landing . His head hurt and his stomach floated around inside him like a balloon . There was much activity at the landing . The Kersweg was almost loaded and ready to pull out for the Teche @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Baton Rouge . A long stream of freight toters went back and forth on the Tennessee Belle , like so many ants , stowing away cargo for the Bends . But the old John D. Grace , her unloading process completed and the reloading not to begin for hours , rode high in the water . Bugaboo climbed upon a stack of cottonseeds and lay down . Although freight toting in New Orleans was strictly work for stay-at-home men who toiled by the hour , and no self-respecting roustabout would stoop to such work , Bugaboo almost wished that he was toting freight instead of lying upon the cottonseed . He rolled upon his back and looked straight into the sky overhead . He was n't sleepy . He was n't hungry . He just had the Fridays . He lay still , feeling terrible , for a long time . The sun rose higher and shot its straight rays through his black skin . Hours later a group of women came to the wharf and stood about , waiting for the steamer Ouachita , which was due in from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chatter annoyed Bugaboo and once more he put his troubles into a song : " Women chatter like a old guinea-hen . Do n't say nothin ' I want to listen at . Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawdy , Lawd . " The chatter ceased immediately , and one of the women  --  one with a quick tongue and fast words , spoke . " Boy , " she said , " you sho ' is singin ' a crazy song . " " Cou'se I 'm singin ' me a crazy song , " he growled , " ' cause I 'm crazy . " " Hit sounds purty good , even efn hit is crazy , " the woman said . " Sing some more at me . " " I ai n't singin ' at you . " Bugaboo remained flat on his back , not even interested enough in the fast-talking woman to roll over and look at her . " Y'all women jest tawk and tawk and tawk to you drives a man crazy . I swear ! Ev'y since y'all been hyar , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ jest like a drove er jay-birds argyin ' about which one is gonter eat de worm , did they had a worm to eat ! How 'm I gonter git any sleep wid all dat kind er racket goin ' on ? " " You wa n't sleepin ' , " the woman reminded him . " You was singin ' . " " How 'm I gonter sing , den ? " demanded Bugaboo . " You had done quit singin ' , " the woman argued . " You was jest layin ' up yonder , like a old possum on a log . " But Bugaboo was mad . " Well , how 'm I gonter lay up hyar like a possum on a log wid a bunch er y'all Feist dogs yippin ' and carryin ' on at me ? " " Well , " conceded the woman , " go on and lay . Lay ! And hatch , too ! And I 'll bet when you hatches , you 'll be a buzzard ! " Bugaboo almost grinned at that smart talk . But he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He just lay still , feeling sorry for himself . Presently , the Ouachita whistled for the landing , and he rolled over . In a few minutes the roustabouts had her moored in her berth and were receiving their final dollar of wages from the mate . The women paired off with their men and lost no time getting off to the good-times that awaited over back of town for roustabouts with a payday . That is , all the women except one . She stayed and argued with the mate about something . Bugaboo could not hear what she was saying and , although she was not fast-talking with the mate , he could tell that she was the same one who had annoyed him a few minutes before . He watched her , mildly interested . Presently the woman walked away . She was crying a little , Bugaboo noted . He poked his head over the side of the cottonseed pile when she passed and called to her . " What you want ? " she demanded , gruffly . " Somethin ' de matter , hunh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , hard and cold . " None er yo ' business , " she said . " Shawt-tawkin ' me do n't he'p yo ' troubles none . I got troubles my ownse'f , and shawt-tawkin ' do n't cyore ' em . Now , come on and tell me what de trouble before I smacks you down . " " Yancey , " the woman whined . " He did n't corned back . He was jue back , but he did n't git hyar . Cap 'm Sam say he quit de boat at Monroe and went off wid a gal up de river . " " So dat make you cry , hunh ! " snorted Bugaboo . " Cryin ' about a man which is done left you ! " " He was jue back wid some wages , " wailed the woman . " And I had done quit my job er work on account er hit wa n't no sense in me and him bofe workin ' . And now I ai n't got no work , and I ai n't got no money , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money from his pocket and handed it to the woman . " Hyar , " he said , take dis money and stop yo ' blubberin ' . Now , you got money , and you do n't need to work . I swear ! A blubberin ' woman makes me mad jest to look at Now , git ! " The woman 's face brightened . " And money ai n't de mainest thing I got now , " she grinned . " I got me a big ole man like you to he'p me spend hit ! You dat song-singin ' man , ai n't you ? Quick as I hyared you singin ' dat song , I says to myse'f , I says , ' I bet dat big scound'el c 'd change my mind about Yancey . ' I said , I bet I c 'd love dat big old song-singin ' sapsucker !

I gived you dat money ' cause hit was a burden in my pocket ? " " But darlin ' ? " " Do n't you darlin ' me ! " Bugaboo exploded . " Git on away f 'm me and let me be . Or else I 'll take dat money away f 'm you and chunk you in de river ! " The woman left . Bugaboo returned to his pastime of feeling miserable . Nearing sundown , he went aboard the Grace , hunted up the cook , and asked for some supper . Although his actual connection with the steamboat began with each trip that he made as a roustabout and ended when he received his final dollar pay when she was tied up at the landing , he always managed to talk Jesse Dunbar out of a few spare meals after his money was gone . Sometimes he had to beg ; frequently he manufactured marvelous promises of return favors ; and on occasions , when Jesse was especially obstinate , he threatened violence @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a thoroughly miserable day , baking in the hot sun , the idea of an argument with Jesse appealed to him . But there was no argument . Jesse greeted him the instant he poked his head above the boiler deck . " Hey , Bugaboo ! " he called . " I been kind er watchin ' out for you . I knowed you was jue to git broke and hongry before pullin ' - out time , and I kotched me a big catfish which got to messin ' around a hook I had in de river , and I got him all fried up brown . Open yo ' mod and see how he tastes . " Bugaboo feasted . Then he went below and to sleep . When he awoke it was morning once more . Freight was stacked all over the main deck . All night the toters had worked , and the feverish activities continued well into the day . When he was up , getting breakfast from Jesse , he heard the captain tell the mate to hurry things along , as there were four @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Bugaboo grinned to himself . Friday was gone , now . Long gone . It was Saturday ! He busied himself about the boat , assisting the driver in having the freight placed on deck , and the day sped by swiftly . Just before pulling-out time , he ambled ashore , joined the other roustabouts who were to make the trip , got his ticket from the mate , and led the crew down the gangplank with his own elaborate brand of the coonjine step . He was a happy man . Payday Thursday was gone . But so was old COME DAY Friday , too . And now it was Saturday , with a whole bunch of country landings and just enough freight toting to keep his appetite whetted before him ! He was fixing to ride the old whistle-blowing , bell-ringing , water-churning John D. Grace plum up to Vicksburg and back again , painting a picture of pure joy all the way up and down , with finishing touches over back of town in New Orleans ! He had just completed one such picture and now he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the picture he had just completed needed a few final touches  --  touches that would give it the desired balance and feel . These touches were not made until the Grace had squared herself in the river and actually was churning her way up stream . Bugaboo was on the forward main deck , comfortably sprawled upon some grain bags . Around him were other roustabouts , bragging and talking of the fun they had had on their holiday . " Shuh ! " he snorted . " Y'all boys ai n't made no fun . You had jest ought to see me ! Hit was a lady over back er town named Miss Alberta . And Lawd , Lawd ! Me and dat good-lookin ' heifer done us a po'k chop dance at Mink Eye 's dat was more fun den I kin shake a stick at ! I axed her to cook me some po'k chops , and she say she did n't had none .

De doctor could n't do her no good ! " " You do n't saw off po'k chops , " objected one of the rousters . " Who do n't saw off po'k chops ? " demanded Bugaboo .
