Lumbering into the annual stockholders meeting of his substantial ( $362,000,000 ) Consolidated Oil Corp. , Oilman Harry Ford Sinclair last week declared : " Either one of two things must happen . The price of finished products must go up or the price of raw material go down . I do not believe that this industry can continue to sell its finished products below the cost of raw materials . " <P> Immediate reason for Harry Sinclair 's pronunciamento was a small loss on Consolidated 's operations in the first quarter ( figures not made public ) . Since last year when the Government convicted a batch of the major oil companies under the Sherman Act , fear of further anti-trust suits has kept oilmen from attempting to do anything about relieving the market of distress gasoline stocks , which have reached an unwieldy total . Refiners now get an average of .7 cents a gallon less than they did last year . Crude production , however , has been kept within reasonable bounds by State proration laws and the official price is comparatively high . Consequently @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of gasoline is not enough to meet the cost of refining . <P> To integrated companies ( such as Standard Oil of New Jersey , Texas Corporation , Gulf Oil ) , this is not vital . If their refining operations show a loss , it is merely a bookkeeping matter provided that their crude oil production is efficient , shows a greater profit , for they still have net earnings . To Consolidated Oil which has to buy approximately half the crude oil it refines-and to other refiners without their own crude oil supply-the difference between the prices of crude and of gasoline is serious . <P> For them Harry Sinclair spoke a great truth when he said finished products must go up or raw materials down . Last week many feared the latter would happen . In Illinois , Arkansas , Louisiana , producers began to cut prices as much as 10 a barrel below the $1.02 figure established when the last cuts took place in October .
