IT IS a common assumption that poetry , and indeed all writing , is a communicative act . " The difficulty of literature , " said Stevenson , " is not to . . . affect your reader , but to affect him precisely as you wish . " And since words are in their common nature instruments of communication , this seems plausible . Yet most poets would resist any such sweeping assumption , and John Stuart Mill even proposed to identify poetry as speech not meant to be heard but overheard . In these days when critics loudly acclaim a poem like Hart Crane 's " The Bridge " as one of the greatest of our generation , and quite incidentally remark that they do not know what the poet is talking about , it seems to me this question needs looking into . Hart Crane once showed me a poem of his which began with a quotation in Latin , a language which I learned at a time when I had small interest in learning . I sat down and puzzled for a while and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not understand and asked Hart Crane to translate it . " I do n't know what it means , " he said , " I do n't understand the language at all . " Tossing me this information quite casually , he continued an animated conversation with the red-lipped girl who had brought us together , and I continued to puzzle over his poem . After struggling a while with the English parts of it , I returned to the Latin as more communicative . To spare the reader a Iike struggle , I will quote here a poem which according to its admirers is " far from being one of Mr. Crane 's more difficult compositions . " The poem seems simple enough and very sincere and also in a way beautiful . But does it not tantalize you with a certain reticence ? To me it is the most exasperating of attractive things . It gazes out of the page significantly and in my direction and with signs of intense emotion , but will not open its lips , will not make friends ? will not , as we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not know anybody more freely and unaffectedly communicative than Hart Crane himself . He is particularly communicative about his poems ? so much so that it is impossible , returning to the poems after a conversation with him , to continue in the belief that poetry is essentially an act of communication . It seems in his rase to be a thing that begins whenever he stops communicating . Hart Crane is not only generous in communication , but also ? at lenst as regards the English parts of his poetry ? swift and convincing . He can very handily dispose of any skeptic who ventures to suggest that each syllable is not rich with values both of meaning and experience . He is , in fact , so brilliant in this process that he always proves beyond a glimmer of doubt not only that his poetry when explained by him can be understood by anybody , but also that when not explained by him it can be understood by nobody . Consider , for instance , that stanza about the calyx of death 's bounty giving back . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to Harriet Monroe , the editor of Poetry , " refers in a double ironic sense both to a cornucopia and the vortex made by a sinking vessel . As soon as the water has closed over a ship this whirlpool sends up broken spars , wreckage , etc. , which can be alluded to as livid hieroglyphs , making a scattered chapter so far as any complete record of the recent ship and her crew is concerned . In fact , about as much definite knowledge might come from all this as anyone might gain from the roar of his own veins , which is easily heard ( have n't you ever tried it ? ) by holding a shell close to one 's ear . " No one will deny that these lines with their exegesis reveal in the author a genuine and rare poetic mind and feeling . It is equally certain that without exegesis they reveal little or nothing at all . But this fact does not disturb Hart Crane in the least . It does noteven occur to his mind . He is not defending @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ integrity in the art of talking to himself in public . If any reader proud of his sensitiveness to poetry feels inclined to boast that he did understand about " the calyx of death 's bounty giving back , " I suggest that he now cover up with a sheet of paper the paragraph following this one , and write down on the paper his understanding of Mr. Crane 's first stanza ? the one in which the dice of drowned men 's bones bequeath an embassy . After he has done that let him remove the paper , and see how near he has come to Mr. Crane 's own explanation of its values . " Dice bequeath an embassy , in the first place , by being ground ( in this connection only , of course ) in little cubes from the bones of drowned men by the action of the sea , and are finally thrown up on the sand having ' numbers ' but no identification . These being the bones of dead men who never completed their voyage , it seems legitimate to refer to them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mute evidence of certain things , experiences that the dead mariners might have had to deliver . Dice as a symbol of chance and circumstance is also implied . " Here again we have obviously to do with a sincere poetic mind and feeling . All that was lacking in those four lines of poetry was this sixteen lines of communication . Hart Crane may never grow up to the point of embodying his communication in his poetry , but he will deserve mention in the history of culture if only for having so specifically disproven the hard saying of Pascal that " People would never traverse the sea . . for the mere purpose of seeing , without the hope of ever communicating what they have seen . " I had the pleasure not long ago of hearing James Joyce read ? or rather recite , for he can no longer sec the letters ? a few pages from his Anna Livia Plurabelle , and discussing with him its unintelligibility . I wonder if he will object if I employ the memory of that conversation in order to prove by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of necessity a communicative act . Our meeting had resulted from the publication by me of two essays in which I maintained that the literary tendency called " modernist " is in reality a confusion of two tendencies ; a tendency to abandon the interpretation of experience is confused with a tendency to cease even communicating it intelligibly . Not long after publishing those essays I happened to be in Paris and I dropped in to see my friend Sylvia Beach who runs the charming and historic little bookstore called " Shakespeare &; Co. " in the rue de l'Odeon . Sylvia Beach is the heroical woman who first published James Joyce 's Ulysses , an ardent admirer of what I had criticized as the Cult of Unintelligibility . Instead of the glance of reproof which I expected from her , however , I received a most cordial greeting , and her first words were , " Joyce likes your essay in HARPER 'S so much ? I wonder if you would have time to take tea with him while you are in Paris . " I had time of course @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my essay , but thought it was " sound criticism " ? a word which I have saved carefully and carry around with me for the confounding of his embattled disciples . Some other words of his in that conversation I saved , because they led me to this step beyond the position taken in that essay ? they led me to think it is erroneous in the first place to define literature as communication . Joyce seems a simple , earnest , and very quiet person ? poised and gently indignantabout his blindness ? an intellectual and yet not a thinking type , a family man too , and like all great men , from Napoleon up , not excessively masculine . He began our conversation by saying something that would seem to contradict flatly my thesis about modernism . He told me how glad he was that , even though I found so much of him unintelligible , I had at least enjoyed his humor . " It would be terrible , " he said , " to think that I had done all that work and not given @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hours making that little book I sent you . Six hundred hours , and what a waste of time if it had brought you no pleasure at all ! For certainly the motive of an artist ? of all artists , whether they are conscious of it or not ? is to give pleasure to others . " " I am very much surprised to hear you say that , " I said . " But it is true , is n't it ? " he answered earnestly . And then he told me that into the prose of the little book in question ? Anna Livia Plurabelk ? he had woven the names of five hundred rivers . The book in a certain sense is , or is about , a river . Indeed , I now remember that Joyce told me before reciting a passage from it that either two people , or a rock and a tree , or the principles of organic and inorganic nature , are talking to each other across a river . One of his learned commentators has since issued a paper to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ female , which are talking across this river ; another maintains that it is two washerwomen ? but I believe only what Joyce told me . As he spoke the lines I watched him and saw how much every syllable weighed and carried to his mind and feeling and , since I could not myself understand the syllables , and therefore could not think and feel what he was thinking and feeling , my mind wandered a little from the music and I thought what a wonderfully different thing an intense artist is ? or a man in the mood of artistic rapture ? from an ordinary practical-minded adult . An artist is a man consecrated to the child 's attitude toward values and yet translated by his consecration into a world in which childhood is the sovereign thing , and growing up a mere unfortunate incidental necessity . Joyce was reciting his lines for me , to " give pleasure " to me , lines on which he had worked six hundred hours and woven into them the names of five hundred rivers , and yet I did not hear @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have not yet found more than three and a half rivers . Moreover , having had something to do with inductive and deductive logic , I know that if it took six hundred hours to weave those rivers into that prose , it will take something like six thousand hours to weave them out . I can not help asking myself how many people will do this work , and how much fun they will have doing it . If Joyce 's artistic motive really is to give pleasure to others , it seems fair to say that he has wasted about five hundred of those six hundred hours burying the names of those rivers where people who might happen to want them would not be able to find them . Of course Joyce is deceiving himself when he says that his principal motive is to give pleasure to others . And Joyce is , like so many Irishmen , more recklessly sentimental than most of us , and so not unpracticed in deceiving himself . He told me , I remember , that he liked to think how some far @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lad or lass in reading that tittle book would be pleased to come upon the name of his or her own home river . And while that seemed a sweet whiff of a thought , it also seemed a highly incidental one , and I could not helpthinking that if the pleasure of that actual lad and lass had entered into the author 's motivation , he might have provided some little key or pirate 's chart of some kind which would enable them to dig up their river without doing all that unnecessary hard labor . I do not know whether I said this or not , but to something that I said Joyce answered in exactly these words : " The demand that I make of my reader is that he should devote his whole life to reading my works . " He smiled as he said that ? smiled , and then repeated it . And my answer was , " You absolutely insist on giving them all that pleasure ! " But I did not make my answer of course , because I did not think of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ things down to remember them . I only thought what I have often thought before , both in reading Joyce and in reading the encomiums written by his disciples , that the first and very principal thing to say about them all is that their minds are untrained and incoherent . They do not know how to think . Joyce believes he is writing his present extremely unintelligible prose because , whereas Ulysses gave us a day in the life of a man , his present work gives us the night . " In writing of the night , " he said to me , " I really could not , I felt I could not , use words in their ordinary connections . Used that way they do not express how things are in the night , in the different stages ? conscious , then semi-conscious , then unconscious . I found that it could not be done with words in their ordinary relations and connections . When morning comes , of course everything will be clear again . I 'll give them back their language . They really need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them back their English language . I 'm not destroying it for good ! " It was impossible not to be charmed by the mild high delicate voice and the gentle smile with which this grandiose reassurance was offered . I almost hope that it may not be fulfilled , for I think it would be something of a descent from Olympus if Joyce came back and began really to talk to us again . At any rate I do not for one moment believe that the idea of writing about the night is anything more than an interior pretext upon Joyce 's part for amusing himself with words in the way he chooses . The tendency appears often enough ? and with no such pat reason ? in Ulysses . Moreover , it seems obvious to me that an author who sincerely desired to convey to a reader the experience of falling asleep ? through the various stages , conscious , semiconscious , unconscious ? would not begin by taking the names of five hundred rivers and burying them so deep in a passage of polyglottic cryptography that the poor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with seventeen foreign language dictionaries , six encyclopedias , seven pounds of coffee , an atlas , and a World Almanac , in order to dig up a half dozen of them . Joyce may be trying utterly and absolutely to give himself to a series of experiences which he connects in some way with the process of falling asleep ? to give himself to them and to the words which revive and enrich them for him ; although of that , too , I am skeptical . But he is not devoting a moment 's attention to the very complex and delicate problem of the strategy by which he might possibly contrive to communicate some of those experiences to somebody else . His character as a stylist in this recent work does not lie in any loose semblance to the operations of a drowsing mind , nor yet in the scope of his linguistic researches . It lies in the fact that he is doing an intellectual and imaginative labor gigantic in its proportions , obdurate in its persistence , with no practical end in view whatever , not even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself in the art of playing by himself in public . Practical and downright people can hardly help suspecting that there is something of a hoax about this whole Cult of Unintelligibility . They ought to remember that this same cult with its accompaniment of verbal and grammatical concoction swept over the literary world once before , and that our gentle Shakespeare in ripe years was a ringleader in the movement . In some of his later plays , " A Winter 's Tale " for instance , Shakespeare talks ? and what is worse , he makes his characters talk ? a private experimental cerebral gibberish of his own that goes often almost as far away from verbal communication as the most extravagant perpetrations of the modernists . Moreover , the tendency represented in those plays flourished long and spread over Europe and reached a most Joycean climax in the writings of a gifted Spanish poet , Luis de Gongora , whose Estilo Cult ? became the literary sensation of a decade that in many other ways corresponds to ours although preceding it by three hundred years . It is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lexical experimentation altered the fundamental social attitude in which all his great poPtry was composed . It is simpler to think that he experienced a shift of interest . That fascination with the ways and tastes of words which had obsessed him all his life long , grew upon him here ; he gave free rein to it ; he played in his mind with the beings of words more than of the things denoted by them , and a quite fantastic and tantalizing obscurity resulted . But the result was not the motive . Shakespeare was probably not playing any more exclusively in his own mind in this mad I dialogue than elsewhere ; he was playing with different things . The error is to assume in either case that poetic creation is essentially and of necessity communicative . It seems to me , however , equally erroneous to jump to the opposite extreme , and assert that the motive and the fact of communication play no part at all in poetry ? and even in modern poetry of the extreme type . It is not true , as Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their poems merely in order to give them an objective existence . They could do that by pinning them up nicely on the inside of the barn door . The poems are made out of speech ; they are made out of communication ; they imply some sort of publicin-the-abstract even when they tell nothing , and it is a quite natural and simple act to put them before a public . But it is also true that they are not addressed to , or composed for , that public , and that if a public should during the process of their composition march into the chamber and preposterously attempt to respond , the poet would be shocked and injured immeasurably or he would be deaf and he would not hear . He is speaking before people but he is not speaking to them . They are the occasion , not the cause , the pretext , not the purpose , of his speech . I am not going to pretend that I can explain how this equivocal attitude that is both social and egocentric arises . I only affirm that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ artists , whether they happen to be working with speech , which is an instrument of communication , or not . The two things are there together ? the implying of a public and the ignoring of it . The dispute between philosophers of wstheties as to whether art is expression or communication is a mere reflection of this complex mental fact . The dispute will continue , I suppose , until philosophers die , and then some scientific investigator will give us a little light on the real problem ? how and why and in what ways these two attitudes combine . Meanwhile we can at least become convinced of the reality of their combination , and make it fit into a simple picture of human nature , by pointing out how almost universal it is among young children . Jean Piaget ? whose four volumes devoted to child life are one of the great contributions to knowledge in recent years ? has found this twofold attitude so characteristic of children 's speech that he has felt compelled to invent a special term , " collective monologue , " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the other from conversation . When children are together ( M. Piaget tells us ) they seem to talk to each other a great deal more than we do about what they are doing , but for the most part they are only talking to themselves . . . . Each one sticks to his own idea and is satisfied . . . He believes that someone is listening to him , and that is all he wants . . . . He does not succeed in making his audience listen , because , as a matter of fact , he is not really addressing himself to it . He is not speaking to anyone . He is talking aloud to himself in front of others . . . . The audience is there simply as a stimulus . . . . His words haven social function . . . . Nothing could be harder to understand than the notebooks we have filled with the conversation of Pie and Lev . Without full commentaries , taken down at the same time as the children 's remarks , they would be incomprehensible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ demonstrative articles . . . which can mean anything in turn , regardless of the demands of clarity or even of intelligibility . . . In a word the child hardly ever even asks himself whether he has been understood . For him , that goes without saying , for he does not think about others when he talks . He utters " a collective monologue . " . . . To put it quite simply , we may say that the adult thinks socially even when be is alone , and the child under seven thinks egocentrically , even in the society of others . M. Piaget collects specimens of children 's talk the way a naturalist collects butterflies , and he has estimated that forty-five per cent of the spontaneous talk among themselves of average children of seven to eight years is egocentric . It is devoid of the motive of communication . And the reason for this is not that the child has conceived other people and rejected them out of his world , but that he has not clearly conceived what it is to be another person @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A child can not explain anything or even tell a story intelligibly , because he can not realize that others do not know the story . The story is there ? the " telling " is something that he does to it . M. Piaget has demonstrated this fact with a whole series of fascinating experiments , but anyone who is familiar with young children can confirm it , and will realize how much the question we are discussing may be illumined by comparing the enraptured poet to the child . " This way of behaving , " M. Piaget tells us , " reappears in certain men and women of puerile disposition ( certain hysterical subjects , if hysteria be described as the survival of infantile characteristics ) who are in the habit of thinking aloud as though they were talking to themselves , but are also conscious of their audience . " I think this is a too narrow saying , and that M. Piaget has not happened to reflect to how great an extent art depends upon a survival of infantile characteristics . Even the most mature @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his control the attitudes of childhood . He must have a child 's excited interest in the mere being of things , a child 's perceptive freedom , his freedom from habitual attitudes of action , the feeling of achild and a savage that words form a part , and indeed a rich , crude and substantial part , of things . And he must have , too , this gift of returning in rapture to that infantile egocentrism , which is not egocentrism after all because the circumference as well as the center is ego , because , as M. Piaget says , " the whole content of the infant 's consciousness is projected into reality ( both into things and into others ) , which amounts to a complete absence of the consciousness of self . " Without realizing it , I think M. Piaget has enriched the understanding of the lyric rapture with his severely scientific studies of childhood more than all the critics and philosophers who have expatiated upon this theme in their learned essays for two thousand years . And if we return to the " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , we shall realize that what first and essentially characterizes them is not their unintelligibility , but their preoccupation with pure poetry . Their unintelligibility is accidental . It is a result of the fact that they are cultivating life without criticizing it ? just as their intelligibility when they were criticizing life was in a sense accidental . In both eases their singing was often only overheard . But a criticism of life when it is overheard is understood , because it involves that part of the value of words which is a common social possession , their practical meaning . But an individual experience stored away in words , like some sacred unique object or the fragrance of it in a reliquary ? the experience itself having been perhaps more than half or even all composed of the emotional flavors of words ? that is often impossible to overhear . The pure poet ? unless he has in him a vein of rather adult vanity or social kindliness to bring him down out of his collective monologue , and make him , while telling it , tell us also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the long run become a somewhat unintelligible poet . It is the abandonment of interpretation , not of communication , that is fundamental in the modern tendency . In order to explain the flourishing of this tendency , however , the veritable international conquest of power by the Cult of Unintelligibility , we must do more than show why poets write uncommunicative poems . That is the easiest and most gracious part of the task . We must also explain why grown-up and supposedly intellectual and judicious critics peruse these poems that they can not understand a word of , and praise them extravagantly without a blush . The critics themselves have various ways of explaining what it is they enjoy in unintelligible poetry . Mark Van Doren goes so far as to invent a new psychic substance to explain it ? a substance which is intellectual and to be found in the head and yet flows along " somewhere down below " such superficial things as thought and idea and understanding . In eulogizing Hart Crane 's volume , White Buildings , from which we have quoted a poem , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could not understand this volume when he first read it , and then still more frankly adding that he can not understand it now either . Nevertheless , he admires and enjoys it , and insists that it is " intellectual " rather than emotional poetry . " Mr. Crane can hardly be said to think , " he concedes , but nevertheless " he plays in the depths of the head . " The question just what Mr. Crane plays with in that remote quarter ? a thing which is not feeling and yet does not consist of thinking and can not be understood ? Mark Van Doren answers as follows : " Not with ideas as such , for they takeshape only on the surface of thought , on the level where they can be expressed , but with the intellectual lava that flows , sluggishly , irresistibly somewhere down below . " Taking this formula as a guide , we should feel that unintelligible poetry is at least deep , and that in order to get at this cranial substratum we should have to dig down under whatever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the poem . Turning to Allen Tate , however , another of the eulogizers of Hart Crane , we learn that " The poetical meaning is a direct intuition , realized prior to an explicit knowledge of the subject-matter of the poem . " Here the value seems to lie not in a molten lava that lies underneath the poem , but in a rather more gaseous substance that merely clings over the surface of it . The idea is not to delve under what the poet is talking about , but read so fast that what he is talking about ca n't catch you . T. S. Eliot seems to think that this process can move a little more slowly , and that a poem 's subject-matter need not be regarded as inimical , provided you hold your rational faculties in suspense . " The reader , " he says , " has to allow the images to fall into his memory successively without questioning the reasonableness of each at the moment ; so that at the end a total effect is produced . " Coming from one who was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " classical , " and to be characterized by a " higher and clearer conception of Reason , and a more severe and serene control of the emotions by Reason , " this formula for reading a poem he admires greatly seems a little disconcerting . But at any rate it is not sharply out of accord with the formula of Allen Tate . They both make us feel at least that it is awfully easy to read poetry ? all you have to do is to suspend your intelligence and let her go . But no sooner have you reached this happy conclusion than along comes another High Priest of the modernist criticism , Ivor Winters ? another admiring reader of Hart Crane ? and tells us that poetry is a " moral discipline , " and that you can not get the real meat of the thing , the " subjective act , " until you have not only read the poem through , and studied it , and got an explicit knowledge of its subject matter , but also gone and talked it over with your friends . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the non-paraphrasable part of the poetic language , or rather the poem as a whole , after one has done talking about it . " And Mr. Winters is supported in this more arduous view by Herbert Read , who regards " a non-logical progression in poetry as a result of thinking raised to a more than ordinary intensity . ' These professional critics are all eclipsed , however , by C. K. Ogden , who tells us , in his preface to Joyce 's latest installment , Tales of Sheln and Shaun , that in order to adjust our minds to the values of this new kind of literature , what we have to do is learn to talk Eskimo . Joyce , it seems , does not know Eskimo andneither , I infer , does C. K. Ogden ? but Joyce has conscious " affiliations with his Norse ancestors , " and Ogden seems to think that the only way to outwit his unintelligibility is to go " still farther north " and learn a still more difficult language . This geographical approach to literature will become easier , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opened a route under the ice . Meantime Mr. Ogden already knows this much about Eskimo ? he knows that Stefansson knows the language , and has told him that he " regards it as the most difficult but at the same time the most efficient language as yet evolved by man . " It has twenty-seven case forms , nine each in *Not a , direct quotation but a paraphrase in The Symposium , Vol. 1 . No 3 , p. 320. the singular , dual , and plural , and it does n't bother with primitive little equipment like affixes and suffixes , having at its disposal " 164 infixes " with which " over one thousand forms can be made out for one noun alone . " Iglu means " house , " but " iglupakulia " means " the big house which he built for himself and still possesses and which is no longer as good as formerly . " It is obvious that Joyce would have no terrors for an Eskimo . The trouble is that the Eskimos are not greatly interested in modern literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their language ? or the particular dialect , at least , that Ogden recommends . Another trouble is that , according to what Stefansson told Ogden , " it was only after six years of constant study and practice that he attained proficiency in its use . " In view of these facts , Ogden concludes : " At least a decade may be necessary before Mr. Joyce 's ' word-ballet ' yields its secret even to an adjusted mind . " To this it might seem reasonable to add that , inasmuch as Joyce himself does not understand Eskimo or use any of the words out of this language , and the reader has spent this first decade merely in order to get into a proper geographical position and overcome his nervousness in the presence of " infixes " ? it might seem reasonable to grant him a couple more decades to devote to the study of the actual Joyce . indeed , I , for my part , think that after going way up north and talking Eskimo for ten years in order to get into the right longitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " it would show unseemly and unscholarly haste to dash right down to the Tropic of Cancer and plunge into Joyce himself , as though there were no degrees of latitude or stages in the concentration of a symbol . Surely a mind properly consecrated to the process of adjustmeat would not ignore those " Norse ancestors " from whom Joyce really did borrow some words . I would suggest a very gradual southerly movement , about ten degrees to the decade . That would bring you to Paris in time to be buried with an uncut first edition of Work in Progress on your chest and the proud joy in your bones that you died with an adjusted mind . Just how much , and at what , my canny and learned friend Ogden is smiling in his preface to Tales of Sheri. and Shaun , I will not try to determine . Suffice it to say that he locates the values of unintelligible literature somewhere up in the Arctic Circle beyond the reach of the non-Eskimo reader . Mark Van Doren locates them in a warmer region but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lava lying " some-where down below . " Allen Tate locates them in a first whiff that comes off the words before the mind begins to operate ; T. S. Eliot in a last whiff after prolonged suspension of the rational faculties ; Ivor Winters in a " subjective act " that can be performed only after the mind has done its worst ; Herbert Read in a thinking so intense that it transcends logic . To these opinions we may add that of Marcel Brion that it is necessary to " break through the too narrow restraints of time and space , " and of Robert Macalmon that it is necessary " to ' trance ' oneself into a state of word intoxication , flitting-concept inebriation in order to enjoy this work to the full . " Nor should we neglect the more copious if not quite soul-clarifying admonition of Edmund Wilson that " in order to understand what Joyce is doing " in certain parts of Ulysses , " one must conceive a set of Symbolist poems , themselves involving characters whose minds are represented Symbolistically , depending not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ person , but from the poet 's imagination playing a role absolutely impersonal and always imposing on itself all the Naturalistic restrictions in regard to the story it is telling at the same time that it allows itself to exercise all the Symbolistic privileges in regard to the way it tells it . " Where these Doctors of Unintelligibility disagree to that extent , it seems foolhardy for a simple soul who has wasted a large part of his life in the improvement of his understanding to rush in and try to say anything . However , the principal thing I want to say is that they do disagree . They disagree so completely as to what they are getting out of unintelligible literature ? what it is , and where it is , and haw they get it ? that we are practically driven to the conclusion they do not get it at all . They bring it with them . Just as the poet uses a listener , or the idea of a listener , as a mere pretext for speech , so the listener uses the poetry as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all , but merely makes its existence a pretext ? for some art of his own , some inward thought or dwelling upon experience which has a value for him . There is no communication and no demand for communication on either side . But there is an illusion of communication . Both the poet and the critic assume that something passes between them and , being highly egocentric in the mood and during the time which they devote to art , each goes away satisfied from the encounter , and they resent as obtuse or unsensitive or " decadent " or " conventional " or " democratic " or " psychological " or otherwise extremely contemptible and unregenerate the simple questioning of an intelligent mind : " What has actually passed between them ? " and the simple answer : " Nothing . " That this is the true fact of the matter may be illustrated by the example of one of these critics who has been rash enough to come right out and tell us what it was that he got out of a piece of unintelligible literature . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . " says Padraic Colum in his preface to that work . " To myself there comes the recollection of a feeling I had when , as a child , the first time in Dublin I crossed a bridge with an elder of mine beside me . I imagine other children 's minds would have been occupied with such thoughts as occupied mine then . The city ? who named it ? The pavements ? who laid them down ? The statues ? what had the men done that they should claim that men should look upon them now and that men should have looked upon them in one 's father 's and one 's father 's father 's time ? . . . The mystery of beginnings filled the mind . And combining with the questions that came , there were things that had to be noted ? the elder one walked beside . . . the apple one bought and ate and the penny one paid for it , the beggar-woman on the bridge , etc. , etc . . . . " It is clear that this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with Joyce 's little book . He talks , indeed , as though he were holding the book in his hand . But if there is any more compact or causal relation between this sentimental reminiscence of Padraic Cohim 's and Joyce 's six hundred hours of labor burying the names of rivers and other admirable if not very unusual objects in the actual contents of the book , I am unable to find it . Here again we must turn to childhood ? and to M. Piaget , who first brought all the resources of science to the study of childhood ? for an understanding of what happens in this world of art . " It is only from the age of 7 or s ( he tells us ) that there can be any talk of genuine understanding between children . Till then the egocentric factors of verbal expression . . . are all too important . . . . Words spoken are not thought of from the point of view of the person spoken to , and the latter , instead of taking them at their face value @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distorts them in favor of previously formed conceptions . . . . Each child , whether he is trying to explain his own thoughts or to understand those of others , is shut up in his own point of view . . . . Each imagines he is understanding and listening to the others even when he is doing nothing of the kind . .. One of the facts which point most definitely to the egocentric character of the explanations of children is the large proportion of cases in which the explainer completely forgets to name the objects which he is explaining . . In this connection it should be noted that the listener adopts exactly the complementary attitude : he always thinks he has understood everything . However obscure the explanation , he is always satisfied . It needs hardly a word more to make clear the part played by the admiring critic in promoting the Cult of Unintelligibility . His part too is a childlike one . If he is a child under seven or eight years he may actually believe that he understands and go round puffing out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ new methods of writing are merely " direct and vivid , " and that all the talk about not being able to understand them comes from " trying to judge them by standards other than their own . . . " I am quoting from John Dos Passos , but I might be quoting from any one of a hundred men of alert fancy who mistake a stimulation of their own gifts for communication from another . As they grow a little older , a little less " shut up in their own point of view " ? I mean , of course , only in their approach to a work of art ? these critics begin to admit that they do not exactly under-Siang unintelligible writing . But still clinging to the idea that communication has occurred , they east solemnly about for some nonsensical formula like direct intuition in advance of understanding , or cumulative effect after not understanding , or " subjective act " or " molten lava , " or flitting-concept inebriation , or almost anything , to make verbal and grammatical understanding seem unnecessary to communication @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maturity , the critic begins in a half-hearted way to try to understand what the poet is talking about , but still reverently feels in his failure that there is something the matter with him , if only the fact that he has not had the good luck to be born Eskimo . It seems to me that we should be tolerant when poets are too childlike , knowing that to be childlike is an intrinsic part of their creative gift . But for infantilism in critics I do not see that there is a word of defense or apology possible to be spoken . It is hard enough to put up with the moral importance of critics even when they bring to bear in their judgments the most mature psychological and social intelligence available in their time . When they are so little developed , so " shut up in their own point of view , " that they do not know the difference between receiving a communication and making up a fairy story , and so little trained in elementary perception of fact that they go right on attributing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ who has himself convincingly explained to them that his poetry is like all other poetry except that he does not make clear what he is talking about , I do not see what to do with the whole tribe but bundle them into a well-rotted ship and shove them out to sea . No doubt we should long ago have adopted this mode of mitigating the plague of unintelligibility were it not for the fact that a majority of these critics are poets too . That leaves us nothing to do , I am afraid , but smile patiently and turn to the books of science and wait for better days .
