txt Regulating Wall Street . To the Editor of The New York Times : I agree with David L. Saunders that the amount of money required to take care of Wall Street manoeuvres is not very large  --  comparatively . Mr. Dawes calls Wall Street a peanut stand . I agree with that , too . But so is the rest of the world , and when one of the props of a peanut stand becomes wobbly the stand as a whole does not inspire confidence . To change the figure : The stomach is a comparatively small portion of the human body , , , but several miles beyond Sandy Hook , on a choppy day , it seems to become just about all of it . Wall Street has been called the financial stomach of the nation . Well , why not regulate it ? I realize that short selling can not be stopped as long as the sellers can borrow shares of stock from individuals , brokers and trust companies . ALBERT BIGELOW PAINE . New York , April 30 , 1932.    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
