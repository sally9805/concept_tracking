To most Chileans dynamic , blue-eyed , stocky , 70-year-old President Arturo Alessandri , " Lion of Tarapaca , " has represented a political stability of sorts . During his last six years of the Presidency he has nipped all incipient revolts in the bud . Fortnight ago , however , this record was rudely broken when Chilean Nazis , members of the storm-trooping Nacista ( Nazi ) Party , staged a revolt . It lasted four hours . When the shooting stopped , 62 persons were dead . Arrested were Fhrer Jorge Gonzalez von Marees and popular old General Carlos Ibez , a former dictator , who was the Nazis ' Presidential candidate . <P> The " Lion " quickly obtained from the Chilean Congress a four-month grant of extraordinary powers to handle the extremists . All Cabinet members resigned to give the President a free hand , but were later persuaded to hold on to their jobs . By last week , President Alessandri 's police investigators had dug up enough evidence to make the abortive coup d ' tat one of the best documented revolts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alleged financial contributors to the rising . Among them were Santiago 's Ford dealer , Carlos Orrego , and a University student named Mario Perez who had planned to study engineering in the U. S. , had spent his money on guns instead of books . Listed for assassination were Lion Alessandri , his family , Gustavo Ross , rightist candidate for President in next October 's election ( he is supported by the President who can not by Chilean law succeed himself ) , many another rightist leader and editor . <P> The police also reported that their investigations indicated a second uprising was planned by the Nazis , whose real leader , a mysterious Chief " X , " was still at large . While police hunted Chief X and numerous missing Nazi members , the Chilean Congress decided to increase the size of the army , buy modern military equipment .
