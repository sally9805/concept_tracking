An advertising sensation of 1934 was the color photograph of Gentleman Jockey Crawford Burton , twice winner of the dangerous Maryland Hunt Cup , posing in his racing silks as an endorser of Camel cigarets ' recuperative powers . By a horrible mischance , the photograph of Mr. Burton , holding his saddle and girth , reproduced in such a manner that to a prurient or imaginative eye it appeared to show Mr. Burton indecently exposed as only a man could be exposed . <P> When Crawford Burton , who is a stockbroker when not riding , showed up next day at the New York Stock Exchange , he found that its notoriously prurient members had so chosen to interpret his picture . When Mr. Burton entered the Exchange smoking room , he said that scores of brokers began to brandish copies of Collier 's ( one of the first publications to receive and print the advertisement ) and set up such a gibbering that he could execute no orders , went home to seclude himself for days . <P> When the cruel glee of his acquaintances had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more , Broker Burton , who had been ordered by the National Steeplechase &; Hunt Association to turn in his amateur 's license , gave his case , which he believed a likely one for libel damages , to a law firm which retained as trial counsel dapper Attorney Murray Bernays . They prepared to bring suit against the crack Manhattan advertising agency of William Esty &; Co. , R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , makers of Camels , and a long list of publications , headed by Crowell Publishing Co. ' s Collier 's and American Magazine , and including TIME . First suit to get a court decision was against Crowell , asking $75,000 . A U. S. District Court threw this suit out on the ground that the advertisement was " not libelous . " But Justice Learned Hand of the U. S. Circuit Court of Appeals decreed : <P> " The contrast between the drawn and serious face of Mr. Burton and the accompanying fantastic and lewd deformity was so extravagant that ... it made of the plaintiff a preposterously ridiculous spectacle , and the obvious mistake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ plaintiff has been substantially enough ridiculed to be in a position to complain . . . . Possibly anyone who chooses to stir such a controversy in court can not have been very sensitive originally , but that is a consideration for the jury . . . . " <P> Thus given his day in court . Broker Burton last week diffidently but plainly told a jury what his colleagues at the Exchange had said to him about his picture . They had . he said , asked him " how it felt " and " how much he made from renting it out . " When the jury came in , Mr. Burton was not $75,000 but $2,500 richer . Disappointed , his attorneys turned their attention to the case of Burton v. R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co .. which is to start this week with $200,000 asked .
