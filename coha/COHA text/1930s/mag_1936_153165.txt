Since Sinclair Lewis mentions . Rotary and Kiwanis by name in Babbitt , the " Boosters ' Club , " to which George F. Babbitt belonged , was apparently meant to be a local chapter of Lions International . The " Boosters " might also be taken for Civitans , another , though much smaller , businessmen 's organization devoted to songs , luncheons , community service and mutual backscratching . General belief is that the Civitans take in those who can not make the Lions ; the Lions those who do not make Kiwanis ; and Kiwanis those who fail to make Rotary , which is the spiritual father of them all . Last week Rotary assembled in Atlantic City for its 27th annual convention , 10,000 strong . <P> Amid thunderous cheers Rotarians elected as their international president for the coming year a Nashville lawyer named William R. Manier Jr. , who has been an active Rotarian for 20 years . They listened to Amos O. Squire , consulting physician at New York State 's Sing Sing Prison , declare : " Only rarely have I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The Rotarians liked that because they are earnest supporters of boys ' organizations . Then the Rotarians debated and tabled a resolution favoring prompt completion of the Inter-American Highway ( see p. 44 ) , debated and adopted a resolution " expressing interest " in an international language . <P> Real battle of the Atlantic City convention was over Peace . Many a delegate , including China 's Chengting T. Wang , spoke eloquently upon the ill will rampant in the world today . But when the Rotary Club of Barking , England proposed to put the united shoulder of Rotary International behind the wheel of Peace , the convention split . Cried Rotarian Cyril Franklin , a Briton from Hereford : " If Rotary wants to leave its past policy of inspiring individual Rotarians to active support of outside peace movements , we will be playing with fire . If Rotary splits into parties with national points of view , what will be left ? The resolution is full of dynamite-apt to blow up the whole spirit of Rotary fellowship . " <P> Warned Rotarian Archie Palmer of London : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in every paper in the world that Rotary does not care a snap of the fingers about Peace . " Rotarian Palmer was right . Next day 's headlines : <P> ROTARY REJECTS INTERNATIONAL PEACE PROPOSAL . <P> While Rotary debated in Atlantic City last week , Kiwanis met for its 20th annual convention in Washington . No disturbing questions like Peace bothered the Kiwanians . They went to see President Roosevelt , heard about crime from J. Edgar Hoover , listened intently to Author Will Durant ( The Story of Philosophy ) , meditated upon a pronouncement from Editor Merle Thorpe of Nation 's Business that 75% of Government expenditures " fall within the larger definition of boon-doggling . " They endorsed better housing , prevention of traffic accidents and opposition to " vicious " Communistic propaganda . For next year 's president Kiwanis International named Alfred Copeland Callen , head of the mining and metallurgical engineering department at the University of Illinois .
