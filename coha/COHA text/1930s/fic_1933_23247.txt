THE CAT AND THE COBRA A STORY BY A. W. SMITH A FIVE-FOOT cobra is a big one . A six-footer may exist . A seven-footer is unheard of . This , of course , applies to the common cobra . The hamadryad , or King Cobra , is known to exceed twelve feet in length . He is really dangerous because he will attack at sight . The common cobra will not . If he can he slips quietly away unless he thinks he is cornered . Then you will hear what is to nearly all human beings one of the most frightening sounds on earth  --  the hiss of an angry snake . The inhuman " aah , " low and throaty , of an angry mob , the drawn " wheeow " of an approaching shell  --  these sounds are bad enough . But for real blood-freezing paralysis go into a dark bathroom and hear the sudden explosive hiss from the wet cement floor . Perhaps it came from behind the tin bathtub . . . or from the corner under the window .. . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heard the dry whisper of coils across the floor ? The great earthenware chatti in the corner sweating cold water from its porous sides does not sweat as coldly as you . It could not stand more still .

" You may be nonchalant now over gin and bitters . " More gin ? " ? " Thanks " ? " No ice came up on the mail train  --  Sorry . " India is not all cobras , as some people think , but they are common enough  --  even in Calcutta . As a business we used to occupy one of those gloomy fortresses of finance off Clive Street . It was an ancient semiclassical affair of Corinthian columns and deep verandahs . The outside was stucco which grew a green mossy beard every rains . The inside was dark and cool with high ceilings and creaking floors . It was so unpretentious and old-fashioned that only a firm of our respectability and reputation could have risked its credit by occupying it . Not one of us would ever think of changing . We took a great pride in our building  --  it had been ours for a hundred years  --  and we professed to look down on those who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so popular and cost so much . The building was Jones ' domain . As head accountant he was responsible , among other things , for its organization and upkeep , for the hiring and firing of the subordinate staff and for generally making the way smooth for those of us who were solely concerned with making profits . Jones , of course , had no more high office than to see that our actions were properly recorded interms of rupees and annas and pice . His role was more or less automatic , in so far as anything can be said to be automatic in India . He was doubtless a good accountant , but he lacked above all things that sweet nature and supreme tact which is necessary for the easy handling of an Indian staff . He bewildered them . He tried to alter age-old customs . In doing so he was always stubbing his toe . He might just as well have tried to change the multiplication table . Instead of accepting the order of things painstakingly built up on a web of belief and precedent , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the head clerk down to the humblest sweeper , he thought they could be persuaded by the validity of argument . With dogmatic thoroughness he tried to explain that so and so was a better , a shorter , a quicker , and a less laborious way of doing things in short , that it was more efficient . He was met with charming indulgent smiles and ready acquiescence  --  and nothing was done about it . Moreover , he lacked understanding . He could n't see why Rajah Singh , the sepoy , must never be asked to touch a glass of water , or why the waterman must never be told to carry a pair of shoes to be mended , or quite why Shauqat Ali , one of the piece-goods bazaar clerks , would n't move a plate of ham sandwiches . ( Jones often had meals in the office  --  disgusting habit , but Efficiency was his watchword . ) All these things merely caused Jones to lose his temper , which did n't do a bit of good . By degrees he learned better @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ always something to send Jones into a fit of inarticulate rage . For instance , one day he took it into his head to go over the pay sheet . He checked it with a blue pencil , name by name , all the way from Ahmed Ali , Chittagonian driver of the office car , past the Bannerjis and Mukerjis , down to Xavier and Zachariah , the Indian Christian wharf clerks . At the very bottom of the pay roll Jones discovered  --  Cats two  --  one rupee each . He hammered his bell . The cashier was quite undisturbed . " And why not ? ? " he asked in effect . Ever since Wilson Sahib 's time there had always been two cats on the pay roll . First there had been only one and then two . Now Wilson Sahib had retired somewhere back in the early nineties . Jones had met him in London  --  an elderly man in the middle eighties . " But why ? ? " Jones almost frothed at the mouth . " For forty years two rupees a month  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was the Sahib 's order , " purred the cashier . Jones instituted an inquiry into the status of the office cats . " I will make immediate inquisition , " said the cashier . " Not emolument for cats two , your honor , " said the cashier later , " but subsistence allowance at rupees one per mensem per capita . How can cat get the salary , notwithstanding ? " He smiled gently at the whimsy . Jones found his smile particularly infuriating . " I do n't believe there are any cats , " he said resentfully . " It 's just another ramp . It simply means that the sweeper or someone gets two rupees a month extra because once someone was fool enough ? " " Wilson Sahib 's order , your honor , " said the cashier reprovingly , " but I will bring ? " In due course he brought  --  two meager gray cats who struggled in the arms of the head sweeper and his assistant and swore volubly when Jones was rash enough to put out a hand . The head @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had never bothered to learn any language but his own . " That is senior cat  --  ten years ' service , your honor , " translated the cashier . " Sweeper say please he must have more subsistence . The old age draws on and it cat must get milk , the bowls one per diem . " " Oh , shut up , " said Jones . " I 'm going to sack both . We ca n't have cats , of all things , on the pay roll  --  what with economy and jute prices and everything . " " But Wilson Sahib 's order , " protested the cashier , who could not connect jute with cats . " Blow Wilson Sahib , " said Jones . With a lordly sweep of his blue pencil he struck the cats , two , senior and junior , from the pay roll . Our building was old . It dated back to the eighteen twenties , to the palmy days of indigo and opium , when a fortune might be turned on a cargo . Into it poured rats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ partition tops and swizzled their noses at us from the dusk of corners . There were great gray scarred veterans who seemed to prefer a simple diet of paper and electric-light cords to the fat living of the docks and sewers . There were little brown tiddlers who nested in the cotton and jute samples . We complained one at a time and all together , but on the subject of cats Jones was adamant . " Ridiculous , " he said . " Two rupees a month for cats  --  I ask you ? " He spent untold gold on traps and poison . He bought parched corn for bait by the sack load  --  enough to feed not only the whole corps of sweepers but the waterman also and the water-man 's son , the godown staff , the driver of the office car and the man who sold betel nut and pan leaves at the bottom of the stairs . There were queer smells in dark cupboards  --  rotten cheesy fish smells . " Jones Sahib , " explained the sepoys with a knowing leer . But to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the great calfskin ledgers which it took two strong men to lift . It was too much . Every plague of overpopulation is followed by its natural antidote . A sepoy was sent down the rickety stairs to the jute sample room . He was a portly and dignified figure in his smart blue uniform and scarlet pugri . He did not hurry , nor yet did he dawdle . He descended with measured stride , head up , well-brushed beard fluffed up to his ears . He came up the stairs again in headlong flight . He had seen a fine cobra , he gibbered , playing with its tail at the bottom of the stairs . He positively refused to go down again . " Nag ? " the word spread round the office like wildfire . The little clerks at their desks looked suspiciously at the floor . They hitched their bare toes more securely round the legs of their stools . " Oh , yes  --  a cobra ? " said the head sweeper cheerfully . " He guards the stairs  --  ever since the cats went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more . I 've seen it many times . It 's so long ? " He indicated a strip of floor about fifteen or twenty feet to the wall . " Nonsense , " said Jones who was busy investigating the claims of a new kind of poison . " A cobra in the middle of Calcutta ? Nonsense . " It did look odd with the tramcars clanging in the street and a row of taxis on the opposite corner . " Nonsense , " said Jones firmly . But where there are rats there will be cobras , fulfilling the law of supply and demand . The office staff definitely refused to go up and down those stairs . They were perfectly good-natured about it and no amount of bullying by Jones made the least difference . To get at the samples we had to send a man all the way round by the street and in at the back door . It was a tedious process , but we accepted it , as one does in India , until the senior partner . . . He sent for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " about the office being full of cobras ? " " Oh , nothing , " said Jones a little uneasily . " Just a yarn . " " Well , everybody 's complaining . You 'd better do something about them  --  catch them or get the men to work properly  --  I do n't care which . That 's what you 're here for . " Jones sent for the cashier . " Kill it ? " said the cashier in horror . " But your honor ? " he lowered his voice to a whisper ? " the snake is holy  --  Our Lord Krishna , your honor , " " Well , get rid of it , " said Jones testily . " As your honor wills , " said the cashier . " I have the friend in Kuccha Bazaar who is very holy man . A snake catcher . For two rupees the cash money he will catch ? " " Fetch him , " rapped Jones . Jones found most of the office staff gathered at the foot of the stairs . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that when a man died without an heir his soul returned in the form of a cobra . Did n't everyone know the supreme importance of getting himself a son ? Are n't cobras holy ? Well then There was an air of tension . Everyone felt that something exciting was going to happen . No one knew quite what . In the hot dusty dark among the packing cases and the pillars supporting the building it was pleasantly mysterious . " Have n't any of these people got any work to do ? " snapped Jones . " Go away  --  Jao ? " There was a shifting of feet , a shuffling of faces , a pretense of obeying the order . No one actually went . Jones decided to ignore his audience . There was a ripple in the crowd and a little sigh went up . " Are you the snake catcher ? " asked Jones . The newcomer walked past Jones as if he had n't seen him . He settled himself comfortably on his heels and lighted a green bidi . He sucked in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't the snake catcher  --  only someone from outside who had heard that there was free entertainment to be had . The crowd squatted on its heels , chatting . The show was free . Who mew but that it might n't be surprising . Jones grew impatient . " He comes , your honor , " murmured the cashier soothingly . " He sees if the hour is auspicious . " Upstairs all work seemed to be over for the day . " He comes , " said someone . A hush fell . The silence was broken by the sudden outcry of the small son of a friend of the head sweeper . Dressed up in a round embroidered cap and a heartshaped silver amulet , he had been brought to see the show . He bellowed , rubbing his small fists in his eyes . " Aiee  --  bawa sahib  --  durro mutdurre mut  --  Hush thee , princeling , do n't fear ? " said the father , looking round proudly , hoping that everyone had seen his son and heir . " See the fat sahib @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from his lips and smoke and serpents will come forth . " " Chop tun . Shut up you , " said the cashier rudely from a safe and lordly eminence on top of a packing case . " Ai , babuii , " said the head sweeper . " Oh , come , sir clerk  --  the fat sahib lacks understanding , and it is but speech to a child . " Jones found the big black eyes of the infant fastened on him . Their earnestness embarrassed him . He stamped the floor impatiently . Again quiet . The snake catcher with due regard for the effect of his entrance , came slowly down the stairs , step by step . He made a deep salaam . Jones replied with an indeterminate kind of salute , rather an awkward gesture which was supposed to be one of condescension . " Salaam , huzoor , " said the snake catcher . " Good morning , " said Jones . " It 's a fine day , is n't it ? " When this remark had been translated by the cashier @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fact was sufficiently evident . " Why does the fat sahib say that the sun shines ? " piped the small son of the head sweeper 's friend . " It is the way of sahibs , " said the head sweeper heavily . " As we say Ram Ram '  - -  so they say ' the day has well dawned . ' They find it auspicious no matter whether it is hot or wet or cold . " " Let 's get on with it ? " commanded Jones briskly . " First , your honor , " said the cashier , " first he do the puja . He very holy man . He must have money . " The crowd craned its necks as a silver rupee was handed over . This looked like big business . Money was being spent like water for their entertainment . Their whispering ceased as the snake catcher , seated crosslegged on the stone floor , erected copper coins and some pan leaves in a little pile be-fore him . He drew diagrams , triangles and circles in the dust with a bit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That stick , " whispered the cashier , " that iron stick very holy . " To Jones it looked like a simple piece of jute baling but he hesitated to say so . The cashier wriggled his bare toes apprehensively . With a quick movement the holy man rose to his feet pointing dramatically with his rusty iron at a crevice in a dim corner under the stairs . Certain of his audience , he walked across the floor . He began to probe between the blocks of stone . The crowd sighed a deep " Aah ? " . Even Jones was a little impressed . The holy stick was doing its work . Immediately there issued from the crevice a loud and angry hiss . It sent the watching crowd pressing back into the dusky recesses of the basement . Jones felt the hair rise on the back of his neck . He shared in common with the rest a general distrust of snakes . He wondered whether it would be dignified to retire a step or two up the stairs . He hardly had time to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ itself like a whiplash across the smooth stone floor . Quick as light but quicker still the holy snake catcher made a leap for the stair- case . And the crowd found points of security on packing eases and bales of cotton . To Jones was left the sole possession of the floor . Somewhat bewildered the cobra coiled . It raised a hooded head , barring Jones ' exit to safety up the stairs . " Stand still , your honor , stand still , " admonished the cashier . Jones needed no warning . Horrorstruck he watched the swaying head  --  a blunt thimbieshaped object standing out from the distended hood . He did.not dare move . He squinted down his nose in a painful effort to see . " Lathi lap , " cried the cashier . " Bring a stick . " " Lathi lao  --  maro maro , " " Bring a stick and strike , strike , " echoed the crowd . The holiness of the cobra was forgotten . " What is the fat sahib doing ? " asked the infant son of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said his father . " Did he spit that ? " asked the childish voice . Jones stood . He was fiercely conscious of ankles and lower legs . He wondered whether , as he had heard , a pair of trousers was enough to stop the poison . And would it hurt ? Through long tense seconds they eyed each other  --  when , from somewhere in the dark , crept the senior cat . He was light gray , thin and motheaten . Ears flattened to his head , body flattened to the floor , he slid , experienced warrior that he was , with stealthy stride . The Indian cat is not like any other cat . The hand of man is more than usually turned against him . He is about as strokeable as a porcupine , and the snake is a traditional enemy . The senior cat crept crouching past Jones ' legs . The tip of his mangy tail flicked convulsively . It was this which caught the cobra 's eye . His weaving head changed its direction . It increased in speed . Jones @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the senior cat . The cobra struck . In that split second a lot of things happened . The cat leaped lightly to land over the cobra 's back . And Jones  --  Jones displayed an agility of which those who knew him best could hardly believe him capable . In one standing jump he landed about five steps up the stairs . The son of the sweeper 's friend crowed in delight , but the crowd was too intent on the senior cat 's battle to notice Jones , Each time the cobra struck the senior cat jumped . To one side , to the other side  --  or merely straight up in the air so that the snake shot beneath him . Each time he jumped he dealt a vicious blow with clawed forepaw . After each attack the cobra whirled round to sit up on his coiled body , head swaying , hood extended , forked tongue flicking , and the senior cat crouched low to the floor , still but for the convulsive flicking of his tail . His growls were horrible . Again the cobra @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ senior cat leaped high , only to whirl around in midair . He dropped with all four feet extended , biting just where the head joined the spectacled hood . For a moment snake and cat lashed about the floor . The cat jumped clear . He left his enemy writhing . For the cobra that was the end . The senior cat paraded stealthily round his victim . He waited only for a chance to close . Jones mopped his brow . Fascinated , he watched the senior cat . It was time now for the junior cat . With skill she sprang from behind a pillar . It was the turn , too , of Rajah Singh Sepoy , burly Rajputani from the fighting races of Lucknow . Black beard brushed up fiercely to his ears , waving a heavy bamboo lathi , he leaped into the arena . " Hut jao , biiii  --  Out of the way , cat ? " he cried . " Shabash , maro , 111t1T0- " " Well done , lay on , lay on ? " chanted the crowd . Rajah @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ struck sparks from the floor . The dust flew . The cobra was dead . The senior and the junior cat faded like lean gray shadows . Of course , you may say it was a put-up job . If the cats were there all the time . . . you see what I mean . Possibly . This doubtless occurred to Jones who was always suspicious of human nature . He debated the question for a whole afternoon before signing a voucher for reinstatement of the cats and incidental expenses . ( To cash  --  holy man for finding one cobra serpent . . . et cetera . ) Jones also sacked the head sweeper . You see , one of his visitors during the afternoon was a dirty dishevelled gentleman who forced himself into Jones ' office . He claimed to be the head sweeper 's caste brother . He claimed also that he had not been paid . He demanded to be paid . He presented , in fact , a dirty bill , for one fine cobra from which the poison fangs had been removed .  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
