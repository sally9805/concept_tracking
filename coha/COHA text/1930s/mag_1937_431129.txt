WE PROBABLY never would have thought of borrowing a playmate for Fran last summer if she had not been so miserably lonely that previous vacation in the country . In the city she was quite content with her little coterie of friends , but these she had been unable to duplicate at the shore . The result was that as the summer wore on she became restless and fidgety and almost drove her mother frantic with " Mom , what 'll I do ? " Thinking over the problem , her mother finally decided on a plan . Since Fran needed a congenial playmate to make her summer tolerable , why not borrow one ? There should be plenty of youngsters available in the homes and orphanages about the city , children who would be overjoyed at the chance of getting away for a while . Some months before we trekked shoreward last summer , Fran 's mother asked a social-service worker whom she knew if arrangements for taking a child from one of the homes could be made . Well , came the answer , the request @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was . One afternoon three freshly starched misses from the Brooklyn Home for Children came to call on Fran , play with her , and give her an opportunity of expressing , unknown to them , a preference in playmates . When they left , Fran made a first and second choice . So her mother asked the director at the home which of the two would be better suited temperamentally to Fran , who is high-strung and nervous . The director suggested Kay as being calm and placid . So Kay it was . When we went to the country last year , Kay came along , equipped with a full wardrobe provided by the home . What a difference her presence made ! Fran not only put in one of the happiest and most healthful summers of her life , but Kay wrought sundry changes in her , by precept and example conditioning her to a more patient , tolerant , and unselfish life . The whole thing worked out so well for us that a number of our friends are planning on enlarging their families this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is inclined to be sickly said : " Why did n't I think of that before ? I do believe Robert 's main trouble is loneliness . " The first thing we impressed on Fran was the necessity for equal rights . Kay was to enjoy the same privileges as 92 Fran , just as if she were our own child . Overjoyed at the prospect of having a constant companion , Fran readily agreed to the equal-rights bill , although she did not realize then what personal readjustments would be necessary . Fran is a boisterous blonde , normal in most respects , although nervous and temperamental . Even with the best intentions , we probably spoiled her ; she was inclined to be selfish , since she was the only child until Buddy came along five years later . Kay is a raven-locked little tyke , not so tall as Fran , although two years older , but sturdy , well built , and athletically inclined . Fran 's first reaction to Kay was one of jealousy . Coming from a common community of 300 children where all are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lacking , Kay was starved for affection and lavished it on us freely . Fran watched us being smothered with hugs and kisses and began accusing us of loving Kay more than her . To which her mother would reply reassuringly : But was n't there room in her heart for Kay , too ? And if Fran were ever motherless , would n't she like some one to love her ? Fran admitted she would . The result was that Fran soon accepted the situation and became demonstratively affectionate , too . At first Kay was inclined to consider an excessive amount of teasing from Fran as inevitable . But " Mother " eventually persuaded her to take her own part . Fran treated Kay thereafter with more respect . In the matter of adjusting differences , Mother devised a formula which worked . After a set-to both of them would run to her , each blaming the other . Mother refused to listen to either but immediately sent both children to different rooms upstairs for an hour or so . This sort of thing grew less and less frequent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the two , and they soon became as inseparable as Siamese twins . Kay developed various salutary traits in her playmate . Accustomed to making her own bed , Kay naturally continued after she came with us . Fran , who had never made a bed before in her life , watched these ministrations at first with curious interest , and eventually was lending a hand . Kay was also given to putting everything in its place , and Fran was soon following suit . She was not going to have Kay get more praise for orderliness than she . Then again , Fran was picky and : choosey in her diet , eating what she particularly liked and having to be coaxed to eat the rest . Kay also had her aversions , but she was so grateful for everything we did she made heroic attempts at eating her portions , albeit with huge forkfuls as if to get it over with soon . Her gameness drew applause from us . Fran , not to be outdone , began calling attention to her own clean plate . Kay was also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ She was somewhat better as a swimmer than Fran and had picked up a crude bu serviceable overhand stroke . Fran envied this stroke , began trying for and after repeated efforts made it . She was as proud of this achievement as the doctor of the Dionnes , but without Kay 's incentive she might not have , been so interested . Then the two oC them added diving to their accomplish- I ments . One incident which pleased us grew out of the occasion of Kay 's birthday party , her first . Some of our friends responded with presents for Kay , and we gave her a doll . Fran resented this doll from the first and contended that she should have received one , too . A few days later , during a somewhat heated altercation , Kay picked up one of Fran 's old dolls and threatened to throw it . In the scramble the arms parted company with the body , al tragedy which plunged Fran into a spasm of grief . Seeing that Fran was not to be consoled , Kay finally said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you my new dolly for the one I broke . " Instinctively recognizing the magnanimity of this gesture , Fran put her arm around her friend and said , " No , Kay , I could n't take your dolly . " We felt that Fran was beginning to learn some of the subtleties of human relationship that she may need later on . Our chief hope for our children is to send them out into the world equipped to get along with their fellows . I believe that faculty is as important as education . For without it , the possessor of mere knowledge is severely handicapped . And what of Kay ? Friends have repeatedly voiced some apprehension of this experiment by asking what happens to a child given a taste of private home  | lire and then returned to an institution . Here 's the way it worked out . We have all grown very fond of Kay and have been having her at home with us nearly every week-end since returning from the country . These are her bright spots , to be looked forward to . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kay , and Fran has a life-long friend . Of course she is coming with us again this summer . When I first spoke to the editor of GOOD HOUSEKEEPING about starting a movement to find playmates for lonely children , he asked if 100,000 children would be available for the plan , believing there would be a call for at least that many , and if the directors of children 's homes in general were amenable to the idea . According to the 1930 census , there are some 300,000 children being cared for in the United States under public and private auspices . There must be many more at the present time . Of some 1600 institutions then , 50 percent were sectarian , 32 percent nonsectarian , and 6 percent fraternal  | Borrowed Playmates Children 's homes are located mostly ' proximity with cities . Not all the child . are orphans ; some are half orphans v . r a mother or father living , and some ha both parents living . I went to those in charge of a num of children 's homes in New @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had great possibilities if properly ministered . " It would be a godsend , " said one tron , " if the right people , those who a. sympathetic and understanding , wen voluntarily act as foster parents to eh children , take them into their homes oc sionally for holidays , week-ends , for summer ? love them or just show an terest in them . They do miss a parer. love frightfully . " I have been here over twenty yea she went on , " and yet am always wee and sad on such days as Thanksgiving Christmas . I 'm sad because of the child who are left here in the home . They can understand why . They see other children going out to a mother , a father , or friends . Maybe they have parents who have forgotten them , and the eager way they wail for word up to the last minute is some- , thing I can never forget . " This matron told about overhearing two boys , one of whom had gone to his father for Thanksgiving , the other @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Bet'cha wished yu was here , " said the latter . " We had a lotta fun , a turkey ? all yu cud eat . Wha'ju have ? " The other hesitated , then replied , " A balony sandwich , but ? " with a note of triumph ? " I was with my father . " There was no more to be said , since it is generally conceded that a father is by far preferable , even though going to one means only a Bologna sandwich for Thanksgiving dinner . IN VISITING the summer quarters of the Brooklyn Home for Children , I was particularly impressed with the way the . little tots especially crowd around you . wanting to take your hand , to touch you And I recall how proudly one tousled head looked up at me and said , " I 've got a daddy . " It 's an insatiable hunger these youngsters have for some one to love , some one they can call Dad or Mother . I never realized what this need means until ' I came in contact @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ came to us , she was abnormal in this respe-t. and quite embarrassed us with her profu= e embraces . But after having this want fulfilled , she gradually became more like a normal child . Parents can supply this fundamental need in their own children . but institutions can not . On the other hand , the latter can and do inculcate in their charges obedience to discipline and other habits that are useful in facing life . The institution child follows a regular routine . He does everything in its proper time and place like a soldier living in barracks . In fact , the orderly rows of little cots recalled my army days and the routine of army life . Also the grand sense of freedom you get with leave . The first several weeks of our stay in the country found Kay of a morning up in he ! . room , putting her things in drawers and taking them out , arranging and rearranging them . Repeated calls from Fran to come out and play were disregarded . We did not understand this apparently queer behavior @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her newfound freedom , " she said . " For the first time she was experiencing the joy of going to her own room when she liked and doing what she pleased with her things . "  | A nonconformist in an institution soon : earns by having some desirable privileges withheld that good behavior is the best policy . He learns to give and take , to await his turn , to play fair in games . There are no artificial superiorities for him to flaunt , such as money and social position sometimes give . He does not have his own mother to run to , to complain of real or imagined wrongs . Deprived of these , he falls back on his own resources . All of which is training that is useful in many respects . My parents sent me to a military school to get it . Unfortunately such training is difficult to give in a private home , especially when there is only one child . And so bringing in an institution-trained child will sometimes help . As for Kay , she supplied something @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It looked like a good exchange all around , and I believe it will work out that way as a general thing . If you are considering the plan , which has nothing : 3 do with adoption beyond being a possible prelude , here are some hints ! Get the approval first of a social-service worker or superintendent of a home . If there are no institutions near you , there are certainly some underprivileged children . Secure the preference of your own child , if possible without its being apparent to the others . A playmate one or two years older than your child may be desirable . Our reason for giving the visitor the advantage of age was to lessen the chances of her being completely dominated by our youngster . We feel that institution children have had enough unhappiness without inviting a situation that might cause more . I can not speak for all institutions , but with us , the home assumed full responsibility in case of accident . Of course it was understood we take good care of the child . In following through @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some child less fortunate than your own and of giving him a feeling that he really belongs . You will probably find two occupied children less wearing on the nerves than one who is unoccupied . At least , Mother did . In all probability you will find the disciplinary problem a minor one , since the borrowed playmate will inevitably be so grateful for your generosity he will do his best to please . You may find that the visitor will even help develop various salutary traits in your own child . Anyway , your child will have a competitive element . And not the least advantage is that you will surely get some thrills out of the experience yourself . It will be a new experience , provided you have not done it , to look up an orphanage in your community . If you have any interest in children , you will be fascinated and touched , touched with the wistful eagerness on those little faces . What will pull at your heart especially is the way the tots crowd around and cling to you . Many of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Or what is worse , they have parents who have deliberately forgotten them . Just try to realize what this means to them . No wonder they are so starved far love and look up at you so eagerly and searchingly , as if you might conceivably supply this need ! Perhaps you might . As for myself , I always leave such a place feeling I would like to take the whole bunch home with me . Well , Buddy will be three this summer and just about old enough to have a boy playmate .  |
