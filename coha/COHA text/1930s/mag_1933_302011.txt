Statesmen of small countries have to do undignified things . Last week small Austria 's minuscule Chancellor Engelbert Dollfuss ( he is less than five feet tall ) flew to the Adriatic beach resort of Riccione for a conference with Premier Benito Mussolini , found him swimming offshore and disinclined to come in . For Chancellor Dollfuss to have waited abjectly on the beach would have been too undignified . He hired a small skiff , rowed out to where Il Duce was floating on his back . <P> After a few words of greeting , Dictator Mussolini grabbed the edge of the skiff which teetered dangerously as he pulled himself aboard , sat down sopping at the tiller while Chancellor Dollfuss rowed the skiff out of earshot of plebeian bathers . During their rowboat conference the two statesmen undoubtedly discussed : 1 ) the **26;11472;TOOLONG trade pact negotiated by Il Duce and Premier Julius Gmbs in Rome ( TIME , Aug. 7 ) ; 2 ) the fact that anti-Dollfuss propaganda was again being broadcast to Austria from German radio stations last week , despite the Hitler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cease ( TIME , Aug. 21 ) ; and 3 ) the general question of whether Italy will support Chancellor Dollfuss in his efforts to prevent a Nazi coup and union of Austria with Germany . Returning to shore , Rower Dollfuss and Steersman Mussolini were cheered good-humoredly by hundreds of Italian bathers on the beach . <P> After a further conference at Riccione 's Grand Hotel the two statesmen issued a communiqu from which it was clear that Chancellor Dollfuss agreed to Il Duce 's plans for an Italo-Austrian-Hungarian bloc in return for Italian support of his regime . " Austrian independence " was laid down as a " basic principle " by Chancellor Dollfuss , according to the communiqu and both statesmen " perceived that there exists between them a common identity of ideas regarding the problems examined . " <P> Broadcasting from Munich that same night , Chancellor Hitler 's chief anti-Dollfuss propagandist , Nazi Theodor Habicht , roared : " There can be no peace and stability in Europe until Germany and Austria are united !
