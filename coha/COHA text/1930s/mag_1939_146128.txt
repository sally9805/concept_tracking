It was the year everyone was fascinated by a new craze called crossword puzzles - Jack Dempsey was World 's Heavyweight Champion , What Price Glory was playing on Broadway , and Ty Cobb was still in his prime - when Manager Miller Huggins of the New York Yankees , one fine day in June 1925 , stepped up to a clumsy , rosy-cheeked rookie his scouts had picked up on the Columbia campus . " Gehrig , " he muttered , " you take Wally Pipp 's place at first base today . " Last week , for the first time since that faraway day , the Yankees started a game without Lou Gehrig . <P> In those 14 years , milk-drinking , early-to-bed Lou Gehrig , son of a German-born Manhattan janitor , became famed as Base ball 's Iron Horse . He played in 2,130 consecutive games ( besides seven World Series and hundreds of exhibition games ) -a record that no baseballer has ever approached or perhaps ever will. * Far more important than his record for durability , however , is Gehrig 's batting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more a year for 13 years ) , 2,721 hits ( 1,192 of them for extra bases ) , 1,886 runs ( including 494 home runs ) , a lifetime batting average of .341 . His record of 23 home runs with bases loaded surpasses even that of famed Babe Ruth . <P> In those 14 years , earnest , honest Lou Gehrig , the sort of player managers dream about , made a fetish of his endurance record . Eclipsed by his colorful , temperamental teammate Babe Ruth , plodding Lou Gehrig felt that his drawing power was his dependability rather than his brilliance . When , at spring training camp this year , the Iron Horse suddenly realized that he was getting rusty , panic overtook him . He brooded , became tense at bat . Sportswriters , viewing his feeble performance , wrote his batting obituary-for all the world to read - before the season started . <P> Last week the mental strain was more than sensitive Yankee Gehrig could bear . The highest-salaried ( $34,000 a year ) baseballer in the major leagues had succeeded in getting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first eight games of the season . Every time he went to bat he felt that all the baseball fans in the world could hear him creak . When he got a hit he ran as though there were lead in his shoes . He missed low throws and grounders . Convinced that he was a hindrance rather than a help to his team , 35-year-old Lou Gehrig last week asked Manager Joe McCarthy to remove him from the Yankee lineup . <P> Sitting on the bench in Detroit 's Briggs Stadium , Gehrig ( known as Buster to his teammates ) blubbered as he watched Babe Dahlgren take over his old stamping ground at first base , then silently watched his buddies hand the Tigers their worst defeat ( 22-10-2 ) in 27 years. * He graciously shook hands with young Dahlgren after the game , but the only Yankee who dared try to console him was Pitcher Lefty Gomez . " Hell , Lou . " said Lefty , " it took 15 years to get you out of the game ; sometimes I 'm out in 15 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was Wally Pipp , now a Grand Rapids ( Mich. ) businessman . " I know just how he feels , " said Mr. Pipp . <P>
