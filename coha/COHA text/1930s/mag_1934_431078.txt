I HAVE two friends who , whenever the subject of cosmetics comes up , get into ar argument . It burdens one that the women of this country spend nearly two billion a year on her pet aversion . " Two billion a year ! " she exclaims . " Vhat of it ? " says the other . And then they are at it . I wonder if the subject of cosmetics has n't divided women for thousands of years . Perhaps not in savage or half-civilized times , when paint and oil were ceremonial and therefore tribally compulsory , but among civilized people where ointment was part of the trade of the professional beauty , and so to be publicly decried , though perhaps secretly envied , by women whom personal inclination or the vigilance of fathers or husbands had kept virtuous . Times , however , have changed . The woman who to-day does not use cosmetics is , for the first time in the history of the world , in the minority . She it is who is now on the defensive . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ war women spent only one fifth of the sum they now spend on beautifying agents . Fashion undoubtedly is partly responsible . Rouge and lipstick were made respectable , and permanents and bobbed hair came into being . And prosperity ( before the Break ) made it easily possible for every woman to indulge . There was none too poor . Factory workers , maids , waitresses , basement store clerks , teachers , professional and business women , women of wealth all invested in artificial beauty aids . But it is something more than vanity these times that is making women keep on spending such huge sums in beauty shops . If it were only vanity , then the chances are that the total spent in 1931 would be much less than the two billion spent in 1930 , and the sum in 1932 would be much less than in 1931 . But there has been no great drop . The cosmetic industry of all the great industries is the one that has most nearly held its own . In 1929 we spent $1,56o , - 000,000 on movies ; @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The automobile industry decreased from 3,355,986 cars sold in 1930 to 2,389,738 cars in 1931 , with a rise in sales now first apparent . Even our per capita consumption of sugar has dropped from io8 pounds in 1929 to 93 pounds in 1932 . The women of this country can curtail their wants when they need to . And if it were only vanity , then it would be the young women who spent most on beauty aids . But most young women , except those that have acne , usually do their own beautifying ; powder and lipstick are their principal investments , and both are comparatively inexpensive . No , the chief props of the beauty business are the middle-aged and the older women . The appearance of youth has become an economic and social necessity . A woman who feels she is aging and does n't dare show it , because she is fearful of losing either her job or her husband or her standing with her friends or her own morale , is the best customer the beauty shop has . SKIN-DEEP - BUT IMPORTANT WHAT @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? It 's not her hair , even if it 's graying . It 's the condition of her skin . So it 's not surprising that it 's the skin that gets the major share of the beauty expenditure . Two or three years ago an official of a cosmetologists ' association gained a good deal of journalistic attention by making the public statement that a woman should spend at least $307 a year on her beauty treatments . The itemized list credited $77 of that sum to the needs of the hair ; $19.50 to manicures ; $39 to lipsticks , rouge , and eyebrow plucks and dyes ; and the balance , $171.50 , much more than half , to the care of the skin . That $171.50 allowed for one facial a week at $2.50 each ; four jars each of cleansing cream , tissue cream , and astringent ; three jars each of skin food and muscle oil ; and three boxes of face powder . It was a moderate statement of the amount a woman who is fearful of showing her age spent at that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The woman who does not have to watch pennies often runs up a bill of several hundred a month at her beauty shop , and it is she who pays from $25 to $200 a small jar for imported special creams that are supposed to have magic powers of rejuvenation . And it is she who has her face lifted again and again at $1,000 per lift . Here are some other figures . In one year American women put on their skins 52,500 tons of cleansing cream , 26,25o tons of skin lotion , 19,109 tons of complexion soap , 17,500 tons of nourishing cream , and 2,375 tons of rouge . The purpose of this article is not to ask whether women should or should not spend around two billion a year on beauty . But it is to ask : Are they getting two billion dollars ' worth ? Or rather : Are they getting the worth of that part of the two billion that they are spending on their skins ? We have no quarrel with the prices the beauty shops charge . No manufacturer has a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beauty shops , so the law of supply and demand should have every chance of applying . But all the cosmetic companies ? I 'll qualify that to " most " cosmetic companies , since I do n't want to get into any libel suits ? claim that their creams smooth out wrinkles , rejuvenate the skin , and all that . I wo n't take space to quote . Simply read any past or current advertisement to learn their hopeful claims . And the question comes : Do they make good in their claims ? Do all these creams and astringents and skin foods and facial treatments really benefit the skin ? The obvious and sorrowful answer is , " No . " We can use our own eyes to prove it . You have but to look at the skin of the woman who spends hours and dollars on her complexion and at the skin of a woman of the same age who does n't apply anything but soap and water , to see that the skin of the first is actually no better than the skin of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrinkled skin with wrinkled skin ; pouchy skin with pouchy skin ; large-pored skin with large-pored skin . If anything , the beauty-parlor skin will have , in addition to its other deficiencies , a more " worked " look . The dermatologists back up the proof of our eyes with the statement that while any fat lubricates the surface of a dry skin and so softens it and makes it more supple , there is no fat that feeds the skin . According to Dr. William Allen Pusey , a leading dermatologist , in his Care of the Skin and Hair : There is practically no absorption of fats which are simply placed in contact with the skin , but with friction fats may be made to penetrate the skin through the sebaceous glands . This fact is made use of in the administration of certain medicines , but it is of no significance in connection with the vain attempts to fill out the skin by rubbing fats into it . Such fat when rubbed in does not take its place beside the skin fat and remain there , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ assimilated by the proper organs , just as though it had been eaten and passed into the blood from the intestines . The same dermatologist says that massage , it long continued , does more harm than good , as it tends to macerate the fat under the skin . Steaming and clay packing are of no benefit , either . The skin survives such treatment , says Dr. Pusey , simply because it is a very tolerant tissue ; while another skin expert , Dr. Charles F. Pabst , says , " The American woman treats her skin as if it were a door mat . " Not a doctor has anything good to say for skin lifting or skin peeling . There is no gainsaying that a woman gets a relaxed look to her skin after a beauty treatment . Women are not fools that they will spend billions on nothing . But the dermatologists and our own eyes tell us the effect is simply transitory . In fact the dermatologists say that the beautifying is more in the mental attitude of the patient than in the physiological change @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will make her look less tired ; the passing of hands over the face is soothing to taut nerves ; there is skillful application of powder and rouge . ( By the way , the dermatologists have nothing against powder and rouge , providing they meet the requirements of the Food and Drug Act . ) The hair is fashionably arranged . Net result : The woman comes out with the conviction that she ca n't look any better than she does . And with that conviction , she has a happy social evening or the courage to hold her own in a difficult business meeting . That of course is a whole lot . Those few hours of morale are worth the price , she figures . But next morning : sagged skin again ; wrinkles . The whole costly job to be done over for another occasion . Now the fundamental question : Might it not be possible for modern science to discover some way by which real physiological help can be given to the skin ? So that the complexions of middle-aged and older persons can be kept @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an increasingly longer span of life . Ca n't science keep our faces younger for a longer part of that time ? SCIENCE ANALYZES CLEOPATRA I HAVE A notion that the glamorous tales of Helen of Troy and Cleopatra have had a most deterrent effect upon the investigative instincts of cosmetologists . Women have been told down through the ages that these storied ladies had most ravishing beauty , and so women down through the ages have believed in their hearts that if they could only get the ointments that the Hellenic Helen and the Nile River Cleopatra enjoyed , they too could cause a man to hide in a horse or could hold high their heads down the gala streets of Rome . Apothecarians of all times have had their guarded cosmetic recipes , each claiming to be the magic formula women desired . Then along came our modern archeologists who uncovered ancient jars of ointment still intact , and when the chemists analyzed their contents , they discovered these glamorous lotions were pretty much the same as our cosmetic manufacturers are turning out by the ton to-day . Every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we 're using the same creams that Helen and Cleo did . " And the advertising agencies clamorously blared that fact to the housetops . No one thought to ask : " Is it not possible that the creams and lotions found in the ruins of Kish and Carthage and Pompeii are outdated ? Is it not possible that in the light of the medical knowledge and research facilities we have to-day we may discover some process of treating the skin that would be really benefi-cial ? It took , of course , centuries for the human race to discover even rudimentary facts about the human anatomy . Hippocrates , living in 40o B.C. , and Galen , living in the second century A.D. , were shining gods among the doctors for hundreds and hundreds of years . None presumed to question their precepts . And Galen had never performed a human dissection . His knowledge of anatomy had been gained chiefly from his studies of the cadavers of sheep and other animals . Then came the adventurous , inquiring minds of the Renaissance , and in the 154o 's the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wrong , that the human anatomy is different from the way Galen had described it . Then dissection after dissection , discovery after discovery . Circulation of the blood . Anwsthetics . Germs . Vaccines . Radiology . Galileo invented the microscope , to be followed by other amazing mechanical aids . Most of this knowledge of the body and the treatment of disease has come in the last hundred years . But in all this time few considered it necessary to make an intensive study of the human skin ? people were too much concerned with what was inside the skin . The dermatologists did learn how to treat outbreaks of the skin with remarkable success , but no one knew much about the anatomy of the skin itself . Then came the great Dr. Una of Hamburg . Through years of research he established the fact that the outermost skin layer ? the layer that is one twenty-fifth of an inch thick ? is made up of minute particles of horn or keratin that are held together by a protein matrix . And that this combination of keratin and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it does n't let any moisture out of the body and no moisture into it . You can swim all day and not soak in any water at all , and the live human body does not dry out under the most arid conditions . He it was who discovered that the only way foreign material can get into the body through the skin is for it to pass down the hair-follicle apparatus at the base of the hairs . And he started making studies of the elasticity of the skin that are still the best contributions to that subject , but he died before he had completed them . BEAUTY IN THE LABORATORY THEN IN 1930 Dr. Lloyd Arnold , in charge of bacteriology and preventive medicine at the University of Illinois , began making other discoveries about the skin . His experiments proved that clean human skin is the best disinfecting agent there is . That you can put thousands of harmful bacteria on clean skin , and the skin will rid itself of them in a few minutes . That clean skin is achieved with soap and water @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ power of the skin . That the palm of the hand disinfects itself more rapidly than any other area . That the membrane lining of the nose and mouth and eyelids has the same disinfecting power as the outside skin , but the line of demarcation between the outside skin and the lining skin is never sterile . These areas hang on to all sorts of bacteria , just as does the space under the finger nails . Also he made the discovery that the keratin layer of the skin is acid in its reaction . In fact it has the most constant acid reaction of any part of the body ? so much so that it immediately makes acid any alkaline that is placed on it . And considering the fact that creams are fats and that most creams have a soap base that is alkaline , it would seem that these findings would have a bearing on the study of complexion . The medical school of the University of Illinois is in Chicago , and I happen to live in Chicago . Dr. Arnold kindly granted an interview . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good complexion . " What is a good complexion ? " he countered . I started to answer and found I could n't . " No one knows , " he said , " and it is n't likely that we can find out how to keep a good complexion until we know scientifically what a good complexion is . " The talk lasted quite a while . Boiled down it amounted to this : the study of healthy skin is a science in itself ; it is a legitimate medical study because the maintenance of well-toned healthy skin , in other words , the " school-girl complexion , " will add much to the happiness of the human race , and anything that adds to the happiness of the human race adds to its mental and physical health . Also it will add years to the economic life of men and women past their youth . The man or woman of sixty who looks young will not be so apt to lose his or her job as the man or woman of sixty whose skin is always drawn and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the study of healthy skin . Both the privately endowed and the state-owned laboratories are maintained with the idea of conquering disease . They have loads of money for the sick , but none for the healthy . They have money for the diseases of the skin . But the study of complexion is the study of healthy skin , or perhaps more accurately , of not unhealthy skin , and for that they have not one cent . If this study of healthy skin could have been accomplished by placing skin tissue under the microscope , it probably would have been done long ere this , because that would have been a comparatively simple and inexpensive research . But the study has to be made on living skin , just as it has been found that the study of endocrine glands got nowhere until scientists began several years ago to study living persons . And the skin study ca n't be made on the skin of just one person , but it will have to be made on thousands of persons over a period of years ? ten or fifteen @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ merely the skin of the face , but it will have to cover every inch of the body to learn how the skin areas differ . Because it is known now that skin around the nostrils and extending wedgeshaped to the chin is of different construction than that of the other areas of the face . The sebaceous glands here are of a very different shape from the fat glands at the base of the hairs of the head . Also it is known that the skin in the armpits and groins differs from the skin in surrounding areas . Dr. Arnold believes , with the rest of the medical profession , that as the research now being done on the endocrine glands of living persons progresses , undoubtedly the cure for a number of complexion troubles will be found . Particularly adolescent acne . This , it is generally known , has a connection with the sex glands . But how far away we are still from knowing the relation between the skin and the glandular structure of the body is shown by the fact that science has n't yet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regional lymph glands . Science presumes with good reason that there are lymph vessels in the skin , but it has not yet been able to demonstrate their presence or to determine the route of communication . Then there is more knowledge needed of the effect of certain vitamins on the health of the skin . Now that people generally are eating more green vegetables , fruits , and milk products , the skin tone of the country has improved enormously . We have clearer complexions today than our grandparents had . But we still need to know more about the vitamins , particularly B and D. Science knows that there is vitamin D in the oily secretion of the skin . Do we wash it away when bathing ? Do we need to replace it ? If so , how can we best replace it ? Then , can we apply a fat to the skin that will not pass into the blood stream but will combine with the natural skin oil ? Lanolin , or sheep fat , comes the closest of the known fats to human fat . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or some other fat be made to stay put ? Dr. Arnold , however , believes that the greatest hope of maintaining the youthfulness of the skin lies in knowing how the keratin layer can be kept from drying out , for senile skin is dehydrated skin . Keratin , while not permitting moisture to go through it ( except through the hair-follicle apparatus ) still has the power of holding and letting go of moisture . It is like a gelatin in that regard ? it thickens and thins according to the amount of moisture it contains . Now , can a process be found that will keep it permanently moist or moist for a long period between treatments ? This problem is complicated in that no one knows the process of keratinization , except that increased friction of the skin develops calluses and corns ( and do n't we know that ! ) . Dr. Una established the fact that keratin is in particles , but are the particles flat or globular or flaky ? Are they laid in a pattern or just hit-and-miss ? Is the pattern the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does it vary , as around the nose ? And do the size of the pores , which are V-shaped and which , since they have no muscles at their base , have no power of expanding or contracting , as beauticians maintain , depend upon the character of the keratin layer in the different in-dividuals ? All these seem like a lot of problems . But medical science has conquered and is conquering other problems that at first seemed just as baffling . Many research doctors would undoubtedly like to work on skin . Who will give the research laboratories of the country the money to carry on these experiments that would benefit everyone beyond the age of thirty ? The food industries have furnished the research money for the study of vitamins . It would seem logical then that the two-billiondollar cosmetic industry would feel that it should bring its products out of the tomb of King Tut and into the light of the twentieth century . But the president of a large toiletsoap concern , when asked whether he would contribute to a research fund , said : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may not be known for ten or fifteen or twenty years . And part of the money for it would have to come out of 1933 dividends . My job is to make the dividends for 1933 as big as I can . " So the question is : How much longer will the women of this country keep on paying out billions of dollars for something they do n't get ?
