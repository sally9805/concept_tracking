Last week President Nicholas Murray Butler of Columbia University told Barnard College alumnae that in all the land there are only " about eight universities . . . and about eight more which have a university aspect and a university standard for a part of their activities . " A true university , said he , is not a group of professional schools , but a " power house of the mind . " Asked to name his Eight , he chuckled : " Oh , no ! no ! No , thank you !
