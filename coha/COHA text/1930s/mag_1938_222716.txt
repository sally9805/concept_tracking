The stately white &; gold ballroom of Buckingham Palace , accustomed to the stricter rhythms of military bands , last week reverberated to one of Britain 's best bands , Bert Ambrose 's Prince 's Restaurant Orchestra . King George &; Queen Elizabeth were entertaining some 1,000 " personal friends " at the Royal Derby Night Ball . Among the guests were Queen Mary , the Queen Mother , the Duke &; Duchess of Kent , the Duke &; Duchess of Gloucester , U. S. Ambassador Joseph P. &; Mrs. Kennedy , Colonel &; Mrs. Charles A. Lindbergh . The King and othermale guests wore the court dress of tailcoat and knee breeches . Lone holdout was Ambassador Kennedy , who stuck to his long trousers . <P> For the first time in palace history an American girl was allowed to " swing it " with the musicians . The swingstress was 20-year-old Evelyn Dall , a lissome ash-blonde from New York 's Bronx . A onetime hoofer in Billy Rose 's Manhattan Music Hall . Miss Dall went abroad in 1933 , was leading lady with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London swing band . London cafe-goers know her as ' ' Ambrose 's Bronx Bombshell . " Miss Dall , whose real name is Evelyn Mildred Fuss , took her stage name from that of President Roosevelt 's grandchildren . <P> Last week , attired in a slithering backless blue satin evening gown , she sent the royal hosts and guests swinging with hot choruses of the latest U. S. numbers . Said the ' ' Bronx Bombshell " after her performance : " I was busy as a bee the whole evening looking at all the famous faces . This is an evening that I will remember all my life . ' ' <P> Said her father , a Manhattan postal clerk : " Evelyn 's a good kid . She swings and sways like nobody 's business . I hope she pleased the King and Queen . "
