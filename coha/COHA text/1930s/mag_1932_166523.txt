Socialists this year followed the novel party procedure of first nominating their presidential candidate , then building a platform under him . Fortnight ago , at the Socialist National Convention in Milwaukee , the 1932 Socialist ticket was named-for President , Norman Thomas of New York ; for Vice President , James H. Maurer , onetime president of the Pennsylvania Federation of Labor-same ticket which received 267,420 votes in 1928 . A 60-minute ovation greeted these uncontested nominations . Nominee Thomas ' keynote : " The choice now confronting the world is between Socialism and catastrophe ! " <P> Last week the Socialists , with considerably less harmony , began formulating the issues on which Nominees Thomas &; Maurer will campaign . A bitter struggle resulted in what Colyumist Heywood Broun , defeated Socialist candidate for Congress and New York City alderman , wryly called his " first political victory . " The convention voted ( 80-to-71 ) for repeal of the 18th Amendment and Government sale of liquor . Other plans : U. S. recognition of Soviet Russia , participation in the League of Nations , ten @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , cancellation of War debts , increased inheritance , personal and corporation income taxes , a two-year moratorium on foreclosures and tax sales of homes and farms .
