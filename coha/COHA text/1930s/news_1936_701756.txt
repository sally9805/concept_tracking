Mr. Blanshard made known the results of an investigation conducted by his office at the request of Victor F. Ridder , Works Progress Administrator , and the Enaer-1 gency Relief Bureau . The investigation is continuing with the assistance of six persons in the office of the Commissioner of Accounts and four members of the staff of the ERB and WPA . Most of those who have obtained the WPA jobs by purchasing the forged referral cards or slips are laborers , earning on the average Wi a month . Not being on home relief , they were not entitled to the jobs . Prosecutor to Get Data . Mr. Blanshard made his disclosure in Mr. Ridder 's office in the Port Authority Building , in the presence of other WPA officials . Mr. Ridder said that wherever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over to the United States Attorney . " Our investigation thus far has disclosed two rings of fixers and forgers who had either stolen or forged referral cards which gave WPA jobs to persons who were not on the relief rolls , and therefore not entitled to these jobs , " Mr. Blanshard said . " The cards and slips were sold for sums ranging from $5 to $30 . " The leader of the Brooklyn ring was Anthony Bongiorno of 379 Menahan Street , Brooklyn , who operated from a cigar store at 168 Central Avenue , Brooklyn . Bongiorno has been missing since this investigation has been started , and a search for him has been in progress by the WPA Bureau of Investigation and the New York City police . Probably 500 victims paid money to Bongiorno or his assistants , and most of them secured work with these forged referral cards . " Our evidence concerning the Brooklyn ring has been referred to the United States District Attorney . Our investigation of the Manhattan ring is still continuing . " Mr. Blanshard added that " every effort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the fixers and any political leaders " and that the results of this part of the investigation would be made known later . Doubts Political Connections . Mr. Ridder expressed the opinion that the job-selling was a racket and had no political connections . Mr. Blanshard would not dwell upon any possible political aspect , saying that thus far no evidence in that direction had been unearthed . The commissioner based his estimate of the number of jobs sold upon the examination by his office of some 250 witnesses , consisting of persons who bought the jobs , all of whom , he said , appeared to be needy . He challenged the assertion made earlier in the day by Herbert Benjamin , secretary-treasurer of the National Unemployment Council , a left-wing Communist organization , that as many as 40,000 persons have found jobs fraudulently with the WPA in this city , Mr. Benjamin 's charge was made in a letter to Harry L. Hopkins , Federal WPA Administrator , demanding an investigation . The letter declared that about $1,000,000 of public funds was being diverted weekly from WPA funds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ WPA rolls with the assistance of Tammany Hall politicians . He referred to the investigation started by Mr. Blanshard , saying " it was apparently halted by Mr. Blanshard as soon as the seriousness of the findings was realized . " Mr. Blanshard characterized the figure of 40,000 as a gross exaggeration and declared that Mr. Ben- jamin 's statement regarding the halting of the investigation was " outrageous poppycock . " Mr. Blanshard said he had requested Mr. Benjamin to appear this morning at his office , 2 Lafayette Street , to explain this charge as well as statements that Mr. Blanshard had induced Police Commissioner Valentine " to release certain persons who had been apprehended as suspected counterfeiters of WPA referral slips . " He also wants to clear up the charge that the fraudulent employment of 40,000 persons had been known to Mr. Ridder , Miss Charlotte Carr , executive director of the ERB , Mr. Blanshard and the Police Commissioner , with the Implication that they have failed to act upon them . Bee Communist Propaganda . WPA officials characterized the charges as " another illustration of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ administration for political purposes . " Daniel S. Ring , assistant WPA administrator in charge of personnel , pointed out that this number constituted only one-half of 1 per cent of the employes of the WPA and that their total wages did not exceed $15,000 a week , Mr. Ridder indicated that only in flagrant cases would prosecution be urged against the workers who bought the jobs , since most of them were actually needy , but said strong action would be taken against the racketeers . Mr. Blanshard said that the original forgeries were uncovered by the WPA and turned over to the ERB , which , in turn , transmitted the evidence to him for investigation . He said that during the investigation three persons were arrested but released the following day when " they displayed willingness to talk freely and assist in the investigation . " The investigation also disclosed , he said , that most of those who bought the jobs had to borrow money to pay the heads of the alleged rings . Mr. Ring explained that a new card system in effect since Feb. 1 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The WPA , he said , now has absolute control over the cards and close cooperation with the Home Relief Bureau will facilitate the detection of frauds.
