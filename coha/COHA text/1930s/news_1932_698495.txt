txt ART FORUM Readers Debate the " Native Art " Issue To the Art Editor : COMMERCIALISM , especially in the United States , has become so powerful and so aggressive that it tends to uproot every existing human value . Yet there is no artist under the sun who can create art of quality without faith in human values . The American artist should realize that his real enemy is not foreign art , but the unbridled power of commercialism . The problems of the artist will not be solved by retreating and seeking solace in nationalism . Nationalism is a narrow and barren piece of land  --  an unsuitable home for creative artists . The American artist should sharpen his weapon , not against foreign art but against the business point of view in the arts . Only after he has freed himself from the shackles of the destructive influence of commercialism will the American artist be able to put lasting values into his work .
