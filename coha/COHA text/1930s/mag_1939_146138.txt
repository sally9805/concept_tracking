When spade &; shovel were deep in the dumps of Flushing Meadows , there were still no plans for exhibiting U. S. art at the New York World 's Fair . Alarmed artists ' associations all over the country started pounding at Grover Whalen . Eventually Mr. Whalen announced that , under the chairmanship of A. Conger Goodyear , president of Manhattan 's Museum of Modern Art , the Fair would put on a big contemporary U. S. art show . <P> Opening punctually , as many an earlier planned exhibit did not , American Art Today turned out to be the biggest show of its kind ever put on . From some 25,000 entries , judges chose 1,214 examples of painting , sculpture and the graphic arts .

Ranging from tame portraits of young girls to woozy , crawling abstractions , from genteel sculptures in baby-blue plaster to great blocks of stone , from Christmas-cardy woodcuts to elusive black-and-whites , the show represents all trends , tastes , techniques . A few exhibits , with their wavering lines , nave perspectives , jumbled colors , may invite perplexed comparison with little Hilda 's fourth-grade drawings . But there is not enough surrealism to bite beholders . Many things in the exhibition treat in some way of the American scene . <P> The show gives evidence of enormous energy among U. S. artists . Less evident is their collective importance . Seldom old-fogy , often bold , they are oftener members of a school , children of an era , than unmistakable individuals . Attesting the show 's variety are such pictures as Benton 's quiet , lonesome Conversation ; Doris Lee 's whimsical , clever Holiday ( see cut ) ; Joe Hirsch 's Two Men ( see cut ) which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ breadthwise the gaunt intensity of two workers ; Jack Levine 's Rouault-like Night Scene , where the ruddy heads and hands of the two figures emerge from a blue-black murk like blazing coals.
