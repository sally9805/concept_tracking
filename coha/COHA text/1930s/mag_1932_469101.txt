IT IS a spring morning in the year 1903 . Mr. Wigmore is about to depart on a five-hundred-mile motor tour . His wife , fluttery and on the verge of tears , clings to him . " Promise me you 'll be careful , Tom , " she pleads . " Do promise me you 'll be careful . I sha n't be able to sleep a wink . " Mr. Wigmore silences her with a. solid , husbandly kiss . " Of course I 'll be careful , " he says . " Anyone 'd think I was going to Borneo . There 's not the slightest danger . " He puts on his motoring cap , blue serge with a patent leather visor , tightens the straps at the wrists of his ankle-length linen duster , and strides to his car . Though impatient to be off , he moves deliberately . It is only six o'clock , but neighbors are watching him from behind curtained windows , charitably hoping something will go wrong . Mr. Wigmore is still so new to the sport of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ incident to starting the motor . First the spark must be retarded and the throttle opened a few notches . The levers are beneath the steering wheel , on the right-hand side of the brass column . But which is which ? It is important not to confuse them , He has already done that once and narrowly escaped having his arm broken by the crank handle when the motor kicked . He pictures himself in the act of driving , recalls definitely that the throttle is the lower of the two levers , and setsboth in the starting position . Next he throws the ignition switch , a black-knobbed strip of copper at the front of the wooden coil box on the dashboard . After that it is necessary to turn on the fuel valve and tickle the carburetor . As the gas tank is under the front seat and the single-cylinder engine is slung horizontally amidships , Mr. Wigmore has to squat down and attend to these matters by the touch system . Presently the scent of raw gasoline dripping into the dust tells him the motor is ready @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engages the business end of the twenty-four-inch crank handle with the dogs on the engine flywheel . Then he stands up , takes a deep breath , and gives the handle a mighty heave ... three mighty heaves . " Touff , " coughs the motor , " Touff , touff , touff . " Flinging the crank handle into the tonneau , Mr. Wigmore scrambles into the driver 's seat . Obeying the dictum of the instruction book to do nothing suddenly , notch by notch he advances the spark and notch by notch closes the throttle . In a few moments the motor warms to its work and settles down to steady firing . Mr. Wigmore can now afford to relax a trifle ? outwardly . He is n't under way yet and knows that if he is n't careful with the low-speed clutch he may stall the engine , which will mean cranking all over again . But as he adjusts his goggles and pulls on his gauntlets he assumes an air of nonchalance . " So long , m'dear , " he says . " Phone Harry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And do n't worry . " Tripping the latch of the brake pedal , he steps on the low-speed pedal and chugs down the driveway to the street . After a little , when the ear has gathered momentum , he releases the low-speed and pushes forward the high-speed lever , which projects from the body , convenient to his right hand . His friend Harry Osgood , who is to accompany him on the tour , lives only a few blocks away , much less than a normal ten minutes ' drive , but the local speed limit of eight miles an hour is strictly enforced . Driving for any distance at so slow a pace in a one-cylinder car is tricky business , for if you remain in low gear your motor will overheat ; whereas high gear will carry you too fast , or stall your engine . Using a method of his own , which sends his machine along in a series of erratic spurts , Mr. Wigmore manages at length to reach his friend 's house . Having driven alone only four times previously , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ journey without mishap . He is going on the club tour largely to gain experience , so that on his return he will be able to call himself a full-fledged motorist , with five hundred miles under his belt . Meanwhile ? to repeat ? he is glad to have reached Mr. Osgood 's without having hit anything ; and to signalize his safe arrival he blows several sharp toots with his horn , which has a large rubber bulb and sounds alternately like a child in pain and a goat with bronchitis . Dogs bark . Citizens in adjacent houses thrust their heads out of bedroom windows and condemn him and his horn and his auto and everything that is his . Appearing not to hear them , Mr. Wigmore walks leisurely around the ear , stooping to examine the tires , which so far still have good smooth treads , undefaced by cuts or blisters . At length , valise in hand , Mr. Osgood steps down the path . He , too , is enveloped from throat to ankles in a duster , though his is of gray @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his friend , opens the door in the rear of the tonneau , and appraises its contents with a practiced eye . Mr. Osgood is a post-graduate , who has already driven over a thousand miles . The only reason he is accompanying Mr. Wigmore , instead of piloting his own car , is that the latter still shows the effects of having been wrapped round a tree . " Well , Tom , " he says , " you seem to have thought of just about everything ? but suppose I just get a few odds and ends that might come in handy . " He goes to his barn and returns laden with tarpaulin , shovel , axe , oil lantern , and a coil of half-inch rope . " I have a tow line , " observes Mr. Wigmore . " Of course , " says the other . " But this rope is for times when we may perhaps be stuck with no one to tow us . Often by tying one end to a post or tree and winding a turn around the wheel hub , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pull itself out of a hole . That , " he adds , " is one of the things you have to learn through experience . " " Ah , " says Mr. Wigmore , mollified . " Well , better get going , eh ? " He adjusts the spark and throttle levers , throws the switch , and fishes out the crank handle from the tonneau . As a starting place for the tour , the club has chosen the vacant circus lot on the outskirts of town . When our two entrants reach this rendez-vous , upwards of a dozen machines are already on the field , drawn up side by side in a line , with half the town loafers and small boys clustered about them . An official with a white armband signals Mr. Wigmore to park alongside the nearest car , and he tries to do so . But his judgment of speed and distance is unreliable , so that it is only through the vigilance of Mr. Osgood , who seizes the wheel , that the car is prevented from ramming the end one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ensue , for Mr. Wigmore , rattled by the crowd , forgets how to stop . However , his friend cuts off the ignition and , in the interests of general safety , suggests that they push the car into place . This done , the two are free to examine some of the other machines . Next to his own Cadillac stands a Locomobile steamer , of the Stanhope model , for four passengers . It has tiller steering , and but for that and the absence of shafts , and the box at the rear covering the machinery , it looks exactly like an ordinary carriage with a fringed canopy top . These Loco-mobiles are generally considered to be practical and efficient machines and , like the Whites and the Stanleys , have attained no little popularity , especially in hilly regions , for they climb like cats . Next in line is an Autocar , a compact and sturdily built product of Pennsylvania , in appearance somewhat similar to his own machine . It has a tonneau with rear entrance and with rectangular wicker hampers slung along the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Like the Cadillac , it has a small bonnet in front of the dash , for the sake of appearance and as a cover for the water tank ; and the engine , of the two-cylinder opposed type , is placed horizontally below the body . The steering eolumn is vertical and surmounted , instead of by a wheel , by a short handle-bar , with grips . The gear levers protrude through slots in the front seat , a very neat arrangement . Then comes an Oldsmobile , one of the best known and most popular of American runabouts , a graceful little car with tiller steering and a curved dash . With its spidery wire wheels , it seems fragile compared with its neighbor to the right , a four-passenger Winton , which has a folding seat for two in front of the driver 's . But all the machines of domestic make look crude and frail in comparison with the foreign cars , of which there are three : a Panhard , a Mercedes , and a Fiat . These belong to wealthy members of the Automobile Club @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have come down from New York to show the boys how a proper tour should be conducted . Naturally , the imported cars are centers of interest , for Europe , particularly France , is far ahead of the United States in automobile engineering and design . All three of these cars have vertical four-cylinder motors , mounted in front , protected from rain and dirt by metal bonnets above and splash aprons underneath . They differ from the domestic machines in other respects , too , having sliding-gear transmissions , instead of planetary , dual driving chains instead of single , magneto as well as battery ignition , mechanical engine lubricators , hand pumps to feed fuel under pressure on hills ? in short , a host of improvements and innovations which will appear on American models later in the year . From headlights to tail-lights they glisten with brass and copper . Their steering columns , levers , clocks and speedometers , dash oilers and switches are made of one or the other of these metals , while their luxurious side-entrance bodies , richly painted and varnished , are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such a car cost ? " inquires Mr. Wigmore , indicating the Panhard . " All told , " says his friend , " including duty and lamps and magneto and everything , between six and seven thousand dollars . Thinking of ordering one ? " " I 'm not quite that crazy , " replies Mr. Wigmore . learn to drive my thousand-dollar one first . " " You fellers are all crazy , " mutters an elderly bystander . " You and your new-fangled stinkpots ! Scaring horses and decent folks out of their wits . If I had my way I 'd clap the lot of you in jail . " " That Mercedes is a handsome car too , " says Mr. Wigmore . " Was n't it in a Mercedes that Willie K. Vanderbilt Jr . did the mile in thirty-nine flat at Ormond this spring ? " " Yes . Beat Henry Ford 's record by two-fifths of a second . Nearly eighty miles an hour , Tom . Think of it . " " Believe I 'll get me a real fast car some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ o'clock the chairman of the tour committee gives the order to get ready . Officials bustle about , elbowing the knots of loafers , shouting instructions . For the hundredth time , drivers peer into fuel , water , and oil tanks , measure their contents with sticks , and scrutinize their tires . Steam-car owners turn up their main burners , pump air and watch their pressure gauges , while the gasoline contingent tighten ignition terminals and inspect coil vibrators . Though the actual start is half an hour away , many drivers , Mr. Wigmore included , crank up their motors , in order not to be left behind because of last-minute balkiness . At last the chairman takes his place beside the driver of the Panhard and waves his hand . The great car , its muffler cut-out open , roars across the lot and takes to the road . One by one the others follow , some belching clouds of steam , others streamers of blue smoke . Shivering with nervousness , Mr. Wigmore awaits his turn . Whenit comes , he presses on the low-speed pedal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , but the motor dies . " The brake , " shouts Osgood . " You forgot the brake . " The little man dives into the tonneau for the crank handle . " Now then . Spark retarded ? No . Not that way ; the other way . All right . " He cranks the engine and hops into his seat . This time , to the accompaniment of jeers and catcalls from the onlookers , the car begins to roll . It has lost its original place in the line but , thanks to Osgood 's quick action , only two others have nosed in ahead . On the move at last , with the cool air blowing in his face , Mr. Wigmore recovers his composure . The road is dusty , but level and fairly smooth . The car bowls along like a live thing . " This , " says Mr. Wigmore , " is the life . " " If it does n't rain , " amends the other , squinting at the western sky , where fleecy clouds are banking . Mr. Osgood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when it did rain . He knows there are hills ahead and stretches of sand and clay . He remembers having skidded into one sinkhole from which it took five cars and twenty men two hours to extricate him . Part of the game , of course , but not exactly fun . For two hours the run is uneventful . The pace-making Panhard sets a steady speed of sixteen miles an hour . At twelve-thirty the leaders turn off the road into a field , followed by the rest of the procession . They have reached the midday control , where they will eat lunch and replenish supplies of fuel , oil , and water from stores sent up in advance by the club . The period of steady driving has given Mr. Wig-more confidence , so that when his turn comes to park he accomplishes the feat with admirable sangfroid . Everyone is in high spirits and loudly enthusiastic over the sport . Hampers are opened and their contents devoured . And there are bottles of beer , too , warm and foamy , but thirst-quenching . Soon , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have tanks to fill , nuts to tighten , joints and bearings to oil , leaky tires to pump up . Mr. Wigmore has barely crawled out from beneath his car , oil can in hand , a smudge of greenish-black grease between his eyebrows , when the order is given to start again . But now comes his first real setback . Harry Osgood , poking about in the tonneau in search of the crank handle , can not find it . Suddenly he has a flash of horrid memory . " Jumping Judas , " he cries , turning gray . " We have n't got it . " " We what ? " " We left it behind . I left it behind . Back at the starting field . After you stalled the motor . I jumped down and turned her over and climbed in again quick . I turned her over and dropped the handle . Never gave it a thought . On my ear you do n't have to . The handle just hangs there . Oh , my Lord ? " Fortunately the driver @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Lost your crank handle , eh ? " he says . " Do n't let that worry you . Put your high gear in , hitch on to my car , and tow you till she starts . But do n't feed her too much gas , or she 'll be climbing lip my back . " And after starting Mr. Wigmore 's motor in this extraordinary fashion , the good Samaritan gives him another useful hint . " In ease you get stalled on the road , " he says , " and there 's nobody else around to tow you , just jack up one of your rear wheels , put your high gear in , and crank her by turning the jacked-up wheel . " It would be pleasant to be able to describe Mr. Wigmore 's homecoming as a triumph . The truth is , however , that going down a steep hill he loses control and lands in a ditch ; he is obliged to ship his machine home by rail . The year of Mr. Wigmore 's debut , 1903 , was important in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established long-distance touring as one of the most attractive forms of automobiling . Extensive club tours , tours of individuals over all sections of the country , tours to the arctic circle and the crossing of the continent by three automobile parties and by a motor bicyclist demonstrated the fitness of American cars for rough , hard work . " It was in that year too that the making of motor cars really took root as an industry , Detroit alone turning out some eight thousand machines , a production figure which placed her well ahead of her many rivals throughout the Middle West and the East . At this time , and for several years thereafter , every man who bought a car hastened to join his local automobile club ; or , if none existed , helped to form one . Membership in an organization was not only desirable as affording pleasant contacts with kindred spirits , but was a practical necessity . It is difficult to-day to realize how bitterly the advent of the automobile was opposed by the majority in all classes of society . Even among @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ early purchasers , there were those whose antipathy to the horseless carriage amounted to fanaticism . Mr. George Haven , for instance , who not only closed his Lenox estate to motors , but tried to induce all the clubs at that fashionable resort to bar them from their grounds . It was among the people in general , however , and farmers in particular , that motorists met with the most violent opposition . And since in those days politicians were even more subservient to the rural vote than they are now , it was not long before the prevailing sentiment was reflected in the attitude of office holders , from legislators down to country constables . With the people and their representatives aligned solidly against him , the motorist was forced to organize in self-defense . " We must all hang together , " ran the slogan of the Massachusetts Automobile Club , " or we shall all hang separately . " Thus when a driver was haled to court , for exceeding the speed limit or frightening a horse , he could turn to his club for bail @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ membership he obtained other benefits also , such as reduced rates from accredited garages for supplies , towing and repairs , special consideration at official hotels , and information as to routes and road conditions . Mapping and marking highways with adequate signposts were among the most useful activities of the early clubs , the largest of which for years maintained field crews engaged in such work . In fact until the clubs ? followed by commercial ventures such as the Blue Books ? began gathering it , highway information simply did not exist . Unless he knew someone who had already made the trip , the New York motorist , say , wishing to visit his brother in Ohio , had no way of telling in advance how long the journey might take , how much it might cost , what conditions he might expect to encounter en route , or whether to go by way of Buffalo or Pittsburgh . His only course was to make a start in the general direction of his objective and make inquiries every few miles , trusting to luck to find here and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the ability to communicate it . For every native who would give him information in a spirit of helpfulness , he could count on half a dozen otherswho would deliberately misdirect him just out of spite . This is one explanation of the popularity of club tours , the routes of which were surveyed in advance . For this purpose a Pathfinder was sent out some time before the starting date , to blaze the trail . As a ride two men were assigned to the pathfinding car . It was their job to drive over roads that few , if any , automobiles had ever before traversed , mapping and photographing them and taking notes on their condition . Upon the intimate knowledge of the terrain thus gained , the club officials would chart the itinerary , fixing the length of each day 's rim according to the nature and topography of the lanes and turnpikes , the facilities for garaging the cars and housing and feeding their occupants . The success of club tours in 1903 led to the promotion of many of these events the following year . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louis , scene of the Louisiana Purchase Exposition . This tour proved so enjoyable to one participant that at its conclusion he announced that he would donate a permanent trophy , to be competed for annually in long-distance touring contests . He was a Boston sportsman who had broken into the news the year before by crossing the Arctic Circle in his ear and his name was Charles J. Glidden . For several years the tours he inaugurated shared with the Vanderbilt Cup races the center of the American motoring stage . While racing as a means of arousing interest and testing cars had many advocates , Mr. Glidden believed that emphasizing speed merely supplied the enemies of motoring with ammunition and led to a tightening of restrictions already far too stringent . To save the motor from being legislated out of existence ? as had been the fate of steam road coaches in England many years before ? it was necessary to stress its qualities of endurance and utility . Consequently Mr. Glidden stipulated that foremost among the conditions governing his projected tours should be the requirement that entrants must @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be penalties for arriving at a given point late , but also for arriving ahead of time . The victory would go to that driver whose car had earned a perfect score by covering the route without being penalized for lateness , or earliness , or for any other violations of the rules . Already most of the motor clubs of the country were members of the American Automobile Association , a central body controlling virtually all contests . It was , therefore , under the auspices of this national organization that the Glidden Tours were to be run . In his deed of gift their originator laid down the broad principles of his plan , appointing a committee to work out the details . The contests were to be open to members of any American club affiliated with the A. A. A .. or any club in the world recognized by it . The individual club would have custody of the trophy . The distance of each year 's tour should be not less than a thousand miles , of which not less than five hundred were to be covered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the regular roads of the country in which the trophy was held . Only fully equipped touring cars might be entered . The owner of each was to be a passenger , whether or not he actually drove . In the event that he did not drive , the driver of his choice must meet with the approval of the committee . The circuit of the first Glidden Tour ran from New York , via Springfield , Boston , and Portsmouth , to Bretton Woods in the White Mountains ; thence to Concord , N. H. , Worcester , Pittsfield , Poughkeepsie , and back to the starting point . It was well chosen , the makers could not weather the postwar depression . The steamer died and I , for one , still mourn it , for it was a delight to drive . And though I be called a wild ass braying in the wilderness , I still maintain that steam cars could be built , minus the defects of their predecessors , that would eclipse gasoline cars in performance , ease of handling , and cost of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ would have the cardinal virtue of silent , flowing power , applied and controlled through the simple mediums of a throttle and a brake . I do not suppose another steam car will ever be placed upon the market ( fifty million engineers ca n't be wrong ) , and if one is it will certainly not be because of any word of mine ; yet I shall continue to hope some day to see headlines reading : New Season 's Models Driven by Steam ? Industry Goes Back to Simple Principles , Says Expert . You never can tell . It might happen . Experiments are now being carried on with two-cycle motors again -- motors such as were used long ago in the Elmore . And Sir Dennistoun Burney 's recently introduced " tear drop " design , the most advanced example of streamlining yet produced , relegates the motor to its oldtime position at the rear of the chassis . This detour has taken me far afield , so by way of getting back onto the main road , I shall add that for several years , on account of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pathfinders for the Glidden Tours . To be chosen for this exacting service was almost as high an honor as being declared winner of the contest . For that matter , there was honor for the motorist in merely completing the trip , as driver or passenger . " The Trophyists making this tour , " said Motor , " will have accomplished somewhat over a thousand miles , which will admit them to that ? to motoristssacred fraternity of long-distance tourists and give them an enviable reputation as such . " On the first Glidden tour drivers were privileged to start each morning between six and ten o'clock , but neither before nor after those hours , except with the penalty of a discredit mark . To retain a perfect score , each car was required to register before nine o'clock at the night stop . Not only on this , but on subsequent tours , the cars were closely guarded overnight , for the dual purpose of preventing drivers from making adjustments or repairs , which were allowed during running time only , and to prevent inquisitive outsiders from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the tourists felt justified in sleeping late , for one could never be sure , no matter how steadily a motor had been running the day before , that it would start without a struggle in the morning . There was always a scramble to be among the first checked out ; and it was a common sight to see drivers come to an abrupt stop , a few moments after being officially cleared , and crawl under their machines . Whether repairs or adjustments were necessary or not , it was desirable to be as near the head of the procession as possible , for the leaders met better road conditions and had to swallow less dust than those bringing up the rear . Most fortunate of all , from the standpoint of priority , were the official confetti layers , who started every morning about half an hour before the tour proper , to mark the route at intersections and forks . On some occasions their work was nullified by the winds , or by natives who thought it a good joke to sweep up the confetti and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On one tour , having exhausted their supply of colored paper , the confetti crew substituted white beans , to the edification of the roadside poultry , which ate these trail marks before the tourists came along . Many and varied were the Gliddenites ' experiences . In Leicester , Massachusetts , eight contestants were fined fifteen dollars apiece for violating speed laws on the way through . On the return trip , as a protest against this inhospitable treatment , the whole caravan hired a band and proceeded through the Leicester streets at snail 's pace , to the accompaniment of a dirge . That was during the 1905 tour , which ran smoothly , all things considered , and was voted a great success . The following year the route was harder ? to Bretton Woods again , but from Buffalo via Montreal , Quebec , Jackman , and Rangeley , Maine ? and the A. A. A. committee in charge came in for a good deal of criticism for their handling of the arrangements . At Three Rivers , for instance , having found the local hotel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of whom were women , the committee had chartered a river steamboat for sleeping quarters . But they had overlooked the fact that the boat had no catering facilities , and that the little hotel could serve only a few meals at a time , so that the hungry horde , driven to forage for themselves , dined for the most part on crackeri and cheese . At one stop in Maine many malcontents revolted upon learning that the committee expected them to pay five dollars a head for the privilege of sleeping in tents , plus an additional sum for the garaging of their machines , also in tents . Since their cars had stood in the open all night at Three Rivers , they saw no reason why they should pay for sheltering them under canvas here . They did not use the word " racket " but they voiced the suspicion that the committee and thetent firm were in cahoots ? and went off to find bed and board in neighboring farmhouses . For a considerable part of the distance the tourists had encountered terrible roads , some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sand , others on which the dust clouds became " so dense that a searchlight was necessary , " still others so rocky that cars bent axles and broke springs . But despite these conditions and despite dissension , the tour was far from a failure . Out of forty-three contesting cars , thirteen finished with perfect scores , a remarkable record considering that to earn them they were required to check in on time at controls located twenty-five miles apart all along the route . The spirit of drivers who kept on for the fun of it , even though hopelessly penalized , was really amazing . So was their ingenuity . In fact it almost seems as though they should have been rewarded , rather than punished , for making repairs . On an execrable detour chosen by the confetti layers because of washed-out bridges on the main road , one car sustained a broken steering spindle and bent axle . The driver made a new spindle at a blacksmith shop , straightened the bent parts , and set forth again in six hours . Another , whose gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hole and went on again in twenty-three minutes . In the 1907 Glidden , as the result of a broken steering-arm ball joint , one car spilled its occupants into the Ohio State Canal . No one was hurt , and after the driver and his companions had had the car fished out and drained of surplus water , they rigged ropes from the tie-rod to the emergency-brake lever and steered with that . Another case was that of a driver whose motor sustained a broken connecting rod . Instead of withdrawing , he took down the engine , removed the piston from the affected cylinder , and finished the trip running on the other three . The commonplaceness of such proofs of engineering genius and rugged determination makes one wonder whether the early motorist was of tougher fiber than we are to-day . I do not think he was . What he did we too could and would do ? if we had to , as he did . But we do n't have to , thank God . The rules imposed heavy penalties for buying en route parts or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the puzzling question as to what spare parts to take along and where to carry them . Inexperienced or pessimistic drivers went so far as to include spare pistons , cylinders , springs , and even entire axle assemblies in their dunnage . And as the rules required also that each car carry its full complement of passengers , machines were sometimes so overloaded that they could not run uphill unless the passengers got out and walked . Seasoned drivers were usually somewhat fatalistic . Knowing the impossibility of foretelling what might break , they took few parts , or none at all , relying on a plentiful supply of bicycle tape and stout cord with which to bind up such injuries as their cars might sustain . A cracked frame could almost always be made to last through a tour by lashing wooden splints on it ? as a surgeon bandages a fracture ? and so could broken springs and wheel spokes . If wire were needed the resourceful tourist could cut a length of it from a farmer 's fence . Many men of neat habit took delight @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bodies , so that when touring they would not need to drape the car with odds and ends of hardware which looked unsightly and scratched the paint . Emergency tanks for fuel , oil , and water ? very necessary in those days ? they cleverly concealed behind choice examples of cabinet work . " Last , but by no means least , " said Motor , " is the bottle or two of real rye so necessary in chilly or very wet weather , for chills and the like , and one bright man has brought out recently a small buffet to be carried on the run-board , easily accessible in event of illness and amply large for all pressing needs . " The third Glidden tour , from Canton to Pittsburgh , via Chicago , was in many ways more strenuous than the first two . Its participants encountered not only dust and mud , but had trouble with the natives to boot . The run of one hundred and sixty-six miles between Toledo and South Bend was a hard grind through hub-deep slimy clay . Cars were constantly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ four times in as many days . Near Waterloo the inhabitants , hoping to reap a golden harvest , had piled dirt on the road and wet it down ; but the tourists managed to avoid this artificial morass without recourse to the waiting horses . At Hammond , a native tried to wreck the party by laying a telegraph pole across the highway . Near the Ohio-Pennsylvania border , one of the ears was fired on and hit , but its occupants went unscathed . Tire trouble , of course , was a major cause of delays . One of the most heartbreaking cases was that of a driver who had completed two-thirds of a tour with a perfect score , only to have a series of six punctures within twenty-five miles . In 1908 the Glidden rules were amended to permit tourists to make tire repairs without incurring penalties , provided they kept their motors running . This was a sensible change , for tire failure was as likely to delay the best of cars as the worst . Even after the adoption of demountable rims , introduced in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , together with patches , cement , French chalk , sandpaper , and an assortment of tire irons . Blow-out patches , for internal or external application to casings , were in every man 's kit . It was common to sec cars with prominent bulges on all four tires . On one tour an unfortunate driver who started with three new spares was forced to cut one into sections to make blow-out patches for the rest . Tire development lagged far behind that of motors and running gear . Even as late as 1914 casings were guaranteed for only four thousand miles . The Glidden regulations were progressively altered and complicated , until by 1910 the competitions had become different from their originator 's conception of them . In that year the tour was open only to certified stock cars . At his own expense , each entrant was required to furnish an observer , who rode in a different car each day , as directed by the referee , and whose duty it was to record all repairs and adjustments made . Before the start , all working parts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Extra parts and tools , also sealed and stamped , were placed in the custody of the observer and , therefore , could not be used without his knowledge . At the end of the run the cars were examined again and scores were computed on an elaborate system of penalties and allowances . Like the preceding one , the 1910 tour was a makers ' rather than an owners ' event and in consequence owners lost interest . The following year attempts to promote a Reciprocity Tour , from Washington to Ottawa , failed for lack of entries , and it seemed for a time as though the Glidden would never be run again . In the autumn of 1911 , however , a modest run from New York to Jacksonville was organized under the old simple rules , without observers and with penalties only for lateness at controls . This tour was a success and temporarily revivified the famous classic . The official Pathfinder made the trip of 1,490 miles in ten days ' running time . Nowadays one can drive from New York to Palm Beach , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , without traveling dangerously fast or driving after dark . But on one 18-mile stretch of the route in 1910 there were toll gates every five miles ; and of the stretch between Lake City and Jacksonville the Pathfinder reported that it was " a lonely , puzzling drive , a mere trail through the pine woods and cypress swamps . " Despite the success of this tour , however , the end of the Glidden contests was not far off . They no longer held the center of the stage . The Munsey Tours and scores of other similar events had stolen some of their thunder . Not only that , but motorists were losing their taste for traveling en masse . It was no longer necessary . Roads were being mapped and marked , oiled and tarred as fast as the money could be appropriated . Chambers of Commerce and hotel associations were actively promoting family touring .

It is true that they did display courage and determination and that their fame and fortunes were dearly earned .

It would be merely an act of decent gratitude , it seems to me , if the motor industry were to erect in Detroit suitable @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not be expensive or elaborate .
