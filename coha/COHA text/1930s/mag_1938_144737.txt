In March 1933 , when Moody 's spot commodity price index stood at 88 , Franklin Roosevelt announced that commodity prices should go up . By March 1937 , they had reached 220 on Moody 's Index . Then Franklin Roosevelt announced that commodity prices were too high , thereby touched off a world-wide break in prices which many economists now consider the beginning of Depression II . Last February , when Moody 's Index stood at 150 , Franklin Roosevelt again sounded off on commodity prices , declared that with certain exceptions such as building materials they were again too low , should go up . This time , however , the Presidential edict seemed to have lost its magic . Despite renewed inflation in the form of desterilized gold and relaxed bank reserve requirements , commodity prices on June i reached the lowest point since 1934-130 on Moody 's Index . <P> The present low level of commodity prices not only chills business confidence and causes inventory losses but slows public buying in anticipation of still lower prices . Result is a general stagnation which continues @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ renewed , forcing prices to turn upward . Last week , Standard Statistics saw no sign of U. S. business reaching this fundamental crossroad in the immediate future . Neither did Colonel Leonard Porter Ayres in his monthly sound-off . True , solid gains in crop prices on the report of bad weather and rust jumped Moody 's commodity index to 136 last week . But a 25 drop brought the listed price of steel scrap to $10.75 a ton , positive proof that the key industry of steel had no immediate upsurge ahead . And the stock market last week again turned down without even approaching the 121 level on the industrial averages , penetration of which Dow theorists would have considered significant . <P> Among other items in last week 's price news were two which surely pleased Franklin Roosevelt , one which offered some hope of business improvement : 1 ) The price of galvanized steel sheet was cut $3 a ton . Steel is one thing that Franklin Roosevelt still considers too costly and he has often remarked that the steel industry will not revive until prices @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any in the country and this opinion bounced off steelmasters like BB shot off a tank . Last week it seemed that where Franklin Roosevelt had failed to dent their determination , continued bad times might succeed . 2 ) Building material prices last week hit a new low since 1936 . In Franklin Roosevelt 's last lecture on prices he remarked that a sharp increase in building costs last year nipped a promising building boom . Probably the most optimistic sign on the U. S. business horizon last week was the fact that building contracts in May were 27.5% over April 1938 and 16% over May 1937.
