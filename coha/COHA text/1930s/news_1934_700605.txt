txt Taxation Methods . Dr. Abraham Lefkowitz of the Teachers Union says that " taxes should be levied where there is an ability to pay " and that he " would like to see this administration go out where the wealth is and tax it its just share . " When business has already paid , in the form of rent for space occupied , its just share in the cost of government services and benefits , does mere ability to I make a further payment justify additional demands by tax  --  collectors ? Is n't it a communistic notion that earned " wealth " should be seized upon to pay public expenses ? Why not limit such expenditures to the amount which can be collected-as land rent from site owners , they in turn to collect the necessary sums of money from their tenants ? Business would then be free from the constant imposition of newfangled taxes and could go full.speed ahead , while public economy would become a reality instead of a will-o ' - the- wisp .
