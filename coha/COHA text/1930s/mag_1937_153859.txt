Henchmen of Minister President General Hermann Wilhelm Gring , autocrat of the German Four-Year Plan of Rearmament and Autarchy , have long since occupied the Ministry of Economics ( TIME , Sept. 27 et seq. ) , yet Berlin correspondents have been unable to get confirmation that Reichsbank President Dr. Hjalmar Schacht has actually resigned as Minister of Economics . Last week Dr. Schacht went to a cocktail party staged in farewell to U. S. Consul General Douglas Jenkins who is being transferred from Berlin to London . <P> " You and all these rumors are causing us a lot of trouble , " a correspondent said to Dr. Schacht . <P> " What rumors ? " <P> " Well , many of your countrymen say you are resigning . " <P> " If they say that , it is right ! " barked Hjalmar Schacht . " I have resigned ! It may be announced officially today or tomorrow . I have not been at my office at the Ministry of Economics since Aug.11 . " <P> " Are you resigning as president of the Reichsbank too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Schacht whose term as president of the Reichsbank expires next March . <P> Three whole days later Berlin correspondents still were unable to get any official German source to confirm that Dr. Schacht is no longer Minister of Economics . Apparently mystic Adolf Hitler wants to keep for Germany the talismanic kudos of the Schacht name in the world of international finance , while at the same time permitting General Gring to indulge in expenditures for rearmament on a scale Dr. Schacht has warned is beyond the practical limits of Germany 's resources . From 1 p. m. until 6 p. m. one day last week General Gring conferred with the Fhrer , reputedly about accepting Dr. Schacht 's resignation , without result . In vain resident U. S. wits filled in the vacuum of Herr Hitler 's indecision by wisecracking : " Der Fhrer has fired the Schacht heard ' round the world . "
