RETURN OF THE NATIVE A STORY BY LLOYD MORRIS A FTER Bridgeport the train became a local , winding slowly along the Naugatuck valley . Drab mill towns succeeded one another , each a monotonous repetition of the last . At every one the train halted , amiably , as if paying a visit long overdue . In the torrid smoker Bruce Kinsolving crumpled the New York papers and cursed the heat . This was a hell of a homecoming . Home ? . . . Kinsolving glanced out the greasy window . Looking out at the familiar Connecticut landscape , he tried to whip up some emotion about it . But all that he felt was the bristly persistent plush eating into his damp flesh . Between the patches of desolation at which the train stopped the landscape was rather more than pleasant . It had a homespun charm in the waning light of this June evening . Clumps of wood along a rocky riverbed . White farmhouses , with orchards behind them and lilacs in front . From time to time masses of rose or white @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been born and brought up in it . He shifted his itching posterior . The two stout , shirt-sleeved men in the seat ahead of him were arguing about a milk strike . Across the aisle a colored laborer was snoring , firmly clutching a stinking pipe . A very blonde girl down the car was " kidding " the lanky conductor . The airreeked of sweat , stale smoke , and something like orange-peel . There was a baby in the car . It kept whining fretfully . In Paris Kinsolving had looked forward eagerly to the trip up from New York . Well , there was still plenty of time in which to get sentimental about scenes of childhood . At Torrington he would have to look sharp for a taxi . Doctor Chamberlain would not be likely to meet him . Why should he sacrifice his dinner-hour to welcoming his friend 's nephew and heir ? A ten-mile drive over the hills to New Haddam . As the taxi crawled up the steep ascent to the Common , maybe he would feel the anticipated thrill . A sharp @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old church . An image of it , rising uninvited in the Boulevard Saint Germain , had started him across three thousand miles of ocean . It had been a symbol . It had represented Ncw Haddam , and the town exemplified those specifically American qualities which long residence abroad had taught him to admire . He had tried to interpret them to his Parisian friends by describing the town . Old , stately mansions on wide , elm-shaded streets . He had let himself go about the houses , recalling delicate moldings , noble doorways , intricate balustrades of wrought iron . They implied a tradition in living , he had said , an ele-gance , a kind of serenity . Difficult to define , perhaps , but , nevertheless , a positive heritage . His Parisian friends listened politely , but he had sensed their incredulity . This obsolete village did n't represent the America they wanted to know . Why did n't he tell them about ' 011ywood ? The train was running parallel to the state road . Kinsolving saw a yellow motor van lettered @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a scarlet gas-station and refreshment stand , hot barkers , cream soda , toasted sandwiches . . . . Home . Or was home the comfortable , shabby studio round the corner from Saint-Germain-desPres ? It had n't seemed so one morning scarcely a month back . He had taken his letters from the concierge and gone to his usual table on the terrasse to read them . A warm , bright May morning , with air washed by recent rain , and the Boulevard gay , sparkling . He had glanced at the Herald and Matin , then turned to his letters . Two or three unimportant notes , then Doctor Chamberlain 's letter , announcing the death of his uncle , Bristow Kinsolving , and the doctor 's appointment as executor . The will made Bruce Kinsolving residuary legatee . He would have the house and a substantial capital . If Bruce Kinsolving intended to remain abroad the house could be rented . People from New York had been making inquiries about it . At that point Kinsolving had put aside the letter , as if actually before his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the old church at New Haddam . " That disposes of everything , I guess , " Doctor Chamberlain concluded and pushed the excellent port round once again . Bruce Kinsolving nodded , pouring from a fragile Waterford decanter . Everything had turned out splendidly . The doctor had met him , brought him home to dinner , and taken a room for him at the Tavern . The dinner and wine had been perfect , so were his host 's Chippendale , Spode , and Revere candlesticks . This was precisely the kind of thing which he had tried to explain to his Parisian friends . " Except one thing , " Doctor Chamberlain added . " I 've had another letter from the Dravitts , those New York people who want to buy your house . They 're rich . I 'm told that Dravitt rolled up his fortune on the short side of the market . - . Well , they want your house at any price . That 's about what it comes to . Socially ambitious , I suppose . What about it , Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Better think it over , my boy . You may not really like it here , you know . And , in that case . . . " Kinsolving shook his head . " I like it too well already , thanks to youl It 's very good to be home , after ten years . The house is n't for sale . " Doctor Chamberlain smiled . " I 'm glad to hear it , " he exclaimed cordially . " Well , then , I 've bad my say . . . . By the way , wo n't you be wanting a piano ? Bristow never had one . " " I arranged for one yesterday in New York , " Kinsolving told him . " It 'll be here at the end of the week . Then I 'll have to begin work . " " More port ? No ? " Doctor Chamberlain stoppered the decanter and crushed out his cigarette . " I 'd like to hear you play , Bruce . Sometime after your piano comes maybe . Or you might try @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your recitals in Paris and London , and I 've seen mention of your tone poem and string quartette . I do n't suppose I should understand ' em , however . Debussy is about my last outpost . " Kinsolving laughed . " The extreme moderns are going back to Bach and Mozart , " he said . " Why , Stravinsky himself . . . " He broke off , and asked , " Where 's your piano , Doctor ? I 'll play for you right now . " He was pleased by the old gentleman 's surprise . Doctor Chamberlain pushed back his chair and seized two candlesticks . " These will light the piano . This way , my boy . " Kinsolving followed him into the dark drawing-room . Doctor Chamberlain disposed the candlesticks , uncovered the keyboard of the piano , and lifted the lid . " They 've left the windows open , " he said . " You do n't object ? Fine ! sit at the other end of the room . Pretend that you 're alone . " He moved @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " It 's thick with fog outside . " Kinsolving seated himself at the keyboard , struck a chord . Tone and action were excellent . He waited for a moment . Then he began to play . An hour later , Doctor Chamberlain ceremoniously accompanied him to the front door . " You ca n't see a foot ahead of you . But you know the way , Bruce . Good-night , my boy . Thank you for playing . " Kinsolving descended five steps to the path . He heard the front door close behind him and began cautiously to explore his way to the gate . Presendy he heard the gate click , and footsteps on the pavement . But when , having reached the street , he tried to see who had left the doctor 's lawn , no one was visible . Even the light footsteps had been swallowed by the fog . Someone had evidently stopped to listen to him play . It was , he felt , a good omen . At the end of a month his unknown auditor still lingered in Kinsolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and gratifying . It was an unconfirmed augury . During his first busy weeks he had believed it to be prophetic of New Haddam 's recognition of him . It was n't as if he were asking the impossible . All that he wanted was normal acceptance . Surely the town could n't help being aware that he had made something of himself , that his compositions had been enthusiastically praised by European critics , that his recitals in London , Paris , and Vienna had drawn large audiences . But he had had no indication that New Haddam knew anything of the kind . Even the weekly Clarion had failed to play up the usual " home-town boy makes good " story . It had reported his occupancy of Bristow Kinsolving 's house , and then continued with a column about his ancestors , the Revolutionary general and Civil War governor . Kinsolving 's bewilderment had given way to fury . For the Clarion he was only an insignificant footnote to local history . Malicious , grudging , or merely ignorant ? He could n't make up his mind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . They were n't lacking in cordiality . But presumably they had decided to ignore his ten years ' absence and the prestige that he had achieved . The postal-clerk , the dog-warden , and the chemist had been his classmates at school . When he met them they grinned and shouted , " Hi , there , Bruce ! " But they never referred to his residence abroad . So far as they were concerned , he might never have left town , It would have relieved hint if they had even questioned him about the girls and the wickedness of Paris . He had listened to them report on their hot week-ends in Bridgeport . .. . Had there been deliberate malice in old Miss Markham 's refusal to lend him books front the Memorial Library until he had produced references ? People did say that her memory was beginning to fail . And that pair of old dowagers on the porch of the Country Clubl As he passed , one had asked the other to identify him . " Tchkl Tchkl Of course you remember him . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer fish ! " But although ignored as an artist , he was quickly reminded of the privileges due a Kinsolving . The first families of New Haddam welcomed him home , as they might an unfortunate prodigal , by pretending that he had never deserted it . Their invitations to dine and play bridge were informal and neighborly . In six stately , pre-Revolutionary mansions Kinsolving was informed about the financial condition of the Country Club , about the railway 's project to abandon its freight spur , about gardens . Above all , about gardens ! A turbid aura of annuals , perennials , and herbaceous borders hovered round these dinners . An unfamiliar rock-plant was capable of producing a violent disturbance . But he , Bruce Kinsolving , fresh from European triumphs , did n't make a ripple . Paris ? New Haddam took it calmly . The Meurice , for a fortnight , en route to Aix or Vichy . It was loyal to Worth and Doucet , the cuisine of Foyot , and the admirable diction of Madame Sorel . It had not even heard of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Picasso , Cocteau , and Stravinsky ; the Boeuf-sur-le-toit . At the Hallowell Danas ' Kinsolving tried to meet this emergency . He told an anecdote about Picasso and Gertrude Stein . He described the last drag-ball at Magic City , where there had been thousands of roughnecks dressed like Mistinguett . He spoke of the Princesse de Polignac 's winter musicale , at which he 'd played an impromptu duet with Stravinsky . He stopped to chilly silence . Then , from the end of thetable , Mrs. Dana 's voice resourcefully saying , " The first thing I do when I land in Paris is go to Rumpelmayer 's for some of those marvellous little cakes . " Kinsolving left the Hallowell Danas ' with Wesley Bricker , who ran the antique shop and tea room on the Common . Bricker was middle-aged and melancholy . In their five minutes ' walk Kinsolving learned that Bricker made annual trips to Paris , frequented the bar of the Boeuf , had once been presented to Jean Cocteau . Flutteringly , Bricker mentioned that he had attended one of Kinsolving 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Common , Bricker said , " Do come in some day , for tea . We have very good prune-whip . And we 'll have a talk about Paris . " Suddenly , Kinsolving realized that he was desperately lonely . On the Fourth of July the first families of New Haddam always dine at the Country Club . After dinner there is an expensive display of fireworks . The first families never forget that colonial independence was the private hobby of their ancestors . The day dawned sultry , as always , saluted by an ancient cannon on the Common . Exercises were held by the Boy Scouts and a handful of war veterans . The file department paraded . The Common rang with martial music , mostly off-key . In the shade of his uncle 's library Kinsolving fidgeted . The day yawned before him without distraction . bripossikole to work with that damned racket going on . All afternoon there would be firecrackers exploding , and in the evening , the Country Club . He had promised old Mrs. Barclay Tyler the pleasure of his company . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ little before eight Kinsolving set off in his roadster . Last year he had been staying with friends at Bandol , and on the fourteenth of July they had all gone into Toulon . What a nightl The Quai de Cronstadt swarming with people . Festivity in the air . Sailors dancing with their girls to the blare of accordions , in front of the caf  --  s . The town was heady with rut . . . And to-nightl A dreary dinner with stodgy people . A crowd of well-bred Americans , earnestly trying to have a good time . If it was possible to have a good time in America , a good time like those he always had in France , Kinsolving did n't know where to find it . The back streets of Bridgeport would n't furnish the equivalent of Toulon . Under the quizzical eye of his hostess , Kinsolving hastily swallowed three cocktails . Then he found his place at table . He noticed with dismay the inevitable paper caps and streamers , but , with quick relief , that he had never met the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and he saw that she was pretty . Dark ; rather wistful eyes ; about twenty-six . Pretty , he amended , in a fragile way . Blue blood thinning down after a century or so . There was something odd about her expression . Frustration ? Boredom ? Disappointment ? He let it go at that . She spoke first . " We used to know each other years ago . I 'm Elinor Haviland . You played tennis with my cousins . " He smiled , disappointed in his hope of novelty . Her name told him all , though his onlyvcollection of her was as a sober little nuisance in pigtails . " Yes , of course , " he assented . " We would know one another , would n't we ? Does n't anyone new ever come to this town ? " " What about yourself ? " she retorted . " Me ? I 've been here only five generations , like everyone else . " " But you 're new , " she said . " It has them all worried . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has known me from childhood . And most of them knew my ancestors . " " Sure , " she agreed . " But you 've broken the pattern . You 've escaped from the cage . Well , they 're uneasy with you . They ought to know you as intimately as they know everyone else here . But they do n't know you at all . " It broke upon him with the glare of sudden light . " So that 's why . . . " he began . She nodded . " Were n't you wise to it ? They 'd Like to make you feel at home . You see , I understand . I 'm rather in your class . That 's why Cousin Deborah seated us together . She 's done her best for both of us  --  and the others ! " " But I do n't see .. . " " Oh , be your age ! " She lighted a cigarette . " They 've heard that you 're something of a celebrity . But they remember you as Mr. Kinsolving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do ? " He changed the subject quickly . " What puts you in my class ? " She looked at him mockingly . " You 're thinking of those pigtails . But I 've changed , too . I 've stepped out , some . Enough to make them suspicious . It does n't take much . " " Meaning what ? " he prodded her . " Theater , among other things . Three weeks of summer stock in Danbury . And I played with a repertory company in New York  --  while it lasted . They came from Chicago and were very highbrow . Ibsen , Tchekov , you know . That 's why mother let me do it . You remember mother ? " Kinsolving did . Fifteen , even twenty years ago , Mrs. Haviland had been a formidable old lady . He thought he understood the girl 's puzzling ex-RETURN OF pression . Chained to mother . Why had n't she married ? She must have money of her own . . " Is your mother here to-night ? " " Near the end of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Kinsolving glanced there . Naturally ! The dowager who had identified him on the porch of this club . He turned back to the girl . " Your mother dislikes me , I believe . " " Right . What about it ? You do n't want to seduce her , do you ? " He dodged this flippancy . " Can you tell me why she does ? " Elinor Haviland pondered this a moment . " Probably , " she said , " be- cause she thinks you eccentric . If 1 you were only a celebrity they could snub you . But you 're a Kinsolving , so they ca n't . Mother included . " " That 's a mercy , " he acknowledged . " Let 's drink my gratitude to old Israel Kinsolving , who did n't get killed at Bunker Hill . You mean that your mother ca n't snub him . And to think that , in Europe , I always thought of this town as home ! " " It 's not the worst place . . . " She paused , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about a month ago , at Doctor Chamberlain 's ? One night , when there was a fog ? " He nodded . " What was the last thing you played ? " " So it was you . . . listening out there on the lawn ? " " Me and the dog . What was the piece ? " " A ballade by Chopin . Why ? " " Because , boy , you got under my tanned hide with it . " Kinsolving felt the flush of pleasure . The omen had been fulfilled . To his own amusement , Kinsolving began to pity Mrs. Haviland . She did n't like him and refused to pretend that she did . Ancestrally eligi-ble , but personally suspect : she must be finding him a difficult moisell Yet he was being served to her almost daily . Elinor seemed completely indifferent to the bristling , unspoken protests which his presence provoked from her mother . Sometimes he wondered what Mrs. Haviland would say if she knew the truth . New Haddam , Kinsolving imagined , interpreted his conduct as courtship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Elinor surely knew this , but it did n't seem to worry her . In a cool , imperturbable fashion , she was enjoying their little affair , but not taking it seriously . Rather to his own astonishment , Kin-solving found himself about to become involved . The more he meditated , the more arguments he found in favor of marrying Elinor . She was amusing , emancipated , and a hard-boiled realist . Sometimes that embarrassed him , but on the whole it saved him trouble . If they married she would n't expect too much from him . And together they might rouse the social life of the town from its torpor . One evening , under compunction for his neglect , Kinsolving paid a call on Doctor Chamberlain . The doctor , he noticed , regarded him a trifle curiously , and he braced himself for an inconvenient question . But the good doctor struck off into the safe channel of music and resolutely stayed there . Half an hour passed , an hour . Whiskey and soda were brought . Another half hour . Kinsolving prepared @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You 're looking seedy , Bruce . I 'd say you were .. . well , bored and restless or feeling stale . Better look to yourself , my boyl " Kinsolving said , " I do n't feel it , you know . " " I 've always wondered , " Doctor Chamberlain proceeded , " whether you 're finding it congenial here . " " You were doubtful about it the night of my arrival , " Kinsolving reminded him . " I told you then that it was home . " " Mmm . . . Of course , I 'm glad for that . I 'd miss you if you left here . You 're one of the few people whom I can talk to . " Doctor Chamberlain paused , as if awaiting some comment . When none came , he continued , " That 's just what 's the matter with this town . If there were only more people here like you and myself . . " " There 's Elinor Haviland , " Kin-solving hazarded , to draw him . " Little rip @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " By and large , we 're museum specimens . Last relics of a vanished civilization , untouched by the living present , making a cult of our ancestors and their houses . This whole damned town is living in the past . It 's all right for me . I 'm a dilettant , if you like . But for you , Bruce " ? he puffed at his cigar ? " if you 're half the artist I think you may be , it 's nothing for you . " " But , look here , Doctor .. . " " Oh , it 's none of my business , " Doctor Chamberlain assured him . " But if you 're showing the symptoms of dry-rot , you 'd best diagnose them correctly . I never forget that this town is an anachronism . There 's a living world outside , but we 've excluded it and all it stands for . Do n't make any mistake about that , my boy . " Later , when he pondered what Doctor Chamberlain had said , Kinsolving began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had completely failed to accomplish any work that satisfied him . The springs of composition had simply dried up . He had gone stale . At the root of his restlessness , his discontent , was this terrifying sterility . A few days after his visit to the doctor Kinsolving received a call from Mrs. Hallowell Dana . After skirmishing for a while she came to the point . Would n't he give a recital at the Country Club for the benefit of the Memorial Library ? Of course , they had usually had amateur theatricals , but since he had returned to the old home . . . with his great reputation . . European concerts , and all . In short , would n't he play ? The town would like to hear him . Mrs. Hallowell Dana was obviously bewildered by his prompt assent . This was his chance , he felt , to retrieve himself as an artist . So for the next fortnight he shut himself away , and saw Elinor only twice . In the excitement of practice he scarcely missed her . She told @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dispelled the last vestiges of suspicion . The whole town was now pronouncing him a splendid fellow and speaking with pride of his European exploits . He recalled how much he would have valued the belated verdict had it come a little earlier . Still it broke ground for the future . . . He would ask Elinor to marry him immediately after the recital . When the evening of the recital came Kinsolving was nervous and irritable . It did n't help to remember that his audience would n't be critical . The occasion was , in a way , symbolic . It was his opportunity to force the recognition that New Haddam had refused him . And anything short of a brilliant performance might mean failure . The apprehension of an ordeal hung over him . He told himself that he was being absurd : he had European laurels which New Haddam could n't wither . No use . His nervous state was the price he paid for being an incurable sentimentalist . Had n't he crossed the Atlantic because of a memory of some architecture ? When he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with RETURN OF a Chopin prelude , and the first notes told him that he would play as well as ever before . A sea of familiar faces surged up at him , then fell away . A breathless hush at the end of his first group . Then rattling applause . He forgot the audience , forgot his motive in playing to them , forgot the urgent necessity to play well , forgot Elinor . For the first time since his return he had recaptured his old sense of living intensely , of functioning completely . A feeling of happiness welled up in him . It was not until his last encore that it receded , leaving him free to step off the platform and into the habit of his daily life . And only then it flashed on him that this habit was an odd one , perhaps not really his . He escaped as quickly as possible from the usual appreciative crowd and joined Elinor , awaiting him in her car . It was a soft night , and a great amber moon was hanging low . Elinor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ town and took a road out to the hills . Kinsolving sank back lazily , closed his eyes , and waited for the tingling excitement to subside . After a while , Elinor brought the car to a halt . They were on the crest of a hill , and below them a valley was flooded with moonlight . Elinor turned to him . " It was swell , Bruce . You certainly can play . " He roused himself to the anticipated moment . He had thought of all the ways of speaking to her , but what he said was , " Why not let 's marry , Elinor ? " Her giggle startled him . " Elinor ! " The giggle went on . He waited . " Bruce , you 're not a bad egg . But do n't be a damned fool . We 've had a swell time  --  while it lasted . But that 's over now . If it had n't been for your concert I 'd have told you before . " " Elinor ! " He grabbed her arm . She @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , can you ? Do n't be silly , Bruce . " " But I do n't understand , " he said . " Well , what of it ? " She put her foot on the starter and the car responded with a low throbbing . " Not a bad view , " she said , and started the car downward into the valley of moonlight . In his uncle 's library , an hour later , Bruce Kinsolving crumpled up the New York paper . The Ile de France was sailing in five days . He would have to see Doctor Chamberlain in the morning . Those New York people could have the house if they still wanted it . And he hoped they 'd be thoroughly common . He leaned back in his chair , closed his eyes . The Boulevard Saint Ger . main under a mild September sun . The old church , dark gray and white , with the pigeons wheeling around its spire . He could almost smell the Paris odor of asphalt and gasoline . The concierge would have his studio ready for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
