According to John Van de Poele , Massachusetts ' Chief Bee Inspector , at least 17 people were stung to death by bees in New England last year . Inspector Van de Poele , who wears a bathing suit while tending his own bees , has been stung almost daily for eleven years , considers himself totally immune to bee poison. * But physicians say that , like other persons who have developed ordinary bee immunity , he too could be killed instantly by a single sting on a vulnerable spot , the jugular vein , perhaps , or a major nerve . <P> One evening last week Apiarist Van de Poele went to Boston 's Radio Station WEEI to talk about bees , took along a hive of 30,000 bees for sound effect . Nervous after his microphone ordeal , he struck the hive against a studio door , dropped it . Out with a horrid hum swarmed all 30,000 bees . While spectators and staff members fled , the beeman valiantly scooped his charges back into the studio with bare bands , slammed the door . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ release the bee-maddening smell of a squashed bee , he herded most of the insects back into their hive . Later he returned with a smoke gun and vacuum sweeper to clean up . About 5,000 bees died in the process . From his body Apiarist Van de Poele , who suffered not so much as a swelling , calmly removed some 300 stingers . <P> <P> *Imperfectly understood , death by bee sting is thought due to a special poison secreted by particular insects , possibly diseased . Apisination should be treated by gently removing the stinger , washing the wound with a weak solution of ammonia or soda , applying antiseptic . Bleeding should be encouraged .
