Last week in Cardiff , Wales , Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain told 10,000 followers that he was no seer , that if they wanted to know what the future had in store for Europe they might as well go to Old Moore , the astrologer-author of a popular British almanac , as to ask the Head of the British Government . Others with far less opportunity for knowing what was going on in Europe were not so modest . <P> On the eve of Sarajevo 's 25th anniversary , they saw on the European horizon signs aplenty that the old war-ridden continent was again facing nerve-wracking summer days of crisis . <P> In Germany an unprecedented peace time mobilization of 2,000,000 men was under way . Division after division moved into the Limes Line , there to face the French poilus long ago shoved into the Maginot Line . Into East Prussia , already an armed camp , went more antiaircraft regiments , and a narrow strip along the border of Poland 's vital southern indus trial area was closed to civilians . Reports persisted that a few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a moral stimulant to their Nazi brothers . <P> Polish soldiers , weary of inaction after three straight months in uniform , watched across the Danzig border as Nazis in the Free City got ever bolder . <P> Italy announced the biggest maneuvers of her history , to be climaxed with a sham " Battle of the Po " in the North . The Fascists made no bones about naming the invader : the French . Lest scheduled naval maneuvers in September heighten the chances for a crisis in that fateful month , Great Britain advanced her fall sea games to August when sailors presumably may play without trepidation . <P> As more and more reservists were called up , statesmen , politicians , journalists and generals hauled out their big oratorical guns for what promised to be a screaming international debate . At Verdun , where 23 years ago this week the French defenders were repulsing the attacking Germans , the usually silent General Maurice Gustave Gamelin , commander-in-chief of all French armed forces , said that " respect can not be bought with concessions . " French Foreign @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " spectre of war " haunting Europe , came right out and pleaded with the U. S. to remove war fears by joining the British-French Peace Front . <P> Political Journalist Andre Geraud ( Per-tinax ) viewed German mobilization as a prelude to war , reported that the usually peaceful Prussian militarists were now won over to action . <P> Vladimir Poliakoff ( Augur ) , White Russian newspaperman who snoops around odd corners of European chancelleries and sometimes pulls out something good , last week reported to the New York Times that British Foreign Secretary Viscount Halifax had sent , through an unnamed emissary , to German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop an odd but simple and direct message : " If you want war you can have war . " Almost as defiant was Prime Minister Chamberlain , who delivered the most direct warning he has yet given to the Reich and boasted about Britain 's newly found military power .
