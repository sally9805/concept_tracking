Mary Ritter Beard has spent much of her life writing U. S. history , notably The Rise of American Civilization in collaboration with her famed husband , Charles Austin Beard . In Washington last week U. S. history in the making touched Author Beard when the Senate sat to try the 13th Federal impeachment in Congress ' 147 years . The defendant : Mrs. Beard 's brother , Federal District Judge Halsted L. Ritter of Florida . <P> " Hear ye ! Hear ye ! Hear ye ! " cried the Senate 's portly Sergeant at Arms Chesley W. Jurney . " All persons are commanded to keep silence , on pain of imprisonment , while the Senate of the United States is sitting for the trial of the articles of impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives against Halsted L. Ritter , United States district judge for the southern district of Florida . " <P> When the 13th impeachment was voted by the House last month ( TIME , March 16 ) , Chairman Hatton W. Summers of the House Judiciary Committee declared that Senate proceedings in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Louderback in 1933 , had been " the greatest farce ever presented . " At one point 93 out of 96 Senators were absent from performance of their rarest and highest Constitutional function . Washington still believes that Judge Louderback was acquitted partly because many a Senator declined to vote guilty on evidence which he had not heard . Last week , stung by Chairman Summers ' rebuke , 82 Senators were in their chairs when the Ritter trial began . <P> Halsted L. Ritter , 67 , moved to Florida in 1925 for his wife 's health , four years later was appointed to the Federal bench by President Coolidge . Chief of the " high crimes and misdemeanors ' ' with which the House charged him last week was that , as party to a champertous proceeding , he had " corruptly and unlawfully " received $4,500 from his onetime law partner , Albert L. Rankin . Champerty , it was explained for the benefit of nonlawyer Senators , is a proceeding whereby a person having no legitimate interest in a law suit abets it with money or services @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ managers asserted , had connived with his onetime partner and others to throw Whitehall , a Palm Beach hotel , into receivership , had thereupon granted Lawyer Rankin an exorbitant fee of $75,000 , got $4,500 of it for himself . <P> Other charges were that Judge Ritter had practiced law after mounting the bench , filed false income tax returns for 1929 and 1930 , accepted free meals &; lodging at the Whitehall during receivership proceedings . <P> Chief defense attorney was brilliant , liberal Frank P. Walsh , who has made his name &; fame by dramatic defenses of everybody from Edward L. Doheny to Tom Mooney . Of the three House managers , Alabama 's chunky Sam Hobbs bore the brunt of the prosecution . <P> Throughout the six days of complex , technical testimony , the Senator-jurors had the painful experience of being forced to sit virtually speechless . When they had questions to ask , they scratched them on pieces of paper , sent them up by page to the presiding officer . Witnesses had to stand while testifying . First to be called was Lawyer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ given Judge Ritter was payment on an honest debt-the sum for which he had bought out the assets of their partnership .
