In convention in Chicago last week gathered the men who control the third largest U. S. unmanufactured crop export . Largest is cotton , next is tobacco and third is the humble apple . To safeguard this precious fruit the International Apple Association met for the first time 42 years ago in Chicago 's Hotel Sherman . Last week , 1,400 strong , the applemen were back at the Sherman with apple problems on their minds , Les Apple Trees Glac on their tables and on their program plans for using the saga of Johnny Appleseed as a promotion scheme . <P> The patron saint of U. S. applemen , Johnny Appleseed , whose real name was Jonathan Chapman , was first recorded as a slim 25-year-old who in 1801 turned up in Licking County , Ohio , leading a packhorse laden with apple seed brought from a Pennsylvania cider mill . At suitable spots Johnny stopped to plant his seed in neat rows for the benefit of settlers to come. * Far in advance of the frontier he roamed , following Indian trails or pushing rude boats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the young trees . Soon the whole frontier knew him , gladly gave him shelter . With long hair flying and beard full of burrs , he would lope from the forest at evening , accept supper from a solitary homesteader , read aloud from the Bible or a volume of Swedenborg he usually carried , sleep on the hearth and be off at dawn , often leaving a few pages of his Bible behind him . Growing to believe that clothes were not for comfort but only to cover nakedness , he took to wearing a coffee sack with holes for his arms and legs . He ate no meat , lived chiefly on cornmeal mush . <P> Once in the War of 1812 he ran 60 miles in a day to warn settlers of an Indian raid . Finally , at 72 , he wandered to Fort Wayne , Ind . At a settler 's house near there , after hiking 20 miles , he lay down on the hearth to rise no more . <P> Applemen love Johnny , although they deplore his cultural methods , for presumably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . This year some 65,000,000 bbl. of apples will be produced in the U. S.-about four-fifths of world production and biggest U. S. yield in six years . This is a 60% increase over last year 's crop . Apples come in three types ( dessert , culinary , cider ) and some 7,500 U. S. varieties are grown on a large-scale in all but nine States. + New York once ( 1900-08 ) produced 50% of the crop , but Washington now leads , producing over a sixth of the total . New York and Virginia are rivals for second , the honor going to whichever gets the better weather . Before 1870 most growing was done by farmers with small orchards . Since then growing has gradually turned to larger and larger units . Commercial orchards now range from ten to 2,500 acres , with some 40 trees per acre . Most famed U. S. appleman is Senator Harry Flood Byrd , who has 5,000 acres in Virginia . Another big producer is American Fruit Growers , Inc. , which owns some 5,000 acres in the Pacific Northwest , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
