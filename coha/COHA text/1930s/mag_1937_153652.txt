In a year of great labor upheavals , last week 's ample budget of strikes all but constituted a lull . Many of them , like the Plymouth four-day walkout of 11,000 workers at Detroit , were caused by jurisdictional disease . Some of them , like the grave diggers of Kansas City who in one day kept ten bodies from burial , originated in nothing less prosaic than demands for union recognition , closed shop and wage increase . However , if strikes failed to make labor news , three utterances did : <P> " Frenzied Passion . " Four steel strikers were convicted for their part in the Republic Steel Corp . bombing in Warren , Ohio six weeks ago . In sentencing them Warren 's Common Pleas Court Judge Lynn B. Griffith rebuked them as much in the name of Labor as in the name of Law : " In your frenzied passion you have violated the law , insulted the dignity and decency of the State of Ohio , endangered the lives and property , and overwhelmed this peaceable and quiet community by your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ union in our land approves or condones the erratic course you have pur sued . You do not represent union labor in its struggles and aspirations . You represent a wayward and unstable element of society . . . . " <P> " Legal Nonentity . " United Automobile Workers of America asked the City of Dearborn for " legal protection " next time it wanted to hand out union literature at the Ford Motor Co. plant . Dearborn 's Attorney James E. Greene denied the ap plication . His opinion : <P> " We have carefully investigated and find no actual existence of such an organization , registered as an organization , as a firm , partnership , person or persons doing business under an assumed name by and in accordance with the statutes of the State . . . . We are forced to conclude that the named confederation on whose behalf you communicate with our Chief of Police is a legal nonentity . " <P> " Dictatorship . " Harry Bridges , president of the Pacific Coast District of the International Longshoremen 's Association and biggest figure in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of C.I.O. in the West . In Tacoma , Wash , the Long shoremen 's union not only refused to join C.I.O. but wrote to all I.L.A. locals on the Coast : <P> " . . . The membership of this local can not see what the C.I.O. has in any way to offer us . . . . The C.I.O. , having been in existence for two years , has as yet not organized itself as a central federation . It has had no convention . It has no constitution and bylaws , and appears to be what John L. Lewis or some other high-up says it is . It appears to be a dictatorship by a top committee which is all against the principles fought for and established by the component organizations of the Maritime Federation of the Pacific Coast .
