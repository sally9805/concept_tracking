There was some uncertainty as to whether the Charter Jubilee Art Show which got under way in Chicago last week was the largest such exhibit ever housed in one room , but everyone agreed that it was the longest . It was held on the second-floor gallery of Chicago 's Navy Pier , where that city 's proletariat is accustomed to flock on Sundays for recreation . Distance from the gallery 's west entrance to the far end is 1,300 ft. , and since the paintings hung on both walls a half-mile march was necessary to see them all . <P> Last fortnight all kinds of Chicago artists , from spick-and-span dandies in automobiles to tatterdemalions trudging along with their paintings under their arms , began to arrive at the pier at the foot of Grand Avenue . A one-and-one-half-ton truck carted the pictures into the gallery and husky young Negroes hung them up . They needed more than two miles of wire , 5,000 nails . At the press preview a Chevrolet sedan traveling from one end of the line to the other was at the disposal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Art Show ( Chicago got its city charter in 1837 ) was open to any Chicago artist regardless of credo and achievement . Each was invited to send two works . Some 500 painters hung 850 canvases , with a sprinkling of photographs , pastels , sculpture . All artists were requested to price their showings and almost all did so . Prices ranged from $1.50 for Gazelle ( sculpture ) to $10,000 for Typical Historical American Indian ( sculpture ) . On opening day , the show , which will run until Sept. 7 , attracted 2,000 visitors at 10 a head . At week 's end attendance stood at 3,500 , sales at $100 . <P> What critics chiefly noted , aside from , an extremely wide range of merit , was a truce in the bitter factionalism which has characterized Chicago art since modernism first burst upon it in 1913 . No one was heard of who refused to contribute because an enemy was represented , and painters with grim sociological messages did not stand off in a corner and poke fun at the " Sanity in Art @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wholesome snowscapes , landscapes , seascapes . Of abstract paintings there were only two . Geographical range was all the way from The Ninth Hole , Park Ridge Golf Club to Royal Castle , Sweden , Early Morning . Most puzzling title would have been S. Stake 's Chrycenthemen if his canvas had not depicted a recognizable flower . <P> Critics paid especial attention to Todros Geller 's swart , black-hooded Spanish Woman , to Macena Barton 's solid black-browed Rosana in Purple , to E. Millman 's Resting-two vagrants in a - phouse , one sitting on a barrel , the other lolling on a green mattress . Visitors stopped in swarms before L. J. Ambrose 's Debutante , a young lady wearing nothing but white slippers being presented by her bosomy mother to a group of starched top-hatted socialites ; and Michael Madsen 's Statue of Hercules in Action , a picture of two affectionate moppets inspecting a statue group which displays a woman with disarranged clothes being muscled along by three brawny policemen and one plainclothesman.              @ @ @ @ @ @ @
