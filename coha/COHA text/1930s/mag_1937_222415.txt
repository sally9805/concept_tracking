Grey curtains of rain trailed over the slates and chimney pots of London as the night-before-Coronation fell . Under the square miles of rooftops , in the slums and swank mansions , in suburban villas and the fine hotels , " Coronation " was the word most often on every lip as Greater London 's 8,000,000 inhabitants , plus at least 1,500,000 visitors from the provinces , from the Dominions and colonies , from the U. S. and from every country in Europe , Asia , South America , even from the larger States of India and tribes of British Africa , all thought and spoke and made last things ready for the great event of the morrow . London was like a gigantic brain , every cell of which was focussed on one central thought . Like parts of a vast body conditioned by that brain , the world-wide Empire pulsed and stirred to the same thought-Coronation , England 's 37th since William the Conqueror and the beginning of modern British history . <P> Squatting on a sand-bin in Whitehall , a 62-year-old Mrs. Heggs from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bottle of wine under her umbrella and declared : " I 'm used to these all-night waits . I sat up for 24 hours to watch his father 's Silver Jubilee procession . I claim to be the first arrival on the Coronation procession route . " <P> In one of the royal stables late in the evening , an old cream mare whinnied feebly , gasped for breath and died . She was Amazon Leader , last of the train of eight which had drawn George V to his Coronation 26 years before . <P> The rain dripped all night from miles of waterproofed flags and bunting . Last revelers from the gayest nightspots had not reached home before operators in the telephone exchanges began plugging in wake-up calls to subscribers . Ordinarily there are about 800 such calls in London , this morning there were 10,000 . It was barely light and still drizzling when the long streams of humanity began flowing in toward the heart of the spectacle , on foot , in motors , on the subways . . . . <P> On the Victoria Embankment , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ blue swarm into their places . Peter Suffren , 6 , with a row of tin medals on his chest and clutching a bottle of milk , a bag of potato chips , says : " I wish I had a princess for a girl . " <P> A curly-haired urchin drops his threepenny Coronation mug . It breaks , he sobs for his mother . Kind bystanders give him much more than three pennies . Sniveling he moves away , into another street to repeat the racket . <P> The route is now lined with soldiers giving their buttons a last polish with their cuffs . Out of the corner of his mouth one of them says to an old lady in the crowd : ' ' Why do n't you join the Army , Ma ? You 'd get a better view . . . .
