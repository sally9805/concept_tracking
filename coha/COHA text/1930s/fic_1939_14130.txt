CLEMENTINE Yes 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You might try Sybil 's . He loves Sybil 's . It reminds him of Paris .

( As Sybil 's answers ) Hello , is dis Sybil 's ? ( LINDA pauses at upstage end of desk and looks at CLEMENTINE expectantly ) Is Mr. Easterbrook dere ?  --  ( CLEMENTINE 'S voice registers disappointment at the reply from the other end ) Well , has he been dere today ?  --  ( LINDA goes to the window , stands in front of it and takes in the panorama of New York ) Well , when @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away , please . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Over her shoulder ) Say it 's important . CLEMENTINE ( Into phone ) It 's very important ! ( Hangs up . Then looks at LINDA ) He ai n't been to Sybil 's . He ai n't no place ! ( Checks Sybil 's on the list and glances over the uncalled numbers ) I wonder where dat contrary man can be today ? LINDA EASTERBROOK You might try the studio again .

CLEMENTINE nods , glances at the list and dials ) How do you like " The School for Scandal , " Clementine ? ( Leafs through the pages of the manuscript . ) CLEMENTINE ( As she awaits answer on other end ) Oh , it 's got a lot of dat old-fashioned language  --  but it 's kind of snappy !

CLEMENTINE speaks into receiver ) Hello  --  Gotham Athletic ?  --  Will you connect me wid de bar , please  --  ( Picks up the copy of the book ) Everybody sleepin ' aroun ' wid everybody else  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in dem days ? p. 6 LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's famous  --  it 's a classic .

CLEMENTINE Dat 's jest what I say about my Joe on Saturday nights  --  the hell wid him ! ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vase on the table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Laughs ) Nice to have it timed for you like that . ( The TELEPHONE on the desk rings . ) CLEMENTINE ( Turns and hurries over to upstage end of desk . Overjoyed ) Oh , maybe he 's in de bar downstairs ! ( Picks up the receiver . LINDA looks at her expectantly ) Hello  --  yes  --  Oh ! ( CLEMENTINE is greatly dashed . LINDA resumes her reading ) Who wants Miss Paige ?

As CLEMENTINE finishes dialing number , the DOORBUZZER rings down the hall . Into the phone ) Hold on a minute , please  --  ( Pleaces the receiver on the table and goes up toward the C. door. ) p. 10 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( From her room ) Clementine ! CLEMENTINE ( Going into the hall ) Yes , Miss Lindy ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Close my door , please . CLEMENTINE Yes 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then goes along hall to off R. The front DOOR is heard being opened . CLEMENTINE 'S voice ) Come right in , please . PHILO SMITH Good evening ! ( The front DOOR is heard closing . PHILO SMITH appears in the hall . He throws his hat on the chair R. side of double door opening into LINDA 'S room , then enters the room and stands up L.C. looking about the room . PHILO is between 45 and 50 , quiet , keen-faced , pretty well possessed ; he has made his major decisions in life and no longer permits himself to be agitated much about anything . ) CLEMENTINE ( Enters behind PHILO and stands upstage R.C. ) Miss Paige 'll be right in , Mr. Smith . PHILO SMITH Thank you . CLEMENTINE Excuse me while I finishes up a phone call . p. 11 PHILO SMITH Yes , of course . ( He turns and goes slowly to above upstage end of the desk and takes a gold cigarette case from his pocket . ) CLEMENTINE ( Returns to behind the table R. ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ receiver ) Hello , is dis Murray 's ? Has Mr. Easterbrook been dere yet ? ( PHILO turns toward CLEMENTINE , takes a lighter from his pocket and lights his cigarette ) Is you sure he ai n't dere now ? ( PHILO turns away from her , moves down behind desk to lower end and examines photograph there ) Well , when he gits dere ask him to call his wife right away , please  --  it 's very important . ( Hangs up , then mutters to herself ) Oh , my goodness  --  ( Looks at the card , picks up receiver and starts to dial again . ) ( Linda re-enters from her room , closing the door behind her . She has changed to a street frock . She moves downstage , R. of the C. chair , to below it . PHILO goes below the sofa over to L. of her . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK How do you do ? ( To CLEMENTINE ) All right , Clementine . ( She shakes hands with PHILO ) I 'm very glad to see you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILO SMITH Thank you . CLEMENTINE ( Moves over to above L. end of the table ) He ai n't in Mac 's . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Faintly annoyed ) All right , Clementine . ( Turns a few steps up toward CLEMENTINE . ) CLEMENTINE He ai n't in Murray 's either . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Amused by this time ) All right , Clementine . CLEMENTINE ( Starts for door up C. ) An ' de list is most used up . ( Goes out into hall and off L. ) ( Linda turns down toward PHILO . ) PHILO SMITH ( A step toward her ) Well , you must be surprised at my visit . LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes , And very flattered . I came away from the Wylers ' dinner party the other night with the feeling that you 'd made me talk a good deal and that you 'd listened very little . PHILO SMITH You are mistaken . I am a hard listener . I remember everything you said . LINDA EASTERBROOK Very trivial . p. 13 PHILO SMITH I was extremely entertained . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't getting on . Will you have a highball ? PHILO SMITH Thank you . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Turns and goes to console up R. ) Scotch or rye ? PHILO SMITH ( Moves to below R. side of C. chair ) Scotch , please . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Picks up highball glass , digs in ice bowl with tongs and puts an ice cube in glass ) I remember particularly that you said you had never seen me act in a play . I remember particularly because you said it without any nuance of regret . ( Picks up scotch decanter , takes stopper from it , places stopper on tray , and pours liquor into glass . ) PHILO SMITH I shall not miss your next . When will that be ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Replaces the decanter on the tray ) God knows . Depends on my husband . ( Picks up metal seltzer bottle and squirts soda into the glass . ) PHILO SMITH Does your husband write all your plays ? p. 14 LINDA EASTERBROOK He 's written the last three . I became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what does an actress do  --  between plays ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Replaces seltzer bottle on the tray ) Worries about her next . Gets depressed . ( Moves down toward him ) Thinks she 's through . Looks in the mirror and thinks : Better get on with it  --  have a good time . Has a good time . ( Hands highball glass to him . ) PHILO SMITH The mirror should reassure you . LINDA EASTERBROOK Thank you very much . ( Gestures for him to be seated . PHILO goes below her over to the R. lounge chair . LINDA moves downstage a few steps and looks across toward the mirror on the L. wall ) But you do n't see what the mirror sees  --  thank God . ( Arranges her hair ) Art has intervened . ( Laughs a bit . He looks at her , does n't smile , then seats himself on the R. lounge . LINDA turns and moves to below the L. lounge chair . A moment 's pause ) But you 're making me talk again . ( Picks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lounge ) I 've got to draw you out . How shall I begin ? ( Sits on the I. lounge. ) p. 15 PHILO SMITH What would you like to know ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Another moment 's pause ) Well , why you came to see me this afternoon ? PHILO SMITH The other evening at the Wylers ' you invited me to tea . You said : Drop in for tea . LINDA EASTERBROOK Somehow I do n't believe this visit is impromptu . PHILO SMITH You are perfectly right . It is not . ( Drinks . A slight pause . He volunteers no more . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Well  --  I 'm very glad indeed you dropped in . I was in a wretched mood . PHILO SMITH I am sorry . LINDA EASTERBROOK Are you moody ? PHILO SMITH ( Emphatically . ) No . LINDA EASTERBROOK Never ? PHILO SMITH ( Same tone ) Never . LINDA EASTERBROOK You 're lucky ; it must be wonderful to keep on an even keel like that . How do you achieve it ? PHILO SMITH Discipline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) You are inscrutable  --  and that 's fascinating . p. 16 PHILO SMITH I am a business-man . The most despised variety , a banker . LINDA EASTERBROOK You have great power . There is something glamorous in that  --  just in the fact of power . PHILO SMITH What looks like power from the outside may be only a complex of strains and stresses from the inside . ( Drinks . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I met your wife for a moment the other evening  --  she is lovely . PHILO SMITH ( Looks at her . Tranquilly ) Do you imply she is one of the strains and stresses ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Laughs ) I do n't know in the least what made me speak of her just now . PHILO SMITH Your intuition . LINDA EASTERBROOK I am sorry . PHILO SMITH ( After a moment ) I had a letter the other day from my son  --  he 's at Harvard . He laid me out : by excelling and rising to the top in an evil system I am , he charged me , a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ defense ? PHILO SMITH I begged him not to blame the system on its inheritors . I told him I 'd be glad to run the revolution , for him as soon as it was established . ( Drinks ) I said I was just a simple socialist rich man like George Bernard Shaw . p. 17 LINDA EASTERBROOK Are you afraid of you son ? PHILO SMITH Desperately . ( She is amused . He is impassive . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I wish this visit were impromptu . PHILO SMITH Do you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . PHILO SMITH Why ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I Should like to think that you remembered me , were charmed by me  --  and wanted to see me again . PHILO SMITH ( Looks at her ) All that might be true  --  ( Looks away ) though I should not have come for those reasons . ( Starts to drink . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Why not ? Discipline ? PHILO SMITH ( Stops and looks at her ) Yes . ( Drinks . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I should hate to be so disciplined  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she has touched a delicate spot ) I 'm sorry . PHILO SMITH That might lead us into a philosophical discussion . Pleasure and pain . No point in that . p. 18 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Obediently ) Just as you like . ( Picks up a pencil from the table and glances at the telephone card lying there . ) PHILO SMITH Would you like to telephone ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks sharply at him ) You 're very keen . PHILO SMITH Please do . LINDA EASTERBROOK I have an errant husband . He 's between ideas . When he 's between ideas be makes an alcoholic tour of the town . ( Picks up the card ) It makes him forget he 's between ideas . ( Glances at the card ) This is a list of his haunts . It 's rather a game to track him down . PHILO SMITH Are they arranged alphabetically ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quickly ) No , but that 's a good idea . PHILO SMITH I heard the maid calling Murray 's . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Smiles ) Ah , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an infallible memory . ( Says it without pride , just as one might say : " I have a modest place in the country . " ) Recently in Washington my firm had to submit to investigation . I was on the stand being questioned by an eager but badly informed New Dealer . It caused a sensation because I happened to remember the price of steel rails in 1877 . I do n't know why they were so surprised but they were . ( Drinks. ) p. 19 LINDA EASTERBROOK Did you just happen to remember that year , or do you know the price for 1878 also ? PHILO SMITH I do . Shall I tell you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I do n't want to seem to pry . ( Is he serious ? Or is he amused with her ? She ca n't guite tell . ) PHILO SMITH What 's the next place on your list ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looking at the card ) An institution called the Blue Grotto . I have an irresistible conviction that he 's there . If he 's not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ catch him at the next . " It 's like chemin de fer . I should just , if you do n't mind  --  ( Rises and goes around L. end of lounge to behind the table ) like to call the Blue Grotto . PHILO SMITH I can save you the call . He 's not at the Blue Grotto . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Stops behind the table , L. of him . Amazed at his quiet assurance ) How do you know ? PHILO SMITH You might try  --  Regent 7-9777 . LINDA EASTERBROOK What place is that ? PHILO SMITH ( Looks at her ) It 's my house . p. 20 LINDA EASTERBROOK Really ! PHILO SMITH Yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK But  --  I do n't quite see  --  PHILO SMITH I told you my visit was not impromptu . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Studies him ) But I did n't know that Gay and your wife  --  ( Puts card down on the table ) Well , thank you very much . ( Goes to L. end of lounge ) I 'm greatly relieved . I 'm @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ PHILO SMITH You are very much in love with him ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks at him ) I am . How did you know ? PHILO SMITH The other evening at the Wylers ' you let it drop . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks away ) I talk too much . ( Sits on arm of L. lounge . ) PHILO SMITH Not for me . ( He drinks . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK But I did n't know that  --  ( Turns to him ) Gay never met your wife till that dinner at the Wylers ' , did he ? p. 21 PHILO SMITH He 's known her for several months . LINDA EASTERBROOK Really ? PHILO SMITH yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks away ) Stupid of him not to tell me . ( Looks at PHILO ) Your wife 's very charming  --  I should have loved to  --  She 's quite young , is n't she ? PHILO SMITH Yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK She 's not your only wife ? ( PHILO looks at her ) I mean  --  she is n't the mother of the boy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from her ) No. no  --  ( Glances a her , then drinks . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Smiles . Then after a moment ) How long have you been married ? PHILO SMITH Five years . LINDA EASTERBROOK Are you very much in love ? PHILO SMITH I should n't like to be divorced a second time . It gets to be undignified . LINDA EASTERBROOK Are n't you an alarmist , Mr. Smith ? p. 22 PHILO SMITH Do I look like an alarmist ? LINDA EASTERBROOK My dear Mr. Smith , I found your wife adorable to look at and very gracious . If my husband 's with her now having a pleasant time I am delighted . I 'd much rather have him with her than lushing at Jack and Charlie 's . PHILO SMITH That 's a speech and you do n't mean it . I beg of you , Miss Paige , not to be gallant . I dislike gallantry . ( Puts out his cigarette in ash tray on table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( A pause . She looks at him . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ SMITH Why ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Well , I have made and unmade up my mind about you several times since you came into the room . PHILO SMITH ( Looks away ) You do n't have to guess at random . I 'll tell you anything about myself you wish to know  --  ( Looks at her ) within reason . LINDA EASTERBROOK For one thing , I ca n't decide whether you have a sense of humor . PHILO SMITH Give yourself time . LINDA EASTERBROOK For a moment I thought you mellow . p. 23 PHILO SMITH Good God no ! I may be what is charitably known as middle-aged , but not mellow . ( Drinks . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Stands up and moves around lounge to below it ) Well , you are crusty . With a little provocation you might be disagreeable . ( Sits on lounge . ) PHILO SMITH You seem to lack the capacity to concentrate on one subject . ( Places the highball glass down on table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I can when the issue is critical . PHILO SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is critical . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) This is a curious interview . PHILO SMITH Why ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( With dignity ) Well , it would be more seemly to have taken place with your wife than with me . PHILO SMITH I do n't discuss things with my wife . We are beyond that stage . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( After a moment . Flatly ) Have you come here to tell me that my husband and your wife are having an affair ? p. 24 PHILO SMITH Not at all . In the first place that is unimportant . In the second place  --  though perhaps my wife still does n't suspect it and I am sure your husband does n't  --  the situation is far more dangerous than that . Really I have come here not to warn you but through you your husband . LINDA EASTERBROOK Of what ? PHILO SMITH ( After a moment ) Of being discovered . LINDA EASTERBROOK I beg your pardon . PHILO SMITH Quite casually my wife made about your husband a single remark . Knowing her as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the danger your husband is in . This remark impelled me to come here to warn you to warn him . I am interested in only two things in life , Miss Paige  --  my work and my hobby  --  and I do n't want them disrupted . I do n't want sensations , divorces or scandals . I want peace . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Unable to resist ) What is your hobby ? PHILO SMITH ( This time he is irritated ) You have a mania for the irrelevant . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Tranguilly ) Yes . I should have said , looking at you : " There 's a man who has no hobby . " I am delighted to find I am mistaken . What is it , Mr. Smith ? Do tell me. p. 25 PHILO SMITH Well , I am working on a History of Trade Routes up to 1700 . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quickly ) Sounds fascinating . PHILO SMITH Yes  --  it is so fascinating that I am jealous of taking time from it to testify in a divorce action . LINDA EASTERBROOK And @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remark ? PHILO SMITH Quite enough . And now I meet you , Miss Paige , now I talk to you , I realize that your position is really dangerous . For a woman like you my wife is the most dangerous possible sort of antagonist . LINDA EASTERBROOK Is she ? PHILO SMITH Yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) Well , what was the remark ? PHILO SMITH When she said of your husband that he had  --  latent possibilities as yet unrealized I knew that his position was perilous . My wife has a passion for developing latent possibilities .

As he is a very cautious man he is a bit troubled about having implied a personal interest ) Er  --  Yes .

She looks at her watch again . She implores God to damn her husband anyway . She decides not to put up with this mood , to drive it away .

LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Swings around to face the mirror on L. wall and arranges her hair ) As I am unlikely ever to act again , that might be considered an extravagance . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Picks up second section of the evening newspaper on desk , moves behind desk to upstage end of sofa and points gloomily to the pile of play scripts on desk ) What  --  ?

GAYLORD EASTERBROOK The hell with that . I 'm sick of that . It 's no time for that . LINDA EASTERBROOK There never was such a time . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK You live in an aura of exhibitionism or you could n't possibly say a thing like that . Look around you . Pick up a newspaper . Look at the world . How can I go on babbling lightly in a never-never land ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You underestimate yourself . Your plays are gay ; they 're gallant and witty . Occasionally they 're touching .

It 's an overdrawn back account . It 's finished . LINDA EASTERBROOK Every writer feels that once in a while .

GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) Darling , death is being rained from the sky on whole populations . ( Opens newspaper to the back page containing the picture section and holds it out for her to see ) Here  --  Look at the glamorous pictures in the papers ; next to the Spring fashions you see whole streetfuls of children in gas masks looking like monsters . What sort of a world is this ? ( Looks at her , then sits back and resumes his perusal of the paper ) And you expect me to sit in my room contriving stage situations for you to be witty in ! LINDA EASTERBROOK We can only laugh at our plight . That 's what distinguished us from the animals and the savages . They ca n't laugh ! Sometimes I think that we laugh less here in America than those in Europe right on the firing line . p. 39 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Reflectively ) Well , it 's all right to laugh under fire  --  that 's courage  --  but not sitting on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know much about history , but I imagine somewhere in the world there 's always been war .

( Replaces the letter opener on desk . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moodily as he folds the newspaper ) Well , you can keep them from exterminating you , I suppose . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK On the other hand , if they exterminate us , so much the worse for them . They 'll kill each other off or they 'll bore each other to death . We can only be as gay and delightful as we can right under their horrid snouts . ( Leans over and draws his handkerchief further from his breast pocket . After she finishes arranging the handkerchief he absentmindedly pushes it back completely into his pocket , then places the newspaper on the desk . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Morbidly ) Well , mix me a drink , will you , darling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Expresses utter boredom at the prospect as he sits back dejectedly in the corner of the sofa. ) p. 40 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks at him , smiles and pats his knee comfortingly , then rises and starts for the console ) You 're world-weary , are n't you , precious ? ( Begins to mix his drink . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes  --  ( She sings a few words of a Noel Coward song , then whistles a strain of it . He moves to downstage end of sofa , swings his legs up on it and reclines with his head resting against arm of sofa ) Why do you put up with me ? LINDA EASTERBROOK No choice . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Lots of choice . LINDA EASTERBROOK For instance  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Anybody . LINDA EASTERBROOK Do n't like him . ( Takes glass and the soda syphon down to table behind lounge chairs , squirts soda in glass and places the syphon down on the table . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK You 're a fool . LINDA EASTERBROOK Ummmm  --  - GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Meaning it ) If you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Moves over to R. of him ) Here , my tired philosopher . ( Hands the glass to him and mudges him . He shifts his feet to the floor , leaving her space at the upstage end of sofa . LINDA seats herself there , with her feet tucked under her and her back braced against the upstage arm of sofa . He takes a drink and grimaces at her. ) p. 41 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Must have been marvelous writing for the theatre when all you had to do was square the triangle ! ( It strikes him this is a mot ! He looks at her ) That 's not bad ! LINDA EASTERBROOK What 's good about it ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK It 's a gag on squaring the circle  --  ancient mathematical warhorse . LINDA EASTERBROOK What does it mean  --  squaring the circle ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Seeking to explain ) Well  --  ( Gives it up ) I have n't the faintest idea .

( Looks at him ) You 're not bad . I 've thought you were beautiful . ( Ruffles his hair . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Darling ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Darling ! ( They look at each other . She kisses him on his forehead . He takes her hand in his . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Darling ! ( They kiss again , this time on the lips and in a close embrace . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Darling !

He brushes the back of his hand across his lips @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holds his head in his hands for a few moments , then impulsively moves toward LINDA and buries his head against her breast . After a few moments ) God , dearest , I 'm blue . I 'm low . I 'm sunk . ( Places his head against her upstage shoulder and puts his arm about her R. shoulder ) I 'm so bored with myself . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Lightly ) Perhaps that just means you 're bored with me , huh ? p. 43 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( lifts his head to look at her ) You darling  --  you 're beautiful  --  ( Caresses her face with his L. hand ) You 're wonderful  --  ( Lowers his head to her shoulder . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Nevertheless  --  !

LINDA EASTERBROOK You were married . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh  --  ! ( He smiles ) Well , that was just an adolescent miscalculation . LINDA EASTERBROOK Perhaps this is a miscalculation of your maturity  --  p. 44 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I get lonely for you walking in the street . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( A slight hesitation ) I 've made a dinner date . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Another moment ) Oh  --  have you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I had no way of knowing whether you were coming home or not  --  I did n't feel in the mood of eating alone . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Who with ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Pym Lovell . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Sits up abruptly and swings his feet to the floor ) My God ! LINDA EASTERBROOK I like Pym . He 's a nice boy . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK When you first meet Pym Lovell you think what a precocious boy until you meet his father , then you realize it 's his father who 's precocious . Why do n't you have dinner with his father @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Because his father 's in London . Dine with us . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No , thanks . I 'll stick around here . LINDA EASTERBROOK I 'd cancel it , only he 's broken a date for me. p. 45 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Rises ) I 'll stay in and gather my thoughts .

GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( In utter misery ) Oh , for God 's sake @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Well , a little less all-seeing , a little less allwise , a little less clairvoyant . ( Goes above desk to C. , between chair and L. lounge. ) p. 47 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Calmly ) I am right then in assuming we 're washed up . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Coldly ) Sometimes by prophesying you make the undesirable come true . LINDA EASTERBROOK Not quite . No  --  I should want a little help from the outside .

Stick to it ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Furious at accepting help form the enemy , nevertheless accepting it ) Well , may I tell you that my concern is not abrupt at all  --  not in the least abrupt . I 've had it for some time  --  though you would n't suspect it from watching the  --  vehicles  --  I 've manufactured so glibly for you to ride to success in . ( Pauses a moment , then slaps his knee with his hand ) It 's arrogant of you to take it for granted that since you are too complacent to be tortured by this concern that such complacence must be universal ! ( Jumps up and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ anything profoundly irritating it 's the assumption that every general indignation may be traced to a private grievance .

Later that evening . The walls of the room are covered with velour in a soft green shade . In the back wall are three windows reaching from the floor to the ornamental border at the ceiling . These windows are entirely covered with green satin drapes , bordered with heavy gold strips . Inside the green curtains is a narrow gold curtain . At top of each window is an ornamental valance . Between the Left window and the Center window is a Spanish-type writing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is a large lamp , with metal base . A large green satin lamp shade covers the lamp . On the Right end of the table is a gold dial telephone and base . On the table also , an ash tray , a cigarette box , a match box and a copy of Vogue magazine . On the wall over the table is a large-size framed Chinese print . A large-size set of double doors are located in the Left wall opening off stage . Two steps lead up to this door . When the upstage side of the door is open , the foyer is seen without . Upstage of the double door , against the Left wall , is a mahogany wall table . On this table is a tall glass vase of Calla lilies . On the downstage side of the Right wall is located a door leading into the library . This door opens offstage . When the door is opened , a large bookcase filled with books , may be seen within library . Upstage of this door , against the wall , is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . On the top of cabinet are two metal urns filled with green leaves . Between the urns is a Buddha head mounted on a black pedestal . Downstage Right Center and on even line with Right door is a sofa , covered in a soft gray-green satin . This sofa is raked on slight angle with the Left end upstage . At the Right end of sofa is a low table , with a small silver tray containing two brandy glasses and a glass decanter of brandy . At the Left end of the sofa , is a double-decker table . On the top of this table is placed the small piece of remote control apparatus for the Capehart machine , supposedly installed in the wall cabinet against Right wall . Also , a push-button supposedly connecting with the Butler 's quarters , a glass ashtray , and a small glass bowl of flowers . Directly Center and on even line with upstage end of sofa is placed a good-sized stool , uphoistered in gray velour with small green tasseled fringes . On this stool is a piece of embroidery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at the beginning of the Scene . Upstage Left Center is set the backgammon table . The backgammon set is sunk into the top of this table . On the backgammon board the counters are arranged for playing . There are two leather dice cups , with pairs of dice therein . On the Right side of the table is a small glass ashtray and a small cigarette box , with a box of matches and cigarettes inside . On the Left side of the table is a small , round , glass-covered toy , with several tiny metal pellets inside , to be delicately maneuvered into strategic holes in the toy . On the Right side of table is a side chair , another one above the table . On the Left side , an armchair . These chairs match in upholstering . Below the table , a foot or so away from it , is a smaller stool . On the downstage side of the double doors , against the bottom step , is another side chair , matching those at the table . A large screen , decorated @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ On the upstage sides of Right and Left walls are candelabra wall brackets . Over the door Right is a decorative plaster figure . There is a wall table in the foyer outside the double door Left , also a wall bracket on the wall above the table . The brackets are all lighted , as is the table lamp . The room is softly and intimately lighted to suggest LINDA 'S later reference to it as a " dimly-lit oasis . " At the present time , the library door , Right , is closed ; the upstage door of double doors Left is open . AT RISE : As the Curtain rises , ROBERT , a tall , blond , impeccable butler , is standing below the R. end of sofa . He holds a small tray in his hands , with brandy glasses and decanter on it . He is serving GAY , who sits on the R. end of the sofa . AMANDA sits on the stool C. , sewing on a bit of embroidery . GAY is relaxed ; the food and the quiet and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have had the effect of smoothing out his smouldering irritations . GAY accepts the brandy glass from the tray , ROBERT puts the tray down on the low table at R. end of sofa , and goes out L. , closing door behind him . During this rite GAY and AMANDA are both silent AMANDA is wearing an exquisite housedress  --  she looks ravishing . She is quiet , slim and dark ; she has what is known as a classic profile of which she is aware and which she displays unobtrusively without ever a flourish . Her voice is gentle , low , musical  --  she seldom raises it  --  it is a rich voice rather , it vibrates with understanding and intimation . She lets it vibrate  --  she uses it  --  privately she tells herself that it has a cello quality . She has never confessed to anyone her private opinion of her voice . She is surprised , though , that no one has ever remarked it ; this unattention she attributes to the fact that most people are unmusical . She herself is intensely musical . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ composition , every soloist , every conductor . The cello finally produces a lovely tone . AMANDA SMITH ( Leans toward him ) Would you like to hear some music ? p. 53 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes . AMANDA SMITH What ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK The slow movement of something . AMANDA SMITH So should I. Of what ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( With shame ) I do n't know one composition from another . AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and moves to table L. end of sofa ) That 's not true . As a matter of fact you are very musical . ( She presses a button on the remotecontrol apparatus , set on the table , for the Capehart cunningly concealed in cabinet . The Capehart obliges with the Schubert Trio . AMANDA goes soundlessly back to the stool  --  a moving , lovely statuette . GAY extends himself a bit further on the over-stuffed sofa , drinking in the music and the aroma of the excellent brandy . Schubert fills the room . There is a silence while this pleasant absorption goes on . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Who wrote that ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Do you suppose he sweated over it ? AMANDA SMITH ( Reseats herself on stool ) I imagine not . Music poured out of him . He died at thirty-one and left over six hundred works . p. 54 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Lucky boy  --  on both counts ! He left something fabulous in the way of an estate , did n't he ? A few towels and some bed linen . Read that in the program notes at the Philharmonic . That 's where I get my musical culture . Wonder if Schubert could have gotten a job in Hollywood . ( He sips brandy ) This is wonderful brandy , Amanda . ( She stops her sewing but says nothing  --  a moment 's pause  --  Gay takes in the room ) Harmony  --  that 's your strong point , is n't it ?  --  Not a discordant note anywhere  --  all you have to do is sit here , digesting a perfect dinner , absorbing beautiful music through your ears , the bouquet of old brandy through your nostrils , harmony through every pore  --  in fact  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . AMANDA SMITH ( In a soft , low voice with no reproach in it ) You think me a spoiled rich woman . ( Rises  --  goes to table L. end of sofa  --  places sewing on shelf of table ) In your heart you despise me . ( Glances about the room ) Yes , it 's true I 've built an escape for myself here . ( Turns to GAY ) But I do n't want you to yield to it . Your rebellion against it , your indignation against it and against me  --  are what , in an odd way , I want to foster . The curious thing is  --  p. 55 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What ? AMANDA SMITH This indignation , this bitterness are what I miss in your plays . ( Sits on L. arm of sofa ) How is it they do n't get into your plays ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Perhaps my plays are my ivory-tower , my escape . AMANDA SMITH They should n't be . They should express your struggle  --  not your escape from the struggle . You live in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reflect it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK If my plays are trivial perhaps it 's because I am . AMANDA SMITH That 's not true . I deny that  --  passionately . ( Laughs . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Perhaps one expresses oneself in spite of oneself  --  one 's unconscious forces one to . ( Pauses to think this over ) One must have read that somewhere . AMANDA SMITH You 're so impressionable , Gay . Everything effects you . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK When you hear a yearner say he has wonderful ideas if he could only express them , he 's a liar . He 's kidding himself . He has no ideas to express . p. 56 AMANDA SMITH ( Rises ; moves to below L. end of sofa ) Expression should be not yourself but an extension of yourself . Not what you are but what you might be . ( Sits on L. end of sofa . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Skeptically ) Living above your means artistically  --  inflation  --  ( Laughs ) inflation in the esthetic realm  --  disastrous as it is in the economic  --  or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mandy , how little one knows first hand  --  how much we have to take on faith from what other people tell us . How seldom we get down to First Principles . Wish I had a First Principle . Have n't got one  --  not one measly First Principle . AMANDA SMITH Do n't wander ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Love to wander . AMANDA SMITH ( Leans toward him ; takes his hand in hers ) The truth is  --  you coddle yourself . You 're lazy . And you permit yourself to be diverted by  --  circumstances . ( Leans back away from him . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What circumstances ? ( A pause . She wo n't tell . GAY sips his brandy , then looks at her and insists ) What circumstances ? p. 57 AMANDA SMITH Shall I tell you ? Do you really want to hear ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No . AMANDA SMITH ( With a little laugh ) I thought you did n't . ( He knows what she means  --  he lets it go for the moment . A pause . In these intervals @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ becomes audible . She draws her hand from his and leans forward ) How else can you achieve anything except by going , beyond what you can hope ? That 's the whole realm of the imagination , is n't it  --  extension ! Inflation exactly . That 's what art is . Extension of credit . Overextension . Ad infinitum . ( Leans back again . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( To get to more immediate ground ) What circumstances ? AMANDA SMITH You will misunderstand me . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Smiles ) What do you care ? AMANDA SMITH ( Bravely ) Well , then , the circumstance that you are married to a very successful actress of comedy and that you have written your plays not to express yourself but to express her . This is the first time really that you have broken away from  --  that circumstance in your work . ( After a moment ) Did you tell her , by the way ? p. 58 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns away from her ) No . AMANDA SMITH ( Teasingly , with a little laugh ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! AMANDA SMITH You 'll have to tell her , you know . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK She 's been waiting for six months for a play by me . I simply ca n't bear to tell her there 's no part for her in my new one . AMANDA SMITH Does n't she ask what you are doing ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes . Of course . AMANDA SMITH What do you say ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh , she 's used to me grousing  --  AMANDA SMITH ( After a moment ) You ought to tell her . So she can get something else for next season . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK She 's reading scripts all the time . Has n't found anything . I feel curiously  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Quickly ) It 's not your fault  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Nevertheless I feel  --  curiously  --  ( Sips his brandy. ) p. 59 AMANDA SMITH You did n't set out not to write a part for her . You set out to do a serious play . That there will be no part in it for her is sad . It is also @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ table R. end of sofa , then rises and goes below sofa to above stool C. ) I must sound horrid . ( A pause . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) You do like the first act , do n't you ? AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to him ) It 's superb . You know it is . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I do n't . ( He moves over to R. side of backgammon table and puts his cigrette into ashtray . ) AMANDA SMITH You were in such wonderful spirits when you came in this afternoon  --  so exhilarated  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) Since then  --  I 've had a terrible sinking of the heart  --  about the second act . ( Sits on stool below table ) Mandy  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Prepared to sympathize and undergo creative spasms ) What , dear ? ( Rises. ) p. 60 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Shut off that damn music . AMANDA SMITH Yes , dear . ( Tranquilly , unhurried , she moves to the little apparatus on the table and shuts off the music . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all I 've got here is a one-act idea  --  one of those trick things that 's insoluble once you spring it  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Goes to behind chair R. side of table L. Firmly  --  standing by ) I do n't believe it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Barrie had an idea like that once  --  a dilemma that could n't be resolved . AMANDA SMITH That would n't be a bad title for the play  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What ? AMANDA SMITH Dilemma . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes , Not bad . AMANDA SMITH Do you like it really ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes  --  it 's all right . ( Looks away from her ) Now all I need is the play . AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down to above and R. of him ) Do n't be discouraged . I wo n't let you give this up . I know  --  I feel  --  that this departure is a turningpoint for you  --  significant for all your future work  --  beyond what you realize . p. 61 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Curtain of the first act is good , is n't it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ few steps ) It 's breath-taking . The suspense of it is really thrilling . ( Turns and looks at him ) Will he go into that room or wo n't he ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks up at her ) What 'll be do , though , after he gets into the room ? After the father sees him ? ( Rises and goes below stool over to below R. end of sofa ) No  --  it 's impossible  --  it 's a false alarm  --  it 's one of those flashy ideas that sounds marvelous . AMANDA SMITH ( Follows behind him ) I do n't believe it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( In utter despair ) I 'm washed up , Mandy ! ( She tries to placate him ) It 's no good . It 's lousy . The Hell with it . AMANDA SMITH ( Takes his arm , turns and leads him to sofa ) Now just sit down quietly and have another brandy  --  and be calm  --  ( GAY sits moodily on the L. end of sofa , facing his doom as a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of the sofa and picks up the decanter of brandy , pulls out the stopper and picks up his glass ) Look at your idea as a whole  --  think of your idea as a whole  --  ( He says nothing . He is beyond hope . Suddenly she goes on ) A distinguished scientist whose reputation is unimpeachable  --  Nobel prize winner in chemistry and all that sort of thing  --  has an only son  --  ( Pours the brandy into glass ) who goes to fight for the Loyalists in the Spanish war . The boy is killed . He is blown to bits by a German bomb at Guernica . ( Replaces stopper in decanter ; puts decanter down on tray ) The father finds this fact unbearable . He can not reconcile himself to it that his beautiful boy  --  a poet , generous , gifted and sensitive  --  ( Goes below sofa to R.of him  --  hands glass to him ) should be scattered , unrecognizably mangled , in a Spanish suburb  --  ( Gay sits modily listening  --  his brain is settling into a groove @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  she observes this. ) p. 62 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Inaudibly ) Thank you , darling  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Turns , goes to R. end of the sofa and sits . Her beautiful voice goes on , hypnotically ) Well , he goes on with his work , clings to his work , spends days and nights in his laboratory . One night he falls asleep  --  and his son appears to him , his son speaks to him . He wakes , thinking it a dream , but the communication continues . He begins to investigate psychic phenomena and he becomes convinced that communication with the dead is possible . He is convinced by the messages he receives from his son . he publishes these communications . So that this renowned scientist , this arch-skeptic , becomes himself a conver to mysticism . Because of his scientific eminence this conversion becomes an international sensation , all over the world , the griefstricken flock to him for comfort  --  just as , in another time , people followed Christ . ( Rises , moves below sofa and c. stool over @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sits , listening , broading . He swallows another drink . Her cello voice plays on ) Gradually he is forced to give up his scientific work altogether , he addresses gigantic meetings  --  Into one of these meetings in the Albert Hall in London a young man wonders . ( Turns to GAY ) He listens . Suddenly an area clears in his befuddled brain . He remembers . The greybearded man on the platform is his father . ( Moves over to L. end of sofa ) His past history begins to take form . He remembers where he lived before he enlisted  --  he makes his way to his father 's house . He goes inside . Asks the old servant to see his father She does n't recognize him , believing him to be dead . ( Goes to R.side of c. stool ) The father has not yet returned from the lecture . So she asks him to wait , He sits there waiting ( Sits on the C. stool ) when suddenly a horrid misgiving strikes his mind . Words spoken by his father in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in on him that his father has a new career , that he is delivering a message to the world and that this message is based on a single fact  --  his own death . Will his father want to see him ? Dare he be alive ? He looks out of the window and sees the bent old man , his father  --  his face lined with grief and lit by faith , being helped from his car . Shall he face him ? Shall he go away ? He hesitates  --  his hand on the latch of the door  --  Curtain ! ( A pause . GAY sits absorbed and quiet , sips his brandy , then bends forward . AMANDA leans forward , looks at him intently , then begins to smile as she sees another expression come over his face. ) p. 63 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Strained and tense voice ) Mandy  --  AMANDA SMITH Yes , Gay . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I 've got it ! AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and moves a few steps toward him . Beside herself ) Gay  --  Gay darling ! GAYLORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 've got the second act , Mandy  --  you adorable , wonderful creature  --  I 've got it . I 've been struggling for days with this  --  for weeks  --  and you 've given it to me ! AMANDA SMITH Oh , nonsense ! I only repeated your own idea  --  what you brought to me . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK There 's something about you , some magic  --  AMANDA SMITH What is it ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( A little surprised ) What ? AMANDA SMITH The idea . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh ! It 's this  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Turns upstage to L.end of sofa ) I 'm so excited I can hardly bear it ! p. 64 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns and moves R. a few steps ) I hope it 'll still be good ! AMANDA SMITH ( Laughs ) Of course it 's good . I know it 's good . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes to table R.end of sofa and picks up the decanter ) Darling , I 've got to have some more  --  ? AMANDA SMITH Yes  --  of course . Have as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into his glass ) If this is really good I 'm saved ! ( Turns and moves below sofa to L. side of backgammon table ) You can see what a Hell of a spot I was in with that curtain  --  the dilemma was not only the hero 's but my own  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to him ) I know . ( AMANDA moves to behind chair R.of table . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK But now I see it  --  I think I see it . ( Sits chair L. of table ) The boy does n't leave the house . He waits . ( She sits chair R.side of table ) The fact that his old nurse has n't recognized him gives him an idea  --  he looks at the photograph of himself on the table  --  then he looks in the mirror . He laughs at the idea that he thought anybody might recognize him . His face is all patched up  --  half of it shot away  --  he is really a testimonial of the progress of plastic surgery . ( He rises and moves down @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ father comes in  --  he tells him that he is a friend of his dead son 's  --  he carries a letter from him  --  the father sends the old woman to fetch the boy 's mother and sister  --  ( Turns and moves below table to C. ) the boy takes out a piece of paper from his pocket  --  This is a poem he had written on his last day  --  a poem on Spain  --  p. 65 AMANDA SMITH Oh , Gay , it 's too  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK When his mother and sister come in he gives them this poem  --  this is a message from their son to them , which he had asked him to deliver to them if he survived  --  They read the poem  --  they weep  --  the boy watches them with a strange kind of amusement  --  he realizes too that his voice also is another voice  --  he realizes that he is , in fact , a ghost  --  ( Moves over to R. of her ) He realized too that if his father did recognize him it would be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life now is centered on this new illusion he has created  --  this method of communication with the dead  --  ( Grasps her hand in his ) this proof of immortality  --  AMANDA SMITH They none of them know him ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK They none of them know him ! He takes tea and talks to them about their darling  --  describes what he did and said and felt in his last days . ( Draws his hand away ) The father goes to his desk and with complete sincerity shows him messages he has received from the dead boy  --  messages now confirmed by the miraculous testimony of this God-sent eye-witness  --  p. 66 AMANDA SMITH It 's wonderful  --  Gay darling  --  It 's wonderful  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes above table to L. of it  --  feverishly excited ) And then listen  --  he stays there , goes among them , lives among them  --  a ghost secure in his nonentity , made increasingly aware that he himself is not wnated  --  ( Sits chair L. of table ) with one exception  --  AMANDA SMITH Who ? GAYLORD @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was going to marry when he left . She recognizes him . Something gives it away to her . Some trick or phrase  --  something  --  I do n't know  --  I 'll have to make it up  --  something between them that she knows unmistakably belongs to them alone  --  and she 's  --  it all just comes to me as I go along  --  she 's fallen in love with another man  --  she 's going to marry another man  --  but she recognizes him , she knows  --  and that scene , that moment of recognition when she finds out and the audience knows she 's found out  --  that 's my curtain for the second act . ( Looks anxiously at her , awaiting her reaction . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Holds out her hands on table toward him ) It 's wonderful ! p. 67 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I think it 's good  --  I think it 'll hold ! What do you think ? AMANDA SMITH It 's marvelous ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Places both his hands on hers ) It 'll give me a third @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a third  --  AMANDA SMITH I know it will . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh , Mandy , I love you ! ( She laughs a little skeptically , ruefully and pulls her hands away ) Oh , darling  --  I do love you ! You 're so good for me ! You 're wonderful for me ! I 'd never have gotten this idea if not for you . AMANDA SMITH ( Rises ) Nonsense . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Rises ) It 's you started me on this . I 'd never have tried it at all if not for you . ( Moves around below her to R. of her and embraces her ) Darling ! I love you ! ( Kisses her ) I 'm so grateful to you . AMANDA SMITH Well , that 's something quite different . ( Draws out of his arms and backs away to behind chair L. of table ) And there 's no reason for it . This is all I have  --  to help you to express yourself  --  I 've always felt such profound things in you  --  unrealized potentialities  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EASTERBROOK ( Holds out his hand and moves toward her ) Mandy darling  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down , takes his hand  --  leads him toward library door R. ) While you 're high on it  --  why do n't you put it down ? Go into the library and put it down before you forget it . ( The TELEPHONE rings . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK All right . AMANDA SMITH Oh , I 'm sorry . ( Stops , turns and goes up toward telephone ) Excuse me , darling  --  I 've got to answer that . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes to the library door and opens it ) Where 's the light ? AMANDA SMITH They 're on the right  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Finds the switch and turns on the light in the library . Then he turns in the door and looks at her ) Angel  --  ! AMANDA SMITH Now go to work  --  ( GAY goes into the room ; leaves door open . AMANDA answers the telephone . Her voice on the phone is soft , low and modulated ) Yes  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ !  --  Where are you ?  --  Oh , are you ? I 'd love to  --  I 'd be delighted to  --  tell her I 'll be only  --  come over rigth away  --  Goodbye . ( Hangs up , then moves down to upper R. side of table. ) p. 69 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( In library off R. ) Who was that ? AMANDA SMITH An old beau of mine  --  Pym Lovell . ( A pause as GAY re-enters to below R. end of sofa . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Did you say Lovell ! AMANDA SMITH ( Moves up to behind chair R. of table ) And your wife ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( In a burst of fury ) She knew I was here ! AMANDA SMITH Then you did tell her ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Never mentioned you . She 's spying on me ! AMANDA SMITH Do you want to leave ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Well  --  what for ? AMANDA SMITH Sometimes I think you 're afraid of Linda . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes over to L. side of backgammon table ) Oh , you do ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I did n't tell her about you ! But if she chooses to track me down , spy on me , get a stooge like Makepeace Lovell to call you up when she knows I 'm here  --  ( Returns to below R. side of stool below table. ) p. 70 AMANDA SMITH ( Moves to R. of C. stool . Breaks in ) How does she know you 're here ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK She guesses . There 's nothing she does n't guess . It 's like living with a medium . AMANDA SMITH It 's too bad this had to happen just now  --  when you were so excited about your idea . ( Goes toward door R. ) You could go into the library and work  --  ( Stops below sofa and turns to GAY ) and she need never know you 're here at all . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Sulkily ) No , thanks ! I do n't mind hiding in a bedroom but hiding in a library seems kind of dry . ( Goes upstage  --  L. side of table  --  to above it . AMANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stopper in decanter . Fuming still ) The thing about Linda I can stand least is the unconscious censorship she exercise over me ! AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to him ) How ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Picks up his glass from the table ) Something damnable in our relationship which makes it impossible for me to be unfaithful to her . ( Drinks. ) p. 71 AMANDA SMITH ( Moves over to B. side of C. stool ) You 're in love with her . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Puts glass down on table ) What does that mean ? AMANDA SMITH You must be . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK It may be that in my first marriage  --  ( Moves down to L. side of stool below the table ) whatever you may say  --  how did you find it ? AMANDA SMITH What ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Your first marriage . Did you cheat ? I did . And it does  --  whatever you may say  --  it does something to the fabric of a marriage  --  rots it  --  destroys it . Does that sound Victorian ? Well , why the Hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Goes a few steps down L. ) AMANDA SMITH ( Bravely ) You 're in love with her . I 've felt that . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) It 's got nothing to do with love ! I resent Linda .

( Turns and moves over L. to door steps. ) p. 72 AMANDA SMITH Is that your experience with me ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) With you , Mandy  --  ? ( Moves a few steps to below table ) Why , for God 's sake , Mandy . Our relation has a  --  different basis  --  from that  --  a sounder basis . AMANDA SMITH ( Goes below stool to R. of him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ moment ) Yes  --  ( Takes her hands in his ) What a miserable ambush sex is ! If you read the early war poets  --  you 'll discover that they went to war as to a lustral purge . They wanted to get away from the trivialities of sex to something higher , ( Turns and goes to chair down L. ) more ennobling , heroic  --  well , they went from one ambush to another . ( Sits on the chair ) The scientists are the lucky ones . AMANDA SMITH ( Moves to above stool below table L. ) You think so ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes !  --  Absorbed in the passion for truth . AMANDA SMITH Not exclusively . p. 73 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( With a sharp look at her ) No ? AMANDA SMITH I 've known at least one distinguished scientist . He invited me to his laboratory and attacked me among the test-tubes . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Not without jealousy ) Well , you invite that sort of thing . AMANDA SMITH ( Demurely ) Do I ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK You know damn well @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ so subtle  --  that it 's inaudible  --  ( Turns and goes over to table L. end of sofa and arranges flowers in vase ) at least to you . ( Laughs . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) Mandy  --  I 've got to make Linda divorce me . AMANDA SMITH Oh  --  ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK She spoils my fun ! AMANDA SMITH ( Moves over to above C. stool . Laughs her soft , purring laugh ) You 're intensely respectable , Gay . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Rises  --  goes up to L. of her  --  in bitter selfhatred ) Of course I am ! I 'm a wretched Puritan ! ( Philo comes in L. He enters room to below stool by table . He did n't know AMANDA was to be home . He has been told she was dining out . He acts like a stranger , as if the house did n't belong to him . AMANDA and GAY turn toward him. ) p. 74 PHILO SMITH Oh ! I  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Easily ) You know Mr. Easterbrook ? PHILO SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Abruptly ) How are you ? PHILO SMITH ( Nods , murmurs inarticulate greeting ) Excuse me . ( Goes R. below them toward library door , taking his eyeglasses from his pocket case . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns toward PHILO . Loudly ) What for ? PHILO SMITH ( Stops below L. end of sofa  --  turns to GAY ) I just  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Quickly ) Early for you , Phil . We dined in . PHILO SMITH ( Puts on his glasses  --  very abstracted ) Yes . ( Turns and starts again for library door . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( To lighten things up ) I was just about to go into your library  --  ( PHILO stops below L. end of sofa  --  turns to GAY ) to add to its collection ! p. 75 PHILO SMITH Oh ? ( Turns and starts for door again . ) AMANDA SMITH Gay 's just had a thrilling idea for his new play . PHILO SMITH ( Stops on threshold of door ) Oh  --  well , may I just  --  I need a few reference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ) Excuse me ? ( Goes out through library door , closing it . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moves to L. of her and takes her hands in his . After a moment ) You married a monosyllable . ( Goes below her to below the sofa . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Moves to above R. side of stool ) Philo is a very clever man . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Will he stay in the library long ? AMANDA SMITH No , he 'll just get some books and go up to his room . He 's writing something , I believe . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) Really ? What ? AMANDA SMITH I do n't know . I 've never asked him and he 's never told me . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks toward library door ) Most of the books in his library are locked behind steel grilles. p. 76 AMANDA SMITH It 's a very famous collection , I believe . ( Sits on C. stool . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at her ) Buying first editions and collecting pictures gives rich men a sense @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ act of purchase  --  ( Looks at library door ) they 've written the books and painted the pictures . AMANDA SMITH Philo 's not like that . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No ? ( Turns and goes to R. of her ) What sort of a name is that Philo ? How could you marry a fellow named Philo ? AMANDA SMITH I thought I could help him . He had one moment of weakness which he has never forgiven himself for revealing to me . He has never forgiven me either . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at the door  --  then bends over to her , confidentially ) What was it ? AMANDA SMITH You want to know everything , do n't you ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes . I do . AMANDA SMITH Well , permit me some mystery . p. 77 PHILO SMITH ( Re-enters , closing door , carrying armful of books . He starts across the room toward door L. with his burden ) Excuse me  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns toward PHILO . Indicating books ) Are those from behind the grilles ? PHILO SMITH ( Stops @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your pardon  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moves downstage a few steps ) Most of the books in your library are locked behind steel grilles . Firsts , I suppose ? PHILO SMITH A good many . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Really ? PHILO SMITH Yes . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I personally ca n't understand this passion for first editions . I 'd just as soon read a book in the Modern Library . When you have to lock a book behind a grille like a teller in a bank there seems something strained about it . PHILO SMITH Some are unique texts . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Then they should be in a museum . PHILO SMITH They will be . They are only waiting , as is customary with the relatives of rich men , for me to die . ( Looks sharply at AMANDA , then turns and starts for door L. ) ( AMANDA stabs him a look  --  she hates him . GAY looks at him anew also ; feels suddenly a curdled respect for him but increased antagonism. ) p. 78 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Mandy tells me you write . PHILO SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Not exactly . ( Moves R. a few steps ) I compile . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Ah ! Research must be fascinating . It gives one a sense of creation without the agony . PHILO SMITH ( In his edged voice ) There is something in what you say . I hope you are not one of those authors who gets a sense of creation merely because they agonize . At any rate my library is at your service now for either process  --  I trust for both . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns and moves R. a few steps ) Thank you very much . ( Stops by door ; turns to PHILO ) I 've never worked in a vault before . I may be outside the grilles now but one day I 'll be behind them . Oh , God ! ( Goes out through library door R. , closing it . ) ( A moment 's silence between PHILO and AMANDA . ) PHILO SMITH For a fashionable writer your friend 's repartees are rather lame . AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and goes to table L. end of sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not a fashionable writer . He 's much better than that . Besides  --  you would lame anybody . p. 79 PHILO SMITH ( Moves R. a few steps ) Must we , at this late , date , bother with personalities ? AMANDA SMITH ( Tragically ) I suppose riot . PHILO SMITH Why is he so combative ? Am I in his way ? Surely not . I even let him use my library ! AMANDA SMITH I find your humor disgusting ! PHILO SMITH You are over-sensitive . Good night . ( Turns to go . ) AMANDA SMITH Good night . PHILO SMITH ( Stops and turns to her ) Oh , the boys are coming home for the Easter vacation . Shall you be in town ? AMANDA SMITH ( Viciously ) Yes  --  I shall be here and I shall be nice to them . ( Rings bell again . ) PHILO SMITH ( Quite sincerely ) I appreciate what you do for them very much . ( Turns and starts for the door ) Good night , Amanda . AMANDA SMITH ( Obeying some @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enjoyed so much the other evening at the Wylers ' is coming . p. 80 PHILO SMITH ( Stops by bottom step and turns to AMANDA ) What lady ? AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down a few steps ) Gay 's wife . Surely you remember her . She talked a blue streak . You seemed to enjoy it . PHILO SMITH ( Moves R. a few steps ) The actress ? AMANDA SMITH Yes  --  on and off . PHILO SMITH Is she coming here ? AMANDA SMITH ( Goes below c. stool to R. of PHILO ) Why are you so surprised ? PHILO SMITH When is she coming ? AMANDA SMITH ( Jealous , not of PHILO but of LINDA ) You 'd like to see her ! I believe you would ! PHILO SMITH As I remember  --  she is extremely gracious . AMANDA SMITH Yes . That is her specialty . ( Goes to below the sofa  --  turns to him ) She 'll be here any minute . I 'm sure she 'll be glad to see you . Why do n't you wait up @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it inadvisable ) I think not . Thank you , Amanda . ( ROBERT enters L. , bows to PHILO , and stands on upstage side of bottom step ) I am very tired . Good night , Robert . ( Goes out , carrying the books under his arm and leaving the door open . ) ( For some reason AMANDA is pleased by her husband 's refusal to wait up for LINDA  --  it encourages her as proving that LINDA is not universally irresistible . It is for this reason that she takes the trouble , later , to make it clear to LINDA that PHILO did not take advantage of the opportunity to see her . She pauses  --  a general scrutinizing of the terrain , weighing possibilities . She is thinking shrewdly . ROBERT goes to below L. side of backgammon table. ) p. 81 AMANDA SMITH Robert , Mr. Lovell and Mrs. Easterbrook are coming . Mr. Easterbrook is in the library working and asked not to be disturbed on any account . ( Starts for door R. ) Let me know the moment they arrive @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stops at door and turns to ROBERT ) Oh , I shall be in the library . ROBERT ( Taking everything in precisely ) Yes , madame . ( Amanda goes out through the library door R. , closing it . ROBERT goes up to L. side of table , picks up GAY 'S glass , then starts for the table at L. end of the sofa to get the ashtray there , when the DOOR CHIMES rings off L. ROBERT stops C. , turns and goes out L. After a few moments VOICES are heard in the foyer . ROBERT reenters and stands front of chair downstage of the door . LINDA comes in , followed by MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( PYM ) . He is an attractive , wryly humorous young Englishman , wearing a dinner-jacket . He has a distinguished ancestry , a small income and does odd journalism . PYM has n't quite found himself  --  he hovers pleasantly on the brink of this discovery , feeling somehow it 'll be more fun not ever quite to find out . LINDA , for whatever reason , is in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ into a lovely evening frock . LINDA goes to below the stool by table . PYM closes the door and follows in to L. of her. ) p. 82 ROBERT ( To LINDA ) Mrs. Smith asked me to tell you that Mr. Easterbrook is in the library working  --  ( LINDA looks at ROBERT ) and was on no account to be disturbed . ( PYM looks sharply at LINDA . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Where 's Mrs. Smith ? ROBERT She is in the library . ( PYM quickly looks at ROBERT ) She wanted to know directly you came . LINDA EASTERBROOK Well  --  we 're here . ROBERT I 'll tell her . ( Goes across downstage toward the library door . ) ( Linda and PYM look at each other . ROBERT knocks lightly on the door , then opens it . LINDA and PYM both quickly look toward the open door . ROBERT enters library and closes door . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks at PYM ) Working ! ( Moves over to below sofa , looking at door ) Gay has n't worked in months @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what do you suppose they 're doing in the library ? LINDA EASTERBROOK This is bad , Pym  --  worse than you think  --  p. 83 MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Goes up to L. side  --  flips cigarette ashes into ashtray ) You know , Linda , I have distinctly the feeling that in maneuvering me here , you are using me , huh ? LINDA EASTERBROOK You 're psychic ! ( Turns and goes upstage to L. end of screen and peers behind it . ) MAKEPEACE LOVELL You were restless during dinner , though I have seldom been so entertaining . Several times you were slow on the up-take . That 's a bad sign . Then suddenly you had an impulse to go home and change into that dress . ( Moves down to stool below table ) And now I find myself here  --  a house which I have perfected a special technique for avoiding . ( Sits on stool ) If I 'd wanted to be bored I could have gone to the Russels ' . ( Looks at LINDA ) You just got me here to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull evening . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves down to R. of him ) Pym  --  leave me alone with Amanda . MAKEPEACE LOVELL Certainly not ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Pats him on the head ) Get an attack of something and say you have to go home . Please  --  darling , leave me alone with her . p. 84 MAKEPEACE LOVELL Oh , well , as I ca n't be alone with you I do n't mind in the least doing that . Shall I go back to your flat and wait for you ? I feel like baring my soul to Clementine . LINDA EASTERBROOK No , do n't go to my place  --  go to yours . MAKEPEACE LOVELL You hope to retrieve Gay , do n't you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . MAKEPEACE LOVELL And if you do n't retrieve him  --  ( Clasps her L. hand in his ) will you call me the moment you get back ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . MAKEPEACE LOVELL You promise ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I promise . Darling  --  MAKEPEACE LOVELL Right . ( She goes slowly above stool C. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way but then we Lovells are patient . An ancestor of mine waited half a century for a stubborn woman  --  married her at seventy and gave her three children . I am your Fate , Linda . It 's fellers like me who made the Empire  --  surely I should n't fail with you . LINDA EASTERBROOK Sometimes , Makepeace , your humor is meretricious. p. 85 MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Cross ) And do n't call me Makepeace . ( Pushes his stool up against the table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's your name . MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Leans back against table ) I know , but when you call me Makepeace my chances seem to  --  dwindle . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Returns to R. of him ) Why do n't you have an affair with Amanda ? She 'll see your latent possibilities . MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Loftily ) I am not a casual sensualist , Miss Paige . LINDA EASTERBROOK Oh , there 'll be nothing gross about it  --  it 'll all be on a high plane  --  very mystic . ( Amanda comes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ goes at once to LINDA . LINDA moves R. toward AMANDA . AMANDA is full of warmth and welcome . PYM rises and stands below stool . ) AMANDA SMITH Oh , how good of you to come ! ( They shake hands . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( L. of her ) How nice of you to have me ! p. 86 AMANDA SMITH ( Goes below C. stool over to PYM ) PYM darling , how are you ? ( Offers him her cheeks to kiss . He pecks at it . ) MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( L. of MANDY ) How are you , pet ? AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA ) Do sit down . ( LINDA sits on L. end of the sofa . PYM looks over AMANDA , then moves around below table to upper L. side of it ) I 've asked Gay often to bring you . ( She pulls the C. stool over closer to the sofa ) Has he never told you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK As a matter of fact , no  --  I do n't think he has . AMANDA SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ neglectful of him . But then  --  I do n't suppose we should expect ordinary punctiliousness from a genius . MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Puts out his cigarette in ashtray and looks at AMANDA ) Oh , why not ? AMANDA SMITH You 're not a genius , Pym dear , or you 'd know . ( PYM reacts . To LINDA ) Would n't he , Linda ? Oh , do you mind if I call you Linda ? I feel I know you so well  --  p. 87 LINDA EASTERBROOK Of course  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Moves around R. side of stool below it ) Call me Mandy . ( PYM picks up the toy on table and examines it ) We were sitting here quietly after dinner when Gay suddenly had an idea  --  ( LINDA reacts to this . PYM moves down to stool )  --  and nothing will do but he must rush into the library and set it down . ( Sits on the stool C. ) MAKEPEACE LOVELL Sounds very rude ! ( Sits on stool ; becomes engrossed in toy . ) AMANDA SMITH @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ does n't understand , does he ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Not in the least ! MAKEPEACE LOVELL Well , if everybody jumped up and rushed into seclusion whenever any sort of idea struck them what would become of social life ? You could n't possibly give a dinner party , could you ? AMANDA SMITH Fortunately , I suppose , very few people get ideas . MAKEPEACE LOVELL Oh , nonsense ! Nothing is so common . I get ideas all the time . Only I file them decently away in my mind till I 'm alone , at which time I discard them . ( Leans forward toward her ) That 's conventional digestion . ( They exchange looks . AMANDA laughs politely but does n't like this vein much . PYM chuckles. ) p. 88 AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA ) My husband was here . He did so enjoy your society the other night at the Wylers ' . I told him you were coming and asked him to wait up to see you but , unfortunately , he is a creature of routine . He went to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she is relieved . She sighs . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I 'm sorry . I should like to have seen him again .  --  Our last meeting was so  --  provocative ! AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and moves up a few steps toward table with bell on it ) Shall I get him ? He may be still up . LINDA EASTERBROOK Oh , no  --  please not . MAKEPEACE LOVELL You can do me a favor , Mandy . AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to him ) What , Pym dear ? MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Still playing with the toy ) My editor in London has asked me to get a symposium of opinion over here . Your husband 's name is on my list . ( Looks at her ) Can you fix it for me ? AMANDA SMITH It 's not so easy . Philo hates publicity . But I might get him to stretch a point in your case . ( PYM nods his thanks . AMANDA sits on stool . To Linda ) Though I do n't know why I should do anything for him  --  ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he neglect you ? p. 89 LINDA EASTERBROOK He 's spasmodic . Either he rushes me  --  or ignores me . AMANDA SMITH He 's quite uniform with me . ( Glances at PYM . ) MAKEPEACE LOVELL Well , if you do fix this interview with your husband for me , Mandy , I 'll take you to lunch  --  a week from Wednesday . AMANDA SMITH Done and done . MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Still looking at toy ) The reward is excessive but then I hate haggling . ( He glances briefly at AMANDA . AMANDA looks at PYM and smiles uncertainly . LINDA signals him with her hand . He catches her eye ) What  --  ? ( Looks at AMANDA ) Oh ! ( Rises and goes to L. of AMANDA ) And now I shall leave you two adorable cretures together to scratch each other 's eyes out . AMANDA SMITH You 're not going ! MAKEPEACE LOVELL I am indeed ! ( Takes hold of her L. hand . ) AMANDA SMITH But why  --  - you 've just come ! MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Striking his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've just been struck by an idea . I 've got to go somewhere private  --  ( Looks toward door L. ) to put it down . You see , Mandy , I am a genius . p. 90 AMANDA SMITH Really , Pym ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Besides  --  I asked him not to stay . Good night , Pym . MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Goes above AMANDA to L. end of sofa ) Good night , Linda . ( Bends over and kisses her hand solemnly , then turns to AMANDA ) good night , Mandy . ( Kisses the top of her head solemnly . ) AMANDA SMITH Good night , ( He goes above her a few steps L. ) you funny boy ! MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Stops and turns and looks at them BOTH appraisingly ) You know , I would give thirty guineas to overhear your conversation . ( Looks at AMANDA ) I shall pray for you , Mandy  --  ( Starts again for the door ) to be victorious . AMANDA SMITH ( Looks at LINDA ) What is he chattering about ? LINDA EASTERBROOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ EASTERBROOK Wonderful ! MAKEPEACE LOVELL ( Stops on top step at upstage side of door ) In any event , I shall marry the survivor . And if you both die in combat I shall retire to a nunnery . ( Goes out , closing the door. ) p. 91 LINDA EASTERBROOK I adore Pym , do n't you ? AMANDA SMITH ( Looks at LINDA ) Yes . I 'm very fond of him . ( Turns and glares at door through which Pym has gone ) Rather wastes himself , though , does n't he ? ( Looks at LINDA . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK That 's not necessarily extravagant ! AMANDA SMITH Oh  --  ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I mean  --  if people want to waste themselves , why should n't they ? AMANDA SMITH I 'm afraid I do n't agree  --  that goes against my profoundest convictions  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Does it ? AMANDA SMITH Yes . I believe that people have an obligation  --  it may sound priggish to say so  --  but a profound moral obligation to live up to the best in them . LINDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ AMANDA SMITH Obviously they do n't . LINDA EASTERBROOK Can one add a cubit to one 's stature ? AMANDA SMITH People do it all the time . Great occasions make them , crises make them , love makes them . One must unearth one 's latent powers  --  develop them . p. 92 LINDA EASTERBROOK How nice to believe in these psychic trapdoors ! AMANDA SMITH You put it very well . LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's all so comforting ! AMANDA SMITH History is full of people who have exceeded their capacities . LINDA EASTERBROOK No  --  perhaps they have merely expressed them . ( A moment , then : ) AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and goes to table L. ) We disagree . We disagree  --  ( Picks up cigarette box , turns to LINDA ) fundamentally . ( Smiles ) Is n't that delightful ? ( Offers open box to LINDA . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Great fun ! ( She shakes her head negatively at offer of cigarette . A pause . She glances at the library door ) I gather  --  that Gay is in your library @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  what he . is working on ? AMANDA SMITH ( Lights a cigarette for herself . Innocently , permitting herself the assumption that LINDA knows ) His new play . ( Turns to table ; places match in ashtray. ) p. 93 LINDA EASTERBROOK Really ? I did n't know he had a new play  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Turns and moves to L. of C. stool ) Really ? Oh , I 'm terribly sorry . I  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) It 's quite all right . I 'm delighted naturally . Do you know what it 's about ? AMANDA SMITH ( Solemnly ) It 's about immortality . LINDA EASTERBROOK Really ? AMANDA SMITH Yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK What on earth does Gay know about immortality ? AMANDA SMITH What does anyone know about immortality ?  --  except by intuition . LINDA EASTERBROOK But Gay  --  you do know his other work ? AMANDA SMITH But this is altogether different from his other work  --  profounder  --  richer ! I think it 's great . I think you 'll be proud . LINDA EASTERBROOK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ me about it , do you suppose ? AMANDA SMITH Because  --  p. 94 LINDA EASTERBROOK Why ? AMANDA SMITH No . ( Looks away ) I must n't say it . LINDA EASTERBROOK Oh , but you must . Please  --  Mandy . AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA ) I 'm afraid you 'll misunderstand my motive . LINDA EASTERBROOK But I assure you I wo n't . I 'll understand it perfectly . AMANDA SMITH ( Facing her bravely ) Because  --  there 's no part in it for you . LINDA EASTERBROOK But that 's so silly . I love playing in Gay 's plays ; I love speaking his lines . But if he 's written a play and it 's good I shall be very happy . Surely he knows that and that I know it . AMANDA SMITH ( Moves a step toward LINDA ) Perhaps he thought that  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK What ? AMANDA SMITH That you would n't be  --  sympathetic to this play ? LINDA EASTERBROOK But why should n't I be ? I am really hurt . AMANDA SMITH ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry  --  I 'm terribly sorry  --  I should n't have  --  p. 95 LINDA EASTERBROOK But you 're not in the least sorry . You have probably never in your life been so ecstatically happy as you are at this moment . AMANDA SMITH ( Stops and turns a step toward LINDA ) But really , Mrs.Easterbrook ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Cheerfully ) Call me Linda ! Shall we be honest with each other ? It 's enormously difficult , I know . But shall we try ? You enjoy inspiring Gav . AMANDA SMITH Yes  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK That is to say you enjoy sleeping with him . I understand that perfectly . AMANDA SMITH Oh , but that 's not true  --  we have n't  --  that 's not true . LINDA EASTERBROOK If it 's not true already then it 's imminent . You 'll inspire him into it . I do n't mind telling you I 'm intensely jealous . Sleep with him if you like but for pity 's sake do n't ruin his style . ( She rises  --  moves away to down R. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : Oh , really , Mandy ! AMANDA SMITH ( Puts out her cigarette on table L. Her cello voice vibrates slowly and richly ) We ca n't really talk  --  because we have nothing  --  ( Turns to Linda ) absolutely nothing  --  in common . p. 96 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) What about Gay ! AMANDA SMITH ( Her hand on chair R. side of table ) In my poor puny way I 've been trying to bring his work into relation to the period in which he is living . I want him to stop fiddling while Rome burns . I am afraid you are selfish , Linda . LINDA EASTERBROOK Of course I am . What are you ? AMANDA SMITH I feel that Gay might be great  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK What 's the matter with him now ? AMANDA SMITH His work is brilliant but  --  I have told him so myself  --  trivial . LINDA EASTERBROOK Why ? Because he writes comedy ? I 'd rather have him write trivial comedy than shallow tragedy . ( Moves to L. end of sofa @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an influence  --  with a capital I ! AMANDA SMITH ( Moves a step toward LINDA ) I do . I am not ashamed of it . That 's the best a woman can be . To inspire a brilliant man to become a great one . History is full of women who  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Goes to R. side of C. stool ; kneels on it . Breaks in ) I doubt it . Women may have stimulated men  --  to success  --  but I do n't believe in First Aids to greatness . That 's something else again . p. 97 AMANDA SMITH We 're at opposite poles . ( Turns and goes to below L. side of table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks toward the library door ) We are indeed . I wish I were at yours . ( A pause . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA ) You and Philo are so alike . ( Moves to upstage C. ) Both isolated in your own strenghts , in your own careers , your own egotisms . LINDA EASTERBROOK Why do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down to beside chair R. of table ) You are laughing at me . LINDA EASTERBROOK Did you never ? AMANDA SMITH But I will answer that . Philo is beyond reach . I have done everything I could to make him  --  outgiving . In the beginning I thought I could help him . That 's why I married him . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( With unconcealed malice ) Is that the only reason ? AMANDA SMITH I do n't expect you to understand . LINDA EASTERBROOK Why do n't you inspire to greatness someone obscure ? Would n't that be more exciting ? ( Moves to L. end of sofa ; sits on arm. ) p. 98 AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down a few steps ) The artist who has arrived and who begins to doubt his talents  --  there is no more poignant tragedy than that . LINDA EASTERBROOK If this play you 're drawing out of Gay like a bad tooth turns out to be good I 'll never forgive you , Mandy ! AMANDA SMITH ( Turns and goes to below R. end of table ; arranges @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any rate . LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . Why do n't you try it  --  just for the novelty ? AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA . Stiffly  --  she finds herself suddenly on the verge of tears ) I beg your pardon  --  ! LINDA EASTERBROOK You do n't believe this act of yours , do you ? You ca n't possibly . You 've got Gay through  --  this rainbow-belief in the profundity of his literary powers  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Nearer still to tears ) How dare you ! How dare you ! LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's all in fun  --  come clean , Mandy  --  I wish you could teach me the technique  --  all this pastel theorizing  --  wonderful dim lighting for sex . p. 99 AMANDA SMITH ( Moves a step down . Hurt to the quick , throwing all discretion to the winds suddenly ) I understand  --  I understand everything now ! LINDA EASTERBROOK What ? AMANDA SMITH He 's always talking , about your clairvoyance , your critical faculty of which he 's afraid , your pitiless clarity  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK My God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! AMANDA SMITH ( Moves a step down ) You are ! You 've shrivel ed him ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Is Gay shrivelled ? He looked awfully well this afternoon . AMANDA SMITH In his soul ! You do n't believe in faith or hope  --  you do n't believe in anything but empty laughter . You 're merciless and destructive . ( Moves to above C. stool toward LINDA ) If I have furnished him with an oasis where he can escape to brood and dream I 'm happy  --  do you hear  --  ( Turns and moves away to below table L. )  --  proud and happy ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Aloud to herself in a sudden dreadful revelation ) My God ! You believe it ! I 'm sunk ! p. 100 AMANDA SMITH ( Starts R. toward library door ) It 's inconceivable to you that anyone can be sincere  --  you do n't understand the truth  --  you attribute the most sordid motives to everything  --  ( Breaks down and weeps . Stops in front of door , her hand on doorknob and turns to LINDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I  --  I  --  hate you ! ( Goes out , slamming the door . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks after her . From her lips escapes involuntarily an exclamation of admiration at her rival 's self-absorption , her capacity for self-justification , her talent for being aggrieved . She puts her hands on her hips and stares after AMANDA . Below L. end of sofa ) And besides all that  --  you can cry . Well  --  ! ( She looks about the room . She becomes aware that her position is somewhat anomalous ; she is alone in AMANDA 'S house  --  that there is nothing left for her to do but go  --  that she is scarcely in position even to say " good night " to her hostess . She is unhappy and jealous  --  but she decides to make the best of it  --  sitting there alone in AMANDA 'S beautifully-lit living room ; suddenly , herself overcome by an emotion her poise can no longer avert , she rises , moves to below the sofa and picks up her bag there and starts across @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ quickens . She is already near the door when GAY comes in R. , slamming the door . GAY is dark with anger. ) p. 101 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moves to below sofa ) What have you done to Mandy ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Turns to him ) Disfigured her beyond recognition . Scatched her eyes out . Did n't you notice ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Inexorable , quivering with anger ) What did you say to her ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Do n't remember . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks toward library door ) She 's sobbing ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves to below stool by table ) How nice for her ! Wish I could ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at her ) You spy on me . You come here to spy on me . ( Goes to below stool C. ) And you must have said something unforgivable to Mandy  --  I know your capacity for that . She 's devastated ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Not so devastated , she lost her sense of direction .

GAYLORD EASTERBROOK It 's the end ! I ca n't stand it any more . I ca n't stand you any more . Your beautiful superiority . I loathe it . I 'm sick of it . You ca n't even be humanly jealous . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quickly ) That 's what you think . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Mandy 's human at least ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Obviously ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns and moves a few steps toward her , but avoiding her gaze ) I hate your detachment . ( She turns , goes to chair down L. and sits ) I hate your coolness . I hate your destructive critical nature . ( Turns away from her . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK You 've acquired Mandy 's vocabulary . Pity . So cliche . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns and looks at her . Though @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to marry Mandy . LINDA EASTERBROOK My blessings ! p. 103 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) You think I 'm joking ! LINDA EASTERBROOK I think you 're childish . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I know you do . ( Turns and goes to below sofa . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Your most endearing trait . ( A pause . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( His back to her ) I 'm going to marry Mandy . LINDA EASTERBROOK But why ? You 're not in love with her  --  I simply ca n't believe you 're in love with her ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moves to below C. stool . The more bitter as what LINDA is saying is true ) Ca n't you ? Nevertheless I am  --  madly in love with her ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Wistfully ) Would you love me , Gay , if I praised you for qualities you have n't got ? Would you love me if I could cry ? I 'll practice . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Always clear ! Always articulate ! Saharalighting ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quickly ) No vaguely-lit oasis , like this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . What can I do ? p. 104 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Bent on hurting her , bent on destroying her ) Oh , I 'll tell you what you can do ! You can preen yourself ! You can revel in your superiority ! You can pity us for this childish emotion which has involved us . ( Backs away a few steps to below sofa ) You do n't need me . You do n't need anybody . You 're self-sufficient . You can return to the narcissism which satisfies you really though you pretend it does n't ! ( Linda rises and moves a few steps toward him . She is deeply wounded , and , he is so bitter , a bit frightened . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves over toward GAY ) Gay ! Darling , do n't say things like this to me ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Backs away a few steps from her . Beyond appeal ) You can return to gaze at yourself forever in a full-length mirror ! ( He turns upstage a step away from her ) Oh , God  --  ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ miserable ! ( He says nothing , stands there trembling with anger , his back to her , with hate in his eyes . A painful and at the same time comforting truth forces itself in on her ) This is n't the ecstacy of new-found love  --  ! p. 105 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Almost shouting his denial ) It is ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves toward him ) Oh , Gay  --  ! ( Is close to him , her arms extended out to him , to embrace him , to shield him . He starts to back away from her , toward the library door . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( In a fury at being discovered ) No ! Do n't come near me ! Do n't question me ! I  --  I ca n't bear you , I tell you . Quit spying on me ! ( Flings out through the library door , slamming it behind him . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Oh , Gay darling  --  ( And again LINDA finds herself alone . She stands below sofa looking at the door . She turns and looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the door L. ) Well  --  ( As she passes below the C. stool , she pauses . An overpowering and thrilling realization comes over her first of all  --  that GAY is not really in love with AMANDA  --  that he wants only for some obscure reason to hurt her and punish himself . She is filled suddenly with hope , with a kind of joy , with a determination to fight . She turns and looks again at the library door , then smiles and moves deliberately over to sofa . She flings her bag down on the sofa , picks up one of the back cushions , places it as a head-rest against L. arm of sofa , then reclines on the sofa , facing the door. ) p. 106 PHILO SMITH ( After a few moments , the door L. opens and PHILO comes in . He sees LINDA , closes door quietly behind himself and moves to below backgammon table ) Good evening ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Turns quickly toward him . Startled for a moment , then delighted to see him ) Hello ! Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Another step toward her . Very formal ) Thank you . LINDA EASTERBROOK Oh , but I 've never been so glad to see anyone in all my life . PHILO SMITH You are impulsive . LINDA EASTERBROOK I feel as if I 've known you forever . PHILO SMITH You have n't . LINDA EASTERBROOK That 's the way I feel . I 've just found out  --  What do you think I 've just found out  --  ( He expresses no curiosity ) You were right , Mr. Smith , this afternoon  --  Mandy and my husband  --  are engaged . Yet he does n't love her  --  I 'm sure of that . He just wants , for some obscure reason , to hurt me and punish himself . PHILO SMITH He has chosen an excellent way to achieve both  --  ( A pause. ) p. 107 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks away . She is deflated suddenly ) Yes  --  Now I come to think of it  --  I 'm in despair . PHILO SMITH Do n't indulge yourself . LINDA EASTERBROOK He can talk out his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And he ca n't talk to me because I am . ( Turns to PHILO ) Why is that , do you suppose ? Why ca n't married people talk to each other ? PHILO SMITH Do n't ask me metaphysical questions . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) Well , I am going to fight . I am going to make a fight . ( Looks at him ) Will you help me ? PHILO SMITH Up to a point . LINDA EASTERBROOK Are you sleepy ? PHILO SMITH If I were I would n't have come down  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Do you play games ? ( Rises ; goes to C. stool . ) PHILO SMITH I play chess . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Sits ; looks away from him ) I should have though so  --  I do n't , unfortunately  --  ( Looks at the backgammon table , then at PHILO ) Do you play backgammon ? ( WARN Curtain. ) p. 108 PHILO SMITH Yes . LINDA EASTERBROOK Will you play backgammon with me ? ( With a twinkle in her eye , gay again ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave this house tonight without first saying good night to my hostess . Yes  --  I 'm too well-bred . And I ca n't possibly interrupt her just now . She and Gay are collaborating so hard  --  I must n't interrupt the creative process . At the same time  --  I do n't mind telling you  --  I want a good excuse to outstay her . PHILO SMITH Very well . ( Turns ; goes to chair R. side of the table . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Philo  --  you 're a darling ! PHILO SMITH ( Looks at her ) Do n't be familiar ! ( Sits , takes out his glass case and puts on his glasses  --  leaves case on table . He examines backgammon setup ; arranges a few counters . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Rises ; goes around above the table to L. side of it ) How you enjoy being crotchety ! You do n't fool me , you know . You do n't fool me a bit ! ( He says nothing . She picks up the dice-cup and shakes it ) Mandy says @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for her throw ) Both strong characters . ( She pulls chair closer to table ) I do n't feel my strength just now . ( She sits ) My strength is in abeyance . I do n't mind telling you , Philo , that I 'm just holding on by the skin of my teeth ! ( He still says nothing  --  suddenly she finds him looking at her , staring at her . She leans back in her chair ) Am I keeping you up by any chance ? p. 109 PHILO SMITH ( Looking at set-up . Snaps irritatedly at her ) You already have . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Amazed ) What ? PHILO SMITH ( Same voice ) It 's way past my bedtime ! ( Looks at her ) Why do you suppose I came downstairs ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Her amazement growing that he is aware of her at all and for even a moment as a human being . She leans forward over table ; thumps her dice-cup on table ) Philo ! This is so sudden ! PHILO SMITH ( Pointing to backgammon @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ QUICK CURTAIN LINDA EASTERBROOK ( As the Curtain falls ) I could hug you  --  I really could ! ( Moves abruptly , with only a quick glance at the counters and her eyes returning instantly to his . By this time , though , his gaze is fixed hard on the board. ) @x Early afternoon the next day . Sunshine streams through the window , making the room cheerful and bright . There is a tall glass vase of flowers on the console . The Center door is closed , as is the door Right . At Rise : LINDA is reclining on the downstage end of the sofa . She wears her reading glasses and has in her hand a typed manuscript  --  it is the first act and a quick outline of the second and third acts of GAY 'S play , " Dilemma . LINDA is just finishing the last page . Her expression is very grave . She lets the script fall in her lap . She is lost in profound thought  --  she is deeply stirred by an emotion which is undiscoverable till she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the script again . Carefully , she puts the unbound pages together . She runs through the script to see that it is in order . She puts her hand on the first page , palm flat . Then she takes the whole sheaf , finds on the desk a large manilla envelope in which the script came and carefully puts it back in the envelope . A KNOCK on the door up Center . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Abstractedly , puts envelope down on desk , upstage end ) Yes  --  ? CLEMENTINE ( Opens the R. side of double door partly and pokes her head through ) Miss Linday , dere 's a lady in de lobby . p. 111 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( In despair ) But I told you I was n't home to anybody . CLEMENTINE ( Still holding on to doorknob ) I told her dat but she says she knows you is home . LINDA EASTERBROOK Who is it ? CLEMENTINE Mrs. Smith she says she is . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Takes off her glasses , swings her feet to floor . Not too surprised ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you " Mandy . " ( Moves down to behind C. chair ) Who is dis Mrs. Smith ? Does she belong wid dat Mr. Smith was here yesterday ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Answering mechanically ) Wife . CLEMENTINE ( Smelling a rat ) We seem to have dem Smiths in our hair . What 's de matter wid ' em ? Ai n't day got no home of dere own ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Just exactly what did she say ? CLEMENTINE She says it 's  --  ( Imitating AMANDA ) ab-so-lutely necessary  --  she just got to come up . ( She folds her arms and gives her opinion of AMANDA ) Lordy , she talks like she 's gonner faint de very next second . ( A moment 's pause , then in her confidential , praying way ) Is de boss playin ' around wid her , Miss Lindy ? p. 112 LINDA EASTERBROOK Stop chattering , Clementine  --  CLEMENTINE ( Belligerently ) ' Cause if he is I 'll jest nacherally mutiliate her ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Deciding quickly ) Ask her to come up . CLEMENTINE @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desk ) It 's de first time de boss ever stayed out all night on us  --  Do n't like him doin ' dat when he ai n't been drinkin ' .

Into the receiver ) Dere 's a Mrs. Smith callin ' on 2103 . Will you send her up to 2104 , please . Thank you .

CLEMENTINE ( Disappointed ) Oh , dat 's true . He do n't answer de telephone an ' he do n't answer de doorbell . Dat man 's jest nacherally deaf to all kinds of ringin ' . LINDA EASTERBROOK He 's not deaf . He 's just acutely sensitive to the annoyance of the ringer ! CLEMENTINE Dis Mandy  --  is she pretty ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Very . CLEMENTINE Well , I knows one thing  --  if he was out last night  --  he was n't wid dat one . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks at CLEMENTINE and ca n't resist testing CLEMENTINE 'S logic ) Why ? CLEMENTINE Because she sounded awfully blue  --  praise de Lord ! ( LINDA exchanges an understanding look with CLEMENTINE and laughs . The door BUZZER rings . LINDA gestures for CLEMENTINE to answer it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ R. toward the front door . LINDA returns to behind lower end of desk , opens the desk drawer and replaces comb in it , then goes quickly upstage behind the desk , around it and down front of sofa . She stops front of lower end of sofa and glances swiftly around the room . Satisfied , she faces up toward the door and waits to receive AMANDA . The front DOOR is heard to open and then close . AMANDA 'S voice is heard , speaking to CLEMENTINE. ) p. 114 AMANDA SMITH Thank you  --  ( AMANDA appears in the hall , followed by CLEMENTINE . AMANDA enters the room and stands up C. To LINDA ) Oh , you must think me terribly  --  persistent . ( CLEMENTINE closes the C. door , scrutinizing AMANDA as she does so . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Not at all . I 'm very sorry that Clementine told you I was out . I had some reading to do and I shut off the telephone . AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down to behind R. side of C. chair ) I shall @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm quite finished . Will you have a drink ? AMANDA SMITH No , thank you . LINDA EASTERBROOK A cigarette , then ? AMANDA SMITH Yes . ( LINDA moves upstage to upper end of desk , picks up the cigarette case and a box of matches there , then moves to behind C. chair , L. of AMANDA , and offers open case to AMANDA , who takes one . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK It seems to me a great gap of time since last night . Does it to you ? AMANDA SMITH Not really . I 'm afraid I was awfully rude . p. 115 LINDA EASTERBROOK If I remember correctly  --  I was insufferable . ( She strikes a match and lights cigarette for Amanda . ) AMANDA SMITH Oh , Linda dear  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK I 've been thinking and thinking . Last night you opened up new vistas to me . I began to see myself as odious , destructive . You , I thought , were more audacious than I. Supposing that in your library  --  Gay was giving birth  --  with you as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to upper end of sofa and returns the case and matches to desk ) This , I thought , might be one of those very and great occasions that love makes and here was I standing in the way . ( Turns to AMANDA ) I wavered . I retreated . I took myself away  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down to below C. chair ) I came back to apologize  --  but you had gone . ( Sits on chair . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I came back here and called up Pym . He sat up till dawn , holding my hand . I made a new resolution  --  AMANDA SMITH Did you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves around to front of upper end of sofa ) To appreciate and inspire and convert myself  --  into a general builder-upper ! ( Sits on upstage end of sofa ) You see , Mandy , what an influence you are  --  not only on Gay  --  but on me ! p. 116 AMANDA SMITH ( With a wan smile , a little frightened ) And have you begun ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Perking up . She does n't know what has happened since last she saw GAY ) No ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Gay did n't come home last night . AMANDA SMITH ( Greatly relieved ) Oh , did n't he ? LINDA EASTERBROOK No . AMANDA SMITH Then you have n't seen him ? LINDA EASTERBROOK No . ( Looks intently at AMANDA ) Have n't you ? AMANDA SMITH ( Looks away ) No . I was sure he 'd be here . I 'm really frightfully worried . I 've called his studio  --  there was no answer . ( Looks at LINDA ) Suppose something has happened to him ! LINDA EASTERBROOK He 's all right . I 've heard from him . AMANDA SMITH ( Unable to bear it ) Oh , have you ? Did he telephone ? LINDA EASTERBROOK No . He sent me his play . p. 117 AMANDA SMITH ( Amazed ) Dilemmal ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . AMANDA SMITH Oh  --  ! Well ? LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's only one act really  --  AMANDA SMITH ( Quickly ) But surely you can tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Sits back and looks away ) You do n't like it ! I feel you do n't  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's so out of Gay 's normal vein that I must say I was a bit startled . Perhaps it 's not my dish . AMANDA SMITH ( Miffed ) He always felt you would n't be sympathetic to it . ( A moment 's pause , then she looks at LINDA ) Linda  --  I have something to tell you . LINDA EASTERBROOK Have you ? AMANDA SMITH Yes  --  it 's an awful thing  --  I  --  ( Rises , goes to L. end of table and puts her cigarette in ashtray there ) I do n't Know how to put it  --  I really do n't  --  I  --  You make it impossible for me ! p. 118 LINDA EASTERBROOK Nothing is impossible for you , Mandy ! AMANDA SMITH ( Turns and moves to behind C. chair ) I wish , Linda , I did n't like you so very , very much  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK You will end , I am sure , by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ( A moment , then ) What is it ? AMANDA SMITH Well  --  Gay and I  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes ? AMANDA SMITH ( Looks away from LINDA ) Gay and I  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK I suspected it . AMANDA SMITH ( Turns to LINDA ) Oh , no.that ! It 's worse  --  from your point of view . Oh , believe me , Linda ! I struggled against this ! ( LINDA gives her a quick look ) Only last night  --  I told him I thought we ought never see each other again  --  his play was well on the way  --  my usefulness over . I entreated him to return to you  --  and then suddenly , out of a clear sky  --  he asked me to marry him . LINDA EASTERBROOK Infallible technique ! p. 119 AMANDA SMITH ( Loftily ) That 's unworthy of you , Linda . LINDA EASTERBROOK I 'm sorry . AMANDA SMITH ( Turns and moves to below C. chair ) I 'm really frightfully worried about Gay . LINDA EASTERBROOK You must get used to these little disappearances @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as a husband he 's practically nonexistent . ( The dial TELEPHONE on table rings . LINDA and AMANDA exchange a quick look . BOTH believe it may be a call from GAY . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Moves a step toward LINDA . Eagerly ) Oh  --  ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Rises and moves over behind AMANDA toward the phone . ) It may be  --  ( The PHONE rings again . LINDA goes behind the table and picks up the receiver . AMANDA turns and looks toward LINDA . Into receiver ) Yes  --  ? Hello  --  ( LINDA looks at AMANDA and shakes her head . AMANDA , disappointed that the call is not GAY 'S , turns and moves to up-stage end of sofa ) Yes , Philo  --  ( AMANDA , surprised , quickly turns and looks at LINDA , then returns to below the C. chair ) Not at all  --  Any time  --  Naturally . Goodbye . ( Hangs up , then looks at AMANDA. ) p. 120 AMANDA SMITH ( Unable to conceal her astonishment and even her pique ) Philo ! Not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away as she considers it ) When Robert told me last night he came downstairs  --  I could n't believe it ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Is that so irregular ? AMANDA SMITH ( Looks at LINDA ) Irregular ! It 's a revolution ! ( A moment  --  she is very curious ) After he came down  --  what did you do ? ( Sits on C. chair . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK We played backgammon . ( Moves to end , of L. lounge . ) AMANDA SMITH What did he say  --  about us  --  I mean Gay and me ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Very little . He 's not exactly  --  chatty . ( Sits on arm of L. lounge . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Looks away ) He likes you ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Do you mind ? AMANDA SMITH ( Looks at LINDA ) But it 's so astonishing ! p. 121 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Wryly ) Thank you ! AMANDA SMITH No , I did n't mean that  --  obviously any man would  --  you 're entrancing , my dear  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Thank you , Mandy ! AMANDA @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! LINDA EASTERBROOK He indicates a thaw ! AMANDA SMITH I knew last night he likes you . As a matter of fact  --  it just strikes me  --  you and Philo  --  made for each other ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Do you think so ? AMANDA SMITH Yes . Both strong  --  self-reliant  --  ambitious . And you have this in common  --  you know what you want and you go after it  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK I should n't say in your quiet way that you lack tenacity ! AMANDA SMITH ( Rises and moves over to front of sofa ) Oh , it 's going to be so difficult . Philo is so old-fashioned  --  his sons and all . He 'll never give me a divorce . ( Turns to LINDA ) Unless  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes. ? p. 122 AMANDA SMITH Well , I just had a curious idea  --  a curious hunch  --  that you might persuade him . LINDA EASTERBROOK Did you really ? AMANDA SMITH ( Delighted with her idea ) Yes . Why prolong a marriage that has outlived its validity ? You , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . LINDA EASTERBROOK I have n't any grown sons at Harvard ! AMANDA SMITH All the more reason . He has his sons  --  he has his books  --  his life is full . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( After a moment ) What makes you think that I am willing to give up Gay ? AMANDA SMITH ( Generously ) Because you are a big person , Linda . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quickly ) It 's not a question of size ! AMANDA SMITH Gay no longer loves you , Linda . LINDA EASTERBROOK I am not convinced . AMANDA SMITH He loves me . LINDA EASTERBROOK Perhaps he does . AMANDA SMITH He told me so . He asked me to marry him . ( GAY opens the R. side of the c. door and comes in . He is aquiver with nervous tension . He has not slept , he has been drinking but he is not in the least drunk . Since we last saw him , GAY has undergone a thousand changes of mood and of plan  --  but one emotion has remained constant : despair in a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no good . He would die rather than admit it but he is here because he can no longer endure the suspense of waiting for LINDA 'S opinion  --  he wants it passionately though he has a sickening conviction of what it will be  --  he wants to hear it from her own lips , the death-sentence from her own lips , the confirmation of his despair and get it over with . The fact that AMANDA is there  --  necessarily delaying the execution  --  drives him crazy . He stands just inside the door , wearing his hat , and looks at LINDA , then at AMANDA . AMANDA rises ; joyous and reproachful at once ) Gay ! Gay dear ! Where have you been ? p. 123 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What are you doing here ? AMANDA SMITH I was frantic . You were to telephone  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I did . AMANDA SMITH ( Goes up to behind C. chair , L. of him ) When ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Just now . AMANDA SMITH But you were to call me at noon . I waited hours . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was n't at the studio . AMANDA SMITH I was sure you must be here  --  I did n't know what to do  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in , shouting ) I resent your spying on me ! I wo n't be spied on ! ( AMANDA is staggered . She does n't know what to do under this barrage . She backs away a step from GAY and covers her face in her hands , on the verge of tears . GAY moves down to front of lower end of sofa ) And do n't cry , for God 's sake ! ( In her bewilderment and despair , AMANDA turns to LINDA . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quietly to GAY ) She 's not me , you know , Gay . She 's not used to your infantile tantrums . p. 124 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to LINDA . Ominously ) Please do n't give me any of your Olympian advice . ( Takes off his hat and throws it on the sofa ) I came here to pack  --  ( Turns and starts across downstage toward @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ here once and for all . AMANDA SMITH ( Turns toward GAY , completely restored by this , smiles through her tears ) Really , Gay ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( To her amused ) Feel better , dear ? ( Rises and follows behind GAY toward the door ) I 'll get your things ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stops in front of door and turns to LINDA ) Do n't touch my things . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Stops abrupily ) Very well , ( Turns and starts up for the c. door ) I sha n't touch your things . ( Goes between L. lounge and c. chair , up to door ; exits , closing door behind her . Then she opens the door quickly ; pokes her head in . To AMANDA ) Never touch his things ! ( Closes the door behind her . ) ( GAY finally in contrition , moves to the L. lounge and sits. ) p. 125 AMANDA SMITH Gay , darling , how could you accuse me of spying on you ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I 'm sorry , darling . I 'm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of lounge ) Of course  --  it 's only that I was so worried about you  --  that 's all . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Pats her hand ) Oh , dearest ! You 're an angel . ( Pauses for a moment ) We 're going to Spain ! AMANDA SMITH ( A little surprised ) What ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I just ran into a newspaper feller just back from Madrid . I had a hell of a talk with him  --  AMANDA SMITH When do we go ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Right away ! AMANDA SMITH But your play ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK The play 's no good ! AMANDA SMITH ( Wounded , her own child ) Gay ! How can you say that  --  ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in , quickly ) Never mind ! The Hell with it ! p. 126 AMANDA SMITH ( Places her hand on his shoulder and bends over him ) You 're depressed . Everyting 's been too much for you . ( Backs away a step ) You ought to be left alone for a bit . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Irritated ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been alone too damm much ! It 's just that I 'm  --  ( Looks at her , then turns and looks at door R. Irresolutely ) I 've got to get my things out of here  --  AMANDA SMITH Shall I go home and wait for you there ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh , no  --  Darling  --  ( Thinks for a moment ) Would you mind waiting for me downstairs in the cocktail bar ? AMANDA SMITH ( Turns and starts for door up C. Delighted ) No , of course not ! ( Stops at the door as her eye catches sight of script envelope on the desk . She ca n't suppress inquiry that has been gnawing her . She turns toward GAY ) Gay  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Abstractedly ) Yes  --  ? AMANDA SMITH ( Moves downstage to behind c. chair ) Why did you send Linda the play ? p. 127 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Rises ; goes up to R. of her , Furious ) Did She tell you that ? AMANDA SMITH Yes . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Off again ) She 's a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Oh , God  --  ! ( Controls himself with difficulty ; turns to AMANDA ) Well  --  what did she say about it ? AMANDA SMITH She said it 's not her dish ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns away to L. end of lounge . Insincere bravado ) That 's a compliment ! AMANDA SMITH ( Moves down a few steps toward him ) Of course it is  --  the play is wonderful ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What the Hell do you know about it ? AMANDA SMITH Oh  --  ! ( Turns and goes to behind chair c. and stands with her back to him . She is dumb with surprise and misery . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Realizing what he has just said ) Oh ! ( Is stricken for having said it at the same time he is so nervy that he ca n't stand this interview another second . He turns , goes over to R. of her , places his arms around her shoulder and turns her face to him ) Please , darling , I 'm a brute  --  I know I m a brute but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sorry . But there are times between people when they should n't discuss anything , when to exchange any but the most casual remarks is to run a gauntlet . Darling , be a good girl . Go down to the cocktail-bar . Sit on a stool and have a drink . Presently I 'll join you . I 'll sit on a stool beside you and I 'll have a drink . We 'll be very happy . p. 128 AMANDA SMITH ( Sees it is necessary to beat a retreat ) How long will you be ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Well , just five minutes  --  ( Takes her arm end walks her up toward the door . ) AMANDA SMITH ( Kisses him on cheek ) I 'll give you ten  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Open door ) Oh , darling  --  that 's not really necessary  --  I 've only got to get together some manuscripts  --  ( AMANDA . goes through door , out into hall and toward front door .

GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No , darling By the time you 've finished one cocktail  --  ( A moment 's pause . He is kissing her goodbye . How can she know  --  since he does not in the least suspect it himself  --  that it is a valeidctory kiss . The front DOOR is heard closing . GAY comes back into the room . He sees CLEMENTINE arranging liquor things on the console . He stands below the door. ) p. 129 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Clementine , you 're psychic ! ( Goes over to L. end of the console and picks up the Scotch decanter . ) CLEMENTINE ( Backs away a step to r. end of consloe . At her most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dat Mrs. Smith ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Puts decanter stoper down on tray with a bang and faces CLEMENTINE . She leans on R. end of console and watches him , without concern . His voice alive with menace ) I return , Black Beauty , to perform one final rite  --  CLEMENTINE she 's so wispy she do n't look like she 's goin ' to last out de winter . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK One final rite which will aford me intense pleasure ! ( Turns to tray , pours a drink into glass and starts to drink it . ) CLEMENTINE She talks so gaspy  --  what she got ? De asthma ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stops drinking ; turns to her ) You odious barbarian  --  one more word out of you and I 'll eviscerate you ! CLEMENTINE ( Straightens up , looks at him intently , then waves her arm at him as she goes around end of r. lounge and across up toward door c . Faintly misunderstanding ) Do n't go makin ' up to me . I'se off you ! ( Continues on her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ( Looks at her , surprise mingled with despair , takes a long swallow of his drink , picks up decounter and then moves down to behind L. end of table ) Excuse me  --  ( CLEMENTINE stops upstage R. side of C. chair and turns to him , patiently watching him ) Excuse me , but you 're fired . Do you hear that ? You get out of here right away . My final officil act in this transient establishment  --  clear out ! This time you 're fired for good ! ( Pours another drink . ) CLEMENTINE Lordy , Boss , de way Miss Lindy feels about you right now  --  you'se lucky if you ai n't fired yo'self . Now I knows Miss Lindy an ' I 'm warmin you , her " patient " is jest about run out . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Muraerous ) Oh , it is ! CLEMENTINE ( Pointing her finger at him ) Yes , it is . An ' you better take my tip an ' make up to her  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in angrily . Holds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before I throw this decanter at you ! CLEMENTINE ( Unruffled ) Yeath ? p. 131 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK So help me ! CLEMENTINE Lordy , Boss , you 're such a lush you 'd never throw dat decanter  --  not while dere 's licker in it ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( A pause . GAY puts the decanter gently down on the table , then turns to her with dignity ) What you do not appear to recognize is that my mood is exceptional ! CLEMENTINE ( Sizing him up as if for the last time , resgined to the sad fact ) you 're jest like my man exactly  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Inaudible with rage ) Oh , no , I 'm not  --  CLEMENTINE Full o ' entertainment but juest nacherally no good . I hate to see you go . ( Turns up toward the door ) I 'll see what I can do for you wid Miss Lindy . ( Shuffles out , closing the door . ) ( GAY is left alone . His temper is demonic but turned in on himself  --  a good of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  every inner convictionand every objecttive support  --  he is lost in chaos ! He finishes his drink , picks up the decanter and begins pouring another drink when his eye catches the manuscript envelope on the desk . He puts down his glass on the table , goesto C. door , listens there for a moment , then continues over to desk . He picks up the envelope , opens the flap , takes out the unbound script and begins to leaf through the pages . At this moment the sound of someone 's FOOTSTEPS in the hall makes him quickly replace the script into the envelope and throw it down on the desk . He quickly takes a cigarette from the box on the desk . LINDA opens the door and enters the room , leaving door open . She glances about the room , looking for AMANDA , then goes over to behind the desk. ) p. 132 LINDA EASTERBROOK Where 's Mandy ? ( Picks up several pencils on the desk , looking for a sharpened one . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Downstairs in the cocktail-bar . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK She tells me you 're getting married . Is it true ? ( Replaces all but one pencil on the desk , then picks up a small scratch-pad . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes . We 're going to Spain . LINDA EASTERBROOK Peculiar place for a honeymoon . Why Spain ? I might even add , if I were malicious  --  ( Goes around upstage end of desk up toward the door , carrying pencil and pad ) why Mandy ? ( Goes out into hall and off L. ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Vibrating with anger against her ) I 'll tell you why ! ( Throws the match-box down on desk ) Toget away from you ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Reappears in the open door ) But the world is wide  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns up toward her . Passionately ) It 's not wide . It 's narrow . It 's close . It 's a closet . ( Goes up to L. of her ) I 'm shut in it with you  --  and i 've got claustrophobia . ( Backs away a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from you . I 've got to break your hold on me . ( Turns and goes down to upstage end of sofa , thrwing cigarette on the floor ) Damn it , Linda  --  I 've got to marry Mandy or somebody because it 's the only way I can be unfaithful to you ! ( Sits on upstage arm of sofa. ) p. 133 LINDA EASTERBROOK That 's the sweetest thing you ever said to me , darling . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at her ) You 're being very funny , are n't you ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Not at all . I had no idea we were so close . I had no idea we were in a closet together . I really had n't . I thought you were unfaithful to me regularly and with ease . I 'm delighted to discover you have to marry to achieve it . It seemsa cumbersome method  --  but I must say I 'm highly flattered . Thank you , darling ! ( Turns and goes out into hall and into her room and off L. ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Re-enters the hall from her room . Lost for the moment in the contemplation of another vista ) What ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Do n't ask me what . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Enters room to below the door ) Oh  --  the play  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Yes  --  have you read it ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Yes . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Well ? p. 134 LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's not easy to say in a word . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK If you lie to me I 'll break your neck . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Quietly ) I have no intention of lying to you . ( Closes the door and moves down to end of L. lounge . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stands up and moves to L. side of c. chair ) Well , tell me , then . Tell me the worst ! LINDA EASTERBROOK I was very touched by your sending it to me . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes above c. chair and across to behind table ) Oh , the Hell with that ! I know myself but I want to hear it from you . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ L. loungeand sits ) I knew it last night in Mandy 's library . ( Goes around end of R. lounge to below it ) It all came over me in a dreadful  --  what the Hell was I doing , with this idea , with these characters ? I knew then  --  it was terrible ! LINDA EASTERBROOK That 's nonsense and you know it 's nonsense . In a strange uncanny way the play 's fascinating . And you first act is wonderfully written . p. 135 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Sits on R. lounge , facing her . Breathing oxygen suddenly ) Oh , Londa darling  --  ! Do you really think so ? LINDA EASTERBROOK You could n't write anything terrible . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Linda darling , I did n't want you  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) Only  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Only what  --  ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I do n't see the reason for doing a play like this . What does it accomplish ? You tell a bereaved people who cling to a hope in immortality that their hope is an illusion . Why go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Because the whole notion of immortality is a destructive concept which keeps people from facing reality . People must learn to face the real world , then perhaps they 'll improve it . LINDA EASTERBROOK But who are you to say it 's an illusion ? How do you know ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I just say it 's healthier  --  and more practical  --  to assume that this is all we have . LINDA EASTERBROOK I do n't like your last act . Why does the boy have to kill himself ? p. 136 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK To save his father 's face . LINDA EASTERBROOK People are n't necessarily interesting because they 're dead . I hate ghost on the stgage . Even Hamlet 's father . He 's quite a bore . And above all , Gay  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Masochistic ) Yes , tell me  --  tell me everything  --  ( Covers his face with his hands . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I feel a revulsion from your play altogether  --  because it is dominated by the idea of death  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Uncovers his face , looks at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ death . Death is our hero , our protagonist  --  war and death  --  death and the fear of death . Death purrs over us , a huge bombing-plane  --  its shadow darkening the green pastures , its bombs churning the still waters . That is why my play is dominated by the idea of death  --  because we are . LINDA EASTERBROOK What if we are ? It is more profound to write of death of which we know nothing than of life of which we may illuminate , if only briefly , with gaiety and understanding . Gay , do n't turn your back on the gift you have , the instinct you have , the power you have  --  p. 137 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) No  --  It 's not that  --  that 's not the trouble . LINDA EASTERBROOK Then what ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK It 's that I have n't pulled it off . LINDA EASTERBROOK Is it worth pulling off ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Oh , it is  --  supremely  --  if only I could . This is only your way of telling me  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No  --  ( Rises , goes below her over to behind C. chair ) I wanted to hear it from you  --  I wanted confirmation  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Probably your play would be produced and received as the profoundest thing you 've ever done . A masterpiece even . Only I should n't be convinced . But who am I ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Following his own conviction ) No , I 've failed or you would n't say these things . I saw it clearly enough last night  --  in Mandy 's library . LINDA EASTERBROOK You saw what in Mandy 's library ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) That my play was inadequate to its idea  --  indignation without form  --  passion without authority  --  I knew then exactly what it would be  --  not tragic but thin , petulant . p. 138 LINDA EASTERBROOK But even if it were everything you wanted it to be  --  still I should bnot be impressed . Your hero says that in Spain he 's learned how to die and that now he will practice what he has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ knows how to die . Millions of people know how to die  --  in any case it is an art that sooner or later Nature imposes upon us all  --  no , Gay , the difficult thing is to live  --  that requires skill . That requires imagination  --  that 's the index of civilization  --  the ability to live , not the ability to die . Do n't spin for me fantasies of death  --  imagine for me variations of life  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes around above desk to behind desk chair ) I shall go to Spain  --  where death is not a fantasy  --  but a reality ! LINDA EASTERBROOK But why , Gay ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) Ca n't you see that if this thing  --  ( Indicates his manuscript on desk ) is no good it 's because I have n't actually been through it  --  I have n't been through anything . ( Returns above the desk to below c. chair ) While I 'm imagining these charming variations  --  as you call them  --  people are dying  --  the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I improvise variations also  --  Mandy ! No , I 'm sick of it , sick of my work , sick of myself  --  I must get something clear and outside myself to be enlisted for . I 'm sick of the triviality , sick of ringing changes on what I 've already written , sick of the futility theme  --  If necessary , I swear to God , I want it shot out of myself ! ( Sits on the chair c. ) p. 139 LINDA EASTERBROOK It 's Mandy , then  --  you want to get away from Mandy . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Jumps up , paces to below sofa . Inaudibly ) Oh , for God 's sake  --  ! LINDA EASTERBROOK Insufficient motive , I should think , for leaving the country . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) It 's like you to pick on that  --  out of all I 've said  --  ( Goes to below the desk . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK I know you so well . ( A moment 's pause ) Suppose I get you out of this mess you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Angrily ) It 's no mess ! Your assumption that this is the major factor in my  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) I know . It drives you crazy . Nevertheless I 'll get you out of it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes behind desk to upstage end of it ) What makes you think I want to get out of it . LINDA EASTERBROOK Because it worries you  --  and it should ! p. 140 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Well , it does n't . ( A moment ) I 've asked Mandy to go to Spain with me . LINDA EASTERBROOK Mandy in Spain ! Darling  --  she 'll wait for you in Paris , I promise you  --  and shop ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Moves around to front of sofa ) Well , if she wo n't go she wo n't go . But I 've got to go in any case . I 've got to get up against a genuine experience  --  ( Sits on upstage end of sofa , looks at her ) What else will I do ? I 've got nothing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Reaches over and touches manuscript envelope on desk ) This thing  --  I 'll put away till I get back  --  I 'll see how it looks to me then  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK I know what you 're running away from . You feel empty and sterile at the moment and you hope to fill in the vaccum with experience . ( Turns toward him ) Oh , God , Gay , you 're leaving almost the only country left in the world where one may still live with a little decency  --  but paralyzed by fear . Stay here , while and where it is still possible to live . Is n't there this for you to say ? Is n't there this for you to insist on ? That the more inhuman the rest of the world the more human we . ( Rises and moves over to above c. chair ) The grosser and more cruel the others , the more scrupulous , and fastidious , the more precisely just and delicate we . p. 141 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( After a moment , looks at her ) That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bowing to each other on the way to the scaffold . LINDA EASTERBROOK They are pleasanter to remember than the knitting women . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Manner  --  divorced from justice  --  ( Rises , picks up envelope from desk , then goes downstage toward door R. ) the Hell with that ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Moves over to upstage end of sofa ; sits on arm facing R. After a moment ) Gay  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stops below R. lounge . His back to her ) Yes  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Let 's talk a little  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) Oh , darling , I 've got to go in and pack my lousy manuscripts . ( Continues on his way toward the door ) I get nausea when I think of them  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK I know perfectly well that if you had any idea you were excited about you would go  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stops on threshold of door , turns to her ) Well , I have n't an idea I 'm excited about . I have n't even an idea . ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I have . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns and looks intently at her for a moment , then turns again toward door with an exclamation ) Ahh  --  ! LINDA EASTERBROOK I think  --  I honestly think  --  that I have one  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Stops agains , turns and closes door behind him , then leans against downstage side of door jamb . Impatient and skeptical ) Well , what is it ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Mandy and me . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What are you talking about ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Write a play about Mandy and me . The two opposite types of women in the life of a man , the builder-upper and the breaker- downer  --  the critical faculty versus the clinging vine  --  What Every Woman Knows in Reverse . ( Rises and moves over to below l. lounge . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I see  --  you cast yourself for the superior role ! ( Loughs . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Sits on l. lounge ) No . There 's a lot to be said for Mandy . Great occasions , she says , great loves , make @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other woman  --  critical , skeptical  --  stay in your little street , cultivate your garden  --  do n't try to make a forest out of it  --  a playwright  --  you  --  for instance  --  caught between these two points of view  --  which wins out in the end ? Who does he stay with ? ( A pause. ) p. 143 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Begins moving slowly around behind table to below the l. lounge . Interested as a technician ) Hmmmm  --  ( Another moment as he ponders it ) Well  --  it would depend a good deal , I should think , on how the builder-upper 's advice worked out  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Closely watching his reaction ) Exactly  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Supposing , say , the play he wrote and produced under her influence were a great success  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK Then I 'd be sunk ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Fascinated for a moment ) might be interesting  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Holding her breath ) Right up your street ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Sits on l. lounge , places envelope down beside him ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ out ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK If the play is a success  --  it 's a toss-up . LINDA EASTERBROOK Odds on Mandy . p. 144 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK If it were n't  --  if it stank  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK What then ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK Then he 'd go to the builder-upper certainly . LINDA EASTERBROOK Think so ? Why ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK He 'd never forgive the wife for being right . LINDA EASTERBROOK Gay , that 's charming ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at her ) I hate you often because you know more than I do . ( Looks away ) Mandy massages my ego . It 's very pleasant . LINDA EASTERBROOK There , you see ! it 's right in your hands . ( A pause . GAY leans back , ruminating the theme . His face shows interest in the idea , and he begins to smile at the prospect of working it out . He turns to pick up the envelope on the lounge beside him , when his eye catches sight of LINDA 'S triumphant look . His face quickly changes its expression , his whole @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Strongly ) No ! ( Draws back into corner of lounge , looking away from her. ) p. 145 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Not giving up yet ) you could make the most amusing comedy of it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK What if I did ? LINDA EASTERBROOK I 'm afraid Mandy has made you pompous . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Turns to her ) people are n't interested in the problems of actresses  --  or playwrights . They 're interested in themselves . ( He rises and starts over to upstage end of desk ) We 're such exhibitionists that we think that because other writers and other actresses discuss us endlessly that the general public cares ! They do n't give a damn ! And they 're quite right ! ( The house TELEPHONE on desk rings . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Starting to speak as phone rings ) Yes , but  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Goes to behind upstage end of desk . Picks up receiver and answers ) Hello  --  Who  --  ? ( Lowers receiver , covers it with hand and looks at LINDA ) Philo ! ( While @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Tell him we 're very sorry but we ca n't  --  LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) Ask him to come up  --  p. 146 GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks off and looks at her sharply ) What ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Ask him to come up . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Into receiver , after a moment ) Send him up . ( Hangs up , looks at LINDA ) What are you doing with that stuffed shirt ? LINDA EASTERBROOK He 's less a stuffed shirt than you think . He 's recklessly , even insanely impulsive . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at her , then moves down a step to behind desk chair , then looks at her again ) That tycoon ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Smiling ) He propsed to me last night . ( BUZZER . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Startled , shakes his head in disbelief ) No ! LINDA EASTERBROOK I was quite bowled over . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Suddenly feels a cold fury of jealousy . He goes around below desk over to L. lounge , picks up the envelope and looks at her ) Why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fastens flap on envelope as he goes toward his door r. ) the two critical faculties  --  the two skeptics . You 'll produce a lot of question marks . ( He goes into room , closing door . ) ( The door BUZZER rings . LINDA looks at door R. after GAY ; reacts lightly to door buzzer . After a moment , CLEMENTINE opens C. door and looks into the room. ) p. 147 CLEMENTINE Miss Lindy  --  is you in ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Rises and goes over toward the sofa ) Yes . It 's Mr. Smith . Let him in . ( CLEMENTINE goes into hall off R. and opens front door to admit PHILO . LINDA picks up GAY 'S hat on sofa , moves around to behind lower end of desk , places hat on desk , looks in the mirror , then returns to front of lower end of sofa . ) CLEMENTINE ( At front door ) Wo n't you come in ? PHILO SMITH ( In hall ) Thank you . ( Philo comes into the room , to stand on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . CLEMENTINE follows in , standing below R. side of door , scrutinizing PHILO sideways in her fashion . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK Hello , Philo ! ( To CLEMENTINE ) Clementine , see if you can help Mr. Easterbrook if he needs you . CLEMENTINE Yes 'm . ( She closes the door , then goes above table to door R. and out , closing door behind her . ) LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Smiling at PHILO , conscious he is under a certain strain ) How are you , Philo ? p. 148 PHILO SMITH Apprehensive . LINDA EASTERBROOK Will you have a drink ? ( Sits on C. of sofa . ) PHILO SMITH No , thank you . ( After a moment ) Well , last night must seem fantastic to you . LINDA EASTERBROOK Not so fantastic as it must seem to you ! PHILO SMITH Yes . It is incredible to me also . And yet I went to sleep  --  thinking of you . I woke  --  thinking of you , and I am forty-eight . And yet  --  after two unsuccessful marriages  --  after a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tremble before you . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks away from him ) I am very touched , Philo . PHILO SMITH ( Moves over to upstaoge end of sofa ) I came to see you yesterday  --  not because I wanted to tell you about your husband and Amanda  --  that meant less than nothing to me  --  ( Places his hands on arm of sofa and bends over toward her ) I came because I wanted to see you  --  to talk to you  --  I came because , since I saw you at the Wylers ' , I could n't forget you  --  I could n't get you out of my mind . ( Straightens up and moves to below C. chair ) I thought : " I 'll go to see her  --  I 'll talk to her and this will cure me . " ( Turns to her ) The effect was the opposite . ( Sits on C. chair . Smiles at her ) Is this the onslaught of age ? Is this senility ? p. 149 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Smiles ) You ca n't expect @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I told you . I am happy you know . After so many years of the strictest logic , I am glad to have ventured the improbable . LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks at him ) I have been thinking of you  --  you have been in my mind . PHILO SMITH ( Leans forward ) To a conclusion ? LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Looks away from him and leans forward ) I do n't know . I am tired , Philo . But I must n't come to a conclusion  --  out of fatigue . You offer me peace , you offer me tranquillity and regularity  --  but are those enough ? ( Looks at him ) And what should I give you in return ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Enters R. door , leaving it open , and goes swiftly behind table over toward the upstage end of desk ) Where 's my passport ? Where the devil have you put it ? ( Goes behind desk , opens the upstage top drawer and begins to rummage in the papers in the drawer . ) ( PHILO glances at GAY on his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ away from GAY. ) p. 150 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Leans back on sofa ) I have n't put it . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK I gave it to you when I came back in July . LINDA EASTERBROOK You did n't . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK That impermeable robot of yours does n't know anything ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Gestures toward PHILO ) Have you met Mr. Smith ? GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Abruptly , without looking at PHILO ) Hello ! ( Slams the drawer shut ; opens center drawer . ) ( LINDA reacts at GAY 'S rudeness as though it were to be expected . ) PHILO SMITH ( Rises , stands below L. side of his chair ) How do you do ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Perhaps the passport is in your studio . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looking in the drawer ) It ca n't be . I never took it there . LINDA EASTERBROOK You might look in the little tin box in your closet . You throw things in there ! GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Remembering that is where he put it , straightens up , closes the drawer ) That 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ around below desk , across down-stage toward his door R. ) p. 151 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( To PHILO ) My husband is going to Spain . PHILO SMITH Really ? Why ? LINDA EASTERBROOK Fundamental experience . ( Gay stops below R. side of lounge , slowly turns and looks at PHILO . ) PHILO SMITH ( Skeptically ) Oh ? ( Turns and looks at GAY . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Slowly goes over to R. of PHILO . His instinct tells him he can find a legitimate issue on which to fight PHILO in the following direction ; he is bitterly jealous and resentful of what seems to him PHILO 'S assurance . Abruptly ) Are you interested in the Spanish struggle , Mr. Smith ? PHILO SMITH Not particularly . GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Loudly , just spoiling for a fight ) No ? PHILO SMITH I 'm sorry . I 'm interested as a student of human folly . But no more than that . ( Turns away from GAY . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK No more than that ! LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Desperate to ward it off ) @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Breaks in ) No , wait a minute . This is interesting . This beautiful detachment is interesting . It has n't aroused your anger that two aggressive countries have been using Spain as a battleground to fight an undeclared war ?  --  that women and children are being slaughtered  --  that has n't stirred you out of your detachment ? PHILO SMITH ( Turns to face GAY ) Mr. dear Mr. Easterbrook , I am afraid you see the world not as it is but as you would like it to be . The history of the human race is a disgraceful history . Civil war is no new thing in Spain . They fought the Carlist wars for forty years . They kill each other because they want to  --  that is their pastime . You are like the sentimental sts who divorce the totalitarian rulers from their peoples . No such divorce is possible . They have the governments they want , the governments they deserve . The average man is bloodthirsty and contemptible . The great satirists , Voltaire and Swift , knew that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even infantile . ( Turns and walks upstage a few steps . ) GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Looks at LINDA . Quietly ) You were saying exactly the same things just a few minutes ago . ( Goes over to below R. lounge ; turns toward them ) You two are made for each other obviously . I see you both cuddled together in a great cocoon of detachment . So happy ! ( Turns and goes toward R. door. ) p. 153 LINDA EASTERBROOK ( Rises ; moves quickly over to below L. lounge . Stricken ) Gay  --  Gay darling  --  GAYLORD EASTERBROOK ( Eaten up ) Really  --  perfect ! ( Goes out R. , closing the door . ) PHILO SMITH ( A pause . Then PHILO moves down to R. side of C. chair ) I 'm sorry . Are you angry with me ? LINDA EASTERBROOK No . PHILO SMITH You are . LINDA EASTERBROOK No  --  only you 've made me see  --  ( Sits on the L. lounge ) I 'm afraid , Philo , you 've made me see  --  PHILO SMITH What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  no more than that  --  no better than that  --  there 'd be no point in living . PHILO SMITH You are angry . LINDA EASTERBROOK No  --  not angry . I suppose Gay is everything you say  --  sentimental , romantic , even infantile . And yet not altogether  --  oh , I ca n't believe altogether . There are millions of anonymous people in the world  --  who ask only to be permitted to live  --  gentle , humble voices unheard and unrecorded  --  in them one must believe , for them one must do illogical and Quixotic things , for them one must  --  and I use the expression as a symbol  --  go to Spain and fight ! p. 154 PHILO SMITH You hate me . LINDA EASTERBROOK Philo ! PHILO SMITH Yes . You despise me . LINDA EASTERBROOK No  --  it 's that you are independent , you are secure  --  Gay , for all his absurd little faults  --  whatever he may be  --  Gay feels . He bleeds . You do n't bleed , Philo . I shall wait for Gay to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gay . PHILO SMITH ( After a moment , he is stunned and devastated . He moves to end of L. lounge and holds out his hand to her ) Yes  --  Well , goodbye , Linda . LINDA EASTERBROOK Goodbye , Philo . ( Takes his hand and looks at him . His eyes , for a moment , meet hers . Then PHILO turns , goes up to door and exits into hall ; closes door behind him . LINDA is left alone . She is deeply affected .
