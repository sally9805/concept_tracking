CHARITY BALL A STORY BY SELMA . ROBINSON W EN the music started , the light went out over the tables and drew itself into a square white patch on the dance floor . The faces of all the dancers turned into black and white masks , a little higher for the men , a little lower for the women . Shoulders were bare and blue-white in the light , and gowns were an indiscriminate black or gray . Laura watched the dancing couples , the white faces against dark shoulders , the white naked backs . Her sister and her brother-in-law sat sipping highballs , watching the dancers too . Far off past the dimly lighted tables , Laura thought she saw Jim Van Druten silhouetted . It could n't be he though . She had asked him to take her ; she had even bought the tickets for the Charity Ball on the chance that he might . But no . He was simply devastated but he was planning to do some fishing off South Carolina . Well , too bad . It would have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the crowds . But see you again some time . And when , a month before , she had asked him if he cared to see the Italian Marionettes he had to attend a house-party on the Shrewsbury . There was always somewhere else he had to be . For two delirious weeks he had been completely hers . No , not completely hers  --  Jim would never be that  --  but completely at her disposal . Theaters , night clubs , long dinners , and swift hurried spaces of breathlessness too shallow for rapture , painful as sword thrusts even to think about . Jim called her naive and was amused at first by her unrestrained outpouring of devotion ; he called her naive again at the end , but this time he was annoyed . He called her humorless too , and immature ( for all that she was twenty-nine and he twenty-six ) , and intense . Not in so many words , of course ; Jim was never crude . The many times she had called him ! But he was about to dash out on another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Nona leaned across the table and shouted above the music , " Whom are you frowning at , Laura ? " " Lend me your glasses , Nona . I think it 's someone I must see . " She adjusted the glasses . It was Jim . " It is . Will you excuse me ? I sha n't be long . Someone I must see . " Nona nodded . Tib rose as Laura rose and then he sat down . Laura picked her way among the tables like a cat , holding the black lace of her dress about her . She should n't go really . She should remember her pride , her dear little pride that she was always overlooking like a poor relation . But he might n't speak to her first ; he might n't even see her . And she had learned to be so gay and clever now . He would notice that . The tables held her back , like parasitic growths . " I beg your pardon , " she said as she wedged her way between them and the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ skirt , waiting for a chair here and there to be pushed back . In the mirrors along the walls , the dancers were reflected , shifting and white as waves , and the heads and the tables were dark shrubbery along the lake of light . He had said he would n't come , and there he was , beautiful as a tree , leaning against the door-jamb with the light illuminating his fine nose and chin . The fashion show was dismal . She was glad she had n't participated in it this year . The audience was worse : Seventh Avenue cloak-and-suiters probably . And all those silly young boys and girls . The two of them behind her . " You must meet my mother , " the boy with the teeth told the girl with the teeth ; " she 's a hell of a good egg . " And Nona and Tib dying in their chairs . Still it was nice of them to have come , the last minute and all . Well , anyway , the money went to charity , foundling babies @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made for love , " crooned the orchestra , and the feet shuff-shuffled to the banal music . Laura kept threading her way through the tables . Jim still leaned in a relaxed curve against the doorway , smoking , detached . " I beg your pardon , " Laura said to the tables , and " I beg your pardon . " " I 'm sorry . " " I beg your pardon . " " So sorry . " " May I pass ? " " I beg your pardon . " " Pardon . " " Pardon . " At the last of the little tables she held her head a little higher , set a careless little smile on her face . Jim turned around as she touched his arm . " Oh , good evening , Laura , " he said unsmilingly , his face white in the dance light reflected from the mirrors . " Jim ! So nice to see you here , " she said with a brisk wave of her hand , She withdrew a little into the shadow where the reflection @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fresh and young , so much younger than twenty-six really was . " Rare frock you 're wearing . You look no more than a schoolgirl in it , " he said . She thanked him prettily . Then , " Having a good time ? " he asked , turning his head away toward the dancers . Cold white light edged his face with steel . She was sorry she had come . His Lashes lay black on his cheek and opened upward like a fan . His eyes reflected the white light so that she could n't see them . They were like the marble eyes of statues ; they could n't see her either . If she turned now and walked away , he would n't know . " Simply marvelous , " she answered gayly , drawing her lipstick and vanity out of her bag . In the big round mirror slanting upward she could see his face , the almond-shaped pits that were his nostrils , the line of his jaw , the cheekbones painted with light . His eyes were not on her . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . If the glass broke he would vanish forever . She drew her mouth in lipstick , noting the drooping corners and the tragic frown between her eyes . " The night was made for love . " Were n't there any more words to that song ? She hummed it while she slapped the powder on . Her white cheeks and the black path of her eyebrows made her face a design of despair . She stopped humming for a moment . The need to be witty , to say the bright thing struck her  --  something arresting and piquant . " The fashion show was grand , do n't you think ? " she said , hearing her words as light as truckmen hob-nailed boots . He turned his face toward her . " I beg your pardon ? " he asked . " I said the fashion show was pretty terrible , was n't it ? " " Frightful . Dull things and clumsy women . Why were n't you among the mannequins , Laura ? Or are you deciding you 're a drate big diH , now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and offered her a cigarette . Then he took one himself . He lighted a match and made a little cave with his hands while he gave her a light and took one himself . It was intimate and warm in the cave . She felt alone with him there ; but presently he blew out the light . It was none of her business , but she said : " I did n't think you were coming here to-night . " " Neither did I , " he answered , smoking softly , " but such fun to find you here . " There was that about his voice which was toneless and bored , and so disinterested that she knew how futile it was to hope he had come there to see her , as she would have done gladly . She made a great business of smoking her cigarette , blowing rings , flicking ash . " What a mob , " she commented . " Tremendous , is n't it ? " And if she had said " What a small crowd " he would have responded @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Now she should go with the few splinters of pride that were still hers . There were no other words to say . You could n't say , " Jim , love me . " You could n't say , " Hate me , despise me , even , but let me see you occasionally . " So she said , " Here alone ? " Then she knew it was wrong to ask that , too . All her sick heart asked that , not her dumb brain . But there it was . Jim nodded his head yes , alone . " And you ? " he asked . She caught her breath in a sharp spasm of hope . She smiled . " Practically , " she said . " I 'm with my sister and brother-in-law , but they 're terribly bored , poor darlings . Besides , it 's past their bedtime and they want to go home . But I 'd like to stick around , I 'm having such a heavenly time . " She laid her fingers appealingly on his arm . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shyly , " if I sort of let them go home and hung around a while and danced a little and drank a little and had myself a marvelous time could I depend on a gallant gentleman like you to let me ride home next to him on the Fifth Avenue bus or the Madison Avenue trolley if it ever comes along ? " She waited as if on a cliff of ice for Jim to answer . Strong winds blew , the cliff was tall and slippery , the land strange and savage . His eyes met hers . " There 's nothing I 'd rather do , my angel , than take you home , " he said , insolently civil " But what 's a man to do ? " Cruel , cruel . She said , " Oh ! " She said , " You ca n't ? " " I 'm expecting a large and enthusiastic party . We 're leaving at once for Harlem , " he explained unnecessarily . " Too bad you wo n't join us . " She raised her hand in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you again must be getting back , " she said as if she were reading a formula . With exaggerated courtliness he kissed her hand . " Good night , pretty Laura . " " Good night , Jim . " Now there were all those tables and the crossed legs to overcome again before she got back . And that raw feeling inside her , beating like a wound . Where was her pride now and what good had she accomplished ? " Pardon me , " she told the stiff white bosom of a dress shirt . " Pardon me , " to the crossed silver slippers . " So sorry " to the tables , grown monstrous and clinging . " Pardon me , " " Pardon me , " " I 'm sorry , " " I beg your pardon . " The music slowed down and dragged out the final bars . " The  --  night -- was ? made  --  for  --  lo-o-ove . " The lights went on over the hall and the dancers applauded just as she reached her table . Tibbett rose and held @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , her black lace making a pool at her feet . " Just had to drop over to see someone , " she said . Nona inquired , " Was it a man ? " Laura nodded nonchalantly . " Why did n't you ask him over here ? " asked Nona . " He could n't stay . He 's going on to a night club . He asked me to go along . " " Why did n't you go , then ? " asked Nona . Laura drew herself up . " And leave you and Tib ? " she said , tenderly reproachful . FOREST POOL BY DAVID MORTON T HIS ' 0 heart , is the place , For this is dark and lonely , And silence is a grace Up un this spot , and only Rabbit and bird and deer , The shy , the comely ones , Will stand in the half-light , here , At the rise and set of suns . Take it out of your breast , And bury it here , and go . . . . On the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ alter and glow ; For sorrow turns like the leaf When a year and a day are told , So strange a thing is grief That alters from green to gold . And afterward , rabbit and bird And deer , in their going by , Will listen for no sound heard As evening pales in the sky , But cock their heads in their drinking , To gaze at a leaf in the pool , Being strangers to grief , but thinking golden and beautiful .
