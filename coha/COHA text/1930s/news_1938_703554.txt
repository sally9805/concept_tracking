txt Utility operations during the third quarter are likely to compare more favorably with the corresponding 1937 period than did results of the second quarter and the first half this year . Preliminary indications seem to point to third quarter net income for the industry within of the net reported for the 1937 third quarter . During the second quarter of this year utility net ? as measured by the results of major systems  --  fell behind 1937 by 15 , while the first quarter was around under the previous year . The first six months as a whole averaged around 12,4- behind a year ago . After running behind 1937 by more than 10% during the second quarter , electric power output picked up notably , following the close of June and averaged about under a year ago during July and August . Production figures for the week ended September 10. released yesterday , showed a further narrowing of the decrease from 1937 to compared with 7.4 , , in the preceding week . Weather in July and August was ideal for power companies The sultry days @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salutary effect on electric output . Business Turn Helps The somewhat better turn in business activity also contributed to the improvement in electric consumption for the third quarter to date . There had been considerable skepticism at first as to whether the imprOvement in demand for electricity which started in July also reflected the change for the better in the business tides . The feeling was that the hot and humid weather alone was responsible , and that the behavior of the output curve during a period of cool weather would first have to be observed to determine the influence the business pickup was having on electricity demand The opportunity for that observation was offered during the last week of August and first week in September . In both instances output maintained the approximate levels of the warmer weeks with the natural assumption being that the demand for industrial power by factories and either consumers was on the - up= grade . Operating results for the individual systems , of course . will vary widely . This will depend upon the capital set-up , and territory served . The thinner the equity @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ heavier the industrial load . the greater the decrease in net In the second quarter , for instance , the systems that reported showed results compared with 1937 ranging from a moderate increase to a loss of more than 50 ' , r . Production Peak Production of electricity reached its highest weekly volume thus far this year in the seven days ended September 10 , with a total of 2,154 , - 276.000 kwh . The peak for all of 1937 was reached in the corresponding week . Last year output declined steadily from the September 4 week , reaching its lowest level during the week of June 4 of this year with production of 1. - 878,831.000 kwh . If there is real foundation to the recent betterment in business , then the electric production curve during the remainder of this year should follow a course just the reverse of last year 's performance . If that should eventuate , then weekly electric production should cross the 2.200,000,000 figure before the end of the year . Such a development in turn would again bring to the fore the question @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet further expansion . Towi years ago when output was on the upgrade the utility industry was charged repeatedly by various governmental representatives with being unprepared for any fair expansion in demand for energy . The industry 's refutation of such charges was substantiated last year when It handled comfortably a peak week of 2.320. - 000,000 kwh Since 1935. when doubts about the adequacy of the industry 's generating capacity first began to be expressed , there has been more than 1.700 , - 000 kilowatts of generating capacity added . Of that total more than 700.000 has been added since the first of this year . The exact figures show the industry added in the first eight months of 1938 731.000 kwh. and retired 79,000 kw , leaving a net gain of 675,000 kw of generating capacity . With the additional equipment added this year to date , the industry is now estimated to have generating facilities capable of handling 2,500,000,000 kwh. weekly .
