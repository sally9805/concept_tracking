txt General ATTERBURY is the latest prominent Republican to take up his parable against the Hawley-Smoot tariff . To be sure , he did not mention that sacred document by name , but spoke emphatically about the folly of building tariff walls which " tend to separate the different coun " tries into hermetically sealed coin ' " partments so far as commerce is " concerned . " Even more- emphatically he asserted that , of all countries in the world , the United States ' should be the last to fall back upon the complacent assumption that it is wholly " seg-contained , " and has no need of exchanging , products with . other nations . Indeed , General ATTERBURY , who was discussing the business outlook , had no hesitation in declaring that " impediments to " international trade are one of the " greatest obstacles in the way of " commercial recovery . " Such an utterance from a powerful Pennsylvania Republican ought to be cut out and sent to the two United - . States Senators from that State , ' with the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reference . Other influential Republicans have expressed horrid doubts about the . wisdom of the tariff which their party put through Congress and which their President signed . Even a man like Representative SNELL , prominent in the - House , and now a candidate for Speaker in the next Congress , has intimated that if he Iliad to do it over again he would - not vote for the high rates of the  - -  existing tariff law . Almost one is tempted to say that it has not a single friend left . That would be , however , to overlook that most stern - and unbending of all high-tariff men , Senator SMOOT . In the midst of the ' chorus of disapproval of the bill which he had so much to do with framing , his voice is again heard in ra brief strain of unpremeditated ' praise . His main argument is that , ' bad as has been the prolonged de  --  pression which the protective tariff was guaranteed at once to cure , things would have been much worse ' in this country had not the customs duties on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our unfortunate shores , thus making our last estate worse than the first . Apparently , he seems to think that Europeans would have given away their products in this country and not bought anything of us in return : But without dwelling on this delightful old protectionist fiction it is enough for present purposes to record the fact that Senator SMOOT 'S heart is still true to the tariff . Though it slay him and ruin his party , yet will he trust it . Of one anxiety confessed by General ATTERBURY he ought to feel relieved . He feared that the public debt had been decreased too rapidly . The question he.asked was whether we might not wisely defer somewhat more of the reduction " to another : generation . " Do n't be troubled , Gen'eral , we are already doing it . Instead ' - of lowering the public debt we are now cheerfully increasing it . Ask Secretary MELLON about the short-term Government obligations that are being piled up as a charge on ' the Treasury to meet the huge 1 deficit caused by Republican legis ' @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rWhich the Republican party stands ready to confer upon the country , if kept in power , Is pretty certain to be included what used to be called the blessing of a huge national debt .
