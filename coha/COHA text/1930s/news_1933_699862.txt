txt As gauged here the Administration viewpoint is likely to be opposed to the determination of railroad executives to propose a further reduction of 121,4% in rail wanes . No comment was forthcoming from the White House on this score but the informed impression here was that the President may not countenance the wage cut move . This view is supported by the known attitude of the President in insisting on railroad labor safeguards in the emergency railroad bill in the face of objections of Chairman Rayburn of the House interstate commerce committee and Joseph B. Eastman of the Interstate Commerce Commission . This prospect is further supported by the intervention of the Secretary of Labor in the anthracite wage negotiations some weeks ago where operators were seeking to effect a reduction in anthracite mine wage scale . Proposal Counters Legislation The fact that the railroad move runs , counter to one of the main factors of the industry control bill also supports this prospect . One of the prime objectives of this new legislation is to raise wages . The influence of railroad labor with Congress and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ over the period of consideration and enactment of the President 's emergency railroad bill . Virtually every concession insisted upon by the rail unions was granted . That the standard railroad labor organizations will unqualifiedly reject the proposal is clearly foreshadowed . In recent meeting here the Association of Railway Labor Executives flatly rejected and vigorously attacked all railroad proposals for a wage reduction . An additional 122A% cut from the basic rate of railroad wages will be sought by the carriers . Notices will be seat to the four principal trotherhoods today . Notices will be sent to other classes of labor at a later date . The 22V- % , reduction from the basic rate amounts to between $250,000,000 and $300,000 , - 000 on an annual basis . 10% Cut Expires November 1 The railroads have had a 10% reduction in effect since February 1 . 1931 . This cut expires November 1 . When the 10% cut was extended from February 1 last , the agreement provided that neither side could seek a change until June 15 and that no change could take place until the end @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ roads left New York yesterday afternoon for Chicago . where railroad executives plan to hold a session to discuss wage matters today . The railroads will proceed under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act . Under this long and drawn out procedure , following the posting of notices , representatives of the carriers and the brotherhoods will hold conferences in hope of settling the matter amicably . If this fails , which it very probably will , the " good offices " of the United States Board of Mediation will be invoked . If the Federal Mediator is unable to bring about a settlement he will then strive to have both parties agree to have the question arbitrated . Can Refuse to Arbitrate The brotherhoods can refuse to arbitrate but it is unlikely that they will in view of the sharp public criticism that would fall upon them under , circumstances . The roads are sorely in need of the pay cut . In some quarters it is argued that they waited too long to seek a permanent reduction which would have brought rail pay in line with that of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cost of living . The reas2s2 that they did not proceed in the past was that President Hoover asked them to defer action before the last election . Under the present circumstances the roads are seeking the reduction while traffic is increasing and while other industries are increasing pay . True the other industries cut from 25% to 50% and the increases they are now giving are only a small proportion of this . However , the fact that they are now increasing pay while the railroads are trying to have it lowered is damaging to the carriers ' case Thearbitration proceedings are likely to extend into next year . It is probable that if the negotiations are still underway at the expiration of the present contract on November 1 that another temporary agreement will have to be reached pending the outcome of the arbitration proceedings . Otherwise the basic rate would go back into effect on November 1 . Probably the Bangor &; Aroostook , Delaware &; Hudson , Western Maryland and possibly the Gulf , Mobile SC Northern will not take part in the national negotiations .
