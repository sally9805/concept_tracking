One of the unbarbed items in Pins &; Needles , the revue produced by the International Ladies ' Garment Workers ' Union , is a wistful number called Sunday in the Park , depicting the tribulations of the proletariat when it deserts New York 's teeming streets for its teeming parks . A man who enjoys such simple proletarian pleasures is former Garment-Cutter David Dubinsky , president of I.L.G.W.U. Unlike many labor leaders , he would rather ride on a bicycle than bet on a bicycle race . Palm Sunday , stocky little President Dubinsky , attired in a leather windbreaker , was pedaling through New York 's Central Park on the elegant English bicycle given him last year by his Lingerie Workers local . There Labor Leader Dubinsky chanced to meet his ubiquitous old friend , Labor Reporter Louis Stark of the New York Times , who was spending Sunday in the park on foot . What followed while Sunday dinner waited must have been a busman 's holiday because next day from Washington , on the eve of a meeting of the Committee for Industrial Organization @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if it decided to call a convention to form a permanent organization . <P> Promptly , President Dubinsky labeled such reports " absolutely untrue . " But his old friend Louis Stark did not mind and Mr. Stark 's old friends knew better . Ever since Mr. Dubinsky accused John L. Lewis of responsibility for the breakdown of A. F. of L.-C.I.O. peace negotiations last December , relations between I.L.G.W.U. and C.I.O. have been becoming increasingly unfriendly . What many labor leaders resent is the disruption of the hundreds of local labor councils in which A. F. of L. and C.I.O. unionists can work together effectively , but which a complete breach between the two national organizations makes increasingly difficult . Last week former C.I.O. enthusiast Dubinsky stayed away from the C.I.O. meeting , sent instead Julius Hochman , poet , dilettante and hard-boiled manager of the New York Dressmakers ' Joint Board . <P> When C.I.O. voted , with Mr. Hochman abstaining , to call a constitutional convention this fall to form a permanent organization , President Dubinsky became less categorical : " The decision . . . creates a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has neither in its structure nor in its ultimate objectives been designed to be a permanent competitive organization in the American trade union field . . . . The question of our participation in such a convention or of joining such a new organization will be taken up and decided upon by our General Executive Board . .. late in May . " <P> Loss to C.I.O. of I.L.G.W.U. , second largest of the original C.I.O. unions , will mean loss of one of the most progressive , most solvent , most ably led industrial unions in the country . Whether the garment workers remain independent or return to a gleeful A. F. of L. remains to be worked out . <P> The committee which is the Committee for Industrial Organization consists of the heads of the 39 new and old national and international unions affiliated with C.I.O. It is this committee , presided over by John L. Lewis , which met last week in closed sessions.
