txt It is always a aengnu to near from HENRY O'MALLEY , Commissioner of Fisheries . He has charge of the fish that live in coastal waters , and of their even more venturesome brethren who swim up the streams " anadromous " fishes , as they are called . He tags the cod , guards the oysters , follows the salmon in their wanderings , does obeisance to the whales . He supervises the domestic relations of the seals on the Pribilof Islands , and sells their skins . He rescues stranded fish in the Mississippi  --  a most humane endeavor , very necessary in times of drought . He does his best to lessen the interval , between bites that Fisherman HOOVER likes to talk about . And every year about this time he renders an account of his stewardship . His report for the last fiscal year is full of the usual spacious statistics . When Mr. O'MALLEY begins to count the eggs put out by one of his hatcheries , only astronomers and reparation experts can follow him . A shad roe from the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off which CLEVELAND ate , is ' no less palatable to the poor ignoramus who does n't know how many eggs it contains than to the all-wise Mr. O'MALLEY himself.1 But one must forgive him his rolling I statistics ; he works for a boss who makes three . hearty meals off such figures every day , and who , when he was himself Secretary of Commerce , used to send college boys up to Alaska to count the salmon as they passed upstream . The seal herds are thriving , the ladies will be glad to know , and now number over a million animals  --  a living memorial to the advantages of conservation and the effectiveness of international action . It was the halibut 's turn this year . Hippoglossus had a treaty arranged between Canada and the United States , all for his benefit . It clamps down a close season , even on the high seas , from November to February every year . What other device would be effective ?

" The whale should be next in line for protection by international action . At one time the United States led all the nations in this fishery . It is still a large consumer of whaleoil  --  by no means a despised product even in these days of electric light . But nowadays the great floating factories do the business , and do it in a wholesale way , the mother ship relying on the smaller " killers " to scour the seas and tow in the catch . The world catch of whales has increased from 12,000 in 1920 to more than 27,500 in 1929 . These figures mean something even to the layman , who can picture what a mountain 27,500 whales would make . Mr. O'MALLEY is gravely concerned about this fishery . He wants the nations of the world to do something about the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
