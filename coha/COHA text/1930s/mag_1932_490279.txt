WE have an idea for stopping the war in the Orient . It is : take it off the front pages and put it on Page 2 . It has never been worth front-page space , and the only reason China and Japan have had the strength to go on fighting and writing ultimata is that they have had such a good press . They have had wonderful notices right from the start . The war has become known already as the Sino-Japanese , or Floyd Gibbons , war , and every ultimatum has been given a double-column front-page box For his papers Mr. Gibbons has viewed the conflict from rowboats , motorcycles , rickshaws , bathroom windows , destroyers , and skis ; and he has infused it with the same tension that he gave Byrd 's flight over the South Pole when they had to drop the food bags in order to clear the mountain top . Will you ever forget the dropping of those fond bags ? It 's the same way in the East now . Every day a food bag , or in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplane ( flown by a pilot who learned aviation out of a book ) and it generally lands right at Mr. Gibbons ' feet , as luck would have it . Then we get another banner headline : " GIBBONS PENETRATES FRONT LINES IN FLIMSY TRICYCLE ; Sees China Repulsed by Jap Horde . " Why , a hundred years ago , when it used to take sailing vessels four months to come around by way of the Strait of Magellan , we would n't even have heard of the war yet , and Mr. Gibbons would still be trying to get through the Strait of Magellan in a rowboat . By the time he got to the Orient , the war would be over , all the food bags would have been dropped , and nobody here would be the wiser . As they are n't today . SPEAKING of war correspondence , we notice that the iimerican is running a series of articles on " the thrilling life story of Floyd Gibbons , the famous war correspondent . " Thus , while Mr. Gibbons is describing the war , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pretty inbred the sort of thing that causes the deterioration of pigeons . The articles about Floyd arc by Henry Wales . They tell how he has followed trouble all over the world ( not a troublemaker , but a trouble-follower ) , How he drove across France and Germany in an old car to cover the Kapp Putsch ; how he was in Riga when the Volga famine broke out ; how he made weekend dashes to Ireland to see how trouble was getting along there in Sinn Fein days ; how he scooped the world with a series on Russia ; and how in Rome he tried to rescue a famous movie star from a runaway horse , because there is no trouble , after all , like a runaway horse . Mr. Wales describes Mr. Gibbons every bit as vividly as 14r . Gibbons describes the war . What we want now is a series on Mr. Henry Wales , famous biographer of war correspondents  --  to run simultaneously with the Gibbons series , and the Sino-Jap series . T 0 revert to our recent triumph -- getting the colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ may say that we are still not satisfied with the appearance of the heavenly peak . Not by a good deal . The white lights are certainly better than the colored ones , but the tower by night is still a meaningless strap of incandescence  --  brash and silly . The way to illuminate a tower ( and there is always the alternative of simply leaving it dark ) is the way the H ecksc he r Building tower is lighted . A soft flood of light is thrown up indirectly at the tower , burnishing the wingtips of the gold cock , who looks like a barnyard fowl taking a stroll in t ie moonlight . The effect is amusing , and good . We call it to the attention of Governor Smith , and ask him to give the matter his further thought . If he does n't know where the Heckscher Building is , we 'll be glad to take him there . THE new double-action traffic lights on the Avenue are the result of the Police Department 's excursion into Surr6alisme . To taxi-drivers schooled in chaos @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both up-and-down and crosstown traffic is simply a bit of police fantasia in which the Department is gropingly trying to express its dreamy ideology . Red , once a warning , has now become the signal for the attack . Of course , the waiting traffic is not supposed to be able to see the red that halts the moving traffic ; but the drivers peek . All drivers peek . On the other hand , the moving traffic is not supposed to know that the waiting traffic has n't been released yet ; but they peek too , and scuttle across . Thus the two armies meet , just as they have always met , on the field of honor . Things were really more orderly at the intersections in the old days when there was a moment of no light at all between signals . Something about the absence of light gave drivers pause : they ventured timorously , as into a dark room . But red-all-around is the joyous call to action , and the troops respond with the glad clash of fender and the shrill trumpet of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bus the other day during the late-afternoon rush hour , and succeeded in getting the last empty seat . Ten minutes later , she came stomping out to the platform again . " I 'm getting off right here and now , " she announced . " I can walk faster than this . And furthermore , " she added , " I want my ten cents back . If you think I 'm going to pay good money for this kind of service , you 're very much mistaken . " The conductor protested feebly , trying to explain that he could n't refund fares , and the lady was just taking a deep breath , preparing to annihilate him completely , when another lady started to climb aboard the bus . " No seats , " the conductor began . " Just a moment , " the first lady interrupted . " Madam , I was going to get off here , but this man refuses to refund my fare . If you will give me ten cents , you can have my seat . You wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to the conductor , giving him a look . The conductor , thoroughly intimidated , shook his head meekly . The two ladies effected their little transaction , and the first one , with triumphant glances , descended to the curb . The conductor , sighing gently , rang his signal to go ahead . Dovecot GENEVA IS a boom town for the Disarmament Conference , one of our corps of trained internationalists reports , and the Genevese are all going about with happy smiles . Hotel men have been taking in eight thousand dollars a day from those meeting in the sacred cause of amity ; the cabarets are staying open hours later than usual ; the local Miinchner dispensary , the Bavaria , has been so renovated that elder inhabitants scarcely recognize it ; and streetcars to the League headquarters have been put on a five-minute schedule . There are even postage stamps , with doves on them , for the convenience of the delegates . Nothing , in fact , was left undone for the convenience and comfort of those gathered to sheathe the sword . Our internationalist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ reached Geneva . She drove to a pension in the Rue Massot , where she used to lodge when in Geneva , and was surprised to discover : first , that many motors were drawn up before it ; second , that the old management was gone ; and , third , that it was much brighter and gayer than she had remembered it . They would n't let her in . The new lady in charge was a little evasive , but made it clear that there was no room at the moment , and moreover would n't be as long as the peace conference lasted . Our internationalist , remarking later on her experience , learned that the new lady in charge was from Paris , as well as many young lady friends with her , and had been brought from Paris especially . They were , in a word , among the conveniences especially provided to serve the gathered idealists . The lady had been approached by a group of Geneva 's boosters during the days of preparation and talked into coming . The importation was necessary because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , had made such a deep impression on Geneva that it had actually pretty well cleaned itself up . That dismal fact occurred to the boosters about the time the Bavaria was repainted and even before the stamps , with the doves on them , were made available . Some trouble was experienced g e tt in g Madame and her little friends in , the whole matter , in view of passport regulations and the like , being rather delicate . It is our duty to report that things did not work out quite as planned . Amity broke down somehow . A police agent disguised as a flower girl , of all things , got into the place and discovered what was going on . Then some more police , not disguised at all , went in and pinched it . The lady from Paris was righteously expelled . Remainder REMEMBER the dear old Wick- " Ns ersham report , which cleared up that matter of prohibition ? We Caine across a reference to it the other day while browsing through the " Annual Report of the Public Printer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a document with which we have passed several dull hours since it came into our possession . The report was referred to as the " official records of the National Commission on Law Observance and Enforcement , Senate Document No. 3117 , " but we recognized it after a time . We learned that it filled 2,916 printed pages , which made five volumes , and that the regular free congressional trade had absorbed 1,923 sets . The most touching sentence in the printer 's report was the last one . It read : " The Superintendent of Documents ordered 300 sets for sale at $6.75 per set but none has been sold as yet . " If we were the Superintendent of Documents we Cigar Stores . Flag Stop IN our generous way , we offer the following anecdote CO the nonchalant Murad people . It is about a New Yorker who was in Monroe , 11 , lichigan , for reasons of little importance , and wanted to get back to New York as quickly as possible . He learned that , if you spoke to the Monroe stationmaster @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a flyer the Pennsylvania is very proud of . He spoke to the stationmaster and the stationmaster went out and waved his flag at the Red Arrow . The Red Arrow , to everybody 's surprise , kept on flying . Nobody had ever seen it go by so fast . They all looked after it , rather hurt . About a mile down the track , it surprised them again and did stop . Then it slowly , reluctantly , backed to Monroe , with people standing in all the Pullman doors and looking annoyed . Mostly they were railroad people , all of whom seemed to he looking at watches . They let the New York man on . Then they told him , with some emphasis , that the Red Arrow was engaged on a test run from Detroit to New York , with a mail contract or something else important involved . The New Yorker says if ever a man needed nonchalance , he did then . He was without a Murad , however , and he just went and hid . Humble pARTIES striving for an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ black pot , " which is just an old bean pot full of baked beans . It comes from the family-style kitchen on the nineteenth floor , and when it is brought into a room the waiters flutter about . Sometimes the Waldorf even sends the bean pot abroad through the city . Mrs. M. L. Schwartz , of 730 Park Avenue , put in a call for it the other night and it was taken to her place by two waiters in a taxi . Mr. Rene Black , maitre d'hael , went along to stir . We have learned the secret of the beans , incidentally , in case anyone wants to try it : Mexican kidney beans are soaked overnight in water , add one pig 's foot and one calf 's foot , fill the pot with claret , add a sachet bag containing laurel leaf , thyme , rosemary , scallions , and a whole white onion studded with cloves . Then the entire thing is placed in a baker 's oven and kept in a slow fire for from twelve to fourteen hours . Wait @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must be added , and a pint of cooked coffee , one bottle of beer , and a cupful of olive oil . Just be fore the beans are served , a glass of brandy is added . Mr. Black says that the coffee cuts the grease and the brandy binds together the flavor of the beans and the other ingredients . He got the recipe from a cook on the island of Martinique , where time hangs heavy on everybody 's hands . Besides beans the hotel gets innumerable calls for corned beef and cabbage , flannel cakes , chicken with dumplings , boiled beef with vegetables , and fish-cakes . HE Waldorf called up Bellevue the other day ( hotels often do this ) to tell them they had some flowers the hospital might have . Left from a party and still fresh . " Who 's this ? " said Bellevue . " The Waldorf-Astoria . If you call , we 'll give you some flowers . " " Hotel Waldorf ? " said the voice . " O.K. What 's the address ? " Risky ADISTINGUISHED scientist @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ has been sojourning quietly in New York , we learn from a gentleman who attended a lunch given for the visitor in a somnolent club . That was a week or so ago . There were twenty guests , most of them scientists or persons interested in science . Among them was our old friend Charles Lindbergh , the aviator . After coffee , various groups stood about chatting and Lindbergh joined the Berlin man and two or three others . In the course of the mild conversation , the German scientist remarked that he was going to Washington at the end of the week . " I am going to Washington at that time myself , " said Lindbergh , " and I should be glad to fly you down . " The German declined politely , but elaborately . He was n't certain when he was going , would n't think of troubling anyone , and so on . Shortly afterward , the Colonel took his leave and the German explained to another man that he enjoyed flying , but he had one rule about it : he would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dangerous . He rode only with tried professional pilots . " I hated to refuse the young man , though , " he said , " he was so kind and amiable . What was his name ? " Jungle ANYONANYONE who wants actually to see E creaking will do well to visit the corner of Wrest and Spring Streets and look at what is going on there . The subway fare is only five cents , whereas a trip to the Congo costs a thousand dollars . There is a whole village of shacks and huts there , made of packing boxes , barrel staves , pieces of corrugated iron , and whatever else the junkman does n't want , and the people who live there do so because the Ncw York Central has n't got around to driving them off . They eat what they can get and wear what they can find . Population : 150 , heavily Negro . Percentage of usefully employed : 0 . Total wealth : $0.00 . Something like two years ago , the New York Central tore down several blocks of houses @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Into the chaos of debris came two enterprising men from Harlem and built themselves a cabin out of a piece of oilcloth , a sec tion of a broken billboard , half a gasoline drum , and sonic cellar doors . They installed an abandoned stove , threw some burlap bags over an old bedspring , and moved in . They were the founders of Jungletown . As you approach the place , you see an area which looks like the dun ruhbish flats of Newark , but presently figures are discerned moving about and as you get to it the smoke which might easily be a sign of smoldering garbage becomes the symbol of home . Stovepipes , roofs , houses come into focus . Faces peer out , black , poor-white , mongrel . Examination shows many of the houses to be quite snug , large enough to hold two cots , a chair , a table , and a stove . There is color in Jungletown , the natural gaudy brilliance of selected rubbish , close up . One wall will show galvanized iron , dry-goods cases hearing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , while the opposite one will exhibit a valuable collection of automobile floorboards set off by a piece of old red barn . " Can you beat it ? " asked the automobile-service man whose station adjoins Jungletown . " There 's radios in some of those huts , and there are three Swedish sailors with a pho nograph . Somebody gave it to ' em . " Walk through the place and enter into conversation . News will he varied , colorful , and unreliable . There are no women . There 's a Spanish War veteran . There were two Chinese but they left . There are some boys of fourteen . Last Thursday a butcher 's boy drove up and left a tub of pigs tails . On Thursday , also , the police came and took two villagers away for robbing a garage . " It might be worse , " says one inhabitant . " I 've got my own house and that 's more than I ever had before . The big trouble is the noise . " And what noise ! The roar and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ earth . Day and night one colossal truck follows another in never-ending procession . Rattle , crash , bang ! ? music boxes , caviar , dog collars , gold , roaring uptown in a fog of gasoline fumes .

WE 'VE known , of course , that the V hatters felt pretty badly about the fad of going without hats and we 've suspected they were probably taking steps . It was n't until the other day , however , that we learned what the steps are . We were walking in the little hatters ' colony east of ' Washington Square and discovered that all the hatters had filled their windows with new and exciting placards . " Hatless Today , Sinus Trouble Tomorrow , " one of the placards threatened , with a picture of four young men with no hats and a lot of sinus . " If Your Hatter Do n't Get You , Your Doctor Must , " another said , a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Do n't Be Effeminate " and went on : " Let 's Be Frank About This ! Who Goes Hatless ? Not the Doctor . Not the Lawyer . Not the Businessman . Who , Then ? Look Around You ! " There was a picture at the top to make it clear what they meant . We looked around us , dutifully . Saw a lot of N.Y.U. students without hats , the Washington Square branch of the university being across the street . They seemed to be getting along all right , though . No sinus to speak of ; no unusual amount of effeminacy . Bandmaster VOUSSEVITZKY , here this coming week with the Boston Symphony , has his clothes made with great care . When you flail your arms around before an audience you have to feel sure that your coat collar wo n't hike up and your sleeves look funny . Koussevitzky is probably the best-dressed of the eminent conductors , unless it 's S to kowski . ( Toscanini does n't worry about such things . ) They say that Koussevitzky practices with a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have grown out of his antics as a boy in Russia , when he would arrange chairs in a room , bow to them , conduct them , berate them , with the score of some symphony open in front of him . He would sing different parts of the score as he conducted the surprised chairs . When he was in his twenties he married the daughter of a wealthy Moscow merchant , who promised him anything he wanted as a wedding gift . Koussevitzky said he wanted a symphony orchestra , and although taken aback for a moment , his father-in-law kept his promise ; he got together the foremost musicians of Moscow and Konsscvitzky assembled his orchestra . The orchestra made him famous . For seven years he took it on tour , giving free concerts , sometimes in small towns along the Volga whose inhabitants had never heard an orchestra before . On these river trips the orchestra travelled by special steamer , another gift to the conductor from his wife 's father . Koussevitzky did n't just leap from chair-conducting to orchestra-leading . He had studied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bit on the double bass in orchestras . Now he is the only living virtuoso on the double bass . He has n't given a public recital in two years , but every year on his birthday he gives a concert to his intimate friends in his Paris home . He is always looking for new composers and has discovered or championed a dozen or more young Americans . In the season 1930-31 his orchestra played nine works for the first time anywhere ( including two by Americans ) and ten for the first time in Boston . He will listen to the first playing of something modern , perhaps by a group of chamber-music amateurs , and sccm uninterested throughout . When it is finished he often takes the score and criticizes the interpretation of it in detail , as if he had known it for years . One of his recreations is taking long morning walks with his Boston terrier , named Droll . This has gone on for seven years . Some say that on these walks he Tongs for Paris ( the only place in which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established there and making quite a stir when an offer of fifty thousand a year lured him to Boston . He has his own music-publishing house in the French capital with an advisory board of five prominent composers .
