The New York State Athletic Commission started something last fortnight which may move boxing westward from the eastern seaboard . Dogmatic and irascible Big Jim Farley , chairman , started the Commission . The Commission had given Max Schmeling his tit 's when Sharkey fouled him last June , stipulating then that he must sign within nine months to meet an opponent picked by them . They picked Jack Sharkey , ordered Schmeling , through his manager and proxy , Joe Jacobs , to sign with Sharkey at once or forfeit his title . Jacobs suggested that the Commission arrange for Sharkey to fight Stribling , the winner to meet Schmeling . Both fights , if the Commission consented , would have been staged in New York . Standing on his dignity , Big Jim Farley rejected these fights , revoked Schmeling 's title as heavyweight champion of the world . <P> Immediately eastern promoters became sensitive to danger . This was the chance western promoters had been waiting . Schmeling was still champion outside of New York . Why not a title bout in Chicago ? Sidney @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it but could not close the deal . Chicago has no other promoters above the level of John ( " Mique " ) Malloy and James C. Mullen , with whom no important fighters now do business . Outmaneuvering Strotz , President Carey of Manhattan 's Madison Square Garden Corp . quickly revived the Garden 's Illinois subsidiary which Tex Rickard had used in 1927 . A bill to legalize bouts of more than ten rounds in Illinois was drawn and rushed to Governor Emmerson for approval before being submitted to the State legislature . And Madison Square Garden Corp . of Illinois signed up two bouts tentatively : Schmeling v. Stribling in Chicago in June ; the winner v. Primo Camera in Jersey City in September . Camera , like Schmeling , is under ban in New York . <P> Sharkey v. Dempsey . Jack Dempsey , in an article in The Ring , rated Stribling and Schmeling ahead of Sharkey . Furious , Sharkey issued a trick challenge to Dempsey for a fight " within six weeks . " Said Dempsey : " In reply to ' What Is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jack Sharkey of Boston . "
