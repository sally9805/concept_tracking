Stretching for six blocks along Chicago 's West Side are the seven dirty red brick buildings and the one clean yellow brick building of " Misery Harbor " ( Cook County Hospital ) - largest general hospital in the world . Through the gates of the hospital pour 135,000 charity patients every year , for everything from athlete 's foot treatment to blood transfusions. * During the last four years Cook County Hospital has been a battleground for two warring medical factions . Last week a compromise ended the fight . <P> Medical Superintendent of the huge plant for 25 years was Dr. Karl Albert Meyer . A practical old-school surgeon , Dr. Meyer never required the hospital 's army of interns to attend postgraduate classes or lectures , insisted that all young doctors fresh from college needed was " a heavy dose of experience . " But the American Medical Association , whose headquarters is Chicago , believes that all interns should taper off into actual practice with at least 80 hours of medical lectures during internship . Over this point Cook County 's Dr. Meyer and A.M.A. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ often . Dr. Meyer budged not a scalpel 's length . Consequently , four years ago , the A.M.A. dropped Cook County from its list of approved hospitals , thus automatically cutting off Dr. Meyer 's supply of interns from topflight medical schools . <P> A further irritation to Dr. Cutter &; friends was Dr. Meyer 's associate , Warden Manus McCloskey , no doctor but a retired brigadier-general of the U. S. Army , appointed to hospital post by the Board of Cook County Commissioners . <P> Since the dropping of Cook County from the approved hospital list produced no effect on stubborn Dr. Meyer , A.M.A. last spring brought public opinion to bear . An A.M.A.-inspired citizens ' committee , investigating management of the hospital , recommended that Dr. Meyer be ousted , hinted that the hospital might be reinstated on the A.M.A. 's list if a new director acceptable to the A.M.A. , were chosen . The County Commissioners backed Dr. Meyer , stood pat . <P> But last week they finally changed their minds , paid both sides off . Terms : 1 ) Dr. Meyer was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all county institutions " ; 2 ) Cook County was promised reinstatement on the A.M.A. 's list sometime around Jan. 1 ; 3 ) Surgeon Charles Marshall Davison , son of a former Cook County Hospital surgical chief , warm friend of Dr. Meyer and of A.M.A. propriety as well , was appointed new Cook County director ; 4 ) five medical aides-de-camp were assigned to Dr. Davison . General McCloskey will continue to run only the mechanical departments of the hospital . <P> Tactful , 43-year-old Dr. Davison hopes to turn the compromise between the hospital and the A.M.A. into a lasting peace . Chicagoans , weary of squabbles and political scandal , hoped that he would plump for a bigger appropriation to buy more bedpans , provide more ward space , keep beds out of corridors , put up a new building to relieve overcrowding . <P> <P> * In 1937 Cook County set up the first blood bank in the U. S.
