txt Police Commissioner Lewis J. Valentine , embittered at the line-up yesterday by the nonchalance of a homicide suspect whom he described as " a paid assassin , " instructed 200 detectives assembled in the room to rid the city of that type . He told them to " muss ' em up , " " make it disagreeable for them , " " teach them to fear arrest " and " shoot accurately " when they encounter them . Sharply etched against the white wall on the line-up platform stood Harry Strauss , a lean , narrow-eyed prisoner . 25 years old , arrested in connection with the murder of Alvin Sydnor , a garage attendant . Prisoner Jaunty in Line-Up . Strauss bore an easy pose in his smartly cut Chesterfield overcoat with velvet collar . His blue suit was pressed to razor sharpness and a new blue shirt , held fast by a tie to match , was snug around his neck . A new pearl-gray fedora was I ( canted over one eye at a jaunty angle .

" Calls Suspect an Example . He turned slowly toward the dapper figure on the platform and his voice grated . " This man , " he said , " is a pal of Abe Reles 's , who is now in the penitentiary. ** was accused or the murder of Sydnor , but the indictment was dismissed because of insufficient evidence . " You men the assembled detectives are handicapped when you face men like this . When you meet such men draw quickly and shoot accurately .

Blood should be smeared all over his velvet collar . Instead , he looks as though he just came out of the barber shop . " Strauss 's figure had stiffened during this speech . He shifted uneasily from one foot to the other and his eyes sought the ceiling . Once or twice he tugged nervously at the brim of his new hat . " You men will be supported by me no matter what you do , if what you do is justified , " the . commissioner continued . " Make it disagreeable for these men . Drive them out of the city . Teach them to fear arrest . Make them fear you . " Do n't treat them lightly . And take this message back to your as- sociates .

Dodge , when informed later in the day that Mr. Valentine had promised the police they would be pro , tected by him and by the District Attorney if they handled gunmen roughly , with justification , said he had no understanding with Mr. Valentine to that effect . Back in his own office , after the line-up , the commissioner supplemented his earlier remarks in an interview with newspaper men . " It 's about time , " he said , " that the men received some assurance of support . The sooner we get rid of the gangster , the better . I am going to support the men .

" We want to be careful not to kill innocent people and we do n't want to use brutality on others because of different political faiths , but with the killers , racketeers and gangsters  --  the sky is the limit . " When he finished , his face was flushed with anger . Strauss , although only 25 years old , has been arrested eighteen times  --  three times on homicide charges , six times on charges of carrying a revolver , on larceny , as ' sault and narcotic charges  --  but has never been convicted . He lives at 834 Saratoga Avenue in the Brownsville district of Brooklyn and , according to the detectives , was an associate of Abe Reles , small-time Brownsville thug , who boasted before Judge Martin in Brooklyn last month that he would " shoot it out with any cop , with pistols or anything else , " before he was sent to the penitentiary .
