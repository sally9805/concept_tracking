txt Greetings from President Hoover , a speech by Ambassador Sackett and an , international radio hook-up during a banquet were the features of today 's proceedings at the second World Power Conference . Four thousand persons sat down to dinner this evening at the Sport , Palace , Berlin 's Madison Square Garden , and heard seven brief talks from loudspeakers , for only two of which the guests could see the speakers . The voices of the other five , Matthew S. Sloan , Lord Derby , Owen D. Young , Senator Guglielmo Marconi and Thomas A. Edison , came over a combination telephone and radio hook-up from San Francisco , West Orange , N. J. , and London . Audibility was excellent , though the fact that the supply of loudspeakers was somewhat limited prevented those at a distance from hearing properly , which led to an outbreak of murmuring and conversation , and it was scarcely possible to hear Mr. Edison 's words for the sounds of eating and talking . However , Sannosuke Inada , director of communications of Tokyo , was ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ enthusiastic over the feat and the essential clarity of the voices . At the " American hour " at 5 P. M. , Ambassador Sackett read the following message from President Hoover : " Imagination is stirred by the everwidening field of knowledge and its practical application in multiplying instruments of service to mankind . Civilized society depends tt , an everincreasing degree upon the spirit of inquiry and the utilization of scientific truth . Those who serve this cause serve best the interests of the race . " H. Foster Bain , secretary of the American Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineers , spoke on " The Place of Minerals in a PowerControlled World , " tracing the importance of power to civilization . He said the supplies of power sources were ample and new sources would be made available as soon as the present materials threatened to become exhausted . Details of the Hook-Up . Scientists and engineers in three countries , the United States , England and Germany , conferred yester- day over what is said to have been the most widespread and far-reaching radio network ' ever @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ addresses . It was noon at San Francisco when the delegates to the convention of the National Electric Light Association gathered there before the rostrum . It was 9 P. M. , English Daylight Time , at London , and 9 P. M. , Central European Time , at Berlin , where members of the World Power Conference were in session , and it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon here . The rebroadcast was intercepted by listeners in this area over WEAF and WJZ with exceptional clearness . No static or atmospherics marred the words of the speakers . Three widely separated points on the earth 's surface were joined together as effectively as if the delegates were within speaking distance of each other . Matthew S. Sloan , president of the New York Edison Company , spoke first from San Francisco . His words were immediately translated into German for the benefit of the conference and listeners at Berlin . Following the radio announcer 's remark , " We will now turn day into night , " and the switching of the circuit to Berlin , listeners heard the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sloan 's address . Then the American listeners heard the murmur at the Berlin gathering which preceded the introduction of Dr. Karl Koettgen , engineer and industrial leader , who spoke In German from Berlin . His words were then translated for English-speaking listeners . The circuit was immediately switched to San Francisco for a few words by Phillip Carlin , announcer of the National Broadcasting CornpanY , and then to England for the address of Lord Derby , retiring president of the World Power Conference , who spoke into a microphone of the British Broadcasting Company at Aldershot , near London . When the key words , marking the end of the subsequent San Francisco announcement , were spoken by the man at that location , the circuit was immediately switched again to the Berlin gathering for an address by the new president of the conference , Dr. Oskar von Miller . With the translation of this talk still ringing in the ears of the radio listeners , the network was switched to San Francisco in time to hear the burst of applause which greeted the reproduction of Dr. von @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a few words more by the San Francisco announcer , the radio listener was taken to London for an address by Senator Guglielmo Marconi , inventor of the wireless . Senator Marconi paid high tribute to . his colleagues in Germany and America , and specially to Thomas A. Edison . Owen D. Young Heard . At 4:40 o'clock , - New York Time , the world-wide radio chain was switched to San Francisco to pick up an address by Owen D. Young , chairman of the board of directors of the General Electric Company . After the German translation of his address was broadcast for the benefit of the conference at Berlin , the network was switched to an oldfashioned , high-ceilinged room at West Orange , N. ? J. , where Mr. Edison awaited his turn to speak. ? Following a vivid description of the many objects of science and mementoes in the quaint old laboratory and a glowing personal tribute to Mr. Edison by George Hicks , ? the announcer , the inventor spoke ' briefly in a steady voice , which was heard to falter only once . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ co-workers . " The broadcast was.terminated at 4:45 o'clock , New York Time , by the San Francisco . announcer . The broadcast , arranged by the National Broadcasting Company and the American Telegraph and Telephone Company , originated in five different places , with the two ? extreme points being more than 5,700. miles apart . Besides the transcontinental networks of WEAF and . WJZ , five international short-wave transmitters distributed the program to many other points on the earth 's surface . Special transcontinental radio and wire facilities were in operation in Europe , an extensive cable and land wire network linking the microphone points of location- in England and Germany . The entire broadcast was handled by the NBC announcer from San Francisco . It was rehearsed last Sunday to insure its success , engineers and announcers going through the series of key words and making the necessary switches . Following are some o. ? the remarks made by the speakers : THE EARL OF DERBY  --  I accepted the presidency of the first World Power Conference because - of my firm belief in the blessing which II will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . * * * Great Britain is an industrial nation requiring utilization to the full of her resources , which is rendered possible by the most recent development in engineering , the use of power for human effort , a power which is used in the lives of every nation . ? * I am constrained to express the hope that a broader culture might ensue from this meeting of expert minds . SENATOR GUGLIELMO MARCONI ? This participation has been made possible by the great advances in radio and telephonic Communication which have now come into active being and which have already linked up the world in a way - that was never experienced before . This tremendous utilization and distribution of electrical power over great distance has only been achieved by the scientists , the engineers ; the industrial organizations and the governments of many . nations , and we are perhaps only now beginning to realize the full benefits the world can reap from a true cooperation of peoples of . all the nations in the realm of Science . OWEN D. YOUNG  --  Science knows ? no national @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is our most productive occupation , just as exploration is our most fascinating activity . Just as the greatest wealth of earlier times came from geographical exploration , so the resources of our time are being vastly enlarged by scientific discovery . Voyages into new domains , whether they be in the atom or in the heavens , bring back richer cargoes than the gold and spices . of the Indies . Those new explorers plant no flags to , evidence national dominion . New lands in science are the ? property of the world . THOMAS A. EDISON  --  As I sit here in my laboratory at Orange , N. J. , talking . to you , my friends of the - National Electrical Light Association , at San Francisco , and to . you , my friends of the World Power Conference , assembled in Berlin , I rejoice in the wonderful radvance that has been made ' in . the art of electrical communication . * * The meetings you are now attending - have a significant importance to the world , which is ever looking - for  - -  further advancement - in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of generation and distribution of electricity for light , heat and power . Your problems will be numerous , but I have no doubt of their successful solution . I have been deeply impressed in observing the magnificent proportions to which electrical development has attained .
