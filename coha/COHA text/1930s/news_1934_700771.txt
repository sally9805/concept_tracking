txt The drumfire of National Socialist propaganda on the Saar Basin Territory began here today and was initiated by Chancellor Adolf Hitler himself . It will continue until the plebiscite that will decide the territory 's fate next January and all signs indicate its success . Barring untoward incidents , the Saar is likely to be German before the end of 1935 . The demonstration that began this concentrated attack lacked none of the impressiveness with which the Nazi propaganda machine invests all such occasions . The Rhineland supplied a picturesque setting . 400,000 Attend Event . About 400,000 Germans , including Storm Troops , members of the Hitler Youth and girls ' organizations , Nazi labor battalions and commercial delegations from all parts of the Reich swarmed into this Old World city , which is beflagged and adorned as it has not been since the end of the Allied occupation . From the Saar itself came 150,000 , some by special trains , 130 of which were run , and almost as many by motorbuses and autos , for which 12,000 parking places had been provided . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of these thousands climbed the steep ascent to the old Fortress of Ehrenbreitstein , which was the centre of the American administration during the occupation . There Chancellor Hitler made his address to the Saar residents  --  which was the feature of the demonstration . Thousands more gathered in the city square , here to listen before fifty loudspeakers carrying the Leader 's words to every corner of it and echoing the speech from all important street intersections . Flags Carried in Procession . Three hundred Nazi flags taken in a procession before the plateau in front of the fortress where the address was delivered and more standards massed in the square lent a touch of color to the proceedings . Below the plateau and to the left and right stretched the Rhine , which is the object of so much German affection  --  its famous bridge of boats lined with swastika banners from . nd to end . And into it , with the city nestles ' in its angle , flowed the silver Moselle , scarcely less a subject of German song and story . As Herr Hitler spoke @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in.substance was an appeal for German loyalty and French complacence in the peaceful restoration of the territory to German allegiance . He attempted to allay any misapprehensions by affirming his government 's acceptance of the principle If church freedom while insisting on the pulpit 's acceptance of National Socialist political domination . Reviews His Works . He reviewed his government 's achievements in reducing unemployment , and he made the usual charges of international hostility designed to weaken Germany  --  economic hostility , which , he said , would be met by self-help in the direction of producing raw materials or substitutes for them at , home . It was Chancellor Hitler 's ? first contact with the Saar people and his first actual participation in the campaign for a German victory in the plebiscite , and it aroused overwhelming enthusiasm . No effort had been overlooked to produce this . A solemn outdoor mass , followed by- an evangelical service , opened the gathering in the morns ing . A solemn procession of Nazi standards immediately preceded the speech in the afternoon , and at its close 10,000 whit* pigeons @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . But the most elaborate of all the accompanying ceremonies was the arrival of the ten final relay men from 150,000 athletes composing the " Loyalty Corps " who had raced from all parts of Germany bringing messages of loyalty to the Fuehrer leader . Herr Osten , German sports leader , presented to Chancellor Hitler each of these as . they arrived breathless with the documents , and the Fuehrer shook his ' hand , made a show of reading the paper and congratulated the runner as the time Of his relay was made known . The message of the Saar itself was written by Herr Piratic ) , leader of the German Front there , and read thus : " Following humiliating betrayal the German Saar was cut off from its German motherland . A fifteen- ' year pilgrimage of pain was forced upon its inhabitants . In spite of everything the Germans of the Saar feel themselves intimately bound with their brothers and sisters in the Reich . " The Germans in the gear wait with a warmed hearth the approaching return to the beloved German Fatherland and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our eternal Germany to demonstrate to the world that the Saar always was Gerfnan and will remain eternally German . " In the name of the German Front I present to you , my Leader , and at the same time to all Ger-I mans the true German greetings of the Saar . With this greeting we swear indestructible German loyal-1 ty to our warmly beloved Germanl Fatherland . " While all this was going on in Coblenz , another 10.1,000 persons in Gilogne attend.d the opening of the Saar exhibition . Chanrellor Hitler , before coming here , visited that by train from Berlin and listened to a speech by Propaganda Minister Goebhels and then traveled up the Rhine by steamboat . He sailed all the way by cheering thousands ashore and by boats lining the banks . " *3ancla played at village landings as he passed arid everywhere flags flew along the shore . Franz von Papen , German Minister to Vienna , who until recently was Reich Commissioner for the Saar , did not attend any of the celebrations . He was said to be resting , not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Soar Valley .
