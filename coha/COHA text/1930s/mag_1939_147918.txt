Late in 1918 , shortly after the Armistice , a young Finn appeared in London , sought out Herbert Hoover , then chairman of the Commission for Relief in Belgium , and appealed to him for food for his starving , war-torn country . Impressed by the facts presented , Mr. Hoover not only arranged to get hold of the food , but persuaded the Allied powers to relax the blockade still being enforced in the Baltic to allow the food to be shipped in . It was a life-saver for the nation in its struggle against the Reds . <P> Ever since that time Rudolf Holsti has played a prominent part in Finnish affairs . For two stretches he was Foreign Minister . At other times he has been the Finnish Minister to Latvia and Estonia and special delegate to the League of Nations . It was he who , as Foreign Minister , signed the " good-neighbor " agreement with the Soviet Union in February 1937 . He and the then Foreign Commissar Maxim Litvinoff became good friends . <P> Fortnight ago this Finnish patriot informed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Russia was guilty of having " attacked not only frontier positions , but also open towns of Finland , sowing death and destruction . " He asked the League to " take all necessary measures to check the aggression . " <P> When the League met in Geneva last week it was unlikely that , having failed to do anything effective to help Manchuria , Ethiopia* or Spain and not having even discussed the disappearance of Austria , Czecho-Slovakia or Poland , + it could check anything at this late date . But a novel project was nevertheless afoot . With Argentina as their spokesman , the six South American nations still remaining in the League ( Argentina , Uruguay , Bolivia , Colombia , Peru , and Ecuador ) demanded that the Soviet Union be expelled and threatened to resign unless the League kicked the Communists out . <P> The Russians sat tight . Foreign Commissar Viacheslav Molotov dispatched a message to League Secretary General Joseph A. C. Avenol which declared that the " Soviet Union is not in a state of war with Finland and does not threaten the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ maintained Comrade Molotov , " the Soviet Union maintains peaceful relations with the democratic Republic of Finland " -a reference to the puppet Soviet Government the Russians set up at Terijoki , Finland , fortnight ago ( TIME , Dec. 11 ) . <P> Russian Delegate Jacob Suritz , also Ambassador to France , kept to his hotel while the League Council , in secret session , debated . Prominent visitor to Comrade Suritz 's suite was the cultured , polished , Dr. V. K. Wellington Koo , the Chinese delegate . One more screwy turn of the 20th Century 's apparently chronic cockayed politics , had put the doctor on another grotesque spot . Once China demanded that the League act against Japanese aggression . Later China supported League action against Italy in Ethiopia . But China , on the other hand , gets much of its war materials from the Soviet Union . Despite China 's desire to keep a clean record against aggression , it was unlikely that Dr. Koo would be able to cast a vote against Russia .         @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
