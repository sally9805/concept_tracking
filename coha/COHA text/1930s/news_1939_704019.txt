txt William Lurie , a middle-aged lawyer and former school teacher who still treasures a red leather wallet given to him as a Christmas present in 1937 by Kings County Judge George W. Martin , testified yesterday at the jurist 's trial on bribery charges . He swore that while acting as attorney for a Brooklyn physician indicted on an abortion charge he gave $1,000 in cash to Judge Martin and that subsequently Judge Martin granted his motion to dismiss the indictment . The witness closed his direct testimony against the man he described as a former business associate and luncheon companion by burying his head in his hands and sobbing so loudly that the court ordered a recess . He also testified that several days before the money was passed he had discussed the case in Judge Martin 's chambers and the jurist had told him , " Bill , do n't worry . I 'll take care of you . " Lurie insisted , however , that Judge Martin had requested the money as a " loan " because he was " financially pressed by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not testify to any conversation with Judge Martin directly linking the money with an announced intent to " fix " the abortion case , although it is the contention of the prosecutor , Special Assistant Attorney General John Harlan Amen , that the money represented a bribe for that purpose . Voices Friendship to Martin Under cross-examination , Lurie , who earlier had admitted that in his ten years ' acquaintanceship with Judge Martin he had been assigned by the jurist as defense counsel in two murder cases and also was appointed to four or five lunacy commissions , asserted in an emotion-strained voice , " I felt very kindly to Judge Martin then , and I feel very kindly to him now . " At the close of the day 's session Judge Martin made an impassioned and oratorical plea , in the absence of the jury , in which he urged the court not to allow the grand jury minutes in the abortion case to be put in evidence by the prosecution , asserting that an unfavorable ruling to him would " wreck my entire case " and charging @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a fair trial . " " I am fighting right now in the front line trenches for a reputation of sixty-three years and I 'm trying to clear it but the prosecution wo n't give me a chance , " Judge Martin said . " They want to dewive me of my fundamental rights . Who would n't be prejudiced after reading the minutes about the gruesome details of an abortion ? " The only thing I 'm charged with here is an alleged bribery . I have nothing to do with the facts of this abortion and its horrible details . I did n't pass on the facts , I passed on the law when I dismissed the indictment . I was right and I stand on it . " This is a most dangerous thing . I passed on the law and if there was anything wrong about it the District Attorney had the right to go to the Appellate Division and review it . Why did n't they do that ? Because I was right , that 's why . " If you let the jury see these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ review me on my actions as a judge ruling on the law . That 's illegal . They do n't know the law . For that matter , many lawyers do n't . Who are these jurors to judge the law ? " If these minutes are seen by the jury they will wreck my entire case , they will wreck my hope that this jury will judge me without any prejudice . The prosecution wants to create a prejudice against me , an atmosphere that I ca n't fight . Mr. Amen has no intention of giving me a fair trial ; he knows that this will create a prejudice . " Suppose the jury sees these minutes and says Martin is guilty ? They will be deciding on the facts and it was on the law that I passed and I wrote a memorandum to that effect and cited decisions and precedent . Even you could n't pass on that law , oply the Appellate Division can review my decision and you ca n't make a jury an Appellate Division . " Throughout his plea Judge Martin's'voice rose and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eloquence held the spectators in rapt attention and recalled to many veteran lawyers and court attaches Judge Martin 's reputation as one of the city 's outstanding criminal lawyers before he went on the bench nineteen years ago . William Butler , legal assistant to Mr. Amen , argued that the grand fury minutes should be put in evidence on the ground that the " sole issue before the jury is whether Judge Martin had made an honest judgment in dismissing the indictment . " William W. Kleinman , David F. Price and John P. Carroll , all of defense counsel , argued in behalf of Judge Martin , citing various decisions and precedents in law . They held that the Court 's ruling was so important to the case that presiding Justice Francis D. McCurn should read the grand jury minutes overnight before ruling on the issue . Justice McCurn said that he had anticipated the question arising at the trial and that he had studied the law pertaining to the matter , but that he would accede to the request of defense counsel and " read the grand jury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have my decision in the morning , although on the law I 'll probably let them into evidence , " Lurie was the first witness called by the prosecution for the trial , which started last Monday .
