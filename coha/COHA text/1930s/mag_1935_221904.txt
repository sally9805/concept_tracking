On the mine selling price of every lump of the nation 's soft coal last week fell a new 15% Federal tax , 90% of which will be rebated to producers who sign the NRA-like code prescribed by the Bituminous Coal Conservation Act of 1935 . Moving promptly to resolve what President Roosevelt called " doubt , however reasonable , " as to the Act 's constitutionality , President James W. Carter of Virginia 's and West Virginia 's Carter Coal Co. lost one decision to the Government , won one against his family in District of Columbia Supreme Court . <P> Because the tax is not payable until Jan. 2 , Justice Jesse C. Adkins refused President Carter a temporary injunction against forced code compliance , promised decision on his application for a permanent injunction within ten days . Justice Adkins gave the coal man a temporary injunction restraining his company from complying voluntarily with the code . President Carter wanted that because his stockholders , who are also members of his family , wanted to sign up without any legal quibbling . <P> When the new @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ U. S. bituminous coal producers had signed the code but they accounted for almost one half the nation 's annual output . The National Bituminous Coal Commission gave laggards a vigorous prod by promising strict enforcement of the Act 's Section 14 , which prohibits the purchase of codeless coal not only by the Government but by all private agencies serving the Government , such as PWA contractors and mail-carrying railroads.
