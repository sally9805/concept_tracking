In voting a $22,682,041 deficiency appropriation last month , the U. S. Senate transferred control of $850,000 in Wage &; Hour Division funds from Secretary of Labor Frances Perkins to Administrator Elmer Frank Andrews . By the time the bill returned to the House for action on Senate amendments last week , the prestige of Madam Secretary was clearly at issue . <P> " ... I cast no reflection upon the Secretary of Labor , " said Missouri Democrat John J. Cochran , proposing to concur with the Wage-Hour amendment . Ever vigilant in behalf of public women , New Jersey Democrat Mary Teresa Norton angrily asked why the House should pick on her friend the Secretary . " A rather embarrassing situation , " observed Democratic Majority Leader Sam Rayburn of Texas . <P> Said a gentleman from Virginia , Clifton Alexander Woodrum : " If you wish to take a crack at somebody , I can not stop you . ... It will be construed that our party is repudiating a Cabinet member . . . . " <P> " Has the gentleman in his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attitude of the membership of this House ? " barked crude Edward Eugene Cox of Georgia . <P> " I would not wish to say that , no , " replied Mr. Woodrum . <P> To say exactly that , cackling Republicans and frank Democrats ganged up 137 to 93 .
