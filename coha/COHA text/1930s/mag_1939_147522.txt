A woman who had just heard him lecture asked the late , great Chicago educator , Francis Wayland Parker : <P> " How early can I begin the education of my child ? " <P> " When will your child be born ? " <P> " Born ? " she gasped . " Why , he is already five years old ! " <P> " My goodness , woman , " he cried , " do n't stand here talking to me-hurry home-already you have lost the best five years . " <P> The Survey Graphic , " magazine of social interpretation , " thus keynoted " the challenge of democracy to education " in its October issue last week . Survey Graphic last February began an attempt to arouse sluggish U. S. democrats with a trumpeting series entitled " Calling America . " Because it believes that " democracy begins in the cradle , " the magazine devoted its entire October issue to an appraisal of the U. S. educational system , by 31 famed educators and journalists . <P> Question before the house was whether democracy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by the dictatorships ' single-track efficiency in grinding out Nazis , Communists who know just what is expected of them , most of Survey Graphic 's experts gloomily concluded that democracy 's schools are not at the moment prepared to meet the competition . Because U. S. schools ( like the U. S. people ) do not pretend to know all the answers , these experts proposed that what U. S. Education needs is a big blue print . <P> But if they confused education with propaganda , the experts were clear , if unoriginal , on specific failings of U. S. schools : <P> Educational opportunities are unequal : Allyn Burleson 's children in California get twice as much schooling as Brother David 's in Nebraska , three times as much as Brother John 's in Kentucky . At least 800,000 have no schools at all . &gt;The teaching profession , says Smith College 's retired President William Allan Neilson , consists largely of " timid and unimaginative persons to whom moderate comfort , a moderate competence , moderate security are the reward for a moderate amount of moderately conscientious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of U. S. youths , says John Chamberlain , are out of school and jobless , growing " ugly and morose . " <P> Educators know not where they are going , says Eduard C. Lindeman : " Current discussions of educational goals seem to me to have reached a stage of utter confusion . " <P> Against these liabilities , Survey Graphic 's experts balanced hopeful assets : <P> Employing about 1,000,000 people ( four times as many as General Motors , three times as many as the U. S. Army ) , spending some $2,000,000,000 instructing one of every four inhabitants , education is still the biggest U. S. business . <P> Progressive experimentation is " rolling steadily forward . " <P> Education for democracy is reaching closer to the cradle ; nursery schools , be , ginning on two-year-olds , today number 800 . <P> Colleges and universities have raised their standards , by such experiments as the tutorial system and the junior college are better meeting the needs of individual students .                @ @ @ @ @
