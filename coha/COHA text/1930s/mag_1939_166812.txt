Idle and restless at last week 's end were 55,000 Chrysler employes and upwards of 50,000 more in affected supply plants . It was 30 days since Chrysler Corp . began to answer union slowdowns with shutdowns in Detroit . Wage losses totted up to $4,000,000 . The corporation had lost the first cream of 1940 's new business , seemed willing to go on losing while its executives and union spokesmen bickered , belied each other , failed even to agree on what the fighting was about . Union wives badgered their men to get back to work . Union men wished heartily that " The Old Man " - stricken Board Chairman Walter P. Chrysler-was back running his automobile plants . <P> Into this sorry mess stepped Michigan 's senile , godly , sometimes cunning Governor Luren Dudley Dickinson . To Lansing he summoned Chrysler 's President K. T. Keller and Vice President Herman Weckler , the C. I. O. United Automobile Workers ' President Roland Jay Thomas , Richard Frankensteen , et al . No strong man , 80-year-old Mr. Dickinson tried none of the around-the-clock @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to stubborn negotiators . As though he were teaching his Bible class in the Center Eaton Methodist Church near Charlotte , Mich. , Luren Dickinson piped : " . . . If you have faith , and apply the Golden Rule , you can get together . " For two hours his pupils did unto each other as they had been done by for weeks , swapping acrimonies and getting nowhere . The Governor pared his nails , enjoined his guests to have faith , occasionally bent an ear to the whisperings of his omnipresent adviser , " Judge " Emerson R. Boyles . Once Mr. Dickinson burst out at Mr. Keller : " Do you mean you refuse cooperation ? " Chrysler 's smooth , ingratiating Attorney Nicholas Kelley referred gently to " our friends across the table , " said : " I ca n't believe we wo n't settle this controversy . " <P> By letting in a little outside air on the stale quarrel , Governor Dickinson 's interference had some good effect on both sides . At a later get-together with Federal Conciliator James F. Dewey @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , who beamed right back at Mr. Frankensteen . They had agreed on some minor provisions for a new bargaining contract but had yet to settle their prime differences : 1 ) whether the management alone should decide how hard &; fast union men shall work , and 2 ) whether union men shall have first call on Chrysler jobs . <P> .
