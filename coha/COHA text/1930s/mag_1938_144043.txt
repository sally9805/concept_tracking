Adolf Hitler , referring in his Reichstag speech fortnight ago to the 3,200,000 Germans in Czechoslovakia , gave a vague but menacing impression that the Nazi Reich was prepared to fight on their behalf . Last week General Jan Ludwig Krejci , Chief of the General Staff bluntly announced at Prague : " Czechoslovakia must be prepared to defend herself alone for the first few days against a brutal and quick attack by motorized forces , assisted by aviation-an attack without warning ! " <P> General Krejci further stressed that Czechoslovakia is already building emergency fortifications along her German frontier ; that the great Skoda Munitions Works , one of the largest in Europe , is being moved ( from beer-famed Pilsen near the border ) to the central part of the country ; that Soviet Russia and France are sworn military allies of the Czechoslovak Republic . <P> When the French Government a few days later renewed its pledge that France will stand with Czechoslovakia if Prague calls for aid , Czechoslovakia felt vastly bucked up . President Eduard Benes announced that Prague will refuse to discuss @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its German minority . The soup , said Dr. Benes. philosophically , " is never eaten as hot as it is boiled . " * <P> In Berlin all this was accepted without protest . With Mr. Chamberlain planning a four power pact that is not to include Russia , it looked to German observers as if Czechoslovakia 's Soviet support might soon evaporate . In that event they hoped that Germany might perhaps get the German part of Czechoslovakia as part of a general European settlement without the necessity of fighting for it . <P> *A Czech proverb.
