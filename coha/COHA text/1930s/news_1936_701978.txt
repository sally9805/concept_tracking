txt Monaco Forbids Strikes In view of the serious prejudice to this district which might be caused by incorrect reports of industrial troubles , may I make it clear to American readers , and especially to tourists , that the Principality of Monaco is an independent State and strikes are not per-mitted ? At a recent meeting of the Consultative Chamber , a body elected to protect the interests of foreigners , it was officially stated on behalf of the government that the terms laid down in the treaty signed wtih France in 1918 remained unchanged . In other words , while there is no intention of allowing residence in Monaco to become a means of fiscal evasion for French subjects , the economic interests of foreigners will be protected and their freedom from taxation maintained . M. AUDRA , Manager National Tourist Office . Monte Carlo , June 20 , 1936.
