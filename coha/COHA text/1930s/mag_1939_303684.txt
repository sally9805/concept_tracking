&gt; While harried Berlin shopkeepers were weighing out butter , sugar and such treasures on apothecary scales last week , Paris , after the early trade dislocations of mobilization , was almost back on its pre-war standard of gastronomic abundance . Great slabs of butter , vast arrays ' of fowls and meats , luxuriant vegetables and enormous cheeses , plus mounds of grapes and apples decked the counters of Paris food shops and the snail season opened last week with a great smacking of appreciative French lips . <P> The Government , noting a relative oversupply of pork , mutton . and horse meat , strove to increase their consumption by ordering no beef sold on Tuesdays . Les Halles , the famed central markets to which bored night clubbers used to go at dawn for a bowl of onion soup , last week were open only during the day , and tout Paris chuckled at the story that two brown bears , slaughtered , dressed and on sale at Les Halles , were named " Hitler " and " Stalin . " <P> &gt;The State Opera @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ play until 11 p. m. , and in Montparnasse the famed Select reopened , joining the Caf de la Rotonde , La Coupole and Dme , all of which are still half boarded up in vague protection against air raids . Congenital rebels , Paris artists and littrateurs flocked to such nightspots as Caf de Flore and Caf des Deux Magots near Saint Germain des Prs , complaining loudly that the Government is protecting with sandbags only the most artistically orthodox Paris statues and monuments such as the Obelisk in the Place de la Concorde . The enormous Arc de Triomphe was not yet fully covered with sandbags last week , but the Eiffel Tower was dirty grey with 90,000 pounds of fresh war paint camouflage . &gt; On the Paris fashion front , Molyneux was the first big-name couturier to stage an opening since World War II , showed a collection of 40 models instead of the usual 200 . Swank customers like the Hon. Mrs. Reginald ( " Daisy " ) Fellowes tried to put patriotism on a par with fashion by vigorously knitting socks for soldiers as the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wealthy customers in sight , the Molyneux salesclerks , hitherto notoriously snooty , for the first time were relatively cordial to anyone who looked as if she might be able to pay Molyneux prices . <P> &gt; On the labor front , about 1,000,000 skilled French workers were beginning to feel the War decree forbidding a man to quit his job in a Government-requisitioned factory , even if he does not like to work 72 hours a week with half-pay for overtime . This prevents private employers from tempting skilled workers away by offers of higher wages , and punishment is swift . Le Petit Parisien reported the case of proletarian Louis Combe , 52 , a decorated war veteran rated 75% disabled , employed in making vital tools for French aircraft factories . On Sept. 18 he quit his job , was promptly arrested , tried and last week sentenced to two months in jail , plus a fine of 100 gold francs .
