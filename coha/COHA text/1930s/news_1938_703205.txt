txt Roosevelt Administration sustained the worst defeat in the House se -- ter ciay since the wage-hour bill was rejected , a hile in the Servile , grossing hominy threatened to engulf the Roosevelt federal reor gamza non bill Taken together , and with increasing apathy to Roosevelt melt and measures in Congress the es ( it are symptomatic of something deeper that Is going on in the I ernelature . Many bills good in them-seises , are being attacked from 1151f a dozen fronts on the basis of general opposition to the New Deal The lack of enthusiasm which has gradually accumulated due immerhateIv to the continuing business rece , - ion. and cultivated by dozens of different contests in which the New Deal has attempted to force its will upon reluctant Congressmen , nos appears to be turning into balky revolt Recognition of the new attitude , - Was seen in the announcement by ; Majority Leader Rayburn , as he left the White House after a conference ' with the President , that Mr. Roosevelt would not ask Congress for anti-monopoly legislation this session . There are appearances that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Rayburn ' declared , In this connection . that Ithe House can complete its present legislative program by April 15 . Tax Defeat Spectacular The defeat in the House yesterday was decisive and spectacular . The so-called " Third Basket " tax , covering " Section 1-B ' corporations , was thrown out of the Tax Act of 1938 , 180 to 124 . This defeat was administered as the House sat as a Committee of the Whole . and may yet be reconsidered and reversed under Administration pressure when the bill again comes up . Secretary Morgenthau said the present bill , as revised . is $41.000 - 000 short of the $5,300.000.000 in its prospective revenues . The Treasury , he said , is prepared to co-operate with Congress in proposing alternative sources of income . There can be no doubt , howes er , that the Administration had set its whole heart on the Section 1-5 o-vision . The fact that it affected directly only 300 to 600 companies did not give a measure of Its importance . Under its piovisains , big family-held corporations like Ford , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their family stock-. holders . Where Government Would Win The latter could promptly put inc money back again into the company as reinvestments , but in the process of passing the profits from one pocket to another the Government ZOt some of the money in passing  --  In increased income surtaxes . Thus , the tax imposed pressure upon Henry Foid , say , to pay himself his own profits , which of course greatly creased his annual income . and his income taxes , and brought that much greater revenue to the Gm-eminent . Thus the chief effect of the proposed 1-B tax was not on the immediate $40,000,000 of revenue it would raise itself , as in forcing out dividends which the Treasury could tap through already exist= income taxes It already has been shown In this correspondence that Henry For d has adopted a dividend policy that eliminates his company entirely from the Section 1-5 , and Treasury officials asserted any other company could easily eliminate itself , simply by making a proportion of dividend distributions equal to that of tee , average corporations of the countr : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Treasury asserted , rt would be by its own volition . Companies with anything short of 675.06 ( 1 Income would be automatically exempt anyway , thereby confining the provision in any case to the 81.000,000 capitalization class , But despite these argument-9. and to the evident complete surprise of Administration leaders yesterday . the House members revolted , and threw the whole tax situation into confusion . The blow to the Administration is the more important because it is a rap at its prestige . Mr. Roosevelt has gone down the line for this section against widespread newspaper opposition and his advisers have included it in his panoply of characteristic New Deal " reforms . " The temper of the House yesterday was characteristic of the temper of Congress as a whole , which has held up New Deal legislation pretty consistently since the Supreme Court reorganization-battle . It is not one of outright revolt , but of reluctance to adopt any new and untried ' course . It is a sort of legislative sit-down strike . It is apathetic rather than militant . The members face an election @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ recession and growing unemployment have not increased their popularity , and it is in this area of doubt and potential disillusionment that they meet White House proposals for new legislation . Since the President lost his court fight , the farm bill is practically the only genuine New Deal " reform " scheme of the first water which Congress has passed . The housing hill was hardly a controversial issue . The special session of Congress passed no legislation ; the wage-hour bill has been blocked so far ; Mr. Roosevelt had to deliver a sharp lecture at a press conference to get the publicity salary feature restored to the pending revenue bill , and at that with the figure for publicity raised from " $15,000 to $75,000 . The reorganization bill is encountering unexpected opposition in the Senate , and the White House seems to have recognized the changed mood by voluntarily refraining from sending up striking new bills . Hinges on the Recession The turning point in the affair is the business situation , so far as can be seen here . The slump has entered politics . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mr. Roosevelt had an easy time with Congress . With unemployment now increasing again , after five years of immense deficits intended to end unemployment , Congress is losing its enthusiasm , or at any rate Is becoming critical . It is too early to forecast a permanent change , but at any rate the affair has gone far enough to reassure the fringe of New Deal opponents who thought Mr. Roosevelt might become a " dictator " and take over the control of Congress . Congress has never seemed more independent than today . This is truer of the Senate than of the House . There are five Democrats to every one Republican in the Senate , and yet Mr. Roosevelt may be fortunate to get his reorganization bill through . This is characteristic of American history : an Administration generates its own opposition . As a party , the Republicans have almost ceased to function in the Senate , but there is an opposition party there for all that , though it does not have a formal name or organization . For all practical pur1 poses it is a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and national leadership would be a formidable contender for the Presidency . Opponents of the Byrnes-Roose , volt reorganization bill are led by the bitter die-hards of the court battles , Senators Bailey , Burke , Wheeler , t combined with the economy group , under Senator Byrd , who want retorganization linked with slashing I federal reductions of expenditures . ' The reorganization bill is a composite bill , each feature of which has particular enemies and opponents . The political skill of the opposition lies in welding a majority out of these shifting factions . There is undoubtedly a majority in the Senate for the general idea of reorgani zation , but on any specific point there may be a minority . The great game of log-rolling and trading votes is thus in full swing . The three controversial points of the reorganization bill are : 1 . Giving the President authority to combine or eliminate Federal agencies ; 2 . Replacing the three-member Civil Service Commission with a single administrator , appointed for a 15-year term , Guth a civilian advisory agency ; 3 . Substitution of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
