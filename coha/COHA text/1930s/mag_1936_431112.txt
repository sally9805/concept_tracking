 | Giving the Theater Back to the'People Condensed from Common Sense C. C. Moustcckis The Federal Theater Project is now the largest theatrical producer in the United States , with 158 plays showing and rehearsing , 10 , 700 people on its payroll , playing to an audience of ; 350,00o nightly from coast to coast . And an amazed New York has seen the United States Government set up the best batting average yet recorded  --  three hits out of its first five productions on Broadway . Last September Washington allotted $6,700,000 to the FTP and appointed Mrs. Hallie Flanagan , who is widely experienced in theatrical . work , as National Director . Mrs. Flanagan believed that " we need throughout America a number of theaters experimental in nature , specializing in new plays of unknown dramatists , with emphasis on local material . " Under her inspiration the FTP is realizing this aim but its scope is also wider . Works of unknown dramatists compete with Shakespeare ; racial groups do plays of their own literature ; dramas built around such subjects as " Samuel @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . From the beginning the FTP has fought opposition from pri- vate interests fearing " government competition " - although even in the good years of zg27-28 , according to Actors ' Equity Association , the theatrical profession could keep no more than 30 percent of its members employed longer than 15 weeks .

In an era of stereotyped Hollywood entertainment and radio  | competition , the high-priced Broadway theater is in the status of an obsolete handicraft facing the competition of factory goods . It is falling more and more under the financial control of Hollywood . A third of this year 's plays were backed by the West Coast . The FTP with its low prices is tapping a market Broadway never could reach - with beneficial results . One of the shrewdest New York cut-rate ticket agencies sold tickets for a government play without profit , because " it 's edu- cating people to go back to the theater . " Uncle Sam has brought new vitality and dignity to the " show biz , " and although the original Federal allotment is about used up , some of the FTP units are now able to move under their own power . Whether or not a new Federal allotment is forthcoming , the FTP is a significant beginning toward a new conception of the theater and it has justified its premise that " Art is the business @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
