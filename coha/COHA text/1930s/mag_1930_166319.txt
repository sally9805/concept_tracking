Fifty years ago the grey little city of Paisley , seven miles outside of Glasgow , was world famed because beauties who could not afford real Cashmere shawls draped their drooping shoulders with " Paisley shawls " of soft wool , printed by Scots with Indian designs . Ladies no longer wear shawls . Paisley 's Calvinist spinners make a modest living today spinning cotton thread . <P> Good Scotch Calvinists disapprove of Christmas , consider Christmas trees and Christmas presents to be popish and heathen things , savoring of idolatry . Scotch bairns wait for their toys till Hogmanay , New Year 's Eve . On New Year 's Eve last week , Paisley children were up with the dawn , shouting under housewives ' windows : <P> Hogmanay ! <P> Trollolay ! <P> Gie 's o ' your white bread and none o ' your gray ! <P> It promised to be a specially good Hogmanay for Paisley bairns , for the manager of the Glen Motion Picture Theatre had advertised a holiday matinee for children . In deference to Scotch ethics it was not a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Just after lunch 800 children clutching grimy pennies trooped to the Glen Theatre and sat on hard wooden benches to watch the unreeling of The Crowd , a slightly morbid U. S. cinema depicting the struggles of a New York clerk and the distressing death of his little daughter . The only grownups in the audience were the theatre 's three scrubwomen , delegated to the task of suppressing unnecessary Hogmanay enthusiasms . <P> Half way through the film came a spurt of flame , a cloud of acrid black smoke from the projection booth . The cinema operator 's assistant , quick-witted , tore the roll of blazing film from his machine ran with it to the manager who threw it out of a window . He was not in time to avert panic . Children , nerves atingle from the film play , screamed in terror , stampeded for the only exit they knew , the main door . Someone slipped . <P> In an instant the door was blocked . Brutal with fear the bigger children fought , kicked , trampled the little ones under foot . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , fought to show children to the side door . He could rescue only 30 . Fear-crazed youngsters tried to climb up on the wall gas brackets , out of the panic . The brackets broke , flooded the theatre with gas . <P> Brass-helmeted firemen , rushing to the rescue , found the Glen Theatre 's doors blocked solid with bodies " like a wall of cement bags . " Cutting a hole through the roof , smashing windows they formed a living chain to pass out 70 small bodies , many trampled beyond recognition under stout Scotch boots . Inside the theatre , a few calm children were still alive . <P> Rain fell all night . While weeping parents tiptoed through three wards of the Royal Alexandra Infirmary , a temporary morgue , trying to identify their children , members of the Town Council met privately , voted $5,000 for a public funeral , started an investigation . At midnight a group of Paisley citizens gathered in the main square , softly sang " Auld Lang Syne. "           @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
