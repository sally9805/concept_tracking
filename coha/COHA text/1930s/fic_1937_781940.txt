 | dropped to an emotional depth . He felt weak , depressed , lost . He could n't talk any more . Rising slowly , he said , " I think I 'll go now , Polly . You must be busy and I  --  well , I 'm all mixed up . But you know how much happiness I wish you , do n't you ? And you must know that if you ever need me , I 'll do anything in the world for you . I sha n't stop caring , you know . " Polly 's eyes filled with tears , brimmed over . She came close to him . " I know , Tommy , " she whispered . " Please kiss me good-bye . "  | AS Tommy walked slowly eastward , the last gleaming shred of the day 's happiness dropped from him . He felt utterly alone in an utterly empty world . The let-down had been too sudden , too complete . He had gone to Polly tingling with life , eager to see her , hungry for her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of play and rest had given him surging vitality , a healthy animal vigor that cried for release in love . The excitement of the day had made his nerves sing , but the key had been too high , the emotion too long sustained . He had expected to relax in Polly 's arms , to climax the excitement with ecstasy , and then sink with her into dreamless peace  --  and now , now denied the happiness he had so naturally expected , his body ached with weariness . He felt too tired to move and , at the same time , too nervous to rest . And worst of all , he felt alone , pitifully , inescapably alone . His apartment was a block from the East River in the Fifties . He left Third Avenue behind . There were fewer people about him now , fewer taxicabs in the street . The shops seemed grimy , the people sitting in the doorways all dark and unkempt . Ugly , New York was really ugly . Back of its lights and towers  --  only a block or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . And emptiness . A taxi honked ; somewhere above him a child screamed . He shivered . . . . An emptiness ; that 's what he was living in  --  an ugly emptiness broken with painful sounds . Another block and the street was almost deserted . The buildings lifted blank facades toward a dark sky , and the  | occasional rectangle of yellow light only stressed the blankness and the darkness . His depression sank deeper into him . The world was empty . Somebody was there , though ; in a vague , subconscious way he knew that somebody had been there for a full minute . Somebody had touched his arm , moved away , touched it again . He turned his head . Only a pace to his right there was a girl looking up at him with bright questioning eyes . She was very young , even pretty . The lights of a taxi flashed across her face , and the prettiness was gone . Nothing was left but the mascara on her eyelashes , the rouge on her checks and lips . For @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than like a girl ; then the lights were past and she was pretty again . She smiled and Tommy paused . " Keep on walking , " she said softly . " There 's a cop on the next corner . " " All right , sister , " he agreed . " What are you working an empty street for ? " " It 's not empty ; you 're here . " She smiled at him pertly . " And you look lonely . " " Do n't all men alone look lonely ? " Tommy did n't know why he was talking to the girl , but at the moment even a chippie off the streets seemed better than the blankness . " Oh , no ! " she exclaimed . " Lots of ' em are on their way somewhere , and lot 's of ' em are coming from somewhere . You know what I mean , doncha ? " Tommy grinned . " Yes , I know . My mind is pure , but I know . Awl I tike it that I do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ going anywhere . Well , you 're right . I have n't and I 'm not . " She moved closer to him so that her arm touched his . " You 're a nice guy and would treat a girl right , " she said softly , her voice urgent . " And I 'd treat you right , too . Honest I would . How about it , mister ? "  | Tommy stopped in a shadow and studied her . She was a soft little thing , not up to his shoulder . In the darkness her eyes were luminous . Was it desire , really desire ? He wondered . Her slightly parted lips promised everything . And why not ? Women like her were made for lonely men like him . There was no one for him to be loyal to , no one to care what he did . And he was so damned tired of trying ? trying to be loyal only to lose what he was loyal to . He was tired of everything , tired all over . Again a taxi passed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the girl was transformed into a painted mask . She moved and a wave of cheap perfume offended his nostrils . Why fool himself ? He did n't want this girl . He did n't want any girl . . . . " No , sister , " he said almost regretfully , " it 's no go . But I 'm glad you spoke to me . You would n't understand , and maybe I do n't  --  but I 'm glad . " He put his hand in his pocket and drew out his wallet . " Will you have a drink on me ? " To his surprise , she drew back . " Aw , I ai n't no beggar . I like you , mister . You look nice . Honest , you wo n't be sorry . " " That 's just the point . I would be . But I like you , too . I 've disappointed you and I 'll feel better if you 'll take a little something for a drink or maybe a pair of gloves . I know you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if that 's the way you feel . " She took the hill without looking at it . " Thanks . " Then she smiled . " I bet your girl took a walk-out powder on you . " Startled , Tommy asked , " What makes you think that ? " " Lots of young fellers live around here . ' Bout every so often , a guy says to me , ' O.K. , kid ; to hell with her . ' That 's the way you looked . " Tommy touched her arm . " You 've got brains above your job . Now I 've got to be going . I hope you have better luck with the next fellow . " She seemed to wilt a little then as she looked vaguely  | up and down the street . " Maybe I wo n't like the next one , " she said , wistfulness in her voice . " I liked you . " " Maybe you would n't if you knew me better . Well , goodnight . " " Goodnight , mister . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ realized it , there was more life in his step now , more lift to his head . The little street-walker had given him something when he needed it  --  not much , but something . She had filled a small spot in the great emptiness , given him for the moment a feeling of personality , an awareness of his humanness among others who were human . She had liked him . It was n't only his money she had wanted , but her hungry little body had actually yearned for his . He had a vague regret that his had n't yearned equally for hers , but he was so damned tired  --  and , oh well , a girl like that . . . But it was comforting , just the same , to hear her say that he was nice , to have her feel that he would be kind . He had n't really wanted her . He wondered why not . It was his background , he supposed , his upbringing  --  something of the sort that always acted as a check whenever a prostitute @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had brought her along ? He belonged to nobody ; nobody belonged to him . There was nobody in the past to injure and nobody in the future . Surely his body was his to do what he pleased with , and the girl had really liked him . Then , smiling grimly to himself , he shook his head . He was arguing like a child tempted to snitch a piece of candy . He did n't believe a thing he was thinking . If he had taken that girl , he would hate her and hate himself . Background , upbringing , whatever it was , he was like that . There were standards lie could n't escape ; obligations he had formed with himself that were more binding than moral theories ever were . He could argue moral theories away , but no argument would touch the obligations . They had nothing  | to do with arguments ; perhaps they were even irrational . He did n't know and he hardly cared to know . They were a part of him , stern , inescapable . In @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he was . They took their satisfaction where they found it and had no regrets . Life , he thought , was simpler for them . Oh well , what was the use of thinking about it ? He was feeling low ; that was all , or he would n't have been tempted . He could n't leave Polly and take to a girl in the streets . He was a fool even to think he could . When he switched on the lights in his apartment , its perfectly neat , somehow alien atmosphere struck him more forcibly than it ever had before . He sometimes wished that Maribelle 's eye were less accurately geometrical . She saw to it that he had a place for everything and that everything was in its place . The magazines that had accumulated during his absence were laid on a table , one overlapping the next with perfect precision . The pillows on the davenport had been plumped and smoothed until they seemed cast out of metal , and each chair was in its appointed spot . Everything was ordered , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ taken care of that apartment , and day after day she carefully erased any evidence he might have left of his own personality . With becoming modesty she never left any evidence of her own ; yet , though he had never seen her , he felt that he knew her well . When Tommy had first rented the apartment , the janitor had come to him . He was a grinning black man , slovenly and amiable . " I 'm Charlie , " he explained , " an ' I takes care of the furnace . You got somebody to take care of this ' ere ' pahtment , Mr. Gray ? Mebbe you takes care of it yo ' own self . " " No , " Tommy said . " No , I do n't want to take care of it . Do you know of somebody ? Do you want the job ? " " No , suh , I don ' want no mo ' jobs . I got all the job I wants ,  | but my sistah Maribelle , she takes care of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care of ' em good . An ' she wo n't ' sturb you none , neither . She comes when you ai n't heah . " Then and there Tommy engaged Maribelle sight unseen . Charlie told him to leave any messages on the ice-box , and the money too . " Maribelle 's gennelmums allus leaves the money on the ice-box , " Charlie said . " She gits it . You leaves pencil an ' paper there , an ' Maribelle writes effen she needs anythin ' . She don ' come Sundays an ' holidays , Mr. Gray . Is that all right wif you ? " Tommy assured him that it was quite all right , that he liked to sleep late when he had a chance and preferred not to be disturbed . So it was arranged , and so Maribelle entered his life  --  a black jinnee who came from nowhere to disappear into the somewhere , absolutely efficient , totally invisible . The owner of the apartment house had long ago dismissed Charlie , and so the pad and pencil on the icebox @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had left town for his vacation , he scribbled a note saying that he was going and that he would be back on a certain date . He had returned to find the apartment in its usual perfect order . His unpacking the night before had been hasty and incomplete . Now his suitcases had disappeared along with the dirty clothes he had left strewn over chairs . Once more the apartment looked like a hotel sitting-room just after an especially conscientious maid had finished her job . Yet tonight the apartment , as it sometimes had in the past , reminded him of Freda . Somehow those pieces of furniture had carried with them from Albany some faint memory of her . More than once he had wished that he had been less economical and had sold every chair , table , and bed that she had bought ; but he had been guided by the spirit of his frugal New England ancestors and refused to take a needless loss . The furniture was good , he had argued ; so why sell it and then buy more just like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had n't bought so much as a doily without consuiting  | him . And how she had worked to furnish those four rooms ! Timid , inexperienced , unsure , she had visited every model room she could find in Albany and New York . Even then , she had turned to Tommy for guidance and reassurance . In the end , she had done well . Every one had thought the apartment charming . Well , thought Tommy , throwing his hat and topcoat on the davenport , this apartment was n't charming . Polly 's two rooms were half the size of his , her furniture had cost half as much ; yet she had made a lovely home , while the best he and Maribelle together could do was to make an offensively well-balanced emptiness . Even Freda , scared as she was , had done better . She 'd had a way with flowers , and , then , she was so exquisitely decorative herself . The rooms seemed hollow with silence . He switched on the radio . A torch singer was howling like a lonesome @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was better . Brahms . . . . Good orchestra too . " Now , " he decided , " what I need is a drink . Then maybe I 'll relax and get some sense . I 've been acting like a fool kid . " He went to the kitchen . Habit led him to look at the pad on the ice-box . Good ! Maribelle had had something to say . He ripped off the top sheet and read : " Dere Mr. Gray , you sure come back dirty . Them kakee pance stink awful , you must of set in sumthing rotten or sumthing . I called yore laundrey and gave the man everything cause I nowed you dident want them stinkin things round here , I bawt soap , 50 cents . You needed it bad . Verey truley , Maribelle . " Tommy chuckled . Maribelle 's spelling and her respect for punctuation always amused him , and he suspected that her humor was n't always as unintentional as it might seem . He placed a half-dollar in a glass that always stood @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pencil , thought a moment , and then wrote : " Dear Maribelle : Here 's the money . Thanks for taking care of the laundry . The smell  | came from honest sweat . I 'm going to invite three friends in for an evening next week . We 'll want sandwiches . If I ask them for Monday , can you take care of things for me ? T. Gray . " The question was merely a formality . Maribelle was a true jinnee ; she needed no warning , no time . A scribbled request always brought something better than he had hoped for . There would be sandwiches in the kitchen Monday evening  --  delicious sandwiches covered with a slightly dampened cloth . There would be beer in the ice-box , napkins laid out  --  a siphon of soda water , and probably a note ; but there would n't be a crumb visible to indicate that Maribelle had labored in the kitchen . Tommy prepared his drink , returned with it to the livingroom , and slumped into a chair . He was really fond of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and she had returned kindness with kindness and humor . Once he left a note asking her if she knew any one who could use a couple of suits he was ready to discard . " I 've got a husband skinney from settin , " she wrote in reply . " He needs new pance bad . " From that time on Tommy 's old clothes went to Maribelle , the Christmas ties , the extra boxes of candy . He paid her what she asked , no more , but at Christmas his present was generous . He hoped Maribelle understood that he gave it out of liking and not for services rendered . The Brahms symphony ended . What was that the announcer was saying ? Ravel 's Bolero ? He scrambled out of his chair and reached for the dial . God , he could n't stand that tonight  --  anything but that . He turned the dial experimentally . Jazz . No , not that either . " We are conquering this depression ? " No , and not the depression or talk about anything @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Just right .... He returned to his chair , sipped his liquor , and tried to relax . Strange , he had always been glad to get back to the apartment before , especially after a busy day . There was  | something comforting about being alone . He always felt as if he were collecting his personality to him again , reassembling himself , slipping back into himself . But now he felt caged . The doors were no longer protecting him from problems and people ; they were shutting him off , barring him in , isolating him . They made everything and every one , like Maribelle , seem doubtful , not quite real . Oh well , he told himself , this was just a mood . He 'd been through a tremendous day , been lifted clean out of himself  --  and then Polly had dropped a brick on his head . It was foolish , though , to be so depressed about her . It would be different if they were in love , but they were n't , never had been , and it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ same , he was going to miss her terribly . There was no denying it ; he would . You did n't find some one like Polly every day  --  not with her brains and her humor . Lord , what good times they 'd had ! He 'd liked pictures long before he knew her , but her passion for them had intensified his liking into a passion equal to hers . The hours they had spent in the galleries , in the Metropolitan ! And how they had fought about Cezanne . That really had been a noble fight . Strange , how long it had taken him to see what she had seen all along . Well , she had been really pig-headed about Sibelius . She could understand Finlandia , but that was all . That kind of music did n't move her , though he had explained and explained , played and played . But she really did care about music , really understood most of it . She could have a grand time at a concert and a grand time at a hockey game . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Oh , damn ! " he cried aloud , jumping to his feet . " Damn ! " There was no use trying to fool himself . He was going to have the devil 's own time trying to get along without Polly . lie needed her ! He needed a woman , her kind of woman . Ile could n't be happy with this girl , that girl , and the other girl . He was n't made that way . He 'd tried it often enough , the Lord knew . Each time he 'd think ? He snapped off  | the thought in disgust . He had fooled himself too many times not to know that he might fool himself again , but he had no desire to contemplate his own weakness . There was no girl there to tempt ; there was nothing but the thought of Polly . And at that moment he wanted her as he had never wanted her before . He wanted Polly Beeman , no one else  --  and somebody named John Bruce was going to have her because he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved her , too . Damn it , he did love her . Of course , he loved her . Did she think that John Bruce loved her more than he did just because he said , " Marry me " ? As if something the city clerk said or maybe some minister or other would make her Bruce 's wife any more than she had been his . He could say , " Marry me , " too . Why not ? He 'd never find another woman like Polly . Never ! He bumped into the davenport in his rush toward the telephone . His finger touched the dial when he noticed that he had brushed a cushion off the davenport to the floor . Ile stared at it . Freda had made the cover for the cushion . He could see her making it , her fair head bent over the green tapestry . The memory made him dizzy . He had tried to take the tapestry out of her hands so that he might kiss her . There had been a little struggle , laughter , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Slowly he lifted his finger from the dial . " No , " he whispered . " No , I could n't  --  not even with Polly . " He dropped to the davenport and held his head in his hands . Freda . . . Could he never forget her ? . . . II The night was bad and the return to the office the next morning almost worse . Yesterday 's excitement was all gone ; the business moved on . It was like the fifth of July , he thought , when he was a youngster ; the quiet was downright  | audible . There was almost a weakness in the let-down , almost sadness in the anticlimax of just living . The roses , more than full-blown now , reminded him of the exploded firecrackers that had littered the walks , and they reminded him too strongly of yesterday . They were n't quite gone . He called the office boy and told him to put them in the reception-room . Then he opened the windows . He wanted the office and his memory washed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Now that I 've got rid of the flowers , maybe I can bury the corpse . " As the day wore on , his depression lightened . There were a hundred threads to pick up , old problems that still needed solving , new ones to be considered . He went to lunch with Frederick Winchester and discussed business , to dinner and later to a prizefight with Teddy . It was late when he returned to his apartment . He tried to read , but soon threw the book aside in disgust with his own inattention . He felt restless and irritable  --  and most irritable with his restlessness . " I 'm foolish , " he told himself sternly . " I ca n't expect to rearrange my life in a day . What I need is sleep . " He did need sleep , but he got far less than he needed . Thoughts whirled around in the darkness , futile , fantastic thoughts that refused to order themselves into ideas . And through all the broken fantasies one thought darted back and forth , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I 'm just where I was four years ago . I 'm just where I was four years ago . I 've got my name on a door and some more money ; that 's all . I 'm just where I was four years ago . " He felt better the next morning , however , and a busy day at the office cleared his mind of worry . Squash with Fred Homans in the afternoon , dinner at the Harvard Club , a movie with some one he met there , kept him occupied and in good spirits . " That 's the idea , " he thought on his way home . " Keep busy . There 's no sense sitting around mooning and feeling sorry for myself . I 've got my work and my friends . There 's  | no need to be lonely . If I give myself plenty of exercise and half a chance , I 'll be settled in a routine before I know it . " But the instant he closed the apartment door behind him , the bleak feeling of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he worked and played hard , it always returned . He could fill his days and evenings with work , exercise , and pleasure , but he could hardly endure the loneliness that descended on him once he had left his companions . At first he had attributed his mood entirely to the loss of Polly , but the arrival of the announcement of her marriage proved to him that the cause went deeper . When he was opening the thick envelopes , Polly had not been in his mind . Thick envelopes were a commonplace in his life . They came from fraternity brothers , college friends , people he met in clubs and in homes . He had read the announcement from Polly without at first taking in its import ; then as the finality of the message reached his consciousness , the curious , unexpected emotion that he was experiencing held him rigid .. " Why , I 'm glad , " he whispered in amazement ; " I 'm just glad . " And he was  --  glad that Polly had had the courage and the wisdom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was he so wretched , so lonely ? He had little sympathy for neurasthenic people and none at all for his own neurasthenia  --  if that was what it was . He did n't know ; but whatever it was , it came from a weakness in him ; of that he felt sure . A healthy-minded man did n't have to have every moment occupied with work or pleasure ; he did n't have to spend every waking moment in association with people . And the kind of introspection he was indulging in was probably unhealthy ; at any rate , it was certainly juvenile . Of course , he was forced to confess , he had suffered like this before . The experience was nothing new . He had known nothing but loneliness for two years and a half , and at that time he had n't expected to know anything else ever again ;  | but he 'd been so numb with pain then , so confused , that he had hardly cared . Then he had met Polly , and before he had realized it , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though  --  and he did care . Before , there had been an understandable reason  --  Freda . All his life he had looked forward with joyous eagerness until he came to New York and left Freda behind . Dreaming , planning , hoping had ended with her , and only hard work had given any significance to his first years in New York . But he could n't place the blame on Freda now , not after a year and a half of contentment with Polly . Did he merely need a woman ? Offended , he rejected the idea instantly . He was n't that much a slave to his body , and he was n't so shallow either that the satisfaction of an appetite alone could make life significant . He could n't ignore the appetite ; it was too strong , too persistent , but he refused to believe that it alone was controlling his life . After all , Polly had been more than a body to him , a thousand times more . There were plenty of women to be had if that was all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to try a cure in which he had no faith . He knew well enough what Polly had meant to him , but he disliked to put his knowledge into words . The fact was complimentary neither to him nor to Polly ; it made him meaningless and made her into something far less than she was in her own right . He could not progress in his thinking , however , until he put the fact into words , and so at last , unwilling and resentful , he formed them in his mind : " Polly was just an escape for me ; that 's all . If I 'd been in love with her , she would n't have served her purpose . As it was , she quieted me and kept me from thinking about Freda and myself . As long as I had her I did n't have to plan . I used her as a kind of narcotic , as an excuse for living . " He thought that over . " An excuse for living ? " No ; that was n't it . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had used her for . He had held her like a shield between him and life .  | Then he paused . Life ? Living ? What did he mean by living , anyway ? What did any one mean by living ? Most people did just what he did  --  worked and played , slept and ate . They earned money and spent it , saved it , lost it , worried , worked , earned more and spent it . Yet most of them seemed to think they were going somewhere ; most of them were terribly earnest about living , and most of them thought they were living . They were always saying , " I 'm going to ? " and went doggedly or gaily , sometimes efficiently , sometimes clumsily , about doing it . Well , he had worked hard and he had got the partnership as a result . What now ? It had been a long time since he had thought , " I 'm going to do ? " well , anything . He had n't thought when he returned to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or dreamed . No , he had merely relaxed and rested . His contentment with Polly had been a false mortar that seemed to connect the bricks of experience that he called his life ; actually , of course , it had n't really been anything but an escape from a purpose , an evasion . He tried to look at himself honestly , and the longer he looked , the less sympathy he had with his loneliness and despair . " I 've got more than most people , " he admitted to himself . " Why , I 've got economic security . I 've always had it . That alone would be enough for millions of people these days . They would think they were in heaven if they had that , and probably they 'd be right , too . Well , I 've got it . I 've got health and strength . That 's more than most people have , too . I can enjoy games , and plenty of people ca n't . I know enough about pictures and music to enjoy them , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ most , too , and lots of them are interesting . What 's more , I 'm not bothered by hones . I can always get away from them . I belong to clubs ; I have more invitations than I can accept . What more does anybody want ? " He did n't know . There was no justification that he could find for his loneliness , and he had no respect for morbidity .  | To him it seemed unhealthy at best , and he suspected that it was the result of timidity and weakness . He read an article in a magazine that asserted that the blues were invariably due to a physical disorder , and so , feeling rather ashamed of himself , he went to a specialist for an examination . It was lengthy , complete . When it was at last over , the doctor said , " Mr. Gray , you come close to being the healthiest specimen I have ever examined . For a professional man , you are in amazingly fine condition . I suspect that you could run a mile in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a good five years younger than you are . I mean that I should think you were twenty-four or five if you had n't told me you were twenty-nine . What was worrying you , anyhow ? " Tommy flushed with embarrassment . " The blues , " he confessed . " I felt all right physically , but I read somewhere that a really healthy man does n't get morbid . I thought I 'd take a chance . " The doctor looked at him keenly . " I 'm not a psychiatrist , Mr. Gray , but I am a diagnostician and I know that a sick mind can live in a healthy body . Your body is healthy . If you are morbid , you probably know the reason and refuse to admit it to yourself . I do n't hold very much with most psychiatric theory , but I do agree that you ca n't remove the cause without discovering it . Maybe you need some one to help you find it , but you look to me like the kind of man who can find it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ confiding in the doctor , though exactly what he had to confide he did not know . Besides , it was his instinct to keep his troubles to himself . Later he thought of that momentary impulse and smiled . Suppose he had said , " Doctor , as near as I can make out , I have pretty nearly everything in the world to make me happy ; but most of the time I 'm lonely and blue and despondent . " Why , the man would have thought he was crazy  --  and with good reason too .  | Or maybe he would have just thought he was a cry-baby , that 's all . " Probably , " thought Tommy , " that 's just what I am  --  but I wonder if there are n't perhaps a lot of cry-babies like me keeping a stiff upper lip in public and feeling all lost and aimless . Maybe not , though . Probably those people know what 's wrong . ... "  | TOMMY liked Mrs. Wallace . She was one client he enjoyed entertaining , and he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But , then , Mrs. Wallace had a gift for pleasure , a zest that he envied . In spite of her sixty years and her widowhood she went gaily into new countries , new experiences , and found something delightful or interesting wherever she went . She and Tommy had seen a good show and then gone to the Waldorf for supper . Now she glanced at her wrist-watch . " I really must go to my room , Mr. Gray , " she said . " I 've had a grand time , but at my age I have to rest if I 'm going to have more grand times . " She smiled at him . " You 're really quite wonderful , you know . No one would think you were just doing a job . You 've made me feel that you 've enjoyed the evening too , and that has added a great deal to my pleasure .

" I know how you must feel , " he went on when the waiter had departed , " and I suppose you think I feel like a gigolo . Well , I do n't . I did n't have to be with you this evening .

" He paused to collect the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I know you 're tired . Shall we go ? " As they made their way through the tables , a bright head caught Tommy 's attention . He had seen hair like that only once before in all his life . It was pale gold , as silky and alive as a child 's hair , and it curled softly at the nape of the woman 's neck . He stared . The woman turned . " Tommy ! " she cried . For the moment he forgot Mrs. Wallace entirely ; the woman held his complete attention . He felt frozen , incapable of thought or movement . The woman , too , was obviously disturbed , but her poise was better than his ; she recovered quickly and held out her hand . Almost automatically , Tommy took it and bowed . There were six people at the table . She presented all of them , but after the first , Tommy heard not a single name . She had said , " My husband , Morton Ballard . " Morton Ballard her husband ? But  --  but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Why , she was ? He acknowledged the introductions mechanically and then said , " I 'm sorry but my guest is waiting . You 'll forgive me ? " bowed again , and hurried after Mrs. Wallace . " I 'm sorry , " he apologized when he found her , " but I was stopped by an  --  an acquaintance . " " It 's quite all right . It 's too bad you left them so quickly . After all , I only have to go to the elevators . How beautiful that girl is ! I do n't think I 've ever seen any one so beautiful . Do you mind telling me who she is ? " " Mrs. Morton Ballard . " " So that 's the girl he married ! I remember there was talk when it happened . She came from upstate somewhere , I  | believe , but I ca n't remember what the talk was . Oh , now I know . It was n't anything against the girl . It was just that everybody was astonished when Morton Ballard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like a child . He must be a great deal older than she is . " Ballard had n't looked old to Tommy , not much over thirty , but his mind was n't really functioning , and , besides , be did n't care anything about comparing ages . " He 's been married before , has n't he ? " he asked because something had to be said . " Yes , eight or nine years ago . His first wife was a Van Orsten . She was a cold , haughty girl . I knew her a little . They never got along , I believe . They were divorced in a year or two and she married an Italian prince . Well , his new wife is lovely , lovely . Have you known her long ? " " Yes , " said Tommy ; " yes , for a long time . " They had reached the elevators . " Goodnight , Mrs. Wallace . I hope you have a pleasant winter in San Diego , and I 'm grateful for a delightful evening . Please @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . " She held out her hand . " And I 'm so glad to believe it . Thank you , Mr. Gray . " Tommy took a taxi home . He wanted quiet to think , and he wanted it as quickly as he could get it . Mrs. Morton Ballard ? How in the world ? And why had n't he heard ? Of course , he 'd seen mention of Ballard 's marriage in the papers , but Ballard had n't meant anything to him and so he had n't read the stories . And where was Oliver Fleming ? What had become of him ? God , how beautiful she was ! He 'd never dreamed it would shake him like this to see her . Once in his apartment , he undressed quickly and got into his pajamas and dressing-gown . He wanted physical freedom for his thoughts  --  freedom from formal thoughts , formal clothes , a stiff collar and a stiffer shirt . Freda ? Freda was Mrs. Morton Ballard ! That was an ermine wrap hanging over the back of her chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it off ! It was perfect . Not one word of explanation , just " Mr. Gray . " And she 'd been just as startled as he had , just as flabbergasted . Oliver or somebody had certainly done a damn fine job of teaching her the tricks . But where was Oliver ? He had n't died ; of that Tommy felt sure . Oliver was rich enough to rate obituaries that could hardly have escaped notice ; besides , there were friends in Albany who would have written . No , Oliver was certainly alive . He was somewhere , and Freda was here in New York ? Mrs. Morton Ballard . How neatly it all worked out . Poor as dirt , just poor , comfortable , rich , very rich . . . . One , two , three , four . . . Just like that ! But who would ever have thought it of Freda ? He fell into a chair and lighted a cigarette . So she was just a gold-digger ! He 'd never guessed that for a moment ? just a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she could certainly climb ; he 'd say that for her . One , two , three , four . . . . She 'd hit the top . The Ballards had everything , the right position uptown and down , in Newport and New York , in Lennox and London . Imagine it ! Little Freda Carlstrom from some hick village in Minnesota wearing the Ballard jewels , swimming at Cannes , taking tea with the Duchess of this and the Princess of that . A revulsion shook him . The honest emotion he had wasted , the tenderness , the pity  --  and the regret ! All of it on a climber . God , what a fool he had been , what a damn , dumb , blind fool . She had seemed so soft and innocent and genuine , so tender and brave , and all the time she was just on her way up . Well , she had made it in three steps , but he wished with fierce intensity that her first step had n't been on his heart . II He had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Freda . On his graduation he had been offered a position  | with an excellent firm in Albany and accepted it . A few months later a new stenographer was engaged . Her name was Freda Carlstrom , and from the moment Tommy saw her he thought she was the loveliest girl in the world . She was , he learned later , four inches over five feet ; but she seemed smaller , there was something so exquisite about her , a manner so gently feminine , so delicate and fine . Her hair was braided and wound in a coronet around her head , but little silken tendrils broke away and curled softly at her temples . From the first Tommy hunted for similes and metaphors to describe her hair . Being no poet , the tropes he found were trite . He compared it to ripe wheat , but no wheat ever held that sheen . He thought of it as palest gold , but gold was metallic and hard , and Freda 's hair was soft magic . Honey ? Yes , but honey suggested something all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that hair ; it was uniquely beautiful , uniquely her own . Her features were small , prettily shaped , her eyes very blue with brown lashes . And she used neither rouge nor lipstick . It would have been a crime against all beauty , Tommy thought , to hide the rose pink of her cheeks or the deeper pink of her lips under cosmetics , and he admired the taste that made her refrain . Soon after he knew her he told her so , and she replied naively , " It is n't that . I know I look country this way , but I ca n't afford rouge . " She could n't afford to have her long braids bobbed , either . Bobbing meant haircuts , and she had to have stockings . Tommy 's capitulation was immediate and complete . Her beauty captured him ; her directness and simplicity held him . She had been born , she said , in Minnesota . Her grandparents had been Swedish immigrants , farmers with no thought other than toil and no aspiration greater than ownership of their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , going from place to place , changing from job to job , going everywhere and getting nowhere . When she was fourteen her mother had died , worn out with poverty and  | discouragement . She never talked much about what happened then . Evidently her father , never too reliable , had taken to drink . For no reason that she understood they came to Albany , and for no reason they stayed there . Sometimes her father worked ; sometimes he did n't , but by some miracle of effort and economy she managed to graduate from high school . That had been two years before . She had gone to work immediately as a waitress and found herself supporting her father . She was determined to escape into something better . She was never able to explain her determination ; it seemed only a blind instinct . It was like her cleanliness , as much a part of her as her voice or eyes . Sometimes Tommy thought it was her yearning for cleanliness that had driven her forward , her need to live in surroundings as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a year her father baffled her ; then one night , more drunk even than usual , he fell under an automobile . His death was a release for Freda , and she never pretended that she thought it was anything else . In the next year she worked as a waitress during the days and attended a secretarial school at night . She felt , she said , that she had reached heaven when she was accepted as a real stenographer in the firm for which Tommy worked . Well , said Tommy , if the offices were heaven , she had arrived where she belonged , because if ever there was an angel on earth , she was it . Freda had smiled and shaken her lovely head . No , she was n't anything like that , but it was awfully good to get away from the steamy kitchen and the tough talk of the other waitresses , though they 'd always been nice to her . And it was wonderful to work sitting down ; her feet used to get awfully tired . And waitresses ' feet @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Well , they did , and she hated to think of hers flattening out that way . Tommy was wooing her long before he was consciously aware of being in love . Her humble ancestry , her workworn  | mother and drink-sodden father never mattered to him . So far as he was concerned , Freda had no past existence before he met her . She merely was in all her adorable simplicity , her flowerlike beauty . When he asked her to marry him , she at first refused . His surprise was complete , and there was no vanity in it . He had built a mansion of dreams around her , and it was so real to him that he could not believe that it was n't real to her , too . It seemed as if she must have dreamed the same dreams . " I could n't , " she said shyly . " Oh , I could n't . " " But why not , Freda ? Why not ? Do n't you love me at all ? " " It is n't that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mean ? " She stumbled hopelessly , the pink in her cheeks deepened to the warmest rose , and her eyes shone with tears . Finally she whispered , " You 'd be ashamed of me . " " Ashamed of you ! " Ashamed of her ? Of the loveliest , sweetest girl the world had ever seen ? How could she think such a thing ? Whatever had made her think it ? " Ashamed of you ? " he repeated . " Why , I 'd be so proud of you I 'd bust . Freda darling , have n't you any idea how lovely you are ? Do n't you know you 're brave and beautiful and honest and fine ? Well , you are . How could anybody be ashamed of you ? What is there to be ashamed of ? " She met his incredulous stare unwaveringly . " I 'm nobody , " she explained softly . " My grandparents spoke funny English , all of them , and my mother did , too , sometimes . ' I bane , ' you know @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in awful places , and I do n't know about nice people . I just know about waitresses and the men who ate in that restaurant , and you do n't know how tough they were . Why , ? " " That 's nonsense ! " he broke in hotly . " You 're a brave girl who 's worked her way up , and I 'm proud of you for doing it . Any halfway decent man would be . And what do we care about your grandmother ? I do n't want to marry her .  | I want to marry you . And you know all about nice people because you 're nice yourself , the nicest person I 've ever met  --  lots the nicest . " She shook her head . " No , I do n't know about being nice . I  --  I do n't know about forks and things like that . Oh , I want to be nice . I do . I do . I want to more than anything in the world . I love nice things . You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lingers caressed the sleeve of the silk blouse she was wearing , and she smiled shyly . " I love this . It is n't very nice , I guess , but it 's the nicest one I ever had , and I love it . But you 've always had nice things , you see , and you know nice people  --  lawyers and professors and people like that . I would n't know how to act , and I do n't know about books and things . You 'd be ashamed of me , and it 'd be awful . " Tommy took her hands in his and pleaded with her . " Listen to me , sweetheart ; please listen . The things you do n't know about do n't matter . Forks ? We 'll buy all the kinds of forks there are and use them every day until you pick up the right one without looking . We 'll buy the right books and go to the right shows . I 'll help you if you 'll let me . You would let me , would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cried . " Oh , would you really ? " " Would I ? Would I ? Why , I 'll be a regular schoolmarm . I 'll be a walking book of etiquette , though I do n't know so much about etiquette , at that . But I can pull off this kind of thing all right ; you know , like this : Darling , a lady does n't need to rise to greet a man , but I think it 's nice of her to do it if the man is her guest  --  but she ought to rise always to greet an older woman . ' How 's that ? Let 's see . . . Oh , yes . She may offer her hand to a man or not , just as she wishes . When making an afternoon call , she leaves three cards  --  one for herself and two for her husband . ' I remember my mother always used to do that and I thought it was cuckoo . There 's nothing to learn but a few things like that ? honestly @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ "  | She studied him earnestly and then asked again , " You 'll really teach me ? " " I will , darling ; I will . " " And you wo n't laugh at me when I make mistakes ? " " You wo n't make mistakes , and I 'd cut my hand off before I 'd laugh at you . " " And you 'll try not to be ashamed ? I do n't think I 'm very smart , you see , and maybe ? " But by then Tommy knew that he had won and he stopped her questions with kisses . They were married a month later as quietly and unobtrusively as possible and went to Lake George on their honeymoon . They came back to settle down in the four-room apartment that Freda furnished with such fear and care . Tommy was touched by her rapture . She seemed to have a deep , passionate love for every chair , picture , dish , and spoon in the apartment . And he was touched , too , by her childlike devotion to him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as Apollo , as wise as Jove . She came to him with her social problems and listened , frowning with concentration , to his explanations . She learned quickly , deferred to his taste in everything ; and being both modest and beautiful , she won her way into his particular group so easily that she was suspicious of her success . " They 're just nice to me on account of you , " she said in her frank , self-distrustful way . " Nonsense , darling ! " Tommy reassured her . " You ought to hear what they say about you to me . If one person has told me you 're beautiful and sweet , twenty have . They all love you . Nobody could help loving you . And you know I do , do n't you ? You do know it , do n't you ? " She had gone to his arms then , whispering , " Tommy , oh , Tommy . . . . " A month of perfection passed and a second month . The problem of forks had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to books , music , and pictures .  | Then there were some difficulties  --  not important ones , they seemed to Tommy , but difficulties . Patience was needed , he told himself repeatedly , patience , patience . He could n't expect Freda to learn in a month or six months what had taken him twenty-five years . Besides , why should n't she like popular songs better than Schubert 's ? He liked popular songs himself sometimes ; but he had been well educated in music , and her indifference to even the simpler classics baffled him . He was a good pianist , and he felt that he must bring some understanding of really beautiful music to her . Her singing voice was better than his , sweet and true , and he dreamed of accompanying her while she sang for their friends . He could see people admiring her , wondering at her beauty and gifts . It was a dream that could come true , that must come true . Freda sang whenever he asked her to and whatever he asked her to , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the walls were his , and she believed they were good because he said they were . He took her to New York to the Metropolitan and walked her up and down corridors for hours while he lectured earnestly on Raphael and Leonardo , Constable and Gainsborough , Memling and Rubens . She trudged after him , listened intently , and said nothing . Finally he asked her what she thought of a Rembrandt . " Should I like it ? " she asked . " It seems awfully old and kind of dirty  --  not nice and clean like Maxfield Parrish 's pictures . I love them . " Because he wanted her to be perfect , Tommy was irritated . But only for an instant . Understanding came before he gave any sign of his disappointment . He had no right to he superior . After all , every one had to pass through the Parrish stage . He had had three Maxfield Parrish prints in his room in college , and he had had them there because he had thought them beautiful . And lots of people @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were popular . Freda might have a lot worse taste .  | She read the books that he asked her to read , but he knew that she enjoyed few of them  --  and she did n't quite see why she should enjoy them . She was very careful of her speech , eternally wary of her grammar , but the books Tommy selected bored her . She could n't understand why he found them enthralling or why he scorned the books she really enjoyed . She showed her confusion but made no effort to defend her taste . She took it for granted that it was bad . Her very pliancy began to make Tommy afraid . If she had stood up to him and defended herself , he would have accepted her for what she was and made the best of it ; but she had no faith in herself and absolute faith in him . He knew everything ; she knew nothing . She was utterly humble and almost pathetically eager for him to make her into whatever he wanted her to be . He tried to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ after three months a strain came into their relationship that cast a shadow on the happiness that had been so marvelously bright . Yet it had never occurred to Tommy that his marriage was anything but a success until Oliver Fleming came to him and said with surprising candor , " I want to talk to you about Freda . " Oliver was thirty , a bachelor , and an esthete . He made a fetish of fine and delicate living . Tall , slender , perfectly dressed , with his unusual refinement showing both in his face and his manner , he succeeded somehow in suggesting perfect culture without giving a hint of effeminacy or preciousness . He had inherited thirty thousand a year and saw no reason for adding to an income so ample , and so he pursued a number of artistic hobbies and found apparently complete satisfaction in them . Tommy had met Oliver soon after his arrival in Albany , and , although they were very different in temperament he enjoyed knowing him and felt that he had learned a great deal from him . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Oliver had been very kind to her , and she had accepted  | him with unexpected ease . Of all his acquaintances , Tommy had thought that Oliver would frighten her most . " Freda ? " Tommy asked . " Why , what about her ? " Oliver smoothed his gloves over his knee and then looked up . " I hate emotional messes . I 've never been in one , and I 've come to you because I do n't want to get into one . Besides , I like to think of myself as an honorable man . I am going to tell you exactly what I think and how I feel . If you tell me my assumptions are wrong , I promise you that this conversation will be the end of the matter . " " Honestly , " Tommy said , " I have n't an idea what you are talking about . " " I suppose not , but , you see , Tommy , I 've been more or less outside of life always . I 've kept myself apart . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ interest in other people 's lives . I 've become , I believe , rather unusually sensitive to atmospheres . In the last few months I 've felt a strain in your house . Every time I come I feel it more ; I feel the strain in Freda . " He held up his hand . " Wait , please . I know you are angered , but hear me out . I 'm not intruding because I want to . You must know me well enough to understand that . Please listen . . . I 've studied Freda for months now . I have thought about hardly anything else , and I 've become convinced that you and she can never be happy together . It is n't your fault or hers . You 've both tried , and Freda has tried too hard . Her spirit is breaking ; she is acquiring a sense of inferiority that will eventually wreck her  --  wreck both of you . And I 've come to you because I think I understand her  --  and , well , Tommy , because @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pain , and rage . He was only twenty-five years old and for a few months he had known happiness even beyond his dreams , and he still dreamed of capturing that happiness again . He felt no diminution in his love for Freda , and he had not been consciously aware of any in her love for him . They could still  | find rapture together , rapture that erased all the strain and made such things as books , pictures , and music seem of less than no significance . Hot words rose to his lips , broke forth . He denied everything that Oliver Fleming had said , accused him of having made love to Freda , called him a liar and a false friend , and declared passionately that nothing in the world would make him give Freda up . Oliver 's pale skin flushed and his lips quivered . Long after , Tommy realized a little of how much Oliver had suffered during that interview , but at the moment he had no understanding of him and no pity for him . Tommy knew how to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ primitive desire to use them on Oliver , but it would have been like striking Freda . Oliver did not know how to fight and would not have fought even if he had known how . No emotion could strip him of his civilization , of his control . He heard Tommy out and then said gently , " I 'm sorry , Tommy  --  I give you my word , I 'm sorry . But everything you say is wrong , and down in your heart you know it is . I admit you 've tried , but you 're temperamentally incapable of understanding Freda . You must know that you do n't understand her . The child 's miserable , filled with a sense of futility and failure . I told you I was in love with her . I am . But remember , Tommy , I have n't told Freda . If you say so , I 'll take the next boat to Europe  --  but think it over before you say so . " He got up . " Do n't damn me , Tommy , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some day you 'll thank me . " Tommy took a long walk . He had to be by himself . He had to think . But he could n't think . He could only feel and fear . Eventually he thought he was sufficiently in control of himself to face Freda . His hand trembled when he inserted the key in the lock of the apartment house door . He had no feeling of anger now ; nothing remained but terror . He looked at Freda and then looked away . Oliver had  | opened his eyes , and in a single glance he saw too much . He saw Freda 's weariness , the child-like contrition that seemed to envelop her . It was agony for him to speak , but he lacked the courage to delay speaking . And so , with his voice so husky and broken that his words were hardly intelligible , he asked her if she was happy . Her lips trembled and her blue eyes filled with tears . Tommy needed no other answer . He left the room . Later they talked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not failed . Six months , he said passionately , meant nothing ; it was absurd to think that six months could mean anything . There were years before them , all their lives . How could she think she had failed when he had been so happy ? If he had been harsh or impatient , he was sorry . Maybe he had asked too much . If he had , everything was his fault . Besides , he loved her . She knew he loved her , did n't she ? Sadly , she exonerated him of all guilt . He had been wonderful . The fault was all hers . She was stupid and common , and that was all there was to it . Tommy cried angry denials , but he could not touch her conviction that she was n't fit for his kind of life . Fearfully he asked her if she knew that Oliver was in love with her . Yes , she knew . He had n't said anything , but she could n't help knowing . Then because ignorance was more terrifying than @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ loved Oliver . She did n't know  --  oh , she did n't know . Tommy tried hard and in all honesty to show her that marriage with Oliver would be far harder for her than with him . Oliver , he said truthfully , cared a thousand times more for books and the arts than he did ; Oliver was a thousand times more sensitive ; his standards were a thousand times higher . She admitted everything , but Tommy could not fail to see that she had some kind of faith in Oliver that he had failed to kindle . She seemed to feel that Oliver understood  | something essential  --  something that she could not put into words but which was basically , fundamentally important . Tommy was beaten , but he did n't know it ; for two weeks he struggled . He could n't give up his happiness ; he simply could not . Then one day it occurred to him that it had already been taken away from him , that there was no longer any question of losing it ; it was already lost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Freda to make whatever arrangements they wished . Numb , unthinking , incapable of thought , he merely stood aside . Fortunately the offer from Winchester , Winchester , and Tucker came just in time to save him the embarrassment and humiliation of making explanations to his Albany acquaintances . He accepted the offer immediately . Freda remained in Albany until he was free to go to New York . That same day she left for Reno . Three months later he noticed in a New York paper that Mr. and Mrs. Oliver Fleming were sailing on the Berengaria for France . They were spending their honeymoon abroad . That was the last Tommy had heard of Freda or from her until the accidental meeting in the Waldorf . Now she was wearing ermine , diamonds and sapphires ; she was Mrs. Morton Ballard . Well , maybe she would stay Mrs. Morton Ballard ; she could hardly aim higher . The first few months following the separation had been blind , nerve-shattering agony . He had loved Freda so fiercely , tried so hard , that he could not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did n't know why she had . Oliver ? What was her faith in him ? She had said she was too common ; yet she had left a healthy animal like him to go to an esthete who approached every act with the critical care of an artist putting paint on canvas . Round and round his thoughts went in the same futile circles until loneliness and despair made all thoughts impossible . In losing Freda he had lost all his plans , all his dreams  --  everything but his hunger for her . That remained , ever present , never satisfied .  | Until he met Polly Beeman he could find meaning in nothing but work ; otherwise life had no zest for him , no sting . With Polly he had at last found a kind of peace , a rest from pain . Now Polly was in Cambridge married to another man , and Freda whom he had loved and for whom he had suffered had turned out to be nothing but an amazingly agile climber . He shook with rage . For the first time in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his gorge rise . He had worshiped that girl , trembled  --  literally trembled  --  at her touch , at her beauty and sweetness . She had seemed to him more angel than human . Angel ? That was a good one ! Well , Oliver had been right , though he 'd never believed it before ; he had n't understood her . But , by God , neither had Oliver . What a shock he must have got . She was the lowest kind of low-class slut  --  but she had certainly taken two good men for a ride . III Though at the time he did not in the least realize it , it was the meeting with Freda that made him turn when he saw Harriet Carrington on Madison Avenue the following Saturday afternoon . Usually he would have been glad that Harriet had not seen him and gone quickly on his way . He had seen her often in the days before he met Polly , and he had been willing enough to forget her . She was a lawyer , well known to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forefront of all movements for the advancement of women , and in the courtroom she showed a shrewdness and an implacable aggressiveness that had intimidated more than one male opponent . Her quiet sarcasm was famous , her cold , cutting contempt . Her skin was dark , her features sharp , her hips far too broad for her narrow shoulders , but she dressed so well that most people thought of her as a rather handsome and certainly as a distinguished-looking  | woman . Her age was a secret , but Tommy suspected that she would not again see thirty-five . He turned . " Harriet , " he said ; " Harriet Carrington . " She glanced over her shoulder , stopped at once , and held out her hand . " Why , Tommy Gray . It 's been literally years , I think . I supposed you had left the city . " Tommy knew perfectly what she was thinking and so he evaded neatly by saying , " Do n't make me feel guilty , Harriet . I have a New England conscience , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ leave it alone , shall we ? Tell me , how are you doing and how are you feeling ? " " Splendidly , thank you , to both questions . You look so well that I need n't ask . Instead , suppose I ask if I 'm ever going to see you again ? " " There you go taking a jab at my conscience . I knew you would . " Tommy grinned at her and received a pleased smile in return . " You 're going to see me just as soon as you 'll see me . I 'm supposed to be one of a thousand or two at a shindig at the Ritz tonight , but I sha n't be missed if I do n't turn up . Want to break a date to have a date with me ? " " No . Or , rather , yes , but I ca n't . I 've got to go to a meeting I ca n't avoid . " Ah , the old game was on , Tommy thought . One always had to play @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the game was new , that they had never played it before with each other . They would be just pleasant acquaintances who happened to meet , happened to make an engagement , happened to return to her apartment for drinks and conversation  --  and then , ah then ! Then the flesh deceived them . After all these years , Tommy thought , Harriet ought to be a little suspicious of flesh so consistently unreliable , but her faith was so perfect that she never escaped the joy of seduction . If he even hinted that what would certainly happen might happen , she would be outraged .  | Her dignity must be protected with social subterfuge . Therefore after a great deal of needless conversation it was agreed that Tommy was to call for her at eleven o'clock . They would go to a night club , see the midnight show , and then , they both pretended to believe , they would call it a pleasant evening . The next afternoon Tommy sat in his own apartment and damned himself for a fool . " Now , why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ start something with Harriet ? I knew what she was like . I was well rid of her , and I knew I was ; now I 'll have to get rid of her all over again . " Her coyness in love , he thought , was as sickening as her mental dishonesty was unforgivable . Harriet Carrington the lawyer was hard and keen and admirably realistic ; Harriet Carrington the woman was sentimental and deceptive and unrelentingly selfish . She was so afraid that she might love a man enough to lose her emotional independence that she gave nothing . Yet she expected everything . And if he met her an hour hence she would pretend that last night had never happened . Once more they would be merely pleasant acquaintances . Oh , to hell with women like her ! He knew well enough , however , that his feeling of disgust was more for himself than for Harriet . She would not bother him . If he did n't want to see her again , he did n't have to . And he was the one who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made the engagement with his eyes wide open . He had known well enough what to expect . There had been an opportunity and he had taken it . He had no one but himself to blame . Besides , he always felt depressed and self-condemnatory after a casual affair . He wondered why . There was n't any reason that he should n't have casual affairs if he wanted them . He hurt nobody . There was nobody to hurt . The last thread that had tied him to Freda was severed now , and if he 'd thought he was hurting her by spending a night with  | Harriet , he was fooling himself , that 's all . She would n't give a small-sized damn what he did last night , tonight , or any other time . Nobody would give a small-sized damn . Then ! ! Why in God 's name did he feel so low ? It was n't conscience ; he felt sure of that . Conscience had nothing to do with it . His conscience , he told himself , did n't trouble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Fred Homans ' did him , and they played around with one girl alter another . Yet he felt something close to shame , a kind of despair with himself . There had been no joy in his night with Harriet , only a kind of fierce feeding of an appetite that had been too long denied . With Polly there had been joy ; with Freda there had been . But never with any other woman . Was he never to know that joy again ? Must he always have this feeling of having broken faith with him-self ? A sexual experience was n't that important . It was absurd to say it was . Miserably he ran his hand through his hair and shook his head . It was to him ; there was no denying it , it was to him . Maybe he lacked the pagan spirit , maybe he was an idealist ; he did n't know . But he did know that he was so made that he could not take physical intimacy happity unless he shared something that might be called a spirtual intimacy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her , trust her deeply , and feel sure that she shared the trust . Once in marriage he had found it and once outside of marriage . Despairingly he wondered if he would ever find it again . If he failed he was doomed to more nights with Harriet or with women like her . There was no sense in fooling himself . This depressed mood , this hour of honesty with himself , would pass and once more he would find himself undone by his hunger  --  once more depressed , once more for an hour honest . Suddenly , thought , control left him . He leaped to his feet and strode wildly up and down the room . Muttering the words , he cursed Freda ; damned her with obscene epithets  | for what she had done to his life , done to him , made of him . He was n't reasoning any longer , seeking explanations or evasions . The words came from his emotions , and his emotions had no need to seek for understanding ; they knew . After the meeting in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of the Harriet incident , which might well have made him dubious , he thought he was going to succeed . Loathing was likely to prove a lot better mental eraser than regret and longing had been . One instinctively put people one loathed out of mind . He was busy with a client when an office boy entered and handed him an envelope . Tommy made the necessary apologies and opened it . The note was brief : " Dear Tommy , Please see me . It 's important . Freda . " He stared at her business college handwriting ; felt his face burn , his heart pound ; and tried hard for composure . " If it 's something important , " said the client , " I 'll go now . " He glanced at his watch . " I really ought to go , anyway . When would you like to finish this ? " Tommy suggested a date , noted it on his calendar , shook hands , and watched the door close after the caller . Then as if shot upward by @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his feet and raced back and forth across the office with tight , quick steps . He could n't see her ! He would n't see her ! What had made her come here ? Could n't she leave him alone ? That was all he was asking : to be left alone , and it was little enough . Suddenly the tenseness left him and he felt weak and impotent . He walked to the window and stared down at the traffic . He did n't want to see Freda , but what could he do ? What would he accomplish if he sent out word that he was too busy ? Not a thing . He 'd hurt her perhaps , but there would n't be much satisfaction in that . Besides , he had no desire to hurt her ; he just wanted to forget that  | she 'd ever lived . She was waiting in the reception-room ... . He turned , shrugging his shoulders . " Oh , hell , " he thought , " what difference does it make , anyway ? " He picked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in , please ? " In the old days her beauty had always come to him as a surprise . If he merely walked out of the room where she was sitting and returned two minutes later , her beauty startled him . Now it was a shock . It had attained perfection . She was wearing a woolen suit that even to a man suggested Paris . So did her small hat , her purse . And there were sables on her shoulders . She walked to his desk , but did not offer her hand . " I had to come , " she said . " I had to explain . " Tommy 's throat felt painfully constricted . There was a pulse beating that seemed to echo all through his body . He managed to motion to a chair . She looked at him , then sat down . He was glad to sink into his own chair and feel its firmness under him . " Yes ? " he asked softly . She bit her lips to keep them quiet . Tommy saw her hand tremble @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she spoke . " I know I embarrassed you the other night , " she began , " and I 'm terribly sorry . I should n't have spoken ; I know that , of course , but I was so surprised that I spoke without thinking . " Her nervousness gave him assurance , and sudden , new anger gave him poise . " I understood that , " he said with cold politeness . " There is no need for an apology . " She placed her purse on the desk , rested her hand on it , and studied him . She was , he knew , only twenty-five , and she looked hardly older than she had when he first knew her ; but she had changed . The timidity had gone . She was nervous now , but it was the situation that upset her , not the old lack of faith in herself . " I do n't blame you for speaking that way , " she said at last . " I expected you to , and I know what you think . I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's why I 've come . I  | do n't care whether any one in the world understands but you , but you 've got to . I can never have a day 's happiness until I know you understand . " The hand on the purse trembled , and her blue eyes grew bright with tears . " You 'll let me explain , wo n't you , Tommy ? " Her emotion angered him further . He did n't believe in it  --  not after her poise in the Waldorf . Once upon a time ? yes , but not now . She was putting on some kind of act . His anger showed in his eyes , in the soft intensity of his voice . " I do n't know what you can have to explain to me . The explanations were over long ago . If you want my congratulations you have them . " " Tommy , please ! " Her voice broke and her hand moved toward him imploringly . " Oh , please . Please give me a chance . Be kind @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ You do n't know how important this is to me . " Tommy looked at her long with his anger and contempt clear in his eyes . " I do n't know whether I can be kind or not , Freda , " he said , measuring his words . " When I saw you with your new husband , I 'm afraid I lost my kindly feelings . " " I knew you had ! I knew it ! That 's why you must listen . " She leaned forward and spoke rapidly as if she feared he would leave her before she said what she must say . " I know what you think , what anybody would think . Oh , listen , Tommy ! I 'm not what you think I am . I 'm not bad . I 'm not ! You wanted me to be something I just could n't be when  --  when we  --  when we were married ; you kept pretending I was something I was n't . I tried to be it for you . You do n't know how hard @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ forever if you 'd really wanted me to , but you did n't . You know you did n't . You liked to look at me and  --  and sleep with me , but that was all . You know it was . And you would n't admit it , but down in your heart you thought I was vulgar and common . You tried to hide it , but I could see . I thought I was common too , but I could n't bear to  | have you think it . And I could n't help loving all the beautiful things . You did n't know what they meant to me . You thought it was stupid to love things that way . You did n't understand ; you did n't understand a bit . And you were jealous of them . You thought I loved the things more than I did you . " His face remained so stern that she dropped her hands into her lap with a movement of utter defeat . " You 're not trying to understand ! " " Yes , I am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'm trying , and I know there is some truth in what you say . I do n't know how much , and I do n't know why you bring it up now . But I 'm willing to listen . I am listening . Go on . " She studied him fearfully , breathed deeply , and then continued . " I have to bring it up . You 'll see why . You see , Tommy , things meant so much to me because I 'd never had them . I never could believe I did have them . I still ca n't . And I did n't like the things you did . I tried and tried to , but I could n't  --  and I knew you despised the things I liked . When I made myself into a stenographer , I felt proud ; but you took all my pride away  --  and the kinder you were , the more ashamed I felt . Can you understand that ? " Tommy felt his sternness slipping from him , his anger , and he tried to cling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . It was his only defense , but he could n't hate this beautiful girl whom he had once loved so tenderly . Besides , it hurt to learn that he had stolen her pride . " I think I understand , " he said , his voice rough with his emotion . " I 'm trying . Go on . " Freda noted the change in him and spoke with more assurance . " Oliver understood all that . He explained it to me before I could explain it to myself . That 's why I trusted him . And I was n't afraid of hurting him . I knew I could n't hurt him , and I 'd hurt you terribly . That was the worst thing . I just could n't go on hurting you . I did n't care for him like I did for you , and he knew it , but I was lost ,  | Tommy ; I did n't know what to do  --  and he did understand . He always understood . He understands everything . Sometimes I think he understands too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that was to me , and he was having a grand time . That was a comfort too . " She smiled reminiscently and shook her head . " He was more like a teacher than a husband , and it was the teaching he enjoyed . He  --  he is n't very emotional . He took me to Europe and we stayed there more than two years , and he trained me . He said he was modeling perfection . Once he told me a story about Pygmalion and Galatea . You know it ? " Tommy nodded . " Well , that 's the way he felt , I think ; anyway , it 's the way he made me feel . Sometimes I really did feel almost like a statue . But he was always kind and gentle and understanding . He even understood my liking for things , though he said I liked the wrong things , and he tried to teach me what the right ones were . He says I can give the right lipservice now in the right spots every time , but it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in a way we were happy ? not really happy , you know , but he was doing something he liked to do , and I loved going places and seeing things and having lovely clothes and things like that . Besides , Oliver can be lots of fun . " Then he got tired of it . He said he had failed , but that be had enjoyed trying . Do you know what he said ? He said , Freda , you 'll always be a beautiful little Swede with common tastes , but I 'm the only person in the world who 'll ever guess it ! ' And he said it was time I went back to the emotional life I was fit for . Morton was in love with me , and , of course , Oliver knew it . He practically arranged our marriage  --  Honestly ! He said Morton was the one man in the world to make me happy and that I was absolutely perfect for Morton . Nobody is as pleased about the whole thing as Oliver . " Tommy could n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sense of release from his hatred of Freda . He had cherished the hatred , he thought , but he was letting it slip away unnoticed and uncared for . " That sounds just like him , " he said . " The whole thing sounds like him . I never could believe that he was capable of falling in love with anything more animate than a statue , and now you 've explained everything . " Suddenly he leaned forward and asked sharply , urgently , " Do you love Ballard ? " " Yes . " The answer was quick and direct . " That 's what I wanted to tell you . And he loves me  --  not the way Oliver did , the way you did , I mean . And , Tommy , I 'm going to tell you something . I would n't say it to anybody else , but I must to you . Oliver knows , of course . Morton and I are just alike . He went to Groton and Harvard and had tutors and trips abroad , but underneath he 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tracks . " She laughed at Tommy 's start of surprise . " Oh , yes , we are . We both know all the tricks and we show them off for people , but alone we 're ourselves . " She leaned forward , a little smile twitching at her lips . " Tommy , I 'll tell you something that 'll make you sick . You gave me cotton sheets and I thought they were wonderful . Oliver gave me linen sheets and I loved them so I thought I could eat them . But " ? she paused and giggled like a child ? " Morton gives me satin sheets ! " " Satin ! " cried Tommy , all rural New England in his voice . " Yes , satin , " she repeated , openly delighted with the effect she had produced . " Satin , and he likes them just as much as I do . And he bought me a negligee with more lace and feathers on it than anything you ever saw , and I have mules with feathers on them too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ grow bluer as she smiled . " Sometimes when nobody 's around I put on an evening dress I 've got . Oh , you would hate it . It has n't any back and not much front , and it 's satin too  --  pink satin . Then Morton puts all the family jewels on me  --  all of them , the diamonds and emeralds  | and sapphires and pearls , all of them at once . I just blaze . You would throw a fit if you could see me , and Oliver would faint . But nobody sees me . Just Morton and me ; that 's all . I 'm just right for other people , but alone we 're nice and common . " " And that 's all he asks ? " said Tommy wonderingly . " Is n't that being a model all over again  --  different from the kind Oliver wanted , but just a model , all the same ? " She shook her head in the old negative gesture that he remembered so well . She always seemed like a little @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ side to side . " No . We 're happy together . There 's lots of things we like to do together . Besides , I run his house , remember , and entertain for him  --  and I know how to do it now , Tommy . " She hesitated and then spoke with deep seriousness . " There 's one thing that matters a lot to Morton , and that 's the family . He wants children  --  and he 's going to have them , all he wants . I 'm  --  I 'm  --  well , in six months now . " Tommy looked at her a long time without saying anything . She had turned his feeling toward her upside down so quickly that he found it difficult to put his new attitude into words . And another emotion clouded his mind , an emotion strong in its newness , stronger in its memories . The loveliest woman . . . He blinked his eyes , tried to bring his mind into control . " Freda , " he said at last , his voice deep @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in coming . I know that you came for the sake of your pride , but you 've done a lot for mine too . I 'm too confused right now to explain ; besides , it does n't matter . All that matters is that you cleaned all the bitterness out of me . And I think I admire you more than I ever have . I 'll have to think it out , but somehow I know right now that you 've done the brave and honest thing every time . I 'm glad you 're happy . I 'm surprised , awfully surprised , but ? " His telephone rang . " Yes ? " he said .  | It was Mae Vadney . " If you 're free , Mr. Jonathon would like to see you in his office . It 's rather important . " " Right away , " he assured her and turned to Freda . " I 'm sorry , " he explained , " but I have to turn into a business man again . " She stood up and held out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , you know how I feel , I think . I told Morton I was coming and why . If we happen to meet , Tommy , ca n't we be friends ? " He pressed her hand and looked long into her eyes . " Freda , " he said , " you can always , always count on one thing : we are friends . "  | THAT night Tommy did not find his apartment empty : it was filled with the company of his thoughts . Amazing Freda ! And amazing Oliver ! How easily he could imagine those two standing before The Birth of Venus . He could hear Oliver asking  --  oh , ever so gently , " Now , my dear , what do you find interesting in that picture ? " And ten to one Freda answered , " The funny feet . " Well , thought Tommy , they were funny feet , but Oliver would ignore them . Or , more likely , he said , " Keep them a secret , Freda ; keep them a secret . When some one @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ wonderful . Remember that  --  Botticelli 's wonderful line . " And probably Freda frowned in her earnest way and murmured over and over again , " Botticelli 's wonderful line , Botticelli 's wonderful line . " If Oliver had done his job as well as Tommy suspected he had , Freda responded to key words as automatically and accurately as an electrically controlled robot . But the chances were that she understood more and appreciated more than Oliver ever gave her credit for . Oliver 's standards were fit only for Oliver , and that morning 's interview had taught Tommy that Freda 's mind was far from as simple as he had always believed it . He had never dreamed that she had a sense of humor , an understanding of the ridiculous . Why , she had fun in her , a world of fun . " Oliver and I just got her ready for Ballard , that 's all , " he thought grumblingly . That dressing up business . . . Oliver went a whole lot too far if he made her think she really @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She always liked quiet clothes , and jewels did n't mean half as much to her as linen napkins  | and silk underwear . No , that dressing up was just a performance  --  a rebellion from too much Oliver . . . . He supposed Ballard was probably rebelling from an Oliver-like family . Or , what was even more likely , Oliver had put Ballard up to the whole business because he thought Freda would enjoy it . Well , she did enjoy it ; so the reason did n't make any difference at all . But what a story Freda 's life made ! It was really wonderful . Why , she had been brought up like a gypsy , dragged around by that drunken father of hers , but she 'd wanted something , wanted it hard ; and in spite of hell and high water , she 'd got it . It seemed as if she had gone steadily toward it guided only by some kind of instinct like a cat finding its way home . Nothing had stopped her , not poverty , nor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she had ever known what she wanted ; he doubted that even now she could formulate in words the yearning that had driven her ever forward , but she had had some kind of guiding star that she had followed straight to her goal . Her life was polarized . Maybe that was the wrong way to put it , but he knew exactly what he meant . Her life had always been polarized ; she did n't need ambition or religion or even acquisitiveness as a guide . She had instinctive direction , a subconscious purpose that led her on to the something that constituted happiness for her . He believed that she was really happy and that she would be happy . She had lost fear and found humor . Surely that indicated happiness if anything did . And he was glad  --  completely , surprisingly glad . Oliver 's careful training had n't touched her sweetness ; wealth had n't affected her honesty . She was the old Freda  --  free at last . ! low lovely she was , lovelier than ever . He ran his fingers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to tease him . The loveliest thing in the world . . . . Even today there in the office , even while he was listening with all his might , even when he thought he hated her , he 'd been  | conscious every minute of her loveliness . Why , she could take him like that  --  any time she wanted to . . . . He slapped the arm of his chair . That kind of thinking would n't do . The first thing ? No , he must n't think that way . Forget that ! Where was he , anyhow ? He 'd been getting somewhere , getting at something important  --  important to him . . . There 'd been a word . . . . He must think about that , that word . . . What was it ? The word . that 'd popped into his head about Freda ? Magnetism ? No  --  no , polarization . That was it ; he 'd thought of Freda 's life as polarized . And his was n't . That was the trouble . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't know where he was going . It was something to make a man crawl , that talk with Freda . Here he was with a better mind than hers , a thousand times better background , a million times the opportunities  --  he 'd had everything , and the best he could do was chase his tail in a crazy circle , while Freda went straight toward what she wanted . Seven years of college  --  four at Dartmouth and three at Harvard  --  had n't even taught him what to want . Though he 'd thought in those days that he knew , he 'd be damned now if he could even remember what it was . He 'd seen himself trailing clouds of glory , a kind of social and professional comet blazing across the American sky while the populace stared awe-struck up at him . At twenty he had seen life always as a movement , an ever going forward , an attainment of one shining goal that immediately became a stepping-stone to one more shining . And now ? The buzzer sounded . Startled , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sound into a fact . Then , as understanding came back to him , he picked up the receiver of the house telephone and said , " Yes ? " " It 's Charlie Lovett , " a voice explained , " and Craig . All right if we come up ? " " You bet . Glad to see you . " A few minutes later there was a knock at the door . He  | opened it and said , " Come on in . I 'll have the drinks ready in a minute . " Craig Sherman laughed . " You 're clairvoyant , Tommy . How 'd you know we were dry ? " Tommy took their topcoats and threw them over a chair . " How do I know you 're breathing ? " he retorted . " Pay day for you is three days off ; you ring my bell . Q.E.D. A child of six would know . " " Well , " said Charlie , " we always knew your power of logic made you what you are today . " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the essentials for highballs . " We were over at the club bulling with a gang . Of course , we got on the depression , and , of course , it turned into the usual knock-down fight . Rememher how Nat Warren was all for Roosevelt two years ago ? Well , he 's turned Communist and he wo n't give Roosevelt credit for anything . I said he 'd have to admit it was damned good not to see breadlines any more , and , by jingo , I 'd touched a match to a powder keg . He let go on economic planning and governmental control and the abolition of poverty and the distribution of wealth until I was plumb cock-eyed . I think the guy 's got something on the ball all right , but he 's so damned dogmatic you want to contradict everything he says . Here , let me carry the siphon . " They returned to the living-room , prepared their drinks , and relaxed comfortably into the big chairs . " I know how you feel about Nat Warren , " Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up , especially when we all know his old man 's a banker . You ca n't help feeling he 's dishing up caviar for Nat with his right hand while he holds out an idealistic tract in his left to the starving proletariat . I suppose you made a speech , Charlie . " Cliarlie grinned . " Not this time . Doc Chambers did the honors . He blew the bugle and waved the flag . He was all but singing the Star-Spangled Banner , ' and Nat was all ready with the Internationale . ' It was swell for an hour or  | two , but they got to yelling at each other ; so Craig and I set out for a walk  --  and our noses knew . They brought us right to this damned good rye . " Craig Sherman sat up suddenly . He was a slender , nervous young man with curly black hair and snapping black eyes . Smaller than he liked to be , he was inclined to strut a little , moving his shoulders aggressively from side to side when he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he sounded defiant . At the moment , however , he was all male curiosity . " Say , " lie began , " I 've been wanting to ask you something . This morning I saw a girl go into your office  --  absolutely the ? well , I do n't seem to be able to produce the poetry ; but , honestly , Tom , I 've never seen anything like her . Laugh if you want to , but she reminded me of sunshine and daffodils . And class , too  --  worlds of it . Is she a client ? " " No , " said Tommy . " She 's just some one I know . " " Well , who is she ? Do n't be so damned secretive . " " She 's Morton Ballard 's wife . " " She is ? I did n't know they were friends of yours . " " They 're not . " " Mystery , " said Craig , turning to Charlie Lovett . " Beautiful blonde visits office of Thomas Beamish Gray for reasons undisclosed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , say I. " Tommy had no great objection to telling Craig who his visitor was , but he knew that a full disclosure would be embarrassing , and so he temporized . " I happened to bump into Mrs. Ballard the other night in the Waldorf and she thought she 'd said the wrong thing at the wrong time ; so she dropped in to explain . That 's all there is to it , " he said casually . " Mysteriouser and mysteriouser , " insisted Craig . " Casual acquaintances do n't drop into an attorney 's office to apologize for chance remarks . They send a note on crested notepaper . Come on , Tommy . Give us the low-down . " " Very well , " said Tommy , his voice even and quiet .  | " Mrs. Ballard is not exactly a casual acquaintance  --  and I did n't say she was . Hardly that . Five years ago she was my wife . " " Oh ! " Craig lowered his glass . His eyes and mouth opened , and a hot flush colored @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old man ? 1 swear , " he stuttered . Tommy smiled . " It 's all right , Craig . Do n't apologize . It was all natural enough , and I do n't mind . You 're wondering , I suppose , how I ever let anything so lovely get away from me . I was wondering the same thing when you buzzed . Well , it was n't my fault or hers either ; it was just one of those things . To tell you the truth , I 've been thinking all evening about her ? 1 do n't mean romantically . I Have n't been mooning or suffering regrets or anything like that . It 's just that she 's had a hard row to hoe , but in spite of everything she 's managed to find meaning in life , real significance , and I was thinking about the way she had done it . " Craig 's face had resumed its normal color and lie was sipping his drink again . Feeling that his guest was probably at ease once more , Tommy slid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've been thinking a lot about recently , " he went on , " ? the significance of life , I mean . I do n't know whether that kind of thinking is juvenile or not , but I do n't think it hurts a man to check up on himself once in a while  --  ask himself , I mean , if he 's going where he meant to , and if he is , if it 's the right place . Though that really is n't what I was getting at . Actually , I was wondering about the meaning of life itself . People obviously fund different reasons for living . It 's easy enough to see what the significance is for some people , what gives life real meaning for them . I think I know what it is for you , Craig . " " What ? " Craig demanded . " I know , but what do you think ? " " I think you want to be a great trial lawyer , a composite Webster , Choate , and Untermyer . I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think that you 're going to get out  | of it just as soon as you find an opening that will lead into a courtroom . " " Check , " admitted Craig . " Handling the details of estates is n't my idea of the law . No , by God , I want some fight in my work  --  and when I get the fight , I 'll feel plenty of significance , all right . What 's significant for you , Charlie ? You like mortgages . " Charlie rumpled his red hair , scratched his nose , and considered . " I do n't know what you mean by significance , " he said at last . " Well , put it this way , " Tommy said . " What gives your life continuity ? All our lives are broken into bits of experiences . Well , Craig 's are all pulled together by ambition , if you know what I mean . Lots of people 's are . Some people find the continuity through a never-ending desire for wealth or power . You are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ think you are . You take life pretty easily , but anybody can see it has meaning for you . We 're wondering what it is . What gives it its meaning ? " " Oh , that ! That 's simple , " said Charlie placidly , no longer needing to consider . " My religion does that . " Craig sat erect with a sudden jerk of his body . " Honest , Charlie , " he said aggressively , " you gripe me every time you say anything like that . You 're intelligent . You 've got brains . You know something . You did n't make Phi Bete and the Law Review on nothing . " He got up and strode to the table . " I 've got to have another drink . It makes my gizzard dry to hear a man like you talk medieval mush . " " I do n't know why you always get so worked up about it , " Charlie remarked reasonably . " You do n't have to eat the mush . " Craig squirted soda water angrily @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gag just the same . I do n't have to eat kidneys , either , to get sick . The smell 's enough . I would n't give a damn if I did n't respect your intelligence , but I do . Start you on any line of argument and you 'll follow it no matter  | where it goes . You 'll accept your conclusions no matter what they do to you . Except when they happen to touch your religion . Then you snap them off cold and stop thinking . I do n't see how in hell you do it or why in hell you do it . " He drank deeply and glowered at Charlie over the rim of his glass . " My God , Lovett , " he added with angry bluntness , you wo n't even argue with me about it . " Charlie waited for him to sit down again and then asked with the utmost good humor , " Why should I argue with you or anybody else ? I 'd be arguing with my happiness . I 'm happy in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ myself out of it ? " " No ! " Craig exploded the denial , and Tommy held up his hand . " Shut up , Craig , " he commanded , " and give Charlie a chance . You 're going off half-cocked . I want to know why Charlie 's religion makes him happy . " " I did n't say it made me happy , " Charlie contradicted . " I said it gave meaning to my life  --  and if I left it , I would n't have happiness . I suppose it 's like this , Tommy : the Church gives me all the answers . They were given to me when I was a child , and they 're a part of me . I 'm not full of doubts and fears like unbelievers ; I know . Or , as we say , I have faith . I was taught to believe , and I do believe . That faith is always operating in me and guiding me . It gives me standards and direction . When ? " " Standards ! " cried @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Hooey ! You Catholics make me sick . You make me sick . You think fornication 's a sin , and I do n't think it 's a sin  --  but you 've committed adultery from the Battery to the Bronx . You go around to some priest in a cage and say , Pretty please , Father , I 'm sorry ; I wo n't do it again , ' and he gives you now as pure as the driven snow ; ' so you start whoring from scratch again . Standards , blah ! "  | Charlie laughed . " Ai n't he eloquent ? " he asked Tommy . " No , Craig , you 're such a sanctified Joseph you ca n't understand . You 're so pure that you ca n't get past fornication to religion . You miss all the essentials . You always do ; that 's why I shut you up . You 're always wanting to talk about such non-essentials as holy relics , for instance . You 're always wanting to know whether I believe Mark Twain really saw two @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ whether I think the barrels of nails from the true cross in Italy really were in the cross , and whether those footprints in the chapel of Quo Vadis were made in marble , or whatever it is , by Jesus Himself . Believe me , I 'm sorry you ever saw Italy . " Well , my pugnacious little atheistical friend , what do things like that matter ? Do you honestly think my God hangs on the identity of a nail ? Do you really believe that my faith would be touched , shaken the least bit , if every holy relic were proved a fake ? You 're an atheist because you ca n't get past mundane things like nails and blocks of marble . " He paused and his blue eyes grew dreamy . " No , no , " he continued softly , " such things do n't matter . Even priests do n't matter . They 're just the servants of God , and only God matters . And arguments about God do n't matter either . If you have faith , if you believe @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , you 've got the truth that sets you free . " " But how do you know ? " Craig asked insistently , but more gently than Tommy would have believed possible . The dreaminess in Charlie 's eyes deepened and a little smile touched his lips . " I know , " he said softly . " Oh , I know . " Craig threw up his hands . " Yes , like hell you know ! You know the way the ancients knew the world was flat . You ? " But Tommy intervened . " Stop it , Craig , " he said sharply . " I ca n't follow Charlie . I admit that , but you 're acting like a jealous kid . Do you know that ? You have n't Charlie 's faith , and so you want to spoil it . "  | " I do n't ! " Craig denied hotly . " It 's just that I 'm fond of the bastard and I want to respect him . I 'm rooming with him . I roomed with him in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to understand his damned religion ever since I 've met him  --  and that 's as far as I ever get . " He whirled on Charlie . " Yeah , and you 're always looking down your nose at me , " he cried , his voice harsh with emotion . " You 've got the crust to pity me . " " Yes , " said Charlie , " in a way I suppose I do pity you . You 're always so worked up . You 're always banging your little head against the hard wall of your own ignorance and agnosticism . You 've made a religion of ambition . You 're trying to inflate yourself into your god because you ca n't find any other . You suffer with doubts because you have n't any faith . You try to answer eternal mysteries with scientific negations , and so you ca n't explain anything so you 're satisfied . Of course I pity you . We 've been friends a long time , and nobody likes to see his friends suffer . Listen , Craig : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Wait , " he urged as Craig prepared to speak ; " do n't say anything yet . You know well enough it 's one-tenth standards and nine-tenths envy . Well , all right ; fornication 's a dirty word , but I 'll admit it if you want me to . And you say the priest makes me pure so I can fornicate again . It is n't as simple as that , old man , and you know it is n't . And just because I do n't talk about it is n't any sign I have n't a consciousness of sin . But I do n't suffer the way you do because I know where I can find peace . " " But how can you find peace that way ? " wailed Craig . " I do n't see how any intelligent man can find peace that way . " " By faith . " Craig snapped his fingers and opened his hand in a gesture of futility and defeat . " The same old circle ! Can you see any sense in it , Tom ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it makes Charlie happy and so it 's got all the sense in the world for him . You  | and I are different ; that 's all . I think I 'm temperamentally incapable of that kind of faith , but , " he added in a flash of sudden understanding , " I think you might make an awfully good Catholic , Craig . " Craig swore long and blasphemously while Charlie laughed . " I 've told him that lots of times , " he explained to Tommy , " and it always sets him off like this . Let 's leave the poor guy alone . Are you going to Cambridge for the Dartmouth game ? " From then on the talk switched from one inconsequential subject to another . Tommy enjoyed the visit , but he was n't sorry when Craig and Charlie left . He was interested in what Charlie had said . It blended so completely with his thoughts about Freda . In some incomprehensible way those two , so completely different , were attaining somewhat the same ends by means as utterly dissimilar @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ too , was going to find that same end probably through another means  --  if he did n't suddenly surrender to the mysticism that he was fighting so bitterly . " Well , " he thought wearily , " it 's bedtime  --  and none of it applies to me . I suppose it did six or seven years ago , but not now . It 's awfully interesting , but I seem to be entirely outside all of it . " Was he weaker , he wondered , than Craig and Charlie , shallower , or was he just a little more mature ? After all , he was several years older than they were , and he had done a lot more living . Yet he envied them . He lifted his arms and yawned mightily . " I 've lost Freda and I 've never had God . " What now ? Then he saw his reflection in the mirror staring blindly at him , and he grinned at it . " Boy , " he said , addressing his mirrored self , " you 're turning adolescent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one , and Tommy 's mind was fully occupied with legal matters until four o'clock . Finally the job on hand was done . He leaned back in his desk chair and stretched . " Phew , what a day ! " Well , a few fast games of squash would take the kinks out of him and set him up again . The sooner Fred Homans phoned , the better . He was eager to get on the court . The door opened softly and Mae Vadney 's head appeared . " Busy ? " she asked . " Just done . Come on in . What 's on your mind ? " " Oh , I just need a signature and you 're the only partner left in the place . " She came to his desk and laid a paper on it . " Just scribble Thomas B. Gray right here and I 'll leave you in peace . " Tommy wrote his name and then looked up at her smilingly . " You see my faith in you , Miss ? ' scuse it , please  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my fortune and my life . " " It 's only ? " she began , but Tommy interrupted with a laugh . " What do I care ? I 'm tired , and I know it 's all right if you say so . It must feel pretty good , Mae , to know that everybody in this office has perfect faith in you . " " Well , it does , " she confessed . " I get pretty cross sometimes , and sometimes I hate all of you  --  or I like to think I do . Then I take it out on poor Mr. Jonathon . I tell him all men are too careless to live , but he just laughs at me . You are careless , though , every one of you . " " I suppose we are , but we would n't be if we did n't have  | some one like you to depend on . You 're terribly necessary . You know that , of course . " " Of course I know it ! How do you suppose ? ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " What 's on your mind ? I 'm not going to let any conscienceless lawyer lead me into a trap ; I 've been around lawyers too long . " " There 's no trap , Mae , " he assured her . " It 's just that you work terribly hard and we get all the credit  --  most of the money , too . I was just wondering if you thought it was worth while . " She looked toward the chair beside his desk and then shook her head . " No , I have n't time to sit clown . Do n't you suppose I 've wondered about that a thousand times ? I never saw the inside of a law school , but I know more about a lot of things than any man in this office  --  and I 've got a better mind for details than the whole kit and caboodle of you put together . Of course , I know that . But  --  oh , well , I 'm too busy most of the time to do much thinking , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " she added , putting up her hands to the big knot of hair at the nape of her neck , " it 's nice to be necessary . " She pulled out a hairpin , reinserted it , pulled out another and poked around with it until she found the spot where it would do the most good . " I 'm happier than most old maids . " Tommy wanted to ask her if she found the office a satisfactory substitute for husband and children , but he lacked the courage . Most of the time Mae did seem happy . She scolded everybody , but it was affectionate scolding . What was her life away from the office ? He supposed Mr. Jonathon knew ; probably Mr. Frederick did , too , but in the years he had known her it had never occurred to him before that she did n't cease to exist when she closed the office door behind her . Did she go to a little apartment somewhere and feel lonely the way he did ? Or did she go to the movies and suffer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in her life besides endless work . " What are you thinking ? " Mae demanded .  | " I was thinking about you , " he said carefully . " I was thinking that I 've been letting an opportunity slip by me . You 're pretty wonderful , you know , and it 's just dawned on me ? well , that I need a woman like you in my life . Will you have dinner with me some night ? " He grinned up at her . " I mean will you let me dress up in my soup and fish and trail humbly after you into the Sert Room ? " Mae leaned forward and patted his cheek . " You 're a darling . I 'm not lonesome . I have a niece who lives with me . " " Who 's talking about being lonesome ? I 'm the one who 's lonesome . How about it ? " " You lonesome ! " scoffed Mae . " You and your poker games and deb parties and a harem of girl friends . Lonesome , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You wo n't want to waste an evening on me . You get enough of me in the office . " " But I do n't , " Tommy insisted . " You stick your long nose in the door a couple of times a day and snarl at me , but we never get a chance to talk . Come on , Mae , be a sport and break bread with me . Honestly , I 'll be grateful . " " Well , if I 'm not getting a thrill ! " cried Mae . " I half believe you mean it ! Well , sir , I 'll just take you up on that , and I warn you right now that I dote on guinea hen . When 'll it be ? " They agreed on a date just as the telephone rang . It was Fred Homans calling . " I 'm ready when you arc , " he said . " O.K. , " said Tommy . " I 'll meet you at the club just as soon as I can get there . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ engagements . He was overdoing it , he decided . He had n't read a book since he had returned from his vacation , and there were at least a dozen new books that he wanted to read . And he was accepting invitations that he did n't really want to accept . Anything to avoid an evening alone .  | That was no go . He was running away from himself , running away from the world ; and he knew that there was something unthinking , almost frantic , about his meaningless efforts to escape something undefined and unnamed . " If I keep this up , " he thought irritably , " I 'll be something a psychiatrist will find interesting . " He read the Times conscientiously every morning , the Sun every evening , but he knew that he was reading them with the top of his mind . The world was simmering ; dangerous little geysers were bursting forth , here , there , everywhere . Hitler pointed a menacing finger , and rumbles of defiance and fear followed . England was speaking sharply to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Spain was in a ferment . Something was going to happen there . Stalin was building airplanes by the thousands and training flyers apparently by the tens of thousands . England was frankly getting ready for rearmament , and France seemed to be already armed . Japan and China . . . Japan and Russia . . . Germany and Russia . . . Germany and Austria . . . Italy and Ethiopia . . . And money in every country about as stable as a ball of mercury on an oscillating board . What did he think about it all ? He hardly knew . Good luck and his father 's foresight were bringing him safe through the depression , but no one was safe in a world so terrified , so downright hysterical . And if the worst was over , as it apparently was , there were still those millions lacking work  --  and those millions were listening to demagogues . Fireeaters mounted soap boxes and screamed defiance of the government ; Father Coughlin bellowed dubious economics into a microphone ; book reviewers judged even romantic novels @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Washington , bided their little while , were busted and disappeared ; Roosevelt smiled , something went wrong and somebody else took the rap , and Roosevelt leaned toward the radio , said , " My friends , " and charmed unknown millions into believing in him by the sheer magic of his voice .  | The bankers , now that their banks were safe once more in spite of them , were growing cocky again and demanding power as if they had it by divine right ; the great industrialists no longer rushed to Washington and pleaded for remedies and aid . Once more the wheels were turning , and they wanted the power curbed that had started the wheels . Labor was beginning to stir . There was a strike here , a strike there . Would there be a surplus of goods ? If there was , what would the government do about it ? What should it do about surpluses ? Should it do anything ? Were depressions the result of economic cycles , or were they the result of man 's stupidity and greed ? Was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did he think ? The truth was , he knew , that he had been refusing to think . He had not thought , really thought , since he had come to New York ; instead , he had evaded thought as carefully and completely as he could . He had a deck of ideas from which he dealt whenever necessity required , but he had not shredded those ideas into their various strands , examined them , evaluated them . He owned , he thought , a logical mind , and he despised people who did not estimate their premises before they spoke ; but his power of analysis was growing rusty from disuse . He found careful , disinterested thought a genuine effort . Even the depression had touched his purse far more than it had his mind . During the worst days Mrs. Frederick Winchester had run a soup kitchen to which he had contributed heavily . He had given more to the Community Chest than his income warranted , and nine times out of ten he had succumbed to the pleas of beggars . And relatives whom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could not refuse . At the end of each year he found that he had spent every cent of his income and salary , most of it on others . But the giving of money , he knew well enough , was something largely apart from himself . After all , he had been denied nothing that he really wanted , and so he did not have  | even the satisfaction of feeling generous . Whenever possible he had escaped the problems and ugliness and horror of the depression in work and pleasure  --  and he knew that Polly had been especially precious to him because she had made his escape almost complete . It was a tremendously interesting , fascinating , terrible world he was living in ; but he was observing it rather than experiencing it . Most people , he suspected , either were n't aware of it or escaped from it whenever possible . To nine out of ten the great problems were significant only so long as their stomachs were empty . After a month of good feeding , most of them did more thinking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about anything else . He did n't even have a car to think about . He could buy one if he wanted it , but he did n't want one in New York City . Well , that indifference and selfishness were to be expected of uneducated , stupid people . After all , possessions were about all most them got out of life , and the possessions were visible evidence of progress . To people like that a new car meant a lot ; it was a symbol . But he did n't believe he was that kind of person . He thought he was intelligent , and he certainly had been given the opportunities of an education . And the other men in the office had the interest he lacked . Mr. Jonathon and Mr. Frederick were conservative to their toes , but they had watched the rise and fall of the NRA with passionate absorption . To his surprise , they had found virtues in it , though from the first they had insisted that it was unconstitutional . Those men , both well into their sixties , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nation . They followed the discussions in Congress far more eagerly than most of the club lounge orators followed them . They were alive to the world ; and being alive to it , they were an integral part of it . So was Martin Tucker , though he looked so dry and academic . He was a bitter man , apparently cold and disillusioned ,  | but somewhere in him a spark of hope still glowed . The Russian experiment fascinated him . " It 's the most important human experiment , " he said , " since the American constitution was written . " Teddy Winchester , only a few months out of the Columbia Law School , was full to bursting with Utopian ideas ; Craig Sherman was sardonically contemptuous of every politician 's good faith , but alive to their every move ; and even good-natured Charlie Lovett would burst into a flame of excitement whenever Communism or Fascism was mentioned . Tommy alone remained cold . He was interested , but unmoved . His mind stirred , but not his emotions . The others felt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but he did not . Yet he once had . In college he had cared passionately about economic and governmental problems . He had been a red-hot liberal in those days , and he thought he was still a liberal  --  but all the fire of battle had died in him . The things he had once cared about ! How he had dreamed ! If only he could care about anything now the way he had once cared about being a mile runner . His father had been a great track man , and he had dreamed about being one , too . He had abstained from cigarettes , liquor , and women for the sake of that dream . Nights he had lain in bed and run imaginary races  --  even when he was twenty years old he had done that . " Down on your marks , get set ? " the crack of the pistol . They were off . That famous man from California had the pole . He held the meet record . Lord , what a pace he was setting ! But , take @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 're four laps and this is only the first ; take your time . Relax . That 's it . Remember what coach told you . Relax . There , a Princeton jersey was ahead now . Well , he would n't last . He never did . The first lap . . . Feeling fine . Legs felt good . Plenty of wind . The second lap . In fourth place now . The pace was fast , but not too fast . Stay where you are . Let the other fellows break the wind . The third  | lap . Beginning to feel it . Never mind ; remember the others are feeling it too . The man ahead falls back . In third place now . All right . Just hold it . The pistol . The last lap . Stretch out . Stretch out . The California man breaks ahead , five yards , ten yards . A Harvard man holds two yards ahead of him . Somebody passes . Hold it . Hold it . They reach the curve and the other fellow falls back . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm gaining . I 'm ? Everything now . Everything ! And then the blinding , gasping , agonizing effort , forcing dead legs on , on , passing something , knowing that something was ahead , fighting toward it , fighting , fighting , fighting ? falling into somebody 's arms . " You won ! You won , Tommy ! You beat him at the tape ! You won ! " Friends holding him up , pounding his back , hugging him . " You won ! " And then the voice of the announcer : " The mile race . Won by Thomas Gray of Dartmouth . " A pause while the Dartmouth cheering section roars applause . " In four minutes , seven and seven-tenths seconds , breaking the record . " Oh , how many , many times he had dreamed that dream ? and he had never broken 4:23 in his life . Yet the dream , all the effort , even the failure itself had been worth while . Why , that dream and the vague possibility of its fulfilment had made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ while , too . Strange , it was hard to remember what they were , but they were all twisted around dreams of greatness that went beyond winning races . Sometimes in spring up in Hanover he had sneaked off for long walks by himself . He had avoided the Outing Club trails lest he meet somebody . He wanted no company but his thoughts . Trudging over the hills , he analyzed himself and his fellows . Some of them he admired , and some of them he rather despised ; and in those days he had known so certainly just why this one was the right kind and that one the wrong . About many things he was confused , uncertain , but about his standards he was very sure .  | Now he was no longer sure . It was n't so much that he had broken faith with himself as that people did not fit so definitely into pigeon-holes as they had nine or ten years before . How neatly he would have classified Polly Beeman , and how wrong he would have been ! In those @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and he never could have understood that sometimes crooked politicians ran a government more efficiently than honest reformers did . Well , he still could n't understand that to his complete satisfaction . He knew it was a fact , but to accept the fact as a working principle meant that he must lower his opinion of mankind rather more than he wanted to . Skepticism was all right ; so , he supposed , was cynicism , but he was damned if he wanted to be a pessimist . His telephone rang . " Hello , " he said . " This is Fred  --  Fred Homans , Tommy . I 'm getting up a crowd to go to Cambridge for the Dartmouth game . Want to go along ? " " Thanks , Fred , but I ca n't make it . But I 'm on for the Yale game if the gang 's going . " " Sure we are . " " Well , count me in . Six clients and two broken legs could n't keep me away from a Yale game . You 're always @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " said Fred , who had gone to Princeton , " except that Dartmouth will win . " " We 'll break that hoodoo someday , and that thirty-three to thirty-three game was worth a couple of hoodoos . " " I 'll say it was . O.K. , then ; I 'll fix it up . Squash to-morrow ? " " You bet . Thanks for calling . " The conversation had broken his mood . He was sorry because he felt in a confused way that he had been working toward some kind of decision . He had to do something . It  | was stupid to let his life slip by without reason or meaning to it . He wanted to feel . He wanted to work for something or somebody ; he wanted to have ambition again . What , he wondered , was ambition , anyway ? How many people really had it once they had reached maturity ? Not many , he was sure . Oh , well , it did n't make much difference so long as they wanted something hard  --  and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He had to break through the emptiness and vague meaninglessness of his existence to significance . He 'd be damned if he would go on sitting around mooning like a rattlebrained kid . He was a partner in a distinguished law firm ; he was supposed to be grown up . It was really preposterous that a man with his gift for pleasure should have his feeling of emptiness . Nobody had better times than he had , and most people with his capacity for pleasure and his opportunities for it would feel that they had attained happiness . Broadway was jammed with people who did n't seem to ask for anything more than a succession of good times . But his pleasures were isolated . He did not look forward to them or back on them . He met them , enjoyed them  --  and then they ceased . One could n't forever run from poker game to squash court , from concert hall to dinner party , from theater to ballroom , from country club to the Metropolitan . And one could n't satisfy sexual hunger , either @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ care about or with a night now and then with some one like Harriet Carrington , about whom he cared even less . Somehow , he had to get a fresh start , a new approach . Thirsty , he went to the kitchen for a drink of water . Ah , a note from Maribelle . What was it now ? " Dere Mr. Gray , " Maribelle had written , " you forgot to leve my munney and I needs it awful bad because my husband up and died on me and the undertaker man wont do  | no waiting at all . I knows you forgot but I needs it , the funneral cost a awful lot Mr. Gray but it was turribel swell and Augustus made a wunnerful korpis . He wore yore blue suit with the dubble brest , I bet you never thot it was agoing into a grave afore you did but you wooda been proud of it on Augustus honest , hopeing you are the same , Maribelle . " Tommy chuckled and then grew sober . Poor Maribelle . She was probably @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " He counted out the money he owed her and placed it in the glass on the ice-box ; then , moved to generosity by pity , he added a five-dollar bill , picked up the pencil and wrote : " Dear Maribelle : I 'm sorry about the money , and I 'm very sorry to learn about your loss . You must be very lonesome . The extra five dollars is to help you pay the undertaker . Please accept it with my sympathy . " Maribelle 's note , he found , had cleared his mind , and before he went to bed he came to a decision : he would go to Hanover for a day or two . Next week-end ? No , not a weekend at all . Either there would be crowds in town for a football game or most of the boys would be away for one . He wanted to be there when the college atmosphere was normal ; he wanted to get back into it again . He wanted to step back nine years and take a look at himself @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the office for a couple of days . Yes , that was what he would do . He could n't get any perspective in New York , and he had n't been back to Dartmouth for eight years . The sudden , complete change of atmosphere ought to shake him out of himself , make it possible perhaps for him to break the circle of his thoughts and straighten it out into a line that pointed somewhere . The next evening he went to the ice-box to leave a note for Maribelle to tell her that he was going out of town . A note from her was waiting for him . " Dere Mr. Gray , I guess you no I wasent hinting for no munney and so ive taken the munney , you is the kinnest  | gennelmum I works for and I sure does thank you . No sir I ai nt lonesome none because my brudder Charlie that uster take care of yore furnus is living with me now and he sets jes as good as Augustus uster , I always seems to have a settin man @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Hanover was altogether different from what he had anticipated . Even his reaction to White River Junction was unexpected . When he left the train there , the gritty bleakness of the railroad yards struck him as if he had never experienced it before . He knew , of course , that the station had always been dirty and ugly , but he had no memory of such shanty-like ugliness and grime . Why , the station seemed even smaller as well as dirtier . Surely , it must be . Then he remembered that there had been a fire , which , unfortunately , had been extinguished before it had completed its divinely appointed task . The Junction actually depressed him , but almost immediately he remembered a story current at Dartmouth in his student days , and he smiled . The incident was supposed to have taken place before his time . Perhaps it was apocryphal , but it sounded real enough . It seemed that an English instructor decided to fill an hour by reading themes to his class that he had not previously read to himself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and to his own consternation , he heard himself reading a student 's placid assertion that he had seen a certain professor , whom he named , in White River Junction in a " house of ill fame . " An hour later Hanover rang with the story , and the professor was alternating angry denials with insistent demands that the lying freshman be immediately dismissed from college . The freshman was utterly bewildered . He said he did n't know what all the excitement was about  --  and he had n't lied .  | He had seen the professor . But what of it ? What was the matter with being in the station at the Junc ? Well , reflected Tommy , as he made his way across the tracks , the freshman had certainly used his words accurately enough even if he had been too innocent to understand what they connoted . At Dartmouth the Junc Station had furnished material for a thousand scathing quips , and the memory of the story made him eager to get to Hanover . It brought the college back to him with @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ community was , what a unit it was  --  as different from New York with its scattered , constantly changing , constantly disintegrating groups as it was possible for a place to be . He hurried to the bus . It would be good to get there . But at first it was n't good . He suffered an immediate letdown . Several students were passing the Inn as he entered it . He knew none of them . His time had passed . He was a stranger . Within an hour , however , he felt a lightening of his spirit . Boys were kicking a football on the campus ; the clock in Dartmouth Flail struck four ; somebody yelled to somebody else , " Come on and get a coke , " and the other fellow yelled back , " Ca n't . I 've got to go down to the gym " ; students passed , students and students and students , some of them sober with thought , some of them laughing , all of them casually dressed , all of them young . The rains @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their incredible autumn brilliance . The air sparkled , coldly crisp . Somebody cried gleefully , " Was that exam a pipe ? Boy ! " He was back . This was Dartmouth . Slowly he walked under the great elms . He hesitated before the administration building . The president was coming down the steps . Tommy half turned , then moved on . " He wo n't remember me , " he thought regretfully . " Oh , Gray ! "  | He turned . The president was smiling at him . " It is Tommy Gray , is n't it ? " Tommy glowed . This was wonderful . Imagine the Prex remembering him after all these years . " Yes , sir , " he said , grasping the proffered hand ; " I 'm Gray , but I did n't think you would know me . " " Of course I remember you , " the president said , his brown eyes smiling . " Do you want to know why ? " Tommy grinned and shook his head . " No , I do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ day I fell across the track ten yards from the finish and three men piled on me . That 's it , is n't it ? " " Well , yes  --  that and other things .

The new library is grand , of course , but I ca n't imagine Dartmouth without the little white church . I felt sick when it burned . " " We all did . " The president held out his hand . " I 'm sorry I have an engagement , and I mean that honestly . I should like to have a real talk with you , but I 'm a little late now . Tonight I have to go to Boston , but the next time you come please look me up . I 'll see to it that we have time for a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and walked on feeling warm with gratitude and pleasure . lie felt as if he had got his identity back . It was something to be remembered by the president of the college after all these years . The little mark he had made on the Dartmouth slate had n't yet been quite erased . He turned , passed Sanborn House . Two men were standing by the steps . He remembered both of them well , though the smaller one had n't worn that little imperial beard in his day . The other man was taller , blue-eyed . He certainly had n't changed much . His hair was white now , but it had been so  | fair that the whiteness did n't make him look older . Tommy had had a course with him . What was it ? Chaucer ? Yes  --  of course , that was it . " Tommy Gray , " the blue-eyed professor said , holding out his hand . " What are you doing up here ? Somebody told me you were getting rich out of the law in New York . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mostly I 'm being terribly surprised . I did n't expect any one to know me . " " Why not ? " asked the smaller man . " You have n't changed . Do you think I could read forty or fifty thousand words of yours and forget you ? " " I thought you could , but I 'm awfully glad you have n't . " The professors were in no hurry . Nobody seemed to be in a hurry , and later Tommy knew that at least half of his initial depression had been due to the sudden slowing of the tempo of life , to the quiet , the serenity . The whole atmosphere had seemed unnatural . He had remembered college as an exciting experience ; now he knew that the peaks of excitement had been well spaced and that the valleys between had been broad , filled with classes , study , sport , movies , and endless discussions . He strolled across the campus with the professors , caught a football that happened to come his way , threw it hack to a smiling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Ile left the professors at the bookstore , promised to call on them both in Sanborn House next day , and returned to the Inn . He no longer wanted to walk . The nervous impulse that had made movement a necessity an hour before was gone . Now filled with contentment , he wanted to relax and savor it to the full . He found an empty chair on the Inn porch , Iifted his heels to the porch railing , lighted a cigarette , and leaned back . Lord , it was good to be here ! He was n't thinking . He did n't even want to think . In a little while the evening cold would drive him indoors , but  | the twilight haze made his college beautiful and he did n't want to miss a moment of it . People passed : housewives going to or from the shops , students hurrying to a preposterously early dinner , professors on their way home or to a store , townspeople , and even tourists seeking the last glorious moments of a New England autumn . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Pardon me . Are n't you Tommy Gray ? " A slender , rather unkempt-looking man was facing him . Tommy blinked . A vague thought had been drifting through his mind , and for a moment it clung . Then recognition came . " Mr. Kingston ! " he cried . In jumping to his feet and leaning forward , he bumped his knees against the porch railing , but he paid no heed ; he was glad to see this man . " It 's good to see you . " Kingston had been his instructor in freshman English , and a friendship had been begun that had lasted during Tommy 's four years at Dartmouth . Kingston had been very kind to him , and he repeated how happy he was to see him . " I like to hear that , " Kingston said frankly . " We must have a talk . How long are you going to be here ? Can you come to dinner tomorrow night ? I know my wife has an engagement tonight or I 'd ask you to come along @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sometime tomorrow , " Tommy explained . " But why ca n't you have dinner here at the Inn with me tonight ? I was planning to go to the Nugget just to see if the fellows still threw peanuts , but I 'd a thousand times rather talk to you . " " Well , I 'll put your mind at rest ; they still throw them . I caught one in the ear night before last . Why , yes , I can have dinner with you . I 'd like to . I 'll have to go home first , but I 'll be back by the time the doors are opened . " He held out his hand . " It 's mighty good to see you . "  | Darkness was coming and with it the cold . Tommy secured his key at the desk and went upstairs to his room . He had better than an hour to wait for Kingston , and , finding himself quite inexplicably weary , he took off his shoes and stretched out on the bed . The quiet ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of an automobile horn , a boy 's voice now and then  --  and then the quiet again . In his college days the quiet had seemed natural to him , though he had n't recognized it as quiet . He had never really known anything else except at rare intervals . Andover had been quiet too , and the little western Massachusetts town where he had lived his boyhood days had been even quieter . The stillness brought peace and memories . He thought of his mother out in California . Then quickly he put her out of his mind and concentrated on his father . He wished he could remember his father better . There were memories that were so vivid , so heartbreakingly real that they almost brought tears , but those were memories only of especially happy moments in a child 's life . He could see his father only through a boy 's eyes , and he wanted to see him through his own , a man 's . Tommy had had a happy boyhood until he was twelve . His father , also Thomas Beamish @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Harvard and the Harvard Law School and then returned to practice his profession in his home town . A long line of Grays had slowly and carefully accumulated money and goods , each adding his share , each passing a larger total on to his successor . Tommy 's father never lived in but one house , the house he was born in , a big , white colonial building with a fanlight over the door . The lawns stretched fifty yards down a gentle slope to the elm-shaded street . Tommy was born in that house too , but now a cousin lived there . Thomas Gray , Senior , was dead , and without him the house held memories that his son wanted to forget .  | Tommy 's father had died in France of influenza in 1918 . Tommy would never forget the day the telegram came . His mother had promptly had hysterics , and it was n't until his twenty-first birthday that Tommy understood why her screams had angered him . He had no desire to protect her , to weep with her , only a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He fled to the snowy hills and fought his way through drifts as if at the end of a hidden trail he would find understanding ; but it was all futile striving . He could not realize that he would see his father no more , that they never would go fishing together again , play catch again in the twilight , skate in January , fly kites in March . His father was dead in France and his mother would hang a flag with a star on it out of the window . She would wear black and look proud and sad . She would ; he knew she would . For the first time he realized clearly that he hated his mother , and he did n't know why . A week later Mr. Burton called him into the bank and handed him a letter . " Your father was going to war , Tommy , " he said gently , " and , of course , he knew he might not come back ; so he left everything in order . In his will he instructed me to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one you 're to have when you 're twenty-one . I do n't want you to read this one until you 're alone . " He talked a long time , but Tommy only half understood much of what he said . He did understand that he was to go to Phillips Andover Academy in another year , then choose his own college and his own profession . He was told something about a trust fund that was to be his when he was twenty-three , and something about interest that was to be used in the meantime for education and travel . Mr. Burton and the bank were executors . He did n't know what executors were , but somehow he gained the idea that Mr. Burton had just as much to say about him as his mother had . He was glad of that . He liked Mr. Burton . It was a long letter that his father had written him , so understanding and tender that he wept over it time and  | time again . Parts of it became part of his consciousness . " You and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my boy . I think I know what the difficulty is , but I ca n't explain to you now ; you 're too young . It 's a lot to ask patience of a boy your age . I know that , but I do ask it . And it 's almost cruel to say this , but I must say it . I have no choice . I feel quite sure that your mother will marry again . I hope she will . Remember that , Tommy ; I hope she will . So try not to be resentful . Be generous . " And later in the letter : " It is cruel for you to lose a father just when puberty is so near . That 's when a boy needs a father most , and I hope you find somebody to take my place . You 've never been one to confide in people , though , and I doubt if you will ; so I must try to guess what advice you will need in the next few years . The worst of it is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ give you . I wish I were wiser , but all I have to go on is my own mistakes . " I 'm glad now that I 've answered all your questions and that we had those good talks . About facts you know everything there is any need to know , but it 's ideals I ought to talk about and I do n't know what to say . You 're an intense boy , and if you 're like me , you 'll be a passionate one . In a way I 'm glad of that . I pity people who lack passion . And never be ashamed of your own . I can say that much to you positively . Never be ashamed of your passion . It 's wholesome and normal . I know I ought to tell you to be chaste always , but I know what happens sometimes . I know what happened to me . How I wish you were a couple of years older . You would understand so much better what I 'm trying to say . I can only hope @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 're the normal boy I 'm sure you are , temptation may be very strong and very sudden . That 's what happened to me before I was sixteen . The girl was older and lots wiser than I was . Well , I did n't care after that  --  and that 's where I made my mistake . I suffered for it , too . I think there 's safety in chastity , Tommy , but remember that you have to have  | standards whether you are chaste or not . The standards are a lot more important than the chastity . That , at least , is what I think . Do n't do anything you think is cheap . I ca n't tell you how much I hate to admit to you that I have done things I thought were cheap , but I have and I do n't want you to suffer my shame and my regrets . It 's terribly important that you should respect yourself . " Tommy tried hard to be kind to his mother , but her parade of her @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ England Yankee by training and inheritance , and his sorrow was secret , something that he could share with no one . His mother luxuriated in emotion , rolled in it like the family pussy in a bed of catnip , gloried in the dramatic opportunities her widowhood brought with it . And deep , deep down in him Tommy knew that her sorrow was n't real , that her tears were just a performance . He was glad when the day came to go to Andover . He kissed her good-bye dutifully , let her weep over him , and then went away without once looking back . A year later she married Melville Clarke , a handsome actor . He was a year or two younger than she was and had been twice divorced . Tommy never learned where or how they met . He did n't care about anything so long as he did n't have to be with them , and it was many years before he even suspected that he might have been unjust to Clarke . He took an immediate and abiding dislike to the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ possible . The evasion was easy . Clarke , of course , insisted on living in New York , and his wife was delighted to leave behind the town she had always loathed . Tommy spent as many Christmas vacations with schoolmates as invitations provided ; and so long as he was in preparatory school , he spent his summer vacations in camps . The year that he entered Dartmouth , Clarke got his chance in Hollywood . Tommy had seen his mother only once since . Occasionally he saw Clarke on the screen , nowadays only in bit parts . Usually some one was with Tommy ,  | but he never revealed to his companion that they were looking at a likeness of his stepfather . When he was eighteen , Mr. Burton explained his father 's will to him . Later , after he had studied law , he realized how carefully security for him had been planned . Probably by cajolery , perhaps even by duplicity , Thomas Gray had succeeded in getting his wife 's signature on papers that took all control of the estate out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , another for Tommy . Tommy 's share of the estate became his when he reached his twenty-third birthday , but her share was in trust for her lifetime , and it was to revert to Tommy at her death . Each of them had a few thousand a year . Some of the money had been invested in real estate , but Thomas Gray had been careful to invest nearly all the remainder in Liberty Bonds before he sailed for France . Tommy spent four of his five college vacations traveling in Europe and South America . Once he went to California . That was after Burton had sent him the letter his father had written as his twenty-first birthday present . " Dear Tommy , " it read : " It does n't seem possible that you will be a man grown when you read these words and that I shall have been long years in my grave . Well , be sure of this , my son : if there is any life after death , my spirit will be with you . I 've never dared tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't dare tell you now . But when you were born , I thought life might be worth living  --  and it was . " Your mother did n't want you . She did n't want any children . She was terrified , and I 'm cruel enough to believe that it was the possible loss of her figure that terrified her most . Therefore you might as well know that you were entirely an accident , and if various medicines had been as effective as she hoped they would be , you would n't have been at all . Probably I sound bitter , but I 've never quite got over the arguments your mother and I had in those days . She bore you , it is true , but I suffered something worse than labor pains for nine long months and for months thereafter .  | " I think I 've started quite the wrong way , because I 'm writing this letter hoping that it will help you to understand your mother . Perhaps when you have read it , you 'll understand me and yourself a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that she has married again and that you do n't like her new husband . You would n't , partly because he has taken my place , but mainly , I think , because you 're like me : you are n't likely to take to the kind of man your mother admires . " And that 's the first thing for you to understand , Tommy . I 've been a terrible disappointment to your mother . You see , she was a beauty . ( To me she still is a beauty . ) And so she had lots of chances , but they were the wrong kind . Her family , as you know , is rather poor , and so she did n't meet the kind of men generally that she wanted to marry . That , remember , is really something to her credit . Then quite by accident I met her at a college dance . She had been brought by a fellow who lived near her in Roxbury . I fell in love with her at first sight . " I honestly believe she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suppose I seemed pretty glamorous . When she saw our house , it was wonderful to her  --  and so was my car and your grandfather 's horses . " I do n't think she was really happy for six months . She hated the conventions of a small town , and she could n't understand me . She was ashamed of her own family , though I never knew why , and thought we were ashamed of her . In her own way she suffered , I feel sure . And I do n't suppose I 've always been kind . I know I practically forced motherhood on her when she hated the thought of it . I would n't let her wear the kind of clothes she wanted to wear , and I walked out over and over again and killed the emotional scenes that were the breath of life to her . I think she might have loved me if I could have shouted at her now and then . " Well , Tommy , she 's put up with fifteen years of unhappiness with me . Remember @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't understand this ; so just accept it . I 've never stopped  | loving her . For no reason I can understand she is the one woman in the world for me . And if you grow bitter sometimes , remember that she was loyal to me long after she had quit loving me , that she suffered me without complaint in your presence , and that she did her conscientious best for you . She would have done better if you had given her a real chance , but from babyhood it was to me that you turned always . You and I understood each other . You and she never did . That must have been bitter for her . " So now , Tommy , if she has found happiness with another man , do n't be censorious ; be glad . You 'll never understand her . I know that . Be kind to her . You 're twenty-one now ( how incredible that seems ! ) and you promise to be a goodlooking man . ( I 'm confusing my tenses . I ca n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when you 'll be reading . I should have said , of course . You promised to be a good-looking man . ' ) Good looks mean a lot to her . She 'll love going to expensive places to dine with you and excursions of that sort . She suffered at the hands of her husband ; I hope she can find some happiness in her son . " So that summer Tommy went to California , but he and his mother were strangers who could never become friends . Her talk was all of clothes , parties , and motion-picture stars . She was a walking , talking directory of Hollywood ; and she spoke of every picture in which Melville Clarke had two scenes as if he were the only person who drew audiences to see it . Obviously she was happy with Clarke , though how any woman could endure the man 's vanity , his posturings , and continuous self-glorification , Tommy could not understand . He and Clarke were born to be courteous strangers at the very best ; and to him , his mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would , and he honestly did try , he could feel no kinship with her . Thereafter he dutifully wrote to her at long intervals , sent her birthday and Christmas presents , and she responded in kind . But she did not need him and made no pretense of  | needing him . His father 's letter had reached him years too late . No effort could attain the end the letter asked for . As he waited for Kingston , Tommy thought back through the years . Yes , he had needed his father , needed him badly always . Mr. Burton had been kind ; so had the masters at Andover . And perhaps the track coach had done as much as anybody with his constant , " Take it easy , Tommy ; take it easy . Remember that you 're only a kid . Do n't try so hard . You 'll burn yourself out . It 's a long pull to be a great miler . You ca n't be a record-breaker tomorrow or the day after tomorrow . Milers develop late , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ hard . You 're always trying too hard . You take everything too seriously . Relax , kid ; run easily and you 'll get there faster . " Well , decided Tommy , he had n't done so badly for a fellow who 'd practically been an orphan . He 'd kept a lot straighter than most . Even when he was thirteen he 'd known what his father had meant by needing his own respect . He had needed it then ; he had always needed it . Ile supposed some people called it pride . He did n't know ; but whatever it was , it had kept him from excesses . There had been some pretty bad times now and then , moments when he had hated himself , but even in such a moment he had known that the lapse was only temporary , that he would fight his way back to his own standard . An Andover master had told him once that he was a walking relic of all his Puritan ancestors . The master had been teasing , but there had been truth @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and spread his arms wide . Puritan ancestors , he decided comfortably , were a pretty darn good thing for a fatherless boy to have .  | DINNER with Kingston was pleasant . He had much to tell Tommy about the changes in the college , about what had been done and about what the administration hoped to do . People came into the dining-room whom Tommy recognized . He asked Kingston about them ; he asked him about everybody who came to mind . He felt an eagerness to learn everything he could about Dartmouth College . During a momentary break in the conversation he remembered that he came to Hanover to step back in time , not to catch up with it ; but his curiosity was in full flood and swept unresisted over his original intention . After dinner he and Kingston passed into the neighboring lounge . " Shall we sit here ? " Tommy asked . " Or would you like to go up to my room ? " " I like it here , " said Kingston . " There wo n't be anybody much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreed , and they selected two big , overstuffed chairs in a corner . Across the room a college boy was talking with his father and mother . People crossed the lounge on their way from the dining-room to the lobby . For half an hour there was talk and movement ; then the quiet was almost complete . Kingston and Tommy had the lounge to themselves . " I 'd forgotten , " said Tommy , " how lovely Hanover is . I 'd forgotten particularly how restful and quiet it is . Somehow only the exciting moments had stuck iri my memory . Right now I envy you . Life must be very pleasant up here . " " It is , " Kingston said placidly , " if you like to teach and if  | you like college boys . I happen to , and so I 'm more contented than some of my colleagues . Some of them miss the excitement of a city , you know , and a few of them do n't really care very much about teaching ; they 're interested mainly in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ though . For an undergradute college we have our share of scholars , I think , but we do n't have much patience with men who slight the students . Most of us take teaching seriously ; and if you do , this is a grand place to work and live . " " But is n't it an awful grind ? " Tommy asked . " I 've seen your desk simply stacked with themes , and most of them must be dull . How do you stand marking misplaced commas and dangling participles year after year ? " " The themes are n't dull if you 're interested in the fellows who wrote them  --  and I am . Sometimes , of course , I bellyache with the best of them , but you 'd be surprised at how often I 'm really eager to get at a batch of themes , especially if they show a reaction to a class discussion . No , Tommy , I do n't find my work a grind most of the time . Usually I 'm keen about it . And it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just repetition , but it is n't . I go over the same material year after year ; that 's true  --  but I go over it with different students . Every year a college is rejuvenated . It is always young . The students always run largely to type , of course , as all humanity does , but within the type they are infinitely varied . And I like them . Probably I 'm a little sentimental about them . I 'm enormously pleased when an old grad looks me up . I hope you would have . " Tommy shook his head and grinned shamefacedly . " I doubt it , " he confessed . " I wanted to , all right , but I 'd have been afraid you might have forgotten me . " Kingston laughed . " I know how you feel . We never quite get over our fear of our old teachers . I do n't know why , but we do n't . I remember once being in Cambridge . I wanted terribly to see Dean Briggs , but I was afraid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Then he stopped me in  | the Yard . I was pleased to my toes and terribly ashamed . " " That 's exactly the way I felt this afternoon when you spoke to me , " Tommy said . " But I want to ask you something . Do you do any scholarly work  --  any writing , I mean ? " " Very little . I dig up something interesting now and then and write it up for a learned journal , and I 've edited a couple of books . Why do you ask ? " " Well , I 'm wondering what you 're working for . That 's pretty personal , but I came up here to find out if I could what I was working for . I have a right to feel that I 've done well , but I do n't . A couple of months ago I was made a member of the firm , and it 's a firm anybody would be proud of . I 've got what I wanted , and now I do n't see just what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ money , of course . Now , the amount of money a professor can get is pretty strictly limited , and at best it is n't much . I know you work hard ? probably harder than I do , and there must be something besides money that you 're working for . You could make more money doing something else . You have the friendship of the students , I know , but a lot of them must disappoint you  --  and you must give up a lot , too , that you must want . " Kingston nodded thoughtfully , and then smiled at Tommy , his dark eyes twinkling behind his glasses . " In other words , " he asked , " where is my ambition ? " " Oh , I did n't mean ? " " No ; you just implied . Never mind ; it 's quite all right . Have you ever asked yourself just what ambition means to most people ? " " Well , " said Tommy , " I 've asked myself what it means to me , and I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't want to be Dartmouth 's second Daniel Webster ? " " No . I know I do n't want to be that . I do n't quite know why not , either ; but I think I have an aversion to any kind of public demonstrativeness . At any rate , I know I have no desire to go into public life . "  | Kingston studied him . " Perhaps , " he remarked shrewdly , " that 's why you are n't sure where you 're going . " " I 'm afraid I do n't understand . One can get somewhere privately , surely . " " We were talking about ambition , " said Kingston , " and an ambitious man does n't want to go anywhere privately . It 's his privacy he objects to . He wants to be known , to be admired , to have wealth or power or both . Ambition means that a man wants to stand out , and he ca n't stand out without being noticed  --  and if he did stand out without being noticed , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , I think perhaps you are too well balanced to need ambition . Ambition , you know , is so often a compensation for something lacking . " " Perhaps , " Tommy admitted , " but surely that is only a small part of the explanation . Certainly it does n't explain the great majority of ambitionless people , and that 's most of the people . " " Is it ? I doubt that . I think most people want to stand out for some reason or other , but most of them want to stand out in their own very tiny worlds . But , never mind ; we wo n't argue about that . You asked me what I got out of my ambitionless life . " " I did n't say that . I asked ? " " I know , " interrupted Kingston , " but that was in your mind . Well , everything you said about my teaching was entirely true , and I think that down in your heart you still have a little of the common contempt for people who bury @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are escaping life rather than living it . Some remnant of Browning 's philosophy must have stuck with you from your classes with me . " " Browning ? You mean the success in failure philosophy you used to talk about ? " " Yes  --  and I 'm still talking about it . You feel with him that it is better to aim for a million and miss it than try for a  | hundred and get it  --  and you think I 'm trying for about fifty . Well , I 'm not . But I 'm a teacher , you see  --  and a teacher aims for others , not for himself . Oh , of course , I want to be the teacher of my dreams and all that sort of thing , but the dream merely raises my standard for inspiring the students . " " That means , does n't it , " interjected Tommy , " that you 're sinking your personality in others ? " " No ! It means that I 'm trying to inspire others through my mind and personality , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in my work and merely earning a living from it . Of course , there are disappointments . I always rather shrink when the alumni come back for reunion . It 's a shock to see most of them ten years later . It 's the exceptional undergraduate who does n't have something fine in him , some ambition or idealism that makes him worth while ; but most men of thirty or forty have lost the idealism . It 's nearly always a shock to me to meet alumni I have n't seen for ten years . A fellow graduates young and slim and hard ; he comes back soft  --  soft all through . Oh , not all of them , of course . You have n't , for example . You look much the same as you did when you were a senior , and I think you are much the same . " " I 'm afraid I am , " said Tommy ruefully . " I 've been wondering if I were n't suffering from a second adolescence . " " I doubt it . Your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ growing , that you have n't given up . If that means immaturity , I think you 're lucky . Do you know what most people mean when they say they 're mature ? " He did n't give Tommy a chance to answer ; he answered his own question . " They mean that they 've succeeded in justifying their own incompetence and failures and prejudices to themselves . It means that they are smug , completely satisfied with the dogmas they call their ideas . Remember , Tommy , ' adolescent ' comes from olescere , meaning to grow , and that ' mature ' comes from maturus , meaning full-grown or ripe . Well , there 's no growth after full growth , and there 's nothing but  | rot after ripeness . A man at your age ought to be intellectually still adolescent . If he is n't , lie 's already ready for the dustbin . " Tommy thought that over . If Kingston was right , there was consolation and encouragement in what he said , but he was n't sure Kingston was right . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seem a good deal more assured than I feel . " " Most men , " said Kingston sharply , " are assured because they are n't trying for much . Most of them are n't trying for much besides physical pleasure . They would n't admit it , but actually their only ambition is for money , and their only use for the money is to buy better seats at more night clubs , and to buy more liquor and more women . " That statement Tommy refused to believe . " I do n't think that 's true of most of the men I see , " he objected , " ? around the Harvard Club , for instance . A few of them are like that , but they 're the exceptions . " " You do n't see many of the failures around the New York Harvard Club . " Kingston pointed his pipe at Tommy for emphasis . " Most college men fail . Most people fail . You 're a success , and probably most of your friends and acquaintances are successes , too . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't successes , and their failure sticks out all over them . I do n't mean they 've failed to make money . I 'm too academic to make money a standard . I mean they 've failed to find a purpose in life , any significance in it . Their intellectual vitality is all gone and  --  probably I 'll seem sentimental when I say their dreams are gone too . That to me is when a man fails  --  when he has lost his dreams . " Tommy wanted to say that he was a total failure by Kingston 's definition , but he found the confession impossible . It would demand an explanation that would reveal more than he was capable of revealing to any one . And so instead of saying anything , he lighted a cigarette and waited for Kingston to continue .  | " That 's why the life up here suits me to perfection , " Kingston explained . " I work with people whose dreams are terribly real to them . Most of them are almost frighteningly alive . And my colleagues are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . They are intellectually alive , I mean . Some of those who are dullest in the classroom are tremendously stimulating out of it . They just do n't know how to talk to students . And I 'm part of a community . I have roots . I live in beautiful surroundings . My children are growing up in the finest kind of atmosphere . I rub hard against my fellows . Sometimes , I 'll admit , the rubbing chafes horribly . There 's another side to academic life , but I escape it pretty well . And the students are always there to make the chafing worth while . Why , Gray , I ca n't tell you the satisfaction I experience when one of my students goes out and justifies my faith in him . I have a kind of success by proxy . I know I did n't create the success , but I helped  --  and once in a while one of my former students goes out of his way to let me know I helped . That means more than I know how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said Tommy thoughtfully , " that there must be enormous satisfaction in helping others to live a full life , but we ca n't all have that kind of work . For that matter , not many people are fitted for it  --  and lots of people who try it out of , the kindness of their hearts merely ball things up and get in the way . Certainly , my work is n't like that . It has a small human side , but it 's mostly technical . I ca n't pretend to get your kind of satisfaction out of it . " " Well , what matter ? " asked Kingston . " You like it , do n't you ? " " Oh , yes , very much , but after what you 've said it seems pretty selfish . " Kingston smiled . " We all have our doubts occasionally . " " You mean , " Tommy asked slowly , " that all of us wonder sometimes if our work is worth doing  --  that everybody feels once in a while that life is hollow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that way now and  | then . Probably it 's their livers . I do n't know . But , anyway , it 's mostly foolish doubt , I think , because any work is important if it does n't do anything more for us than earn us a living . And if we do the work well , it 's important to others , too . It 's bound to be . No work exists independent of humanity . " Tommy began to discuss his work as an attorney , not because he particularly wanted to , but because he had talked around the questions in his mind as long as he could . Much as he liked Kingston , he could not really confide in him ; and he could n't get closer to the vital questions without revealing far more than he was willing , or temperamentally able , to reveal . And the solution Kingston had found for himself , he felt sure , was no solution for him . A year later he found significance in Kingston 's remarks that he missed entirely at the moment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in other people no doubt made Kingston the stimulating teacher he was , but Tommy ( lid not believe that he could acquire that interest . He did n't want to be a teacher . Kingston was valuable . Tommy prized him . Undoubtedly scores of his former students prized him as highly ; but the qualities that made him so valuable were qualities that Tommy lacked , and he was n't sure that lie even wanted them . As men they could touch hands , like each other , come close to understanding each other , but Tommy did not believe Kingston could really understand the tangle of problems that were making his life a meaningless snarl . Kingston would speculate interestingly about those problems , but the speculations could n't possibly be personal enough to offer a solution . That , Tommy began to feel sure , he would have to find for himself .  | TOMMY relaxed comfortably on his way back to New York . He stared out of the window at the loveliness of the Connecticut Valley and let his thoughts drift around his visit to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him , he had called on several of his former professors and found a hearty welcome waiting . A clerk in a drugstore called him by name ; so had a barber . The visit had done him a lot of good . He had enjoyed every minute of it . ... But he had n't done what he had meant to do . He had n't thought about his undergraduate ambitions and yearnings . He had n't stepped back in time ; indeed , he had never been more intensely his own age . Dartmouth had not revived his youth in him ; it had made him , instead , sharply aware of his maturity . He wondered if he would have enjoyed a discussion , an old-fashioned bull session , with a group of students . He doubted it . They all looked so damned young . And he knew that they would have said things that would have made hint feel shopworn and grimy . They would have made him feel disillusioned , unduly sophisticated . Not that plenty of undergraduates did n't think their sophistication was complete @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought his sophistication was equal to any one 's . As if a night with a woman really stripped away your illusions . . . . It taught you something about yourself , perhaps , but that was all . No , he was glad he had n't had anything to do with the students . If he had had , he would have felt older than ever , and that was the last thing he wanted .  | Funny , his talks with the professors had n't made him feel young . He had felt some of the gawkiness of his undergraduate days , but nothing more . The changes in the professors had made him almost uncomfortably aware of the passage of time . They looked older . He knew that he must look older , too . Well , he was  --  and he had to look at life from the point of view of a man . It was silly to think he could go back and look at it from the point of view of a boy . One never could go back . The last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Gray attorney was a very different person from Tommy Gray of Dartmouth . He had n't even gone into his fraternity . He remembered too well how hollow the welcome to old grads was . . . No , he had to accept his maturity . What was it Kingston had said ? There was nothing but rot after ripeness ? Yes , but that was more of a wise-crack than anything else . It sounded wise , but he did n't believe it was . A man could be ripe a long time without rotting . And a man could grow , too , without remaining green all his life . But Kingston was no fool , far from it . He was glad they 'd had that talk . It had done something for him . The whole visit had . Once he 'd really thought it out " Is this seat taken ? " He was startled . Subconsciously he had known that the train was in the Springfield station , but his thoughts had absorbed him so completely that he had been unaware of the movements in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " he thought . " Good Lord ! " The woman looking down at him must be , he decided , as tall as he was , and he stood only a fraction of an inch under six feet . She had the warmest color in her cheeks he had ever seen ; her large eyes were black and very brilliant ; her mouth suggested decision and strength . " No , " he replied , picking up a magazine from the other half of the seat ; " no , it 's not taken . " Then , before he could rise to help , she picked up a heavyappearing  | suitcase and tossed it to the rack . With a quick movement , she pulled off a little reddish felt hat and tossed it after the suitcase . Next she slipped out of a severely tailored topcoat , folded it , and set it beside her hat . " What a woman ! " Tommy thought . At the moment he hardly knew whether she was beautiful or not ; he could not form immediately an estimate of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ woolen skirt and a rust-colored pull-on sweater . Her shoulders were magnificent , her body Amazonian . Her straight , lustrous black hair was cut almost as short as a man 's , parted on the side and swept back in a shining wing . Tommy tried not to stare , but it was hard to look away ; she was such a lot of woman . " Would you like to sit by the window ? " he asked . " The view is beautiful . " " No , thanks , " she replied , and he was caught by the beauty of her voice . It was a rich contralto , dark and velvety . " For the present I 've had my fill of views . " He looked at her inquiringly and she explained , " I 've been up in the Berkshires painting , and right now I feel saturated with color . I have a stack of canvases tied together back in the baggage car . " Tommy wanted to make her talk so that he could listen to the music of her voice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 've been up to Hanover , and the colors were marvelous . Of course , they 're past their prime , but I 'd have given a lot to have been able to paint them . " " I like them best when they 're faded a little , " the big woman said , " and there 's a blue smoky haze at this time of year that does things to them . " For the first time she looked at him directly . " Do you know about painting ? " she demanded , and Tommy thought he detected a challenge in her voice . He smiled at her . " It depends on what you mean . I 've been through all the great galleries in Europe a good many times . One of the masters at prep school got me interested  | in painting when I was about sixteen , and I 've never lost the interest . I know all the galleries in this country , too , especially those in New York . I really like pictures , but I ca n't say @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I mean . " " Technique ! " She sniffed . " I 'm fed up with technique . What good does that do you ? I 've got all the technique in the world , and I 'll probably burn all the damn daubing I 've been doing . Technique is n't worth a hoot . " Her black eyes flashed and she glowered at Tommy . " What do you want to know about technique for ? " " I do n't , " Tommy said , smiling at her indignation . " My interest in it is pretty slight . I 'm one of those people who do n't know much about painting , but I know what I like . Once in a while I think I know why . " She turned squarely in her seat and looked him over . Her scrutiny was stern and totally without embarrassment . Suddenly she smiled , and Tommy reduced her age from thirtyfive to thirty . " You sound intelligent , " she said , " and you look intelligent . Want to talk ? " " Have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " He grinned because her bluntness left him on the defensive . " You look about fifteen when you grin like that . " Her comment was as impersonal as if he were a statue . " You drop years with a thud . " She held out her big , strong hand . " My name is Mary Carter , and if you are n't in advertising , do n't pretend you 've heard of it because you damn well know you have n't . " " I have n't , " Tommy confessed , gripping her hand in return for her firm grip . " I 'm Thomas Gray , and I 'm not in advertising ; I 'm an attorney . " " Except for your mouth , you do n't look old enough . When you smile you look like a kid ; but until you do , your mouth gives you away . How old are you ? " " Twenty-nine . " Tommy wondered what she would ask  | next , but he did n't much care ; this magnificently big woman was beautiful , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . She did n't ask anything . Instead she studied him for a minute or two . Then she said thoughtfully , " I 'd rather like to paint you . Your face is interesting . Your hair is a good brown , and it catches the light . There 's something candid about your eyes that 's interesting . They 're what make you look so young . They have a kind of trustful , questioning look . Your nose ? Nostrils a little thin , suggest passion . And then I 'd paint your mouth  --  pain , restraint , too damned reticent , a little tight  --  contrast with your eyes . Boy 's eyes , man 's mouth . " She seemed to become aware of him as a person and smiled at him . " Your eyes mean you stick out your chin , and your mouth means you can take it but it hurts like hell . " Tommy blushed a little and managed a small smile in response . Inwardly , he squirmed . This Mary Carter was altogether too observant and too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said because he did n't know what else to say . " You see a lot . " " I 'm a lousy painter . I told you that , did n't I ? " " No ; you said you had all the technique in the world . " " I have , but any damned fool knows technique does n't make a painter  --  or he ought to , anyway . I 'm a commercial artist and a good one . I can paint an apple so you 'll think you can eat it off the canvas , and you 'll want to , too . I can paint a woman so you 'll know how much the silk in her dress cost by the yard , and I can paint a dog so that his whiskers will wiggle . And so I make a good living , but I do n't fool myself ; I ca n't paint a picture . I 've been up in the Berkshires trying , and I 've had a swell time , too ; but I 've painted only what @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . That 's something different . " Mary Carter interested Tommy enormously , but he hardly knew how to meet her frankness . A line of poetry came providentially to his aid , and he recited softly :  | " Still what an arm ! and I could alter it . But all the play , the insight and the stretch ? Out of me ! out of me ! ' " " So you know Browning . I used to read that poem to my kid brother . Well , that gives the idea perfectly , but Browning did del Sarto dirt . He was a painter . Just the same , Browning knew what he was talking about . I could paint you , for example  --  good color , good likeness , everything , but I know damn well I 'd miss the thing that makes you an individual . I always do . I 'd paint a likeness , not you . I 'd never get what I think about you in the picture . See what I mean ? " " Yes , I see . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was afraid that she might analyze him again ; so he switched the conversation to modern methods of painting and held her to the subject until the train pulled into the New Haven station . Then she said unex-pectedly : " I hate this joint . " " New Haven ? Why , I 've always liked it . I do n't know anything I like better than the Green with its three old churches . " " I do n't mean New Haven . It 's all right , I guess . I 've never seen it . I meant Yale . I have a kid brother who graduated a year ago , and what it did to him ! I was responsible , too , and I kick my behind every time I think of it . " Puzzled , Tommy looked at her questioningly . She saw his confusion and frowned . " I sound cracked , do n't I ? " she said , a note of bitterness bringing sharpness into her rich voice . " Well , I should n't be surprised if I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chick and kicked it into the water . It 's like this : We 're from Ohio , and our folks died ten years ago , and so I had Bill ? my brother , I mean  --  on my hands . He was a swell kid , and I was nuts about him , just plain nuts . Well , I was already earning good money even if I was only twenty-three , and I  | could take care of him . He 's ten years younger than I am , and I did n't think anything was too good for him . Besides , he was gifted as hell . He could make words sing . " So know-it-all big sister sent him to Yale . Of course , he had to be ready just when the depression got to going good and all the advertisers were laying off . But I managed it . I had the devil 's own time , but I pulled him through and gave him a summer in Europe in the bargain . " And did Bill like college ! He ate it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ everything . Used to spend his vacations out on Long Island and up at Bar Harbor . He did n't touch me for that ; he was invited . He was a success , you see . Too damn much of a success ! He did n't see writing in a garret or working for a publisher when he got out . My God , no ! The depression did n't mean anything to him . He 'd made contacts in college . You know , contacts ! He got him a job with a broker , and now he goes to deb parties and hangs around the Yale Club bar . He 'll marry a rich girl and be a well-kept louse . " Again Tommy struggled for the right thing to say even while feeling uncomfortably sure that there could be no right thing . " You 're an artist , " he began tentatively , " and so writing probably means more to you than it ever meant to your brother . I 've been told that the creative faculty often dies with adolescence . I know it @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ now that I wrote in college to save my life . Probably your brother 's gone into business because he instinctively knows that 's where he belongs . " She looked out of the window and then turned to him . Her mouth was set , her eyes stern . " Ever love anybody ? " she demanded pugnaciously . " Yes . " " Know what it is to have him turn into a skunk ? " " Well  --  yes , in a way . I thought that for a time , but I was wrong . " " Maybe you can guess , then . I told you I 'd never been to  | New Haven . Did n't that strike you as funny ? Remember , I was footing the bills . Can you guess why I never went ? " " No . No , I ca n't . " " I was n't invited . " Something turned over in Tommy . He felt sick . With the unnatural speed that is common on ships and not uncommon on trains , he and Mary Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ an intimacy that was as real as it was probably temporary . He had known that sudden intimacy on trains and ships before . It was due , he supposed , partly to the unaccustomed environment , the strange and isolated world in which one was moving , and partly , too , to the fact that subconsciously one expected the intimacy to end when one left that world . He was n't particularly surprised , therefore , by Mary 's frankness , but the revelation was too intimate ; it upset him , almost repelled him . He did n't want to know what this big , handsome woman had suffered , and he was ashamed of himself for not wanting to know . The revelation embarrassed him , and he resented the embarrassment . When he said nothing , she continued , her rich voice dry with bitterness . " He was ashamed of me , you know . I was n't any more outspoken , I 'll bet , than his deb friends ; but I 'd never been a deb  --  and I 'm so goddamn big @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his swell club and around some of his swell friends . And I 'm not invited now . I see him once in a blue moon . He comes down to the studio and we have a fight . He knows what I think of his friends , and he sneers at mine . Well , he does n't get any more checks out of me , and he can rot before he 'll get one . Let 's talk about something else . I 'm sorry I shot my mouth off . " Thankfully Tommy agreed , and they made idle conversation until the train flashed past 135th Street . Then he asked if he might come to her studio and see her pictures . " No , " she said bluntly . " Now , get me right ; I like you . You 're all right . But I 've quit fooling myself about people  | like you . I 've tried being friends with your kind before , and it 's no go . I live down in the Village , and a lot of nuts @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and some of them are just nuts . But you 're so normal and wholesome you 'd make me hate the lot of them , and I do n't want to hate them . They 're my kind . " " Oh , come now , " Tommy objected ; " you 're exaggerating . I 'm not creative ; I admit it , but I am appreciative . Is n't that enough ? " " No , it is n't . Listen . " She swung around and faced him . " A person has to make adjustments . I 've made mine . I may not be a good artist , but I 'm an artist . So are my friends . Do you know what that means ? It means we 're all freaks by your standards . Somebody said some time or other that art was a diseased growth , and he was right as rain . All kinds of art come from overexposed nerves . Life hits artists too hard . If they are n't warped to begin with , it warps ' em . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like to think we 're warped . We do n't want to feel queer . So we herd together because we understand each other 's queernesses . You 're normal as sunshine , and you 'd light up all our crazy twists until we 'd hate each other . " " I think you 're cock-eyed , " Tommy remarked comfortably . " You make me sound like a prig , and you talk as if you were a circus freak . You know , do n't you , that you 're the handsomest woman that ever escaped the Follies ? " " Man o ' War escaped the Follies , too , " she replied caustically . Tommy laughed . " I suppose you 'd like to be cute and kittenish , but nobody else wants you that way , you can be sure . " He grinned his most boyish grin . " I 'm going to call . " " I 'll kick you downstairs . " " Try it . " She looked at him , and her great eyes were so soft and dark that the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ spoke , her voice was deeper even than usual , vibrant with appeal . " Honest , I 'd rather you would n't . " " You mean that ? " " Yes . Yes , I mean it . " Tommy could do nothing but accept the situation , but he was genuinely sorry . He was fascinated by Mary Carter , by her beauty , her honesty , her individuality . When they reached Grand Central Station , she permitted Tommy to accompany her to the taxi stand . They shook hands . She got into the taxi , and he stepped back . Then she beckoned to him . " Come if you want to , " she said softly , and even in the dim light Tommy could see that her cheeks were flaming . " Well , I 'll be damned , " he whispered ; " I will be damned . "  | THE day after Tommy 's return to New York , his telephone rang . " This is Gene Cantwell , " a voice said . " How are you , Tommy ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not only smelled bad but that he had smelled often before . There was a look of patient disgust on his face , a weariness with something that had to be endured . He had known Gene Cantwell at Andover , and for no reason that he understood he had been Gene 's hero . Year after year the boy had trailed after him , grateful for the slightest sign of attention . Tommy had n't let him know that he was going to Dartmouth until Gene had said that his application for Cornell had been accepted . Then he breathed a sigh of relief and fondly believed that he was rid of Gene forever . It was only a few months , however , after he came into the offices of Winchester , Winchester , and Tucker that he met Gene on lower Broadway . There was an immediate invitation to dinner , tonight , tomorrow night  --  any night . Tommy could not escape . Once that painfully tiresome evening was over , he swore that he would never spend another hour with Gene Cantwell . There never was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dull , so insensitive , so smug . Gene 's talk was all about Gene , about Gene 's collection of toy soldiers , Gene 's boat , Gene 's country home , Gene 's business , Gene , Gene , Gene , ad nauseam . If he had n't inherited money , he would probably have been a country grocer , but a lucky grandfather and a provident father had left him the  | means necessary to support an expensive , overdecorated Park Avenue apartment and an expensive , stupid wife . Fortunately for Tommy , his paths and Gene 's seldom crossed . Miles separated their offices , they did not belong to the same clubs , and they associated with few of the same people . Therefore he had to evade Gene only when Gene telephoned . Now once more Gene was calling . Tommy sighed and prepared to evade a new and pressing invitation . " I 'm well enough , " he said in response to Gene 's question , " but I 'm all-fired busy . I 've been out of town , and now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind ? " " Norma and I want you for an evening . We 've given up sending you invitations for big parties . We know you do n't like them ; so this is just an evening with us  --  dinner and then the theater if you want to go . If you do n't , we 'll just sit and talk . " " What night ? " " Wednesday of this week , Tuesday or Friday of next . Norma 's going to France the week after that and I 'm going to join her in November . We 're going to winter on the Riviera . " " Thank God , " Tommy thought . This was going to be simpler than he had dared hope . " Wait a minute , " he said . " Let me look at my calendar . " He let his watch tick off thirty seconds and then added . " No can do , Gene . I have to go to Scarsdale Wednesday night ; next Tuesday I 'm going to the Thiesel party , and the Friday after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a girl ; so I ca n't get out of it . Thank your wife for me , wo n't you ? " For several minutes Gene urged that an engagement be broken , but Tommy assured him earnestly that he could n't possibly break these engagements . Eventually Gene accepted defeat , promising to call Tommy immediately on his return from Europe . Tommy replaced the instrument in its cradle and leaned  | back in his chair . He felt tired . Telling social lies was not easy for him , though the first two engagements had been real enough . He must make a note to ask somebody to go to the fight . The chances were more than good that Gene would go himself , and if he did , he would search Madison Square Garden for Tommy . Well , Tommy thought , that was one good thing about New York  --  the ease with which one could escape people one did n't like . In a town of even a hundred thousand people he would be seeing Gene Cantwell constantly ; the evasion would be impossible @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ New York one could usually slip away from them if they did n't work in the same office . He met them in his clubs , said a polite word , pleaded an engagement , and fled . Pretty largely he went where he wanted to go , associated with the people he enjoyed knowing . New York 's size , distances , mobs , were sometimes depressing , but they left a man freer than he could be anywhere else in the world . II Tommy had meant to call on Mary Carter very soon after his return from Hanover , but for several weeks he was busy and she slipped from his mind . He did , however , mention her once to Fred Homans while they were dressing after playing squash . " Mary Carter ? " said Fred . " Sure I know her . Everybody in advertising knows her . She 's one of the best . " " You mean as an artist ? " " Sure , and as a business woman , too . Mary 's got brains . She understands what you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd make a swell advertising man . Got ideas , you know . And she knows how to do business . No feminine lures or any of that tripe . Knows what she wants . Makes you come through  --  and sticks to her end of the bargain . Mary 's all right . When 'd you meet her ? "  | " On the train coming back from Hanover . I thought she was quite a person . " Fred chuckled . " All of a hundred and sixty pounds of person , I 'd say . But , man , is n't she an eyeful ? " Tommy agreed and made a mental note to telephone Mary soon , but engagements piled up on him and he forgot . Everybody he knew was back in town , and he knew a great many people . Besides , he received many invitations from people he did not know . He was that most sought after of all people in New York , an eligible bachelor . Sometimes he was amused by the flood of invitations that began to pour in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of them came , and he found little for satisfaction in the reason . He had Dartmouth and Harvard degrees ; he belonged to a good fraternity and acceptable clubs ; he was connected with a firm of attorneys whose senior members were in the Social Register ; and , presumably , he had some money . If his manners had been bad and his appearance unpleasing , he would have received a large proportion of the invitations just the same . From his college days he had been on the lists for debutante parties , and so the invitations were largely impersonal . As he once put it , he was on the Social Sucker lists . The debutante parties no longer interested him , and in the previous year he had not attended a single one . This year a famous rich girl was making her debut . He thought he might go to her party ; it promised to be a good show . The remaining invitations he tossed without an instant 's regret or hesitation into his waste-basket. ' lucre were many other invitations , however , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ games , to the theater , to small dances , and to dinner . He accepted enough of them to fill his evenings . In the past he had always kept at least one evening a week free , but now , even while contemptuous of the cowardice that made him do it , he stuffed his calendar . Once he had learned to live without Polly , he promised .  | himself , he would keep evenings for himself again . Until then , though , it was better not to be much alone . November passed . He had Thanksgiving dinner with the Frederick Winchesters in their home in Bronxville . He had gone to New Haven for the Yale-Dartmouth game and seen Dartmouth defeated once again . Craig Sherman , who was from Yale , had taken ten dollars of his money with loud cries of triumph , and Charlie Lovett took ten more , though he assured Tommy that he took them only out of loyalty to his alma academic mater . He had gone with them after the game to Charlie 's college club . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of good days in the office and out of it , too many good days . Early in December Tommy realized that he was getting tired , that he needed more sleep and more genuine relaxation , more time to himself , more time for thought . He had eluded thought until it began to seem attractive again , even necessary . " Thought , " he decided , smiling to himself at the strained simile , " is a lot like a girl . If you run away from it long enough , the first thing you know you find yourself running toward it . I 'll be dating Harriet again the first thing I know . " But he did n't date Harriet . Another girl , maybe , but not Harriet Carrington . This time , he assured himself , he had learned his lesson . Besides , for the moment he was tired of girls , tired of dinners , expensive glamour , casual conversation . " I 'd like , " he thought , " a long evening in a smoky room with a gang of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a note for Maribelle . He had his gang ; Maribelle would see to it that they ate and drank well . III A few days later he finished a conference with Nicholas Tyckman in his office . It was five o'clock . They leaned back in their chairs , grinned wearily at each other , and relaxed . " That 's all , I think , " said Tommy . " So far as I know , " agreed Tyckman . " I wonder at you .  | My aunt 's gift for tangling her affairs evidently did n't desert her even in death . How you 've ever straightened out the mess , I do n't know , but you seem to have done it . " " Only the broad outlines , " confessed Tommy , laughing . " The details are another matter . But I do n't think there 's anything more we can do today . " Tyckman stood up . " I should say not . I 'm dizzy . Come on over to the Yale Club with me and have a drink . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Tommy accepted the invitation without argument . He liked Tyckman , though the aunt 's estate was their only connection . Tommy rarely entered the top social stratum where Tyckman moved by right of wealth and ancestry , but he had found the man pleasant and without condescension . The Yale bar was crowded , but they managed to get their drinks and to back off into an open space . Tommy noticed a young man standing with a group a few feet away . He was talking , and the others were listening , interrupting occasionally with shouts of laughter . The young man was so handsome that he would have stood out in any company . He was tall , an inch or two over six feet , and a good tailor had done credit to a remarkably well-proportioned body . Tommy thought he had never seen more splendid shoulders . For that matter , everything about the young man was splendid . IIe was far handsomer than a movie star and without most movie stars ' suggestion of perfumed prettiness . If there had been a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cheeks , he would have lost something of his masculine vigor ; but the glossy hair was quite straight and his cheeks an even warm olive . His straight nose was big enough to give character to his face ; his eyes were blue-gray , and his teeth dazzlingly white . When he smiled , his whole face seemed to be alight with happiness and humor . Charm radiated from him . " Do you know that fine-looking chap over there with the million-dollar smile ? " Tommy asked Tyckman . " I 'm sure  | I 've never met him , but there 's something familiar about him . I suppose I 've noticed him in a crowd somewhere . Once seen , he 's not likely to be forgotten . " Tyckman followed Tommy 's glance and said , " Oh , you mean young Carter . No , you ca n't forget him . He 's the handsomest man in the Club and one of the most popular , too . Graduated a year or two ago , I believe , and is with somebody or other downtown @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . You ca n't help it . He 's on his way . " Carter ? That explained it . Mary 's brother . Of course . He was the man , Tommy thought , that Mary ought to have been . " I 've never seen him before , " Tommy explained , " but I 've met his sister . That 's the reason I thought I 'd seen him ; the resemblance is remarkable . " Tyckman lifted his blonde eyebrows . " She must be something to see , then . " " Believe me , she is . " Just then , the story over , the group broke up , and young Carter approached Tyckman and Tommy . " How do you do , Mr. Tyckman , " he said , a pleasant hint of deference in his voice . Tyckman was forty . " Hello , Carter . This is Thomas Gray . He 's just been telling me he knows your sister . " Bill Carter held out his hand to Tommy and looked at him in surprise . " Mary ? I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " The tone was light , casual , but its very lightness irritated " Tommy . Remembering what Mary had said about her brother , he thought it implied condescension ; and Bill ' Carter , even though he might be the Club 's pet and Society 's darling , was in no position to condescend to Mary . " Why not ? " he asked briefly . " Oh , you do n't look like a Villager . " " I 'm not one . But one does n't have to be a Villager to  | know your sister and admire her . Or , " he added with a little bite in his tone , " does one ? " Confused , young Carter glanced at Tyckman . Obviously he did n't know what to make of this man Gray . If Nicholas Tyckman sponsored him , he must be a little better than all right . Tyckman was a famous snob , and everybody knew that he did n't drink with his inferiors . Tyckman was watching him , and so he turned to Tommy . " Oh @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , smiling a little to hide his embarrassment . " It 's just that I ca n't stomach most of Mary 's friends . She 's always surrounded with a bunch of short-haired women and long-haired men . Her studio 's a regular Midway , it 's so infested with freaks . " Tommy ignored the explanation . " Miss Carter , " he explained to Tyckman , " is an artist , and Fred I Ionians tells me she 's a remarkably good one . I have n't seen any of her work myself , but I ca n't imagine her doing anything fussy or clumsy . " " You can bet she does n't , " said Bill . " She knows her stuff , but , just the same , she does have the damnedest friends . " " What 's the matter with them ? " Tyckman asked suddenly . " Oh , you know what you find down in the Villagefifth-rate writers and tenth-rate artists , most of ' em  --  and nine-tenths of them queer as hell . I do n't know how Mary @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Tommy watched him with sharp interest . He knew the man 's reputation for snobbery , and he suspected that it was about to he revealed . " You do n't expect artists to behave like brokers , do you ? " Tyckman asked , a challenge in his heavy voice . Then before Bill had a chance to answer , he asked another question , brutal in its demand : " Is your sister a freak , too ? " Bill flushed , and Tommy took pity on him . " Miss Carter , " he said quickly , " is a remarkable person . She is talented , of course , and she has brains . That ought to be enough , but it  | is n't . Do you remember Dolores in the Follies years ago ? " " Do I ? " said Tyckman . " Well , rather ! " " Well , I was only a kid when I saw her , but she was the kind you never forget . Miss Carter comes mighty near to being her equal . " Bill Carter @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was smiling because he was pleased or because he was trying to mask embarrassment . Tyckman turned to Bill . " Why , then , " he demanded , " do you keep her hidden ? She must be something to be proud of . " With an adroitness that Tommy was forced to admire Bill turned Tyckman 's heavy verbal saber aside . " Try to get Mary uptown ! " He laughed lightly at the idea . " If I asked her to go to a cocktail party , she 'd blast me out of the studio . She has less use for my crowd than I have for hers , and she has lots of words to tell me what she thinks . " Tommy laughed . " She has the words , all right , " he confessed and glanced at his watch . " I 've got a dinner engagement and a crowd coming up later . I 've got to be going . " Then to Tyckman he added , " We 'll want to get together again sometime next week . I 'll let @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Good-bye . " Five minutes later Tommy was in a telephone booth calling Mary Carter . He was heartily ashamed of himself . He ought to have called her long before . When she answered , he said , " This is Thomas Gray  --  the man on the train , you know . " " I have n't forgotten . What brought me to your mind all of a sudden ? " " You 're putting me on a spot with that question , but I 'm going to be honest and take the consequences . I 've been busy as the devil since I got back , because I was a fool and accepted a lot of invitations I did n't care anything about . Now I 've canceled about half of them and I can look around me again . "  | " Is that what brought me to mind ? " Tommy laughed . " Back I go on the spot , do n't I ? No ; it was n't that . It 's something else . By accident , I 've just met your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Your breath must smell of Yale Club liquor . " " It does . But let that pass . Could I call tomorrow night ? " The silence following his request lasted so long that he said , " Hello . Hello . " " Hello , " she replied . " I 'm here . I 'm thinking . Anyway , I 'm trying to . You know , I think it would be a damn dumb thing for you to call . " " I 'd like to argue that out in person instead of over the telephone . " " Well , come if you want to  --  but you wo n't enjoy yourself . People are always barging in here , and you wo n't like ' em . " " My tastes are more catholic than you think they are . " " Like fun ! Wait a minute ! What 's that Dartmouth song I 've heard ? Oh , yes , I know . With the granite of New Hampshire in our muscles and our brains . ' That 's you to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her . Somehow she seemed different talking into a telephone from what she had on the train . She must be a very complex person . He began to look forward to his call with unexpected eagerness . Tommy had five guests that evening . He had planned on only four , but Mr. Tucker had remarked during the day that his wife had gone on a cruise to Bermuda . Tommy had immediately felt sorry for him . He always felt sorry for Tucker when Mrs. Tucker was mentioned . " She 's going for her health , " Tucker had explained . And  | Tommy had thought , " And it wo n't be her fault if she does n't begin taking the tonic the first night out . " He remembered something Craig Sherman had once said to him and Charlie Lovett : " If you ask me , and I take it you do , Evelyn Tucker 's a trifle nympho  --  if you know what I mean , and you damn well do know . Every time Tucker takes me to his place for dinner , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do n't know where to look . " Tommy had suffered Craig 's experience more than once . Mrs. Tucker was ten years her husband 's junior . In a fullblown , large-breasted , flamboyant way she was handsome ; but her smiles at younger men were too eager , her eyes too bright when they were present . And she was what Tommy called a toucher . At the dinner table , her foot happened to touch his ; her hand happened to touch his ; and with each accidental touch there was a smile . She sang rather prettily , and on one occasion  --  just one ? he offered to accompany her . Later , he wondered how he managed to read the notes and to play them . Apparently she became shortsighted , for she leaned forward , far forward , to see the music ; and in leaning , her breast pressed hard and often against his shoulder . Martin Tucker sat , watched , and listened . He must know what she was doing , Tommy thought unhappily . Tucker was far too shrewd and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man , usually dry in his manner , often sardonic . Yet , Tommy thought , he might enjoy an evening with younger men . At any rate , it would take his mind off of what his wife was probably doing . It would n't hurt to ask him , anyway . " I 've got four fellows coming in this evening , " he said . " I do n't think you know any of them except Craig Sherman . Fred I Ionians , who 's a couple of years older than I am , is coming . He 's in advertising . And Walter Newton . He 's with the Steplanders downtown . He went to Cornell , but I knew him in law school . And Stephen Austin . He was ? "  | " The man who wrote Sere and Yellow ? " Tucker broke in . " Yes . It 's his first novel . It got good reviews , but it is n't selling . " " I 've read it . It 's a good book . How old is he ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dartmouth . " " I 'd like to know him . It 's a good book . " " Well , that 's what I have in mind . The fellows are coming around tonight . The idea is supposed to be poker , but they 're a great gang for talking . I wondered if you would like to come , too . " When Tucker smiled , his lined face seemed to crack . His head was bald , his forehead very broad , his eyes small and sharp under overhanging dark eyebrows . His broad forehead and big nose made his thin face seem very narrow , and his thin mouth looked bitter . He was the keenest lawyer in the place , the most scholarly and the shrewdest . He was so observant and so sensitive to facial expressions that he often seemed clairvoyant . Tommy sometimes wondered why he had come into a firm with the two Winchesters and spent his talents on law largely concerned with estates . lie would have been brilliant and devastating in a courtroom . Like all the people in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ afraid of him . Now , suddenly and unexpectedly , the harsh lines in Tucker 's face broke into a smile surprisingly warm . " I 'd like very much to come , " he said with a frank pleasure as surprising as his smile . " I have n't had an evening like that in years . It was kind of you to think of me . " Tommy assured him of his own pleasure , but inwardly he wondered how Tucker would fit into the group . Both Fred Homans and Craig Sherman were great story-tellers , and their stories usually had a Rabelaisian vigor that Tucker might find a little strong . Walter Newton was conventional enough , but Steve Austin was openly , often belligerently , a Communist . Tucker knew a vast amount about Russia . He and Steve might clash . Worse , Steve was an avowed pacifist ,  | and Tucker had been an infantry major in the World War . Tommy wondered if he had n't made a mistake . Before the evening was over , he discovered that four years of association @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as an introduction to the man . Tucker arrived later than the others , and Craig was matching Fred story for story when Tucker appeared . He acknowledged the introductions to the three men he had not met before and then said , " I heard laughter when I was in the hall . If I 'm stopping good stories , I 'm leaving now . " Craig looked startled . Tell a smutty story to Tucker ? Catch him ! But Fred Homans did not work for Winchester , Winchester , Tucker , and Gray ; so he shared none of Craig 's timidity . He had had a story on the tip of his tongue when Tucker had arrived , and it slipped off with glib ease . High as long-hung meat , it demanded a strong stomach . Both Craig and Tommy glanced uneasily at Tucker . He sipped the drink Tommy had given him , eyed Homans from under his brows , and waited for the point . It came  --  so unexpected that it was like an explosion . In spite of his concern , Tommy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ measure of control , he turned to see how his eldest guest was taking the joke . It was a laugh bomb , all right , but it gave off a lot of smell . Tucker was roaring , but his reaction was n't as startling as Craig 's . That young man was staring at Tucker as if he had seen a miracle . He had felt the bite of Tucker 's sarcasm more than once . Now he was seeing something , hearing it , but he did n't believe it . Afraid that Tucker might notice Craig 's amazement , Tommy sought to attract attention to himself as soon as the laughter had subsided . " You know , " he said , " I 'm fascinated by the psychology of dirty stories . It goes without saying that at least ninety  | percent of the really good stories are dirty . To get a really comic shock , you have to use sex . I 've often wondered why . " " So have I , " said Stephen Austin . " It 's something a writer @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no comic writer . Just the same , that sex shock is something every serious writer uses because it 's a part of life . I do n't mean he uses it necessarily to shock his readers . Not that at all , but he has to recognize its effect on his characters . " Tucker nodded his head and pressed his lips tight together before speaking . " Yes , " he said ; " you 're right , and I thought you used it admirably in Sere and Yellow . You mean John 's reaction , do n't you , to the girl 's naive statement about the rutting bitch ? " " Now , that was neat , " thought Tommy , noting Austin 's pleased smile . " He gave Steve a nice compliment without making him self-conscious . " Walter Newton , who usually said little , spoke up before Austin could reply . " There 's a perfect example , " he said . " Just those words , rutting bitch , ' give me a shock  --  and I have n't an idea why @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them have connotations for me that sort of make me squirm . You could n't do it with words that did n't suggest sex . There are n't any other words that 'll do it . " " Right , " said Craig , gathering courage from Tucker 's apparent mellowness . " And the only theory I 've heard is cockeyed . A psychology professor in college said the shock was due to repression . He said that people who lived a perfectly natural sex life did n't get a kick out of sex stories . Why , I know a man ? " " I know Fred , " Tommy broke in , laughing . Fred Homans joined in the laughter that burst around him , and his pale skin flushed . " All right , " he said when the laughter subsided , " all right ; I admit it . I live a perfectly natural sex life , and nobody gets a bigger kick out of a good dirty story than I do . Why ? Hell , I do n't know . " " I think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm wrong ,  | but I have a theory that 'll hold some water at least . I agree with Sherman that the psychologist is wrong about repressions , though I think the shock is very often so great to repressed people that they ca n't see the humor . Indeed , they are often nauseated by stories that are howlingly funny to the rest of us . " No , it is n't that . Sex is like God . We do n't understand it . It 's mystery ; it 's life . We can swear only two ways , you know : by God and by sex . Did you ever think of that ? We can be obscene and profane ; we ca n't be anything else  --  I mean anything else objectionable . Or , put it this way : We ca n't be anything else that will bring a strong shock . We can offend other ways , but we ca n't really shock without being either profane or obscene . " " You 're right , " Austin agreed thoughtfully . " I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right . And profanity has largely passed out of existence because so many people have done away with God . When I was a child , ' by God ' was a terrible thing to say . So was Christ ' or Jesus . ' You do n't find Dickens or Thackeray using words like that . I do n't suppose they dared write them or a publisher print them . Now you hear girls saying Christ ' as casually as they say darling ' or damn . ' " " Yes , " said Tucker , " damn ' and hell ' used to be associated with religion , with God , and so they were strong words , even terrifying words to lots of people . Now they 're just rather mild expletives . Tommy , could I have another drink ? " " Indeed you can . Rye again ? " " Yes , thanks . " He held out his glass to Tommy and turned to Austin . " Do n't you agree with me ? " " Yes , but your explanation does n't seem quite @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex tabus , too , but obscenity remains . Publishers will print almost any word now , I 'll admit , but the words still seem dirty . "  | Tucker waited until Tommy had filled his glass and handed it to him ; then he explained . " But , you see , we ca n't do away with sex . It 's always there with all its terrible power . As I said , it 's life ; it 's the eternal mystery . We may laugh at it , abuse it , try to analyze it in the laboratory , but it always escapes analysis . It 's something beyond us ; it 's the eternal hunger , the basic hunger . Flesh meets flesh  --  and a new life appears . Why , when you come to think of it , it 's so inconceivable , really , that 's it 's a marvel man ever connected the cause with the result . We do n't know why a life appears as a result of that meeting . We know the process only , not the fundamental @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ That 's the reason , I think , it forms the basis for most great tragedies and the funniest stories . It has the greatest power to shake us to tears or laughter because it is the greatest , the most inexplicable power . " There were half a dozen comments Tommy wanted to make , several questions he wanted to ask , but a cross-current swept the conversation away from him . Stephen Austin was reminded of something , Walter Newton of something else . And that something reminded Craig , brave at last , of a story he wanted to tell . The talk whirled around , serious for fifteen minutes , frivolous for thirty . Two hours later , when all of Maribelle 's excellent sandwiches had been eaten and many drinks had washed them down , the conversation made a wide loop and circled back to its starting-point . Fred told a story of a childhood experience when a small friend had wet his pants in Sunday-school . Everybody laughed , and Craig said : " There you are , just what we were talking about a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ because we all went to Sunday-school and took it seriously . I do n't suppose it would be funny to us now . We 'd just want to take care of the kid . " " I suppose the Sunday-school teacher felt that way , too , "  | Tommy said , " though if she was like some of the old girls , she probably felt that there was some sacrilege in it . People felt that way about churches twenty-five years ago . " " Some still do . " Craig turned to Tommy . " Look at Charlie . Remember how he sounded off here one night ? But most people our age do n't . I 'll admit that . We had God when we were kids , and I 'll be damned if I know where we lost Him . " Tucker put down his glass . " You never had Him , Sherman , the way my generation did . We 're the ones who lost Him ; you 've never really had Him . That 's why you do n't know where or how @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " I do n't understand , sir , " Craig said . " I 'm ten , fifteen , twenty years older than you men . I was twenty-five years old in 1917 ? about your age , Sherman . You were just a baby . You do n't remember the war . We lived it . " " I remember it , " Homans said . " I was only ten or twelve when we got into it , but I got a great kick out of the soldiers and marching and flags . All of us kids did . " " Yes , a great kick . So did we . " Tucker cradled his cheek in the palm of his hand . He seemed to be talking half to himself . " A great kick . It was an adventure to most of us , the adventure of a lifetime . We were full of idealism , though ; we were going to make the world safe for democracy . " He looked up , dropped his hands , and his small eyes blazed . " We were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ before . Probably you 're sick of hearing it , but you would n't be if you could understand . " " Yes , " said Tommy , " we 've heard it before , of course , but that does n't mean we would n't like to hear your side of it . " Walter Newton stirred in his chair . " I 'd like to very much , sir . You see , they 're getting ready to make soldiers out of us , and I 'd like to hear about what happened to you . "  | " It is n't what happened to me that matters , " Tucker explained . " Personal experiences are n't important . It 's what happened to all of us . You see , it was the cheating that killed God for us  --  the whole , horrible , obscene mess . You do n't know . You ca n't remember . But we were n't idiots . We heard the ministers praying for victory , praying for the destruction of our enemies . What bloodthirsty , pious devils they turned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , the Prince of Peace , they prayed that the Germans might be destroyed . And the German ministers prayed in the name of Jesus Christ that we might be destroyed . It made a lot of us sick because we believed that Jesus Christ was the Prince of Peace , and we loved Him because He was . Do you see ? We believed in the Allies ' cause , mind you . We did n't know anything about the causes of the war yet ; we were n't disillusioned yet . We were just chock full of propaganda . But we were sickened when ministers of the gospel stood in the pulpit and screamed for vengeance . We were n't ready for hate and bloodthirstiness in church . We still had God . We could still be shocked . " I know it 's an old , old platitude to say that the Christian religion has never been given a chance . It has n't , of course , but we did n't understand that then . We did n't realize that the only god we had was the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vengeance , I mean . We thought we 'd been worshiping a god of love , but the instant the little veneer of our civilization was scraped off , the truth broke out  --  and we did n't want any part of it . " Then there was the war itself . Well , never mind that . I could n't make it real to you . For no reason I can understand men are about war something the way women are about childbirth . It 's something indescribable , but once it 's over , the agony seems to be forgotten . Women welcome the next child , and men make ready for the next war . Why , God knows ; I do n't . It does n't seem possible ; it 's beyond human understanding that any one who had anything  | to do with that hideous , that utterly futile slaughter could ever even imagine another one . Imagine it ? Well , you all know what 's happening . How can they do it ? I do n't know , but if you can get your @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ saw a man killed at three minutes of eleven the morning the Armistice was signed . Thousands of men were killed that morning . Thousands ! Yet everybody knew the Armistice was to take place at eleven . Did the guns stop ? Oh , no ; the game had to be played until that last , sixtieth second . " And when the guns stopped ? What then ? Did the English soldiers hate the German soldiers ? They 'd hated each other for years , killed each other by the million ? but at the stroke of eleven they quit hating . They literally quit by the clock . If you can get your mind around anything like that , you can understand why another war is on the way . I 've been trying to get my mind around it for sixteen or seventeen years , and I have n't succeeded yet . " He threw up his arm and dropped it to his chair in a weak , futile gesture . " Then we came home , " he went on bitterly , " to find that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ find that our noble cause at best was half a lie . And ten days after the Armistice was signed we were n't heroes any more ; we were just a damned nuisance . Prohibition had been slipped over on us just as the war had been . Our women were wearing skirts up to their knees or above them and raising hell . We went for the adventure . I 'll admit that . But we went with illusions too , and when we came back we were n't ready for a world without illusions . But the Jazz Age was on . It was n't eat , drink , and be merry because tomorrow we die . No , that was war and understandable . No ; no , this was to hell with illusions , with decency , with standards because what in hell is the difference ? " That 's the world you younger men have inherited . The depression has taught us something  --  manners for one thing . There 's nothing like poverty to teach manners , but otherwise  | the disillusionment has only been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . When I was growing up , we thought we knew what we were living for , and so life had meaning . We had a god , and man needs a god . Only very unusual people can really live at peace in agnosticism , and there are n't many unusual people . Death is always waiting , and almost no one can find meaning in life without some feeling , some assurance through faith that there is some meaning . We have to have standards ; we have to have faith in our leaders  --  and my generation left mighty little to yours . I sometimes wonder what men your age find in life . " " We always have our egos , " said Austin softly . " I suppose we have substituted them for faith . " " That , " said Tucker , " reminds me of a line in a book called Queed that was popular years ago . A girl said something like this : The trouble with you , Mr. Queed , is that your cosmos is all ego . ' You do @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I think , " Tommy said , " life would mean a lot more to most of us if it did apply . " " Yes , " Tucker agreed ; " yes , I suppose it would . "  | THE next morning Tucker came into Tommy 's office . " I want to thank you for a very pleasant evening , " he said . For some reason his face seemed more heavily lined than ever ; his little eyes looked very tired . " Oh , " exclaimed Tommy , " you made the evening . " " It 's kind of you to say that . I 've rather regretted talking so much . " " Regretted ! Why , Steve and Fred hung around for an hour after you left . Craig was there for a while , too . They all said you 'd made it the best evening they could remember . Steve is very anxious to know you better , and I think you might like him . " " I 'm sure I would . Could n't you and he have dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Come out to the house , and we can have a long evening together . " " That would be fine , and I know Steve will be delighted . Besides , he needs a good dinner . " Tucker frowned . " Is he having a hard time of it ? " " Awful . He says the depression has wiped out writing as a profession , and I guess it pretty nearly has . He managed fairly well up to ' 30 selling a story now and then . Then the advertisers quit , and , of course , the magazines stopped buying . There just was n't anything he could do about it . Now he 's writing for the pulps , and he finds it mighty hard going . He has n't the knack , he says , and he has to work harder to write a bad story than he does to write a good one . I think he manages to sell a story or two a month for a cent or two a word . That just about keeps him alive . "  | @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say ? " " Yes . He got a two-hundred-dollar advance on it . He says he 'll feel lucky if he gets five hundred out of ' it altogether . " Tucker shook his head at the pitiful smallness of ' the sum . Then his eyes lighted . " How many people can you send copies to ? " he asked . Tommy smiled . " I 've already sent out fifteen , and Sere and Yellow is going to be the Christmas present I send to everybody else . " " I can probably send out twenty , " Tucker said thoughtfully . " I 'll speak to Jonathon and Frederick . A book like that ought n't to die unread , and Austin deserves encouragement . I think I can drum up a good bit of trade . But do n't say anything about it to him , " he commanded , his voice sharp with insistence . " I wo n't . When would you like to have us for dinner ? " " Arrange a date with Austin and let me know . " When @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chair . What a lot of knowing that man would take ! " I wonder , " he thought , " what he was like twenty years ago . He must have been as idealistic as all get out  --  probably is yet , though he would n't admit it . . . . " What . was that story he 'd heard when he first came into the office ? Somebody had told him something  --  something about Tucker and a girl . He 'd been engaged . No , that was n't it . Ah , now he remembered . Tucker had made one of those last-minute war marriages . He 'd sailed for France a day or two after the wedding . Then when he came back he was served with divorce papers or something of the sort when he got off the boat . No wonder he was bitter . . . It must have taken him a long time to get over that girl , because he 'd been married to Evelyn only about ten years . And look at her , cheating on him every @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Tommy had never thought of it before , but he 'd bet Tucker would like children . " I guess , " he decided , " he feels cheated out of about everything . Well , who would n't ? "  | Tommy 's taxi swung through Washington Square and stopped before a studio building . " Here you are , Mister , " the driver said . Tommy paid the fare and looked up . The building was tall and modern . " Hm , " he thought , " she must make plenty to afford a studio here . " The studio quite lived up to his expectations . It was a large room with an enormous window in the north wall . There was a model 's stand , a canvas on an easel ; otherwise there was nothing to suggest a workroom . Tommy had subconsciously expected disorder , dust , and confusion . Instead he found a well-swept rug on the floor , ash-trays that had been emptied and washed , and furniture as bright as if Maribelle herself had polished it . The pillows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Maribelle . strove for and unfortunately attained , and the magazines on a table did not overlap each other with geometrical precision ; but the studio was as neat as his own apartment without his apartment 's emptiness of personality . Mary was even more of a surprise than the studio itself . Since he had last seen her wearing a sweater and woolen skirt , he had , man-like , supposed that she would be wearing if not the same costume , something similar . Instead , she wore a gray silk dress with a dull red collar and belt . It did something to her , made her seem younger , disconcertingly more feminine . She held out her hand and smiled . " You look a little confused . What 's the matter ? " " Tommy shook hands , surrendered his hat and coat to her . " It 's you and the studio . You know how you form impressions . 1 tali ' the time there 's no sense in them , but you form them , just the same . I think I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . "  | " I do n't like messes , " Mary said . " I suppose you expected to see long-haired poets lolling on the floor eating hashish . " " Well , hardly that  --  but , well , I do n't know . " He grinned at her because he felt unsure . " I think we 'll have to start all over . You look quite different from what you ( lid on the train . I feel as if I 'd just met you . " " Embarrassed ? " The grin broadened . " A little . " " Well , so am I  --  embarrassed as the devil . I 've kicked myself a dozen times for sounding off to you the way I did ? and you look different too , older or something . Let 's have a drink . Maybe that 'll help . " Tommy glanced around the studio . " I 'd rather look at the pictures , if you do n't mind . Are these yours ? " he asked , motioning toward the walls . " No @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ arc good . Take a look . " They went from picture to picture , making appropriate and somewhat formal comments . The strain did not lessen . Instead , Tommy grew increasingly uncomfortable . lie was achingly aware of Mary as a woman , and he had not expected to be . He tried hard to think of the pictures instead of Mary . He stopped before the easel . " That 's yours , I suppose ? " " Of course . It 's a job . " Tommy studied the picture . A slender girl was half sitting , half reclining on something that so far was barely indicated . He imagined that it was a hill-top . Her thin cotton dress was pressed against her body as if by a breeze , and her long golden hair streamed behind her . The blue eyes were vague with dreaminess . " For an ad ? " " Yes . " Suddenly Mary laughed . " You ought to see the wench that 's posing for it . She 's a little slut , and her eyes look like @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was no go . Finally I copied the eyes from a photograph of a little boy . That , Mr. Thomas Gray , is commercial art . " " Well , " said Tommy , " not everybody could do it , at that . What 's this picture for ? " " A life insurance ad . It 's supposed to make fathers go dewy-eyed with tenderness , so soft that they 'll run , not walk , to the nearest salesman . Think it 'll do the work ? " Tommy wanted to say , " What does it matter ? You 're beautiful , " but he was afraid to make even a slight advance . He knew with absolute sureness that he was in that studio on probation and that he had to be a very good boy indeed if he wanted to stay there . " It might , " he said . " Anyhow , it 's certainly as skilful as I expected . Wo n't you let me see your Berkshire pictures ? " " I wrecked all but four . They made @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the others , please . I really want very much to see them . " " O.K. Have it your way . Sit down and I 'll show them . " Suddenly she whirled and said fiercely , " No pretty compliments ! You be honest ? " Her black eyes flashed and she lifted her hand significantly . Tommy suspected that she might actually strike him if he insulted her with false admiration . " I 'll be honest , do n't worry , " he said , dropping into a chair and stretching out his legs . " Just remember I 'm no critic and do n't mind anything I say . " Mary went into another room and returned with the canvases . She removed the picture of the dreamy girl from the easel and set a picture of a brilliant hillside in its place . Tommy studied it . Though he was not aware of the change , his interest relaxed him . His embarrassment faded and so did his desire to make love to Mary . The picture held his attention . He took his time @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I like it . You 're a better painter than you said you were . I expected something neat and tight  --  nothing so free  | and impressionistic . I like that picture , but I do n't want to live with it . " " Why not ? " she demanded , her eyes shining with interest . " I do n't know . It 's good painting  --  first-class painting , I think ; but  --  well , I do n't know . I 'm that way about lots of pictures . I 'd like to live with Rembrandt 's Old Lady Paring Her Nails , but I do n't want to live with his Syndics . Do you know what I mean ? " " Of course , " she said tersely and removed the picture from the easel . Tommy 's reaction to the second picture was the same as to the first ; it was the same to the third , hut the fourth made him sit up . It was smaller than the others , less ambitious . It showed a bit of a hillside @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ green tree , a sumac bush , its red faded until it was almost rusty . " That , I think , " he said , his admiration in his voice , " is a picture . That does something to me . " He looked up at her and smiled . " There 's New England in autumn in that picture  --  all of it . There 's the color and the softness and the sadness . You may not think you 're an artist , but I do . No second-rater could do that . " Mary looked at the picture for a full minute before she looked at Tommy . Her eyes were so soft that he thought there might be tears in them . Her deep voice had an organ 's richness when she spoke . " It 's the best picture I ever painted  --  and you saw . " Suddenly she threw off her emotion . " We 've got to have a drink ! You 've got taste . I 'm glad I let you come . We 'll have to celebrate . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he had passed a test , and he was glad . Mary was herself again , not the Mary he had met on the train  --  there was something different , something new and elusive  --  but she was as obviously at ease as she was obviously delighted . " I did n't want to show you my pictures , " she explained when she had brought the drinks and given him his . " I was  | afraid to . When an artist shows his picture , he shows his soul  --  and he does n't like to do that to any one he is n't sure of . I supposed you had an academic interest in painting , but that 's a long way from enough . " " I know , " said Tommy ; " it 's different from law . My work is outside of me ; yours is you . " " That 's saying it . But let 's leave me and my pictures alone . Tell me about Bill . How did you happen to meet him ? " " Why , I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Club bar and he introduced us . We just talked a minute . " " Do you know Tyckman ? " she demanded with surprising eagerness . " Only in a business way . We 're handling his aunt 's estate . Why ? " " He 's a collector , you know , and he has a John Van Eyck that I 'd give a lot to see . What 's he like ? " " To tell you the truth , I do n't know . Of course , the Tyckmans have been here since New York was a trading-post . He 's the ninth or tenth Nicholas , and he 's supposed to be an awful snob . I 've found him pleasant . He 's a big man  --  a good six-three , I 'd say . It was before my day , of course , but I know he was All America  --  full-back , I think . Let 's see . . . He 's blond , sort of a big Viking . Everything about him 's big . His features are big ; his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't think he does anything but handle the Tyckman estate , but that 's job enough for any man . I do n't know what he 's like socially . He breathes somewhere in the upper stratosphere , and I do n't . " " I low does he happen to know Bill , then ? My guess is Bill has n't got much beyond the new riches . " " I think they 're just Yale Club acquaintances , " Tommy explained . " Everybody knows who your brother is around there , I imagine . He 's so handsome he 's bound to be noticed . " Mary lit a cigarette , puffed at it until it was well alight ,  | and then asked with a casualness that seemed hardly real , " He is a beautiful animal , is n't he ? A regular collar ad . . . She paused and her face softened . " When he was sixteen , he was the handsomest , sweetest kid that ever drew breath . There never was anything like him . I  --  oh hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feel . I 'm sorry I told you about him , and I would n't have if I 'd ever expected to see you again . But I did ; so that 's that . Bill 's turned into a louse , and I might as well make my mind up to it . Only I ca n't . " " Are you sure ? " Tommy asked . " Are n't you judging him pretty severely just because he is n't what you wanted him to be ? He 's young . You ca n't tell how he 'll turn out . " I laving met Bill Carter , Tommy only half believed what he was saying . Apparently , Bill was ashamed of his sister : and if he was , he was worse than a prig ; he was a fool . Just the same , Tommy knew that he would have liked Bill Carter instantly if he had n't been forewarned about him . Mary jammed her cigarette into an ash-tray and ground it viciously . " No , " she contradicted , lifting her voice . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got a job and he 's making some money ? not much , of course , but enough to live on . He 's lucky as hell if he only knew it , but he does n't . He 's got half an eye on sister all the time . His clothes ! Do n't I know what they cost ? My God , his tailor bill his senior year ! I damn near passed out when he sent it on  --  and this studio looked like a barracks , there were so many poor devils sleeping here . I could n't get a commission for more than a tenth my price , and if the landlord had n't been the whitest man in the world , I 'd have had to give up the studio . " Well , I sold my last two bonds  --  and got fifty for them . I paid his damned tailor 's bill . But do you think he 's paying it now ? Do n't fool yourself . He 's in debt . I know he must be . You ca n't dress @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to swank parties five or six nights a week . What 's his laundry bill come to ? " " Twenty a month . Thirty maybe . "  | " Yes , and I 'll bet he owes three or four months right now . He 's hinted . He hints every time I see him . But I wo n't give him another cent . " She brought her fist down on the arm of her chair . " I damn well wo n't ! " " You would be a fool if you did , " said Tommy . " You 'd just be hurting him . I expect you 've been too good to him all along . " " I expect I have . I know part of the fault is mine . But when I think how I  --  oh , never mind . Somebody will always take care of him . " There was a knock at the door . " Damn ! I knew some fool would come in  --  and it 's too early for Hollis . " As she moved toward the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'll tell you about Hollis later . I 'm expecting her . " She opened the door and said to some one in the hall , " What 's eating you , brother ? You look sick or cock-eyed or something . " She stepped back , and a little , bedraggled youth entered the room . His face was thin and white . Even his lips were almost white . The collar of his shirt was frayed and dirty ; his pale brown hair needed cutting and combing . But there was some kind of power in his big nose and a fever in his brown eyes that caught Tommy 's attention and held it . " This funny little thing , " said Mary , towering over the poor fellow , " is Verne Ticknor . " Tommy stood up to acknowledge the introduction . " And this is Mr. Gray , Mr. Thomas Gray . Tommy , I suppose , to his friends , but we have n't got that far yet . Verne , " she explained to Tommy , " is a poet . He looks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down at little Ticknor and demanded fiercely , " Are n't you ? " " Ticknor touched Tommy 's hand weakly and said in a strangely soft voice , " Do n't be cruel , Mary . " " Cruel ? Do n't be a sensitive damn fool , Verne . Hunger knows no manners . Story come back again ? " He nodded and whispered , " Yes . " " WelI , do n't bawl about it . Better writers than you are getting their stories back these days . The magazines are just  | beginning to buy . If my bourgeois advertising agencies were n't beginning to feed them , I would n't be able to feed you . Come on out to the kitchen . Or go on out . Fat what you want  --  and do n't eat your pride with it . You know you 're welcome . " Ticknor faded like a wraith through a door . Tommy and Mary sat down again . " He starves , " she explained , " until he ca n't stand it , and it 's dangerous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they 're hungry . " She looked toward the door and lowered her voice . " He 'll make you sick , but there 's a lot of starving people who might make you sick . " " Yes , " said Tommy sharply , " and a lot of well-fed people , too . One of my best friends happens to be a hard-up writer . Please do n't judge me until you have reason to . " Mary smiled broadly . " Atta boy ! You can get mad , ca n't you ? Swell ! Well , probably your friend is a good writer . " " He is . He 's Stephen Austin . He wrote Sere and Yellow . Have you read it ? " " No , but I will if you say it 's good . But Verne , you see , is n't a good writer . Anyway , I do n't think he is . And he tries to sell Left Wing stories and poetry to capitalist magazines , and he thinks they 're vicious because they wo n't buy propaganda @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ queer . Sometimes he seems pitiful to me , and sometimes he seems like a snake some one 's stepped on . He 's too weak to strike , but , God above , how he can hiss ! " Tommy said that Austin was a Communist too , but that he divorced political theory from literature . He was trying to explain Austin 's point of view when Verne Ticknor reappeared . His pallor was less evident and his eyes looked less feverish . He threw himself down on the big couch and accepted a cigarette from Mary . Suddenly he spoke to Tommy . " You look like a Republican . " Tommy 's laughter broke from him spontaneously . The  | fellow was so little and his malice so open , so deliberately provocative , that he could n't help laughing . Ticknor 's eyes flamed and his thin cheeks reddened . " You laugh from a full belly , " he said , loading his voice with scorn . " There 's caviar and chicken a la Maryland in your pampered pot . " " Do n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Mary admonished him . " Do n't snarl at my guest just because your pride is hurt . It is n't his fault , you know . " Her words were sharp , but her voice was gentle . This , thought Tommy , was a third Mary . What was the woman really like , anyhow ? " Damn bourgeois food ! " cried Ticknor . " You sold your cowardly little soul to get it turning out saccharine tripe for lying advertisers . You painted lies just to keep your belly full . " " And yours , remember , " said Mary placidly . " Well , Verne , you ungrateful little asp , I do n't know anything about Mr. Gray 's politics , and I do n't care anything about them . This is my studio , and we 'll leave them alone . See ? Now if you 've got a poem to recite , recite it . We 'll listen and maybe we 'll like it . But you mind your manners or we sha n't listen at all . " In a gesture @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his cigarette on the rug . Mary picked it up , crushed it in a tray , and then in one stride she was at the couch . Leaning over , she gripped Ticknor 's thin shoulders , lifted him to a sitting position , and shook him until his teeth chattered . Then without a word she dropped him and returned to her chair . To Tommy 's goggle-eyed amazement , Ticknor smiled , and his eyes shone with pleasure as he rubbed his shoulders . " Mary , darling , " he said in a high , fluty voice , " you 're so impulsive . " " If you throw things on my rug , you 'll find out how impulsive I can be . I 've told you before that this is n't a joint . I'II stand you , Verne , as long as you stick to the rules . If you  | do n't , I 'll kick your little behind until you ca n't sit for a week . " " I 'd like that , " said Verne , stretching luxuriously . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ darling , and I 'll make you do it . " Through the haze of his own disgust Tommy saw Mary 's . She was controlling a repulsion as strong as his own . To what lengths , he wondered , did she carry her pity ? How could she endure this twisted , diseased , ungrateful little  --  little . . . His search for an epithet was lost in Mary 's reply . " Verne , " she said , her contralto voice deeper even than usual , " I draw a line . You 've reached it . " Her dark eyes looked into Ticknor 's . He squirmed and muttered , " Sorry , Mary . " " All right . Forget it . Now if you want to recite the poem , recite it . " Ticknor leaned on his elbow ; his eyes kindled ; his free hand stretched toward them , trembled . The flutey quality was gone from his voice . " There 's a sickle coming , Sweeping through the sky . The fat bond-holders can not hear it . The smug @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sunlight . . . . Hark , how it shrieks , Swung by the hand of God ! Please , God , let it strike soon . " His voice broke on the last line ; his eyes filled with tears . With total unexpectedness , he jumped to his feet and rushed out of the studio , slamming the door after him . There was a clatter of his feet on the stairs . Then silence . Mary and Tommy looked at each other . She shook her head . " That might seem like immortal poetry to us if we were starving , " she said softly , " and he was starving when he wrote it . " Tommy nodded in agreement . " Yes , " he said . " I understand .  | And yesterday there were millions hungry enough to think it was immortal poetry , and tomorrow there may be millions hungry enough again . Right now it does n't look like it , but it did n't look like it in ' 29 either . There 's a lot of difference between @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but Ticknor feels . He hates . He is like a wounded snake , is n't he ? " Mary stood up and moved to the window . For a time she stared out at the night ; then she turned and asked , " Why should n't he be ? He was given brains enough to know he 's a freak . Of course , he hated you . You 're everything he 'd give his soul to be , but he would n't admit it if you burnt him with fire . He ca n't strike God for what 's been done to him . He 'll do what anybody else would do : he 'll strike what he can . " Tommy hesitated to speak , but the silence lasted too long . " You have great understanding , " he said gently , " and great pity . " She lifted her hand and then let it drop to her side . Again she looked out at the night , and Tommy thought she asked , " Why not ? " " Why not ? " What @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could n't be . . . . He remembered how she had blushed when she said for him to call if he wanted to . No , that was insane . . . . But what in the devil ? An artist , she must know what a magnificent creature she was . She must know . Otherwise she could n't dress to such advantage . She knew how to set herself off . At first he had thought her close-cropped hair a mannish affectation . Now he knew better . A pug on that head ? It would be ridiculous , and so would a cluster of curls . No , she knew exactly what she was doing . Then , what in hell ? His meditations were broken by the sound of the buzzer . Mary turned . " The janitor must have shut the front door , " she said and walked across the room . She pressed a button . " That 's probably Hollis . " " A girl ? "  | " Yes . Oh , I meant to tell you about her . Now @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this much : she is n't like Verne . You can relax . Hollis is as wholesome as hominy . " She opened the door and waited . Somewhere down the corridor a sweet , clear voice cried , " Hello , Mary ! " " Hello , Hollis . My , it 's good to see you again . " " Oooh , Mary , I 've got such news ! " Tommy saw a girl , who seemed almost childishly small , put her arms around Mary . She laughed . " You 're such a lot for me to hug . " Mary 's laugh was like music . Without warning , she lifted the girl six inches from the floor and swung her into the room . " Mr. Gray , " she said , " this happy mite is Hollis Graham . Hollis , this is Mr. Thomas Gray , attorney at law and a judge of good pictures . He likes mine . " Hollis wriggled and laughed . " Juno , " she commanded , " let me down . I ca n't acknowledge @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Let me down ! I 'll call you names ! " " I 'll let it go at Juno , " said Mary . She casually lowered Hollis 's feet to the floor and watched while her embarrassed guests shook hands . " I 'm very glad to meet you , Miss Graham , " Tommy said , hardly knowing what else to say . " And I 'm glad to meet you , though an attorney is the last thing I ever expected to meet here . The depression must be over . " " Do n't crack wise , little one , " Mary ordered dryly . " Take off your hat and coat , park where you will , and tell us the good news . " She turned to Tommy and explained , " Hollis is a musician , a professional musician  --  a musician with a public , what 's more . I do n't believe Kreisler has a larger public . " She was joking , Tommy knew . The coat that Hollis Graham was throwing over a chair was cheap even to his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt hat looked old . The girl was poor . Hollis ran her hands through the mass of soft curls that hung almost to her shoulders . Her hair was light brown , and Tommy would have sworn that the curls were God-given . They had none of the ordered , rigid quality that marked even the most expensive curls produced by a permanentwave machine . Her features were small , prettily formed , her eyes blue . Probably her lips were reddened with rouge , but her cheeks were free of it . Beside Mary she looked pallid , frail and insignificant , though she was n't quite as small as Tommy had first thought . She was at least an inch or two over five feet . " Yes , indeed , " she said ; " but you do n't know the half of it , Mary , not the quarter , nor the eighth . I 'm leaving my public . " " You 're what ? " " Leaving them flat  --  like that . " She spread her little hands , palms downward . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ just had to see your face . " " Well , let 's all sit down , " Mary said . " A shock 's coming . We 'd better be set for it . " She and Tommy returned to their chairs ; Hollis sat on the edge of the couch and looked up at Mary . She began to speak , hesitated , and turned to Tommy . " My public , " she explained to him , " is in Woolworth 's . I sit and play sheet music all day . You know . " He smiled . " Well , you can be sure of having a public , anyway . " " You have no idea ! Well , today I came back from lunch and nobody was around . Sometimes that happens . For hours there will be a crowd , and then everybody disappears  --  from the music counter , I mean . Have I set the stage ? " " You have n't , " Mary replied , " but we 'll take the stage for granted . Lift the curtain . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ left I 'm sitting just strumming ,  | you know , and then I began to play some of Schumann 's Carnaval . ' Dear me , I 've mixed up my tenses . Well , let ' em go . . . I forgot a passage and so I switched to Debussy . I 'd forgotten all about my job , and I was having a perfectly lovely time all by myself . " " You 're really a trained musician , then ? " Tommy asked . " No  --  not really . I studied the violin and piano for years , but most of the time I had second-rate teachers . That 's all I deserved , because I 've got only a second- or third-rate talent . The fiddle 's really my instrument . I majored in music at Vassar , and I did n't aspire to anything more than a high school job , but you can imagine the chance I had of getting one two years ago . " Tommy nodded . " Yes , I can imagine . Several men I know took a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ n't find jobs . " " That 's what I wanted to do , but I could n't scrape up the money for the tuition . I was so anxious to get a job that I did n't apply for a scholarship until it was too late . Luckily , I can play jazz . " " But , Hollis , " Mary objected , " do n't get historical . Forget the past now . What 's the big news ? " " Well , where was I ? Oh , yes , playing Debussy . . . Oh , Mary , it was perfect  --  a real Cinderella story . Somebody spoke , and what do you suppose he said ? In Woolworth 's ! He said , I beg your pardon , but can you play any Scriabine ? ' In Woolworth 's ! I just stared at him for a minute and then I asked him what he wanted me to play . He said he just wanted to know . Then he began to talk about music and asked me a lot of questions . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a mustache . He told me later he 'd come in to buy a pencil . On such things do the fate of nations depend . Do n't glare at me , Mary . I wo n't keep you in suspense much longer . " He turned out to be the manager of Sturmen 's Fifth Avenue store  --  the music publishers , you know . And they needed a salesman , somebody who knew about music . Most  | of their customers are real musicians , you know , and he offered me the job on the spot . Double the money , Mary ! " Too happy to remember the stranger in the room , she jumped up and began to dance , singing , " Double the money ! Double the money ! " Mary clapped her hands , cried , " Hurrah for you ! " Then she leaped to her feet , caught Hollis 's flying hands , pumped them up and down . " It 's grand ! It 's wonderful ! " She and Hollis smiled happily at each other . Mary laughed , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are here again . " She could sing magnificently . Her big contralto filled the studio , made it ring . Hollis joined in with her little high soprano . Tommy had felt uncomfortable , an intruder . He had no place in this happiness , but it was so complete , so free , that it caught him up . Though still a little self-conscious , he began to sing . Mary smiled her approval , disengaged a hand from Hollis 's and held it out to him . Laughing , he shook his head . He 'd feel like a fool . Mary wrinkled her nose at him , took Hollis 's hand again , and whirled her around the studio while the three of them sang at the top of their lungs . " Hey , " cried Mary , turning to Tommy when they had finished the chorus , " you 've got a good voice . " " You 've got a wonderful voice ! " he retorted . " Fiddlesticks ! " " Wo n't somebody please say , " Hollis pleaded , panting , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Small but true ; something like that , you know ? " " You sing like a good fiddler , " said Mary . " I feel like music . I want to sing . If I only had a piano . " " I 've got one , " Tommy said . " Can you play it ? " " Yes . " " Let 's go up to your place , then , and sing . " She looked at him , her great dark eyes shining . " Ca n't we ? "  | " Ca n't we ? Of course we can . That 's what I meant . But we need a tenor . Who 's a tenor ? " Tenor , tenor , " chanted Mary . " Who 's got a tenor ? " " I know ! " cried Tommy . " Steve Austin ! Come on . We 'll pick him up on the way . " Something had died in him and something had been born . He had n't felt like this in years . Some confining reticence had been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ felt free and glad and eager . Sing ? That 's what he wanted to do  --  sing and sing and sing . And laugh . For no reason he was laughing as he helped the girls into their coats , laughing as he jerked on his own , laughing as they ran down the stairs . He hailed a taxi , gave the driver Austin 's address , and dropped into the seat between Hollis and Mary . Hollis bent forward and studied the picture of the driver that the law requires to be placed in every New York City taxicab . " His name 's Aaron Pogor-nor-sel-ski , " she whispered , " and he looks dangerous . " " They always do , " said Mary . " Happy days are here again , " she hummed . " Happy days are here again , " hummed Tommy . Mary hummed . Hollis hummed . Aaron Pogornorselski swung his cab through the Square and lifted his voice , loud and clear . " Happy days are here again , " he sang . " He 's a tenor @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Hey , driver ! " Tommy shouted . " Hold on a minute ! Altogether now ! " Through the arch sped the taxi , into Fifth Avenue . A pedestrian stopped , listened . " That , " he said to himself , " is a pretty damned good quartet . " Three hours later Tommy lay in bed , his head cradled in the palms of his hands , his eyes wide open in the darkness .  | His body relaxed gratefully , but his mind was bubbling with thoughts . What an evening ! Why , he had n't had such a good time since  --  since . . . Since Freda ? No ; they 'd never had times like that . Lots of good times , yes  --  but different , quieter , more , more . . . What was the word ? Careful ? Yes , that was it . They 'd always been careful . He did n't let go easily , and Freda had always been afraid . He had n't known that then , but he did now . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd bet they did . Well , the more power to them . Freda had earned the right to laugh . . . There 'd been good times with Polly , too , but not like this . Tonight  --  why , tonight he 'd felt really young , young the way he had in college . It 'd been a real song fest , a real letting-go . And how old Steve had loosened up ! " I 'll bet , " he thought , " he has n't let go like that for five years . It must 've done him a world of good . " Clearly in the darkness he saw Steve 's amazement when he had rushed into the dingy little hall bedroom . Remembering , he chuckled . " Come on , Steve , " he had cried . " We need a tenor . " Steve had turned from his writing and frowned . " Tenor ? Listen , Gray , I 'm experiencing a moment in literature . There 's a bandit at the bottom of a canyon with the sheriff and his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them there . The suspense will kill them . Besides , I need the money . " But Tommy had been too exhilarated for argument . He would listen to no No 's . They needed a tenor . Steve had to come . When had they begun using first names ? Tommy could n't remember . Sometime or other the Misses and Misters had disappeared , and it was Steve and Tommy and Mary and Hollis . Of course , they 'd called Steve Caruso because his voice broke into a thin falsetto whenever he had to sing higher than F sharp . What was it Steve called Mary ? Oh , yes , Brunnehilde . . . Then for half an hour Steve had been  | Siegfried . They 'd acted like a lot of crazy kids , but it was a hell of a lot of fun . Glorious voice Mary had . Beside her , Hollis looked like a robin and sounded like a linnet . She could play the piano , though . She had sat with him on the bench and the two of them @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He wished some of the highbrow critics could have seen the author of Sere and Yellow strutting his stuff . He 'd forgotten what fun Steve could be . Why , he remembered back in Hanover  --  where was it , anyway ? Oh , yes , that blond fellow 's room in Hitchcock . Steve had put on a show all by himself . He 'd had a drink or two and let go . The show had had a name and everything . " The Bride 's Dilemma or Should I ' Fell ? " That was it . . . Tommy smiled at the memory . They had rolled on the floor laughing . Steve and Hollis certainly got together in a hurry . You 'd think they 'd known each other for years . . . Steve had a girl somewhere , though , did n't he ? Or did he ? One never knew about Steve . He talked a lot , but he did n't tell anything . Maybe he had a dozen girls and maybe he 'd never had one . It did @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Hollis had a kind of wistful charm . She was n't thrilling like Mary , but she knew music , and  --  well , he did n't know , but he liked her . Sometime during the evening he had learned her story . She came from Iowa , and her father was a mathematics teacher in a country high school . He had gone to the State university , but his sister had gone to Vassar and he had been determined that Hollis should go there , too . Then the depression had hit them . " It was actually cheaper for me to stay in college , " Hollis said , " than go home . I had a scholarship and I managed to get a job . I could just about pay my own way . Dad 's salary was cut and cut and cut , and he had to take care of his mother and sister . Grandma owned a farm . It was leased , you know , and she and Aunt Edith lived on the rent . You can imagine  | what happened @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was n't anything any one could do ; they had to come live with Dad and Mother . And there we were . When I graduated there was n't any sense in going back to Iowa . There was n't any sense in going anywhere . I came to New York because it was near and because I knew a couple of girls I could stay with . " She laughed . " It was really awfully funny  --  anyway , it seems funny now . They had two rooms in a basement in the Village . We did n't like each other at all after a month . We just could n't abide each other , but there never was a mean word spoken . We did n't dare say boo . You see , one of us always had a job , but only one . There was n't a single week when two of us had jobs at the same time . Just as sure as I got something , a bank would close and Ethel 's boss would close down  --  or if Ethel got a job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to each other and so we were perfect little ladies every single minute . " Then a few months ago we discovered that we all had jobs at once . You ought to have seen the fur fly . Maybe it was just relief . I do n't know , but all three of us let loose and said all the things we 'd thought and had n't dared to say . We got out of that basement as if it was haunted . Each of us got a room to herself . We 've made up since , of course , and Ethel and Sue are back together again . I had dinner with them tonight . That 's why I was late getting to Mary 's  --  but I 'm glad I 'm alone . " She had a little room , it seemed , in a run-down brownstone house far uptown on the edge of Harlem . The room was dark and the neighborhood a little frightening , but for the present she was satisfied . She had talked a lot about Mary , Tommy remembered . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , she was right at that . There was something magnificent about Mary , something grand and noble  --  and it was n't just because she was big , either . She ought n't to be  | living alone , not a woman like her . She ought to be mothering sons , big , lusty fellows . . . She 'd make a wonderful mother  --  a wonderful wife , too . . . She 'd give everything when she gave , her body , her heart , everything . . . . Drowsiness dimmed his mind . " I 'll have to get them together again soon , " he promised himself , rousing a little to catch at the wisp of thought before sinking into slumber . " It was grand . . . grand evening . . . . "  | THE next morning he promised himself again that he would collect the same group for another evening soon , but New York defeated his intention . That day he sent Mary a copy of Sere and Yellow and wrote on the fly-leaf , " To commemorate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ received from her a note of gratitude . Twice in December he tried to call her by telephone , but received no answer . He and Steve went to Westchester for dinner with Tucker and assured each other that the quartet must sing soon again and often thereafter . But Steve 's shabby rooming-house boasted no telephone ; and without Mary , Tommy had no way of getting in touch with Hollis . He had taken her home that evening , but he had made no note of her address . Besides , she had said something about moving as soon as she began work at her new job . New York , he reflected irritably , scattered people like a high wind . Outside of his clubs , he rarely saw by accident any one he knew . One always had to telephone or write to make an engagement , and usually chance meetings provided the best times . But there was Mary away down in the Village ; he was in the middle of Manhattan far over on the East Side ; Hollis was clear out to hell and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . A group was hardly formed before the city smashed it . Down in the Village , of course , certain groups ate in certain restaurants regularly , just as uptown certain groups drank regularly in certain fashionable bars ; but the restaurants , after all , were really the Villagers ' clubs , During the day those groups were as widely dispersed , he  | imagined , as he and his friends were . Perhaps they did meet more casually than uptown people did , wander in and out of each other 's rooms and apartments more generally ; but if the Village did succeed in imitating community life , it did it by intention , not by normal accident , and it did it by resisting the intrusion of thousands upon thousands of Italians who were outside the community . Besides , what was the use of thinking of Greenwich Village ? It was the last place in the world that he wanted to live . Even in Boston , he knew , there was no such dispersion as there was in New York . In his Harvard ( @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Common or on Tremont Street . If he went tea dancing at the Copley Plaza , he saw people he knew ; and if he went down to DirganPark 's for a steak and cornbread , he almost certainly saw people he knew , too . Boston spread far and wide , but it had a center , the core of a community . So had Paris . And so had London . Of course , in Los Angeles one expected to motor thirty miles to see anybody , but who wanted to live in I.os Angeles ? He smiled at his own irritation and confessed that about a million people seemed to find Los Angeles endurable , but he certainly was n't one of them . No , New York was sui generis , bigger , richer , harder , more complex , more conglomerate than any other city in the world . London for all its Sohos , Cheapsides , and Limehouses was English  --  but New York ? What was it ? It . was everything ; it was the world pressed , twisted , squeezed into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ had ever succeeded in getting it between covers . It was impossible for a writer to fix attention on more than one of its thousands of groups at a time , and the thousands of groups were always operating , touching , separating , conflicting . They broke up , blended , assembled into new groups . New York was a prism in motion , its colors ever changing . How could a writer describe it ? One might as well try to describe a scrambled spectrum .  | Time and again Tommy had found himself part of a group only to discover in a few months that the group had disappeared . Some of his friends lived in Manhattan ; two or three on Long Island , a good many in various Westchester towns , and still others in New Jersey . His bachelor friends seemed to be contented enough in Manhattan so long as they were bachelors ; but if marriage did not drive them to the suburbs , the first baby always did . Then they were seldom in the clubs , except perhaps for lunch . Greetings @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to talk about . " Why do n't you come out to see us , Tommy ? We want you , you know , old man , and it is n't a bad trip  --  only forty-five minutes by train , and we 'll meet you . " Tommy always promised to come , always meant to ; but the invitations were seldom for a definite date , and one does not travel forty-five minutes or more on impulse to make a call . And so , though the intention was firmly fixed , Tommy did not succeed in getting his quartet together again for a long time . Christmas and its festivities arrived . Because he was always afraid of loneliness during the Christmas season , he accepted enough invitations to keep him almost sternly occupied . Wealthy friends invited him for Christmas Day to their Long Island estate . There was a large crowd , much liquor , wild gaiety . For no reason that he could understand , he was achingly lonely . The January weather did its worst . Blizzard succeeded blizzard . The gutters were piled @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Horses slipped and fell and lay waiting with fatalistic patience to be hauled upright . They tried when they were told to try , and slipped despairingly prone again . Taxis slued wildly and their drivers cursed . The wind shrieked through the canyons that New York called streets , making eyes water and faces ache . Beggars moaned piteously , and only the most tender-hearted could bring themselves to pause long enough to find a coin . Like ants fleeing the stream from a garden hose , Manhattan dwellers fled into the manmade  | anthills they called home . Tommy did likewise . His particular cell seemed very empty , isolated from all other cells , utterly alone . II Tommy went to the Longstruthers ' dance because he was lonely and blue . His acquaintance with Charles Longstruther and his third wife was of the slightest , and he had no idea why he had been invited . Probably , he decided , because the stag line had n't promised to be long enough . Charles and Marcia Longstruther belonged to the group that kept the gossip columnists in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or Colony for lunch , " No. 21 " at live o'clock for cocktails , some other bar or fashionable restaurant for dinner , a first night , and the night club of the moment . Members of that group seemed always to be " Renovating , " " merging , " or " phffting . " And once in great while a couple surprised themselves and all their acquaintances by " blessedeventing . " The men were perfectly tailored , barbered , manicured , and massaged ; the women were so completely the products of couturiers , modistes , and Charles of this or Emile of that , that they hardly seemed real . Most of them drank incredible quantities of cocktails , and they gossiped about each other 's doings and misdoings with all the gusto and malice of the Ladies ' Aid Society of Little Four Corners . Tommy knew well enough what the dance would be like ? a combination made at tremendous expense of a country picnic , a taxi dance-hall , and a vaudeville show . Instead of deviled eggs and lemon pop , there @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tickets to dance there would be only one ; and instead of vaudeville acts performed in a setting where they were most effective , there would be vaudeville acts performed in a setting where they would be most ineffective . People would smoke too much , drink too much , and scream too much . Oh well , he told himself , what the  | hell ? He might have a halfway good time . Anyway , it would be better than sitting in his apartment slumping down into stupid and entirely unreasonable blues . The music and champagne proved good , and by one o'clock he found himself dancing with a good deal more verve and pleasure than he had hoped for . Nevertheless , he planned to slip away soon . He had had just about enough . Then Kay Stilton beckoned to him from over her partner 's shoulder , and he obligingly cut in . He had met her half a dozen times in the past few years , but he knew her best by reputation . Less than thirty , she was supposed to have attained @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ younger women in her group . There were always rumors that she was going to Hollywood , that she was going to Reno , that she was going to write a book . As a matter of fact , a year before she had gone to Reno and divorced her wealthy husband . Tommy had not seen her or heard of her since . He said something of the sort and she explained , " I 've been back only a couple of weeks . I spent six months in Hollywood , you know , three more in Mexico , and the rest of the time abroad . You 're looking bonny . How 's that ? I was in Edinburgh three days . " Tommy leaned back a little to smile at her . " That 's remarkable . Do you speak Spanish , too ? " " No nice words . Let 's dance in no language . " No language ? Tommy smiled to himself . Her body was speaking a language no man could fail to understand . It was a language that asked questions , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a pause in the music . She looked up at him , smiled almost wearily , and asked in a soft , drowsy voice , " You collect etchings , do n't you ? " " Yes  --  and I show them , too . " " I 'm crazy about etchings . " " Shall we go look at them ? " " Pretty please . "  | Tommy watched Kay Stilton make up her lips in his dresser mirror . She was very careful , very exact . It was fascinating to see how deftly she restored to herself her glazed perfection . The curls had already been attended to , the mascara on her lashes , the rouge on her cheeks . Now she was applying the finishing touches , and apparently she had forgotten he existed . She looked at him in the mirror and surprised him by asking his image , " You do n't want to go hack , do you ? " " Oh , no , " he said , " but I 'll see you home . " " Home ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The party 's good for hours yet . But there 's no need for you to go with me . As a matter of fact , I 'd rather you would n't . Just call a taxi , that 's all . " " But did n't you say just a few minutes ago , " Tommy asked , " that you were fed up with the party ? " " I am , but I 'm going back , just the same . It 's sad to leave you , but I must . " " It is sad , but there 'll be another time , I hope . " " Another time ? " She looked at him and smiled . " Oh , no . I never try to improve on a pleasant memory . Now I must be going . My husband will be waiting . " " Your husband ? " " But yes , my husband . I always like to go home with him . " The worst of it was , Tommy thought later , she knew perfectly how completely she had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ got some kind oI ' perverted satisfaction out of her knowledge . Apparently she had been married again somewhere , and undoubtedly she would be divorced again sometime . What did it matter ? All that mattered was that she had left him with a foul taste in his mouth . She had given him satisfaction , taken satisfaction from him , and then deliberately , coldly , maliciously robbed him of his . Once more his senses had deceived him into all hour of passion . With almost painful sureness he knew there would be a week of regret .  | " I 'll be a fool , " he told himself severely , " if I let myself get low on account of this . I did n't know she had a husband , and I did n't know what she was like . There 's no sense in trying to fool myself into thinking I can go without women all the time . I know damn well I ca n't . She was willing . Besides , she started it ; I did n't . And what difference @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'd known . . . His thought trailed off . He was n't getting anywhere . Somehow one could n't argue away disgust ; one could n't analyze regret out of existence . And it was always like this . There was always something to make him wish he had n't , something that made the memory ugly . If it had been some other girl , it would have been something else . There was always something grimy about taking a girl you did n't care anything about . Some men would rather have it that way . . . . Off with the old ; on with the new . . . . Not him . No ; no , he was n't made that way . How many times he 'd tried to be , and how many times he 'd failed ! And when he reasoned about it , he reasoned like a sixteen-yearold boy . At his age there should be no need to reason . But at his age a man who 'd been married could n't turn into a monk , either . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " or society is . I 've got to have a wife , and there is n't a woman on God 's green earth I 'd dare to marry . Besides , there is n't any woman I want to marry . " He prepared to go to bed . " What 's the difference ? Tomorrow I 'll be going through the motions of living again , and by day after tomorrow maybe half the time I 'll think I really am . " Early in February Nicholas Tyckman was again in Tommy 's office . After long discussion another troublesome detail of the aunt 's estate was taken care of , and they leaned back in their chairs . " You know , " said Tyckman , " I have n't been in the Yale  | Club since that day I was there with you  --  not until yesterday , that is . I saw young Carter again , and that reminded me of what you said about his sister . I was interested . I thought his attitude was very odd  --  or , rather , he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know how to put . it  --  a little unsure ? Something like that , anyway . Certainly not natural . " " Well , " said Tommy , " I do n't know . " He reflected that Bill Carter 's relations with his sister were none of Tyckman 's business  --  or of his , for that matter . " I do n't know Carter . You heard everything I ever said to him . I 've called on Mary Carter , though , and I admire her enormously . She 's an artist , as I think I told you . A good one , too , if I 'm any judge . I do n't know whether she exhibits or not . I doubt it , though ; she does n't think well enough of her work . " " How does she sell it , then ? " " Oh , she earns her living as a commercial artist , and I 'm sure she does very well . I suspect she feeds about half the down-and-outers in the Village ; and I suspect , too @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to . I saw her feed one myself that I half wanted to put my foot on . In her way she 's as stunning as Bill Carter , and she has a beautiful contralto voice . Brains , too . I assure you Mary Carter 's worth knowing . " " Sounds like it . I 'm interested in art , you know , and I 'd like to know her if she 's really good . But did n't her brother say she would n't come uptown ? " Tommy smiled . " I told her you 'd introduced me to brother Bill , and she said she 'd give anything to see a picture you own  --  a John Van Eyck , I think it was . " " Oh , so she 's heard about my Van Eyck ! Well , if that 's a lure , let 's use it . " Tommy considered the idea . He did n't know whether he liked it or not . Tyckman was Tyckman , and Mary was Mary ; their worlds were far apart . Tyckman was famous @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ even more famous for standards even more rigid ; Mary fed Verne Ticknors and  | his like . Tommy did n't care how much Mary might shock Tyckman , but he had no intention of putting Mary in a position where Tyckman might snub her . He was too tired to think up a tactful evasion . So he said frankly : " To be quite honest , Mr. Tyckman , I doubt if you and Miss Carter would get along . I 'm not implying criticism of you , but she 's a Villager and ? " " I 'm a snob , " Tyckman broke in . Tommy was so startled by having the thought spoken that he had had no intention of speaking , that he could only gasp and hunt for a denial . Tyckman smiled at his confusion . " Listen , Gray , " he said ; " I know exactly what you 've heard about me and what you 're thinking . I presume I 'm a snob , but definitions differ . Consider my position . I was born where I am . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you 're intelligent enough to recognize that my position brings certain penalties with it . People want to know me  --  not because I 'm me , mind you , but because I can do something for them socially . Maybe they 're nice people otherwise , but I do n't get a chance to see their nice side . I see them only when they 're sucking up to me . " That 's been going on since I was a kid . When I was younger , I let myself be used a few times  --  and then found out that I 'd been used . I did n't like it . I made up my mind it would n't happen again , and it has n't  --  not to my knowledge , anyway . Probably I 've cut some people I 'd like to know . I ca n't help that . I had to escape hundreds I did n't want to know . I 've liked working with you because I soon saw you did n't give one small-sized damn about knowing me . " " That @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ All right . I 'm glad to hear it . But you did n't give a damn about my being Nicholas Tyckman . " " That 's true . It would be all the same to me if you were Nicholas Murphy or Nicholas Ginsberg . " He grinned impishly.  | " I 'm not prejudiced  --  not even against the aristocracy . " Tyckman threw back his big head and roared . " That 's good , " he gasped . " That 's damned good . I must tell Mother . She 'll love it . " " Your mother ? " Tommy asked , astounded . " Certainly . You think she 'd be offended ? Not Mother . She may be a Bourbon , but she 's a realist , too . She respects a good poke in the nose . If you 'd been toadied to as much as she has , you would , too . " He paused , gazed thoughtfully at the window , and then went on , his voice heavy and serious : " No , Gray , I 'm not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Circumstances force me to stick pretty much to my own crowd , but I go out of it when I get a free chance . Now , quit being a careful lawyer for a minute and tell me honestly why you do n't think Miss Carter and I will get along . " " Very well , " said Tommy , " I 'll tell you exactly what I think . You 've got to understand first that Mary Carter is a very big woman  --  almost as tall as I am . She 's magnificently built and carries her height perfectly . I do n't pretend to understand her , but I have a hunch she 's sensitive about her size . Anyway , when I first met her she seemed to go out of her way to be blunt and mannish . Maybe I 'm wrong , but I 'll bet she always does that with strangers . And she uses any language she wants to . " Tyckman 's blond eyebrows went up and he smiled broadly . " You think she 'll shock me ? " He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ meet as many debutantes as you do . Now , honestly , Gray , do you think any Village artist could even startle me ? I 'll stack my youngest niece 's language against the most eloquent truck driver in town . " Tommy threw up his hands . " You really want to meet Mary Carter , do n't you ? " " I do . Maybe it 's because you said she looked like Dolores , and I was mad about her . Maybe it 's because she 's an artist , and painting is my greatest interest . Maybe . . . But I think  | it 's mainly the way Bill Carter acted . I 'm not subtle . My worst enemy would n't call me that , but once in a while I try to think  --  and he made me think . If she 's what you say she is , I ca n't understand him . I do n't know him well , but I 've always liked him a good deal . Just the same , if I do understand him and if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ought to have his tail kicked . " " Well , maybe , " said Tommy , " but I do n't know enough to judge . Would you like me to take you to call on Miss Carter ? " " I 'd be grateful if you would . Or maybe she 'd like it better if we used the Van Eyck as an excuse for you to bring her to my place . I think from what you say that she 'd like it best if you just put it up to her . " " I think so too . If I can get in touch with her , I 'll let you know tomorrow . " " Fine . And remember , please , that I 'm not trying to escape a call . In a way , I 'd prefer it because I 'd like to see her work . But do n't consider my wishes . Whatever Miss Carter wants will be entirely satisfactory to me . " Tommy telephoned to Mary that evening and found himself unexpectedly moved by the sound of her rich @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " he said , " but got no answer . I wanted to get our quartet together again . " " Oh , I 'm sorry ; that was such a grand evening . I slipped out of town a couple of times for a day or two to paint some clean snow . You must have called me then . " " Probably . Tell me , do you still want to see Nicholas Tyckman 's Van Eyck ? " " Do I ! They say it 's a treasure . " " Well , I can manage it . " " You can ! " " Yes . You see , Tyckman is often in my office . I told him  | about your painting , and I said you were anxious to see his Van Eyck . He seemed delighted and said to bring you along . He said he 'd like to call and see your work , but I knew how you felt about showing it to strangers ; so he said to arrange it anyway you liked best . " " Well , if that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ collector , but I did n't think he 'd speak socially to any one less than Marin . " " That 's what I thought , but he really is n't like his reputation . I think you 'll like him . I do . Would you rather he 'd call ? " " No-o-o ; no , I do n't think so . That would make it social , would n't it ? And we wo n't want to know each other . Ca n't I just rush in and look at his pictures and rush out again ? " Tommy chuckled . " I do n't know how many butlers will be in the way , but I 'll be glad to run interference for you . How about tomorrow or the day after ? " " Fix it to suit Mr. Tyckman . I can always drop my brushes and go . " When Tommy suggested to Tyckman that he bring Mary the next afternoon , Tyckman was immediately agreeable . " How about a little after five ? " he asked . " I have a dinner @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seven-thirty . " " I 'm sure that will be fine . " Mary was ready and waiting when Tommy called for her . He stared without shame . She was wearing a black dress made of very light-weight wool . The collar , belt , and sleeves were heavily embroidered in coarse woolen thread , red , green , yellow , and blue . Her felt hat was black , too , with a red buckle placed in exactly the right spot . " I 'm not one to comment on women 's clothes , " he said , " but yours are so stunning that I ca n't help it . They suit you perfectly . You must have a wonderful dressmaker . " Her color deepened and her dark eyes shone . " I have , " she acknowledged , smiling . " The woman is an artist . " " She is . You 're right . "
