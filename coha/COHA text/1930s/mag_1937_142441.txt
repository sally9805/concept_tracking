THE LETTERS OF LENIN-Translated &; edited by Elizabeth Hill &; Doris Mudie- Harcourt , Brace ( $4 ) . <P> Of the thousands of letters written by Vladimir Ilich Ulianov in his 54-year life , about 1,000 are left . That is not because his correspondents were thoughtless but because Vladimir Ulianov was a revolutionary . Many a missive he wrote in invisible ink , bound inside book covers , traced between lines of bromidic gossip ; many were destroyed when read , some were intercepted , some went to the dead letter orifice . In Russia , where Vladimir Ulianov 's tomb is Moscow 's most sacred sight , three volumes of his letters have been published . Last week U. S. readers were glad to be able to see for themselves what kind of letters were written by the No. 1 Revolutionary of the 20th Century , were also glad that Editors Hill &; Mudie 's ample selection did not include any more . <P> For nonrevolutionary readers , Lenin 's letters are likely to be disappointingly unexplosive . Such readers may not even agree at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ there emerges above all the vivid figure of Lenin himself . " Lenin 's letters are like business letters . But it was a big business he was about , and as his scheme slowly progresses from small successes to failure to near-success to triumph , even businessmen readers will scarce forbear to cheer . Irritation , anger when schemes go wrong or partners fail him , Lenin frequently shows ; personal feeling , almost never . The letters to his wife , Krupskaya , and references to her before and after marriage , are as impersonally businesslike as all the others . Only in his letters to his mother does he show a personal face : to her he is unfailingly tender . <P> Lenin 's letters begin in 1895 , when he was a 25-year-old lawyer and already a fledgling revolutionary . Little less than a year later he writes from a Petersburg prison , awaiting his long journey to three years in Siberia . Krupskaya , arrested later , was allowed to join him there . They were married , but when Lenin 's term was up she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ letter to her after their separation is a lengthy dissertation on intraParty politics . When Krupskaya was released she joined Lenin 's exile in Europe , and for the next 16 years they led a lonely , hand-to-mouth life , supporting themselves by translations , lectures , literary work , trying to patch together a working revolutionary organization . Once , in a letter to his mother , Lenin allowed his discouragement to appear : " My life goes on as usual and fairly lonely . . . and unfortunately pretty senseless . "
