Elbert Hubbard , flowing-haired , flowing-tied purveyor of philosophical-artistic tripe to the U. S. of a generation ago , was drowned when the Lusitania was sunk . To his son , Elbert II , he left a lucrative property-the Roycrofter Corporation in East Aurora , N. Y. Inspired by William Morris , 19th-Century British arts- &-crafter,; the Roycrofters printed and bound books , made elegant whatnots of pottery , wood , metal and hand-tooled leather . After the elder Hubbard 's death , however , the community slipped financially , lately was $160,000 in the red . Last week , a religious organization called the Federation of Churches of Infinite Science , Inc. contracted to buy the Roycroft properties for $121,500 and take over most of the community 's debts . <P> Nonsectarian , incorporated in 1935 , the Federation construes the word " churches " broadly , to mean a group of people with a common aim . The Federation 's aim , shared by 20,000 people in the U. S. , is to apply the principles of the Sermon on the Mount " scientifically " to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ field , how they grow , and it accepts Christ 's words : Let your light so shine before men , that they may see your good works . To grow like the lily or to shine like the light is to use the " creative essence of the power of God , " which everyone possesses . Not everyone , however , has an equal chance to create . So the Federation , by means of a revolving sinking fund to which each of its members lends $25 , attempts to equalize matters by training , and finding jobs for , people " of good moral character , free from religious prejudice . " <P> President of the Federation is Clarence B. Benedict , a retired patent attorney of Brookline , Mass. , who will be president of the new Roycroft Community . The jobs which Infinite Science is to provide in East Aurora will be much the same as those of the old Roycrofters , but more numerous - up to 1,000 when the shops are running at Infinite capacity with three scientific shifts .     @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
