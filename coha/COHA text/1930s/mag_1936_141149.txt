Nicaragua 's regularly elected President Juan Bautista Sacasa last week ruled only the top of the dead volcano on which stands the Presidential Palace at Managua . In complete control of the rest of Nicaragua was the National Guard , created and trained by U. S. Marines during the seven-year U. S. occupation , and its General Anastasio Somoza , who had deployed his men around the base of the volcano . No murmur of protest at these activities rose from the Nicaraguan populace , who chose to regard the affair strictly as a quarrel between Somoza and Sacasa for the right to name Nicaragua 's next President . <P> Even so , not a few Nicaraguans were worried lest this private political fight serve as an excuse for another term of U. S. occupation . Accordingly , a Somoza spokesman last week broadcast the plea : " Let us solve our own problems . Let us shed our own blood . " U. S. Secretary of State Cordell Hull replied , to pointed inquiries from Chile and Peru , that the U. S. had no intention of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's puny ( $13,000,000 ) investments . <P> After six days on the volcano , President Sacasa announced : " You may say for me that I was not the man for the situation because of my horror of violence and bloodshed . They may accuse me of weakness but never of unworthiness . It would be undignified to continue as President . " Then he and his brother . Supreme Court Justice Federico , descended into the capital , entrained for the coast and exile in Salvador . Gloated General Somoza : " This has been a bloodless revolution and there are no hard feelings . " The General spoke broadly . Sixteen were killed .
