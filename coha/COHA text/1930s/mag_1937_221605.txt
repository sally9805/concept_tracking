For 1,000 years , the best of man 's best friends have been the dogs of St. Bernard , traditionally trained by the monks of that hospice to succor and save benighted travelers in the 8,111-ft. pass under Mt . Blanc 's cold shoulder near the Franco-Swiss frontier . Weighing up to 200 Ib. in maturity , the St. Bernard dogs are noted for great strength , docility , intelligence , and an expression of almost idiotic benignity . From puppyhood , the dogs are taught to drag unconscious travelers as far as they can , then run &; fetch the monks from the hospice . In times past the clogs actually carried around their necks the pictorially famed little kegs of brandy . Most illustrious of these lifesavers was Barry , who died while trying for his 41st rescue , was memorialized in bronze at the monastery . <P> One fine morning last week , the St. Bernard record for canine Christianity was unaccountably shattered . From Grenoble . Dr. Jean Bremond had set out on a skiing trip across the Swiss border with his three young @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ St. Bernard pass . Cru-u-unch went their skis in the granular Alpine snow as they came in sight of the home of the pious monks of St. Bernard . A deep-voiced barking broke out as the famed dogs of the monastery came leaping to greet the travelers . Shrieking with laughter and excitement , ten-year-old Marie-Anne hurried ahead . <P> What Dr. Bremond saw then from 300 yards away had the deliberate horror of a slow-motion nightmare . The dogs closed in on the little girl . No longer could the doctor see Marie-Anne , but he could hear her shrieking . One of the dogs seemed to be worrying at a large rag doll . With their black gowns hiked up , the monks came stumbling and shouting from their quarters . When the dogs were finally hauled &; called off , Marie-Anne lay limp and bleeding in the snow . <P> Inside the hospice , Marie-Anne shortly died with deep gashes in her face and body . Great was the grief of the brotherhood of St. Bernard , but the monks maintained they could not identify the killer . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " gave as the only possible explanation of the tragedy their belief that the guilty dog must have " suddenly gone mad . " Sorrowed the Father Superior : " We are in deep mourning here , not only for this unfortunate girl , but for the honor of our dogs that has been unblemished for centuries . "
