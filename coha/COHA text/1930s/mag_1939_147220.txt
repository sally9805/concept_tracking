In Florida the law says that a political party must poll at least 15% of votes cast in general elections to keep its place on the ballot at the next election . Two years ago the required figure was 30% , but the Legislature lowered it for the benefit of the Republican Party . Last week Florida 's Legislature acted again , cut the figure to 5% for the vestigial G. O. P.
