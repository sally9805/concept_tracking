( See Cover ) <P> When President Roosevelt signed the Relief deficiency bill last month , he announced with annoyance that he would presently ask again for $150,000,000 which Congress had lopped off it . Last week he asked-but without annoyance . Before publicly putting the heat on Congress he told his press conference that he would ask only for as much as WPAdministrator Harrington found was needed . Three days later-behind closed doors in the White House-he politely asked a House subcommittee headed by Colorado 's Taylor to provide the money . Not often before has Franklin Roosevelt said " Pretty please " to Congress . <P> The manner of his doing it was a small thing . No small thing , however , were the circumstances that dictated the manner . The President was treading cautiously because Government economy and the " appeasement " of business ( see p. 11 ) , including the repeal of burdensome taxes , had become serious issues within his own party , even within his own Administration . Democrats who could not be ignored had taken a stand that could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was that supposedly greatest of nonentities , a Vice President of the U.

( The Republican Party found its left wing rebellious in the Coolidge-Hoover era . ) Rebellion by the substantial leaders of a party against their leader-in-chief is rarer . And the rebellion which John Nance Garner now leads is rarer still in that it is , save in small things , almost intangible-less a rebellion than a resistance . It is nonetheless the biggest political struggle now going on in Washington . <P> This split between the President and his Vice President really dates from the winter of 1937 when John Garner bluntly berated Franklin Roosevelt for doing nothing about the Sit-Down strikes . Subsequently he made his famed remark ( perhaps apocryphal , but truer than history ) : " You 've got to give the cattle Business a chance to put some fat on their bones .

After the funeral at Little Rock , Ark. , John Garner went straight to Franklin Roosevelt , plainly told him his Court plan was beaten , but he still was loyal enough to engineer a compromise that saved some face . <P> December 17 , 1938 was the next big day for the Rebellion-when John Garner returned to Washington after six months in Texas . After two hours with National Chairman Jim Farley , the Vice President spent three and one-half hours with the President , trying to tell him that the November election results were not ( as a famed Janizariat chart purported to prove ) a collection of local overturns , but first evidence of a popular trend to the Right , toward economy . Ray Tucker , oldtime Washington correspondent who enjoys Mr. Garner 's confidence more than most men , reported that in this session the Vice President told the President to " decide whether you 're gon na get on or get off , " and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the baby or let it go !
