txt Prohibition Has Benefited Some . To the Editor of The New York Times : I read a column in THE Timgs captioned " Find No One Saved by Prohibition Act . " Advertised on the sides of the bus containing the men engaged in this worthy enterprise was printed " A nation-wide search for the beneficiaries of the $24,000,000,000 experiment . " Every one who is in touch with current events surely must know that prohibition has benefited a vast number of people . What about Al Capone ? Thousands of beer and rum runners , numerous speakeasy proprietors , not to mention other types of gangsters , gunmen and politicians . Has not prohibition aided them materially ? It is very evident that this research is conducted for a good cause and is very worth while ! Why not , however , leave it to the ballot ? I am more than certain that those whom this noble experiment of a $24,000,000,000 expenditure has not benefited will not be in favor of its continuance and will vote accordingly . WINSLO .
