Seventy-five years ago this July , Georgia readers read with apoplectic rage a new book called A Residence on a Georgian Plantation , the devastating abolitionist journal of Fanny Kemble , famous English actress who abandoned the stage on her U. S. tour to marry a wealthy Georgia plantation owner named Pierce Butler . No Southern writer has ever said a good word for Fanny Kemble . But last week , in Davison-Paxon 's book department in Atlanta , Ga. , Margaret Armstrong 's Fanny Kemble , a sympathetic and excellent biography of this colorful Victorian , outsold all other titles . Elsewhere it crowded the leading non-fiction best-seller The Importance of Living , and with other serious books selling widely , contradicted the theory that summer readers go in for only light fiction . That they buy fewer books , however , was clearly indicated by U. S. booksellers ' figures , which showed a drop of as much as 50% in some Southern bookshops . <P> Although Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings ' The Yearling continued to hold top place , at month 's end it was losing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! , seemed sure to be supplanted . Crowding both was Nordhoff &; Hall 's The Dark River , called by booksellers a " one-month " bestseller . Possibly Kenneth Roberts ' Trending Into Maine should be considered in the same category . At any rate . success in Pittsburgh and Boston made Author Roberts the only U. S. author of the year to have two books on best-seller lists . <P> As reported by leading booksellers throughout the country , July 's best-sellers were , in order of sales : THE YEARLING-Marjorie Kinnan Rawlings-Scribner ( $2.50 ) . <P> MY SON , MY SON ! - Howard Spring- Viking ( $2.50 ) . <P> THE IMPORTANCE OF LIVING-Lin Yu-tang-Reynal &; Hitchcock ( $3 ) . <P> THE DARK RIVER-Charles Nordhoff &; James Norman Hall - Little , Brown ( $2.50 ) . <P> FANNY KEMBLE-Margaret Armstrong - Macmillan ( $3 ) . <P> TRENDING INTO MAINE-Kenneth Roberts-Little , Brown ( $4 ) . <P> THE CITADEL-A .
