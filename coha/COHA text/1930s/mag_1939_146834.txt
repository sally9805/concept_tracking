On the flagpole of Baltimore 's Fort McHenry , men in War of 1812 uniforms raised an American flag with 15 stars . Breasting slowly up the Patapsco River came a Coast Guard picket boat , opened fire with its single small forward gun as cannon from the fort returned rounds of blanks . At battle 's end the flag on the fort still waved proudly . Thus re-enacted last week on its 125th anniversary was the episode which inspired Lawyer Francis Scott Key to write The Star-Spangled Banner . <P> Not wholly pleased by the proceedings was Lawyer Key 's lean and leathery great-grandson , Lieut . Colonel Francis Scott Key-Smith , who hyphenates his name " because there are so darn many Smiths . " Pleased was he that a painting of his ancestor , peering through dawn 's early light , was unveiled in Fort McHenry by Mrs. Reuben Ross Holloway , the tireless patriot who in 1931 helped make The Star-Spangled Banner the official as well as the actual national anthem . But so ill-pleased was he by the political overtones of an address @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ off the platform , went home before the celebrations were over . <P> Lawyer Key hated the War of 1812 ; shortly before he wrote his song was tempted to wish the eagle-screaming Baltimoreans would indeed be conquered . Descendant Key-Smith firmly believes that anyone can sing his ancestor 's anthem . Last July , when Metropolitan Tenor Frederick Jagel said no singer could be at home on a range like that , Lieut . Colonel Key-Smith snorted : " Any real tenor who says he ca n't sing The Star-Spangled Banner is a fool . "
