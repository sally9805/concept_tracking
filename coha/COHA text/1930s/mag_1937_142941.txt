For ten years , four historical bas-reliefs have adorned the pylons of Chicago 's Michigan Avenue Bridge . The Defense ( of Fort Dearborn ) and The Regeneration ( the Chicago fire ) were given the city at a cost of $60,000 by the William Ferguson Fund , and the late William Wrigley Jr . laid out $57,350 for The Pioneers and The Discoverers , the latter plaque representing the landing of Pre Marquette and Explorer La Salle on the site of the present city . Though Michigan Avenue Bridge is one of the most heavily-traveled in the world , few Chicagoans knew until last week that the 15-ft . Marquette bas-relief contains a ridiculous error . The explorer-priest , a Jesuit , is shown in the robes of a Franciscan monk , simply be cause Sculptor James Earl Fraser saw him that way in an old print . <P> Two months ago , memorial services commemorating the 300th birthday of Pre Marquette ( TIME , May 17 ) were held on the Bridge . Present at the event was Dr. Marjorie Marion Nesbit , 33-year-old physician and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a priest whom she did not know , but who casually asked her if she had ever noticed that Marquette 's garb was incorrect . Though no Catholic , Dr. Nesbit was incensed , lost no time in lining up such good Catholics as Judge John Patrick McGoorty , Dennis Francis Kelly of The Fair store and Edward Aloysius Cudahy Jr . of the packing company to raise $200 to have Marquette 's robe altered . Last week Dr. Nesbit 's plans became public when Commissioner of Public Works Oscar Edwin Hewitt approved the project on condition that a competent sculptor could be found to do a historically accurate job at no cost to the city . Fortunately , Pere Marquette 's Franciscan habit can easily be chiseled into resemblance of a Jesuit mantle without even moving the plaque . Sculptor Eugene Romeo will reduce the Franciscan hat to a skullcap , take the fullness out of the robe , remove the monk 's cowl , incise a flat cincture about the waist . <P> Only objector to the project was Vice President James S. Cox of Wrigley 's , who @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that sculpture . It cost a lot of money , and they might ruin it . "
