txt Editorial Correspondence . THE NEW YORK T/EIES . HARTFORD , Dec. 20 . ? Connecticut 's pay-as-you-go policy , one manifestation of which has been the refusal to issue bonds , faces a severe test in the General Assembly convening next month . Governor Cross already has declared he intends to recommend a bond issue to provide $10,000,000 to $12,000,000 for State institutions , and a special commission to study the taxation system in the State is on record with the statement that the accumulating current deficit will amount to between $15,000,000 and $20,000,000 in 1935 and can no longer De called temporary . While even the bond issues proposed bulk large in the eyes of those who have insisted that the State spend no more than it receives in tax revenues , there is no assurance that once a bond issue measure is presented , with some prospects of favorable action , it will not be swelled to three or four times its original size by amendments . The break this week between Governor Cross and the Democratic Senators of the Old Guard faction , constituting @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ weakens the hand of the Governor if he should desire to make any attempt to stop log-rolling in building up the proposed bond issue . Encouraged in Washington . Governor Cross has made one trip to Washington seeking grants from the Federal Government for new institutions if the Legislature will provide some of the money , and was encouraged there . He expects Congress will make available further public works appropriations from which the State can get 30 per cent of the cost of labor and materials for the proposed projects , the remainder of the cost being met by the State through the issue of bonds . Projects which the Governor is on record as favoring include the addition of 1,000 beds at the Fairfield State Hospital for the Insane , the establishment of another State institution for the feeble-minded , replacement of older buildings at State tuberculosis sanatoria , a State home for veterans and the establishment of a central jail farm . Since his statement , Thomas H. Beck , chairman of the State Board of Fisheries and Game , has suggested a further $1,000,000 in bonds for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bonds in the forthcoming session of the Legislature . The present bonded debt of the State , the last of which matures in , 1936 , is $13,336,100 , and on June 30 last , at the close of the fiscal year , the book value of the sinking fund for the retirement of the bonds was $14,302,396.35 . The fact , however , that in slightly more than a year the present bonds would be retired and the State would be without any funded debt will influence some sentiment against a further bond issue at this time . Needed for Immediate Use . The floating debt of the State , short-term borrowings in the last few years aS revenue has failed to equal income , can be retired in a relatively short time of business prosperity and normal tax income , some State fiscal authorities hold , but apparently only bonds or taxes can provide money for immediate institutional expansion . The prospects are that the pressure by the Governor and various welfare groups for more and better State institutions , with the appeal of getting some of the money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the State against further bonded debt . That means the fight on bond Issues in the 1935 session will be not on the question of whether bonds should be issued , but on holding the total of the issue to a fairly small sum .
