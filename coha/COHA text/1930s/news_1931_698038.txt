txt The Palls Stock Exchange has been dominated by the fluctuations in public confidence during the recent political and financial events which have shaken Europe . There seemed no possi-* Wily of introducing any rational element . Holders sold when things looked bad , and repurchasing followed when things bettered . The fluctuations simply reflected the uncertainty . It must be admitted that the French capitalist has been put to some hard tests1 Scarcely had he recovered from his previous trials , when the German crisis cropped up . He had thought that the Young Plan was final when it became evident that the French budget would ? have to provide at least one of the annual reparations payments . He had accepted this condition of things when suddenly he was confronted by the fact that suspension of the debt payments was not enough , and that the whole German financial system was menaced . The effect could only be demoralizing . Fortunately , the news from Berlin forecasting the collapse of Germany atilved during the French holiday for the National F ? te .

The chief note was the weakness of the French Reines. , the 3 per cent especially , which may be considered as the barometer of confidence and public calm . Calm was festered , but days of anxiety were passed through which will pave their traces . The shares of the big banks , in particular , slumped but have since almost regained their previous quotations . Even so , their shin eholders began to wonder if they had not placed too much money in Germany and if they were not themselves exposed to withdrawal of funds .

" French Count Losses Things now depend not only on the diplomatic negotiations , but upon the effort that Germany herself makes to save her finances and her currency . It may be observed that France , In 1926 , never had to call upon her foreiglk ci edits in older to pull through a situation which was no better than the present one The credits came in spontaneously from domestic and foreign sources , with the return of confidence , in the form of rush purchases of French securities and francs . Today , on the contrary , the French who have subscribed to Dawes and Young bonds are sadly counting their losses . These bonds were subscribed for quickly , because it was firmly believed that the reparations settlement was definite . Also , the French have never been able to believe that Germany , hard working as she is , could be ruined .

One had grown accustomed to thinking that the currency of the leading countries of the world wps stable , and very little interest was shown as regards exchange rates . It was therefore with surprise that one remarked that the pound sterling had fallen at one moment to below the gold point of issue , for if there is one accepted monetary dogma , it Is that the pound sterling is unchangeable . English securities are not generally taken up in France , and the British Consolidated issues are held by but a few Investors . However , there is a French Itente , known as a guaranteed exchange , the coupon of which is payable according to the pound sterling . This Rente was issued In 1925 , when M. Joseph Call-Wax was Finance Minister and it was then asked why the dollar had not been chosen as a unit of measure .
