One way to get the public to fly is to design a combination automobile and autogiro ( see above ) . Another way is to build standard airplanes so inexpensively that the public can afford them . Because this necessitates mass production methods such as many automobile makers already have , they have considered going into the business of making " flivver planes . " Last week such a flivver plane was sold . It was not made by an automobile manufacturer , but it was powered by a standard mass-produced automobile engine-the Ford V8 . <P> Arrow Aircraft Corp . of Lincoln , Neb. claims it is waiting only for the financial aspects of its founding to be settled before going into mass production in a few weeks to fill the 1,000-odd orders for flivver planes it has on hand . Its plane is a conventional lightweight , low-wing monoplane . The Ford motor is set in reverse position so that the propeller is attached where the clutch normally is when the engine is used on an automobile . Ford Motor Co. has no connection with Arrow @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but $150 apiece , including the conversion gear . So far Arrow has sold some half-dozen planes at $1,500 apiece . As soon as it can meet its production schedule of four planes a day , it expects to cut their price to $1,000 or lower . <P> Arrow Aircraft is a new subsidiary of Arrow Aircraft &; Motors Corp. , oldtime U. S. manufacturer of sport and training planes . Its new flivver plane has been three years in the making , recently passed Bureau of Air Commerce tests . <P> Expecting great things for it , Arrow 's President Mark W. Woods likes to point out that there are 40,000 licensed flyers , and students in the U. S. , only 7,000 planes .
