txt Mrs. McCormick 's Correspondence . To the Editor of The New York Times : I am sure that many of your readers besides myself have been greatly impressed by the power of penetration of a complicated political situation shown in Mrs. Anne O'Hare McCormick 's dispatch from Berlin , published . in Tne TIMMS of Monday last . This article is not merely a piece of journalism of the first order  --  reporting clearly one 's accurate observations  --  it is a product of a philosophic mind which for many years has been dealing with the problems of European politics in the comparative method which gives value to history . Mrs. McCormick knows the political situation and policies of most of Europe from the inside , and her exposition of the factors in Germany 's present storm and stress period is only a climi6 to many of her similar articles . Her writing is ' particularly impressive for her judgment of men and her sense of perspective . ROBERT UNDERWOOD JOHNSON . Stockbridge , Mass .. July 26 , 1933.        @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
