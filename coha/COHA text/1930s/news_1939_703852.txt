txt Prime Minister Chamberlain announced in the House of Commons that a cotton reorganization bill will be introduced next week . The bill is designed to put the industry on a profitable basis . The main proposals are to institute price fixing plans in various sections , to scrap redundant machinery and to formulate schemes for the promotion of export trade and to win back foreign markets . The bill is supported by 65% of the producing sections of all cotton trade unions . Merchants are opposed to the proposals . The measure is designed as a long term policy to maintain present domestic market and to bring about larger cloth exports . Fourteen delegates from England and the Continent , named by their respective governments to attend a biennial conference at Washington next week to discuss government cotton grading standards , arrived here yesterday on the Queen Mary . The delegates will be guests of New York Cotton Exchange officials at a luncheon at India House today .                    @
