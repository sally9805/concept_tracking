Last week from the auditorium walls of Washington 's new Department of Labor Building ten flat black &; tan faces stared importantly out over a large audience . In the audience , hundreds of three-dimensional black &; tan faces beamed pridefully back . The flat faces belonged to Federal Art Project portraits of men who have served the District of Columbia as Recorders of Deeds since Reconstruction days . The three-dimensional faces belonged to leaders of Washington 's largo Negro population who turned out in formal attire to witness the unveiling of the portraits . They had come to pay homage to a little administrative island in the U. S. Government which has remained in charge of colored folk for most of the past 60 years . <P> After the Civil War , U. S. Negroes began to clamor for official positions with the Government which had set them free . An active early colored Abolitionist was Frederick Augustus Washington Bailey , slave son of a slave mother by a white father . When he fled from Maryland to the North after the wife of his master had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his name to Frederick Douglass , became famed as an Abolition orator and editor . As his fame grew , Northern friends who feared he would be returned to Maryland under the Fugitive Slave Law sent him to England to drum up sympathy for his black brothers . Back in the U. S. after the War , Abolitionist Douglass became a potent leader of freed U. S. Negroes . In 1871 , President Grant appointed Frederick Douglass Assistant Secretary of the Santo Domingo Commission . President Grant 's appointment proved so popular with U. S. Negroes that President Garfield named Douglass Recorder of Deeds of the District of Columbia in 1881 , allowed him to staff his office with Negroes . Since then U. S. Presidents have failed to follow President Garfield 's precedent only twice . Present incumbent is colored William J. Thompkins appointed by President Roosevelt in 1934 . <P> Washingtonians of Southern extraction still dislike dealing with Negro clerks when they go to the Recorder 's office in the Century Building to file records of their real estate transactions . Dr. Thompkins , like other Negroes who have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ distinguished member of his race , the 56-year-old Missourian has studied at three universities . In Kansas City , where he is editor of the Kansas City American , he was first Negro superintendent of General Hospital No. 2 and chief of its surgical staff . <P> After last week 's ceremonies the Recorders ' portraits , which gave three months ' employment at $79 a month to three artists , were hung in the dusky corridors of Recorder of Deeds Thompkins ' offices .
