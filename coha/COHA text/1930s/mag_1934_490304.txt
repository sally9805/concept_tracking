MANY were the hardships of the winter ; it was a bleak season and tong . Now that spring is here we wonder how we managed to endure , for so extended a period , the sad sight of the Belmont Bar 's outdoor cafe in winter , its rustic chairs and tables lying dormant under the Forty-second Street snows . SPRING must be here : a distant reader reports that one thousand CWA workers appeared on the beach at Coney Island the other day and began sifting the sands to remove the orange peels of 1933 . THE TerrapI thing Terraplane a to advertisement m abou in n the March 10th issue of the Saturday Evening Poet is the people in the picture . There are about fifty or sixty of them , an admiring throng , paying homage to a fine red sedan . Take a gond look , though , and you will be agreeably surprised to discover that many of the folks are in the picture twice , rendering thereby a sort of double admiration fur Terraplane . That gent with the little mustache @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ once with a brown and once with a green hat . And the sad-looking bird with the brown cap and orange tie ( pardon , blue cap and brawn tie ) . And many others . We have n't had so much fun since prep - school days when our own group picture was taken and some of the sophomores ran around and got in twice , IT is hard to say anything really pithy about the cinema any more , but an old fellow aged eighty-nine managed to do it the other day . Blind almost all his life , he regained his sight recently and celebrated the event by going to a movie , reporters attending . After the picture he turned to one of the boys and said : " Maybe at your eighty-ninth birthday you 'll see even more wonderful things . I hope so . rrHERE comes a point in dentistry -- 1- when the chair no longer seems terrible , just as there comes a time in life when one accepts the fact of death . There is the same astringent quality in dentistry as in death @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , whining , round noise . It is strange that the body should adjust to arty disciplined and controlled persecution , yet it does ; pain becomes at last its own anesthesia , and the very ruthlessness of a whirling drill sets up a sweet insensibility . The event becomes universal ; one sees oneself not as the individual victim of disaster but as the personification of general disaster  --  meets it as one would meet . death , in a postore of clumsy , misshapen resignation , slumped down , mouth open in a grimace . In the only dental tragedy we ever heard of , it was not the patient who gave up , but the dentist . He stood it as long as he could , then jumped out of the window . QIJR lawmakers are not agreed on N --  ? the split infinitive . In the course of the air-mail pother we noted that the Messrs . Jones and White , authors of the Jones-White Act , stated their purpose in this manner : " To further develop an American Merchant Marine . . . " while @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ McNaryWatres Act , stated theirs in this wise : " Further to encourage commercial aviation ? .. " Well , now ! To further develop , further to encourage , to further develop , further to encourage  --  which shall it be , men ? We 're no purist , ourself Let 's see , how does that song go : " Have you ever seen an infinitive splitting ? " THE French have a more tender postal consciousness than we Americans have . We were noticing one of their cancellation marks on an envelope recently . It was nothing stern and abrupt , like " The United States Army Builds Men , " or " Shop Early , Wrap Securely . " Theirs said : " Aimez , Protgez le Pigeon Voyageur , Serviteur du Pays . " When France incites her people it is to love and protect pigeons . Has our Mr. Farley ever loved and protected a carrier pigeon ? WE 'VE occasionally re- ferred to England 's uncanny grasp of American slang . The most recent proof of it appears in a blurb from British International @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , speaking of the performance of a certain actor in the films , describes it as " what Americans sometimes call a whow . ' " They mean a woops , of course . ) Trouble , Trouble THE Telephone Company gets it- self so snarled up in the involved web it has spun in this great city that sometimes we wonder whether , if it had it all to do over again , it would n't go into some other line of work . Take the case of Miss Emily Marx vs . The Phone Company . When an installer put in a phone for her , in her penthouse on East Seventy-seventh Street , he asked permission to leave , overnight , another phone , which he said he was going to install next day in an apartment nearby . He never came hack for it . Miss Marx , who has the standard grudges against the Telephone Company , got tired of seeing that dead instrument lying there in a corner , but her phone calls and letters about it were unavailing . Finally she wrote the company @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ phone was n't removed , she would charge the company five dollars a month storage for it . It still was n't removed , and when , two months later , she came back from Europe to find the instrument lying there , she deducted ten dollars when she paid her next bill . The company accepted the check but added ten dollars to her next bill . Another month having gone by that time , Miss Marx deducted fifteen dollars . This stirred up some action . A brisk young adjuster called around at the apartment , and was perturbed to discover that Miss Marx is a practicing lawyer and that she was quite determined about the storage charges . He said there was no provision for paying such an item . She said he better dig tip a provision for paying it . He left , so flustered that he forgot to take the phone with him . Next day a vice-president of the Phone Company called her up and strove to dismiss the whole affair lightly , as a joke . The laughter was not general , for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a disinstaller came and took away the phone , but said he could n't do anything about the storage charges . All he did was come and take phones away . " Where have you been the last four months ? " she asked . He said he 'd been busy . Then one day Miss Marx was called up in her office by the same executive who had failed to laugh the matter off . " Miss Marx ? " he asked . " Yes , " she said . " Can you tell me how to find the address of a lawyer named John Doc Smith ? " he asked , giving the name of a real attorney . " Why- , in the phone hook , " said Miss Marx , in some surprise . " Thank you , " said the Phone Company man . " And how could I find the latest legal report concerning suchand-such ? " ? naming some legal business or other . " Why , your own law library would have it , " she said , still surprised . " Thank @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , if you will send us your bill for the legal services you have just rendered , making the charges equal , if you will , to the storage charges for that phone , we shall settle the matter . VL-re find no provision for payment of that item other than in this way . Thank you again , and goodbye . " " Goodbye , " said Miss Marx . And that , my dears , is how old Grandfather Phone Company met the storage charges . ? AYOUNG Diana who hoarded a bus in Greenwich Village tripped and nearly fell , and as she caught her breath and climbed aboard , she said to the conductor , " Heavens ! I almost broke my neck that time . " A block or two farther along , she tells us , when the conductor presented his dime-snatcher , he remarked pleasantly , " It 's a long time since I 've heard any-body say that . " " Say what ? " she asked . " ' Heavens ! ' " he said , and added , " You just @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Store SOMEBODY told us about a new snake store here and we dutifully went down to Fulton Street to investigate . It 's there , opened up last year by Mr. Henry Trefflich as a branch of his father 's business in Germany . The Mr. Trefflich who is here is blond , twenty-five , and the last to date of a long line of snake-and-animal dealers . Under the New Deal , American zoos , circuses , and amusement parks have been buying so heavily of late that he decided to open the store here . Individuals are buying more snakes and animals , too , for private zoos or for pets . So far , the local branch has only pythons 4ntl monkeys in stock , but Mr. Trefflich will take orders for most anything . Pythons are having a certain popularity as garden pets , we were told , possibly because they sleep most of the time and eat only once a month or so . Not much trouble . They 're lazy , and hug only when hungry , and the trick is to get them to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and not with you . Two or three rabbits are an average meal , or a dozen fat rats . A python pit is easy to make . If a py thon has a fountain and a pile of rocks to sleep around and under , he is content . He needs water because he comes from a marsh in Min . You have to put a wire cage over the top of the pit so he wo n't get out . If you buy a python , Mr. Trefflich will throw in a cage . A python never bites , just nips playfully . He lives to a hundred or a hundred and fifty , so if you get him young  --  say , thirty or forty  --  your grandchildren will have a chance to get fond of him . Price depends on size , running from $50 for a eve-footer to $400 for a twenty-footer . Mr. Trefflich sold two twenty-footers to a sideshow at the Chicago Fair last year . He had two twenty-footers in stock the day we called , all that were left of a shipment @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were wound about each other and sleeping soundly . Travelling doctors and even city drugstores buy pythons , usually smaller ones , to advertise snake oil . A gas-station proprietor recently bought one to attract attention to his stand . People like Vincent Astor , George F. Getz , and Mr. Kellogg of Corn Flakes have had pythons in their zoos for years , of course . For lap pets , Mr. Trefflich advocates Texas bull snakes . Many suburbanites keep them , he says . They are from three to six feet long , and arc harmless , faithful , and affectionate . You can keep them in basements , where they live off the country , so to speak , on the local fauna  --  mice , insects , etc . They grow to know their owners well and will learn to come when called , rushing upstairs delightedly-when company comes . Mr. Trcfflich had three hundred monkeys in stock the day we were at his place , part of a recent consignment from India . Some of the tamer ones were running around loose . Caged or uncagcd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ obtain , on order , polar hears , Indian sun hears , rattlesnakes , kangaroos , dikeliks ( antelopes ) , elephants , hyenas , and many other things . South of Boston SPE AKING of B. Altman 's , said a young woman to us the other day , could you stand one more story about the place ? Well , we began ? All right , she said , T used to work there , selling misses ' dresses , and there always came to me when she was in town a sweet Boston spinster who still wears corset-covers with pink ribbon run through the eyelets . This lady told me one day of a great adventure she had had in our " long shrill city , " as Henry James once called it . She had always wanted to shop at S. Klein 's , but terror had invariably held her hack until one day she just got spunky and decided to go in and buy a dress , come what might , so in she went ! She picked out something to try on and , in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shoves , she reeled into a big-hosted Manhattan woman and gave her a small bump . " Oh , " said the Boston lady in her Boston accent , " I beg your pardon ! " The big woman pulled on the dress she was struggling with , gave the lady from Massachusetts a hard look , and said , " If you 're so gandam polite , why n't you go shop at Altman 's ? " Old Pictures BROWN BROTHERS have the largest collection of photographs in the world  --  snore than a million . You 've probably seen hundreds of them , for they 've been reproduced in everything , from the Police Gazette to the Britannica . The firm started in 1904 in one small room , but its shelves now take up most of the top floor of 1482 Broadway . There were two brothers to begin with , Arthur and Charles , but the latter died . They started out buying up the negatives of those old double photographs that people used to look at through stereoscopes . Mr. Brown owns the negatives of most @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ two hundred thousand . They sold so well the brothers added ordinary photographs to their stock . In the old days , newspapers did n't have staff photographers , and most of them called on the Browns , who had twelve cameramen . Once in a while , the brothers took pictures themselves . One day in 1904 , Arthur Brown arrived late at a ship on which John D. Rockefeller wassailing . Brown did n't know that all photographers had been ordered off the ship , so he sauntered aboard and , when Rockefeller came up the gangplank , snapped him . He made five hundred dollars out of that negative . On Easter morning in 1905 , he saw two fine ladies come out of St. Bartholomew 's and get into a victoria . He did n't know who they were , but he took their picture and asked a vestryman . They turned out to be Mrs. Cornelius Vanderbilt and her ( laughter Gladys , who through the years had steadily refused to he photographed . Brown has made fifteen hundred dollars on that negative . Thirty years @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Twain writ ing in bed . Brown sent one of his men to the Twain home at Fifth Avenue and Ninth Street , and the author posed . When a print of the picture was shown to him later , Twain noticed a peculiar illusion . The pillow and his hair together gave the appearance of a little child , all bundled up , whispering in his ear . He was so delighted that he wrote a poem about the whispering child , and Harper- 's II cekly printed it . In 1910 , Brown sent a photographer named Barney Roos to New Haven to take pictures of the graduating exercises at Yale for the Times . What the Times mostly wanted was a picture of Robert Taft , the President 's son , who was graduating , but Taft refused to pose for Roos . On his disconsolate way to the station to take a train back to New York , Roos heard a fire engine coming , and with his last plate snapped it . As he did so , he noticed , to his great consternation , Robert @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sidewalk thirty feet away , watching the fire engine . But Roos had no plates left . When the picture was developed , he saw he had caught young Taft in the background , but partially obscured by the figure of another man . He was afraid to tell Brown shout the incident and hoped his boss would n't notice Taft in the picture . Brown did n't . Two years after that , Roos left Brown Brothers and never visited the office afterward until the other day , when he dropped in to see his old employer . Twenty-two years had elapsed . He had seen the fire-engine picture reproduced in " The American Procession , " a collection of old-time photographs , mainly from Brown Brothers ' collection . He told Mr. Brown the whole story and pointed out Taft . Mr. Brown was hugely amused and said that more prints of the fire engine have been sold than of all the Taft family put together . Roos , by the way , is now president of the Society of Automotive Engineers . Brown charges from three dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Teddy Roosevelt laughing . He sells about twenty prints of it a year at Eve dollars each . The rarest item in his collection is the first photograph ever made of a human face , a picture of a young lady named Dorothy Draper , taken in 1840 . He also has a picture of her taken fifty years later , when she was an old lady . His Mark A GENTLEMAN was waiting for his wife at the Dunhill corner on Fifth Avenue of a late afternoon when a gray but husky workman wearing overalls and smoking a pipe approached him and said , " Would you like to hear a story ? " The other thought it was going to he a touch , but it was n't . The workman pointed at the hydrant located on the south side of Fiftieth Street a few feet west of Fifth Avenue . " Ye see that ? " he said . " Well , I put it there thirty-seven years ago , I put it in and then the foreman fired me . Guess that was before you was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I stop and look at me handiwork . There 's been some changes hereabouts since then . There was a hotel over there where Saks ' is now . You 'll excuse me for talkin ' to you . " With that he headed north , puffing on his pipe . Lady Lawyer NATURALLY , we got interested in Miss Fanny E. Holtzmann when we read that counsel for the defence in the $126,000 **30;739;TOOLONG libel suit had testily blessed her in mitred legal language as being " in back of the whole thing . " We succeeded in interviewing Miss Holtzmann a few days ago and found out that counsel for the defence was right , in that Miss Holtzmann instigated the action . She is reluctant to discuss the details of the case but told us that she became the Princess Youssoupoff 's counsel last spring when she met her on the Riviera . The Princes had been distressed at reports of the Rasputin movie and had left a power of attorney with an American lawyer . The American lawyer had n't done anything much and this had further @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ agreeing to do something , with the results known to date and further suits threatened against all exhibitors who have shown the picture in this or any other country . Miss Boltzmann is small and buxom , with bright-red lips and fingernails , and dark bobbed hair . We had heard of her vaguely as a theatrical lawyer and as the highest-paid woman lawyer in the world . She said she probably is , but that it 's a kind of piffling distinction . She has an office in the Bar Building at 36 Vest Forty-fourth Street and lives with her parents at 147 West Seventy-ninth . Unmarried . In her youth , she always wanted to be a lawyer like her much older brother , Jacob L. , who now has offices in Wall Street . She used to skip school and hang around law offices and courts . One day when she was twelve , her brother sent her to a Brooklyn court ( the family lived in Brooklyn then ) to say at the proper moment , " Ready for the plaintiff , " which was all that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her brother , who came over leisurely . She took a law degree at Fordham in 1922 and passed her bar exams the next year . Two weeks before she took the exams , she rented the office in the Bar Building , to the astonishment of many males , and furnished it . She opened up for business half an hour after she had been admitted to the bar , She had had an office prior to that , however . Before she had finished at Fordham , she had persuaded a firm for which she had been doing some night work to open a one-room theatrical branch in the Astur Theatre Building with her in charge . They were to keep the total receipts and she was to receive seventy-five dollars a week . She opened up in the Astor the day after she got her degree . When she started her own office , many of her theatrical clients followed her , and now she represents people like Noel Coward , Gertrude Lawrence , and Ethel Barry-more , and has hired one of her former employers to help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ London , with secretaries in them to whom she telephones almost daily . She has n't changed a stick of furniture in the home office since she moved in . She 's superstitious and thinks something would happen if she did . While we were talking to her , her secretary told her that Mr. Somebody was calling from England . " Ca n't talk to him now , " said Miss Holtzmann . She told us it was her beau , her best beau . She seems to have a knack . She showed us a letter from a duchess about the Youssoupoff case . The duchess had had fountain-pen trouble , even as you and I , and had had to finish in pencil . The note said : " So glad for you  --  and them . V. R. " Quartet ON one of those freezing evenings of a few weeks ago , four Cornell students piled into an automobile and started to drive up to Ithaca . Fifteen miles out of town , they got a flat . In the icy road the young men tried to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rim . They abandoned the ear and began signalling to passing drivers to Hick them up , but nobody would stop . It got colder and colder , and they ran up and down to keep warns , still signalling . Finally , the driver of a big car slowed up cautiously and peered out at them . They explained they were Cornell students and what had happened , but the motorist seemed wary . They might he bandits . At length he had a bright idea . " Sing ' Ear Above Cayuga 's Waters , ' " he said to them . They huddled together in the cold and sang the Cornell song all the way through . He opened the door and took them in.
