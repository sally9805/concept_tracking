Fortnight ago the St. Louis City Art Museum announced with pride that it had acquired an Egyptian bronze statue of a cat for $14,400 from Manhattan Art Dealer Joseph Brummer . Same day , St. Louis newspapers carried a pathetic story about the eviction of a family of eight for failure to pay $15 a month rent . The conjunction of these news items proved too much for the editorial sense of the St. Louis Star-Times , which published an open letter to the cat informing it that its " visit " was ill-timed . Wrote the Star-Times : <P> " Our refusal to welcome you , Dear Cat , is not to be taken as a personal slight , but merely as our protest against spending taxpayers ' money for ancient art objects . . . with a relief crisis in our midst . " <P> By last week museum and cat were the subject of public clamor . Members of the Women 's Chamber of Commerce called on the mayor for repeal of the special tax from which the museum derived $239,000 last year . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to hospitals . Pickets sweltered at City Hall complaining that the cat was an affront to Labor . Six St. Louis members of the American Artists ' Congress chimed in with a demand that the museum buy " indigenous " art . " It is hard for many of us , " said they , " to see the lasting value to a 20th-Century community in the purchase of an Egyptian cat . . . . " <P> Last year the St. Louis City Art Museum received 330,000 visits from St. Louisans , listed few purchases of contemporary art . Disinterested citizens last week were able to debate this policy while doubting not at all the " lasting value " of the cat , an image of the Goddess Ubasti from the 6th Century B.C. Comparable to great similar bronzes in the Louvre , the Metropolitan Museum , the Cleveland Museum and the Bliss Collection in Washington , D. C. , it possesses , as the museum eloquently pointed out , " in a static pose , the strength and snap of a taut bow string . "    @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
