txt Sounding a note of confidence In victory next Fall , Democrats of the country assembled in force for the annual Jefferson Day dinner of the National Democratic Club at the Commodore last night and heard Senator Robert J. Bulkley of Ohio demand inclusion of a prohibition referendum plank in the national platform of the party . With leaders from all parts of the nation gathered for the ceremony , Senator Bulkley , Senator J. Hamilton Lewis of Illinois and other speakers , introduced by Mayor Walker as toastmaster , avoided injection of opinions about candidates for the party nomination for President , but insisted on party harmony to insure capitalization of what they avowed was a genuine opportunity for Democratic conquest in the national elections . Senator Bulkley put his plea for a party plank for a referendum on repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment on economic as well as broadly social grounds . He asserted that ' vast sources of tax revenue were being lost through the failure of government regulation of the sale of alcoholic beverages and asserted . that the growing burden of taxation could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Assailed . He joined with Senator Lewis and other speakers in assailing the Hoo- ' ver Administration on the ground of false promises of prosperity in the election of 1928 and declared that the skies for Democratic victory in November were bright . Senator Lewis . the " favorite-son " candidate of Illinois , distributed praise equally between former Governor Smith and Governor Roosevelt for the stand they took on governmental policies of the Republican Administration . More than 1,600 persons gathered for the dinner , and the party chieftains of New York as well as representatives from many other States were present . John F. Curry , Tammany leader ; John H. McCooey , Brooklyn chieftain ; Senator Elmer Thomas of Oklahoma and virtually all of the New York leaders were on hand . Both the New York Democratic Senators , Robert F. Wagner and Royal S. Copeland , were on the dais , with Senator Copeland speaking briefly , and through the audience were many dignitaries of the party in State and nation . Calls for a Wet Declaration . Senator Bulkley , who won his seat on a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Walker presented him . He reviewed the main trends in legislation at Washington before setting forth his views on prohibition and the Democratic party . " The Eighteenth Amendment to the Constitution of the United States must be and can be and will be repealed , " he declared . " It is unthinkable that we should go on indefinitely wasting the public money in a futile attempt to enforce the dhenforceable , to make a crime out of what millions of people do not regard as a moral wrong . It is unthinkable that we shall continue to increase taxes which are hard to bear while maintaining tax exempt the great traffic in intoxicating beverages . And , above all , it is unthinkable that we should continue a system which gives to an illicit trade the wherewithal to finance every sort of racketeering and crime and to corrupt law enforcement as it was never before corrupted , and an of this largely at the cost of the Federal treasury itself , which must tax our letters , our automobiles and our amusements in order to preserve untouched the corrupt @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the first step toward ending this disgraceful situation by inserting in our national platform a pledge that our Democratic Senators and Congressmen will vote for a resubmission of the Eighteenth Amendment to constitutional conventions of the several States . Makes Revenue Plea Also . " And in the meantime we should provide a much-needed increase in our Federal revenues if we would but abandon that falsehood written into a Federal statute which enacts that any alcoholic content in excess of one-half of 1 per cent makes a beverage intoxicating . I am proud to have participated , as a member of the subcommittee of the Senate Committe on Manufactures , in bringing out a favorable report upon a bill to amend the Volstead act so as to legalize 4 per cent beer . " Unless we can secure the repeal of the Eighteenth Amendment , or at least agree upon some reasonable change in the statutory definition of intoxicating liquor , we are facing . and will continue to face , the necessity for heavy taxation  --  taxation that will discourage business and prolong our period of unemployment . This burden @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ debts and sacred preservation of the public faith ' which was prescribed as a fundamental principle by Jefferson . " Confident of Victory . Senator Bulkley synthesized the attitude assumed by a majority of the speakers on the chances of victory when he said : " That this year will bring a change in the National Administration is a generally accepted fact . That is a Democratic opportunity , but correspondingly a Democratic responsibility . The times are so far out of joint that unprecedented and radical remedies may be necessary . One such unprecedented and radical remedy has already been enacted as a non-partisan measure . Perhaps it would be more exact to call it a palliative rather than a remedy . I refer to the Reconstruction Finance Corporatfon act , which made government credit up to $2,000,000,000 available to assist distressed banks and railroads , with the ultimate purpose of saving and benefiting business generally . " Other momentous suggestions have been made , and undoubtedly there will be more , possibly still more revolutionary in character , before we are safely through with the business difficulties which beset @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ its prospective responsibility for solving these difficult problems , must make itself ready with united party spirit and cooperation , because it is clear this new responsibility must be taken as a party responsibility . " Democrats must be willing to give and take , and to adjust opinions on matters of party policy so that we may have a united party with a definite party program and a party responsibility that the country can rely upon . We know too well the danger of failure in this respect . " The Ohio Senator went on to praise the part played by Speaker Garner of the House in fostering helpful legislation for the country and suggested the possible necessity of issuing Federal bonds for public works to insure adequate unemployment relief . He also struck out at " certain officers " of the American Bankers Association who , he said , were attempting to defeat the Glass bank revision bill . The attacks of these " certain officers , " the Senator said , had possessed " exaggerated vehemence " and were unfounded . Senator Lewis declared that not President Hoover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ political oligarchy " of big business as represented by the dominating influence in the Republican party should receive the blame for excesses in the current depression . He continued : " Here we summon America to note the Cause of the situations now existing in the Republic of the United States  --  its citizens in poverty , its farmers in bankruptcy , its finance in destruction , its pursuits of all undertakings blockaded and obstructed , while the citizen of the United States stands before the world with his arms extended as for charity while he presents himself as a beggar upon the generosities of mankind . What has done this thing ? " Let us speak with undisguised truth . The President of the United States can never rise higher than the source which creates him and that to which he yields . It must not be that democracy shall content itself with the blame put upon President Hoover as responsible for the present conditions of distress and disaster . Let it be told that those who nominated him and they who have been given the privilege to control the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the affairs of commerce and finance are these to whom the President extends the power of his administration under the theory that he believes their representations to be just and their course to be the best for the Republic , or that though he would differ from their presentations , or he obeys political party organization  --  to this force he surrenders . To this political oligarchy is justly to be charged the real responsibility for the conditions that are now endured by the Republic in the suffering of its business and the perils of its citizenship . Attacks Finance Policies . " Why was it that our government , under ' such conditions as we knew surrounded the world with its finance tightening , its moneys being monopolized , let the masters of finance seize the treasury of the Republic and through its agency , , the Federal Reserve Banks , and their ally of government , allowing millions and millions of money to the extent . of four billions ? per- month and this speculation in gambling marts granted to the favorites while the millions of Americans were denied @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " This horror and indefensible administration crime seemed to be exempt from citicism , and neither in press nor in public character could a voice be heard until the National Democratic Convention met in 1928 ; and then came from the candidate of the Democracy the protest and the cry for the punishment of the offenders and on behalf of the great , broad democracy demanding equal opportunity and denouncing special privileges . " Alfred E. Smith was the first to speak the denunciation and to defy the authors of the infamy . Then let it be recalled that that other distinguished New Yorker , now the Governor of the State of New York , was the first who pointed out how these magnates of power were seizing in their hands even the instrumentalities of water , heat and the elements that served the sick and the dying , and from Franklin D. Roosevelt came the first appeal and signal call to his countrymen to beware of the advanc-i that was being made on their rights by the great power no one seemed able to understand or seemed to condemn @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the time we could have prepared to meet our situations was there no voice from the administration warning the finance or commerce of its danger ? Why was there not one single protest against the riotous gambling of stock and speculation of the finance of America by those who are privileged to drain America for their private purses ? Where was there a voice against the orgy that drained the resources of agriculture and led to the looting of the banks by which more than two billions of cash are now confessed by the perpetrators of the offense to be lost to the citizen and in the thousands of . banks that crumbled and were crushed from inner lootings ? " William H. Hickin , president of the club , added to Senator Bulkley 's plea for a change in prohibition conditions his demand for repeal . Other speakers , all optimistic of party victory next Fall , were Mrs. Edward Porter Humphrey of Louisville , Ky. , and Virglnius R.
