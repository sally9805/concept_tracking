In a vacant lot in Eastchester , suburb about 16 miles from Manhattan , four handsome dogs-a white collie , a dachshund , a setter and a German shepherd ( " police dog " ) - were at play one day fortnight ago . Up rolled a limousine and out stepped a lady who seemed to be fond of animals . She patted each friendly head , seemingly gave each dog something to eat from her handbag . Then the lady climbed back in the car , where her own sweatered Boston bull was yapping in excitement . The automobile rolled away and the four dogs continued to caper in the sun . <P> Soon the setter 's plume drooped and he trotted slowly home . Police dog and collie also turned tail , as did the low-slung , swaybacked little dachshund . The setter 's owner rushed him to a veterinarian , where he shortly died . Said the " vet " : " Someone has given this dog cyanide of potassium ! " <P> Next day the police dog had also died , and when the dachshund @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ other recent dog deaths and disappearances . The police turned out to hunt for " 75 dogs reported missing or poisoned within the past few months . " <P> In the midst of this hue &; cry , an East-chesterite who had seen the dogs at play suddenly remembered the lady of the limousine . A license number was recalled , telephones tinkled and soon the police dog 's owner had signed a complaint against Mrs. Julia Tuttle , a 65-year-old , well-to-do Larchmont widow . Late that night a detective pounded on Mrs. Tuttle 's door . She was arrested on charges of dog-poisoning ( for which one may be jailed a year in New York State ) and taken before a Justice of the Peace , who set $500 bail after she pleaded not guilty . <P> In view of the public dog-poisoning hysteria , her lawyer obtained a fortnight 's stay of trial . Pointing out that Mrs. Tuttle had for years been an S. P. C. A. worker , a contributor to Manhattan 's famed Ellin Prince Speyer Animal Hospital , he said : " Mrs. Tuttle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . . Mrs. Tuttle likes dogs , and it is not unusual that she stopped to feed some . " <P> Said Mrs. Charles H. Reisig of Larchmont , honorary president of the Larchmont-Mamaroneck Humane Society : " I was the means of having her Mrs. Tuttle banished from our society when it was charged that she put beautiful , expensive pets , principally cats , to death in the Larchmont police station , where they had a gas tank . " Said President William Bevan of the Westchester County Animal Protective League : " I 've known Mrs. Tuttle for years . . . . There must be a misunderstanding somewhere . "
