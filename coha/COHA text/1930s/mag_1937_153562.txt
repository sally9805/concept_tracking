When a veterinarian named Solomon Shapera took a house in Eastchester , N. Y. three months ago , he made his presence known by placing upon his lawn a life-size statue of a St. Bernard dog painted in lively colors . Despite the fact that the statue is not iron but stone , the neighborhood named the dog " Iron Mike , " but did not suppose there was much that could be done about it . Some people said that since it was Dr. Shapera 's business to treat dogs , the statue was an advertisement and therefore violated a district zoning ordinance . The veterinarian retorted that it was not an advertisement but a work of art-just as artistic , in his eyes , as a marble nymph or a cast-iron deer . One of Dr. Shapera 's neighbors happens to be Dr. Raymond Lee Ditmars , famed reptile man of the Bronx Zoo . Dr. Ditmars not only declared Iron Mike to be " as offensive as a cigar-store Indian and as emblematic as the three balls over a pawnbroker 's shop , " but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Eastchester 's Zoning Board of Appeals ordered Dr. Shapera to get Iron Mike off his lawn and out of sight . The veterinarian flatly refused . Town Counsel William Olsen threatened to seek an injunction , whereupon Dr. Shapers hired lawyers to contest the action . Iron Mike , his tongue hanging out , his coat of paint scrubbed carefully by Dr. Shapera 's housekeeper , continued to gaze benignly at genteel Eastchester.
