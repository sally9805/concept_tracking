MEN still do that when they meet a woman . At least many of them do . But has the gesture become almost empty ? Surely almost all the reverence and illusion have drained out of it and there is not much devotion left . It is true that there is a glint of admiration in many a man 's eye as he salutes a woman which would not have been there forty years ago , when he would have been taking off his hat to her innocence and her ankles . He knows now that she may make as much money as he does ; in some cases more . He knows that she can take care of herself ; if necessary she could possibly take care of him . She may be the mother of children ; but again and very deliberately and decisively she may not . She may know almost as many stories as the man does , and the sane kind . He may see her in a bar as well as a drawing-room and have to accept her presence in both places @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lessened and he know it . In the same ratio his gallantry las dwindled . Nor does it stop with a negative attitude . Men are saing hard things about women . They e writing bitterly and cruelly of them In a quick survey of half a down t%-ently published and widely read nave , ( all written by men ) I found only to major characterizations of women with were not to a large extent exposure.of infidelity , promiscuity , selfishness , reed , and inconsistency . Of the two , e , cepted characterizations one was that of a woman who lived on a farm and never stirred from it and one of a woman belonging to an earlier generation . The others were not supposed to be portraits of evil women . They were offered as faithful likenesses of the sort of women we see about us every day , who are physically attractive , able to hold jobs , contemporary in every way . The point of view of these writers is that of many other men , though somewhat less frankly admitted . They may not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in spite of deep personal affections and high regard for individual women , men regard the contemporary woman with a wariness that amounts to suspicion . There is great skepticism regarding her motives and her loyalties . And I have come so often upon a definite resentment toward women in the minds and in the statements of men that it seems to me to prove that women have something new to face and to consider . It looks sometimes as if pre-suffrage conditions even might be curiously reversed and the grievance held by women against men be changed into a grievance held by men against women . We can do well without illusion between the sexes . Some women are sorry to have so little left because it was their temperamental stock in trade . But illusion was one thing that every honest feminist was quite ready to exchange for a better understanding beTHEY RAISE tween men and women , and she was ready to throw in some of her comforts and protections into the bargain . What she wanted was a friendly and equable understanding between the sexes , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it , there is no better time than the present to look into the matter and see whether it is her own fault or men 's fault or inherent in the situation . II Apparently one always overstates in a discussion of the attitude of one sex toward the other . It is not because one wants to do so but because the individual relations between men and women do not quite add up to the sum total of the relations between the sexes . Hundreds of thousands of happy marriages and passionate love affairs went on in an era historically marked as the one when women were " lighting for their rights . " If now the general attitude of men toward women is tinged with resentment , it is equally true that it is not his own Anne or his dear Susie who affronts the average man . Nearly every man , either occasionally or habitually , has an Anne or a Susie for whom he is willing to work and sacrifice and whom he loves . Yet he may have an inarticulate grudge against women as a sex @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ put the responsibility of an extra or an unloved woman upon him and it will break out . It will often show in his casual attitude toward women political appointees or toward married women who work . Men are critical of a sex which has become competitive and expensive ; whose financial and industrial achievements are taking bread out of men 's mouths and occupation out of their hands ; whose desire for political recognition has not been backed up by a willingness to take political punishment ; whose morality has beTHEIR come erratic , undisciplined , and unreliable and yet claims the protection of the law as easy virtue has never done before ; and whose social cost is no longer justified by their domestic industry nor by the extent of their childbearing . Much of this indictment is extremely unfair . The limitation of childbearing is aided , abetted , and often instigated by men . Women put bread into men 's mouths as well as take it out . But those facts do not destroy the general ill-will . For this is not a question of personal justice @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and which almost every man will be generous enough to make , when you pin him down to cases . You will ask , " But what would Mary Smith 's family do if she did n't go out and earn some money ? " The answer will be , " Well , Mary 's an exception . It 's all right for her . But a lot of these women do n't need it . " I know . I 've often been told I 'm an exception in just that way . " When , just now , one meets a great deal of definite , clear-cut resentment shown by unemployed men toward employed women there is nothing surprising . It is one more unpleasant outgrowth of the depression . There are not enough jobs to go round , and if some big group has to go without them naturally there is a feeling that the dejobbed group should be women . The feeling has reached an abnormal height just now because of the scarcity of employment . I have often heard lately the remark ? perhaps not @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ them ? that if women would only get out of industry the depression would be over . They usually add that they refer to women who could " get along without the money . " Now in 1930 , according to statistics quoted in Mary Branch 's excellent book , Women and Wealth , there were ten million , seven hundred and seventy-eight thousand , seven hundred and ninety-four women gainfully employed in the United States . There are many less employed to-day and less gainfully . I can not tell you , nor can Miss Branch , nor can anyone else , how many of the women who are still employed could " get along " without the money they earn . I do know , mentally running over the list of my own women friends and acquaintances who earn money , that only a very few of them could live without public or private help and that many would have very little chance of even becoming pensioners on male relatives . Barbara D. would have to take not only her mother and father but her husband 's father to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ efficient secretary with a three-times-cut salary . Miss G. , who is a librarian , has a family dependent on her . You can multiply such cases indefinitely . Yet it is possibly true that if all women would stay home some morning and let men take their places , things might be easier for Mr. Hopkins temporarily . This sounds fantastic , but these are fantastic times when queer ideas are at large , and it is conceivable that an antifeminist dictator might promulgate just such a ruling . It would mean that men would teach in the public schools in far greater numbers than now . But this is being considered . A man educator assured me the other day that , except in the kindergarten and primary grades , men could do this adequately and that teachers ' colleges were filling up with men who hoped to supplant women in the schools . Men also would take over millions of jobs that women hold in shops , factories , and kitchens , and very unpleasant and underpaid they would find plenty of them . But this idea is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not help matters greatly except by dealing with enormous groups , and here is a group that is becoming unpopular . Angry as the injustice toward women makes me , and preposterous as the notion of replacing them in industry and professional life by men seems to be , there is yet something in the situation which arouses pity for men . There they are , convinced that they are job holders by nature , and forced to sit at home or idly walk the streets while many girls and women have work and wages . The insult is not individual . It is offered to a sex which is deprived of its proper function . If there is not enough work to go round , men believe they should have first right to what little there is . For women can still be dependent without losing face while the same is not true of men . Men offer a further argument for their own preferment , and it is at this point that their criticism of women in industry seems to depart from the exigencies of the present situation . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women 's minds are less on their work than on their personal relations . The criticism that the hunt for lovers and husbands goes on during office hours has far too much truth in it to be disproved . It is a criticism of women in industry that preceded our present difficulties , has been raised to a new pitch of bitterness , and will probably go along with us into whatever order we ultimately achieve . When a woman does marry and " holds on to her job as well as the man " the resentment is apt to be greater , no matter how great her efficiency or her personal contribution . This is a serious and unjust situation and it may get still worse . Laws are being introduced in various legislatures to make it illegal for married women to hold positions in public schools . Stupid , sweeping laws like that are threatening . In the past few months I have often been called upon , in those places where I might have some slight influence , to defend some woman 's right to hold her job @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to women 's paid work that surprised me . III But women can not escape the resentment of men by becoming dependent . That is another catch . Men are beginning to figure up what an idle woman costs in a very ungallant manner . Not long ago a gentleman said to me , out of one of those clear conversational skies from which interesting comment falls , " Now here 's a funny thing . In that one mile from Barker Street to the old library there are forty-nine widows ? ' It seemed a lot of widows to me too , but before I could express any opinion he went on " Forty-nine of them , all doing nothing , all living on what some man scraped together before he died . Most of them are living on insurance . " He spoke thoughtfully but resentfully . " Oh , well , " I suggested , " maybe they earned it while their husbands were alive . " He shook his head . " No , " he said , " I do n't believe that . A few @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ have to he taken care of ; but they cost too much . They cost , " he added confidentially , " a lot more than they arc worth to society . " That was an interesting personal interpretation of the fact , set forth by a Chicago investment house a few years ago , that women were beneficiaries of eighty per cent of the ninety-five billion dollars of life-insurance policies then in force in the United States . It does look as if , in spite of working women , a great many others are still being supported . I did not know all the forty-nine widows whom ' he gentleman mentimed , but I did know some of them . I knew enough to prove to him on the spot that some did not cost more than they were worth , that they used their time and their money in public and private ways , scrupulously and to great advantage to others , sending boys and girls to school , keeping families together , and so on . I also could inform him that some of the widows , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and expand their spirits . But where the gentleman had the best of me was that I myself could see that these were a minority and that most of the others contributed little to society except purchasing power . They saw their friends on small , repetitive social occasions . They did little housework . They built days out of meals in tearooms , new movies , gossip , doctors ' visits . They voted if you reminded them to do so , and it was often just as well to direct their choice . And though they did no harm ? not one of them ? it was true , as their critic said , that if you looked at the matter coldly , they were very expensive . It is too bad that truth must sometimes sound so cruel . It is usually so much less so when traced to its sources . For the gentleman 's criticism , though possibly true , did not seek to look back of the immediate lives of those women into the way that , with the connivance and encouragement of their husbands @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not entirely their fault that as widows they should become useless to the world or cost too much . Their husbands had not helped them to learn or to store away abilities and interests and knowledge against the passing of desire and the intrusion of death . The man who had made these statements probably had begun to resent women long before this particular outburst . I had never seen him uncivil to his wife . They had one child , grown up and distant . His wife played a great deal of bridge . He supported her adequately and , as far as I know , uncomplainingly . But sometimes , because he was a thoughtful man , he must have measured his marital satisfaction against its costs and his efforts . Perhaps he even thought of his wife as the fiftieth widow between Barker Street and the old library . He would have been reluctant to criticize her personally . There was nothing about her to criticize . But he could criticize fifty of them ! We are in the middle years of a woman 's generation which was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ desire to be worth something to the world , ambitious to have women of equal stature with the men who were their husbands and companions . The original plan , we must remember , was never to incur the resentment of men . Women felt very sure that such resentment and antagonism as they encountered in their first efforts was the result of shock and would be transient ; they expected that a few years of accomplishment would do away with it . There has been much accomplishment , the best of it unfortunately concentrated in the hands of a comparatively few women , and more than a few years have passed . But the resentment of men has not disappeared . Quietly it has grown and deepened . They are no longer angry as they were in the beginning when women did unaccustomed or conspicuous things . Men love individual women as passionately as they ever have , but in the aggregate they seem to like women less . Young girls , married women , working women , and the widows all come in for a share of this general @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sex feel toward women as a sex . I do not believe that we can Name it on the depression . That indeed has put nerves on edge and produced crises . But women should lay much of the responsibility for any illwill that exists at their own door . We have been willing to discard many of the qualities which made us valuable to men . We have confused earning capacity with social contribution and foolishly believed that one was as good as the other . We have given men much less to count upon than in the past and little more to admire . Most of the things that women have done men could have done and would have done anyway . Women themselves have had a good deal of fun and excitement and created a stir , but they have not added much to the sum of human accomplishment or experience . This is what many men feel and say . Iv What men of maturity think about women is important to know and analyze ; but since their attitude is so often biassed by the cruelty of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with the prejudices of a generation that had to change its habits , their findings must he taken with some salt . But the attitude of boys and young men toward their feminine contemporaries is very important because it is indicative of how we are coming out . Here again we find that wariness which is not a friendly but a defensive sign . It is the watchfulness of those who feel that if they do not keep their eyes open they may be used to their disadvantage , cheated nr exploited . I know a good many boys well . Some are as young as sixteen and some in their early twenties . They are not a homogeneous group . They go to high school , to private academies , to colleges and universities . Some of them already earn a living and others are trying to . I like almost everything about these boys better than their attitude toward girls . I asked the mothers of three boys how they felt on this point and , rather to my consternation , they agreed with me absolutely . I asked @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Those other women , who by the way did not know the same boys I knew , had seen in others what I had seen . There was something cold , hard , and critical in the attitude of the boys toward the girls they knew , except when they fell in love with one . They thought a good deal about girls on the whole . They wanted them about . They shared sports with them , liked to dance with them ; but they had no esteem for them as a sex . " You have to admit , " one boy said to me when we were talking about girls , " that men are better than women . " Now if he had said that men were wiser or stronger or more competent to fight or earn or plow I should have thought it was only a sentence passed on from one generation to another . But he did not say any of those things . He said " better . " As he talked on it was increasingly apparent that was what he meant and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lie thought girls lacked moral quality . He readily granted to the girls he knew other qualities , such as gaiety , charm , beauty , and the ability to give him a good time . But he felt that they were morally insufficient . This is not the historic attitude of men toward women . This is not why they began to lift their hats . It might be argued that the gesture was never more than a formality . But I do not think so . Men used to raise their hats and sweep their plumes to the ground and pull at their caps when they met a woman with something like this in mind ? rather vaguely , to be sure . Women , they thought , are not very clever and they are not very strong physically but some of them are beautiful and the ones we salute arevirtuous . They guard something for us which we often neglect but which we want preserved . Women are far more innocent of evil than men and , though we men certainly would not like to be women or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that they exist to preserve the virtue of the world . So we treat them with tenderness or with gallantry and respect if we can not find it in our hearts to be always tender . Men knew all along that there were plenty of shrews and women of easy virtue ; but still they felt that these were not the majority of women and that they did not represent the true essence of their sex . In the back of their minds , behind their own strayings , defections , boasts , and superiorities , men recognized a special merit in women that was personally precious and socially useful and they saluted it . The boy whom I have mentioned did not feel like that . It was rather worse because he had derived his opinion of women from girls who were still very young , probably most of them under twenty . He expected that girls would make use of him if they could ; that they would tempt him into giving them a good time and into spending money on their amusements . He was very conscious that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ or less erotic , and this quality in them he was prepared both to enjoy and guard against . All this was said or intimated in no bitter spirit , for he was a pleasant young fellow who liked to enjoy himself and keep happy and his philosophy of women was set to dance music so that it was more tuneful than may appear when the lyric is set down by itself . He finally said to cheer me that " I need n't worry because girls could look out for themselves nowadays . " Whether that implied that he was washing his hands of responsibility or paying women a dubious compliment I am still uncertain . Now of course no one wants that young man to be sentimental , or to have a silly attitude of worship for the female sex , or consider it partially pure and partially impure in the old-fashioned way . His frankness was all to the good . But I did not ( and this I take to be serious ) think that he had the basis for fine mental and emotional relationships with women @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the proper basis . Yet that was , as I remember , what feminism was after . So somewhere we must have gone off the track . I have already mentioned the belief held by men of the pre-feminist period that women possessed and guarded a special merit or moral excellence which was of value to men as individuals and to society as a whole . This idea survives here and there among elderly men who are stubborn or confined to a small and old-fashioned circle or who enjoy posturing . It is a thesis revived on Mother 's Day with the help of many florists and many ready-made telegrams , but there is just about a day 's worth of trade in it . It has no real substance any more . Only a few days ago , since the inception of this article , a woman of my acquaintance said to me , " No one seems to believe in morality any more . " A year ago she herself believed in it so firmly that this statement astonished me . I tried to pin her down to analysis @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ could make ? out , chiefly chastity , although she lumped in a few other things with it . She was accepting for herself and her family ( she had a son and daughter in their teens ) a society in which chastity was not considered necessary . She was nervous about the results but was putting up no fight . What interested me was to see that this new belief brought out weakness and not strength in her . This was no stride into freedom for this woman . It only made her seem silly and a little sly . For she was wondering ? one could so easily see this ? if there might not be unforeseen and unimagined sexual opportunity waiting for her too , since it seemed to come the way of so many of her friends . Putting her personal case aside , I think what she said was not true . It has been my own experience that most men whose opinion is of any consequence still believe that morality is necessary to society . Certainly all the great philosophers and scientists contemplated the problems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ do not agree as to what personal virtue may be , but they all feel the necessity of a modicum of order and principle . They may try to seduce individual women or be gratified at the widening of their own opportunities for sexual irregularity , but all the same they do not like the general lack of principle among women . It worries some and angers others . They are realists and do not trust the conduct of the world without it . Departure from principle , men can understand . They should . Change in established practice may or may not annoy them , but they accept it when they must or when they think that the subsequent practice will be an improvement . But that they want , and that was what women promised . We asked for change in the interests of more honorable and upstanding relations between men and women , a more truthful morality and greater social usefulness . We demanded it as a protest against the disparity between the privileges of men and women and between their occupations . At the outset of his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ discusses briefly the difference between drudgery and exploit and the sense of the disparity between men 's work and women 's work in all barbarian communities . Exploit and prowess belonged in such groups to the man , and what Veblen called uneventful diligence was the woman 's part . Centuries and civilizations have made great and proper changes in this disparity . But I think this is true . Men have never relinquished their primary claim on exploit as a function which belonged to their sex . But women , becoming more and more emancipated and sure of new and latent powers , looked with an increasingly jealous eye on man 's possession of the field of exploit . Nobody could blame them for that . They were less and less content with mere diligence in the domestic and , later , in the industrial field and they are not content with it now . However , when it came to entering the field of exploit and concerning themselves with adventure rather than diligence , what did the average woman consider exploit and adventure ? How did she want to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ drudgery , hoping to shake it off , or even vaguely wishing that they could , thought ( as the crow flies ) of emotional adventure . That was natural enough . It was the most exciting field to enter . It was one in which most women felt they had been discriminated against . Besides , they did not think they needed much training . But emotional exploit is very difficult and particularly hard for women . Neither their nervous systems nor their characteristic possessiveness suits them for it . They lack sufficient detachment and sustained fearlessness , and both are necessary for it . A few women ? I myself know only one ? have no doubt been successful in making a fine thing out of emotional adventure . The attempt has only debauched a great many other women . In the meantime , which is ever since , women have been neglecting other fields of exploit . There have been exceptions . Amelia Earhart flew across oceans . Some others tried explorations , excelled in sports , were the first to enter this or that new field . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adventurers attracted no great crowd of disciples or followers . When we are frank about feminism we know that it has been a history of a few women taking advantage of opportunity and of a great many others letting it slip . How much longer that can go on is a question . The resentment of men against women may narrow opportunity still farther . That feeling may be greater or less than I feel it to he , but certainly exists . As it appears in the cool careful attitude of boys toward gills it means that men are increasingly reluctant to do any more for women than women do for them . They may even do less and feel justified . For what men most basically resent , is that women have taken certain definite values out of life and not replaced them or given them anything better . Then what is there ahead for women ? No one who has escaped from domestic drudgery wants to return to it or would return except under a pressure which could be only temporary because of the tremendous force of discontent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to satisfy their eagerness for personal exploit and to divert it from blind alleys of sexual indulgence or even more futile desire ? The question should not be allowed to be merely rhetorical , and the best way to escape from generalization in answer is to be admittedly personal . I myself think that work of almost any sort raised to a pitch of excellence or topped by success can become exploit . It need not be a great matter . For example , I have paid off a note at a bank , and that was a financial exploit for me , even though the sum was small . I have often rewritten a piece of work more than once so as to say exactly what I meant to say , and that sometimes turns out to be a satisfactory intellectual exploit . Once in a while I have managed a personal relationship so that hate was avoided , and again felt that sense of personal prowess which is the reward of exploit . These were all unimportant things to everyone else . It was in the special and , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ feats of skill . The trouble with many women is that they let their imaginations get sluggish . They think that they must have Amelia Earhart 's equipment or Anna Sten 's charm in order to be capable of adventure . They do what is set before them in their houses and in their offices halfheartedly . Their love affairs and marriages are ineptly managed . Yet it does not need to be so . I know a teacher who had almost no income and no money to work with , yet she has established a Children 's Museum which houses extraordinary things , and people come to see it from near and far . I know secretaries , identified to most people only as initials typed in the corners of the letters , whose daily work with their employers is real exploit . It is always a question of excelling , and the woman whose job is her only field of experience may have to get her exploit within it . The holding of a job under present conditions can be exploit too . Then there are public fields . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a vote . Today they have it in this country , in a period when votes are of tremendousconsequence . Politically , women have at the very moment a chance to display real prowess . It means labor and danger and exhaustion and discipline and all the other things that exploit nearly always involves . But there is the opportunity . Politics is particularly the field for exploit of the woman of independent income who will not lose her livelihood or endanger her husband 's job by political action . There are times when the man must be the drudge if he is the wage-earner . He has to stay out of political life . But many women are free ? some of those forty-nine widows for example might take a hand , especially the younger and stronger ones . The other day a woman wrote from Louisiana telling me of her plans there and asking for help . From what I hear about conditions in that State , the women are freer to organize against the Long control ? and safer if they do it ? than the men . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ opposition to Mr. Long would have to be organized by women . And what a field of exploit that would be and apparently is , with a small group of women battling dangerously against a dictator . Of course they must see it through before we can crown them with glory . We have an example of how well that seeing through can be done in the recent action for repeal of prohibition . That was a successful exploit , and women were greatly concerned in it and valuable to the movement . There is even more necessary work ahead . We are certainly going to see vast propaganda for fake schemes in these next few years , schemes of such magnitude that unless they arc met by tremendous persuasions they may sweep away the good sense of a troubled public . There is no reason why women should not make the most of their political recognition now . But they must do what they did for suffrage and later what they did for repeal ? go after an objective with strength and consistency and unswerving purpose . It means working @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submission to training and the slow acquisition of facts and always putting the feat ahead of praise . I do not mean to exaggerate at this point . Every woman can not go in for political exploit . Some of them have no taste for it and others are kept from it , at least for the present , by the necessities of their husbands ' jobs . Where does it leave such women ? We ought not to select a special group for exploit and leave the rest out , for , again going back to the original idea of feminism , what was sought was personal independence for all of them . Many of them have attained as much as they need , but there are still plenty of masculine bullies about , in homes and offices . It will take many personal exploits , a long , long series , to get rid of them . The free field for all women and the universally open one is the matter of attaining and maintaining self-independence . But that means more than kicking up your heels or getting drunk @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ week . If that is all there is to it , it is n't worth the trouble . What personal freedom should mean to all women , sometimes along with other things , sometimes by itself , is that they are at least free to choose their human relationships and handle them with increasing skill . The implication was when we demanded such freedom that we should do that , even more . Twenty years ago women made many fine promises to create new human relationships . They promised finer companionship between the sexes . The wariness of men toward women , their growing contempt and resentment , show us how badly we have kept our word . Those promises remain largely unfulfilled . For that reason there is a magnificent field of exploit here still waiting for women , especially young ones . It is not emotional exploit in the sense earlier mentioned ? not sex adventure alone , though that may be part of it . It is an exploit that if it amounted to enough would restore the moral values that are essential to life , that would @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women could trust . I should like to see girls take on that kind of exploit and succeed . For I should like to see those cautious , skeptical boys raise their hats and mean it .
