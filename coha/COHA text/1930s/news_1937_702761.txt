txt Pioncering days of the labor movement have ended . Organized labor has grown up into a new epoch . New opportunities , problems , dangers arc opening . The labor world is mingling with the public world as never before . Labor has jumped out of hi seclusion , is influencing government , gives promise of expanding greatly and may be reshaped by Its own new elements . The old and the new are grappling within the labor movement . Hundreds of thousands of workers who never belonged to a labor union are joining . They expect great things of the union , but know little of its traditions or how to use it . Thanks to government , workers find artificial obstructions to self-organization abolished . The employer no longer is allowed to fight the union by discharging men , if he chooses , for belonging to it . Millions May Join . As only the core of the workers previously had been unionized , leaders expect millions more will join labor organizations of one kind or another .

I. 0 . contract , accelerated by redoubled endeavors of the American Federation of Labor to retain its leadership and confirmed by the Supreme Court 's approval of the Wagner Labor Act , protedting workers in collective bargaining . This is also the year of the beginning of turmoil . Freshly organized workers are only beginning to learn to adjust themsleves to new relations with employers . Also , many an employer , who hitherto has run his concern without intervention of outside influence , is learning how to get along with the union with which he has signed a contract . promotion of collective bargaining is a true reading of public sentiment  --  the public must attain a better understanding of trade unions . and be patient with their first . steps in newly-organized industry . On the labor side , should legal checks be needed to discourage exuberant ignorance , such as often Ls seen in sit-down strikes , no doubt the legislation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ themselves properly the public doubtless will impose restrictions . In this call for self-discipline. newer unions show signs of lacking leadership . Names of few experienced trade unionists are found on rosters of the big new unions . As early workers see it . their fights and sacrifices brought collective bargaining to its present state of development . It was bought and paid for by countless losses . griefs , frustrations , pinchinga and stintings  --  woes that fell on all the family . Faults Recognized They confess there were grafters among union members , men who sold out their brothers , and there were men who worked first for themselves , and there were disheartening mistakes in Judgment , excesses , and therefore defeats . Yet the larger mass of trade unionists have gone along in good standing and peace , for example the machinists and miners , clothing makers and railroad brotherhoods , blacksmiths and printers . The pioneers had no thought of remaking society . They often worked 12 hours a day and sometimes seven days a week . They wanted shorter hours . Their pay was small @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ were willing to give generously to charity  --  but not for justice . The only solution these laboring men saw was to organize and stand up to the employer , not as a single helpless individual against a powerful company , but as a combine of its workers . " I was fired so many times 30 years ago when trying to organize , " recalls Roy Horn , president of the blacksmiths and drop forgers , " that I had to take an assumed name to get work . Employers put me on the blacklist , and refused me employment . I was married and had my mother to care for . My pay was so small my wife was ashamed to go on the street in the clothes she had . " Now Leader of 30,000 ? Mr. Horn now leads 30,000 members of his craft . Unions in many ways resemble a fraternity . Many members retain membership and pay dues long after dropping active contact with the union . Meanwhile organized labor improved working conditions over the country .

Today the ' worker finds unions ready-made or waiting for him Wages and hours in some instances are better than the world ever has seen . How these things came into being . the new generation of a orkers does not know . Rarely is the worker a student Invention is making him even less ao . In former years . when a man spent years learning a trade . this task and achievement tended to make him more thoughtful . As the mass production of the present saps skill and multiplies monotony , and as factories increase . the host of the unskilled and semi-skilled expands . It is these who now are being introduced to unionism . Melt are joining unions with no more knowledge of them than of the pest day 's weather . Yet a union is more intricate than a watch . Primarily it is a mental knot of human relationships . It involves personalities both of union leader and employer , earnings , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the children a welfare . A Trade in Itself Becoming an intelligent union man is virtually a trade in Itself to be learned after a worker puts on his button . Chiefs of both the A. P. of L. and the C. I. 0 . agree to this . Says one of the latter . " Organization is one thing and unionization another . It takes experience . maybe years , to become a capable trade unionist . " Similarly , a national figure on the A. F. of L. side remarks , " I used to think organization was everything . Now I 've changed . I see that education is more important . " Absence of education , experts assert , is the weakness and danger of all newly organized trade unions . Education in this case means mostly the self-education of how to conduct a union ind deal wisely with employers  --  that is , it means experience . Statistics show workers are being organized into unions so rapidly they are not absorbing a great deal of union education . The major part of the organizing is being @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ for organizing new workers as soon as possible . One is that the willingness of workers to organize goes by waves . One day they may flock in : the next , week , they may have no interest . As a C. I. 0 . organizer observes , " You have to get them when they want to come , and act at that moment . " But can the labor world digest the raw millions ? Training Declared Need " If John L. Lewis would stop right now and train the workers he already has enrolled , it would be the beat thing he could do , " avers an A. P. of L. man who is ardent for the industrial unionism of Mr. Lewis . " But at the rate Lewis is rushing new workers into unions wholesale without union training . he is oftenizing trouble . There will be extravagances and disturbances . The whole C.

Views of a Veteran Of this impetuous force , an InetienUal veteran In the C 1 . 0 e X ? plains : New workers are coming Into unions with enthusiasm . They are impatient . They expect to obtain everything oser night it doe : 41 t work out that way . What the old unions have got , it has taken them years to win It wUl take years for the new unions to make all the progress they look for New unions are apt to be too impetuous .

They will drop out . Later as they realize anew the advantages of the union . they will come back in . Ultimately , as in the older Unions today , members will learn the ways of working with themselves and with employers , and the union still become to them an institution like the schools .
