Fort Saavedra stands in the midst of a muddy plain surrounded by dense woods . It lies not in that part of the Gran Chaco which is in dispute , but in land which until six months ago was recognized as Bolivian . Round that fort for 31 days , 20,000 men have been fighting one of the greatest battles South America has seen for 50 years , in a war that has never been declared . It has been a close fight . The defending Bolivians have more men , heavier artillery , more munitions . The attacking Paraguayans have fresh water and more food-a tremendous advantage in that feverish rain-soaked region-and , as any student of Paraguay 's War of 1864 should remember , they are the fiercest fighters in Latin America . <P> Reporters last week noted tremendous artillery fire . Two Paraguayan attacks were beaten back . A Bolivian plane fought a Paraguayan plane ( no decision ) to the immense enjoyment of ground troops on both sides . Travelers reported boatloads of wounded passing up the Paraguay River to Asuncion . There were @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , war correspondents noted no atrocity stories , possibly because most of the soldiers of both armies are Indians , not quite sure what is an atrocity and what is fair fighting . <P> Away from Fort Saavedra there were abundant signs last week that both countries were heartily sick of their undeclared war . For months an international commission of delegates from the U. S. , Colombia , Cuba , Mexico , Uruguay has been dangling a peace plan before the combatants . Chief point was that each side should retire ten miles , leaving a 20-mi. neutral strip while final peace negotiations went on . Bolivia would not agree to this at first while she was advancing . Paraguay pooh-poohed the idea while she was capturing one jungle fort after another . Last week with both sides stalemated at Fort Saavedra , the 20 mi. of neutral ground seemed like a good idea . If fighting must continue . Bolivia 's chances were brightened last week when General Hans Kundt , onetime officer of the Kaiser 's Imperial Army , reached Peru , returning from exile in Germany and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ troops .
