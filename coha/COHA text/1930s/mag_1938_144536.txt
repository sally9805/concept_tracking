" King by the Grace of God and the Will of the People " is what astute , courageous , popular Vittorio Emanuele III was long before Il Duce added the title of " Emperor . " Last week His Majesty surprised casual foreign observers-not Italians-by making Adolf Hitler 's visit to Italy the occasion for visibly demonstrating that Benito Mussolini is not the whole cheese in Italy-although he is of course The Big Cheese , as Neville Chamberlain is in England . <P> Up to a few weeks before the 1922 March on Rome , Fascist Mussolini was an avowed Republican pledged to upset the Throne , and he came out as a Monarchist in a public speech only a few weeks before the March . Significantly the Fascist marchers on Rome were poorly armed , whereas His Majesty had mobilized powerful army units , held discreetly in barracks and side streets of Rome . Editor Mussolini remained at Milan 400 miles away until after the March , then accepted the telegraphed invitation of Vittorio Emanuele to come to Rome and form " His Majesty 's Government @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it was a Fascist , Marshal de Bono , who went out to begin a " Fascist conquest ' ' of this part of Africa . It was a prominent Monarchist , Marshal Badoglio , who , when the war bogged down under de Bono , was sent out , and ended the war as an " Italian victory . " The King has always acted so as to give fullest scope to the energy and talents of II Duce , who has always acted with the greatest respect for Vittorio Emanuele III . Not long ago a Fascist official told of having suggested on a certain point that the Premier simply ring up the King by telephone , told of Il Duce 's reproving reply : " Such lack of respect is not to be shown His Majesty ! Audience must always be sought in advance . " Last week Italy 's reigning King-Emperor and her ruling Dictator joined in visibly correcting what has become outside Italy a pretty general misconception . <P> Adolf Hitler , who combines in his single person the roles of Chancellor ( Premier ) and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , was met on the station platform in Rome last week by Il Re Vittorio Emanuele and II Duce Benito Mussolini . Der Fuhrer gave the Nazi salute , II Re the military salute and II Duce the Fascist salute ( see p. 23 ) . Afterward the German shook hands with his Italian hosts , and then Premier Mussolini effaced himself , slipping out and driving off in a small car to his office . <P> Meanwhile , the King-Emperor and the Realmleader entered the first of a procession of State victorias . Into the others piled Italian and German statesmen and officers . Then off all clattered , escorted by mounted cuirassiers of the ancient House of Savoy in gleaming breastplates.
