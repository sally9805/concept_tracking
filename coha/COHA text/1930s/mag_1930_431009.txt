IN THE grim struggle we mortals make to create a good impression , it is amaz- - ing how many of us fail to recognize the importance of the voice . We are beauty-mad , culture-mad . We struggle to be attractive with all the zeal with which our Neanderthal ancestors struggled to keep from starving to death . But it is only the exceptional man or woman who realizes how definitely he either attracts or repels his fellow creatures by the very tones of his voice . Our speech is our passport to society , our credential to any group , the infallible index of our cultivation ; it is the telltale sign that marks our air of gentility as genuine or assumed . Yet the average individual is so indifferent to his voice he does n't even bother to listen to it . Just as we are blind to our faults , so we are deaf to the sounds we utter . Only by a conscious effort can any one hear his own voice . " The day I can make a pupil hear his own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ famous voice expert . The first step in voice culture is voice consciousness . Listen to your voice . Is it pleasant ? Is it music to the ear ? Consider the voice of your favorite actress , of the most popular radio announcer , of some friend whose voice stands out in your mind as being particularly agreeable ; what is the one trait they all have in common ? A distinctly musical quality . Speech at its best is spoken song . What music lies in Walter Hampden 's voice when he reads Shakespearean lines ! Why did thousands listen entranced to Sarah Bernhardt when they could n't understand t0 a word of French ? Her spoken words were like a song . Nor is this strange for speech and song are almost interchangeable . A speech tone and a song tone are made in exactly the same way . There is only one technical difference between the spoken word and the singing one ; namely , in song the tone is prolonged , fixed in time and pitch by the notes of the score . In speech this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mood of the speaker . The trained singer should speak beautifully ; the person with a habitually pleasant speaking voice , should learn to sing with little effort . An American woman who had gained local reputation as a singer went to Europe to study with a famous master . But at her first words of greeting on entering his studio , the master raised his hands in horror . " I will not take you as a pupil unless you begin all over again , " he cried . " But you have n't heard me sing ! " she protested . " I do n't need to . I have heard you speak . " How may one acquire a musical speaking voice ? By learning to play correctly on his voice instrument . Nature gives everyone at birth a vocal organ which normally is adequate for the production of a beautiful tone . It is up to him to learn to use it . What must he do to make his tones melodious rather than strident or harsh ? First , he must learn to breathe deeply and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made . Behind the full , rich , vibrant - tone lies plenty of , breath well controlled . A thin , weak voice means lack of breath . Second , he must let that breath come through a relaxed , open throat . This is one of the most difficult problems with which singer or speaker must cope . " Open , open , open your throat ! " is the constant cry of the voice teacher . Anything which tends to close the throat makes the voice raucous and grating . The innumerable complaints hurled against the much lamented American voice are due in some measure to unfavorable influences of climate and temperament to which we as a nation are prey . Cold contracts the muscles of the throat ; the sudden changes and extremities of our climate play havoc with the voice instrument . The tropical climates favor the voice . The throat of the nervous person is tight ; his voice is tense and high-pitched . Nerves are a chronic American disease . The high pressure under which we live and our severe climatic conditions are national handicaps @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice both by his easy-going temperament and the sunny clime from which he hails . The farther north we go , the more closed the throat . Who ever heard of a singing  | Eskimo ? The Nordic races have produced fewer great singers than the Latins . Occasionally from the land of the midnight sun comes a peerless star like Jenny Lind , but for every lone star that blazes out of the North , the South shows a full constellation . Every one in Italy sings , even the children on the streets . The American singer is continually working against fundamental handicaps . But not only the throat must be kept open to achieve this melodious tone . The nasal passages , too , must be unobstructed and free so that the air comes singing , humming through them . Failure to speak through an open nose is responsible for our most prevalent fault the great American nasal twang . " Americans talk through their noses ! " is a universal complaint . But the real fault is just the contrary . We do n't talk through our @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ use the nasal passages that gives us that much advertised nasal twang . It is quite ' impossible to talk intelligibly unless the nose plays some part in the process . Hold your nose and try to say something . All speech is obstructed and blurred . Without the nose the sounds of M and N simply can not be made , for they are nasal consonants . Did you ever try to say " Spring has come " when you had a cold ? With nasal membranes swollen and air passages obstructed we get a thick , dull " Spr'g has cub . " Nor will the missing M and N return until the cold has gone . Do n't fool yourself ; talk through your nose . It is one of the purposes for which God gave it to you . It is the breadth and ample space of his nasal passages that help make the negro 's voice so beautifully melodious . This breadth is visible in his facial contour . The air comes singing through these broad , free , open chambers and gives the humming quality @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Mawnin ' , suit ! " there is music in the words . To cultivate this in your own voice , practice humming . Humming forces you to use your nose , and as you listen carefully you grow conscious of the tones which should pervade your speech . Almost every voice teacher gives the great AHM exercise . Here it is ; try it and give yourself a voice lesson : Open your mouth wide ? wider still ; take a deep breath and start to yawn ; this opens the throat . But do n't finish that yawn . Instead sing out a full , round " AH . " Prolong it for a second or two , then close the mouth , letting the breath continue through the nose to make the M sound . Practise your AHM 'S ? daily , hourly . Make them resound like the tones of a bell . The more resonance you can put into them , the more beauty and color they have . Try to make this same beauty and color audible in your speaking voice . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and an open nose that is pleasant to hear . But the art of the spoken word involves more than tone . It involves the shaping of that tone into definite word patterns . This shaping process necessitates a kind of linguistic gymnastics in which most of us are woefully unskilled . It means deft and accurate use of tongue , lips , teeth and jaw . To pronounce the monosyllabic word " go , " one must put his tongue , his lips , his jaw into a G position and transfer them quickly to an 0 position . The process is so instantaneous the speaker is scarcely aware of the two separate movements that compose it , but unless each movement is accurate , it gives blurred or slovenly speech . To change the " go " to " going , " the shaping process is continued through three additional quick movements that give the syllable ing . If the final g is not finished but dies carelessly on the lips , we have the alltoo-prevalent goin ' , the sign of the slovenly tongue . Many an American @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ' and huntin ' , simply because he is too lazy to shape the final consonant . Speech formation is an exacting process . It means diligent watching not only of your P 's and Q 's , but also of your G 's and T 's . The word is kept , not kep ' ; it is something , not sump 'm . It is not " W'atcha gona do ' bout ut ? " but " What are you going to do about it ? " In cultivated speech each vowel and consonant must be given its proper value . There are no such words in the English language as w'ich , w'at , w'h and w'en . Put an H in them and they become respectable , a credit to any tongue . It is a mark of good taste and breeding to have all your letters with you , even if you are only waitin ' and dressin ' or eatin ' punkin pie . By such unpardonable corruptions we have defiled the English language . However energetic we may be in other respects , America @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way in which we form our words and careless of the tone in which we utter them . Cultivated speech is a twofold problem , pleasant tone and correct enunciation . The negro has tone . His melodious voice is music to the ear , but he makes no effort to enunciate . He mars his speech by blurring his words . He says , " Ah du n no , " and " How ah yuh ? " shapes his vowels with flagrant inaccuracy , slides carelessly over his consonants , now and then omits whole syllables . His speech may have its own native charm , but it is not cultivated . The proverbial New E n g l a n d school-teacher errs in the other direction . She has good enunciation , but too often lacks tone . She clips her words with  | too pronounced an effort to be correct , but usually she utters them in a thin and restricted tone . Cultivated speech is a combination of rich , vibrant , melodious tone and the correctly enunciated word . Both are essential . With @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they can be acquired . We can train our voices as we train our bodies , by exercise and proper attention , and correct our speech as we correct our table manners , by noting prevalent faults . The beautiful voice of the actor is the result of years of training . Henry Irving overcame a serious speech impediment . Benjamin Franklin freed himself of a provincial dialect and was distinguished even in courts of Europe for his cultivated speech . Imitation plays the largest part in determining how we talk . We speak like those among whom we were born and with whom we associate . The best schooling is habitual contact with those who speak correctly . A pleasant voice is contagious ; so is an unpleasant one . A similar manner of speaking runs through a family , a community , an entire section . The child born in the shadow of the Harvard campus will speak with a Cambridge accent ; in the Middle West he will burr his R 's ; in the cotton country he will blur them . Nor will he depart from these @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , or until he himself makes a conscious effort to change them . And how loath we all are to change our speech ! Few habits are more deeply ingrained than speech peculiarities . We cling to them as we cling to family traditions ; they are the last thing we choose to renounce , even though we know they are incorrect , perhaps frankly unpleasant . How the Southerner loves his drawl ; how the New Englander prides himself on his precise speech ; how the Middle Westerner likes his vigorous R 's ! Rarely are we even conscious of a provincial dialect . When it is brought to our attention , we are immediately on the defensive . " But it 's natural for me to talk that way ! If I spoke differently , I should seem affected . " Man is never so prone to follow the herd as in his linguistic habits . It is not an affectation to improve our dress , to groom our mental  |                   @ @
