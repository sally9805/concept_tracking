txt The British destroyer Westminster has returned to port after having burned oil successfully during an experimental voyage  --  not ordinary fuel oil , but oil made by British chemists from British coal . Now , it is said , the Admiralty has contracted for a twelve months ' supply . This is another step in England 's effort to become independent of petroleum-producing countries . If there are to be more wars the seriousness of her position is obvious . Naval and merchant vessels now burn oil rather than coal . Oil is not one of England 's natural resources . Coal is . Ever since Professor BEEGIUs demonstrated the possibility of converting coal into oil , gasoline and similar products , British Government research bureaus and private companies have been actively engaged in developing hydrogenation processes . What these are is easily grasped when we remember that all fuels are essentially combinations of hydrogen and carbon . In oil there is more hydrogen and less oxygen than in coal . We have but to juggle the proportions of carbon , hydrogen and oxygen to turn coal @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ paste of powdered coal and obtains either synthetic petroleum or synthetic gasoline , to mention but two products . Oil is also left as a residue in the process of low-temperature carbonizing coal in the manufacture of gas , and from this tar oil a first-class gasoline can be won . What the character of the Westminster 's oil may have been we are not told . Whether it came from the gas retort or whether it was produced by hydrogenation , the question of cost is paramount . From a recent discussion of the subject by competent men in the correspondence columns of The London Times , and from a careful analysis in The Nineteenth Century by Sir RICHARD REDMAYNE , an authority on coal and gas , it is evident that without a tariff , synthetic petroleum and gasoline , whether produced in Germany or Great Britain , have no chance against their natural competitors . True , tar oil , left after carbonization , costs no more than imported petroleum , but there remains the semi-coke to dispose of at a higher price than ordinary coal . Gasoline @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ refinery gasoline which has been laid down in London at 2% pence , although the present price is twice as great . Evidently the present tariff of 8 pence is necessary if England must free herself at all costs from the American or Rumanian refinery . To Sir RICHARD the solution lies in following the American practice of prohibiting the burning of soft coal in the larger towns , so that semi-coke or anthracite must perforce be purchased , and also in levying a duty on all gasoline which is imported or made from imported petroleum . The London Times suggests an alliance between the Government and a private firm , possibly Imperial Chemical Industries , which has already spent upward of E1,000,000 in perfecting the Bergius process . This means a subsidy . But subsidies are nothing new in Great Britain . In the last year for which statistics are available the State supported the beet-sugar Industry to the extent of ? 6,000,000 . Whatever policy may be adopted , there is a strong conviction that imported fuel may not be available when the British Navy and British merchant ships @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
