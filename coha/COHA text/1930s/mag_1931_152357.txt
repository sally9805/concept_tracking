Tomorrow and Tomorrow . A new <P> play by Philip Barry is always an event . His latest is a solemn , psychoanalytical excursion into a midwest university town , demonstrating that Main Street has as many civilized perplexities as Park Avenue . It has to do with the appearance of a distinguished Canadian doctor ( Herbert Marshall ) at the university as a summer lecturer . He resides at the home of a childless , exquisite , subtly dissatisfied young matron ( Zita Johann ) . He perceives that she is " an artist without an art , " and , more particularly , a woman without a child . He recommends that she adopt one . But they become lovers and , when the doctor leaves for a pilgrimage to Europe , his hostess is pregnant . <P> Several years later the child surfers a psychological disturbance , vague and terrifying , traceable to the misguided influence of the lady 's husband ( Harvey Stephens ) , who has always imagined himself to be the father . She then recalls her savant-lover , now more eminent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's psychosis . The problem arises as to whether the lovers shall enlighten the cuckold and depart with their son . But much is manifestly owing to this man , who worships the child as his own . Therefore the doctor departs again on his lonely , scientific wanderings . <P> Another attempt to probe the imponderable , the play is more satisfying than Mr. Barry 's Hotel Universe of last year . This time he has successfully endowed his characters with enough character to make them convincing individuals and their dilemmas real and anguished . He has done it tenderly and surely , more surely than Eugene O'Neill in the similar explorations of Strange Interlude . The play is excellently acted . Osgood Perkins , late of The Front Page and Uncle Vanya , gives a memorable bit as the hardboiled but far from insensitive secretary of the doctor . Critics who have seen all of Mr. Barry 's plays tend to pronounce Tomorrow and Tomorrow his best . <P> Philip Goes Forth from his father 's $5,000,000 business to New York to write a play and eventually finds out @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he wanted to . That is what this play proves with much dull harangue . It was written by George Kelly ( Craig 's Wife , The Torch Bearers , The Show-Off ) . Here he presents a lodging-house collection of sad artistes mothered by a landlady who was once a great actress . They are mildly droll , mildly tragic , but Playwright Kelly could be accused of conceit in supposing that he has made them worth the price of admission . <P> Anatol. written in 1893 , was Dr. Arthur Schnitzler 's first play , an ironic , sentimental chronicle of love in Vienna . Though it breathes of pre-War matinee-idolatry ( John Barrymore played Granville-Barker 's able translation of it in 1912 ) , it has yet some durable qualities- wit , grace , ebullience . Viennese Joseph Schildkraut plays Anatol unevenly , not always bringing him to life . Offstage waltzes by Johann Strauss gave the play authentic Alt Wien atmosphere , which , is almost all it needs . The " plot " is merely , a half-dozen amorous episodes . unconnected except by the busy @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ subtle and wistful as a lady who might have loved Anatol but never dared . Blonde Miriam Hopkins is raucously amusing as a guzzling showgirl.
