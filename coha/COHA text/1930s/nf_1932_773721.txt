txt WHAT WE LIVE BY heavenly bodies were made of a special substance , infinitely finer than the four elements , which he called quintessence or fifth essence . But the spectroscope leaves us under no such poetic delusions : the stars are made of the bodies familiar to us here below and might be used to manufacture our kitchen utensils . " " Well then , what is the essence of those bodies ? What is matter ? " " Have you ever seen Crookes ' tubes ? Seen Nature naked , atomic , swift at work , With fiery sparks fluorescent on her path ? ' " " Yes , I have seen those tubes . It is an experience one does not forget . " " And have you seen a nebula in the telescope ? " " Certainly , and I also see that you are going to tell me about protons , electrons and waves , scattered matter and so forth . Introduce gyration and the primitive nebula will become a vast sphere out of which the stars will be blown , ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ like small soap-bubbles out of a larger one . " " No , I will not introduce gyration . It is too much of a problem to understand how it ever introduced itself . And I will not get enthusiastic over electrons , even if I am told that , like angels , they can move from one spot to another and never be found at any intermediary point . Clearly those mathematical revelations are at the same time too abstract and yet too easily mistaken for perfectly simple and intelligible statements , to be for me . But there is one thing in them which seems to force itself upon the mind and stay there . " // " The hopelessness of getting at any clear notion of the matter ? " " No , I would rather be positive than negative . I mean the speed with which matter now travels from its former definition . Do you remember what is the Greek for matter ? " " Oh ! as Moliere 's character exclaims , ? ' For the sake of Greek do , sir , let me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ remember . " " Well it is ule , which also meant wood . The Greeks selected the deadest , most inert thing at hand to represent what they thought matter must be . To-day , we are told that matter properly investigated appears to be nothing but electricity , and electricity travels seven times round the earth in a second . The notion of matter evidently tends to become less and less material . " " Which no less evidently does not tend to result in a definition . " " Who knows ? This is a time of reconstruction and the work is barely started . However , if inorganic matter is so far from what it was supposed to be , do n't you think that organic matter , life , will be even farther ? " " Yes , of course , but do not scientists say that there , too , electricity is the ultimate manifestation ? " " The ultimate manifestation of living cells , perhaps , but not of what makes them alive , not of Life . Surely that is quite apart from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " You say surely ' , but what is certain in the philosophy of physics ? Has not the theory of hormones changed the whole outlook of biology ? " " It has , but I do not think it reasonable to build // on uncertain possibilities . If science is certain of one thing it is of its own uncertainty . " " I state of mind far superior to the unfounded certainties of Fundamentalists , you will admit . " " Yes , but science at times is pretty cocksure . Remember Haeckel . And as his name comes to mind let me ask you what I think is the all-important question . Do you believe , as Haeckel and his many followers did , that with hydrogen , azote and carbon , a living cell can be reproduced in the laboratory ? " " I do not believe it , but I do not disbelieve it either . To be frank I see no impossibility in it . " " Remember that the laboratory has long produced fats which , at first sight , are indistinguishable from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ more than a perfect automaton would be a man . Life , mysterious life , is not in them and can not be forced or coaxed into them any more than the aerial swallow can be wished into the canary 's cage . Biologists arc not sanguine just now . " " I was only talking logical possibility . You must admit that some day , through some now inconceivable piece of luck , a living cell may be produced at the Rockefeller Institute and kept alive by the Carrels of the day till parts of it can be distributed among the great laboratories all over the world . " " Infinitely doubtful . But suppose this truly living cell is created and Promethean biologists from all over the world watch it in its crystal cradle , do you think they could develop it into even an amoeba ? " " No , for some reason , my mind refuses to admit that possibility . " " Therefore there is even less possibility to see it // develop into an ammonite of any size , and gradually pass through all the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " No chance whatever . " " Now remember what took place , most undoubtedly took place , on our earth . One day , untold ions ago , the living cell appeared , and now , you and I , its descendants , are having this conversation in which we show ourselves to be the intellectual lords of the world , taking our data from innumerable sources and using them with incredible swiftness . Billions of species , other than our own , have been evolved from the original cell , but have been arrested in their mental development . We know there is no chance for even the most intelligent apes , whereas our own chances for comprehension and mastery seem indefinite . All this marvellous human development was latent in the original cell . Consciousness , sensibility , vision , reason , were latent in it . All that has to be summed up in the world in the great word Mind has been developing at the same time as Life . Finally ideals have become clear and imperious , and the higher levels have been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ religion . Is it not evident that , as electricity is superior to dead matter , life superior to atoms , and mind superior to life , there must have been at work in the world something superior to even Mind and that something has been guiding all the development we see ? " " I can not see how we can conclude differently , unless we fall back on Kant 's criticism or on Hume 's singular effect . " " Hume 's singular effect ' works in two ways . It can make us distrust our reason , of course , but on // the other hand , it can open marvellous possibilities . Astronomers tell us that about a hundred thousand stellar systems seem to be in the same stage as ours , with planets similar to Venus or Mars . Why not remember , with Voltaire , that an ape in another world might be a Newton , while a Newton might conversely be an ape ? " " Painful to think of , but true . " " Painful ! I call that possibility marvellous . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ which Newtons would be the mob ! Imagine what its real Newtons must be ! Marvellous , I tell you . Glorious and enchanting ! And somehow we can not help imagining that it must be so . Yet , matter is the same in all the universes we can see , and therefore the spiritual element which works under it must be the same that we see at work on our earth . Only its manifestations are , or must be , superior to all we know or can imagine . " " That is indeed a great vision , and a great idea , and surely a great , certainty . " " I knew that , in time , you must see it that way . Needless to ask you what is the name of the spiritual element we bow to the moment we glimpse the glory of its manifestations . " " No name is adequate . There is none but is not desperately inadequate . God is the Ineffable. " // Aristotle 's treatises on supra-sensible causes were placed by the Scholiasts immediately after the philosopher @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they were called metaphysics ( meta , after ) . But the same name can also designate all knowledge superior to physics , so that its modern acceptation is entirely legitimate . Metaphysics is the science which begins to speak when physics has to be silent . We have just seen that the consideration of the Universe in its entirety has led us to a spiritual element which in the universe we call God while in ourselves it is called Mind or the Soul . Metaphysics deals with that double spiritual aspect of material appearances . I. GOD i . Existence of God IF WE were told that the beauty of the forest , its poetry , its eeriness , all that we love in it is the work of a beneficent Spirit hidden in its silence or flying on its breezes , we should love the notion . Perhaps we would endeavor to establish a communication with this Spirit . The idea of God acts in the same way on the philosopher 's mind . The more he learns about the wonders of creation , the deeper he gets into @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in a word , his notion of God 's works becomes , the more glowing also grows his intellectual happiness . Read Plato or Augustine , read even those cooler logicians , Aristotle or Aquinas . Why is it then that the existence of God is questioned by some thinkers , and is angrily , savagely denied by thousands of men ? The explanation of this strange anomaly is given not by philosophy , but by history . The tradition that Fear created the gods , that primitive man read the existence of the Divinity in plagues rather than in blessings , is still alive and resented . So is the kindred recollection of priestly power . Ecclesiasticism , many people declare , is still with us : not a week passes without some effort on its part to rule even conjugal life in the name of the deity . God has been WHAT WE LIVE BY used , through the ages , by his priests . The more independent people have become economically , the more resolute they have grown to use their independence as they pleased . This @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our civilization offers at every step , is what is called modern paganism . The expression is faulty , of course , seeing that the pagans were , as Paul called them on the sacred hill of Athens , " all too fearful of the gods " , but the wrong word is trying to denote an obvious thing . What this thing is anybody can see : it is the deification of pleasure . Many people who still call themselves Christians are really pagans insofar as they have two gods : one represented by their Church whom they fear and would hate if they dared , the other , Pleasure , whom they adore , or in whom they adore themselves . But people who resent clericalism or deify pleasure do not , for all that , publicly deny God . This is reserved for people often of a powerfully and rather grossly emotional nature , whose logic is easily affected by their sentiments . Such people have been known , time and time again , to deny God either because they were suffering , or because the suffering of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the notion of an all-powerful , all-merciful Being with the actual presence of Evil . All they have heard in Christian churches about the goodness of God suddenly seems to them to be a cruel mockery or a brazen lie , and they blaspheme . " Yes , I remember Swinburne 's verses in Atalanta : // None hath beheld Him , none ! Seen above other gods and shapes of things , Swift without feet and flying without wings , Intolerable , not clad with death or life , Insatiable , not known of night or day , The lord of love and loathing and of strife Who gives a star and takes a sun away .... The supreme Evil , God ! ' " " A strange admixture of force and feebleness . Why did you skip the four or five last verses ? " " Because I do not remember them . Ind I do not remember them because , as you say , they are feeble and declamatory . Shelley , in Prometheus , would be better , but I have not read Prometheus for years . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ about requiting knee-prayers with hecatombs of hearts or hecatombs of hopes which sounds more like the real thing . The idea is always the same . God is a tyrant abusing his strength to crush creatures purposely made weak so that they can easily be crushed . God is Evil . But those poetic effusions are not so strong as they are violent : it is only because they are exceptional in literature ? not in life ? that people quote them with bated breath . " " Do n't you think that the problem of Evil is a real problem ? " " The most difficult of problems ! but I do not think it expresses itself in literature . It is mostly felt with its full force by people who shake their heads and never say a word . " " That 's the way I felt yesterday seeing two boatmen near the Pont-au-Double trying to revive a // drowned man they had just pulled ashore . This was an old man with a pinched face and , even in death , a pitiful expression . Imagine the misery @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to see the noon of a beautiful day in May . But this is one incident in a thousand . Shelley is right . Hecatombs of hopes . When the idea comes to mind the brain becomes as numbed as the heart . " " Only too true . If we could see the amount of wretchedness , moral as well as physical , which each minute produces , the suffering of man and animal , the disappointments , the treasons , the deceit and the corruption , the multiform cruelty to young and old , even to small children , the failure of noble attempts , the relapse into hated habits , the constant defeat , in a word , by Evil of what we call God , not only our faith in theism would be shattered but our minds would not stand the shock . If evil were not hidden like impure germs disseminated in our system , there would not be a single sane person on earth . " " You just said that God is constantly defeated by Evil . Does not this amount to an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! merely an admission that there are mysteries . This one is the most oppressive because its background is misery , human misery . You must have read many times that science is supremely pessimistic as the end it foresees for the universe is destruction perhaps followed by more efforts resulting in more catastrophes , but probably this prospect does not affect you as ten minutes in a cancer hospital would be sure to do . " " It does not because somehow I imagine that by that time things will be righted . Infinite prospects // are only blanks and there is no terror in them . But how do you reconcile yourself to the mystery of evil ? " " By thinking of the mystery of Good ! One should never be polemical about anything serious , above all about anything religious . But suppose you are attacked , by one of the few scoffers left , on this very question of the existence of God being disproved by the prevalence of evil , you can silence him at once ? not of course persuade him ? by asking @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no God . " " You mean that the same arguments which have led us to the conclusion that there must be a spiritual other side to the world can be used again about this issue ? " " I mean that if matter can result in spirit , if its selfishness can naturally be transmuted into disinterestedness , if the play of atoms can in time produce the life of Christ , plus can be said to come out of minus , and our reason is a mirage . The whole thing can be said in two words , but it can also provide material for a life-long meditation . " " I see , in fact , that Materialists have used up whole existences in trying to imagine plus coming out of minus . Jnd I know that , more and more , Science gets away from the simplicity of mechanicism . But are there no arguments against the existence of God except the existence of evil ? " " There are . Nobody has set them forth with more vigor than Kant , and you can read @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Pure Reason . It is not easy to answer it . " " Well then ? " " Well , Kant himself was not affected by them ! // Nobody can have believed in God more wholeheartedly than he did . " " How ? " " He knew that his criticisms were only philosopher 's philosophy . His own belief , like Newman 's , had a deeper root than mere reasoning . To him belief in God and belief in the moral law were one thing . This means that he , too , could not solve the mystery of Good without bowing to a divine fountain of goodness . " " Yes , does not Kant say also that we will the existence of God more than we infer it ? " " He does . But which of our human beliefs , ? I mean truly human beliefs , not logical convictions , ? is not a choice ? Scrutinize your own soul , scan your principles , you will find that love , preference , inclination are at work under your apparently purely intellectual conclusions . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ faith . The final assent comes from the impulse of the will . If theologians could express their generally excellent psychology in the language of literature they would be more convincing than they are . Newman 's Grammar of Jssent has a terrible title , but it is convincing psychology expressed in the most beautiful language . Read the book . " " I will . " 52 z . Nature of the Divine Being " If I understood rightly what you said about the existence of God , the Divine Being ought to be defined as an explanation of the universe . " " The explanation of the Universe would be better , but it would still imply that God might be a mere intellectual necessity , a concept like Space or Time . God is the spiritual element without which the Universe could neither exist nor be understood . " " Is that what most people think God is ? " " Of course not . Most people means , I suppose , the majority of people . Now you know that the majority of people have a very @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adequate idea of God ? " " Nobody . Even a genius on one of those globes where a Newton would seem an ape would have no adequate idea of God . The measure of perfection can not be seized in its entirety by anything that is not perfect . " " Does this mean that no sacred book , not even the Bible , can give us an adequate idea of God ? " " How could they ? Is not the human language full of limitations ? Even Sunday School children now-adays make their own inward reservations when they hear that God walked in the garden in the cool of the day , ordered massacres , or had bears devour children who had made fun of an old prophet . The most uneducated readers of the Bible realize that // the notion of the Divine Being is purer in Isaiah than in judges , and purer again in the New Testament . " " Yes . I know that all this is felt even when it is not actually expressed . But should we infer that the notion of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of its ethical or devotional implications the notion of God is intellectual and , as such , is better grasped as the human mind becomes more capable of grasping it . Many people object to that view because they either imagine that it detracts from the sovereignty of God or insist that God , being the God of all , must be equally understood by all . " " There is something pretty appealing in this . " " No doubt . Belittling anybody 's God is cruel and criminal . But the sacred name is charged with a heavy heredity . Remember that it is still written by millions of people with a small letter , and the Hebrews often saw only a difference of power , not of nature , between their Iahve and the Baal of their neighbors . So it is not surprising that the word God should share in the destinies of all words and be partly understood by a few men , misunderstood by most . " " I once read that Diderot would say to the people of his day : Enlarge your God @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ your notion of God . " " Yes , but living just before Goethe , the most modern of moderns , he was deeply impressed by the astronomical discoveries and his idea probably was : let there be no geocentrism or judeocentrism in your notion of God when our Universe has just been made so vast that we can not conceive its limits . It is a fact that the larger the effect the larger the cause // must seem to us . The final word should be : let there be as little anthropomorphism as possible in our notion of God , eliminate from it what is of man , that is to say material , and bring it as near as possible to the notion of pure Spirit . " " What is a Spirit ? " " I was awaiting this question rather anxiously . Luckily you asked it in the proper subdued tone and not in the confident way of people who either imagine that there can be no answer or that the answer must be the simplest thing in the world . You realize that , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nature and yet write queer commentaries on Revelation , a definition by the partly material of the purely spiritual is an impossibility . All we can do is to say what a spirit is not . And the best we can do is to go on wondering what a spirit really is . " " Can we say much more than that a spirit is not material ? " " That means that a spirit is not bounded as we are by the two great tyrannical categories : Space and Time . All we see is limited by space and all we do , nay , all we are , is limited by time . If there were not so much joy in getting at the truth , even the unpleasant truth , the thought of our imprisonment in space and time would be unbearable . A pure Spirit , God , all the time sees the whole picture of which we only see fragments . The Universe , even the endless succession of universes which astronomy has sometimes inferred from the conservation of energy , is present to Him as @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is present to us . Have you noticed that even everyday parlance prefers to say that God sees everything rather than that He knows every- // thing ? To know implies the action of the memory which refers to the past and is a poor makeshift for constant and direct vision . It is remarkable that the common language should be so accurate whereas the popular notions of God are gross . " " Is there no possibility of a relatively pure , almost mathematical , notion of God apart from philosophy ? If so , is it not a pretty discouraging idea ? " " Keep emotionalism out of such questions , if you want to get anywhere . But you know that mystics have seldom been mathematicians or metaphysicians . In most cases they are simple people endowed with an extraordinary gift . They invariably surprise the professional philosopher by the sublimity of their conception of God . Therefore it is not true to say that , apart from high intellectualism , men are condemned to an inferior notion of the Spirit . Contemplation , the interior life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of us , and , in all of us , it can produce its marvellous effects . " " Contemplation , as you seem to understand it , is a religious act , is it not ? It is an effort , as spiritual writers often put it strangely , to see God face to face . Now is n't that anthropomorphism with a vengeance ? What can the face of a spirit be ? On the ' other hand , if you try to get away from anthropomorphism you are promptly compelled to admit that a spirit can not be a person . J person is a person because of differences , is he not ? Now , a spirit occupying no de finite point , showing no limitations , no characteristics , can not be differentiated . Therefore God is not a person as we conceive a person to be . " " Excellently put ! God is not a person as we con- // ceive a person to be . But should the next step be that God is not a person at all , that He is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ dissolve God through the Universe that it is as if there were no God . " " Precisely . Now , admire once more what words can do , how the least absentmindedness in analyzing their meaning can lead us away from the truth . Do you think it logical to say that since God is not a person , as we conceive an ordinary person to be , He is impersonal ? What is the usual meaning of the word impersonal ? " " Indefinite . " " Indefinite to the point of being non-existent , you mean ? " " Perhaps not quite so much as that . Indefinite to the point of not being to be bothered about . " " Exactly . Indefinite to the point of being severely let alone . Some day 1 we shall inquire into the tendency many people show to regard the loss of God as if it were a marvellous gain . Just now what I want to say is that it is illogical to conclude that , since God is not a person as we conceive a person to be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is no question of religion here , mind you , only of logic . Which do you think has more personality : Shakespeare or Pinero ? " " .4sk the theatre fireman . " " Yet , is it not true that Pinero occupies a more definite point of literary space than Shakespeare ? " See Part III , section B , Chap . II . // Are not his characteristics more easily described because they are more restricted ? " " They are . You can give any foreigner an idea of Pinero 's work in two minutes , whereas it takes hours and great talent to characterize Shakespeare . The simpler the object is , the simpler its description is likely to be . " " Would you also say : the smaller the man is the more personal he should be ? " " Have I been absurd anywhere ? " " You have been unguarded in your use of the word personal , that 's all . The less limited we are , or the less we feel the pressure of environment and heredity , in short @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our father or like the people in our town , the more personal we are . Now , ex hypothesi , God does not feel the pressure of the Universe in the remotest manner . Multiply Shakespeare by the infinite and you will have some faint human idea of the personality of God . Have you ever read in any textbook that Aristotle defines God as pure act , actus purus ? " " Dozens of times . But it is one of those scholasticisms from which I run away in terror . " " , 4ctus purus , a scholasticism ! Blasphemy , blasphemy ! 4ctus purus is not a formula . To me it is a sort of gem in which I see more fascinatingly human things than have ever been conjured into four syllables by any Oriental enchanter . And do not doubt that Aristotle saw those things too : the divine , the divinely happy , condition of a Being who never can wish for anything because all the time He enjoys everything . Imagine an artist whose inspiration was ceaseless and continuously followed by realization . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at his best . All we can do to form an idea of God 's personality should be in that direction , removing limitations all the time . That is prayer and that is adoration ! " " I will never blaspheme against aetus purus any more . I had no idea that poetry could be extracted out of a Latin formula . " " Formulas , apparently abstract formulas , in a dead language , are apt to seem metallic and lifeless . Look at them long enough to see what the inventor thought and saw before he finally condensed the contemplation of a life-time in their syllables and suddenly you will discover that they are sesames to enchanted halls . What do you say now about the personality of God ? " " That our own personality is a remote reflection , an in finitely weak copy of it . " " Yes , but expect millions of people to go on imagining that , if God is personal , He must be a not exactly lovable old person with a beard . Aged words , superannuated associations , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ deceive us in such matters . " 59 It is a common saying that a little knowledge takes man away from his belief in God but deeper knowledge brings him back to it . And some wit once remarked that when this happened it was not the same God that was believed in . Nothing flippant can ever be absolutely true and the present saying is no exception . However keen the pleasure which irreverence may find in the mention of two gods there can only be one God . Human conceptions vary with individuals . Folly , levity or stupidity produce ridiculous notions ; thought and the passion for truth seldom fail to get their reward . In no case more strikingly than in the quest after God . II . THE Soul . " Soul " is one of those many words which , in the course of their eventful existence , have not been able to preserve their identity . To modern ears the soul is rather the vital principle keeping organic matter together than the higher faculties enabling us to reason and organize . Nobody ever speaks @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to describe the highest kind of poetry accurately . So , when we refer to our most intellectual apprehension we now prefer the words mind or consciousness . However " soul possesses such a rich heritage of allusion , it has been clad in such a rainbow scarf of poetry since Psyche made her entrance into the world of imaginative reason , that it is difficult and it does not seem desirable to avoid it . Keep it out of the problems of immateriality , immortality or free will , and mankind will feel impoverished and cheated . i . Immateriality of the Soul The materiality or immateriality of the soul has been discussed for three thousand years . Democritus and Epicurus could not conceive of anything that was not reducible to atoms . So , to them , the soul was an aggregate of infinitesimals . Consequently it was not different from the rest of the material universe . This reasoning would be cogent if it did not beg the question . Also , to us moderns , if it did not conflict with the recent atomic theories showing us @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ instead of appearing as small shot , are now waves of energy . This applies to the brain even more than to chemical bodies . Nobody is prepared to state that mental operations are performed apart from the brain , but , on the other hand , few people now-a-days dare to say that thought is exclusively produced by modifications in the gray matter . The behaviorist who tells you that thought is only an inward sort of speech may be as affirmative as he pleases , he is not convincing . Materialism ? or to give it its elegant new names , mechanism or naturalism ? is not in favor with contemporary scientists . Its chief support has been taken away from it . " How then do philosophers who prefer the opposite doctrine think of the spirituality of the soul ? " // " Did I notice a certain ring in your question ? You remember , do you not , that , as Pascal says in discussing this very issue , there is no zeal here of spiritual devotion ? " " Often is , though , especially @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that , if the soul is declared to be spiritual , the next step will be to threaten us with hell or coax us into heaven . " " It may be the fault of the zealous ecclesiastics , but it may also be the poor logic of their interlocutors . At all events , we are trying to approach philosophy philosophically . Your question was : what is the philosophical foundation for a belief in the spirituality of the soul . My answer is this : i. modern physics sees energy everywhere in the world ; 2. biology sees something more spiritual than mere energy in life ; 3. philosophy can hardly help seeing something even more spiritual than life in Mind , the supreme achievement of nature . " " But is it not everlastingly true that , if you destroy the brain , you also destroy the mind ? " " What of that ? Destroy matter you destroy energy or , at all events , its visibility . If the universe were destroyed there would not be a trace left of the miracle of evolution . The @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ world . But if you say that the world is energy or the brain is mind , you beg the question . " " This means that you leave to Materialists the burden of proving that the soul is not immaterial . " " If you like , although I hate even the appearance of tactics in such an issue as this . What I mean is // that , if I can not see spirit at work in my mind as I see it at work in the universe , I am left with my note of interrogation and the materialist alone stands before me with his unshaken certainty . All he has to give me is his everlasting : There is only matter in the world indefatigably repeated , although physicists shake their incredulous heads . " " So you would rather be with the physicists who have some arguments on their side than with the materialists who have only their belief ? " " Beautifully put . Final . Yes , materialism seems to me to be a faith . " 64 2 . Immortality " But is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the sixteenth century , was in hot water for saying so . You can read the story in Bayle 's dictionary : three lines of not very interesting text at the top of the page , column after column of exciting notes just below , and the margins full of references . Great work . There you will see how Pornponazzi , finding that Aristotle believed the soul to be corporeal , pointed out to his Aristotelian betes noires that their belief in immortality could only be based on the authority of the Church . " " I am surprised . I thought Aristotle was always on the side of the angels . But is it not true that immortality and religion are interdependent ? " " The ancient Hebrews did not think so . You have to travel through a good deal of Biblical literature before you can be sure that the authors had no doubts about a future life . " " Yet , surely belief in immortality is connected with belief in God ? " " Ah ! that is much better put than that religion is @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ God without believing in immortality , but it is hard to see how anybody can believe in immortality and not believe in God . Have you read Plato 's Dialogues on the subject ? " " Oh ! just Pha:do , and so long ago .... " // " Well , the main idea is that , unless the soul has time , in another life , to be purified of its sins , Evil is victorious over Good , or , as we should say , the Devil is victorious over God . " " Simple , convincing , and terse . I love a reasoning of that kind . " " Then you will also like the parallel doctrine developed by the Neo-Platonists . " " You mean Plotinus ? " " Plotinus and Porphyry both lay great stress on what they call anagage , the ascent of the soul towards its Maker . No life is long enough , or favorable enough , to make this ascent possible for any of us . The conclusion is obvious . " " Can we not say too that , if @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in vain , ? a hideous thought , ? while injustice is not redressed , which sounds immoral ? Is this philosophy , or is it mere sentiment ? " " It must be philosophy , for it is exactly Rant 's second postulate . Treat it as mere sentiment and the philosopher 's system will be in great danger of collapse . " " Now , let me be frankly sentimental . Unless I can think that animal suffering , the long martyrdom of so many poor creatures can not be in vain either , my idea of God is obscured by the same objections which the vision of any kind of injustice raises . " " The cartesian view of animals as machines , and the modern so-called scientific view that man 's life is so precious that other lives may be remorselessly sacrificed to it , appear to me equally laughable . So I am strongly inclined to think that if annihilation seems to us good enough for animals it is largely on // account of our exaggerated appreciation of ourselves . However , remember ? in order @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the present : they never think , as we do , of the suffering in store for them , above all they are spared the torture familiar to man , the clear vision of death . " " Perhaps . Yet the resignation of animals is sad , inexpressibly touching and sad . " " So is that of many men and women who know what real misery is . Wherever we look we encounter an earth where suffering outweighs happiness , and where perfection is only intelligible to us as the negation of endless imperfection . The same divine influence which we see at work in what we can guess of the past can not stop now . Once more remember the days in the Tertiary Age when there was not a single thought produced on our globe . Then contrast that vacuum with our civilization and knowledge . Why not imagine that even more extraordinary steps onward will be made in the coming ages ? Surely nothing can be more philosophical than to supplement our philosophy with the hope of future knowledge . Immortality , which to Cicero was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , seems a necessity to Kant , and its demonstration may be perfect long before another two thousand years have elapsed . " // RIGHT AND WRONG THE origin and the foundation of morals have always been discussed . " Why do you say : this is wrong ? " is an old question . But ethical issues have never been discussed as hotly as they are now . Look at the bookseller 's windows . Philosophy proper , prehistory and sociology all handle and rehandle the hows and wherefores of morals in a hundred ways . " You know the main currents of opinion , of course . " " I know that many people rebuild morals on the old utilitarian foundation but call it sociological . I am told that if I slay not it is because I dread to be slain in my turn ; I do not steal lest the custom of thieving should extend to my own property ; I do not lie because I hate to be deceived myself . All I do that I call right is , in that way , shown to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , as well as the summary , of morals are declared to be expressed in the perfectly philistine saying : honesty is the best policy . " " Do n't you think that , ignoble as this view of the origin of morals sounds , there is a great deal of truth in it ? " " Why , it is undeniable . All the time we catch ourselves doing right because it is advantageous . But it is not the whole explanation . I admit that I // feel the pressure of social necessities at a great many points . But a thing may be at the same time right and advisable , wrong and inexpedient . The simultaneity proves nothing . It is certainly not because I am afraid of the effects of drunkenness that I take my wine with moderation . Nor is it merely because I might make a fool of myself . It is because I should be ashamed of myself . " " Is not that egotistical too , in a certain sense ? It is in our interest that we should not be ashamed @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ my interest to lose my life by trying to save a drowning child , or by fighting for my country , or by volunteering for a dangerous scientific experiment . Where can my interest in such actions be ? They undoubtedly could never be done were it not for a conviction , somehow acquired , that principles are more important than even life . " " Are n't you afraid that these so-called principles may be more or less reducible to some superior form of egotism , the craving for admiration , for instance ? The athlete is admired for his prowess , the warrior is admired for his bravery ; in that way a tradition sustained by poetry and by the arts is created . In time it seems better , opinion actually declares it is better , to risk or even lose one 's life than forfeit admiration . " " Probably that is true . But is not this kind of egotism superior to the egotism which consists in saving one 's skin at all costs ? " " It is superior in our view . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ admiration supposes a scale of values . We give marks to actions , and the lower values go to the lower egotism . " " What makes us do that ? " VERUM-THE TRUE " Ah ! what does ? Do you remember what we said about Evolution culminating in Mind ? " " That such a miracle could not happen if there were not a spiritual principle in the world ? ... " " Precisely . In the same way there could be no scale of values in our reason if we did not possess a spiritual light showing us what is higher and what is lower . Kant and Newman build their belief in God on the existence of that light . All the time God , or the Spirit , wants us to rise above Matter constantly dragging us down . Morals is , according to the language which people adopt , either the supreme stage of evolution , or the voice of God speaking to our conscience . " " Do I need to believe in free will if I am to believe in morals ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will can not be discussed as if it were a little side issue ; you recall to me Madame de Stael asking Fichte to explain his philosophy to her while he sipped his coffee . Free Will ! Do you still know what we are discussing and how far we have gone in our discussion ? " " I think I do . Man has been looking at the Universe , now he is looking at himself . He has found that he is spiritual , or partly so , and he hopes he is immortal ; now he wants to hear whether or not he is morally free , for all we have found about morals will he useless if free will is a delusion . " " Marvellous ! You certainly do know what we are talking about and that is no mean achievement when the topics are something else than mere business or trivial arrangements for the day . " " It all depends upon how interesting one finds a // discussion . I am keenly interested in free will . I have always been . Here 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't he ? " " Go ahead ! " " Easy enough . The case for determinism is as clear as daylight . My soul being associated with its body , that is to say matter , is limited by its material prison , of course . With a certain brow a man is intelligent , with a receding forehead he is stupid . Even if he is intelligent , he can not be brilliant when he has a headache . So he is limited , predetermined by his material part . Now , just as my soul is limited by my bodily conditions , my activity is limited by the Universe in which I am plunged , is it not ? " " Unquestionably . You are terse and luminous . " " Easy enough , I tell you . When the day is too warm , I feel limp , body and soul ; if it is wintry , I am numbed and unhappy . The universe about me , my surroundings have to be favorable . If I am poor and live on an out-of-the-way farm in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ am well off , in New York or Boston , college will be at hand , refined company will be the natural thing : I shall be an educated , travelled person and my clever talk will delight the fortunate people who will move in my sphere . " " Was Lincoln a rich young New Yorker ? " " No , he was not , but he was an Iowan genius . What he lost in environment was made up for by what he possessed in his own right . The same with Shakespeare . A man is first the result of his individual components , material as well as spiritual , and , second , he is the result of circumstances which he can not control . Therefore , he is determined on all // sides . If he were not ? listen to this ? he would be God . " " Do you like the idea of being imprisoned like that ? " " No , but I like logic and I would rather be uncomfortable than foolish . " " Heroic . But perhaps you need @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ such iron determinism as that which your logic describes . " " Can you , are you free , to model like Michelangelo or write like Milton ? " " I might answer like the man who , being asked if he could play the violin , replied he had never tried and therefore could not tell . But a Scot 's answer may give more food to your logic . Here it is : could not Milton have written Paradise Lost as poorly as he wrote Paradise Regained ? Milton was not always at his best ; the Penseroso , for instance , could be written by many a versifying sophomore . " " You mean that if I have a dollar I am free to spend only five cents , but I doubt if that applies to a poet . When Milton 's inspiration was strong it produced Paradise Lost ; when it was feeble Paradise Regained turned out feeble . Conditions , as usual , determined the result , and it might have been predicted in advance . " " Do you know what you are doing all @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " The very reverse . I speak of free will and you think of capacity . Nothing can be more illogical . A plain case of ignoratio elenchi . My freedom is not limited by my capacity . I can not swim a hundred miles or , like nimble Attila , jump eight horses , but if I could , probably I would . If I make three thou- // sand a year I can not live as if I were making ten 1 thousand , but I do not feel my liberty limited by my capacity . If I have two hundred dollars left I can spend them on a trip to Canada or on a set of the Britannica , as I please . " " You think you can . " " I am not sure of that , but if I think I can I do not feel hampered in my action , do I ? " " 4re n't we hair-splitting ? " " You certainly are . You may even be quibbling . Let us be talking honest psychology . Have n't you been @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place in your soul under the influence of your own thoughts ? " I " Wanting to live upstairs , as you call it , instead of downstairs ? Why ! yes ! I want to do good even when I do evil , and that fight will go on as long as I am not delivered out of the body of this death . It 's my environment , flesh and world , that weighs me down . But my mind dictates differently and I am sorry or ashamed when I disobey its orders . " " Ah ! here is the crux . In the first place our mind dictates differently from our flesh . Do you think that that could go on endlessly , as it does , if we never had our choice ? Do you think that , through the thousands of years of his existence on earth , man could have been a mere toy , a puppet , and yet retain that exalted idea of good compared with evil , of nobility compared with mediocrity ? Surely if this ideal were only a mirage @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ by solid facts . " " I admit that . I know that if I tell a reformed drunkard that his free will is only a dream , and if I // " What convinces you , then ? " " What you said about the survival of my inner light in a world which ought to have extinguished it long ago : that is convincing . " " You feel , do n't you , that the same Spirit , at work in the Universe , is also working in our Mind and Will . The still small voice is His . " " Yes , if I had absolutely no choice I should never know shame or remorse . " " You put it in a nutshell . Morals is built on that certainty . And if it failed us , the world would be uninhabitable , for appetites would rule it while beauty would desert it . " " I am glad you see Morals as a source of beauty . The word moral is not absolutely fascinating to modern ears . " " I know . It @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long had a red nose , and delivers itself of platitudes through it . But , for all that , morals is not preaching , it is beauty of a rare kind . What the world has produced that has a right to the names of nobility or distinction is summed up as moral beauty . Really great men , benefactors ? not rulers ? of mankind , wise or sublimely kind men and women , give us the impression of beauty far more than many artists can . They are the connecting link between the lovers of abstract truth and the lovers of beautiful expression . " // THESE are the chief problems of philosophy . In such a brief summary as the foregoing they can only be listed , but their mere enumeration may be enough to start the reader on a course of meditation as long as his life . Some of these problems ? for instance , the discussion of our cognitive possibilities ? are frankly technical and , although all philosophers have faced them , they may be left to professionals . On the contrary , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ practicality . It only takes a moment 's reflection to feel sure that a person who believes in free will and responsibility is less likely to become a criminal than another person who has no such certainty . Most questions studied by philosophy , however , are neither purely technical nor obviously connected with our everyday life : they are speculative . Many people will be inclined to call them unpractical ; but what is speculative is not necessarily useless in daily life . The discussion of the nature of matter at first sight is entirely speculative , interesting only to the physicist or the metaphysician . Yet , by one of its aspects it influences our belief or disbelief in the existence of God . Again the discussion of the existence of God , which , to most of us , brought up in a more or less religious atmosphere , appears as so vital , may seem speculative to a man who has grown // up in unreligious surroundings : to him God is only an explanation of the universe . The thinking of most people is limited to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ life . Whatever is outside that circle they are inclined to brand as superfluous . The figures and data of geology and palxontology strike them as fanciful and of no earthly use . It will never cross their minds , when they see an apple and a pear on their table , to ask themselves at what stage of evolution these fruits had a common ancestor . The very notion of transformism seems to them unreal and uncomfortable . They banish it from their thoughts . Yet it is precisely the meditation upon the great speculative questions concerning man and the universe which , of its own nature , produces culture . We read half a page of a book , we listen for two minutes to a speech , it is enough to enable us to say whether the person who writes or speaks has that peculiar turn of mind or not . Culture is intellectual sympathy ; mere practical pursuits , even of an intellectual character , can never produce it . But wherever it exists , we know we are on the higher levels . No man has @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mind without the reflection of such thoughts appearing on his face in the nobility of his expression . Anxiety about those great issues is the evidence of the presence of God in us . No man who is conscious of it and acts in consequence can ever be low , or even trivial , or ordinary : the divine spark once active in him will not let him be a prey again to his material nature . That is why philosophy , really worth the name , is not a specialty like philology . It should not be // studied in what is generally regarded as a purely scientific spirit . Above all it should never be studied that we may brag about our acquaintance with it . The True should be sought for its own sake . Sometimes , during our quest , we shall be conscious of being in a semi-poetic , semi-devotional condition . That is the perfect philosophical mood . Its effect is at once to elevate us and make our intellectual faculties superior to themselves . But what matters is the altitude which we feel we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
