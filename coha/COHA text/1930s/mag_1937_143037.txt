CLAUDE-Genevieve Fauconnier-Mac- , millan ( $2.50 ) . <P> When a French author is looking for a thoroughly sombre background he is apt to pick that part of France-better known as the provinces-which is not Paris . Claude starts off with as much gloomy naturalism as the drabbest of them , and for the first 50 pages a normally cheerful reader may turn up his coat collar , wish it would stop raining . But if he perseveres beyond this chilling introduction he will soon feel such warming rays as will make his coat unnecessary . By book 's end he will have been acclimatized to the varied weather of a whole human day . <P> The story opens with a double funeral in the little French town of Javrezac . Mme Gerfaut has died in childbirth ; Mme Devereux 's longed-for infant son also . Because the two families are old friends and because one has a plethora of daughters , the other of sons .

Three months after she married Ernest the World War took him , deposited him in a German prison camp for four years . The Russian Revolution swept away her dowry savings , invested in Russian bonds . When peace came and Ernest was released , things looked brighter ; then the post-War slump and a series of bad harvests put them hopelessly behind . It was no longer a question of buying the family chateau but of saving their own roof and patching the leaks . <P> Philippe , tired of gallivanting about the world , came to spend a holiday near the farm . Claude was glad to have him there but they had little to say to each other but " Do you remember- ?
