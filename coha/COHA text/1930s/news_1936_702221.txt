One was yesterdays word from Paris that the government will pay the City of Soissons 6 ' , dollar bonds . due next Saturday . on the basis of the old gold dollar rate .

Traders also are keeping an eye on the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland 5,2s which come due next February 1 . Current litigation in the British courts regarding the gold clause in these bonds has aroused considerable speculative activity ; a few days ago the bonds were quoted only a few points above par , while in yesterday 's trading they were as high as 121 , , bid , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of Lords decides that the bonds arc payable in the equivalent of gold it means that they still have a wide margin for capital appreciation between now and February 1 . next . Not Believed to Affect Other Bonds Foreign bond men expressed the belief yesterday that the ruling regarding the City of Soissons 6s did not necessarily extend to other French bonds , government or corporate . Except for this maturity and a small maturity next April -- $2.110.000 French Republic 3,2s ? there are no maturities for several years to come . The Soissons bonds are outstanding to the amount of $5,806,000 and are secured by a. pledge of annuities payable to the city by the French Government from 1922 , their year of issue , down to this year . The wording of the contract is described by bond men as somewhat different than that in the case of other French bonds and consequently possibly subject to a different interpretation .

The appeal was from a decision of Justice Branson of the Kings Bench Court dismissing the petition concerning interpretation of the gold clause in these bonds .

The bonds were suspended from trading on the New York Stock Exchange last Spring when the British Government failed to file for permanent registration under the Securities and Exchange Act . The Appeal Court 's action also is of interest to holders of Australian and other British colony securities payable in United States currency because they , too , might be affected by the ruling of the House of Lords . Other French bonds closed higher in yesterday 's session on the New York Stock Exchange .      @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
