Last week the Tennessee Valley Authority , in humbler mood than usual , bobbed up before the House Military Affairs Committee to ask for a few additional small favors . Two years ago Congress gave the New Deal everything it wanted just for the joy of giving . Now Federal agencies like NRA , AAA or TVA are lucky to get grudging crusts on Capitol Hill . Thus it was no great surprise when an ungenerous House Committee last week turned and snarled at TVA 's requests for several amendments to its basic act . One amendment would increase TVA 's right to issue bonds , guaranteed in principal and interest by the U. S. , from $50,000,000 to $100,000,000 . Another would enable it to get around Federal Judge Grubb of Birmingham , Ala. who had ruled that TVA 's authorization to sell surplus power did not give it the right to go into the general business of selling electricity and electrical appliances ( TIME , March 4 ) . <P> To start things off before the House Committee , Arthur V. Davis , board chairman of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ tale of TVA ethics : <P> Aluminum Co. , planning to build a plant on the Little Tennessee River ( tributary of the Tennessee ) , had begun buying a power site . When 80% of the land for a reservoir had been acquired , TVA stepped in , bought two small tracts for " national park purposes , " one of a few acres , the other 30 ft. by 50 ft . For the more minuscule parcel of land TVA paid $150 ( compared to $4 or $5 paid by Aluminum Co. for similar land nearby ) but it was worth it , for Aluminum Co. could not legally flood two " national parks . " <P> " I do n't know , " said Mr. Davis mildly , " what they have in mind , but I assume they want to get in a good trading position . " <P> Dr. Arthur E. Morgan , teacherish chairman of TVA , called by the committee , explained : " We bought the land so we could come into their plans and work out with them a unified program . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rather than work in conflict with them . " <P> Representative Numa Francois Montet of Thibodaux , La. did not like that explanation . Said he : " That 's what the land shark does . . . . " <P> But a much bigger explaining job for Dr. Morgan and friends was an official TVA audit prepared by the one man who has power to pry into all the books and accounts of every New Deal agency- Comptroller General John Raymond McCarl . His job is as nearly politics-proof as can be , for only Congress can remove him during his 15-year term and he is not eligible for reappointment. * And it was a notable show of independence for Mr. McCarl to be critical of TVA , for the soft-spoken Comptroller General with his flowing Windsor tie was once secretary , close friend and political follower of TVA 's best patron . Senator George William Norris of Nebraska .
