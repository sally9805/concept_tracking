PASSION 'S PROGRESS : Volume Two , MEN OF GOOD WILL-Jules Remains-Knopf ( $2.50 ) . <P> Ambitious Jules Remains is working on a scheme as big as Honor de Balzac 's . His slowly growing super-novel , Men of Good Will , is being built to specifications to contain a whole city - 20th Century Paris . Goggling onlookers , seeing the size of the completed foundations , may now have some idea of the extent of the building , but Architect Romains , though he admits his construction will cover a lot of ground , still refuses to post his blueprints or release a front elevation . Before putting down tools for this section he thanks spectators for their patient interest , promises that from now on the stories will go faster . <P> Readers of the first volume ( TIME , June 5 ) will have only a slight advantage over newcomers . The 65 characters have grown to more than 100 but their relationships remain comparatively simple . In many cases they are still unaware that they inhabit the same city-book . Some of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Normal College , whose friendship with the brilliant Jallez grows more intimate , is beginning to get used to Paris . Murderer Quinette , falling more &; more under the fascination of crime , tenders his services to the police as informer , worms his way into the secret councils of a radical society . Politician Gurau allows himself to be persuaded by Oilman Sammcaud that being given control of a newspaper is not bribery . His mistress , Germaine , gets further entangled in the market . Realtor Haverkamp begins to get his finger in some real pies . The liberals at Sampeyre 's salon talk gloomily of impending war . <P> Men of Good Will might have stirred up more excitement among critics if Authors James Joyce , John Dos Passos et al . had not already shown the way . Though Author Romains claims to be the originator of this style of modern novel-architecture , others were certainly first in the field . But if not best or first of its kind , Men of Good Will may yet be biggest .       @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
