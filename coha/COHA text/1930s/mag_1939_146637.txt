Eleven months ago the down-at-heels Boston Transcript was pushed into bankruptcy by its creditors . Trustee Elias Field found a trouble-shooter in a lank , stoop-shouldered Harvardman named Richard Newhall Johnson , who looks like Jimmy Roosevelt ( and hates it ) and who had devoted himself since graduation to reorganizing broken down companies and putting them on their feet . Trouble-shooter Johnson had a survey made , from which he found that the most frequent word used by advertisers to describe the paper was " fuddy-duddy . " He also found that the Transcript 's 30,000 readers were astonishingly loyal . By last March he had got the Transcript 's creditors to take one-third of a new stock issue , at 20 on the dollar , in payment for their claims , raised $200,000 from 23 new stockholders , of whom he himself was the largest . By last April Trouble-shooter Johnson was in control of the Transcript . <P> Last week Publisher Johnson gave a banquet for 300 businessmen at The Copley-Plaza , followed by such a promotion campaign as Boston newspaperdom has never known . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speakers and an airplane sign-trailer all shouted the news of the Transcript 's " Newscope Edition . " Two days later , when the Newscope Edition appeared , Beacon Street saw , instead of the Transcript 's dowdy old front page , a bold , five-column layout , of which nearly two columns were pictures . The text frankly aped TIME 'S news treatment . <P> So many other U. S. newspapers , including the Richmond Times-Dispatch , the San Francisco Chronicle and many a lesser sheet , have borrowed from TIME that the Transcript 's new format was scarcely news . But news it is that Publisher Johnson has upped national advertising revenue by 50% , roped 24 new advertisers into long-term contracts .
