ARMY &; NAVY <P> A customs collector in Davao , main town of Mindanao Island , reported last week that a number of unidentified vessels had anchored in Davao Gulf-unidentified because the nearest U. S. naval base with cutters or airplanes capable of investigating was on Manila Bay , 600 miles away . Wildly diverse reports filtered through to Manila , disagreeing as to the size and number of ships , never as to their nationality . This was because there are in Davao more than 20,000 prosperous Japanese , who control the Philippine hemp industry , own 63,800 acres under legal leases , even more illegally . At week 's end , three Philippine Army planes flew from Manila , scouted the Davao area . Most correspondents concluded from official silence that nobody could find a war fleet , that the jittery customs officer had seen either some harmless tankers or fishing boats , or an equally harmless yellow mirage.
