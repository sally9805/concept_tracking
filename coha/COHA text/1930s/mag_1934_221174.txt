Having heard from all interested U. S. colleges &; universities , FERAdministrator Harry Hopkins last week announced the terms and amount of the college cut of Federal relief funds for this year . Amount was $1,414,940 per month . It will go to 94,331 students in 1,466 institutions . Each college will receive $15 per month per student up to 12% of its enrollment . It must certify that aided students could not otherwise be in college . A student must do useful work around campus or community , may thereby earn up to $20 per month . <P> Big University of California had the most needy students-1,898 . Princeton put itself down for aid to 275 . Columbia listed 595 ; University of Wisconsin , 884 ; University of Minnesota , 1,158 . Harvard turned the Government 's offer down flat . Richest university in the land , it needed no Federal handout . Yale 's conscience stuck at the required guarantee that each student aided would have to quit college unless the relief funds were given him . Explained Dean Clarence Whittlesey Mendell : " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a dishonest statement . " <P> At small , aristocratic Williams , new President Tyler Dennett made his first big news in office by accompanying his refusal of aid with a thoroughgoing attack on the whole program . His arguments were the standard ones against government relief in any form : 1 ) It helps the unfit to survive . ' ' What appears to be needed is not more college graduates but fewer and better ones . " 2 ) By accepting aid in an emergency , colleges will be demoralized into permanent dependence on the Government . " I therefore regard this procedure as little less than deplorable . I think it would be much better to request that colleges readjust themselves at once to a new economic situation , pare their budgets accordingly and go on a reduced enrollment basis .
