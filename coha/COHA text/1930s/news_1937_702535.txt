txt Announcing his coming retirement to his own constituents in Bewdley , Worcestershire , today , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin warned the nation of " strange creeds which today are rushing around the world . " He declared : " Whatever fascism and communism may produce for Russia , Italy and Germany , I want to warn you that they can never do anything to help Britain solve her constitutional problems . " They are exotic and alien to this country . You can not graft them on to our system any more than you can graft a Siberian crabapple to an oak . " I do n't think there is any single thing more important for our people , for those who frame public opinion and for those who lead public opinion , than to keep our people immune from the virus of either communism or fascism . " Mr. Baldwin told how the con-1 tinued burden of his office at almost threescore and ten was a very heavy one . He will be 70 years old Aug. 3 and is expected to surrender the Prime Ministership @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ immediately after the coronation festivities . First Reference By Him It was the first public reference Mr. Baldwin - had made to his impending retirement , although most of his colleagues have already paid tribute to " the greatest Prime Minister since Disraeli " and to " the one man above all others who could have held his head and dignity during the abdication crisis . " Mr. Baldwin laughed today when he recalled to his audience of fruit farmers how as a young politician he had heard the veteran Asquith speak of the " intolerable burden " of his office and had thought it " humbug . " " Where the Prime Minister is head of the government , leader of a party and leader of the House of Commons , " he continued , " it is beyond Human strength to carry on the task many years past the age which I have now reached . " While I believe my judgment to be as good ? if it has been good ? as it has ever been , I am conscious that my vitality is to a certain extent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ will have to choose another member . " It might be possible , Mr. Baldwin explained , for a Prime Minister to continue longer at his post were he able to have long holidays , be seconded for twelve months or sit in the House of Lords . But none of these things was possible . " We have under our system to take things as they are , " he continued . " And no one but the man who - bears the burden is qualified to know that it will be better for him to ask permission to hand it to some one else than to go on . " By The Associated Press . WORCESTER , England , April 10 . ? Addressing his constituents in Bewdley today , Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin minced no words in warning against Britain 's adoption of " ideas alien to the ideas which we hold in this country .

" " I do n't think this country Is in danger of having a mess @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ let us , in our happy-go-lucky way , think that such a thing can not come to Great Britain . " Citing the vast speed-up In transportation since he was first elected to the House of Commons as an example of the changing times , Mr. Baldwin said : " Today you may drive with safety on . roads sixty miles an hour . But if this country ever tries to travel in a constitutional change at sixty miles an hour , the Constitution will be wrecked , and it will be wrecked , as it always has been in these rapid changes ? in disaster and bloodshed . " Speaking of his coming retirement , Mr. Baldwin declared : " It is far better to go when the people may still think of you as perhaps not incompetent than to stay until perhaps they know before you do that you are becoming incompetent .
