Last week President Hoover paused in the midst of his labors for the national welfare to attend to his own political pepticity . From an abusive communication directed at him by his lone opponent for his party 's Presidential nomination , onetime Senator Joseph Irwin France of Maryland , who bitterly proclaimed that President Hoover had caught him " off guard " by registering late in Maryland primary , thus winning the State 's 16 convention votes , President Hoover could draw amusement rather than chagrin . If the President needed any further confirmation of his inevitable renomination at Chicago next fortnight , it came last week from Texas where 49 more Hoover-pledged delegates brought his total assured votes to 621-43 more than required . <P> Iowa 's Senator Dickinson , temporary convention chairman , was to make the keynote address and Joseph L. Scott , Los Angeles lawyer , was selected to place California 's Herbert Hoover in nomination . Lawyer Scott was not selected casually . He is a Roman Catholic charitarian who received Notre Dame 's Laetare medal in 1918 . He seconded the nomination @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Boys ' Week , " grey-haired with colossally beetling black eyebrows , he says : " Just a plain homespun American , that 's how my friends know me . From the sidewalks of New York , too , for I have carried the hod in New York City back in 1890 for 20 an hour . And in Massachusetts I worked in the paper mills for 12 an hour . " New York and Massachusetts , with strong Roman Catholic , sidewalk votes , are States doubtful for Hoover . <P> But President Hoover 's chief concern last week was not with people who would be at the convention . He suddenly had cause for worry about someone who said he would not be there . Idaho 's ursine and eloquent Senator William Edgar Borah , ever independent , ever eager to make his independence felt , announced that he would not go to Chicago . His reason was his distrust of his party 's attitude on Prohibition . <P> For the past two weeks President Hoover , egged on by his Wet political strategist Postmaster General Walter Folger @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in public sentiment , had been toying with the idea of a platform plank on Prohibition less Dry than last time . Such a plank , according to word from the White House last week , would be a miracle of political delicacy- " a safe &; sane declaration on the controversial question which would not go so far as to drive away fair-minded Drys from the party in November . " Indicated was some sort of promise for a popular referendum on Prohibition. * <P> With grizzled Senator Borah sulking in his tent , the spectre of a Third Party momentarilv loomed . No man has been talked of more often than Senator Borah as the possible leader for such a movement . Only the week before he had ominously remarked : " I can not conceive of the two old parties going to their conventions without any program to take care of the unemployment situation . . . . If anything would call a third party into existence , or a political revolution , that would . " Prohibition added to Unemployment would , if embodied in planks of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ approaching Senator Borah 's , constitute a wedge sure to split the G.O.P. vote beyond repair next November .
