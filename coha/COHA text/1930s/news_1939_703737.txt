txt Another Isthmian Canal Mr. Eliot 's Arguments for a Nicaraguan Route Are Disputed To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The subject of the Nicaragua Canal is seldom mentioned in your columns without causing a discussion . However , the statements made by George Fielding Eliot in your issue of Dec. 25 certainly call for comment . Mr. Eliot wrote : " This will be a sealevel canal save for a possible single set of locks west of Lake Nicaragua . " A question might be asked . If one goes upstairs , how can he again reach his previous level without going downstairs ? The present level of Lake Nicaragua and summit level of a lock canal is in the neighborhood of 100 or 110 feet above sea level . If a sea-level canal is made of that , Mr. Eliot 's " steaming across Lake Nicaragua at fifteen knots " will be pure fancy . Another point : even at present levels deep-water steaming in the lake along the canal line is possible only for about forty , miles . At sea level @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ suggested by Mr. Eliot . The San Juan River at present in its natural state is about one hundred miles long . With a fall of 100-110 feet from the lake , a slope of about a foot per mile is quite a stream for battleships to go " steaming up and down at ten knots . " If , in addition , it be known that . this fall is precipitous at three or four locations where rapids obstruct the flow , the battleships will be practically out of water . In this we must presume the use of the river and lake as near as possible in their present state , for Mr. Eliot projects only " a possible single set of locks west of Lake Nicaragua . " Should Mr. Eliot be thinking of a real sea-level canal , that would be just a mere ditch forty feet deep at sea ' level for battleships . to say nothing of sufficient widths for turning and passing , all the way across the isthmus of Nicaragua . This distance will be nearly 175 miles , for then there will @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " No wish to detract from the basic discussion of national defense is here intended . There can be little contention of whether our eggs in two baskets of canals would be better than one . The military and naval authorities will face the problem of which is best and most economical : a navy for each ocean or another canal if enemies in both oceans threaten simultaneously . L. E. SEEMAN . Columbus . Ohio . Dec. 30. 1938 . Invisible ' Glass Not New Action df Oxidized Photographic Lens Noted as Early as 1892 To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The invisible glass described in THE TIMES of Dec. 27 by Dr. Katharine B. Blodgett is not by any means new . In 1892 an English optical engineer , H. Dennis Taylor , noticed that a badly oxidized photographic lens possessed a greater speed than a newly polished one of the same type and aperture and discovered that while the lenses showed very little reflection , the amount of light transmitted was increased . He experimented and published his results in 1896 . In 1915 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and found some solutions which increased the transparency of optical glass plates to almost 98 per cent , thus losing through reflection only about 2 per cent instead of 9 per cent to 11 per cent , which untreated glass surfaces would lose . I described and demonstrated my results at a meeting of the Illuminating Engineers Society , in the transactions of which they will be found published in 1916 . Later on Dr. Frederick E. Wright of the Carnegie Institute conducted a series of experiments along the same lines , the results of which can be found in the government publication " The Manufacture of Optical Glass and of Optical Systems , " published as Ordnance Department Document No. 2037 in May , 1921 . As stated in your article , the appearance of a piece of treated glass , side by side with an untreated one , is quite striking . When laid upon a wooden desk the grain is plainly visible through the treated glass , while from untreated glass nothing but reflection of the incident daylight is visible . In The Journal of the Optical Society @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ be found by Dr. John Strong of the California Institute of Technology describing similar work . F. KOLLMORGEN . Brooklyn , Dec. 28 , 1938 . Trials of an Opera Lover He Hopes That Eventually Other Patrons ' Will Be Considerate To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : Yesterday afternoon I listened to " Siegfried " at the Metropolitan . It was a magnificent performance , but some of its grandest moments were ruined for me by people near my seat . There were the inevitable late corners , people who assumed the management meant 1:55 and not 1:45 as announced . In front of me two women shared one pair of opera glasses . Along toward the third act I had become quite expert in guessing to the split second the moment when one woman would transfer the glasses to the other . Diagonally in front was a woman who seemed to require frequent and audible use of several handkerchiefs . It was an exquisite Zeit motif supplement to the forest music . Diagonally behind sat a man who coughed repeatedly . During the dragon scene , had @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ resembled a cough and had its player been seized with a sudden heart attack , the coughing gentleman could have taken his place and without the instrument . Next to me sat a feminine personification of restlessness . I never knew before how many shifts in position could be made by one person in one hour . To cap the climax , In that superb . scene when Bruennhilde awakens to the glorious music Wagner has given us and rises majestically from her couch beneath the tree , a woman behind me said to her companion : " She is stretching herself after her long sleep . " I did not remain to sep whether the coughing man or the restless woman or the stretch commentator applauded the loudest or the longest for the curtain calls . Let us hope that some day somebody will devise a plan whereby it will be possible to hear opera without being disturbed by late corners , coughers , handkerchief-users , opera glass sharers and others who seem to have so little consideration for their adjacent listeners . WILLIAM B. LIPPHARD . Yonkers , N. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Funds Residents Object to High Costs With Denial of Suffrage To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : An article by Delbert Clark with a Washington date line , in THE NEW YORK TIMES Magazine of Dec. 18 , has this statement : " Since the government has never paid taxes on its property it was deemed fitting , beginning with 1878 , that it pay half of the District 's municipal expenses . The residents pay the rest . " It is true that under the Act of Congress of 1878 the United States Government committed itself to pay half of the municipal expenses of the District of Columbia . This was done for a number of years , but for the year 1922 it was changed to a sixty-forty basis  --  that is , the taxpayers of the District of Columbia paid 60 per cent and the United States paid 40 eper cent . This arrangement continued through 1924 . Starting in 1925 , Congress began what was termed the " lump sum " appropriation , and this has been continued , with decreasing sums appropriated by the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 1935 fixed the Federal payment at $5,700,000 , but provided that 70 per cent of $1,759,500 for PWA sewer allotment and 70 per cent of $148,650 PWA allotment for parks should be deducted . Of the sewer allotment $250,000 was refunded to PWA , thus making $1,658,150 as the sum used to compute the 70 per cent reimbursement and $4,539,295 as the net Federal payment for 1935 . In other words , instead of paying half of the expenses as the Act of 1878 contemplated , the United States is now contributing only one-eighth . and this in spite of the fact that the government has , in the past fifteen years , more than doubled its holdings of real estate in the District , all of which are tax exempt . It is bad enough that the residents of the District are denied suffrage ; it is worse that they have to contribute to the upkeep of the Federal city in a manner greatly in excess of the requirements of the ordinary municipality . There might be some force to the argument that the Congress should be the governing body @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ direction of their municipal affairs . There is certainly no justification for depriving the residents of the District of a vote for President and Vice President or representation in the House and Senate . G. R. LaNemes . Washington , Dec. 30 , 1938 . Federal Contribution Cut To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : The original 1878 charter setting up a commission form of government for the District of Columbia provided a 50 per cent contribution by the Federal Government toward municipal expenses . As every one in Washington knows , this contribution has been greatly reduced since 1922. when the old bonded indebtedness of the District was liquidated . The reference in the article was not intended to convey the impression that the Federal Government still pays 50 per cent of our upkeep . DELBERT CLARK . Washington , Dec. 23 , 1938 . On the Cooking of Steak To THE EDITOR OF THE NEW YORK TIMES : On this , my first visit to New York , I am dismayed to find that here a succulent , medium-rare. steak is more than rare . Friends tell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shortcoming is doubly true of home cooking . May I suggest that those who would enjoy this most highly fe.vored dish follow these suggestions ? The steak , preferably a Delmonico , should be cut evenly , to a thickness of two inches , with most of the fat and the " tail " removed . The oven should be preheated until the interior glows . If the flow of gas is strong , the steak then is sprinkled liberally with paprika and placed in the broiler so that the tips of the flames lick it . With a good oven six minutes is enough for one side . Then turn it for five minutes . Now turn off the gas and permit the steak to rest in the closed oven for three minutes . This last step is what turns the raw center into that delectable pink shade so difficult to achieve . If this design for broiling fails in any respect the fault lies either with the quality of the meat , the evenness of the cut , the heating capacity of the oven or the impatience of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ sizzling meat , with plenty of salt and pepper added , completes what should prove a culinary triumph . E. W- D. New York , Dec. 29 , 1938 . Praise for Traffic Police To THE EDITOR OF THE New YORK TIMES I have seen no mention oc the remarkably fine handling of traffic by the Police during the tie-up of the upper ramp of the Queensboro Bridge during repaving operations . The quiet , courteous efficiency of the Policemen in this fine piece of work deserves high praise . Their easing of tension on drivers and passengers is reflected in the lack of accidents during those several weeks . This record should allay any fears on the part of out-of-town visitors to the World 's Fair , as it is typical of the work of these men in any emergency . THOMAS J. SCANNELL .
