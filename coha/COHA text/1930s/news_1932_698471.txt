txt It is a pity - that Mayor WALKER exposed himself to the temptations of a Tammany " Victory dinner . " His mercurial temperament could not withstand the loud acclaim accorded him , and he was betrayed into saying many foolish things , and some defiant ones , which may yet cause him regret . He too readily joined in the comfortable assumption of Tammany that it has its foot on the necks of the people of this city . Mayor WALKER took occasion to reaffirm his unswerving devotion to Tammany Hall . He boasted that he is a Tammany Mayor . Turning to the boss of Tammany , he hailed Mr. CURRY as co-ruler with himself of Greater New York . This was dangerous exaltation of a man who holds no elective office , yet whom the Mayor of the city delights to honor as one having greater power than all the heads of departments and all the judges in this city . All that can be said is that if the voters of New York like to have that kind of insult rammed down their throats @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that Tammany may choose to inflict upon them . Of more immediate concern is the Mayor 's praise of Tammany 's civic virtue . In view of what has been uncovered during the past few months , it requires unbounded effrontery in Mr. WALKER to assert that the investigators have found nothing to cast doubt upon the perfect purity of the City Administration from top to bottom . Mayor WALKER would not have to put too great a strain upon his daring to testify in court , as did the widow of the late RICHARD CROKER , that in addition to all his other qualities " Li r . CROKER was a saint . " That must have been when he was sick , for the devil a saint was he when he was not . But Mayor WALKER can not be so unperceptive as not to know how the charges and the proofs against Tammany men have filtered their way into public opinion . They have made the Mayor 's boasts sound merely like additional jokes of the kind that now float around everywhere . Swollen bank accounts , mythical @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  all these things are , to be sure , jested about and made the subject of humorous comment and cartoon , but the Mayor should know that they have also sunk deep into the consciousness of honest men and filled them with redoubled loathing of the whole Tammany system . It is both bad taste and bad tactics for Mayor WALKER to ignore all this and defy decent public sentiment . He has not yet passed through his own ordeal . In recent weeks he has been under a severe test of his administrative ability , and has been compelled to make several rapid shifts and to eat a lot of humble pie in order to save the city from the financial disaster with which his measures threatened it . In all this there was no hint of corruption ; but when a public official has been caught in such blundering and vacillation he ought to be , for a time at least , a little more modest and quiet . Mayor WALKER , however , came forward on Thursday night to join the Tammany chant of triumph . Its @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ long as this eit : , is content with the kind of govern meat which Tammany condescend , to give it .
