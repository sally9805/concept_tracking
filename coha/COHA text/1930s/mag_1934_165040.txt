Of the $20,000,000,000 worth of U. S. property exempt from taxation , nearly one quarter is owned by churches . Custom has sanctified this exemption , which stems from the time when Church and State were one . When they separated ( Massachusetts had a State-supported Church until 1833 ) , it was assumed that church property was devoted to public good . But currently more and more churchmen are beginning to question.their right to accept what amounts to a State subsidy for 210,924 U. S. church buildings . <P> Last December in Manhattan , Rabbi Stephen Samuel Wise , Bishop Francis John McConnell and Dr. John Haynes Holmes , seasoned Liberals , urged that " the special economic privileges of the church " be curtailed because they had been abused . They listed the values of the richest Manhattan churches : * Trinity ... . $25,000,000 St. Paul 's Chapel 6,600,600 St. Bartholomew 's 5,400,000 St. Thomas 5,000,000 Collegiate Church of St. Nicholas 4,000,000 Fifth Avenue Presbyterian 3,850,000 Brick Presbyterian 3,600,000 <P> The Christian Century urged that exemption be reconsidered ; denominational bodies discussed it and last @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rev. Charles Stelzle , Presbyterian sociologist and publicist . In an interview in the New York World-Telegram he said : <P> " We boast of our religious liberty , but when we compel a disbeliever in religion to support the Church through tax exemption we go back to the days when everybody was compelled to finance the churches . To say that the church helps decrease the amount of taxes because it reduces crime , for example , is somewhat gratuitous . . . . " <P> Dr. Stelzle 's argument was answered by Lawson Purdy , tax expert and comptroller of rich old Trinity , which by its 200-year old charter not only possesses valuable ( and taxable ) business and tenement properties but also has a right to all whales washed up on the lower West shore of Manhattan Island . Mr. Purdy argued that if church property were taxed its value would at once shrink because assessment is based upon market value . The market value of St. Patrick 's Cathedral would be nothing because no one could afford it . Furthermore , said Mr. Purdy , the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is based on the fact that it is an open space in the shadows of downtown Manhattan . If it were sold for building its worth would decline , dragging down with it the worth of nearby buildings which overlook it . Hence its value is " fiction . " <P> *Appraised value of Manhattan 's two cathedrals : St. Patrick 's , $14,500,000 ; St. John the Divine , $11,300,000.
