BLACK LIGHT " Public opinion ? Wow ! The thing to do with that stuff is to make it  --  mold it  --  navigate it . Look out for the tides and storms and currents . I can do it . Damn , I understand her now , I 've been a blind superstitiousidiot ! " He walked faster , leaving Chandri Lal and the ayah far behind him . Ile had forgotten the temple ceremony and the Yogi . He had forgotten Hawkes . " She 's public opinion . She 's it , idealized . Greedyfat  --  cunning  --  tyrannical  --  cruel  --  jealous  --  enviousintolerant  --  ahypocrite  --  a coward  --  opportunist  --  liar . She is all that  --  and yet she is n't . I 've got to separate ' ern in my mind . How come ? That needs puzzling out . " Ile was excited . He had forgotten boredom . He had forgotten the dull inertia that usually crept into some corner of his brain when he thought of his mother . He had seen , as it were , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he could drive , he believed , his new-found wedge . It did not occur to him that he was using arguments familiar to king 's sons , to rebels against the divine right of kings , and to all the archiconoclastsof history . It seemed to him he was the first discoverer of something new . " Mother , " he said to himself , " is a victim . It is n't she who uses power . Power uses her . " In a flash , as a man sees in a dream cause and effect and process simultaneously , he discerned the tactics and the strategy that he must use . " Separate her from the power in my own mind . She 's my mother . I t is n't . It is n't a disease exactly , but call it one for the sake of clarity . It causes a disease . She 's as good as mad this minute  --  mad with a cold intelligencethat outwits anything human , her own humanity included . It 's as merciless to her as to any one else @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ makes her stupid in her hour of triumph . Good God ! How stupid I 've been . The thing for me to do , fromBLACK LIGHT 41now on , is to attack it , not her  --  and not to attack it like a damned fool and be overwhelmed . Guile  --  sub-tlety Absorbed in thought he walked beyond the lane between the bougainvilleas , where the sign-board bearing Cummings , the district collector 's name , was clearly legible in the moonlight . " God , but I 'll need to be subtle ! " He noticed he had walked too far , and turned back . " She 's on its side . It 's her God and her glory . Give her half a hint that I 'm awake at last , and she 'll kill me as she killed Dad . He was half awake before the end . I think he knew she killed him . She broke his will . That broke his health . She make him sign that trust deed and then put him on his back and hired three nurses . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of that before . flow many doctors  --  five ?  --  six ? And they could n't agree What to call the disease . I can name it for them . Octopus-itis ! She strangled his will . He simply quit and left her victrix on a bloodless battle-field . Bloodless ? 11. e had n't a drop of blood left in him . I wonder if he loved her . I do n't . But I do n't hate her any longer . And I wo n't quit . I 'll be damned if I 'll quit . " He turned up the lane between the bougainvilleas  --  a narrow curved lane rising steeply to the garden surroundingCummings ' bungalow . The gate was open ; lie made scarcely a sound as he entered because the dust lay deep on the tiles of the garden path . The bungalow faced eastward and the garden gate was to the south , so that he had to approach one end of the long verandah , where there was a screen of painted reeds to provide privacy ; that and the shadows combined @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ windows in front of the house . He had no intention of eavesdropping , but his mother 's voice was too distinct not to be recognized ; and to that he had been forced to listen since he was a child . It was a habit . " What would life be without our illusions ? And42 BLACK LIGHTwho knows that the illusions are not more genuine than what we think is real ? " Then the voice of Cummings : " Stark reality  --  stark reality  --  sordid grim reality  --  that is the life of a Government official , Mrs. Beddington . If I had one illusion left , I would not know what to do with it . " His mother : " When I was a little girl my dolls provided the illusion . I had a boy-doll that was the inspiration for most of my dreams . I have that doll even to-day , tucked away in a drawer . Sawdust , I suppose you will say  --  a Little Lord Fauntleroy suit  --  a yellow wig  --  a wax face , with the paint gone @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ glass  --  one eye missing . But around that doll I built my dreams of a prince charming who should come into my life and make it romantic . " " Did he ? " " Not yet . I am like Queen Elizabeth , still hoping . Money , yes . Mr. Beddington possessed the gift of makingmoney . He could think of nothing else . We were not romantic . " " Money , to me , " said Cummings , " is the most romantictheme on earth . Money  --  the blood of nations  --  the key to independence  --  the essence of power . They tell you money ca n't buy happiness . I say it can . " Sharply : " Is that you , Joe ? " Joe mounted the steps . He merely nodded to Cummings  --  understoodhim , and lacked enough hypocrisy to pretend to feel more than tolerantly civil . But he stared at his mother . She was full in moonlight , all two hundred pounds of her , in a dress that he knew had made a modiste nearly frantic @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ; her gowns were trophies wrung from defeated artistes whose profit was gone in time and overtime , and whose bills were paid when Mrs. Beddington saw fit . Such ingrates sometimes even sued her . She looked magnificent . Joe knew she had saved thatBLACK LIGHT 43dress for an " occasion . " Her conversation , too , was the sort that she reserved for disarming strangers when she had drastic ends in view . He wondered what design she had on Cummings . He could see at a glance that she had pumped him to a point where she knew the exact limits of his imagination and could foresee to a fraction how lie would react to any given impulse . She would presently provide the impulse  --  not that that made any difference , or was of the slightest interest to her son ; but he could not help wondering why she should waste her arts on such a futile person . " Ready to go to the hotel , Mother ? Shall I call for the rickshaw ? " " Not yet . I was telling @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and have a whisky with us . What 's your hurry ? You Americans are always on the run , and what on earth do you gain by it ? I understand you even hurry to your funerals in a motor-hearse . I think that comical . If you hurried off to bed now , you would probably only lie awake inventinga way of doing twice as much in half the time to-morrow . " " Probably , " said Joe . " The mistake , of course , that we made was to insist on independence . We ought to have kissed King George on both cheeks . Then we 'd have been taught , like India , how to behave . " IIe was sorry at once that he had said it . Cummings was too futile to be worth snubbing and too dull to enjoy an argument with , but an argument now was inevitable ; he had invited one ; and , what made it worse , he could see that he had played into his mother 's hand in some way . Desperately he sought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the nautch-girls at that temple . " Cummings jumped at that . He was the type that loves to display familiarity with subjects on which he ca n't be checked up every easily . It opened the way too , for a retort : 44 BLACK LIGHT " Do n't try making love to them . Be advised by me and control your curiosity and instincts , both , as long as you stay here . " Joe let that pass . Cummings looked pleased with himself and exchanged a glance with Joe 's mother . Middle-aged , fat bachelor he might be , but he knew how to give a younger man the right cue at the proper moment . IIe desired her to appreciate it , and apparently she did ; she could disguise her feelings from almost any one except her son , who looked the other way . Joe yawned and Cummings cleared his throat : " Those are very unusual nautch-girls . There are none other like them in India . Generally speaking , I regret to say , the Indian nautch-girls are a blot on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficult for us to deal with . They 're a social evil so protected by religious custom and priestly privilege that no government can do anything about it . They belong to the temple . They 're married to trees or to graven images . Their morals generally speaking  --  judged , that is , by our standards  --  are  --  well  --  they have n't any . " " How are they recruited ? " Joe asked . " All sorts of ways . Many of them are the daughters of nautch-girls . Some are the daughters of well-to-do , high-caste Indians who dedicate them to the temple , usually along with an endowment . Some of them  --  the less privileged ones  --  are child-widows , who are given that means of escape from the otherwise deadly existence of the Hindu widow , who becomes the slave of her husband 's parents . A few of them are the daughters of wealthy public prostitutes . As a rule they are all intensively trained , extremely highly educated in the legendary mysticism of the cult to which they are attached @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ make yourself believe . " " Those girls I saw to-night , " said Joe , " were marvelous . I 've seen convent children in the States whoBLACK LIGHT 45looked much less spiritual . Loose women do n't look as they did  --  at least , not any that I ever saw . " Cummings suppressed the interruption with a fatly important hand : " I was coming to that . This temple is unique . It is very ancient and was formerly Buddhist . A century or so ago its Hindu priests were partly reconverted to the Buddhist teaching . Blending one traditional philosophywith another , as I understand it , they were able to discard the grosser forms of superstition and retain the essence of both teachings , with the result that somethingnew and very remarkably good grew out of it . They retained the secrecy , but not the exclusiveness  --  to some extent the theory of caste , but not its system . I am told they sent some very highly educated priests to Europe to study the better known types of Christianity , from which @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are astonishingly tolerant of Christian missionaries . They own all the land hereabouts and could have made it next to impossible for Christian missionaries to obtain a foothold ; but what they actually did was to let them have land for schools and so on at a rent so nominal that it amounted to a gift . They 're funny . I believe they 're trying to convert the missionaries . L ; ut they wo n't let any outsider inside their temple , and they 're rather touchy about strangers witnessing their temple rites . They 're on very good terms , by the way , with the Catholic priest , who has established a hospital , to which they contribute very liberally from the temple funds . " Mrs. Beddington purred . She almost looked like a well fed cat when there was a mouse to be coaxed within reach of her paws . Her bulk seemed all softly luxurious comfort . She exuded invitation and apprecia-l ion . Her son might recognize , even by lamplight , a certainhard glint in her eyes ; but a mouse , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from a rather handsome widow. 46 BLACK LIGHT " Oh , how fascinating , Mr. Cummings ! ' That a wonderful life you must lead , with all this opportunity to study life 's drama ! Most of us waste our lives , do n't we ? You should write a book  --  truly you should . " " Ah ! " remarked Cummings , but he deceived no one , not even himself . IIe was much too lazy mentally to write anything except a cut-and-dried report . However , he enjoyed the flattery . Joe wondered again why his mother possibly could wish to ensnare such a futile person  --  andagain , from habit , not from sympathy , he straightway played into her hand . " My mother loves to look into the guts of things , " he volunteered . Cummings blinked ; he thought the expression coarse ; he was already unconsciously taking the side of the mother against the son . " Your mother strikes me as a very able woman , if I may say so without offense . It 's rare to find @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to speak . If I had had such a mother as yours , I think I would have had more of a career . " The imputation that Joe Beddington was a loafer in his estimation was only vaguely veiled . Joe glanced at his mother and smiled to himself . He changed the subject , abruptly : " I 'd like to see the inside of that temple . " " Impossible , my dear man , so it 's no use wishing . But why see it ? Gloom  --  dirt -- images of gods on ancient walls  --  obscene  --  monstrous  --  stupid . There are lots of other places where you can see it all , price two rupees , and a picture post-card thrown in . " " You know , I suppose . " " I can guess . One does n't live in India for twenty-five years without knowing what temples are like . Archeology , in my humble opinion , is an over-rated subject . It 's like art in general , which got the Greeks nowhere  --  got China , Egypt , India nowhere . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ decadence . As soon as a nation takes up art it goes to pieces and gets conquered . " BLACK LIGHT 47It was aimed , of course , at Joe . Joe 's mother understood , and relished it . " Joe , I think , would rather be an artist than a business man , " she remarked . " He paints really quite beautifullywhen he has the time . " It was a favorite trick of hers to tempt confidence and sympathy by hinting that her only son was a disappointingperson . She was equally ready at any moment to advertise him as the greatest genius alive . It all depended on the circumstances and the view-point of her victim . Joe wondered again what she could see worth conquering in Cummings ; he knew that her perceptionwas uncanny and her sense for intrigue and strategy Bismarckian ; but why pick such a specimen as Cummings ? Why waste genius ? He gave it up . " Let 's go home to bed , " he suggested , yawning . " Shall I shout for the rickshaw ? " Mrs. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intimate to Cummings that she could walk in spite of her weight . Joe knew that she hated to have dust invade her shoes . However , it was only a short way to the hotel ; if she should turn badtemperedhe could endure it during those few minutes . IIe nodded to Cummings  --  shook hands , since Cummings seemed to wish that  --  and waited at the foot of the verandah steps , signing to the sleepy rickshaw coolies to go along home . His mother was in no haste : " A delightful evening . What a time we two had until that gloomy person interrupted us ! Imagine my telling you all about my dolls ! It must have been the magic of the moonlight and your hospitality . Some day you must tell me all about the princess you have cherishedin your dreams  --  I believe you 're as romantic as I am under that proconsular mask of yours . " Cummings almost writhed with pleasure at being likened to a grim proconsul . He had missed promotion . Ile was a little lucky if the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ last year on his half-pay. 48 BLACK LIGHT " Romantic ? " he answered . He would be anything to please her , but it was hard to think of phrases on the spur of the moment . " Ah , but I have never dared to speak of it . " " You shall tell me , " said Mrs. Beddington . " Confess  --  you owe me that revenge . Besides , it will do you good to talk of it . Romance dies , if it is not shared with some one . And romance is good for all of us . Good night . " On the way home Joe kept silence until his mother paused to kick the dust out of her shoes , holding his shoulder to balance herself . " Joe , " she remarked suddenly , " I wish you could be more polite to people . You were positively rude to that man . It was disgraceful . Why , you could n't even shake hands without scowling . " " He 's such an ass , " Joe answered . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " " Mother , you know he 's an ass . What are you planning ? To make him find that purely hypothetical cholera baby ? I 'll bet he bungles it . Probably he 'll foist a sweeper 's daughter on you  --  or perhaps a halfcastebrat with rickets and a chi-chi accent . Then what ? " Mrs. Beddington removed her other shoe , shook out its contents , replaced it and then waited for her son to kneel and fasten up the strap . " I have all along intended you should find that child , " she answered . " It will give you a chance to use those wits you are so proud of . When I have a hunch I am never far wrong . I know the child lives . I know it , I know it . So you look for her , and use all your ingenuity . Meanwhile , I will cultivate Mr. Cummings , so that in case you have to overstep the boundaries a bit there will be some one to stand between you and the lawyers . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made Joe shudder , since it always meant that she was contemplatingtreachery of some kind that she would not evenBLACK LIGHT 49hint at until it would be too late to prevent her . He answered grimly : " I have taken steps already . " " You speak as if I had asked you to cut your throat . Listen , Joe . I wo n't have you being sulky with me . I wo n't stand it for a minute . If there 's one thing I will not endure , it 's disloyalty . Your father knew you all right when he had that deed drawn . He knew what he was doing when he put that clause in giving me the right to cut you off by a stroke of a pen without a nickel .. One would think , to see your long face , that you were jealous of a child you 'd never seen . " Joe laughed . " Come on , Mother , " he said , " there 's pen and ink at the hotel . Cut me off and set me @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ him . " Joe , I 'm nervous . Ca n't you see I need comforting ? Are you so mean you wo n't oblige me during the , few years I have to live ? Is n't it soon enough - to be independent when I 'm dead and gone ? Do you wish me dead ? " He yielded  --  put his arm around her . She was as well as he was , and he knew it . She was insincere ; lie knew that also . But whenever she ceased threateningand coaxed him , there always stole over him that feeling of helplessness that was so like the effect of a drug that it made him feel worthless  --  even wicked . He had to take an antidote for it ; when his mother had gone to bed he carried out a chair into the compound and made charcoal sketches of servants sleeping in the shadows under gaunt wind-twisted trees . CHAPTER FOUR " You wish to question me ? " JoE sat at breakfast on the hotel verandah , prodding export bacon with an import fork and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ create a universe . His mother had sent for him to her bedroom and had made him sign some documents of no particular importance except to nine unfortunates in New York , whose jobs had now ceased to exist . " Just like her . It 's murder , as I sit here  --  long-distance murder by mail . They were n't rowing their weight . But is she ! And am I ? Are dividends the one criterion ? If one of those poor devils  --  Weism.uiler  --  does n't commit suicide I 'll take my hat off to him  --  sick wife  --  seven kids  --  a mortgage  --  probably car and piano half paid for . Dad never did that kind of dirt . He flogged old horses , but he did n't turn them out to starve . It was the last nail in the old man 's coffin when he learned about her firing all the old-timers . She has more than quadrupled the money Dad left . He never gave a cent to charity , and she has given away more than he earned in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ And she is n't . Damn ! I hate her . " Gone was last night 's resolution . He looked around him at the white-clad servants standing along the verandahrail in abject adoration of his mother 's millions . There were far too many of them ; she had insisted on traveling like a circus , as he phrased it , with a private car on the railway and a private crew of rickshaw coolies , to say nothing of interpreters , bearers , a cook , two cook 's assistants and a boy . Beyond them , beneath the compound trees were unnumberedjob-hunters , cheek by jowl with beggars , conjurers , acrobats and " guides . " Among them he noticed50BLACK LIGHT 51Chandri Lal with his basket of cobras ; and , not very far from Chandri Lal , the ayah . They added in some vague way to his annoyance . It was ridiculous to think they might be spying on him . For whom could they be spying ? But why else were they here ? Why did they keep on staring at him ? On @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boxes if he as much as glanced in their direction , meanwhile arranging trash for his inspection  --  arrangingthe stuff so that he could hardly step off the verandah without treading on some of it . Pariah dogs were sniffing around the compound . Nine unpleasantlookingcrows , with bright eyes on the breakfast food and obscene voices making probably appropriate remarks , were perched on the rail at the far end . The proprietor , smugly subservient , stood with his back to the doorway where he could watch the merchants and keep account of his rake-off from the price of anything they might succeed in selling . There were no other guests in the hotel ; there was that much relief . However , presently came Hawkes , slapping his leg with a swagger-cane and much too perky to harmonize with Joe 's mood . " I suppose he wants more money . " Joe decided not to give him any . He turned his back  - -   - -  resumed dissection of the embalmed remains of a Chicago pig , fried to a boracic cinder  --  prodding at it . I lut he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the eyes of indigestion , stared up from the plate and put him out of countenance . The grease had grown cold ; a fat fly struggled in it . Toast , weak marmalade and strong tea . Hawkes invaded the verandah , perfectly aware of the annoyance he was causing ; soldiering equips a man with a brass face for irritability to grind itself against . No snubbing Hawkes . " Good morning , sir . I 've news . " " Sit down then . Light your pipe . Tea 's rotten . Ilave some , " 52 BLACK LIGHT " Thanks , sir , I 've had breakfast . And if I 'd tell the news myself you might think I was lying . " " There would be nothing abnormal about that . I 'm quite used to disbelieving people . " " Yes , sir . And I want my thousand pounds . I 'd like to take you straight to the source where I got my information . " " What information ? " " The identity and present whereabouts of that young woman that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's face at once . He had learned from his mother . Show her , black on white , a soundly reasoned statement and she would pitilessly and without shame rend it until no one but herself believed it even worth another moment 's thought . " Remember this , Joe : if it 's good , it wo n't be worse for being doubted . The more you can make others doubt it , the cheaper it 's yours in the long run . So do n't believe any one  --  anything , until you 've seen all sides of it . Make others sick of hanging on . That 's business . " He had learned in the end to doubt her also . A mere stranger such as Hawkes had no chance to get under his guard . " I have letters to write . Sorry . " Hawkes , a trifle over-eager to persuade him , made a wrong move : " Sir , you saw me punch a man last night . His gang is after that young woman . " " Sounds bad . As @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ down the social scale my mother would not be inter-ested . " IIawkes saw his mistake . He decided to show his own quality and see what came of it . " All right , sir . I 've done my part . Here 's that three hundred you gave me for expenses . I do n't need it . " IIe laid the money on the table . Joe let it stay , with the corner of one eye watching Hawkes ; it might be Hawkes ' way of suggesting a tip . But IIawkes stepped away from the table . " Send for me , sir , any time you wish . I 'll tell your servant where to find me . " BLACK LIGHT 53 " Why not tell your news ? " Joe asked him . " No , sir . If you 'll take it straight as man to man  --  it may sound fishy , but it 's fact  --  I would n't take a thousand pounds to he called a liar by you or any one . " Joe had seen senators sell their @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , and found them not worth buying . " I will pay you ten pounds for your news , " he answered . " Keep it , sir . As one man to another , you agreed to pay a thousand pounds if I find the girl . " " All right . Bring her to me . " " Not so easy . If I fetched her , supposing she 'd come , who 's to prove she 's it ? No , sir , proof first  --  that 's fair . Then when you set eyes on her I get my thousand and no argument . " Joe still suspected him . However , he heard his mother 's voice . She was getting up , and finding fault . He knew that mood . He leaped at anything to escape her . " All right , I 'll go with you . " He caught the proprietor'seye . " Two horses ! " " Ek particularly dum ! " Hawkes added . " Make it sudden . " That Hindu had noticed the interrelation of speed and profit @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ turban flying , scandalized crows on the wing , and the pariah dogs in flight in front of him , he scooted across the compound to the stable , where a needy relativecontractorkept starved horses and well fed flies . Long before Mrs. Beddington 's voice announced through an open window that her shoes were no place for cockroaches , two unenthusiastic horses drooped in front of the verandah . Joe was swift ; in another moment he and Hawkes , at a comfortless trot in the dust outside the compound wall , could hear her doing her worst to make the universe all wretched . Joe shuddered : " Always that way when she has done dirt . Justifies54 BLACK LIGHTherself by torturing some other helpless human . Then she 'll feed the pariah dogs on buttered toast and gyp the peddlers out of half their junk . By the time I return she 'll feel pious and want me to take her to call on missionaries . " He hardly noticed where Hawkes was leading him . Ile remembered passing a squadron of native cavalry out exercising horses  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their officers did not halt to talk to him  --  as likely as not damned decent fellows who would invite him to call on the mess . He could enjoy meeting them if it were n't for his mother ; she would insist on their being introduced to her . She would probably make their mess a gift of some useless ornamentpicked up in Kashmir . She would ask the Colonel 's confidential advice about his , Joe 's , character . He understood her game from a to izzard understood , yet could not defeat it . She was his mother , worse luck . There are limits to what conscience will let a man do to his mother , even if he hates her , for accumulatedreasons . Knowing resentment would give him a headache he tried to interest himself in the streets and the early traffic . They had reached the heart of the native city almost before he realized it . He remembered now that there were things to see in this place . There were said to be architectural wonders  --  freaks that had set the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ their estimated dates . He began to notice some of them  --  amazing carvings on patched walls at the end of mean streets , old and new all fitted into one another as if an earthquake , or perhaps a dozen earthquakes had flattened the city and , after each cataclysm , men had rebuilt with the old material . One image that he saw was upside down -- a dozen tons of it incorporated in a wall whose greater part was almost modern brick  --  perhaps a thousand-year-old brick , or even more recent than that . BLACK LIGHT 55It was a hodge-podge city . Corrugated iron side by side with ancient masonry and carved teak blackened by the course of centuries . Trees in which monkeys sported . Sacred trees a-flutter with scraps of rag and colored paper to remind some godlet of a bribe paid and a promise taken , in return , for granted . Walls withoutwindows . Shops all unglazed window , with a wall behind them . Thatch , tile , rotting canvas  --  and a roof here and there whose ponderous calm suggested destiny perceived and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ chaste and pearl-gray in the shadows of high trees , frowned at from a hundred feet away by the obscene divinities carved on the gloom of a Hindu temple . Stinks  --  and then a breath of Oriental pertume  --  spices , dry dung and the horizonless scent of piles of gunny-sacks . An elephant or two  --  incessant streams of laden asses  --  bullock-carts  --  innumerable sweating porters , threading their way through a crowd whose black umbrellas cheapened sunlight . Vivid colors splashed on shadow  --  dark holes  --  dinginess drowned in golden light where clouds of parakeets as green as emeralds shot screaming from tree to tree  --  veiled women  --  unveiled girls with white teeth dipping brass jars at a fountain  --  Ford cars  --  insolent policemen swingingyellow clubs . And then , when they paused at a trough that was a gocllet 's lap , to let the horses drink , none else than Chandri Lai , his flat , round basketful of cobras on his head . The ayah , draped in dingy black , was less than half a street behind him . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ speed we 've come ? " " The same as rats , sir . They know scores of shortcutswhere a horse ca n't get through . " " What are they spying on me for ? " " They 're not spying . It 's the jackal system . Followa tiger long enough and something happens . It 's like that piece in the Bible , sir , about the woman and her importunity  --  except that those two do n't know56 BLACK LIGHTwhat they want . What turns up ca n't be worse than what they 've got , that 's all . " Joe doubted it . He half suspected Hawkes of having told those two to follow , and he was still in a mood to be quarrelsome . Ile had an acrid comment hesitating on his teeth , when a bheestee went by swishing water from his goatskin mussuk . Just as no man can slay even himself in the presence of one of Leonardo 's paintings , so none can harbor hatred with the smell in his nostrils of freshly sprinkled dry earth . Perfectly unconscious @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ up like sap and he decided that to be a circus for whoever chose to stare at him was better fun than doingnothing . He , too , was a spectator , growing curious . " Let 's go . " Hawkes led through by-ways to a sunlit court , whose paving stones were masonry from ancient walls . Grass grew here and there between the cracks . In places , faintly visible , were carvings worn smooth by the tread of centuries . The buildings were all ancient , except one , a little lower than the rest , that occupied a corner and was white , in contrast to the gray-green dinginess of all the others . It had awnings , striped red and yellow , and the two-story wall that faced the street was pierced with as many windows as a colonial house in Salem . The windows had muslin curtains , clean and trim . The flat roof was entirely tented over and hung with a line of paper Chinese lanterns . " Here we are , " said Hawkes . He hitched the horses to a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ guess what that is , sir ? That 's a hook off a siege-gun carriage that was drawn by elephants at Plassy . There 's a story to it ; but maybe she 'll tell you herself . " He used his swagger-cane to beat a tattoo on the brass-bound teak front door . Then he lifted the latch and the top half opened . " Anybody home ? " A parrot answered  --  " Cup o ' caw-fee  --  Polly want aBLACK LIGHT 57cup o ' caw-fee ? " Then footsteps on a tiled floor . Suddenlya smell of lavender , and some one in larkspurfight-bluelinen stood framed in the door like a painting , with dimness behind her . " Ilawkesey ! Well , come in . My house is a mess ; you must excuse it  --  but you soldiers notice everything . " She had snow-white hair brushed well back from her forehead and pinned in an old-fashioned knot . Her eyes were almost baby-blue ; they mocked the thin line of a mouth that seemed to disapprove of such amusementas those eyes insisted on enjoying . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ seldom , having also diplomatic skill and self-restraint besides unconquerable courage . She wore a gold chain and a locket . The sleeves at each wrist were pinned with old cameo brooches . Wrinkled , used but well-kept , very shapely hands . She was not more than five feet tall and slightly built  --  sixty years of age or thereabouts , but upright as an arrow and , beyond words , beautiful . She drew the lower latch and glanced at Hawkes ' boots as she swung the half-door open . Hawkes kicked the wall and flicked the dust off with his handkerchief . " Mr. Beddington  --  Miss Annie Weems . " She bowed , appraising Joe , then suddenly shook hands , as if the blue eyes had discovered something that the lips refused to tell . They were a wee mite stern , those lips -- a bit convinced , perhaps , of masculine infidelity , deplorable but comprehensible and not beyond forgiveness . " My school , " she said , turning to lead the way in . She turned as neatly as they used to in the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ holiday . No pupils to tidy up . You must n't look . " They followed her across a red-tiled floor that was as clean as the floor of a dairy . There were benches of scrubbed wood , mats folded and piled in a corner , a blackboard , a desk and a chair and rows of book-shelves . There was not even dust in the beams of sunlight slant-58 BLACK LIGHTing through the windows . Nothing seemed soiled or out of place , and nothing even faded except the flowers ; those were yesterday 's  --  the only hint of Asia ; all the rest was neat New England , even to the ribboned cat that came and rubbed against Joe 's trousers legs . " There , Kitty likes you . I have never known her to make a mistake . " She led past a grandfather clock in a passage that contained a dresser made of maple-wood , its shelves loaded with Derby chinaware , into a room that might have been a parlor in a Massachusetts village , except that there were no stuffed birds in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ built not less than half a century ago and varnished to match the maple chairs and gate-leg table . Flowers everywhere  --  framed paintingsof New England landscapes  --  a parrot perch with seed and water-cups at either end . Rag rugs on a polished teak floor . Nothing lacking but a fireplace  --  and in place of that a white stone altar carved with long-stemmed lotus-flowers , built into the strong foundationsof the house by pious Hindus , and now used by the cat as a snoozing place between two long-stemmed Copenhagen vases . " You wish to question me ? " She chose the armchair near the window and sat facing Joe and Hawkes , hands in her lap . Joe hesitated . Since she put it that way he felt he had no right to question her . Hawkes intervened : " Miss Weems has run a private school here since  --  how long is it , Miss ? " " Twenty-seven years . " " Anyhow , " said Hawkes , " for seventeen years or more I believe she has known the girl you 're looking for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ eyes alight with interest and something else that might have been excitement . Joe crossed his legs and began calmly : " One and twenty years ago  --  about  --  I do n't rememBLACKLIGHT 59ber dates  --  Carrie Morgan , who was my mother 's youngestbridesmaid , married a young professor of botany named Owen Wilburforce and came to this part of India . We were informed she gave birth to a daughter ; she is supposed to have written to that effect to an aunt in Charleston , but the letter has been lost . She and her husband are supposed to have died of cholera not long afterward , and their effects were said to have been burned in a raid by dacoits , who set fire to the house they lived in . But there was a plausible , undocumentedstory that an ayah  --  said to have been a wet-nurse  --  carried away the baby and concealed it . The girl should now be twenty years old , more or less . Hawkes appears to believe that you know a young woman who might be that one . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her identity . Is that so ? " Annie Weems looked straight at him and blinked . She produced a plain white hemstitched handkerchief and touched her lips . She glanced at the cat  --  at the parrot  --  and back at Joe . Her eyes were steady now ; it was her lips that seemed to tremble , and there was a catch in her throat ; she swallowed before answering : " It may be . " CHAPTER FIVE " Amrita is a sort of Joan of Arc . " IT FELT like Sunday . From without there were only a few sounds ; some one , probably a servant , moved about a courtyard . A crow cawed on a near-by roof . Annie Weems picked up her reading spectacles from beside the book on the table , tried them on , and put them down again . " About the proof , Miss ? " IIawkes suggested . " Judas Iscariot once sold Jesus , " she retorted . Slapped down , as it were , Hawkes prodded his boot with his swagger-cane . Joe felt curiously @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ said , " will be paid a stipulated sum if the girl is produced along with proof of her identity . That was the agreement . But it might not be wise to let her know who she is , unless she knows already ; nor who is looking for her  --  you see , my mother has no actual obligation . Do you get my meaning ? " " No , sir . " Annie Weems understood perfectly . Joe knew she did . However she was entitled to insist on clarity . " I mean , " he said , " she may be better off in India . Having been brought up in this country among colored people , she might be like a fish out of water in the United States . If she should happen to learn she is being looked for , she might jump to false conclusions . She has no legal claim on us  --  none whatever . " " You would like to look her over , so to speak , without her knowing why ? " " That 's it , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ far more clever than I have any right to suppose you are , " Annie Weems answered . " She is neither deaf , dumb , blind nor unintelligent . I60BLACK LIGHT 61have had her in this school , at intervals , for nearly sixteen years . I have not yet learned how to deceive her , or to keep her uninformed about anything that has stirred her interest . However , you can try . " " Does she talk English ? " Joe asked nervously . " I mean " You are afraid of a chi-chi accent ? If she has one I ca n't detect it . Of course , my ear may be ruined by long association with Indian children . But I taught her to sing at this piano . She has recited , and acted , most of the female parts from Shakespeare , in this room . She has also read such parts of the Bible as are fit for decent folk . I ca n't detect a trace of accent . " " How long have you known she was not an Indian @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beginning . " " Did no one else know ? " " Others did . Some temple priests , for instance . She has been partly brought up in the temple . The priests have been very kind to her . " " Could n't you have saved her from that ? " Joe asked . He kept the note of horror from his voice , but it found means to express itself  --  vibration , probably . " You would have had me turn her over to the Govern-ment ? " " I suppose , something of that sort . " " They would have sent her to one of the Government schools , or to a mission orphanage , " said Annie Weems . " Are those so terrible ? " " Prisons . " She pursed her lips . " They are sometimessanitary . They are places where children are taught to be hypocrites  --  cowardly thinkers , thoroughly mistrusting anything that has spiritual value . I tried to save her from that fate  --  so have the priests . " " Is she a Christian ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ must wait until you get an opportunity to ask God , that is to say , if it is any of your business . " 62 BLACK LIGHTAnnie Weems was becoming belligerent ; the blue eyes glistened with enjoyment of the pugnacity at the corners of her mouth . Joe declined combat . IIe had tact enough to retire gracefully , and sense of strategy enough to leave that kind of conversation to his mother . " She sounds interesting , " he said . " I do n't doubt she is a credit to your care and teaching . I would like to see her at your convenience . Meanwhile , Hawkes said something about proofs of her identity . " Annie Weems glanced at Hawkes , who nodded and stood up , hesitated and then started for the front door . " See that she cleans her feet , and do n't admit that person with the cobras . I will not have them or him in my house . " " Yes , Miss . " Hawkes strode out . His clean white uniform looked somehow dirty in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ produced by suggestion ; if one could judge by his eye and the set of his mouth , the reference to Judas Iscariot had bitten more than skin-deep . Joe thought swiftly . " You are sending for the ayah ? Does this explain why she was spying on me ? Does she know the girl ? How does she know I am inter-ested ? " " Sergeant Hawkes has told me that you saw the temple ceremony last night . There is a Yogi there  --  I think you had some conversation with him . It was he to whom the ayah took the child the moment it was weaned , and it was he who gave it to the temple priests . She suspects any white man who talks to that Yogi ; she is afraid her priestess-princess may be taken from her . " " What is the girl 's name , by the way ? " " Amrita . " Hawkes returned , the ayah following in time to hear the name Amrita . The yellowish whites of her eyes and her wrinkled face betrayed alarm , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she salaamed with reBLACKLIGHT 63spectful familiarity . It was from Joe that she shrugged herself , wrapping her dingy black cotton stuff around her as if that might serve as shield against his irongrayeyes . Joe noticed that she kept her fingers crossed and made curious furtive gestures with her right hand . Hawkes sat down again . The ayah remained standing . There was silence for a moment , interrupted only by the parrot who appeared to know the ayah . " Aural ! " the bird cried . " Amal !  --  Polly want a cracker ! " The ayah smiled and fell again on the defensive , scared of Joe and none too confident of Hawkes whom she seemed to suspect of telling tales . With a gesture of her arms within the long black garment she enwrappedherself in silence . Annie Weems knew how to manage her . " Amal , I want you to tell this sahib why you followed him . " The ayah seemed to understand , but she had the excuse as yet that English was not her language . Itchingto answer , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and waited . Suddenly the ayah 's pent up misery escaped  --  first two tears , like drops of water seeping through cracks in weakening masonry  --  then floods of tears  --  and then the dam went down in a torrent of words that tumbled over one another , gallopingand plunging , ends of sobbing sentences surging to swamp their beginnings and two streams of argument fighting for room in the gap of one muttering throat . She ceased at last for lack of tears and lack of breath to begin the tale over again . " She says , " said Annie Weems , " that that Yogi is her Yogi and she will not have you asking him questions and learning her business . She says she , not you , has fed and combed the Yogi all these years , and cleaned his cell , and eared for him , and asked for nothing in return except a little comfort now and then . Amrita , she says , is her child , not yours . And she says she knows what the Yogi told you yesterday : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Jupiter is a royal planet , so she does not doubt you are a king . She says you are to go away and be a king where you belong , wherever that is . You are not to come into Amrita 's life and cause war inside her , which is what she heard the Yogi say you will do . " " Why does she call Amrita her child ? " Joe asked . No need to interpret . Amal caught the meaning of that question instantly . She burst into another torrent of invective in her own tongue , flinging aside her sari now and going through the motions of nursing a baby , shielding it , loving it  --  suddenly denouncing Joe with out-flung arm and calling Annie Weems to witness  --  down on her knees then and surrendering the child to some one  --  hugging at her heart as if it tortured her and beating at her old dry breasts with knotted fists . On her feet again  --  glaring  --  breathless . " Perfect pantomime , " said Joe . " I 'm sorry @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " Her answer to your question . She says the baby 's parents died of cholera , and bad men came  --  she means dacoits . So she took the child and hid it  --  she was its wet-nurse  --  who else should have taken it ? But she was young in those days and desirable ; she was afraid that the dacoits would catch her and carry her off . And she had no money , so she hid by day and ran by night . And then some one accused her of stealing the child and threatened blackmail ; she became afraid that if she took the child to any one in authority she would be thrown in prison on a false charge . She was not so afraid of the prison , but she knew they would take the child away from her , and she loved it -- could not bear to part with it . So she hid , starving , stealing scraps of food and fearful that her flow of milk would cease  --  as it began to do . At last , in despair , she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it to the temple priests , who have never allowed Amal within the temple precinctsbut have been kind about letting her see the childBLACK LIGHT 65from time to time , outside the temple . So Arnal bor- rowed a little money from the priests , and paid it back . She bought a loom , and lived near by , and made a living for herself . And she has watched that child grow . She has sat with her at the Yogi 's feet by night and listened to the lessons that he gave her . And it was Amal who told me about Amrita , in secret , exacting my promise to keep the secret  --  as indeed I have done , on condition that the child should come here daily to be taught in my school . It was a little difficult at first to get the priests to agree to that , but the Yogi helped us . Ile east her horoscope . " Annie Weems chuckled . " I am told he understands that nonsense . Certainly they think he does . I have my own @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ way , I could cast a thoroughly con- vincing horoscope for any one who puts faith in such fancies  --  though I do n't say , mind you , that there 's nothing in it  --  I have seen some strange coincidences , of whom you are one . At any rate , they let the child come here to my school , and they have even let me visit her within the temple , so I have no personal quarrel with astrology . " " It 's like politics  --  the bunk , with brass tacks here and there , " Joe answered . " Did the ayah ever mention the name of the child 's parents ? " " Wilburforce . " " Any birth certificate available ? " " No . The birth had been registered in the office of the Collector of the district , but the office and all the records were burned by the dacoits . " " Pretty hard to prove then ? " Joe glanced at Hawkes for amusement 's sake . Hawkes shifted his feet ; he had no notion of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ began to feel uneasy . That thousand pounds seemed less material  --  more like an unkind dream of ; effluence with only disappointment in its wake . " Maybe , sir , you might recognize the family likeness i f you saw her , " he suggested. 66 BLACK LIGHT " Mother might . " " She is the child you are looking for , " said Annie Weems . " Not a doubt of it . " Hawkes nodded eagerly . " And it might even be possible to prove her identity legally , " Miss Weems went on . " If there were money coming to her " Not a cent , " Joe interrupted . " I was about to say : if there were money coming to her , even so I do n't think she would wish to give up the life she is leading . She is one of the happiest girls I have ever known  --  I think the happiest . " " I 've heard it said one can be happy in the U. S. A. , " Joe answered . " Ship @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on trees ! " said Hawkes . " I 'm with you there , sir . Me for Hollywood . My name goes on the quota on the same day I get my discharge . I 've heard they make you swear an oath to fight King George the Third . They may throw in Henry the Eighth and Cardinal Wolsey  --  I ' 11 fight all three of ' em . " " Can I see her ? " Joe asked . " Why not ? " " When ? " " She will be here the day after to-morrow . " Miss Weems ' effect on Joe was just the opposite of that of Hawkes . Hawkes ' eagerness had made him hang back . Her coolness urged him forward . Ile felt genuine interest  --  almost excitement . He began to think of reasons other than his boredom why a wait of two days might be inadvisable . " Hawkes said something about a Maharajah sending some of his gang to waylay her and carry her off , " he remembered . " Is there any danger ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " said Annie Weems . " I have been facing danger here for more than twenty years . It is good for us . When danger gets too dangerous , we die and render our account ; it willBLACK LIGHT 67look better to God without cowardice stamped all over it . " But there are risks a decent girl should not run , " Joe objected . " There is a risk that none of us should run  --  the risk of being false to our ideal , " said Annie Weems . " Amritais a sort of Joan of Are . That girl has character . And she has good friends , who protect her . I suppose she is the only woman that ever lived who upset all the customs and traditions of a Hindu temple from the inside  --  mind you , from the inside . Nevertheless , I sometimes think the priests would die for her if necessary ; and I know that a number of Indian soldiers would . Of course she is in danger . She has beauty , talent , intellect-dangerous gifts , Mr. @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 've sold ' me . I ca n't wait to see her , " said Joe . Hawkes leaned forward . " Mr. Beddington , if you should care to come with me to-night , I 'll show her to you . I know her goings and comings  --  some of ' em  --  I know some . Shall I call for you ? " " You 're on . What time ? " " About a half-hour after dinner . " " I 'll be ready for you . Can you get two decent horses ? Bring ' em . " Joe offered the ayah ten rupees . She refused the money , biting her lip , turning her head the other way , with both hands clenched and her bare toes kneading at the clean New England rug . CHAPTER SIX " What 's the odds ? She 's harmless . " JOE always had hated to dine with his mother alone . Fortunately there was a bottle of not-so-bad Madeira . Joe 's mother drank two-thirds of it . Joe kept filling her glass ; she sometimes became @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pass opportunities to poison hope with cynicism . So he kept on pouring and did not even mention Annie Weems . There was a sort of silent laughter deep within him . Ile was so absorbed by his own line of thought that he had to jerk himself out of it to listen to his mother . It was never safe not to listen to her . " Mr. Cummings told me , by the way , that it 's useless to try to find the Wilburforce 's child . If she 's alive , which he doubts , she 'd be beyond hope of redemption  --  probably Mahommedan or Hindu , with three or four half-caste children of her own already and an inferiority complex like a stray cat 's . Ile says white children raised by natives in this climate lose all sense of honesty and moral stamina . She 'd be too old to be educated and too familiar with vice to be safe with anybody 's children . I ca n't see myself taking that sort of young person back to the States with us , even @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 'd better leave her to the gods , as Mr. Cummings phrased it . What do you propose to do to-night ? " " Moonlight sketches . " He said that through his teeth , with eyelids lowered . He cracked nuts swiftly , finding one at last that he could pass to her : " Here you are  --  all the way from Brazil  --  but do n't ask why . " He knew her capable , because she knew he loved sketching , of inventing something else for him to do  --  for instance , find a doctor for imaginary , 68BLACK LIGHT 69agonizing ailments . He had hard work not to betray relief when she seemed hardly to notice his answer  --  although he knew she weighed it and passed judgment on it before almost casually saying what , in turn , she wished him to believe . " I 'm so tired  --  I suppose I ought to go to bed . However , Mr. Cummings wants to show me photos of the Delhi Durbar , taken years ago . I think I 'll take the rickshaw @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was lying , although he had no doubt that Cummings wished to show his photographs . A creepy feeling down his spine warned him that she meant to make her own inquiries about the Wilburforce child and to set in motion means of legally disproving in advance the girl 's identity , in case she should turn up and prove embarrassing . Thoroughly , through and through , he understood his mother 's vanity and cruelty . The unfamiliar new laughter he had found within himselfmocked the very nervousness that caused it . He summoned the rickshaw , helped his mother into it and even delayed her by making her look at the violet mystery of shadows under the trees and on the compoundwall . " I 'd give a year 's salary to be able to get that color right with oil or pastel . " " You will be a fool with money to your dying day , " she retorted . " Do n't disturb me if you 're out late . I expect to return early and go straight to bed . Come to my room after @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , astride a Waler mare that he had borrowed , leading an Arab gelding . He was smoking his short pipe and there was about him an air of genial recklessness that was probably due to thoughts about the thousand pounds , but it suggested adventure and Joe 's mood grew luxuriously free from responsibility . He told himself he did not give a damn what happened that night . He ordered two whiskies and spilled his own in the dust while Hawkes drank . The Arab gelding moved with silky smoothness and70 BLACK LIGHTthe night was a-swim with impalpable dust made luminousby starlight . There were soft sounds at uncertain intervals , but for the most part a mystic silence envelopedeverything . It was another universe , in which anything might happen except the rational and real . It seemed comfortingly familiar , and his own voice sounded , friendly fashion , like the voice of some one else  --  some fellow full of confident amusement . He asked Hawkes the familiar question , that , from Greenwich Village to Darjiling , always crops up on a dark night amid @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ place where you knew you had never been before , yet the place was perfectly familiar and you recognized every detail of it ? " " Sure , sir , lots o ' times . Once when I went with a girl near Woking and we came to a clump o ' deodars . I had n't never been in India in those days . But I saw those deodars , and smelt ' ern , and I felt it was a place I 'd seen . I knew what was around the corner , so to speak , and where there was a waterfall  --  and mountains ' way away beyond it . Funny , ' cause there ai n't a waterfallnear Woking and the only thing that even hints at mountains is the Surrey Downs , about eight hundred feet high . Pretty soon I forgot it . She was a girl who made a man forget things  --  scrumptious , but too expensivefor a soldier 's income . And besides , I had to be back in barracks before midnight . Anyhow , I forgot them deodars . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of it ' ? " Joe rather resented sharing mystic interludes with Hawkes . He was half afraid the man would bring him back to earth with inane explanations . " This , sir : three years later I was in India , and I was always a one for getting myself transferred to places I 'm curious to see . That 's quite a trick . I 'm not a soldier , I 'm a tourist with a liking to have my expenses paid by Government . So , ' fore long , me and Simla makes acquaintance . Presently , ten days ' leave ; BLACK LIGHT 71and I go pony riding , acting nursemaid to a subaltern who wants to see the sights . The subaltern goes sick with collywobbles in his tummy along o ' being careless . Them IIills , as they call ' em , are tough on amateurs unless they watch their stummicks . Camp  --  and I 've time on my hands . A full moon  --  deodars  --  and I go walking . There she is ! The very sight I 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mist in a valley  --  everything . And mind you , I say , everything . There was a woman there , the very spitting image of the girl I 'd loved in Woking , only this one was n't white and could n't speak a word of any language I knew . But she knew me as sudden as I knew her , and we stood there grinning at each other until a savage with a long knife came and took her away , she looking back at me over her shoulder . How do you account for that , sir ? " " Ca n't . There 's no accounting for lots of things that happen . What 's the noise behind us ? " " Nothing but your bodyguard , I reckon . " Joe drew rein . A moment later the sound of patteringfootsteps ceased . He turned back , legged his horse into a shadow , stopped again to listen  --  heard labored breathing . Hawkes , drawing rein beside him , chuckled and lifted a heel to knock the ashes from his pipe . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nobody wo n't hurt you . " There was a moment 's pause and then the ayah stepped out from the darkness , followed after a moment by Chandri Lai . Iiawkes turned a pocket flashlight on the woman ; her breast was heaving and her nostrils trembled . " Ask what in hell does she follow me for ? " IIawkes spoke to her , but she merely looked dumbly determined , nervous grin and sulky defiance alternating . There was something about her that was irritating but nevertheless respectable . Joe felt toward her as he might toward an uninvited lost dog that had adopted him. 72 BLACK LIGHT " She wo n't let up , sir . Some people might try whipping her , but I 'm not that kind and I do n't think you are . We might gallop a bit , but we 'd only make her suffer . She 'd follow . She 'd track us . She 'd catch up . What 's the odds ? She 's harmless . " Joe tried English : " What do you want , Amal ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as he leaned back in the saddle to ease himself , discovered that the nurnnah was an over-size one that protruded about a foot behind the polo-saddle . It suggested a rather amusing notion . " Tell her , if she 's so set on following , I 'll save her all the trouble . She may climb up behind if she is n't afraid . " " She , sir  --  she 's afraid o ' nothing that 'd scare you and me . Her kind keep a whole seraglio of fears that could n't scare us in a month o ' Sundays . How about it , Mother ? " He translated Joe 's invitation . The ayah hesitated . Chandri Lal whispered  --  pushed her . The whites of the ayah 's eyes were like green glass in the glare of the flashlight . She struck Chandri Lal with her elbow to silence him , grinned  --  stepped up to Joe 's stirrup . Chandri Lal lent her the use of his shoulder . She was up behind Joe in a moment , gripping with strong legs that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe 's arm-pit that lay like a threat on his heart ; he could feel his heart beating beneath it . " Who said anything about you , you devil ? " Hawkes legged the Waler mare away from Chandri Lai . " Ca n't you take him up behind you ? " " He 's got them blasted cobras with him in a basket . I do n't know which gives me the creeps most , he or they . Besides , he do n't belong to her . He 's like a leech or a louse . He 's a blooming parasite , that 's what he is . He 's like one o ' them whimpering jackals that follow a tiger . " " Ask her if she wants him . " Hawkes asked . Joe could feel the ayah 's laughter ; BLACK LIGHT 73it was soundless but there was plenty of it . She spoke , though , with what sounded like anger . " She says he 's none o ' her business . " " Let 's go . " They began to trot @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in his teeth and one hand balancing the big flat basket on his turban . Ten minutes later , when they passed a pool of light that flowed from the open door of a Eurasian 's bungalow , he was still following , his bare feet padding silently in deep dust and the basket bobbing up and down like a piece of machinery . The warmth of the ayah 's body against Joe 's back excited him in a way that his brain could not analyze . She kept that left hand on his heart and her right hand on his shoulder . It was as if a current flowed between them  --  not of electricity  --  a current of thought . Partly , perhaps , because his mother , not he , possessed all the family wealth , he had often told himself that possessions do not constitute importance ; and as the arbiter of the destiny of hundreds of employees from vice-president downward he had very often in his own mind minimized his own importance , in order to avoid the stings of conscience on account of arbitrary cruelties @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ was only a cog in a huge machine . In theory he could readily agree with the doctrine that no individual is more important than another . Nevertheless , if he had occasion to pass judgment and act on it , he would have considered himself as a matter of fact a great deal more important than t lie ayah . He was now uncomfortably conscious of importancewhich , apparently , she had and he had not . 1 le could not have explained it . He was merely aware of a condition . Small groups of Eurasian loafers , and Hindus gathered in doorways or around flickering firelight ; their mocking , obscene laughter yelped at the sight of a sahib carrying a native woman up behind him . It was much too dark for any one to guess that she was old and74 BLACK LIGHTundesirable ; her figure was young ; as a silhouette observedagainst crimson bonfire-light , her bare legs dimly outlined on the horse 's flank and her right arm on his shoulder , she probably looked bacchanalian  --  beautiful  --  suggestive . However , he was defiant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ one of his own race , on whom his scorn would not be wasted . All the same , the ayah 's vibrant warmth and the pressure of her hand on his heart made him feel disturbed and unpleasantly creepy ; and for that reason , not because of onlookers , he wished he had told her to mount behind Hawkes . They skirted the small city , passing a slaughter-house where foul birds roosted restlessly along the ridge of a near-by roof . Then they turned to the right through mean streets , where men and women slept in sheeted rows on pallets on the sidewalk to avoid the infernal heat of the unventilated rooms . Just as the moon was rising a street widened , became near-respectable and flowed like a spreading estuary into a paved square that had flower-beds in the midst , and a fountain , and a few welltendedtrees . Along the far side was a high stone wall and a sentry-box to one side of an iron-bossed wooden gate that had spikes at the top . There was a roof behind the wall  --  a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . In moonlight it looked like the corpse of a roof . " What 's that place ? " " The jail , " Hawkes answered . He slowed to a walkingpace , and the ayah vaulted to the ground , as active as an ape ; Joe tried to see which way she went , but she vanished into shadow ; it was several seconds before he saw her running toward a group of people who appeared to be holding an argument within the shadow of the wall , beside the sentry-box . A small door in the wide gate opened and a man stepped out who seemed to be an officer . He shut the gate behind him . CHAPTER SEVEN " So you sing to them , eh ? " Now , by quite imperceptible stages , Joe changed  --  as a chrysalis does , only much more swiftly . He emerged out of a state of consciousness into another one , in which values were not the same , and he was not the same Joe Beddington . The strangest part of that was , that he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the moon coming over the wall of the jail . Then Hawkes took both the horses and tied their bridles to a god 's leg on the fountain in the center of the square , so that they could drink all they pleased and make confessionafterward , if they should happen to feel sinful . Hawkes made a more or less obvious and rather bawdy joke about that . The joke hardly penetrated Joe 's thought ; however , he laughed politely and set foot across the square in something of a hurry , trying to conceal his haste . He felt curious and queerly excited . There were seven or eight native Indian soldiers  --  tall bearded shadows , standing around some sort of Eurasian official , who was insisting on talking English to establish his importance ; further to establish it , he was wearing his white sun-helmet in the moonlight . The man who belonged in the sentry-box was standing , lookingnervous , with his back to the small open door in the big shut gate , through which the undersized Eurasian had come . Joe 's first @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ abortive attempt at one . But before he had come close enough to hear what any one was saying  --  even the annoyed Eurasian was speaking in undertones  --  he heard a girl 's voice . She was singing . She was somewhere in the jail yard , out of sight . Joe had heard all the imported voices and knew enough7576 BLACK LIGHTmusic to confess to himself that he might be fooled a little by the mellow moonlight and by the weird state of his nerves , but he knew that what he heard had quality . He had to stand still and listen  --  so intently that he did not notice whether the Indian soldiers and the Eurasian went on arguing or not ; and he became oblivious of Hawkes . The song was in some Indian language , of which he knew no word . But he could recognize tone when he heard it . IIe himself had perfect pitch . He might have followed music , if his mother had not had too much money . He told himself that he had never heard quite such quality in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He stood still , spellbound , something happening within him that he could neither analyze nor measure . It was a mystic moment  --  the sort when bankers make their big mistakes and men of destiny march toward Waterloo . There was a winelike inspiration of the kind that goes to Kaisers ' heads and makes nursemaids yield themselves to soldiers in psychic ecstasy that the soldier mistakes for worship of himself . The mellow moonlight and the pastel-shaded shadows were the sort that make a Swinburne write odes to Revolution , or a Tennyson write idylls to the King . Joe felt , for the first time in his whole experience , a mood that some men can only attain by getting drunk  --  a mood that drink destroys in other men . To use his own phrase , he felt like old-man Abraham on camel-back , aloof from earth , conscious of incomprehensible destiny , borne forward , he knew not whither . Meanwhile , his feet rang solidly on paving stones . Seven soldiers and a scared Eurasian , mistaking him for a British officer on a tour @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ attention . Even when he drew near and it was seen he was not in uniform the tenseness was not relaxed , there being no accounting in the native mind for the peculiarities of British method , that seems to consistso often in having no method at all ; he might beBLACK LIGHT 77a new arrival with mysterious authority , snooping like IIaroun-al-Raschid in mufti in quest of embarrassing facts for the morning 's session of the court . He might be that most awful of enormities , an officer on secret service . The man with his back to the open door presentedarms with a rattle of carbine swivels . Joe waited for revelation . And it came , of course , from the Eurasian , who saw Hawkes ' uniform approachingand was sure now that Joe was an official personage . " She sings , sir . " " So I notice . " " Sir , Mr. Cummings gave strict orders there should be no visitors at night . Nevertheless , she comes . She sings . What can I do ? " " Why does she sing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Sir , she makes song to the prisoners . Mr. Cummings gave such strict orders I am afraid now there will be an inquiry and we shall all be punished . Sir , will you not speak to her and " Hello ! " It was hardly a startling voice . It was too exactly in the middle of F-major and too bell-like to have anything unpleasant about it , but it produced silence in the way the backstage gong does when the curtain goes up on the drama . Joe only had to turn his head a little to the left and he did it almost stealthily , as if he were trespassingand hoped to see unseen . He was not scared . IIe could not have explained his attitude . He saw the black-robed ayah , like a shadow , glide past him and be swallowed in the darkness by the corner of the sentrybox . Framed in the gap in the gate , with moonlight on the white wall of the jail behind her causing a sort of luminescentaura , stood a girl with a chaplet of flower-buds @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ cloak that was thrown back carelessly she wore a lowneckedgarment of cloth-of-gold . There was a girdle at her waist that appeared to be made of gold wire woven78 BLACK LIGHTinto the form of a serpent with jeweled eyes . She had bracelets that clashed , and something gleamed on her ankle . Iler bare feet looked like living marble . One hand resting on the edge of the doorway , she stood with the grace of a water-carrier , one foot on the door-sill . " Hello , Hawkesey . " The Eurasian interrupted : " Miss , please tell this gentleman I did my utmost  --  yes , indeed , my utmost to prevent your going in . " " Should he know ? Do you wish him to think you cruel ? " " Miss , my job to me is not a joke , it is my daily bread . And my honor " Hawkes interrupted . " Miss Amrita , this is Mr. Beddington . " She bowed , almost imperceptibly , the motion making the moonlight on her hair wave slightly as it does on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . She walked straight up to Joe and shook hands with him . IIer hand was the most magnetic thing he had ever touched and she seemed in no haste to withdraw it . The sensation was of being touched by some one in a dream . She moved like some one in a dream . She was gentle , faintly scented with some mysterious eastern stuff that smelled dew o ' the morning clean . Joe let her lead him out into moonlight , where he really saw her for the first time as she turned her head to speak abruptly to the ayah . She had the marvelous rhythmic movement of an animal , such as even the most perfect dancers have only rarely , and as she turned her head the moonlight made a silver line along her neck that was almost maddening , it was so beautiful . The ayah slunk again into a shadow . " You are not here by accident . Why did you come to see me ? " she asked . " How do you know I am not here by accident @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ pleased to see me . Why ? " BLACK LIGHT 79He answered lamely . " Why were you singing in there ? " " Why not ? " " If I heard correctly , it 's against the rules . " " Whose rules ? Yours ? God 's ? " Indignation , whether it was true or simulated made her lovelier than ever . Joe 's impulse was to sketch her , with her shadow willowingbeyond her on the mouse-gray paving-stone ; but his left fist , obeying instinct , remained clenched behind his back , expressing disbelief in beauty as a mark of virtue , viewed from the banker 's angle . Ile was conscious of Ilawkes . He had a business man 's distaste for being compromised by a woman before witnesses . Habit , instinct , training told him to go away before trouble began . " Why should you sing at night ? " he asked her . Her voice changed to the soft , persuasive , reasonable note one uses to a child who ca n't grasp principles : " Were you ever in prison ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sleepless hours are like to men born in the open , who have lived with sky-room for their thoughts ? They wall them in . They roof them in . They shut out the wonderful wind of the night that whispers of friendly familiar scenes . They shut out moonlight , starlight  --  and they say to them , Be honest men , such as we are , who have stolen all God 's goodness from you because you stole some devil 's trash from us ! ' " So you sing to reduce their agony ? " She nodded . " And a spiritless official who , I dare say , thinks that toothache is worse than a broken spirit , says I may not sing ! " " And you defy him ? I can sympathize . But are n't you defying Bumbledom in general ? The man is backed up by society . He has to be obeyed . " " Has he ? If he forbade me to give alms  --  or to smile  --  or to bless all earth with every breath I breathe , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " But lie 's responsible for the prisoners . " " True ! And the Lords of Life will hold the fool responsible ! They will demand of him those prisoners ' hearts that he is breaking . But they shall not accuse me of neglecting to sing . In that prison are thieves , murderers , quarrelsome men , debtors , weaklings who have taken others ' blame , and some who are in no way guilty of the charge against them . By day they have a little work to do that keeps their hearts from bursting . But at night , in the dark , and no stars ? I come and I let the starlight melt me , I flow along my voice into their poor dumb hearts , so that for at least a little while they think of love instead of hatred . Do you think I would dare to obey that fool when he says I shall not ? Will he dare to attempt to prevent me ? If he does dare , let him answer for it to the Lords of Life , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " That was over Joe 's head . He had sent cigarettes to an ex-vice-president of a bank in prison for defalcation , and had thought rather well of himself for doing it , but he had never even pondered whether Shakespeare meant what he was saying about music having charm . When he had thought of it at all , which was hardly ever , he thought that a prison should be as nearly hell as human ingenuity could make it  --  short , of course , of actual savagery or neglect . People should keep out of prison . " How did you come by your name ? " he asked her . " I took it . Out of all the names there are , in all the languages I know , I liked that name best . So I took it  --  just the way a crow steals anything it wants . It probablybelonged to some one else , but there it was . I took it . " " What does the name mean ? " " Daybreak . " " Dawn ? " " Daybreak @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ bursts my heart unless I become  --  do  --  act  --  instead of sitter ! sill . BLACK LIGHT 81 " I like that . " " Do you ? You wo n't like it when your own break through begins ! I mean , when it really begins . You have been incubating quite a long time . Which hen sat on you ? " Joe smiled . " Do I seem such a desperate chicken as that ? " " Eaglet , " she answered . " Flatterer ! " " You do n't know me . And you wo n't like it when you feel your feathers quilling out . Ask Hawkesey . He got incubated , and he did n't like it either . Hawkesey got drunk and then tried to get sent to a war where Hillmen rub the ends off bullets to make sure of killing . You may talk of killing yourself , to yourself ; but you will think like dynamite ; and when you go off , some one  --  who is it , I wonder ?  --  will have to get @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Jupiter , Mars and Saturn all in Gemini . " " You 're right . But is n't astrology rather piffle ? " " Yes , but so would mathematics be if they taught you twice five are eleven . Calling things piffle wo n't take the Jupiter influence out of your life . " Joe did not care to argue about astrology . " Who taught you such good English ? " he asked . " I never learned any bad English until I talked to an Englishman . There was almost a war between Iawkesey and me to see which could corrupt the other . I t was funny . I liked the swear words , and that shocked him , because Hawkesey is a Puritan underneath the surface . He began to try to talk like an officer with a hot potato in his mouth and half his syllables missing . So I swore each time he mispronounced a word , and I had to swear so often that he went away all alone and practised how to speak , in order to save my soul from hell @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you consider yourself an Indian ? " " Funny . Hawkesey asked that question the first82 BLACK LIGHTday he met me . Is a bird in an oven a cake ? Because I am caged in India , am I Indian ? My friends are Indian , if you mean by that that they were born here . But so was I. I have the kindest friends that were ever patient with a strange bird in their high nest . It was so high in the treetops that I used to be afraid of falling out , particularly when the wind blew . But they taught me to fly . And I have flown . And I have brought back food for them . " " Do you know who your father and mother were ? " " Yes . Amal told me . It was sweet of them to bring me to be born in India . They must have been lovely people ; so I suppose the Lords of Life let them go as soon as I was born . They may have had trouble enough , and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ destiny take its course . They might have tried to struggle against destiny ; and I think they were n't the kind of people who deserve such torture . So they were let die very swiftly . And I dare say the darlings thought dying was dreadful , until they found themselves out of their bodies . " " Do you believe in an after-life ? " She chuckled . " Who wants to believe in anything ? I insist on knowing . Do n't you ? " " Do n't let 's talk philosophy . " " You could n't . You do n't know any  --  yet . That shocks you , does n't it ! You have read Bergson , I suppose , and Kant , and Spencer , and William James  --  a little Aristotle  --  babies , all of them ! " " How do you know ? " " I too have read them . How else should I know ? They are babies arguing in three dime : aons , although if they would stop for a minute to tl : , , : @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of dimensions they are pretty conscious of at least five . However , philosophersdo n't think ; it is not respectable . Some day one of the Gods will throw an apple at tl:erg- , . , as was done at Newton . Then they will wake up , one by one . " BLACK LIGHT 83 " Where are you going ? " Joe asked . " Home . " " May I see Trou home ? " " No , it would offend my escort . They are gentlemen who have foregone sleep after a long day 's soldiering merely because it pleases them to protect my dignity , as they express it . I must snub you rather than offend them . Life is a matter of choosing between predica-ments . " " May I see you again ? " " How can you avoid that , if that is destined ? " " You believe in destiny ? " " It makes no difference to destiny whether we believe or not . But you do n't believe ? Then why not try going away ? There are @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ airplanes . Take one . Then you will soon know whether destiny has other intentions . " " You advise that ? " " Why not ? It wo n't hurt you . Good night . " He thought her parting smile was wistful , although he was not sure . She and sadness seemed to have no bond in common , and yet  --  perhaps it was his own lack of pleasure in life that made him see her through a sad lense . Or perhaps it was moonlight . He could feel his heart thumping and it made him angry ; he was a roaster of men and millions , not a silly emotional ass to be stirred out of , his proper orbit by a girl 's smile . Ile wondered what color her eyes were . How little and light she looked ; how tall and graceful when the ayah followed and touched her sari that she wore like a Roman toga ; how small when the seven-man escort formed up 1 wo by two and tramped behind her , one man grunting gruff commands and giving @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ! Probably a thousand pounds or so of bearded bone and muscle , fit to fight its weight in anything that breathed . Tamed by a girl who walked like something flowing in the moonlight . " Guess I 'm going crazy . " 84 BLACK LIGHTJoe turned about , and found Hawkes facing him . The jail door was shut and the sentry was pacing his beat with shouldered carbine . Chandri Lai , sweating and breathing heavily , drew near and squatted with his basket in front of Joe . " How do you like her ? " Hawkes asked . " She 's surprising . What does that fool want now ? " " Nothing  --  I mean anything . Shall I kick him ? " " No . Tell him to go to the devil . " Joe strode to where the horses waited with their reins tied to a grinning god 's leg by the fountain . In the shadow beneath the Waler 's belly the ayah crouched , shrugging herself . " Damn you , " he told her , " you stink and you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ harmony . Go home . Do you hear me ? Beat it ! " But the ayah watched dumbly until he swung himself into the saddle ; and when he rode away she followed , like a good dog padding , uncomplaining , in the dust . CHAPTER EIGHT " Do I get my money ? " JoE 's first reaction took the form of anger against I-Iawkes and Annie Weems . To have allowed a white girl to be brought up by Indian priests seemed to him criminal . To have contributed toward her education without denouncing the arrangement was conspiracy . Money-hunger , no doubt . Educate the girl to have contempt for money ; then , when she comes of age and gets some , make her sign it all away before she wakes up . Old game . That 's the way religious institutions grow rich . Disappointment  --  no money after all  --  all right  --  beautiful , is n't she ?  --  marry her off to some fat scoundrel who will pay a stiff price . " Are you satisfied , sir ? " Hawkes , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , full in Hawkes ' face was like a Broadwayspotlight advertising the price at which a commodityis practically given . away  --  a thousand pounds  --  dirt cheap  --  and convenient easy payments if preferred . Commodity , however , rather evasively guaranteed . " Satisfied of what ? " " Of Of her identity . Do I get my money ? " The sleepy Arab stumbled on a loose stone hidden in the dust , causing Joe to bite off the first few syllables of his answer : "  --  see mother about it . " " All right , sir . " Joe began to wonder what he should say to his mother . If he had had a thousand pounds of his own money he would probably have paid Hawkes there and then . But his mother 's habit was to make Joe pay the expenses out of his quite moderate income and to take her time before she reimbursed him  --  a system thoroughly char-8586 BLACK LIGIITacteristic of her . It enabled her to know what he did with his income ; when he needed money he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ submit to lectures on extravagance . Of course , he had a big letter of credit with him , but if he drew against that his mother would know in no time . He might give Hawkes a check on a New York bank and write a letter asking the bankers to pay the check on presentation . But Hawkes would probably not know how to handle such a check and would almost certainly take it either to a native banker or to one of his officers , either of whom would start gossip circulating . Lees of Joe 's many suppressions were boiling up and their fumes half-blinded him . The midnight of his discontent was worse than its moonless gloom had been . He had seen a new moon  --  come to think of it , the new moon was a suggestive symbol of her  --  beautiful  --  emergingsuddenly out of obscurity after nights of darkness . And the glimpse had only made him feel more miserable . When they reached the hotel he was curt and something less than decently polite ; he threw the reins to Hawkes @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ his room . " See you some time to-morrow . " He had a cot on the verandah on the side of the hotel that faced a line of low hills ; there was nothing very alluring about them by full moonlight ; they suggested to Joe 's mind dry bones of monsters that died of weariness . He turned his back to them and lay facing the wall , cursing the stuffy mosquito net that smelled of sour dust . Sleep repudiated him . He lay thinking , and his thought was broken into instalments by the gusts of native servants ' snoring and the irritating , hysterical barks of a jackal fossicking for filth . He wished he had stayed in New York  --  wished he had done anything but come to India . He began to hate his mother , not because he thought the effort worth while but because it kept a more importantthought veiled in the background ; and he underBLACKLIGHT 87stood perfectly , too , that hatred of his mother was merely a form of self-contempt in a particularly ugly mask . He told himself , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ if he were a man he would have cut adrift from his mother long ago ; a man who would endurewhat he did for a pittance of fifteen thousand a year and the prospect of inheriting control of millions was not a real man , he was a coward  --  a spineless nincompoop . Nevertheless , although he writhed at his own accusation while he let its lash bite inward , he knew , but refused to admit , its gross unfairness . No son of his mother , tutored and dragooned from infancy by her , could escape from her toils without violence . She was a Clytemnestra , only to be overcome by being slain . Nero did it . Joe was no Nero , and he had no desire to be one . Moonlight helped him to imagine endless ramificationsof that theme , including theories of poetic justice , easier to contemplate than to believe really possible . At three in the morning , by the alarm-clock of the man who had to take the mail-bag to the so-called midnighttrain , he sat up in a long-armed chair @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to that strange encounter near the prison gate . Even indignation at his mother failed to blot Amrita 's image from his mind . The color of her eyes still baffled him . The instant he let his thought have rein she sprang to life in his imagination , color , line and gesture . He had the artist 's faculty of summoning from vacancy a thing once seen . Ile could have drawn her there and then . His long strong fingers itched to do it , as they had never itched for money or for anything else he could remember . It was rather a shock to discover what an inroad she had made into his consciousness . Perhaps surprise accounted for it ; she was so totally different from any one he had supposed she might resemble . He yielded only very gradually , thought by thought , until he admitted to himself at last that she had made an impression on him far too deep to be accounted for by logical analysis. 88 BLACK LIGHTHe liked her . He liked her strangely . He liked her far more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ liked any one at first sight . He liked her so much that it made him angry to include her in the same thought with his mother . What , he wondered , would his mother do with herif  --  if  --  ifhis mother ever learned of her existence . Instantly , he knew his mother would begin to sharpen strategy . His mother had imagined some one of the " Orphant-Annie " type , who might be broken to her will and added to the list of sycophants . She would no more tolerate her as a high-spirited , intelligent and independentprotegee than an old she-wolf will tolerate a new young female in the lair ; her fangs might be better concealed than a wolf 's and not so sudden , but they would be much more cruel . Well , it was none of his business . But that thought made him restless . He could make it his business , could n't he ! Should he permit his mother to ruin that bright young girl , simply because she had dared to meet her son by moonlight and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Here was once when his mother should be outmaneuvered . But how ? Why tell her ? Why not pull out on the afternoon train ? Why not leave Amrita to the gods , as Cummingshad suggested  --  futile fool ! He hated to adopt that tame cat 's flatulent suggestion , but it seemed the best one after all . Joe had seen too many people ruined by his mother 's malice . He had rescued a few , although he had to do it treacherously , dropping warning hints that always were interpreted as glimpses of his own infernalcunning . It was no wonder the people he saved never liked him afterward  --  no wonder he had so few friends  --  such a host of discreet acquaintances . Well , this could be one time when his mother need not know a thing about his strategy . Neither need the potential victim know . IIe would run no risks . He would never see the girl again and she should neverBLACK LIGHT 89guess who ' , he was or how close she had come to the claws of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ himself . " Ogress ? By God , I believe that 's what mother actually is . Catherine of Russia  --  Catharine de Medici  --  those two were gentle sheep compared to Kitty Beddington . " IIe would write Hawkes a draft for a thousand pounds  --  say for five thousand dollars , payable on presentation in New York . He would hand it to him , to hold his tongue . He would get Hawkes ' written promise , ever more to hold his tongue . Hawkes would be afraid to talk until the draft was paid ; payment might be stopped by cablegram unless the stipulation about silence was fulfilled . Meanwhile he would send a cablegram in code to New York and get the office to summon him home . His mother would have to go home too . He liked the program. , and the thought of home was pleasant in his psychic nostrils ; so that when morning came he shaved with some contentment , whistled in his bath , dressed without as much as noticing the yelloweyedservant who got in his way , packed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ swearing at the waiter . Then he went for a ride on a hotel hack to kill time until the ogress should be up and on the war-path . The word ogress amused him . Funny that he had not thought of her before in that light . The word unaccountably clipped her sting  --  clipped off the worst of it ; he feared her far less as an ogress than as a natural human being . There was somethingeven comical about the word . It rather annoyed him to see the ayah , lean and tirelessbut a little sulky-looking , climb to high ground whence , he supposed , she intended to watch him . It annoyed him more to notice Chandri Lal with a basket cal ' snakes on his head come trotting behind in the dust . Ire afforded Chandri Lal some exercise by cantering the raw-boned hack for several miles and returning to the hotel by a different route , remembering legends about90 BLACK LIGHTIndians hounding people to their death by merely followingthem  --  following  --  saying nothing . As he neared the hotel he began to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to complete the business with him before train-time . He had a proper speech all set for IIawkes ; what with that , and the quiet conceit that he was planning the most gentlemanly action of his life  --  he was feeling in fine humor . So it rather dashed his spirits to see Chandri Lal and the ayah sitting side by side , a yard or two apart , beneath a tree in the hotel compound ; they appeared to be laughing  --  perhaps at the snake-charmer 's knowledge of short-cuts across country , or perhaps at that other unpleasantly ominous sight that greeted him . Hawkes on a good-looking horse with a pipe in his mouth was riding away from the hotel ; Joe 's mother was up and having breakfast on the verandah instead of in her room . There were three crows on the verandah railing . Three crows . Joe 's instantly assumed air of nonchalance did not deceive his mother for a moment , any more than her wave of the hand and invitation to what she called coffee deceived him . It was some sort @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ as his greeting and hers . There was war between them , for the thousandth time , and both knew it , although both concealed it , as he sat down to sip at the Borgian brew that his mother mixed for him with her own bejeweled fingers . " Did you enjoy your ride , my boy ? " " No , Mother . " He forgot he had enjoyed it . Even had he not forgotten , he would probably have lied . He was halfpanicky . Rebellion had come . He , Joe Beddington , had raised his standard , secretly as yet , but with a determination that seemed , even to him , out of all proportion to the issue ; and he hardly knew yet what the issue was . " Did you make nice sketches last night ? " BLACK LIGHT- 91 " No . Mother , why stay on in this infernal hole ? Let 's go . I 've packed my trunk . Let 's take the afternoontrain . " IIe hit something and she almost blinked ; but she was as skilful @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ voice was pitched a half-note lower than the normal , with its harshness in abeyance . " Joe , dear , I have made all sorts of plans to photographthe caverns near here . I have even wired for an electric-light plant . " " Wire and cancel it then . Here  --  I 'll send for a blank  --  I ' 11 write it for you . " " No , Joe . Mr. Cummings has arranged for coolies and all kinds of assistance . He has even set men exploringto find passages that may have been forgotten for centuries . Even if I did n't wish to make the photographs , I ca n't be rude to Mr. Cummings . " " I 've known you rude enough when it suited you to be . Mother  --  why waste time on this damned wildernesswhen India is chock-a-block with things worth seeing ? Order your electric-light plant shipped to ltenares . There 's a place worth photographing . " " No , Joe , every one has done Benares . Here I 've a chance to get something unique . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's tomb ! At least I 'll have photos that no one else can duplicate . " Neither of them even hinted at what was uppermost in both minds . Each knew that the other was masking the real objective . Habit lay strong on Joe ; in the face of firm finality , as usual , he blustered to cover his search to discover an opening on the flank of the positiontactics taught him by his mother , and that she understood and read as swiftly as if he personally had explainedthem to her . " Look here , Mater . " It was always mater , not mother , when Joe was angry . " I came on this idiotic tour to oblige you . I 've put up with all the boredom of it , and I 've done my best to see that you got all the92 BLACK LIGHTenjoyment possible . Now it 's no more than fair that you should move on to oblige me .

" Skilfully she heaped a little fuel on his fire . " Joe , dear , Mr. Cummings is very interesting . " She knew exactly what he thought of Cummings . " That ass ! " She incited him a little further ; he was check-mate now in one move : " If you were n't so self-opinionated you could improveyour mind and learn a great deal by studying Mr. Cummings ' methods of administration . There is always something to be learned , everywhere . And with Mr. Cummings so obliging and willing to Joe exploded . " Damn Cummings ! The very sight of him upsets me . Pompous imbecile ! If he were any one , at his age he would n't be relegated to obscurity in a jerk-water hole like this .

Kiss Cummings on both cheeks and promise to send him some picture post-cards . " " Very well , Joe . You take the afternoon train and amuse yourself somewhere else . I 'll stay on here and take my photographs . I think you 're right . You 're suffering from boredom . You go . I 'll stay . " Check-mate ! He knew now , IIawkes had told her about Amrita . He had been willing to leave the girl in the lap of the gods , as Cummings phrased it ; but to his mother 's machinations  --  not exactly ! Under his mother 's calmly observant eyes he instantly maneuvered to recover lost ground : " Nonsense , Mater ! How can I go and leave you here ? " " I am not exactly helpless , Joe . I even managedBLACK LIGHT 93nicely before you were born . It was n't you who taught me how many beans make five . " " I suppose you would like to be able to throw in my teeth for ever afterward that I left you on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " " Mr. Cummings is at least a gentleman . I think you had much better take the afternoon train , and not let Mr. Cummings hear you talk to me like that . Where do you propose to go from here ? " Joe ignored the question . Exasperated , he launched another  --  a shot at random : " Been talking to Cummingsabout me , have you ? I suppose he told you I should have gone to an English public school . " " Is there anything more natural than that I should talk about you ? " she retorted . " I do n't discuss you with strangers . " He knew he often did ; and she , too , knew it . " Why not ? Are you ashamed of your mother ? " He recognized defeat . He accepted it there and then by reaching for his hat and stalking off to chew the cud of solitary discontent . Defeat pro tem , at all events . And not one word , by either of them , about Amrita who was uppermost in both @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ book . " JoE was usually most unhappy when his mother was most in her element . What amused her made him miserable . IIe could endure her , even if he did not like her , when she was frankly predatory , taking what she could because the law was too ill-served to interfere . But when she talked high altruism while she did damned cruelty , he hated her . His brain groped blindly for the opposite of what she would expect him to do  --  some move that she would not understand . IIe thought of and found he could not dismiss from his mind the Yogi by the temple wall . Calling himself an idiot for his pains , he hired a horse and cantered to the temple , knowing it was out of bounds without a permit or an official escort ; but at that , he supposed he had escort enough ; the ayah and Chandri Lal pursued him , dodgingthrough traffic , taking short-cuts , stealing rides on motor-wagons ; whenever he glanced backward one or the other was not very far behind him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The old man 's eyes shone in the darkness , though his shape was hardly visible ; his nose looked beaklike and his beard was the shape of a gray owl 's body . Wondering how to open up a conversation Joe fetched a stone and sat on it before the hut door , so that he could peer upwardand seem not too disrespectful . For a long time then he waited for the Yogi to say something , but the silence only deepened as the minutes marched . " Old man , " he began at last in his friendliest voice , " I am sorry I was rude to you the other night . " " Rudeness is a consequence of ignorance . Of what are you afraid ? " " How do you know I 'm afraid ? " 94BLACK LIGHT 95 " Are you a special sort of book that none may read ? " " If you can read so well , then turn a page or two and tell me what you see , " Joe suggested . There was silence again for so @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in the gloom within the hut he would have thought the old man was asleep . He was about to repeat the question when the answer came : " What did I call you ? And what did I tell you ? " " You called me a man from Jupiter . And you told me I stand on a threshold . " " Should I say it again ? " " You might explain it . " Another silence . Then at last : " If I explain , will you believe ? Not so . Three thoughts will seize on your imagination : that I am mad  --  that I have designs on your purse , perhaps by subtle byways of intrigue  --  that I flatter my own vanity by claiming understanding that I have not . Thereafter your credulity will fluctuate between those three thoughts , accepting first the one and then the other . But the truth will escape you alto-gether . " Joe pondered what to say to that ; the ancient offered no suggestions . It was true , he was not a believer in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ intensely curious . " Suppose I agree not to doubt your honesty , " he suggested . " Are you a master of doubt ? Can you order its goings and comings ? How shall you agree to what you know not how to fulfil ? " " All right . Suppose I say this then : I will use my best judgment and try to believe you . " " Would that be good judgment ? It is written on your face as plain as writing in a book , that you have been taught to disbelieve all that is told you . " " Taught  --  yes . But I have never fully learned it . For instance , I do n't doubt your honesty . " " You ere n fool then . Great liars are they who claim96 BLACK LIGHTthey are honest . Honorable , yes , a man may be  --  but honest , not yet  --  not for a few thousand million eternities , and not then without striving . Worse liars  --  mean , immodest dogs are they who yelp their scorn at the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ better to make mistakes than not to make them . " " How so ? I 'm a banker , for instance , among other things . " " And have the bankers learned by making no mistakes ? Do you know the history of banking ? Is there one thing that they knew and fully understood in the beginning ? Is there one thing they have learned by any other means than by mistakes ? I tell you , no man learns by any other means . And by that means I learned silence when young fools come to me for readings of their plainly written destiny . Read thou thine own book . " " Naturally , if I could I 'd do it . " " Learn ! It is excellent knowledge . " " Are you subtly kidding me , I wonder ? You look like Diogenes under a barrel , and you 've come near sellinn me a line of goods I never thought I 'd fall for in a thousand years . Dammit , I 'll bite ! I 'll trust you . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " If I trust a man , I trust him . " " That is the excellent way to make mistakes , since trust adds keenness to the later disillusion . Not the wisest man knows very much , and he who volunteers advice knows very little . Nevertheless the biggest fool is he who blames another whose advice he took . " Joe grew determined . " Do you refuse advice when you are asked for it ? " " What is your security ? Does your bank lend money to each would-be borrower ? If I should give advice , as you call it , then I am lending knowledge . Can you guarantee to spend that knowledge wisely ? And if not , what then ? When the Examiner examines my account , how shall I answer his accusation that I loaned goodBLACK LIGHT 97knowledge for an unwise purpose ? He will hold me answerable . " " Can you profit by keeping all your wisdom to yourself ? " Joe retorted . " What 's the good of it , if you do n't share @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . " Are there not rules for the lending of money ? I tell you , there are far more certain rules for the employment of wisdom , and a mistakeis much more costly . " " Maybe . But you said just now that it 's better to make mistakes than not to make them . " " True . You are a man from Jupiter . There is no refusing you . Very well , I will make a mistake . I will answer one question . What is it you wish to know ? " Joe hesitated . He knew what he wanted to ask , but he was doubtful how to phrase it . Iie suspected the Yogi would evade him with vague generalities unless he cut the issue fine , with diamond distinctness . On the other hand , his intuition warned him not to he too personal , since it was after all a point of principle that troubled him , and once a principle is grasped it is no great problemto apply it . " One question and one answer , " said the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I want to make sure you understand me . " " Use ten words . " " It ca n't be done . I doubt that I could state it in a hundred words . It 's so complicated . " " Nothing is complicated , except folly . I know the question . " " Impossible . How can you know it ? " " You wish to know whether that threshold , whereuponI told you that you stand , if crossed will lead to freedom . Is that it ? " " That 's only part of it . " That is the whole of it . But the answer will seem to have three parts , though they are one in essence . " " Go on . I 'm listening . " 98 BLACK LIGHT " It will lead to strife with one . It will cause you to put warfare in another 's heart . It will lead to greater freedom than you ever dreamed of if  --  I say if you have manhood enough and march forward . " " You 're too vague . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with my mother ? " " Why not ? Can you break her hold otherwise ? " " I 'd give a lot to know how you read my history . However , all right , that 's that . Does the warfare that you say I shall cause in another person 's heart concern that girl Amrita ? " " Why not ? When the ayah asked , did I not speak of it ? " " I think I understand what you mean by the threshold . I have reached the stage where I ca n't stand being owned and used . But what if I refuse to cross the threshold ? It is n't too late to turn back . " " Cowardice seems comforting to some  --  until it bears its fruit . " " Would I not be justified in refusing to turn against my mother ? " " If you wish , you may continue to contribute to her sin until the sin destroys you both . In the end , what would she or you gain by it ? " " I 've reasoned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ than I did . All right , I can face that issue ; there 'll be hell to pay , but I guess it 's the only manly thing to do . I 'll cross that bridge and burn the blasted thing behind me . " " That is for you to decide . " " I 've made up my mind . But how about making trouble for that girl Amrita ? She never harmed me . What right have I to interfere with her ? " " Can you avoid it ? Can one man 's prayers for a longer night prevent the sun from rising ? " " That sounds like fatalism . " " To a fool 's ears ! Idiot ! When a promissory note is due , is it not due and payable ? Is it not timed ? AndBLACK LIGHT 99does the interest not accumulate , with added penalties ? Shall the creditor not collect it or else throw the debtor into bankruptcy ? And though the debtor forgets the note , can he deny he signed it ? Stands his signature not written @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Are your ears deaf and your eyes blind ? " " I do n't get the drift of your argument . " " Ass ! You sleep and wake ; you wake and sleep ; you see day follow night , and night the day ; you have seen old men die , and young ones born . Is it not clear to you then that we die and live , and live and die ? I tell you we are reborn millions of times . And what we owe to one life we shall repay , either in that life or another . Each deed done is nothing but a promissory note to meet its consequences . When it falls due , call it destiny and meet it with determination to pay it and set new , sweeter consequences forming ; or call it fate and fall beneath it and be rolled on . Each one 's destiny is his own , to make or unmake as he pleases . " " Do you mean you think I owe that girl a debt ? " " Or she you . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ both pay  --  as it will make me pay for wasting wisdom on a blind fool ! You have asked . I have answered . Now pay me in the coin of courtesy by getting hence . I have more profitable thoughts to think , and there are only a few eternities in which to think them . Go . You may spare your pride . You need not bow to the earth or call me Holy One . " CHAPTER TEN " India would be all right if it were n't for rajahs . " JoE spent the remainder of the day searching after a fashion for Hawkes , but nobody seemed to know where Hawkes was . He inquired at the officers ' mess of an Indian cavalry regiment ; Captain Bruce , who received him , sent an orderly to make inquiries , but the orderly came back none the wiser . " Are you in a hurry ? " Bruce asked . " Then why not ride the rounds with me ? We 'll run across him somewhere . " The aroma of many millions of dollars @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " If you 'd care to ride back here afterward and have lunch with me  --  perhaps I 'd better tell the butler now  --  we do n't have many visitors  --  the rogue might have to open tinned atrocities unless I warn him in advance . " The subject of Hawkes served well enough as an open wedge into conversation . " Ilawkes been making himself useful to you ? That 's his specialty . Hawkes is probably unique in all the armies of the world . He could drive a herd of sheep through a gap in the King 's Regulations that a practised lawyer could n't see , and he can make himself so useful that nobody ever calls him a loafer and sends him back to his regiment . I think his regiment has probably forgotten him . If we should be ordered to Tibet I 'd expect to find Hawkes ahead of us in Lhassa with a document of some sort proving he had the right to be there and draw extra pay for doing things that are n't provided for in the Regulations . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is that he 's in the secret service ? " " No , I think not . You see , a secret service man goes where he 's sent , but Hawkes goes where he pleases. 100BLACK LIGHT 101He 's a genius , and something of a joke . A good part of his secret is that the natives like him . He has a gift that is n't tact exactly , it 's a sort of fluid understanding crossed on to a lack of prejudice and a rare quick trick of learning a language while another man waits for a text-book . In addition to that the man 's a mine of information . Ask Hawkes if you want to know anything . And by the way , he 's a magician when it comes to skin wounds . Nobody knows how he does it , but he can stitch a wound and leave no scar whatever . Who is that woman , I wonder , and why is she following ? " Chandri Lai , too , was less than fifty yards away but Joe said nothing . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ mine of information , although there seemed to be no particular reason why it should disturb him . What if Hawkes had told about Amrita ? Why should he not tell , and what harm could come of it ? At any rate , it ought to be easy to discover whether he had or had not told . " Has any European ever been into that enormous temple ? " he asked . " I imagine not . We let temples severely alone . In other words , we let ' em run their own idolatries to suit ' emselves . " " No inspection of any kind ? " " None that I ever heard of . " " I saw the procession the other night . Worth seeing . But I 've wondered once or twice since then whether there was anything in my impression that there might be a white girl or two among those nautch-girls . " " Oh , no . Some of ' em may look white , but " Some of them look like well bred European women . " " Illusion  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ women . Their caste laws and traditions are too strict . And besides  --  it is n't generally recognized outside India  --  but the Indians are extraordinarily decent about our women . Even in the Mutiny of ' 57 there was n't one instance of rape , although scores of102 BLACK LIGHTour women fell into their hands . Our troops , I am sorry to say , were gingered up with propaganda about rape and there was some dirty work done on the strength of it . But there was a rigid inquiry afterward and not one single instance , or even a suspicion of an instance of rape was discovered . Murder , yes , lots of it . Rape , no . There is n't another country in the world that you can say that for . " " How about the Rajah 's harems ? " " Oh , I 've heard that two or three of ' em have white wives , and they 're almost all polygamists , but that 's different . If a woman wants to sell herself in that way , Government ca @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ on the Rajah in all kinds of ways , but they ca n't legally prevent that kind of thing . It happens very seldom . " " How about the Christian missionaries ? Is there any check on them ? " " I think so  --  in fact , I 'm sure there is  --  mainly , of course , to prevent their falling foul of native prejudice . One fanatic might start a riot that 'd take an army corps to squelch . However , there 's nothing o ' that sort hereabouts . The local missionaries , so far as I know , have been more than usually tactful and the local Hindus seem to be a particularly broad-minded lot . We 've had no rioting or any rot like that . " " Lots of missionaries ? " " Lots of ' em . Presbyterians  --  Methodists  --  Baptists  --  Catholics  --  all sorts . " " They would be likely to know , I suppose , if there were a white girl living in an Indian temple . " " They certainly would . And they 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ know Miss Annie Weems ? " " I should say I do . We all do . She 's the only woman who was ever made an honorary member of our mess . There 's your information bureau  --  if you 're curious about girls in Indian temples or rajahs ' harems , askBLACK LIGHT 103Annie Weems . She actually rents her mission from the trustees , or whatever they call ' emselves , of the Hindu temple . She and the high priest are on such good terms that we joke her about it . There 's a story that she 's allowed inside the temple once a month , but that 's probablyuntrue and , anyhow , she denies it . " " What 's her mission for ? What does she do , I mean  --  proselytize ? " " No  --  does n't believe in it . Education , pure and simple . Runs a day-school for Indian children . I 've often ragged her about being more a Hindu than the Hindus are themselves , but of course that 's exaggeration . She 's a sane @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stop . Joe did not care to pursue that subject any further . It was clear enough that Annie Weems had somehow contrived to keep a secret , and it was certainly not Joe 's business to expose it  --  yet , at any rate . The mystery of Hawkes ' disappearance was easier solved ; a squadron farrier , who knew nothing about the breech-lock mechanism of a modern sporting rifle , explained that the Maharajah of Pooneh-Terai had asked for some one who was expert in such occultism and that Hawkes had volunteered to go and doctor the potentate 's expensive weapons . " That , " said Bruce , " is Hawkes all over . By the time he returns , he 'll not only have repaired a broken gun or two ; he 'll have learned nine-tenths of the Rajah 's business . However , he wo n't talk about it  --  until the time comes to let a eat peep from the bag in order to serve some other object he may have in view . If you do n't believe that , try to pump him @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Joe answered . " Yes , and saves his money . Greed is probably the secret of his genius for doing odd jobs . However , he does ' em , that 's the main thing . " Bruce , too , seemed to be a lonely sort of fellow , and there is just as much affinity in loneliness as in any104 BLACK LIGHTother state or condition . Hardly realizing that they liked each other they talked like a pair of old gossips as they rode the short tour of inspection , Bruce explainingthings that interested Joe for no other reason than that he liked the other 's confidences . By the tine they were ready for lunch Bruce had even offered the loan of a horse , and Joe had reciprocated by asking Bruce to take care of a magnificent sporting rifle " in case I should ever return to India and care to use it . " They were sowing seeds of friendship , hardly realizing it . There were very few officers there to lunch and most of those dropped in and bolted out again @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something or other mysterious in the background that was keeping every one on a strain that they tried to conceal ; Bruce made no reference to it , but while the others were there he seemed as conscious of it as they were . There was no indication of what its nature might be ; it was certainly not personal ill-feeling ; they appeared to be a hard-working outfit who got along well together . The only possible clue that occurred to Joe was the abruptnesswith which they changed the subject when he asked a casual question about the Maharajah of PoonchTerai ; however , he doubted that that was an accurate guess . Luncheon over , Bruce took him to his quarters and they lolled in long-armed chairs , Joe asking nothing better than escape from the hotel and from his mother 's neighborhood . True , she had probably gone to the caverns ten or fifteen miles away , but even that was too near , and she might return at any minute . When Bruce invited him to spend the night he leaped at the suggestion . " We @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to boast about , of course , but not bad . I thought of riding out there this evening and turning in early , so as to be ready for pig soon after daybreak . Did you ever stick pig 2 I can promise you something worth yourBLACK LIGHT 105trouble . Take your pick of my spears ; they 've all been sharpened . I 'll lend you a Kathiawari mare that stands right up to ' em  --  she 's savage  --  all you have to watch is that she does n't spin around and try to use her heels . You have to give her lots of spur ; she spun me off once  --  if she had n't stayed there savaging the boar I 'd have been a dead man . " Joe sent a note to the hotel informing his mother and warning her not to expect him until the following afternoon . The invitation made him thoroughly cheerful ; it enabled him to avoid her until after keeping his appointment at the mission , and gave him meanwhile something wholesomely barbarous to do and to think @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he was not even tempted to discuss his personal affairs - with Bruce , although Bruce became more and more intimate as they rode together toward the tent-club in the cool of the afternoon . Bruce even talked of his mother , but Joe was silent about his . Perhaps Joe in that mood was a companionable audience ; he was sympathetic , making no demands on the other 's patience , inviting confidence by simply not inviting it . At any rate , Bruce soon began to verge on telling secrets , and then finally to tell them  --  nothing serious , of course , but regimental intimacies normally not discussed with strangers , such as the Colonel 's wife 's flirtations and the sinful rate of interest charged by the local moneylender . Then , within sight of the tents , peeped forth the fundamental worry that had made the mess a sort of morgue at lunch-time . Joe 's shrewd guess had been right after all . " India would be all right if it were n't for rajahsThankGod , we 've got this tent-club to ourselves  --  Poonch-Terai @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ " What 's the matter with him ? " " He 's a cad , for one thing . Sends out shikaris to hamstring the best boars , so that he can ride ' em down easier . Can you beat that 9 " 106 BLACK LIGHT " Ca n't you interfere 7 " " We did . But we 're supposed to keep on decent terms with him . He 's the principal landlord hereabouts and he has extraordinary influence . He even has some kind of subtle authority over the temple . He 's said to have the right , among other things to choose a concubine a year from among the nautch-girls . It 's a right , like the European droit du seigneur , that has lapsed from disuse , but they say he 's trying to revive it , having set his cap at some young woman . The trouble is , that some of our troopers and non-coms got wind of it and took steps to protect the girl  --  no one knows why  --  they wo n't talk , except to one another and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ called down for snubbing Poonch-Terai not long ago ; they sent an officer from H. Q. to give us hell about it  --  something about his influence in the House of Princes that th Government happens to need at the moment . So we 're forced to be civil , and PoonchTeraitakes full advantage of it  --  riding for a fall , of course , but meanwhile we 're in difficulties . " " The military usually are , " said Joe , " when they run into politics . " " And religion . Do n't forget religion . Some one  --  and we 're pretty sure it 's Poonch-Terai  --  has got at a lot of our troopers set them by the ears against the others . Some of our men are Hindus , some Mohammedans ; they 're snarling , and the Colonel has the wind up , which makes it ghastly for the rest of us . We ca n't put the temple entirely out of bounds because of the religious edge to things . We ca n't picket the temple for protectionunless the priests request that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they ask , and they wo n't ask . If they did ask , they jolly well know that Poonch-Terai would put the screws on  --  politics and one thing and another ; I 've been told he could cut off more than half their revenues at one stroke of a pen . I wish they 'd let him have the girl ; she 'd probably prefer even that to a life of bellyshakingin the moonlight . " " What sort of girl is she 7 " Joe asked , wondering whyBLACK LIGHT 107the goose-flesh rose all over him . He told himself there was absolutely no reason why he should be disturbed on Amrita 's account , even supposing he knew for certain that Amrita was the girl in question . And , wondering what the color of her eyes was , he felt more disturbed than ever . He could imagine his mother as a fat spider ; never having seen the Maharajah of Pooneh-Terai it was easy to imagine him as something much worse  --  a sort of combination hornet-scorpion , with whiskers like the mogul on a ketchup bottle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ look alike to me , " Bruce answered . " I 've been told that they 're beastly immoral and inhumanly mischievous . Let 's hope we have better than goat for supper . I told the cook I 'd kill him if he serves me goat again . The fat rogue knows I wo n't , he 's too important . Time before last he tried to fool me by calling it Viceroy Stew . " However , it was " curried venison " this time , and though the goat was more than usually tough it was so embalmed in curry powder that the benefit of reasonabledoubt was on the cook 's side , so his life was saved , but not Joe 's digestion ; when they turned in , early , he wooed sleep in vain ; and when at last he did sleep he had nightmare . A monster came out of a temple pursuingAmrita ; and another monster came out of a cavern pursuing himself . Ile struggled to overtake Amrita . But Hawkes , who seemed in no hurry at all , kept demanding @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ see the color of her eyes , and what about it ? " Every now and then Hawkes changed into the Yogi with a pipe in his mouth , but even so he said the same thing . One of the monsters , when he dared to look at it , had bristling black whiskers and was male ; but the other was female . Both of them looked like spiders , and that futile ass Cummings wanted him to catch flies for them . At last one monster pounced on him and he began to fight desperately ; but it turned out to be Captain Bruce waking him for the tea and toast that are the bread and wine of Englishmen 's religion . CHAPTER ELEVEN " Are you drunk , Joe ? " Joe 's horsemanship was good enough but nothing wonderful . The Kathiawari mare lived up to the reputationBruce had given her ; she had to be blindfolded before Joe could mount her , and when the blindfold was removed she wished with all her savage heart to kill the unoffending sais , who ran for cover @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ fight ; it brought his dogged patience uppermost , and the mare learned presently that she had some one on her back who owned a stronger will than hers . However , she tried all ways of testing him and she was going backward toward the rising sun , and Joe was consequently facing Bruce when he heard Bruce swear and saw his face set like flint before it thawed again into the deliberate smile that the English imagine makes them pleasant to approach . Joe did not understand what was happening until he veered the mare around . Then he knew without Bruce telling . Gone was the glory of Indian morning . None save Joshua has ever made the sun stand still , but there are men whose uninvited presence can rob sunlight of its charm ; and of such men Poonch-Terai was chief , at any rate that morning . He exuded a dry diabolism ; each of his handsome features seemed an accent of the underlying guile ; his suavity was insolence , his seat on horseback arrogant , and the horse had cost him fifteen thousand @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ rode forward showing his white teeth in a smile that set every fiber of Joe 's being tingling with resentment . It was a case of instant hatred as unreasoned and sudden as the war between fire and water . Even Bruce detected it , and Bruce had malice of his own to keep him busy. 108BLACK LIGHT 109The Maharajah drew rein fifteen paces from them , spinning his spear before he let it lie across his saddlebow . He was a sartorial dream ; from crimson turban to the spurs on his beautiful boots he was the last exquisiteword of elegance . His black mustache was waxed , his black beard oiled and curled , his dark eyes underlinedwith pigment like a woman 's . His lithe body , only a little coarsened by debauch , sat like a centaur 's . He was a challenge ; Joe itched to couch a spear at him and actually eyed the point between his ribs where he would drive the blade home , smiling at his own absurdity  --  a smile that Poonch-Terai interpreted as a salute to his rank . Bruce @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ in another radiant smile , his dark-ivory skin so slightly changing color that Bruce did not notice it , but Joe did . " I have heard of you , " said Poonch-Terai . " Are you not the man from Jupiter ? " That brought the Yogi to Joe 's mind , and the temple  --  the iiautch-girls  --  the man whose jaw IIawkes punched so unexpectedly  --  the story that the Maharajah sought new fuel for his harem fires . Was this the man who desired Amrita ? Joe had never felt so venomously jealous in his life ; it almost frightened him ; from force of habit he tried to smother the emotion and answer civilly . " Why do you ask that ? " " I was told you were named that by a man who makes very few mistakes . ' . ' " You mean the Yogi at the temple ? I think he had probably heard the name of a business corporation in which I have some interest . " It was an unfortunate answer ; it opened the way for a sneer of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ not to suffer gladly . " Wise old Yogi . But I wonder , do n't you , how he realized that an American and his business ca n't be separated , even on a temple threshold ? " 110 BLACK LIGHT " IIe 's the sole one of your countrymen I 've met who was n't hungrier for dollars than for decency , " Joe answered . Poonch-Terai subsided for the moment , halfpretendingnot to have caught the meaning of that counterthrust , but he threw Joe one glance sideways that meant war as surely as the shot at Sarajevo did . He began to talk to Bruce about the wild boars . He had spoiled all Bruce 's quietly made arrangements . " I 'm camped five miles away . My men reported your men beating in this direction , so I ordered mine to join yours . We 'll get pig , do n't doubt it . Can your friend ride ? " " We only want one apiece , " Bruce answered . " Have to be back at mess in time for tiffin . " " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ boars worth killing . " " Any of ' em lame ? " Bruce asked him , but PoonchTeraiaffected not to hear that ; he stood up in the stirrups , shielding his eyes with his hand . " That 's my head man signaling . They 've a sounder of pig in the scrub beyond that clump of trees . Shall we ride on ? " He began to canter , Bruce and Joe following three horses ' lengths behind him , Bruce trying to signal to Joe his disappointment and apologies for the unwelcome intrusion ; his lips moved , but he said no word aloud because Poonch-Terai 's perfectly modeled ears with the little gold earrings in their lobes were notoriously keen . They took cover beside the clump of trees and PoonchTeraigave orders to his head man. , who directed scores of almost naked beaters . Armed with tin cans , tomtomsand dissonant trumpets , they had surrounded a sounder of pig in a maze of waist-high undergrowth some acres in extent . It was a perfect place for pig  --  impossible for horses and by no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Maharajah the head manBLACK LIGHT 111maneuvered the beaters all to one side of the copse , and then the tin can chorus started as the scythe-shaped mob of beaters invaded the cover to drive the pig into the open . It occurred then to Poonch-Terai that he was possibly usurping precedence . He turned to Bruce : " You 'd better give the word . " Bruce nodded , his quiet eyes watching the billowing undergrowth , his rein-hand restraining an excited horse . There was more than one sounder within that small area ; the Maharajah 's men had swept down in a huge semicircle like a drag-net ; there were pigs of all ages in there milling , grunting , squealing and the surface of the undergrowth suggested a section of sea in which huge shoals of fish have been surrounded . There were collisions in there  --  fights  --  until suddenly one whole sounder more than a hundred strong turned and charged back through a gap in the line of beaters . Poonch-Terai swore excitedly : " That 's your men 's fault ! You ought to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ gap on purpose . He 'll try to blame it on my man " But there was no time for an argument . The other sounder , following a huge gray boar , broke cover in the opposite direction , the gray boar well in the lead of his tremendous family and turning between spurts for a glimpse of what the danger might be . " Ride ! " said Bruce . The target was that gray grandfather-boar . He saw them , and he knew it . Never a gray boar breathed that was not more than willing to take on fifty times his weight in any kind of enemy whatever . No need to explain the situation to him . He grunted and the obedient sounder turned back into cover , leaving him free of responsibility and unimpeded to choose his own battle-ground . First blood is the objective . Whoever can first show crimson on his spear-point is the winner of the race . The fight with the boar , as a rule does not begin untilI12 BLACK LIGHTthe race for his tushes is over . Poonch-Terai on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ length , Bruce following and Joe last . The boar took a straight line away from the sun , to put plenty of distance between himself and his family before giving battle . He went like the wind . NTith a judgment worthy of a fox he chose a line of country that would strain the horses to the utmost but without overtaxing his own strength . Boulders , sheet-rock , dry watercourses , scrambled undergrowth , he took them all ; and not until he judged the horses were well winded and the foam was frothing on his own jaws did he turn in a wide semicircle with his savage little red eye studying his purst.ters to discover which could be taken at worst advantage . That " jink , " as they call it , cost Poonch-Terai the lead . It left him far out on the left flank , fifty yards from Bruce , who lost sight of the boar for the moment and checked to save his horse unnecessary labor in a wrong direction . Joe was alone on the right , with the gray boar waiting for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the Kathiawari mare as eager as the boar to get to business . No spur needed . Joe couched his spear and charged . The Kathiawari slipped on a loose stone , stumbled and recovered , giving Poonch-Terai the fraction of a moment 's opportunity ; he came on , passing Bruce and spurring to overtake Joe , who saw him through the corner of an eye and accepted an unspoken challenge . It was all over in thirty seconds , and Joe the winner . But a man can be reborn in thirty seconds . His whole life 's history can review itself , with the essentials selected and the unimportant , so-called major crises faded into the background . All his acquired characteristics can slough off in less than that time and the underlying man , the unknown man who has been learning from experiencebehind the baffling mask , can break through never again entirely to return to hiding . Joe had never suspected himself of chivalry . As heBLACK LIGHT 113rode at that boar , with Poonch-Terai spurring to over- take him , he was conscious of another @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . The excitement , the reckless speed , the delirious sense of danger , were all relative to an idea , and the idea was within him . Poonch-Terai was the devil . Paradoxically , too , the boar was Poonch-Terai . A woman 's eyes , whose color he could not see , were watching him ; he was not fighting to protect her but for approval , on which he knew per- fectly well that his own opinion of himself must depend henceforward . Should he fail , she would suffer ; he knew that , but he knew , too , that she would ignore the suffering ; nothing at all could grieve her but a lack of grace within himself , and grace was wordless  --  some- thing to be lived , not argued . He would know within a brace of seconds whether or not he had it . He rode like a plumed adventurer , to find out . The boar turned tail suddenly , but that was a ruse to throw his adversary off guard and to get room to build impetus . He @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ concentrated ounce of speed and courage there was in him , timing his effort perfectly to meet his enemy on the narrow ground between two hil- locks , where only one at a time could meet him and there was no avoiding his froth-wet tushes or the shock of his furious onslaught . It was death for him or for his adversary , and long odds on the boar , but Joe 's spear took him straight and strong between the shoulder- blades as he rose to slash at the mare with his murderous little ivory daggers . Speed , weight , strength of horse and boar and man combined to skewer him dead to the earth as the spear-haft snapped in Joe 's hand . He was Joe 's boar  --  first and last blood . It was neither the boar nor the Kathiawari mare 's attempt to turn and use her heels on a fallen foe that sent Joe sprawling on the hard earth . Poonch-Terai came crashing into him , whirling his spear , indignant to have missed by half a dozen strides and hurling into the114 BLACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thoroughbred 's shoulder caught the mare in flank , as she turned with one hoof on the ground , and sent her rolling . Luckily she threw Joe three times his length as she fell , and though he skinned his face and forearms on the rock-hard earth and he was rather badly bruised , he was not stunned and no bones were broken . He was rather less badly hurt than Poonch-Terai . The thoroughbred tripped on the Kathiawari 's scramblinglegs and fell in a heap a yard or two beyond her , spraining both the Maharajah 's wrists as he extended his hands to protect his head . It was Joe who raised the Maharajah to his feet ; Bruce drew rein beside them and , seeing there was no great harm done , began edging his horse toward the other two in order to catch them before they could bolt home . " Good spear ! " he said laughing , but Joe and the Maharajah hardly heard him . They were face to face , toe to toe , glaring , Joe 's nose dripping blood on @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ past his eyes ; but even the blood did not make him uglier than Poonch-Terai , whose glowering eyes and outthrust underliptold of more than pain in his sprained wrists . There was hatred there  --  racial , temperamental and intuitive , increased , set flaring , but not caused by rivalry . Beneathit there was the deadlier enmity of one ideal for another . " Damn you , what do you think this game is  --  polo t " Joe demanded . Poonch-Terai backed away from him , nursing his wrists , glancing over his shoulder to make sure Bruce was out of earshot . " Your pig , " he said . " But go back to America and stick them in the slaughter-yards . That 's something that you understand . " " When your wrists are in shape to protect yourself I will thrash you for that , " Joe answered . Poonch-Terai grinned savagely . " You ? You willBLACK LIGHT 11.5thrash me ? Go back to America before you learn what I can do to you ! And meanwhile , stay away from temples ! @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Poonch-Terai into the saddle , interrupting that lowvoicedconversation , which had left Joe strangely cool but with a queer sensation up his spine . They rode slowly campward until they met the Maharajah 's men , who fussed over his wrists and swarmed around him to escort him to his own camp . Bruce waited until some of his own shikaris came , and when he had sent them to cut out the dead boar 's tushes he and Joe cantered toward the club tents for a bath , rough bandages and breakfast . " I can get the dirt out for you . It may hurt a bit , but I 'm a dabster at getting a cut clean . However , do n't forget to let Hawkes go over you afterward . The man 's a wizard . If you asked me , I 'd say it 's magic that he learned from some Yogi or other . I was telling him only the other day , he 's a fool not to buy his discharge and go home and open up a beauty parlor  --  make his fortune @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ nor were Bruce 's bandages artistic ; an hour 's work made Joe fairly comfortable , but he was still bleeding a little and it was fortunate for more than his vanity that he did not catch sight of his face in a mirror ; had he known how unpresentable lie looked he might have postponed calling on Annie Weems . However , Bruce encouraged him to call on her : " It may be she who taught Hawkes how to tittivate a cut skin . Let her look at it ; she 'll be no worse than , a military saw-bones , and she 's sure to improve on what I 've done to you . And by the way , thank you for keepingyour hands off Poonch-Terai . You had a perfect right to kick him . But if you had  --  I do n't know what might happen . " Joe had read the murder in the Maharajah 's eyes . He116 BLACK LIGHTknew that the brief exchange of insults only hinted at such hatred as could never have been caused by roughstuffin the hunting field . There @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ with only once , the color of whose eyes he did not know . She was at the bottom of it . IIe knew that , though he could not understand it . Not for a moment did he think of himself as in love with her , since that would be ridiculous . Iie could not be . Beyond the fact that she was possibly the daughter of his mother 's bridesmaid , she meant nothing whatever to him . With his grained , deliberate mind he knew he was the last man likely to fall in love with a young girl met by moonlight near a prison wall . She had preached to him . She had mocked him . She had made him feel like ten cents . She was in some mysterious way involved in a religious cult with which he had no sympathy . IIe would be likelier to fall in love with a Salvation Army lassie in Union Square , New York , tambourine and all . If he did , it would startle his friends less , though it might offend his mother more @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ lies , perhaps , about an Indian princess and get them printed in the papers and in Who 's Who . He could hardly talk to Bruce , for thinking of Amrita . Strange name , it stuck in his memory ; he could not normally recall a girl 's name fifteen minutes after he had met her . Meeting girls never excited him  --  never had . But he " , as excited about meeting this one again . He put part of that down to the shock of being thrown from a horse . But he knew there was more than that to it . He wished he could remember what color her eyes were  --  ass 1But he told himself he had a right to be curious . Curiosity amused him ; that was it , he was amused . In Joe 's life there had been precious little genuine amusement . Always his mother there to embitter the juice of things . He had a right to taste amusement while he could . And lie would take care this time that hisBLACK LIGHT 117mother should have no @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ it . It even occurred to him to take Amrita for his mistress for a while , but the thought was colorlessand insincere . He could say that to himself ; the words came easily enough ; but he could not quite imagine it ; it gave him no thrill . " Well , why should it ? If I were in love with her it might be different . I wonder how it feels to be in love . I 'd like to try it . But I suppose I 'd play the damned ass , just like all the others . " In a sort of day-dream he dismounted at the front door of the mess and waited inside for the dog-cart that Bruce offered to lend him . Bruce ascribed his silence to shock from the accident and made no attempt to force conversation . " You 'll be all right in a day or two . Keep quiet and stay off liquor . Show your cuts to Annie Weems , and let Hawkes see them , but avoid the doctor like the devil unless something serious sets @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Here 's the dog-cart . So long . Enjoyed your company no end . I 'll send those tushes to you . When you 're through with the dog-cart tell the sais to come straight home . Come and see me again when you 're well enough  --  or if you 're not , send for me and I 'll come and see you . So long . " Joe liked him . But he was glad to leave him . He let the sais drive . It suited him to sit still and imagine what the next hour might bring forth , and to think of steps he might take to prevent that blackguard Poonch-Terai from having his will of Amrita , as he had no doubt whatever now was his intention . He always did despise a man who employed agents to bag women for him . Also lie despised women who fell for that kind of negotiation  --  not that it made them worse than other women  --  they were merely lacking in dignity . The whole world was a whoresome mess of guile and blackmail . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @  --  it can be done  --  costs nothing  --  pays not bad118 BLACK LIGHTdividends , in self-esteem , which may be silly but feels good . He grew more and more excited as he neared the mission  --  more and more pleased with the thought that he was stealing a march on his mother  --  more and more confident that he would manage the whole business of Amrita and her future without even consulting his mother . He would tell the old termagant what he had done . She could like it or lump it . All one to himself . The day had dawned at last when her authority was broken . He would not stand by and see his mother bind this young girl captive to her chariot as she had bound so many other men and women . But it would be easier to manage if he kept his discovery secret from her for a while . As they entered the quiet square and the horse 's hoofs rang on ancient pavement he heard Annie Weems ' piano going  --  strangely brilliant sound amid that quiet setting . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ but the words were unintelligible , in a language he did not know . He climbed down and stood by the mission door listening ; the upper half was ajar on a long brass hook . The song ceased . He heard a girl 's laughter and then voices in conversation , but there was a curtain in the passage and the only voice he could recognize was Amrita 's  --  as clear as a bell , yet not unpleasantlyassertive . " Why , yes . I have written all my songs in English . Annie insists on it . Would you like to hear this one ? " She began to sing in English something about stars that wonder at men 's inconsistency . As she sang the curtain parted and Hawkes strode through into the outer room . He saw Joe  --  beckoned to him  --  tiptoed to the door and led the way in . In the passage he turned to speak behind his hand : " I took you at your word , sir " But Joe was listening to the song . Hawkes led the way @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the piano , BLACK LIGHT 119sat Amrita , singing , with the soft light through slatted shutters making an aureole around her . Annie Weems sat in an armchair wearing spectacles , seeming to be studying sonic one else who sat in a corner near the door . That some one was invisible to Joe until he strode into the room . " You said for me to " Joe strode in , aware of something damnable and resolute to meet it , but not yet guessing what it might be . Amrita stopped singing and stared at the blood on Joe 's bandages . Annie Weems sprang to her feet . Joe turned toward the corner near the door  --  and faced his mother . " You ? Oh , hello . " " You said for me to see your mother , sir , about that thousand pounds , and " " And I have told him it 's too much . I wo n't pay it , " said Mrs. Beddington . " If you make promises like that , Joe , you may keep them yourself . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ you keep this secret from me ? " Joe kept silence . " Have you been brawling ? What have you done to your face ? " Joe stared at her . " Are you drunk , Joe ? " " Stone-cold sober  --  for the first time in my life , I dare say . Ilow do , Miss Weems . How do , Amrita . " He was glad he had no pistol in his hand . He knew , for just one fraction of a second , something that no jury ever understood -- exactly how some sorts of seemingly motiveless murder happen . CHAPTER TWELVE " Taters a la Kaiser Bill . " Miss WEEMS , can you get a doctor for him ? Joe is my only son . If anything should happen " I 'm all right , Mother  --  scratched , that 's all . " However , he sat down , glad to do it . Annie Weems came over to him and undid the bandages . Swift , silent , sure of herself , she only glanced  --  then led Joe to a bathroom @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Amrita produced medicated cotton and a basin , pushing Hawkes out of the way . Joe let go  --  leaned back  --  hardly knew that his head was resting on Amrita ' s bosom ; but he felt a relief that was almost like sleep as her fingers touched his temples and passed through his hair . His mother ceased to have any importance in the scheme of things . Amrita was essential . And the strangest part was , that he seemed always to have known Amrita  --  always to have trusted Annie Weems  --  always to have liked Hawkes . He neither belonged to his mother , nor she to him . He heard IIawkes whistle in the way a man does who is estimating damage . The next thing he really knew , he was lying on a couch not far from the piano and Amrita was singing softly to a tune that Hawkes was strumming , while Annie Weems talked to his mother . At last Amrita stopped , and then he knew the song was nonsense because she said so : " Ilawkesey , wo n't @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ is n't worth singing ? " " There 's ugly things worth mention , " he objected . " True , but it 's the contrast between ugliness andbeauty that is interesting . This is n't a comic song . " " It is , " said Hawkes . " I laughed while I was writingit. " 120BLACK LIGHT 121 " You laughed at you . " " Am I beautiful ? " " You 're comic . There is beauty in your effort to do what I said you could if you would only try . But you must try harder . " " I sang it to some of the men and they laughed like anything . " " At you . They would laugh at the song if you put some humor in it . I 've seen corpses that were funny , but the corpses in your song are only nasty . They 're dead , whereas they ought to be masks and garments that the actors left behind them . You ca n't make death funny if you do n't remember there is no such thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ when they see a man slain on the stage ? It is because they know intuitively , without knowing that they.know , that actual death is just like that ; they know the actor only takes his costume off and goes home . You go home and write that song again . " " Teaching 's a trade , " said Hawkes . " It 's like drilling rookies . You have to praise a fellow now and then . " " Do n't I take pains with you ? " " Yes , but " Is n't that the kindest sort of praise ? " " Maybe , but " Bring me something good . I 'll praise it , Hawkesey . " Joe stirred . His mother crossed the room , resentmentbristling through her well spread smile . " Are you feeling better , Joe ? " He knew he was hardly well enough to fight her just yet . He tried to postpone the issue . " Feel rotten . " " Never mind , I 'll take you to the hotel and get you a doctor . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ answered . " Hawkes , would you be kind enough to see my mother back to the hotel ? " He caught Miss Weems ' eye , " May I stay a while ? " 122 BLACK LIGHTHawkes offered himself . Mrs. Beddington was no terror to him ; he had acted orderly to a general with dyspepsia ; he had been drilled by a sergeant-major who desired to keep him from promotion ; there was nothing Hawkes did not know about enduring insult without letting it sink under his skin . She ignored him , but he did not mind that either . " It is n't polite , Joe , to inflict yourself on Miss Weems . " " I came to talk to her , " said Joe . But he glanced at Amrita. iHis mother , too , glanced at Amrita . " Joe , I wish you to come home and talk to me first " " What about ? " he demanded . She compressed her lips into a thin line with a trained smile at either corner , meant to seem inscrutable . Iler @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " she answered . " See you later , Mother . I 'll be back in time for dinner . " War  --  war  --  war at last ; he had declared it and she understood him . Joe felt all the hot exhilaration that accompanies a challenge , but he masked it , not wishing to seem ridiculous , since none but he , he supposed , knew what ferocity and resources he would have to combat . He was not given to mock heroics . He invited no one 's sympathy . IIe meant to fight this to a finish with his own resources , yet not more than guessing what those might be . He was not fooled by his mother 's instant change of tactics . " May he stay with you a little while longer , Miss Weems ? He seems to be worse shaken than he realizes . " Annie Weems ' smile masked nothing . " Ile may stay here as long as he pleases , " she answered , plainly intimatinghe should stay until Annie Weems saw fit to let him go @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ : " I will send the doctor to him here . " BLACK LIGHT 123 " Dr. Karter Singh would very likely come if you should ask him . " " A native ? " " A Sikh . " " Great heavens , is there no white doctor ? " " There 's an army doctor , who is usually busy , and a civilian who is nearly always drunk . " " For God 's sake send the drunkard , " Joe interrupted . " Tank him up before you send him . I can manage drunkards . " " Joe ! " " See you later , Mother . " Mrs. Beddington fussed her way out of the place , ignoring Hawkes deliberately and apparently forgetting to notice Amrita . She kept Annie Weems standing at the front door for several minutes , asking her barbed questions about the mission-school but saying nothing that could be interpreted as actual insolence . Amrita , straight faced , strummed at the piano . " Do n't you love to know the worst ? " she wondered . " Man from @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? " " And my thousand pounds , " Hawkes added . " And why are you pretending to be worse hurt than you are ? " " Ca n't you see for yourself ? " Joe asked her . " See , yes . I can read your aura . Smoky crimson . Where was Mars in your horoscope ? Are you afraid of her ? " " Too many questions . " " Answer one then . " " No , I 'm no longer afraid . " " You will be soon  --  unless I 'm seeing you and her all crooked . Ca n't you read auras ? No ? You 're psychic , you could learn . Hers is dingy indigo and sulphur , with lurid smoky-green tonguelets like the petals of a sunflower . When you see it that color , you perhaps do n't know you see it , but it scares you all the same . It would scare me , if she were my mother. 124 BLACK LIGHTDo you hate her ? You should n't . When you hate her , you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a spider gets a fly . If you were sentimental about her , she could get you that way too . She is dreadfully strong . I 'd hate her if I dared . " Her fingers strummed on the piano keys a sort of obbligato to her conversation  --  strange experiments with chords that seemed to illustrate the color of her thought . It was perhaps not music but it was humorous , like a Greek chorus mocking the speaker . Joe felt intimate , as if she and he had known each other all their lives . " Why did you keep me secret ? " she repeated suddenly . " You have a way of doing that . You boil and sulk inside yourself . It poisons you . That is n't like a man from Jupiter . Your forte is direct action . It would be good for you to dance and sing  --  screamyell  --  swear  --  doanything to boil off . " Joe grinned . He had a sudden mental picture of himselfcavorting like a temperamental Frenchman . " Laugh ! " she urged . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Do you know what solemnity is ? It 's the gloom with which asses disguise their ignorance . Why imitate them ? " " It was quite unconscious , " Joe answered humbly . " That does n't make it harmless . If your head did n't ache I would make you dance with me . Hawkesey used to go everywhere looking like a sermon on the predamnationof unbaptized infants . But I made him dance every time he saw me . When I had corrupted him enough , so that he even began to like himself a little , I made him promise to dance whenever he thought of me . Now see him . Hawkesey is almost human . " " Cost me money . I wore out a pair of boots , " said Hawkes . " It nearly got me out of the army . I was sat on by a medical committee  --  two fat doctors and a thin one  --  claimed I was crazy . I did n't deny it . I told ' em I danced to try and feel as happy as a @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and I went to BLACK LIGHT 125Mount Abu , where a heathen taught me how to dance like Krishna with a flute . " " IIe means , " explained Amrita , " that a venerable Yogi taught him . " " He was n't pious , " Hawkes objected . " Venerable people never are , " she answered , fingeringthe keys . She struck chords like Stravinsky'sseveralin quick succession to a startling tempo . " Venerablepeople laugh with God instead of making faces at Him . That Yogi who taught you , Hawkesey " " Swag-bellied old corner-man , as full of repartee as a big drum 's full o ' thunder . " "  --  is an ex-subadar-major of Bengal cavalry . They say he can talk with tigers and that wild birds come when he calls them . " " Do you believe that ? " Joe asked . " Why not ? It is n't difficult . But it 's bad for the birds and tigers . They learn to trust people . Do you trust people ? " Annie Weems returned into the room , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " Amrita suggested . But she suddenly left the piano and sat on the arm of Annie Weerns ' chair . " Was she as cruel as all that ? " " She accused me of raising you for blackmail pur-poses . " Joe flushed with shame . " Did she use those words ? " he asked . " No . She merely said that she is blackmail-proof but that if I care to talk with her attorneys she will give me their address . " Joe swore under his breath . " Explode ! " Amrita urged . " You man from Jupiter , one of these days you will kill some one , or else some one will kill you . You vibrate like hell with the lid shut , as Hawkesey would say . " " Hell ? " said Hawkes . " My dreams of affluence  --  ten centuries  --  a thousand quid " 126 BLACK LIGHTHe eyed Joe sideways . Joe observed him without comment . Amrita observed both of them . " Are you a mean man ? " she asked suddenly . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at her . " Damned if I know , " he answered . He continued to stare . She returned it . He perfectly understood that she was in some way reading his character . He did not mind . IIe felt no impulse to deceive her as a man normally does when a woman tries to understand him . IIe could see the color of her eyes at last  --  deep blue with a hint of violet . He wondered whether she was really beautiful or whether he was prejudiced and perhaps not seeing accurately . " I would like to paint your portrait , " he said abruptly . " Why ? If you are really skilful you can only paint your own opinion of me . " " Are you afraid of my opinion ? " " I 'm afraid you might produce a lie and hate that . Next , you 'd hate me . Painters become enamored of their models , but they end by kicking them out-of-doors . " " Are you afraid of my falling in love with you ? " " One can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ One might as well talk of falling on to horse-back or falling up a mountain . Love ? Climb and find it ! Wings  --  you need wings and speed and courage to come within a million miles of love . That 's closer than most folk come . Most of them catch their mates with traps or quicklime and then cage them and say Sing ! Those fall hard , and it hurts them . Did n't you fall hard enough this morning ? " " Who taught you to be cynical ? " She laughed . Hawkes almost jeered . Annie Weems glanced at the clock and excused herself , saying she had a new cook who needed attention . She paused in the door of the passage that led to the kitchen : " Rita cynical ? " BLACK LIGHT 127 " Cynical ? " IIawkes echoed . " Shall I show the cook potatoes a la Kaiser Bill ? " He followed Annie Weems into the kitchen . " So it offends them to hear you called cynical ? " " They think it 's funny . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ she was genuinely beautiful . She reminded him of some one  --  some actress  --  he could n't remember who . " Are you a fatalist ? " he asked her suddenly . " That is like asking me , am I a fool . Destiny is  --  whether or not we believe it . Fate is what overtakes fatheads . " Joe winced . He did not like her to use Hawkes ' phrases . Was he jealous of Hawkes ? He wondered . It might not be a bad idea to pay Hawkes that thousand pounds he might quit the army  --  leave India . But " Do you know Maharajah Poonch-Terai ? " he asked . " Indeed I do . Fate . " " Your fate ? " " Trying to masquerade as destiny . " " I ca n't see any difference . " " There is n't much . It 's like the difference between day and night , that 's all . Opposite sides of one idea . " " We are slaves of destiny ? " She laughed . " We are slaves @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . I 'm a rebel . Are n't you ? " Joe did not wish to think about his mother just then . " Was I destined to fall from a horse this morning ? " " Fated . Destiny is our servant . We create destiny . Fate is created for us by the things we do or do n't do . " " I do n't get you . " " Fate did ! And destiny saved you . Something you did to some one else , in this life or another one , produced its exactly measured consequences and " It was Poonch-Terai who bunted into me  --  on pur-pose. " 128 BLACK LIGHT " That makes no difference , except to him . He set new consequences cycling on their course ; he will have to meet them whenever the clock strikes , and it is sure to strike at an inconvenient moment . Possibly you injuredhim some time . " " I never met the man before . " " How do you know ? Can you prove you did n't ? What were you , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ say , thirty years ago ? However , possibly you did n't injure him . You did wrong to some one , or you . would n't have had wrong done to you this morning . On the other hand , you had built up destiny . Fine things  --  splendid , noble , magnanimous things you did in former lives , or possibly in this one , built up forces that saved you . Probably you call it accident , but it makes no difference what you call it . Names do n't alter cases . What sloes make a difference , is , how you behaved when it happened . If you had turned on Poonch-Terai and beaten him , you would have set new consequences cyclingfor yourself . That is what was meant by turn the other cheek ' ; you not only learn self-control and build up character but you also pay forgotten debts and create new destiny with which to meet fate when it happens . It 's like the difference between having money in the bank , at compound interest , and incurring debts at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a friend , and the quicker you pay the less it costs you . " Joe smiled . " Mather a complicated scheme of things . " " So is astronomy , complicated . So are biologychemistry  --  law . And yet it 's all divinely simple . Rereadhistory and see whether it does n't fit what you call the complicated scheme of things . Try to make it not fit ; you ca n't without distorting all the facts . " " Do you mean , for instance , that I 've met you in a former life ? " " Of course you have . Lots of times , in lots of former lives . " " And my mother ? " BUCK LIGHT 129 " Certainly . You ca n't create an intimate relation such as that by accident . It must have taken millions of incidents to bring you two to a point where you could help each other best in just that way . " " Help each other ? Lord God ! Wait until you know her ! " " Let me think of an @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ to be bullied by the Tudors and the Stuarts ? Did n't it make them wake up ? What but pressure made the colonies win their independence ? Do you know what pressure does to certain sorts of seed ! You were born your mother 's child because you were ready to stand just that test . There is no injustice  --  nowhere in all the universe  --  not for a moment . " Joe laughed outright . " If you 'd ever run a bank , or a business , or fought a law-suit ; or if you 'd ever seen my mother sack a raft of her employees ; or if you know how laws are forced through legislatures " " Justice  --  every atom of it including all the injustice ! No one escapes his exact deserts or lacks his opportunity to learn .

" " But what 's the purpose of it ? " " Character . We seem unable to learn except by experience . " " And the end of it all ? " " Nobody knows . But even the materialists , who are blinded by matter  --  probably to make them hopeless , so that they will be forced in the end to wake up and to130 BLACK LIGHTtear away the bandage from their own eyes  --  even they assure us that nothing in all nature is wasted . It is iogical to deduce that we ourselves are not wasted . " " Nothing is finally wasted , " Joe agreed . " I know that . When we 're dead we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . Law itself must have a cause . I can grasp that much . Most of us call the cause God . A happens I believe in God ; the arguments against the omnipresence of a First Cause seem to me ridiculous . Finite calculations ca n't measure infinity and we can prove , for instance , that infinity squared is equal to the square root of infinity plus or minus anything you please  --  which knocks the props from under logic , with which , nevertheless , we prove the existence of a calculus that transcends logic . So I 'm wide open to believe anything  --  except that some super-intelligence does n't direct the Universe . All the same , if what you say is true , or even half true  --  and I admit it sounds plausible  --  there ought to be something that at least looks like proof of it . Ilow can you prove , or pretend to prove , that you , for instance , have lived more than one life in this world ? " " I can prove it as easily as you @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the sun shines , " she answered . " I 'd be interested . " " Possibly your time has come to wake up . If it has , there is n't a force in all the universe that can prevent you . If it has n't , I could pile proof on proof and you could no more understand it than Pilate could understandJesus . Did you ever try to teach a blind man about color ? Or a tone-deaf person about music ? Or a dog about poetry ? It 's sometimes easiest to teach the dog .  --  Or did you ever try to teach a criminal the principles of ethics ? It ca n't be done , until experience ripens us . Then we ca n't help learning , because that kind of intelligence evolves within us . " " Lunch , " said Annie Weems , appearing in the door . " We do n't call it tiffin . It 's plain New England lunch . " BLACK LIGHT 131 " And taters a la Kaiser Bill . " Hawkes peered over her shoulder . " You @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , then chill ' em . Subsequent you treat ' em handsomeon a hot grid . Then add applesauce and condimentsto suit , with Dutch cheese  --  grated . Yum-yum ! " CHAPTER THIRTEEN " I am not in the world to learn cowardice , but courage . " LUNCH was astonishing . It felt like the first real family meal in which Joe had ever taken part . Ilawkes , at the end of the table , making jokes about the food and telling anecdotes from far-off barracks about brass hats ' lapses from dignity , seemed part of it . It was impossible to realize that Rita , in a Sears-Roebuck summer frock and with her hair looking as if Pan had run his fingers through it , was the same girl who had sung to prisoners by moonlight . The light was different in the dining-room ; it made her eyes look mischievous and her lips luscious . Joe wondered why Hawkes had not tried to seduce her . Perhaps Hawkes had . Perhaps he had succeeded . He felt a sudden pang of jealousy . Then something that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ how so beautiful a girl could possibly have been raised in an Indian temple and remain a virgin . IIe pondered that a long time , taking privilege of silence on account of his headache . He studied Annie Weems . It seemed to him she was a woman who knew secrets  --  and could keep them . He hoped Amrita was a virgin , but supposed it did n't matter ; nobody nowadays troubled about that trifle . Nevertheless , he already felt so much like one of the family that he almost had a right to know . He wondered whether she would tell the truth if he should ask her . IIe smiled at himself .. Being human , he would believe a confession of guilt ; a claim to virginity would leave him incredulous . Better not ask . Might embarrassher . All the same , he would give a lot to know what went on in an Indian temple . The hell of it was that his mother would make insinuationsdifficult to disprove . She would pound away132BLACK LIGHT 133at it , perpetually harping on the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ been first to find the girl , it might be different ; she would almost certainly have tried , in that case , to subdue and enslave her , tempting her first with a glimpse of what money can do , then gradually imposing insolence on insolence until the victim surrendered  --  he had seen her kill a girl in that way ; the doctors had called it anemia , which it probably was , but Joe knew what had caused it . She would kill this girl too , if she as much as suspectedhe thought well of her . And , what was more , she already did suspect . She would stop at nothing  --  at nothing  --  no limit . How could he take the girl 's part without first arriving at an understanding with her ? Should he quit before the fight began and let his mother wreak her savagery unimpeded ? He smiled at the thought of it  --  smiled with his eves too , as he recognizedsuddenly how swift and absolute his own revolt against his mother had been , and how determined he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her ? He wondered . " What amuses you ? " asked Annie Weems . " Something I want to ask you afterward . " That was the right idea . He had not meant to say it ; it had slipped out ; but he was glad he had said it . Annie Weems was the kind of woman you could talk to intimately without risk of betrayal . She might not say much , but she would listen ; and what she did say would be something a man might bet on . Damn that fellow Hawkes ; he could make his wise-cracks , could n't he , without leaning so close to Amrita 's chair ? To offset Hawkes ' impertinence Joe started telling stories of his own , and he could do that admirably when he made the effort . His stories were a mite too heavy on their feet , he knew that , but they were interesting ; he had worked hard at the accomplishment , to help overcome the prejudice against himself as his mother 's son . He could talk Hawkes out of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the dining-table Annie Weems , lowvoiced , invited him to join her in the schoolroom . However , he had to postpone that tote-a-tete . The doctor came  --  Tobias Fetherstonehaugh Muldoon M.D.  --  a trifle husky from his morning quart of Scotch , but steady on his feet and primed with virtue . Annie Weems was civil but he snubbed her . " I will see the patient alone , " he said abruptly . Annie Weems opened the door of a small room furnished with a couch and two chairs . Joe walked in . Muldoon closed the door behind him  --  paused  --  opened it again suddenly  --  then slammed it . " Never know who 's listening in a place like this . " Joe made no comment . He studied the man 's dishonestnose . " Your mother was so insistent that I put off another patient . May I see your tongue a moment ? Pulse , please . Temperature  --  under the tongue and keep the lips shut . " Silence , during which antagonism grew . Then : " Thank you . Nothing much @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shaking up , but you 're young and strong . Just take things easy for a few days . Mild cathartic . I will send you something from the dispensary . " Joe awaited his mother 's message . He could not imagine her sending this man to him without putting words in his mouth . At her best she was as subtle as a howitzer . The two men stared until the silence grew awkward and Muldoon screwed up courage : " I 'd get out of here , if I were you . You might find yourself badly compromised . Chi-this  --  know what I mean ? " Joe did , but he pretended ignorance . " Eurasians  --  touch o ' the tar-brush  --  strange people  --  dam ' dishonest as a rule  --  no character  --  inherit the vice of black and white , with the virtues of neither . " " What about it ? " " She 's Eurasian . Thought you ought to know it . " Who ? Miss Weems ? " BLACK LIGHT 135 " No . Ca n't accuse Miss Weems @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Dam ' good-looking wench with dark hair , dark eyes  --  and dark intentions , you may take my word for it . Nod as good as a wink to a blind horse  --  be on your guard  --  blackmail  --  very plausible , I do n't doubt  --  conspiracy  --  h-sssh !  --  do n't say a word . " Joe said none  --  waited . There was an awkward pause before Muldoon renewed the assault : " This is confidential , of course . Deep it to yourself . That pretty little Rita person is the daughter of a British Tommy and a half-breed whore in the bazaar , who died of cholera . " " You 've proof of that ? " Joe asked . His voice had changed perceptibly . He was leading his witness , thawingtoward him slightly on the surface , tempting him to deeper indiscretion . " Never can prove a thing when you want to in this dam ' country . She 's a psychic  --  know what that is ? It 's a form of psychosis not uncommon among Chi-chis . Fortune-tellers @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ old as the Delphic Oracle  --  nothing more nor less than an over-developed and vaguely spiritualized sex-instinct overbalancing a character weakened by superstition and a craving to be important . " " Have you examined her ? " ' Ca n't say I have . Do n't care to . Ca n't be bothered . Dam ' stuff 's too familiar . But why are we standing t You should relax yourself at every opportunity for the next few days . That 's better  --  sit slack . Privately , between you and me , it might do you no harm to get a bit drunk to-night , but do n't tell your motber I recommendedit . Come around to my bungalow and we 'll pull a cork together . " " Good of you , I 'm sure . " Another pause . " Why , no , I 've not examined her , but the girl 's notorious . Too bad we have n't an institutionwhere she could be properly looked after , but the government ca n't afford that kind of luxury . The case136 BLACK LIGHTmight yield @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's a religious complex there  --  sings mystical hymns in the jail-yard at midnight . " Joe nodded but looked incredulous . Ile wished to hear the full indictment . His mother he knew could pump a man like Muldoon dry in fifteen minutes , and corrupt him utterly in five . If he could hold his own tongue this fool would betray her . Muldoon mistook silence for proof of his own astuteness , so he blundered on : " You know , Annie Weems is n't socially recognized . There 's nothing regular about her . Luckily for her she keeps out of politics , or we 'd have closed her mission long ago . She has some sort of understanding with the Hindu priests  --  nobody knows exactly what 's the basis of it , but you know the proverb : love of money is the root of all evil . ' Love o ' money  --  superstition  --  blackmail  --  black arts  --  clairvoyance  --  mixed blood  --  you ca n't make head nor tails of that mess or separate one ingredientfrom another . The best thing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ young Englishman who got caught in a mess like that . Clairvoyant humbug . Fooled him . Hypnotized him . Persuaded him to finance a new religion . He took the girl to London . He not only lost social caste but half his fortune with it . Ended by his being blackmailed half out of his senses . And at that , the girl was only a poor half-wit who handed over the cash to a few conspirators behind the scenes ! " " Has Miss Weems ever blackmailed any one ? " " I ca n't say . But nobody knows where she gets the money to run the mission . All we know is she gets it . I 've worked for years on police court cases . It 's one of the commonest occurrences to find criminals , or potential criminals , using a clairvoyant or a trance medium to guide them in a conspiracy . They think they can get information from another world .

That Rita girl is a good-looker , of course . I can easily understand your wanting her . But beware of those Eurasians they 're too promiscuous . That fellow Hawkes , for instance  --  you know what soldiers are . Besides , she 's in some way mixed up with the orgies that go on in a Hindu temple . As a medical man with more than a little experience of this country , I advise you to keep clear of her . Good God  --  I 've seen scores of fine young fellows sent home ruined  --  physically , morally , mentally . Cured ? Yes , after a fashion  --  cured of happiness and manhood for the rest of their natural lives . Would you like me to look at those cuts on your face ? They 're beautifully bandaged  --  seems a shame to disturb such a neat job  --  Annie Weems do it ? She and Hawkes , eh ? Well  --  that fellow Ilawkes is something of a wizard . Let 's let it rest . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Another pause  --  a long one  --  Joe as conscious of his mother as if she were there in the room . ( wick work ! And what luck she always had in discovering creatures like Muldoon to do her bidding at a moment 's notice . Muldoon broke the silence . " My Ford is outside . Let me drive you to the hotel . " " No , thanks . " " Well , young man , I 've warned you . " " Good of you , I 'm sure . Will you send me your bill ? I 've no check-book with me . " " That 's all right . Your mother " All right , send the bill to her . " " I think I 'd better see you in the morning . Those cuts may need attention . " " Just as you like . " Joe had opened the door . There was nothing for Muldoon to do but walk out . To preserve his dignity he blustered , snubbing Annie Weems again , ignoring her as he swaggered to the front @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Joe : " To-morrow then .. Meanwhile I 'll have my assistant138 BLACK LIGHTmix you something  --  send it to the hotel . Good day . " Annie Weems stood in the door of the living-room . Joe faced her . Suddenly Rita 's gay laugh broke the silence . " Can you see his aura , Annie Z " " Hush , child ! Do you still wish to see me alone , Mr. Beddington ? " " Yes , more than ever . " Rita put both her arms around Annie Weems from behind . In that light it looked almost like two heads on one pair of shoulders  --  one gray but eternally young , the other young but humorously wise . There was somethingageless about Rita  --  something , too , that made a fellow 's heart jump when he saw her suddenly . Her eyes seemed to see beyond surfaces . " Me too  --  talk in front of me , " she urged him . " She would tell me afterward  --  and besides , I know what you are going to say . " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He followed them into the living-room , where Rita again sat on the arm of Annie Weems ' chair . " Where 's Hawkes ? " he asked . He did not want Hawkes to listen in . " Ilawkesey is on the roof , mending the valve of the water-tank . " She had the light behind her , through the slats of the window-shade . It streamed in layers on her dark hair , edging it with gold . One stream of it poured on her hand ; she was pressing the tips of her fingers , perhaps excitedly , on the book that lay on the table beside the chair ; Joe noticed that the half-moons of her nails showed no trace of telltale color . Annie Weems folded her hands in her lap . " Well ? " " No , ' . ' said Joe , " let Rita say it . She said sheknows what I 'm going to say . Let 's see if she 's bluffing . " " I know part of it and I can guess part of it , " saidRita @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the answer to what you 're chiefly curious about ; but when youthink about it with your brain you 're not so sure youBLACK LIGHT 139know . And what you 're quite sure that you know is where you 're wholly wrong . " " Say it in plain English , " Joe retorted . " Last first . You think you know a Hindu temple is an awful place , where there are orgies . So there are , in some temples , but only in some of them . You think my mind , and probably my soul has been corrupted . And you wonder about my body . You wonder whether I 'm loose , as you would call it . " " Right , " said Joe . " But you are wrong , " she answered . " If it is your business to know that , you know it without my telling you . If it is not your business , nothing I could tell you would make the slightest difference . You would . form your own opinion , and if it differed from my @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ that would not alter the truth . " " Frankly , I 'm deeply interested . " " In me ? What else do you wish to know ? Do you wish me to tell that , too . Very well . You wonder why Annie let me continue in a Hindu temple instead of sending me to the United States as soon as she discovered who I was . Is there a color-line in the United States ? " " There is , " said Joe . " Do you know now why I pressed my fingers on this book 1 I have no Indian or Eurasian blood , but who can prove it ? " Joe hesitated . All the arguments that occurred to him seemed trite before he turned them on his tongue . " Civilization " he began . " Am I a savage ? " " I should say you have had experiences that you should have been spared from . " " For what are we in the world , except for experiences ? Could I do more good in the United States than I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ something you know that I don't. " 140 BLACK LIGHTAgain Joe hesitated . " Cultural surroundings are important , " he said awkwardly . " There 's an indefinable something that a college education gives " I lack it ? " She did not wait for him to answer . She came over to him , stood beside his chair , speaking in a voice that thrilled him so strangely that he felt as he did when listening to organ-music stealing by a stair of overtones toward infinity . " Joe  --  I do n't want to humiliate you . If we talk to each other like this we 'll both be sorry , because it 's something you do n't understand . It 's something you will have to find out for yourself , since nobody can tell you  --  not even the wisest person  --  although you can have help  --  I can try to help you . " Puzzled more than ever , trying to resent what he felt was a slur on his dignity , Joe looked up at her . But that is not an attitude @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . He found himself smiling . The smell of her body was sweeter than honey and wine in his nostrils . " Funny , " he said . " I came here to help you . " " It was funny , was n't it ? Something like helping a plant by pulling it out by the roots ! " He almost ached to put his hands on her . The artist half of him danced to the sweep of the line of her figure ; she was one of Botticelli 's springtime mistresses , more maddening because nature seemed so in love with her that she was guarded by something impassable  --  something that checked impulse . The part of him that had been trained to make cold appraisal and to view ironically anything that named its price or did not name it , recognized a challenge . The opposing force locked him in a sort of vise in which speech died unspoken . It was Hawkes who broke the silence , entering the room with the deliberate calm of a bearer of exciting news . He walked over to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ changed his mind and broke his news aloud : " I 've fixed the valve , Miss Annie . You can have the tank filled now . Did you know you can see down four streets from the bricks the tank rests on ? There 's a closed carriage and two good horses waiting about a hundred yards away . Two men on the box . Two footmen . Four tough customers on foot , lurking near , one of ' em speaking now and then through the slats to some one in the carriage  --  probably a woman . They 're Poonch-Terai 's men . " " Can you get help ? " Annie Weems asked . " Yes , Miss . I 'll go and attend to it . " IIe walked out as nonchalantly as he probably would have done if they had told him that the empire was in ruins . " Amal must have told them where I am , " said Rita laughing . She appeared afraid of nothing . " Poor Amal  --  she has set her heart on high places for me . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ all the world would lie at my feet to be petted and blessed . " Annie Weems rose from her chair . " That ayah ! " She put on her spectacles  --  stared at Rita , then at Joe . Joe stood up ; she stepped toward him . " I will tell you something . " " No , no , Annie ! " " I am determined . Mr. Beddington , that ayah  --  who saved Rita when she was a baby  --  who has served and watched her ever since  --  who worships her beyond all reason , as it is n't right that any human should worship another  --  Amal , her name is Amal  --  is the principal reason why I have never sent Rita home to the United States . " " The other reason is , that I would not have gone , " said Rita . " You would have gone , child , if I had seen my way to send you without doing you a worse injustice than was done by keeping you in India . Mr. Beddingtonthatayah is the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Rita 's parents were . I say I know , but I have no proof . Amal is a brave , loyal , obstinate , fanatical , devoted woman , with far more intelligence than appears on the surface . Her whole heart and soul is wrapped up in Amrita . She told me the truth , but she has never once told it in the presence of witnesses . She even lied to Rita about there being black blood in her veins , in order to make her dislike the idea of calling herself white . " " But Rita knows she 's not Eurasian , " Joe objected . " Yes , I told her . So did Ram-Chittra Gunga . So did the temple priests , who have their own means of judging . But then Amal spread the tale through the bazaar . She spread it so cunningly that it became what the courts would call common knowledge . After that she threatened to go before a judge and swear Amrita is Eurasian if any one should make any kind of move to take the child away @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a snake-charmer ; and he found others . I do n't know how Amal found enough money to bribe them , but she did , and she bound them later on into a sort of secret religious cult , based on prophecies about Amrita 's future . You would think Amal is stupid , to look at her . She is as cunning as she is determined . " Joe smiled , sympathetic but ironical . " An attorney , Miss Weems , could have solved the problem for you . " " So I thought . I tried one . There are only Indian attorneys here . I chose the best of them , but Amal learned of it . She ran to Maharajah Poonch-Terai . Tell Poonch-Terai about a new young girl and he would cross the Himalayas on foot to take a look at her . Once tempted , he would rather die than let the girl escape him . He saw Rita  --  Amal told him my attorney 's name . Ile interviewed the attorney . The following day the attorney washed his hands of the case @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ . We were alone  --  in this room . I accused him of dishonesty , and of taking pay from Poonch-Terai . He denied it , butBLACK LIGHT 143he laughed nervously and threatened to accuse me of trying to procure false evidence , and of conspiracy . " " Conspiracy to do what ? " " Conspiracy to blackmail the relatives of Rita 's allegedparents , in the United States . He declared he would charge me with it , and would produce witnesses , if I made one move to take her out of India . He meant , out of Poonch-Terai 's reach . In this country , a dishonestperson can buy witnesses for any purpose . " " In other lands , " said Joe , " it 's sometimes easier to buy a juryman  --  or to send a judge 's wife and daughter for a fine vacation on the continent . A mis-trial is more expensive , but it 's safer than perjured evidence . " " None of that really matters , " said Rita . " It is n't the real reason why I @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I was speaking . There was another reason , and a very strong one . Rita has gifts of a kind that could not have developed amid harsh surroundingsor in a critical atmosphere . She is strong now and perfectly balanced ; but it would have been not far short of murder to have sent her to a public institution , where other children would have treated her like chickens picking on a lame one . I do n't mean she could not have survived physically  --  she is as healthy as a young horse  --  always has been . But her spiritual nature would have died , like something exotic shrinking from chill wind . Misunderstood , she would either have rebelled against routine , or perhaps have gone mad from suppression . I was not ill-pleased to keep her here . I have given her the very best there is in me , and I have never left this mission even for a short vacation in all these years , for fear of neglecting her for a single minute or of being absent when she might need my help @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ adopt her ? " Joe asked . " It did . But there were legal difficulties . I have had to protect her as best I could with the aid of those good Hindu priests . But now I ca n't protect her any longer . Poonch-Terai is too powerful  --  too cunning-14 BLACK LIGHThe has too many agents and too much money for me to be able to resist him , even with native Indian cavalrymenand Sergeant Hawkes to help . Rita must go to the United States . " " Why do you confide in me ? " Joe asked her . The side of him that was trained to examine motives and to disbelieve all unproven statements , doubted her . The other side knew she was telling the truth . " Why me ? " " That is something Rita must tell you , " she answered . He faced Rita , curiously pleased . So he had been discussed already  --  passed on  --  in a sense accepted ? It gave him an indescribable feeling of cosmic importance , that had no logical basis whatever , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ vaguely disturbed by Rita 's eyes that seemed to have lost their quiet humor . They were not hard now , but there was fire behind them . It dawned on him for the first time , and suddenly , that she was a person of terrific strength of character . " Do you care to tell me ? " he asked . " No . You , wo n't believe . Annie has told you surfaces . Perhaps she thinks you ca n't see deeper than a surface . Few can . " Rita faced him like a huntress using waves of thought for weapons  --  hunting for something hidden  --  something to be caught , not killed . He felt an impulse to help her find it . " All those reasons Annie gave are surface reasons , " she repeated . " They are fate reasons , provided to protect my destiny . I do n't leave India because my place is here , and I know it is here . Why else was I born here ? Here is my opportunity , and Annie knows that . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ our proper place ? " Joe asked her . " Of course we are . And you know we are . Are the stars not in their proper places ? Are you or I more powerful than the stars that we can pull ourselves out of our orbit ? " BLACK LIGHT 145 " Do you consider it your place to be taken and raped by Poonch-Terail " " How do I know ? I may have to learn that lesson . May there not be  --  within his palace  --  something to be done that I alone can do ? If so , does my convenience matter ? If not , then he gives me an opportunity to learn how to defeat dark forces , such as he thinks are omnipotent . He may possibly learn from defeat . I am not in the world to learn cowardice , but courage . I have faculties and talents ; I will use them where I stand . Joe  --  did you ever conquer by running away ? " " Conquer what ?

I was born in India . And here I stay , until my work is finished . " " You 'll find plenty to do , " he suggested . " To me it looks like a distressful country . " " I said , my work  --  not everybody 's work . When mine is finished I shall find myself picked up and planted elsewhere . Or perhaps I shall die . Are you afraid of death ? " " Not specially .

" Much good that will do you , if you are the man I think you are , and if you have the character I think you have . But try it . " Something that Joe knew was filthy  --  a whiff of the complaisance with which he had too often viewed his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ right , " he said , " I 'll take you at your word . I 'll try it . " Hawkes entered the room , grinning . " All right , ladies . I found a messenger . Some o ' the Indian troopers ' 11 be clown in half a jiffy to lick the stuffing out of Poonch-Terai 's detail . " CHAPTER FOURTEEN " Better watch my step ! " HAWKES went in search of a native gharry but it was a long time before he found one . Meanwhile , Joe went to the roof to look for what Hawkes had called the Maharajah 's " detail . " He saw a shuttered carriage standing by the corner of a side-street , its two fine horses stamping fretfully ; there were two men on the box , two footmen lolling on the platform at the rear , and several men who looked like loafers near at hand . He had not watched long when a Ford car stopped two streets away and disgorged five Indian troopers , one of whom strolled casually to the intersection of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ returned to his friends who hitched themselves a little but appeared to hold no conference , although they stood in an idle-looking group . There might be something wrong with the ramshackle car ; with an air of boredom they watched the native driver peer beneath the hood . Presently a one-horsed , two-wheeled vehicle known as an ekka arrived with four more troopers , who joined the first party , straightening their tunics but not seeming to have anything to say . The driver of the ekka left his sweating horse to peer , too , under the hood of the motor . Presently , one more man came on a motorcycle , the echo of its exhaust spattering off blind housewallslike the noise of gun-fire . He leaned his cycle against the stone pillar to which the ekka horse was hitched and joined the others . Still there was no conference ; they appeared to act now like automatons guided by one impulse . They formed up two and two and marched with jingling spurs toward the side-street where the two-horsed carriage and its attendant loafers waited . The ensuing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ savagely . He departed thence like a field-gun going into action , starting with such a jerk that he left the platform-footmen sprawling in the gutter , where they were pounced on by four of the troopers and kicked until no more consciousness was left than enough to drag them , bruised and bleeding , out of sight . Meanwhile , the loafers sought safety in flight , but fortune appeared not to favor them and strategy was lacking . They all ran in one direction in pursuit of the two-horsed carriage ; but eight more troopers , hitherto invisible to Joe , came marching down that street toward them , so they turned back  --  headlong into the arms of the original ten . It was hardly a fight that followed , and it was not exactly massacre , since nobody was slain . It was premeditatedmayhem and as close to being murder as was safe considering the awkward nature of the evidence of dead men 's bodies . Not one of the troopers used a weapon of any sort except his hands and feet , but those were swift @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of drawing knives , thus loosing lawful indignation . Then IIawkes arrived at the intersection , seated on the back seat of the gharry he had hired . He stopped as if to interfere in some way , but suddenly ordered the driver to whip up his horses and vanished out of Joe 's sight . After about sixty seconds , the Maharajah of Poonch-Terai arrived on horseback with two mounted attendants ; he drew rein and watched , until the beaten and tortured corner loafers recognized him and cried to him for help . He turned his back and cantered out of sight then . The troopers laughed but left off punishing their victims  --  let them limp away  --  even stopped a passing bullock-cart and made its driver carry away the worst injured . Then they straightened their tunics , returned to their own vehicles and departed by the way they first came . The whole proceeding had occupied , perhaps , ten minutes . BLACK LIGHT l49Joe turned toward the wooden stair-head , not wishing to keep Hawkes and the hired gharry waiting . He found himself almost @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from the other side of some bed-linen hung on a clothes-line . He noticed that her dingy black sari was made of excellent material and that , though she used the outward gestures of respect , her stare was defiant . There was nothing timid or obsequious about her . Recalling Annie Weems ' account , he thought her eyes looked more than normally intelligent ; but there was a suggestion in them of the baffled anger of a savage . He decided to speak to her : " Why do you follow me wherever I go ? " No answer . She raised a corner of her sari and hid the lower half of her face with it . " I know you can speak English . I wo n't hurt you . Why do you follow me ? " But she acted as if she could not understand a word of English . " Well , " he said , " I 've heard of your kind being hanged . " He wondered why he had said that . Something in the woman 's expression , or mood , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ her aura , as Rita would call it ? What did that mean ? Vaguely , and yet in a way distinctly , he was conscious of a murky red sensation ; but when he stared again at Amal there was not a trace of red anywhere about her . No use talking to the fool since she refused to answer . He turned away . It was dark in the upper stairway , although not too dark to see the steps ; all the way down to the upper floor he saw that same dull murky red ; but the peculiar part of that was that he also saw the steps and the stairway walls in their proper color . There was no red anywhere ; the woodwork was black with age and the stairs were covered with a strip of dark-blue carpet . He was seeing in some way double one way with his eyes , entirely normally  --  another150 BLACK LIGHTway that seemed entirely independent of his eyes . Perhapshe had hurt his head that morning more than he supposed . But he felt all right ; he @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ At the foot of that flight of stairs he turned and looked back . At the top stood Amal staring down at him , dingy as ever , sharply outlined against the sky behind her , but too far within the stairhead casement to be bathed in sunlight . IIe saw her as she was , but also as he had never seen another human being in his life . She was outlined in that murky red , although the outline was no part of her and he could see her proper outline , too , etched by the sunlight . The dull-red waxed and waned like the light of embers blown on by an intermittent draught . He shut his eyes , to test them , and found that with them closed he could still see dullred , although it began at once to take different shapes , condensing into long lines that were barbed where they pointed toward him . " Better have Muldoon examine my eyes , " he remarked to himself . But the thought of Doctor Muldoon brought to mind his mother , who undoubtedly had suborned @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ laughed . She pointed at him mockingly , then checked herself and turned toward the roof . " Is she seeing things , too ' ? " Joe wondered . He descended to the lower floor , where Hawkes was already waiting . He heard him say to Annie Weems : " That 's probably the end of that , Miss . Next time he 'll try some other strategy . Look out he does n't burn the mission and catch Rita as she pops out one fine after-noon . " Nice state of affairs . Two more or less helpless women up against a nineteen-gun Maharajah . What had Government to say about it ? Joe decided there and then to find out . He would mention it to Cummings . The effete fool might resent it , but he would mention it nevertheless . He looked for Rita , but she had vanished . BLACK LIGHT 151 " She went , " said Annie Weems , " back to the temple two minutes ago . " " She 'd make a slap-up shock-troop brigadier , " said I-Iawkes . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ten minutes back . I saw some of it . I came and told her . Rita popped through the hole in the line like General Byng at Vimy  --  through and gone before the enemy can think up a new idea . " " Alone ? " Joe asked . " She 's safer alone than with a platoon , " said Hawkes . " She would not admit she is alone , " said Annie Weems . Joe objected . " Hawkes , you 'd better follow her . I saw that rough stuff from the roof . I should say she 's as safe as a canary in a cageful of cats . " " I 'd follow her , " said Hawkes , " but she said not to . Sir , it may sound comical to you , but there 's more than two or three of us who obey her absolute . " " All right , " said Joe , " I ' 11 go myself . " He thought that Annie Weems ' eyes smiled a little as he said that , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Possibly she was grateful and not amused at all ; he had begun to doubt his own eyes since he saw the ayah 's aura  --  if it was an aura  --  he was not all sure what an aura is . " You found a gharry ? I suppose the driver ca n't understand a word of English ? Come out and tell him for me where I want to be driven  --  to the temple . Make him understand , if you can , that I want to follow Amrita to the temple . " Hawkes interpreted , although what he said to the gharry driver was beyond Joe 's comprehension . The man had no nose ; he looked like a caricature of death , his whip a scythe , his dismal horses skeltons ; he thrashed them mercilessly and the wheels began to rumble over paving stones that were cut from the debris of ancient splendor . Joe sat back and wondered what possessed him that he should feel so disturbed about a girl who had no logical claim on him whatever. 152 BLACK LIGHT " Am @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I do n't believe it . " Nevertheless , he had begun to believe it . He glanced backward and saw Amal following at the patient dog-trot that would have made her resemble a man  --  almost  --  if it were not for her garments . " Ca n't see her aura now , " he reflected , screwing up his eyes to study her . " Must have been the toss I took this morning  --  may have busted a small bloodvessel . " But his eyes were painless and he noticed he was seeing now as well as ever . " Damn the fool , I 'll have this out with her . " He stopped the carriage  --  waited for the ayahbeckonedto her  --  ordered her to get in and sit on the dickey-seat facing him . She obeyed without any noticeablehesitation . " Cheloh ! " he commanded , and sat back to stare at the woman as the iron-tired wheels resumed their jolting to the clicking obbligato of a loose shoe . IIe could see no aura , but he sensed antagonism . " Dammit , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ ? Money ? " He recalled her strange indifference to money when he had given her some in the Yogi 's presence . " Threats ? " She would know he had no real intention of carrying them out . Anyhow , she looked like the sort who would take a whipping in stoic silence . And besides , he rather liked her  --  admired her deter-mination - " You know which way Rita has gone , " he said at last . " Tell the driver . Tell him to overtake her . " No answer . She did not even trouble herself to grin uncomprehendingly . She met his eyes unflinching . " Where 's the man with the snakes ? " he demanded . Again no answer , and no trace of embarrassment . Ile turned his head to see whether Chandri Lal was following , but there was no sign of him . He turned again swiftly , intuition warning him of danger ; but the ayah had not moved  --  or , at any rate , he did not see her move . He could have @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ made his skin creep . BLACK LIGHT 153 " Do as I tell you , " he said , " or out you get . Tell that gharry-wallah where to find Amrita . " She sat still for a moment , then decided suddenly to understand him  --  faced about , knelt on the seat and spoke to the driver hurriedly in low tones , apparently repeatingsome direction again and again . Joe noticed the shape of what might be a long knife underneath her sari . At last the driver made a gesture with his whip as if he understood , and the ayah resumed her former position , staring at Joe as if he were some kind of curiosity . " What 's the knife for ? " he demanded ; but she seemed not to hear , or at any rate not to understand him . They began to drive through crisscross streets , in which there was scarcely room to pass another vehicle and wheel-hubs scraped the wall on one side while the driver screamed obscenities at calm indifferent owners of bullock-carts , who leisurely twisted the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ course between tented street-booths and piles of smelly merchandise . They crossed an ancient bridge , beneath which was no water but a most amazing smell . Joe , watching the crowds and the narrow side-streets for a glimpse of Rita , presently lost sense of direction ; but when they passed the jail he recognized it , and it seemed to him then that the driver almost exactly reversed his course as they turned again into the city , straight toward the declining sun . Ile glanced at his watch and was surprised to discover how late it was . He noticed presently that their course intersected a street down which they had come three-quarters of an hour ago . He understood then . " I get you , " he said , laughing at himself . " Your turn now to get me . Out with you  --  and walk home , damn you ! " He laughed again ; it was the first time in his life that he had ever taken a woman for a drive and made her walk back . He supposed he should kick154 BLACK @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unresentful  --  amused at his own stupidity and rather admiring the ayah for getting away with the trick . " here , wait a minute  --  tell that gharry-wallah to drive me straight to the hotel . " It was too late to go to the temple if he hoped to be back in time to dress for dinner . Rita must have reached the temple long ago , if that was where she had really gone , and if she had not been kidnaped on the way there . Somehow or other , the thought of Poonch-Terai acquiring Rita for his harem or seraglio , or whatever the scoundrel called his collection of women , made Joe hotter under the skin than even his mother 's tyrannies had ever made him . One thought merged into another . He imagined himselfriding to Rita 's rescue  --  plain Joe Beddington on horseback , making D ' Artagnan look like ten cents . " Guess I 'm younger than I thought ! " He had a sense of humor anyhow ; he could laugh at himself . He could even laugh at @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thought of Rita . " Am I a stage-door Johnny ? What 's come over me ? Would I care to marry her ? " IIe pondered that a long time as the comfortless gharry bounced and rumbled toward the outskirts of the city . He decided he did n't know . It was a serious business to marry a woman . He might make her his mistress . That was what sensible men did=he could think of scores of them . If a woman has n't social position , make her your mistress and consult your lawyer at the same time . Have to look cut for the Mann Act and the immigration laws . A few awkward situations now and then , no doubt , too , but what the hell  --  life 's full of awkward situations . Not so good for credit , either . A lot of snooping hypocrites , with rented pews in church and their souls in their pocketbooks , soon pass the word around if a man with a reputation worth attacking keeps a woman on the quiet . Swine , he 'd @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 155word passed to him dozens of times  --  had seen what happened to the offender 's credit . " If I 'd sense I 'd not see her again . Get out of India . She does n't want to see me ; if she did , she 'd have had word with me again before she left the mission . Interestinggirl , though -- never yet liked any woman half as much . Innocent l I wonder . She spoke without shuddering at the thought of being kidnaped for a harem . Better pull out  --  leave her to Annie Weems and her own devices  --  save her from mother 's teeth and claws by clearing out and taking mother with me . " But he was afraid of his mother . He knew it and laughed at himself . As he neared the hotel he ordered the driver to stop , overpaid him recklessly because he did not know what the proper fare was , and walked , to avoid being seen by his mother . He wanted to get to his room and lie down for a while before dressing for @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a bath and forty winks or so . However , his mother saw him  --  called to him through her window . He would rather interview the devil just then . But there was no avoiding her . " Joe , that doctor says there 's nothing much the matter . Ca n't you take that bandage off ? It looks awful . Wo n't court-plaster do ? " " Who cares what it looks like ? " " That 's not the proper way to speak to your mother . I care . I 've ordered a special dinner in honor of Mr. Cummings ; he will be here at eight o'clock . If you 're so selfish that you ca n't try to make yourself look presentable " Mother , I do n't feel up to facing dinner with Cummings . I ca n't endure the ass ; besides , my head aches . " " You 're a cry-baby , bemoaning a scratched face  --  and with no more sense of obligation to your mother than a dog has . " " You yell loud enough when the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ I 'm a woman . And besides , I put up , without a murmur , with more insolence from you than would drive some mothers into their graves . I wo n't have you running out on me like that . The idea . Maharajah Poonch-Terai is coming too . I need you to help entertainhim . " " Oh , my God . " " If you 'd swear a little less about your God , and think a little more about your mother , you might be a man , Joe . " " Poonch-Terai , eh ? " " Yes , but be careful to call him Maharajah PoonehTerai . His title is older than the King of England 's . He 's " " I 'll be down in time for dinner . " He was not afraid , at any rate , of Poonch-Terai . CHAPTER FIFTEEN " Walls have ears in India . " JoE stared at himself in the pinchbeck bathroom mirror . He was doing his best to shave around the bandages . He was standing naked . Except for a bruise @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , with the glow of health all over his skin , well muscled  --  beautiful might be the right word , although it would have offended him , had he thought of it . He had a thoroughly masculine contempt for the idea of beauty in his own person . Nevertheless , he knew his naked body would have thrilled a sculptor , especially when the muscles rippled under the skin . But his eyes were " No , not ghastly . What the devil is it ? " There was fear in them , he thought , but also something else that underlay the fear . He remembered a bedside at which he had sat watching an acquaintance die  --  not exactly a friend , although he should have been . Damned decent fellow , Edmondson  --  uninsured  --  a wife and kids  --  racked by the pain of his broken bones  --  refused morphia  --  knew he was dying  --  horrified by the thought of poverty awaiting his dependents  --  and yet " Confident  --  that was it , confident . I knew he could see something that I could @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ did then . Exactly like ' em . What does that mean ? " He went on shaving , tubbed himself and dressed in the clothes that the servant had laid on the bed . He felt a ridiculous impulse to stick an automatic pistol in his back pants pocket . " Must be going crazy . " He locked the pistol away in a suitcase , took a last tug at his tie before the bathroom mirror and started157158 BLACK LIGHTdown-stairs . As he left the bedroom he was conscious of a series of extremely clear mental pictures  --  Rita  --  Annie Weems  --  Hawkes  --  the ayah  --  last of all , but equally vivid , the old Yogi down by the temple wall . " What 's that ayah 's game , I wonder . " One second she appeared as if his brain had photographedher perfectly ; the next she was a soot-black specter edged by tiny tongues of dull-red flame , rather resembling one of those dark dugpas painted on Tibetan banners . He wanted to prepare himself to meet PoonchTeraiand be properly nonchalant , but @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ man  --  nor of Cummingseither . " I+atuous ass . I like him like a boil on the back of my neck . Of the two , I 'd choose Poonch-Terai as a boon companion . Poonch-Terai is n't a sheep with false teeth and a hypocrite 's hair on his back . Cummings should be selling socks in a department store . " He wondered why he hated Cummings  --  no earthly reason for it  --  no sense in hating him  --  he was n't worth hating . He decided to be extra-civil  --  to try to draw him out in conversation  --  to look for something admirable in the man . He glanced into the dining-room and saw flowers on the table  --  extravagant cutlery , too ; his mother had evidently dug out the silver-gilt Kashmiri knives and forks that she bought in a store in Srinagar . " If she knew what the pattern on those knives and forks was all about , she 'd maybe hide ' em , " he reflected . He had taken the trouble to ask the antique dealer for an interpretation @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ no sickly-minded moralist , but he was shocked all the same . He rather liked the notion now of shocking Cummings , who could probably read the pattern 's meaning . Pooneh-Terai , of course , would understand it perfectly . The Maharajah 's malignant amusement and Cummings ' hypocritical embarrassment ought to be worth watching . He strolled out on to the verandah , BLACK LIGHT 159where his mother waited in a creaking wicker chair . " Joe , do you feel better ? " " Feel like ten cents . " " Nonsense . Come over here and let me fix your tie for you , it 's coming undone . " He submitted patiently , hating a bow-knot the way she tied it , tight in the middle ; he turned away from her and loosened it surreptitiously as soon as something else attracted her attention . Then the night shut down with Indian suddenness and Cummings came , important in a brand-new rickshaw with nickel-plated lamps and pneumatic tires . The contraptionlooked vaguely familiar ; suddenly Joe rememberedwhere he had seen it on exhibition . IIad his @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ He whistled softly to himself . " Wonderful ! " " said Cummings , advancing up the steps with an air of subdued pomposity . " Upon my soul , dear lady , I never enjoyed such luxury in all my life . A long day in the office , but then this  --  why , thanks to you I 'm young again ! " So-ho ! So she had given him the rickshaw . Why not a perambulator ? Little the fat fool guessed what sort of strings were attached to a gift from Kitty Beddington ! But what could she see in such a specimen worth tying strings to ? " Oh , good evening , Joe . How are you ? Hurt yourself ? Not anything serious , I hope ? " " No , nothing serious . " Joe , if you please ! He wondered what Cummings ' first name was . Probably Percy or Archibald . Or possiblyHarold  --  Joe anticipated an awful kick out of callinghim Harold , a name for which , for no earthly reason , he had a fathomless contempt . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ are they already at the pet-name stage ? " No . It was still dear Mr. Cummings and dear Mrs. Beddington . Just as dangerous for him , but not
