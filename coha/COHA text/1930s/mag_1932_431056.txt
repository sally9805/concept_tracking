 | WITH that mother whom I know so well , the mother of three lively boys , eight , nine , and twelve , I was standing one bright afternoon in late winter beside a casement window of a Charming home in New Jersey . The boys were outside having a snow fight . Sometimes this mother calls the boys her " hobbies . " Sometimes , as on this occasion , when the eldest sent a snowball crashing through the sun-parlor glass , she calls them her artillery corps ! I spoke of the cares and anxieties involved in the rearing of children . " But it 's that way no more , " she protested vigorously . " Or should not be ! All that is changed . The children have been emancipated . And the emancipation of the children means the emancipation of the parents . So many of the responsibilities that we used to think belonged to parents have all gone away . " " Just where have they gone ? " I asked . " Who is looking after them now ? " @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Good ! " I answered , though somewhat dubiously . And presently I voiced my doubts . " Inquire ! " she retorted . " Later on you may think differently . Find out what it is that is mainly responsible for trouble between parents and children now . You will discover that there is something new in the job of fathers and mothers today ! " Thereupon I began an extensive research . I started with those innumerable cases of trouble between parents and children concerning which there are public records . Figures from various sources , including the police departments of all the larger cities of the country , show that annually in the United States more than a hundred thousand boys and girls run away from home for periods ranging from a few days to many months ! And in this connection I made a curious discovery . Comparatively few of these runaways leave home because of hard , cruel , and unusual circumstances . The great majority run away from fond and anxious parents . Rather , I should say , from overfond and over-anxious parents . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ regard as parental interference , strictness of one kind or another . Frequently , to the adult , these restrictions do not seem to be of a eery burdensome nature , and the rebellion appears out of all proportion to the exciting cause . In addition , I consulted innumerable fathers and mothers , professional men , business men , home mothers , career mothers , Boy Scout leaders , social workers , the directors of children 's societies , and psychiatrists . They told me stories of all kinds pof troubles that occur between parents dud their children . Frequently , I discovered , the very same troubles that are found in the homes of runaways exist in the homes of children who do not run away . In the end , I found myself thinking something like this : " In all these cases , the similarities are more pronounced than the differences . All have an element that is much the same . Can it be that there is some one thing that accounts for most of the troubles that come between us and our children today ? @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ this thing . I could only ask myself what it was . I called on a distinguished physician and psychiatrist , Dr. Bruce B. Robinson . A recognized authority on child guidance , he has specialized for years in the adjustment of family problems . During the past ten years he has analyzed parent-child relations in more than five thousand families of New York , Boston , Washington , and Cleveland . Five years ago he was called to Newark , New Jersey , by the Board of Education to organize a Child Guidance Department for the city schools . Today he has under his care more than seventy-five thousand school children . The problems of all the children in the Newark public schools who have trouble either at home or at school , and likewise the problems of their parents are referred to him through the school principals . I found Dr. Robinson in a large , welllighted room of the Department of Education Building where he was surrounded by books and toys and games , and children . I told him what I had done , explaining my problem @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ thing that is primarily wrong , " I said , " I want to be able to name it . That 's important . For , once we know what is wrong , we shall have gone a long way toward making it right . " " Nowadays , " he returned , thoughtfully , " we seem to think that raising children is a more complicated problem than it used to be . Because of the rapid shift of rural families to the cities , because of the movies , the automobile , apartment living , the disappearance of vacant lots and other natural recreational opportunities , what appear to be new problems are arising continually . However , if we go a little deeper ,  | we find that most of the new problems are simply variations of one old problem . " Let me put it another way , " he added . " Today , the experienced psychiatrist can easily name some fifteen hundred causes of trouble between parents and children ? fifteen hundred different items ! In this conversation , you and I might talk about @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , in one form or another , we should be discussing one and the same thing . You were quite correct in what you said a moment ago . There is one fundamental thing that is wrong . " " And what is that fundamental thing ? " I asked . " We are not helping our children grow up . We do not encourage them to mature . We think of them as children , to be guided by directions , long after we should be thinking of them as young adults with problems of their own to meet and solve in their own way . We are making decisions for them that they should make for themselves . We are taking upon ourselves responsibilities that belong to them . We are interfering with their development . " True , the mistakes we make are most commonly the mistakes of over fondness , over-anxiety . The consequences are none We do not encourage our young people to mature . We coddle them , make decisions that they should make for themselves . While our mistakes are most commonly those of @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the less devastating . They are worse as the children grow older . " " Tell me what we do that hinders our children in growing up , " I said . " Once you have made that clear , I shall ask you what we can do to help them mature . " " A few days ago , " he answered , " the principal of one of our high schools referred to this department a boy of fourteen . Shy and moody , he was disagreeable with the other boys and did not participate in their games . He was a bright boy , but the boys who should have been his friends and playmates derisively called him Pudd'n head ' ! " With his mother , this boy came to have a talk with me . When my assistant had introduced the mother , he turned to the boy , and said , " Here we have a young man from high school . ' " Promptly the mother remarked : Why , he is n't a young man at all ! He 's just a child @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ difficulty . I learned that this boy had not been weaned until he was twenty months old . His mother had dressed and undressed ( him until he was ten . She had picked up his . clothes after him , ' and hung up his pajamas . She had not allowed him to play with other children . She was still tying his necktie . She never let him go out after supper . In a word , he has always been ' treated as a baby at home . Consequently , he is a baby at school . " It is this kind of young man , excessively sheltered and over-protected , who is late on the job in after life , who crabs ' if he is called upon to work after closing time , who demands that he shall be the center of attention in his own house after he marries , is jealgtts and ill-tempered , and unreasonable toward his own children . " I explained to this mother how , her method of dealing with the boy was interfering with his education and perhaps handicapping @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , he ' is now called " Mr. " In many other ways he is treated as a young adult . You can not treat boys and girls as young adults in school , @#  | if they are treated as children at home , without producing conflicts and other troubles of a most serious nature . ' " Sometimes a mother says , I can not get my girl to go to the Y.W.C.A. She wo n't go to dances . The other girls and boys do n't like her . At home she is moody , dissatisfied , and unhappy . What is wrong ? ' ' Usually , we find that the mother of a girl of this kind , with intentions all for the best , has most painstakingly shielded her daughter from the contacts and experiences that were most desirable for her at an early age . Perhaps she felt that her daughter was not old enough to begin school at the age when most children go . Instead of starting at five , the child was kept at home with mother until seven . Mother @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ company . Consequently , the girl has had to play much by herself . Such a girl , of course , has never been allowed to be away from home over night , nor been sent to the camps to which , for the sake of the independence and initiative it develops in them , all boys and girls should go from the age of six , if possible . " Modern parenthood ! " he went on . " There is a vast difference between the old and the new way of doing things . A profound change has been taking place . I think it is a lasting one that we shall understand better as time goes on . " The biggest mistake that parents can make today is in not thinking of their job in this new way . The one and only business our children have on hand is to grow up ! As parents , our job is to cooperate , avoiding every kind of harmful or disturbing interference . In that respect , the job of parenthood today is a new kind of job . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ from which we should handle it . " Observers who do not understand the nature of this change ( it is still going on ) are likely to exclaim : The young generation is in the saddle ! They dominate their parents ! Parents can no longer command obedience ! They have lost their authority ! ' " Unquestionably , authority of the kind that characterized the strict disciplinary type of parenthood is passing . We ought to let it go . In American homes today a far nobler thing is taking its place . Confidence Instead of Authority " Modern parents do not want their children to grow up under a strict disciplinary regime that has as its object obedience for the sake of obedience . Rather , they respect their children 's rights and individualities . They talk things over . They treat their children 's views with respect and courtesy . They realize that ' a child brought up under a regime of authority is in many ways handicapped in his preparation for life . He comes to rely upon authority instead of upon his own judgment . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ unprepared for the more complicated situation ? that arise as he grows older . " The vital thing and the better thing that is taking the place of the old-time authority is confidence . We may get the same results as formerly . Our children may do what we would like to have them do . But they do it because of confidence in us as sympathetic friendly adults of mature judgment , not merely because they have been told to . " Nowadays it frequently happens that parents who do not recognize the new regime lose the confidence of their children . Indeed , it might be said that there is a kind of solidarity among our , young people in recognizing how things ought to be . To be sure , they do net analyze it . They would not express it as I have put it here . But , intuitively , owing to a natural craving to mature , to experiment , to get both hands on life , to push out on the ocean behind the prow of their own boat , they grasp the principle @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ beyond their years by the overprotective methods of dictation and minute supervision , they resent it . Trouble comes . " " A case in point , please , " I suggested . " I am not sure that I understand the application of these interesting remarks to real life . " " I have in mind a girl whom I shall call Harriet Van Orsdale . " Nineteen at the time of the incident I am going to describe , she was the daughter of a prominent New York lawyer . Harriet 's upbringing had been supervised in minutest detail . From childhood she had been told what to do , how to wear her hair , who should be her friends . Until she was seventeen , owing to the unrelaxing vigilance of her mother , she had been obliged to have her friends come to her house . She seldom went to theirs . Except when accompanied by her mother she had never been away from home over night in her life . Too Much Supervision " And yet she was a spirited girl . At times she @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ some time past her friends had laughed at her because of the things she could not do . She knew , of course , how the parents of her friends managed in their homes . Still , at home , she seemed entirely acquiescent in a most depressing situation . In the end , it appeared that she was only waiting the opportune moment for a final , definite gesture . " One afternoon she went down town shopping , and did not return . Frantically the Van Orsdales telephoned relatives and friends , and finally sought the aid of the police . " For a time her disappearance was a complete mystery . There was no clue . Her parents were certain that she had not disappeared of her own volition . Ten days elapsed before an aunt , who had long lived with the family , recalled a certain conversation in which Harriet had participated . This had occurred about six months previously . Naturally , the detective in charge of the case was interested . " One morning , at breakfast , the Van Orsdales had been discussing @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ inheritance of thirty thousand dollars which would come to her from her grandmother on her nineteenth 1 birthday ? Her father thought the best thing for her would be an investment in high class bonds , and he mentioned the bonds which he proposed to buy . Harriet 's mother concurred . The aunt , always present in family councils , calculated the interest that the bonds would yield . " I 'm not sure that I want to invest it all , ' said Harriet . I may want to spend some . ' " But not any of your principal ! ' objected the aunt . Just the interest ! ' " I should like to go to Italy , ' said Harriet . " Italy ! An unheard of idea ! Harriet 's mother had never had any desire to go to Italy . She never went anywhere without her sister , the aunt . And the aunt was unable to travel . " Then I suppose I ca n't go , ' said Harriet , and that 's that ! ' " For the moment , that @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ 's desire to travel might deserve serious consideration . No one suggested that it might be possible to arrange the trip for her in company with friends of the family . Of course she could n't go alone ! She was still a child , only eighteen ! Thereupon , Italy dropped out of sight . Harriet said nothing more . During the next six months in the Van Orsdale home her desire to travel was not discussed . " Once in possession of this information , the - detective located the steamship office where a 1 girl answering Harriet 's description had engaged passage for Naples under the name of ' Miss Norton . ' There seemed no doubt as to I the identity of Miss Norton . ' It was later verified . Harriet had already landed in Naples .  | " The Van Orsdales were stunned . What a reproach to their devotion as parents ! It was incomprehensible ! " ' Harriet will fall for one of those foreign counts with shiny manners , no money , and less brains ! ' wept Mrs. Van Orsdale . @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ The tragedy that befell was of an entirely different nature . Harriet has never returned . Very possibly she never will . " I realize that this episode may raise questions that are aside from the point at the moment . What I want to emphasize is that Harriet could not conceivably have done what she did had a relationship of confidence existed between her and her parents . I think it is obvious from what I have already said that she had come to realize that her aspirations and desires , when confided in her father and mother , were not received with understanding and sympathy and encouragement . " And once parents have lost the confidence of their children , for this or any other reason , they can not expect to know what their children are thinking or contemplating . Living together in the same house , they are like two families ? strangers ? wide apart . Under these circumstances , our children may do surprising things , things that puzzle and amaze us . They seem inexplicable , erratic . As parents , we know we @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ For fifteen years only , no more , the subject we are discussing here has been one for scientific investigation and research , As one psychologist puts it , " During these fifteen years more has been done in a scientific way toward discovering what is right and wrong in the relations between parents and children than was done from the beginning of history down to fifteen years ago . " A Code for Parents I inquired further as to what new principles had been established . It is fair to say , I think , that the substance of it all can be summed up in seven principles or rules . They are interesting , stimulating to think about . They are closely related . All are concerned with what parents can do toward helping their children mature . Here they are : Give your child assurance of your affection . Make him feel that he isliked . Avoid coddling . Less demonstrative love and kisses : No petting , spoiling , or babying with too much attention and praise ! Interfere as little as possible in the child 's @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ of directions . Do not answer all your child 's questions as soon as they are asked . Encourage him to find the answers for himself . Talk things ove , r as with a young adult whose individuality you respect . Friendship : Equality ! Mutual respect ! Confidence ! Encourage your children to take responsibility . Stimulate initiative . In matters personal to themselves let them make their own decisions and learn from their own mistakes . It is better that your child should learn by making mistakes than that he should always do the right thing because he has been told to . Do not be distressed or anxious if your child fails in some school subjects . Remember that nowadays book learning is regarded as merely incidental and not the important thing in the real education of boys and girls . The big question to keep before you is this , " Is my child , whether he is five or sixteen , as mature as he should be for hiss years ? " Above all , remember that your biggest responsibility is to encourage and stimulate @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ shall be doing those things that are appropriate to his years . Whet are the things , appropriate for their years , that our children should be doing at various ages ? An important question , this ,  | and one that can not be answered offhand . To begin with , every child should be weaned at nine or ten months . This is important not so much because of the weaning itself , but because , if the weaning is deferred much beyond that age , it indicates that something is wrong in the mother 's attitude . It would seem to mean that the mother has more need of the child than the child of her . Deferring the weaning may influence the mother in indulging an over-protective attitude which should not be allowed to develop . At three the child should be required to put his toys away after he has finished playing . It is training in thoroughness , orderliness . Failure to establish the habit at the right time may mean much trouble later on . At three , also , the child should start @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he is four , and at the latest by five , he should be doing it alone . From the beginning , ( unless traffic conditions prohibit ) , the child should go to kindergarten alone , unescorted by mother or nurse . And he should enter grade school on time . The child that is kept from entering school till he is six or seven almost invariably becomes a problem . Late in beginning associations outside the home , he is thrown with children younger than himself when he does start . At What Ages ? Maturity ? Six is none too soon to begin treating the child as a young adult , discussing with him his likes and preferences and explaining the reason why certain things are asked of him . By the time he is eight , this custom should be fully established . When eight or ten , he should be able to use the bus or the street car , and to go alone to the museum or the library . " It is important that children should get the habit of keeping track of money @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ giving an allowance may well begin when the child is six or seven . It is safe to say that it should never be delayed beyond the age of ten or twelve . " - " By what should one be guided as to the amount of the allowance ? " I asked . " We figure that , from the age of six or seven , the weekly allowance should be one cent for each year of the child 's age . In some cases , when there are many children in the family , this amount may be a burden on the father . It can be less . By the time the child is ten , the allowance should include the carfare he has to use , money for school supplies , moving pictures , lunches , and some money for his clothes . " To assist in handling their allowances , we should have our children purchase a small account book and teach them how to use it . From then on , they should receive a minimum of suggestions as to how the money is spent @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ they make mistakes , that they can come to their parents for help . All supervision over the allowance should be good-natured and ' helpful , never critical. , If possible , the allowance should include one-third for saving . " Today all psychiatrists who look upon child rearing as mainly a venture requiring parents to help their children mature are firmly convinced that one of the responsibilities children should have from an early age is buying their own clothes , commencing as early as the age of twelve or fourteen . " This is an important beginning step for larger responsibilities that are coming later . It is important because boys and girls take it as evidence that we recognize that they are growing up . They respond most capably to the responsibility . " Some . parents fear that in buying their clothes , young people will be wasteful and use bad judgment . In the beginning , for a year or two after responsibility of this kind has been established , parents should , of course , discuss with their children any important purchases they make . But @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ Frequently , because we fail to understand this trait that is so deeply imbedded in the adolescent , we put upon our children a handicap or burden of a peculiar nature that is unnecessary and not well advised . For it is a special hardship for the adolescent when parental requirements distinguish him in some marked way , setting him apart from his own group . And this is true whether the matter at issue involves wearing clothes of conventional cut when the other youths are wearing radical clothes with wide breeches and broad lapels , or the use of the family car , or coming in at a certain hour of night . Sometimes , as circumstances warrant , in view of the trait just mentioned , it is unquestionably advisable to modify suggestions or requirements that parental interest might otherwise dictate . And now I am thinking of Robert , a high school boy of sixteen , the son of an insurance man . At one time , Robert thought he would be a doctor . Later he thought he would be a lawyer . For a while , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ he would go in for that subject . Today he is n't sure what he wants to do , but is inclined to think he will study electrical engineering . What About Careers ? There was a time when Robert 's father refused to let him have an electrical laboratory in the cellar of their home . Distressed by his son 's lack of decisiveness , he decided once and for all , as he thought , that Robert should study law . For eighteen months he held out against Robert 's yearning for things electrical . A change of a profound nature came over the boy . Dissatisfied , unhappy , he became aggressive , defiant , and quarrelsome . A truant from school , he was caught , with a gang of noisy boys , in an escapade that brought him before a magistrate . Social workers and the principal of Robert 's school intervened . They discovered what they believed to be the trouble , conditions at home . They talked with the father . Finally they were able to say to Robert : " Now you can @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ willing that you should have a laboratory at home . " Today Robert is no more a truant . His marks are good . In his spare time , in his cellar laboratory , he is winding armatures and making radio sets . But his father is not satisfied . He criticizes . He still thinks that Robert should prepare for the law , and he is unsympathetic toward the activities going on in the cellar . Whether , in the end , without the sympathy , understanding , and encouragement that he needs Robert . will discover what his true bent is and find his niche , I do not know . Time alone will tell . It reminds me that there is one thing more we can do to help in the growing up process as the time approaches for our children to decide what they want to do , or where they should go to college . We can remember that adolescence is a period of confusion and of great shifting of goals . Because , one day , our young people think they know what they want @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ we must not let ourselves be tempted , from impatience or for any other reason , to make up their minds for them . Unquestionably that father is making a mistake who says , " I 've decided to send John to Princeton ? or Yale ? or Dartmouth . I think I 'll make him a doctor ? a lawyer ? an engineer . " The most we may do is to discuss with John the reasons that should help him decide where to go and what to study . We should help him realize that his interest in mechanical things is not in itself proof that he was cut out for an engineer . In fact , it is now pretty well established that there is a definite correlation  | between mechanical ability and business ability . His mechanical ability may suggest a business career . It is excellence in higher mathematics that foreshadows engineering . Again , merely because John is good in , and likes debating , he is not warranted in a belief that he would find the law congenial . Ability to stand up under @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ essential in law . Here I have indicated the manner in which we should help John approach the all-important decision . It is a complicated matter . We may find that we can help most by putting him in touch with those educational institutions which , nowadays , are prepared to help boys discover their aptitudes and what careers they are suited for . Above all , we must remember that the decision is for him alone to make . It is one of his growing-up responsibilities . If we make it for him , and something goes wrong , we may very properly be blamed . If he makes it , he is much more apt to have the right attitude toward his work in college , and , in the end , toward his career . . . Again , and only yesterday , I was talking with that mother whom I know so well . She was interested in the result of my prolonged experience with other people 's children , and in what I had discovered due to the incentive of her remarks . " And this @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ , " means as much to us , the parents , as to them , the children ! When you plant a tree , you water and tend it , and do what you can to prevent harm from reaching it . But you do not concern yourself with the bending and shaping of each branch and twig . You do only the things you should , and wait , and watch ! You do not worry . You are not anxious . You do not interfere . It 's so true ! Just letting them grow , helping them grow , is the solution of most of our troubles . " And that , I have come to believe , is the secret of most happiness in most homes where things are right between us and our children .
