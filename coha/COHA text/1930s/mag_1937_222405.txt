ARMY &; NAVY <P> Many a U. S. Army and Navy brasshat has publicly echoed the fervid words of his present Commander-in-Chief , " I hate war . " Few would deny that they love to play at war , particularly when they may pick their own playgrounds and seasons . Last week two of 1937 's three major U. S. war games were in full roar . <P> At sea , the mightiest force of naval vessels ever engaged in maneuvers under the U. S. flag fought for the capture of Hawaii and control of the Pacific . <P> In the air , the General Headquarters Air Force-430 officers , 2,500 men , 244 planes , divided into attacking and defending armadas , had begun to bomb the horned toads and rattlesnakes off the desert bed of Muroc Dry Salt Lake in inland California . <P> On land , come August , the 4th Army , consisting of the troops in the 7th and 9th Corps Areas ( 7th-Minnesota , the Dakotas , Iowa , Nebraska , Arkansas , Kansas and most of Missouri ; 9th-Washington , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ California , the Territory of Alaska , most of Wyoming and part of Arizona ) will attack , counterattack , fire off blanks and gas shells into each other 's faces and test a theory that a division should consist of 13,000 men instead of 22,000 now that the U. S. army is becoming mechanized &; motorized . <P> Last major Pacific sea games saw the capture of Hawaii in February 1932 . Marines and infantry landed on Oahu . Unofficially , because referee findings must clear through the Navy Department , this year 's defending Black fleet seemed to have won due to its air superiority over attacking Whites . Fortunately for Admiral Arthur Japy Hepburn , Commander-in-Chief of the U. S. fleet and chief umpire in the Hawaiian games , the sinking of his flagship the Pennsylvania by a submarine was only simulated . Unfortunately for Lieut . Commander John F. Gillon and his mechanic , Glen Beal , the fatal plunge of their plane into the sea was not simulated . Two other planes cracked up off Maui early in May , two landplanes flopped into the shallows @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ none fatal . <P> Reassembled this week in the harbor of Honolulu and at Pearl Harbor , the U. S. fleet currently sails for California . To their bases at San Diego and Long Beach are ordered 42 destroyers , 20 submarines , 12 minesweepers , three destroyer tenders , three submarine tenders , one rescue vessel , one repair ship , four oil-carriers , two storeships , the hospital ship , and three auxiliaries . To San Francisco for the May 28 dedication of the Golden Gate Bridge go the fleet 's ten battleships , four aircraft carriers , 14 heavy cruisers , seven light cruisers , and four plane guard destroyers . <P> Refining the devastating White Spanish technique at the blasting of the Basque " Holy City " of Guernica ( TIME , May 10 ) , Major General Frank Maxwell Andrews commanding the Muroc air war , had spotted an outline of Greater Los Angeles on the desert with circles and triangles representing such legitimate combatant bomb targets as munitions plants , railheads , bridges . First blood last week went to Brigadier General Gerald C. Brant @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ at Culver City to bits .
