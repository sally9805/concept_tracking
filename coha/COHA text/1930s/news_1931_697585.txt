txt The country may soon have from Mr. Hoover one of the most politically courageous actions ever taken by a President of the United States . Support or rejection of the presidential position will be put up to the country . Congress very probably will send to_the ' the President a proposal to provide relief funds for drought sufferers , ' and perhaps for the unemployed , from the federal Treasury . The President holds the proposal is wholly bad in principle and precedent . If he vetoes , it will be with full knowledge that his enemies will leap upon him/with the charge that he is a man who lets abstractions stand in the way of relief of human suffering . Nevertheless th ' strong impression here is that Mr. Hoover will veto . However , the President will hardly rest on a veto alone . He will have the opportunity to explain his stand , to make plain what he believes to be the duty of the private citizen under present conditions and express confidence that the United States does not want a dole even in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ choice between a Treasury appropriation or of going directly into its pocket for disaster relief . Support ' Will Call for Contributions Briefly there appears to be shaping up a situation where support of the President will call for something more than private and editorial expressions of contempt for his opponents . Approval of the Hoover position will be measured in dollars rather than in words , in contributions rather than in resolutions . Citizens of large , medium and small means will be asked to help . However , it is felt here that quick and substantial gifts by people of wealth will most impress the Congress that the President 's position is supported . It is not the appropriation of ** the sum now proposed , which is bothering the administration . Even a larger sum would not affect government finances very ranch . It is the precedent involved that is giving concern . If ** is appropriated now ; what next ? This is a clear case where numerous citizens need help . Will the next demand from some group able to exert political pressure on Congress be @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ established now may be a determining factor . Those who take the administration point of view plainly see the beginnings of the dole . The President is represented as being ready to stop such a movment in its beginning at the risk of his own political future . ? President Cuts Wisdom Tooth There is a very plausible theory that President Hoover was so often advised of his lack of political knowledge , that he began to have doubts about himself on that score . When he was faced with action having a political tinge , as most presidential actions do have , there often seemed to be some uncertainty about his decisions ; that he was doing one thing when he might liked to have done another . Very creditable gossip about Washington is that the President is growing out of that stage . He is said to be coming to an appreciation that there is nothing complex or mysterious about this political business ; that action of the most simple and direct kind always is politically expedient so long as the action is dictated by sin- , cerity and @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ stirred to the pitch where be is ready to proceed in a Lwo-fisted way regardless of any consequence to himself or party . If these stories are well founded , and there is evidence that they are . Mr. Hoover will be found acting more like himself and less like the man whose course often has puzzled those who thought they knew something- about him . ' Nye Probe Strikes Fire Senate Democrats are not nearly so enthusiastic about the Nye committee 's investigation of primary expenditures as they once were . The reason is that the committee has been going into elections in the South , particularly in Alabama , where Senator Heflin says they counted him out . There was reluctance about giving the committee another $50,000 for expenses , but nobody thought of any good way of keeping it away from them . There is a possible rift in the Democraticinsurgent coalition in this matter . The question of Republican regularity raised by the Nye committee in uncovering the NorrisLucas row just will not down .

The possibility of a. major flare-up still exists , , Avoid Recognition of Russia Question is raised whether sending government agent to Russia to determine the actual conditions of convict and forced labor would not constitute tacit recognition of Russia . Many think it would . To get permission for the agents ' presence , this government would have to communicate with the Soviet government and the Soviets would parade that as recognition in any event For this reason , as well as many others , this particular recommendation of the Fish communist investigating committee will not get far . House Reapportionment Notwithstanding continued agitation and introduction of new bills , it seems practically certain that the Congressional reapportionment plan approved last Spring will become effective . Under this plan , the size of the House is unchanged at 435. but several states lose representatives while others gain . In the next few months legislatures in many states will be rearranging the Congressional districts to suit the new  --  @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ what sort of Congresses we have for the next 10 years . Most legislatures are dominated by rural members and their tendency will be to overcome so far as possible the reflection of the city growth at expense of the country districts . They can not wholly overcome that effect , however .
