The white man 's great lines of migration across the continent to the western ocean were three : 1 ) the Oregon trail to the Northwest ; 2 ) the pioneer route west to the Missouri River and over the Rockies to Great Salt Lake ; 3 ) from Leavenworth southwest by the Santa Fe trail to the southern Sierra . Where the oxcart went , Postmaster General Walter Folger Brown has decreed , there shall the commercial airplane first go-until men learn to travel through the air as safely and economically as they can move on earth . Result : migratory lines Nos. 2 &; 3 , plus a third " natural channel " across the flat south and lower southwest , have formed the bases for charted airways . <P> Not yet is through passenger travel by air completely established over all three , but last week the middle ( Santa Fe ) line was opened .

The plane passes near National Cash Register 's factory at Dayton , on to Indianapolis ' new municipal airport for another ten-minute stop .
