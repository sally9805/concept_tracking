Last week the following newsworthy corporations made the following news : Yankee Brass . The banking house of Kidder , Peabody &; Co. tried to break the capital market logjam with an offering of $8,000,000 of industrial bonds-biggest since 1931 . <P> The market was ripe for bond flotations but the success of the Kidder , Peabody issue was due in large measure to the name the bonds bore : Scovill Manufacturing Co. of Waterbury , Conn. , oldest and one of the largest brass companies in the U. S. It was not new financing ; the last thing that rock-sound old Connecticut company needs is money . <P> Scovill issued the bonds in 1930 to buy A. Schrader 's Son . Inc. of Brooklyn ( tire valves ) , and Kidder , Peabody bought them from onetime Schrader stockholders . Since the bonds were outstanding when the Securities Act was passed , they did not have to be registered . Founded in the second year of President Jefferson 's first term ( 1801-05 ) , Scovill is the epitome of all good things Yankee . It was @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ notions were the best stock-in-trade of every 19th Century peddler from Bangor to the Yazoo Delta . Scovill made plates for daguerreotypes . Scovill made the Queen Anne burners for the lamps Rockefeller filled with kerosene . Scovill made time fuses , bullet jackets , shell cases in the War . And today the average U. S. citizen seldom goes from dawn to dusk without using a half-dozen Scovill products . <P> No household word is Scovill because the company deals largely with other manufacturers . It makes parts for radios , watches , clocks , electric fixtures , razors , surgical instruments , automobiles , oil burners , typewriters , umbrellas , overalls , suspenders , locomotives , bicycles . Its own line , beside buttons , includes pipes , rods , sheets , plumbing fixtures , electric motors , blow torches , bolts , screws , nuts , food-mixers , condenser tubes , soda fountain equipment , vacuum cleaners , divers ' helmets , 80% of the world 's tire valves , 55% of all U. S. pins . <P> Shrewd Yankee management has kept Scovill , with 300,000 @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ any year since 1855 . It never duplicated its Wartime peak of $13,000,000 in profits when its enormous Waterbury plant was completely converted to munitions making but with ultra-conservative accounting it made $4,000,000 in 1929 , about $1,000,000 last year . <P> Only Scovill left in Scovill is H. Lamson Scovill , a director . The $40,000,000 company is completely dominated by the sons and grandsons of the late Chauncey Porter Goss , who went into Scovill as an errand boy during the Civil War , was president from the turn of the Century to the end of the War . Present head of Scovill is Edward Otis Goss , an affable hard-headed Yankee of 69 who is Waterbury 's first citizen and a peer in the Connecticut industrial realm . Below him are four Goss vice presidents , most important of whom is his brother John , Scovill 's general manager . And below the official Gosses are countless lesser Gosses learning the business . <P> The Gosses are a clannish family living modestly and quietly in various parts of Connecticut but there is not a trace of nepotism in @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ salaries are low and the everlasting watchword is tight-fisted efficiency .
