txt Sufficient additional revenue will come to leading cigarette manufacturers this year from the advance in cigarette prices announced Tuesday to offset the higher costs of leaf tobacco for this year . and possibly to leave some net gain for the companies . R. J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. , which is now selling by far the greatest number of cigarettes annually , took the lead in raising prices , lifting its quotaton on Camel cigarettes 15 cents a thousand to $6.25 per thousand . Liggett &; Myers Tobacco Co. followed with advances of similar amounts on its Chesterfield and Piedmont cigarettes , and Old Gold cigarettes of P. Lorillard Co. were raised by the same figure . After the usual trade discounts of 10% and 2% , the net advance in price will be slightly more than 13 cents , the new wholesale price being about $5.51 a thousand against about $5.38 previously . On this basis the advance is only about 2.4% . This price includes the $3 per thousand government stamp tax , so that the net price to the manufacturer is raised 13 cents per @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ a rise of nearly 5.5% . Cost Up About 10 Cents So many variables enter into any computation of the cost of leaf tobacco in manufacturing cigarettes that no figure can be obtained which represents the actual increase for any manufacture , but it can be computed that the cost of leaf tobacco used in a thousand cigarettes manufactured in 1937 may r.se as much as 10 cents or even more , depending upon the proportion of burley tobacco , the prices paid for that leaf and also of domestic tobacco used in the cigarettes . Should this figure of 10 cents per thousand increased cost be representative of the industry , it would offset all but 3 cents of the increased price on the cigarettes . Estimates of the actual increase in cost for cigiette tobacco this year must wait upon the closing of the burley tobacco markets . The price of this type of tobacco has fluctuated widely this year . Early sales in December last year were around 25 cents a pound average , but the price quickly soared to an average of 40 cents a pound or @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ level . Within the past week prices dropped sharply , ranging from 20 to 27 cents a pound in principal markets . The amount of burley tobacco in the major cigarette brands varies with each brand , so that each company is affected differently by the price for that tobacco . Furthermore , the prices on cigarette type leaf tobacco this year are understood to have shown even greater increases than the average for the whole crop . First Change Since 1934 The advance by the major companies ? American Tobacco Co. officials will probably meet today to consider the matter ? is the first change since January 9 , 1934 , when the price was advanced 60 cents a thousand . The previous price of $5.50 a thousand had been ' in effect since February 13 , 1933 . On January 3 , 1933 , the price was dropped to $6 a thousand from the $6.85 price in effect from June 24 , 1931 . Prior to that date , the price had been $6.40 since 1925 , with the exception of the period from April 22 , 1928. to @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ and Reynolds sold their principal cigarettes at $6 a thousand , and Lorillard sold its Old Gold at $6.10 a thousand . To whatever additional income to be obtained by these companies from the price advance must be added the prospects for further increases in cigarette consumption this year . The trend of output was sharply upward in 1936 , the year 's total output being in the neighborhood of 150 billion cigarettes , a rise of nearly 12% in the year . Reynolds , with production last year of probably 45 billion cigarettes , will benefit most from the price rise , and even this early in the year it is probably safe to forecast that it will more than make up for this company the 8 cents by which it failed to earn its $3 annual dividend in 1936 . American and Liggett &; Myers American Tobacco Co. and Liggett &; Myers in 1936 probably sold around 36 billion cigarettes each , and Lorillard 's sales , it is believed , were in the neighborhood of seven billion . Tobacco costs for cigarettes reached their low point of the @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ the earlier year consumption of 10-cent cigarettes reached its peak at nearly 25% of the total cigarette output . It was in response to this situation that the major companies reduced prices twice early in 1933 to regain this part of the total business . This move was partially successful , although the 10-cent cigarettes have continued to sell in fairly good volume . This year 's tobacco costs , even on an averaged basis as followed by the major companies with - large inventories , will be nearly 50% greater than in 1933 . Only a thin margin of profit was afforded the 10-cent cigarette manufacturer when leaf prices were considerably lower than they arc today . Should these cigarettes be forced up to higher prices , they would lose considerable of the present price appeal .
