At 9 o'clock one evening this week the Duchess of Kent , chatting merrily with Lord and Lady Portarlington , got in her car outside her house in London 's Belgrave Square and drove off with her guests to the cinema to see Wuthering Heights . Not until she returned hours later did the Duchess learn that she had narrowly missed being shot by an assassin . <P> As the Duchess ' car left the gates , a man standing on the sidewalk raised a sawed-off shotgun , fired wildly . Thinking the noise to be a motor backfiring , the Duchess drove on . Policemen , summoned by a motorist , found the man sitting on the pavement beside his shotgun and a racing bicycle on which he had arrived . As all London buzzed with the attack on the popular , pretty Duchess , wife of the youngest brother of Britain 's King George VI , Scotland Yard announced that its prisoner had just arrived in London from Australia , where the Duke of Kent is to go next fall as Governor General .   @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @
