Out the ornate gates of the Villa Vittoriale on the western slopes of Lake Garda one day last week rumbled a gun carriage bearing the body of Italy 's poet , prince , lover , soldier and No. 1 eccentric , 74-year-old Gabriele D'Annunzio , Prince of Monte Nevoso , who had died two days before . Beside the carriage walked Premier Mussolini and the poet 's estranged wife , the Duchesse of Gallese . Up the tortuous , winding road to Gardone di Sopra wound the procession , through lanes of mourners standing with upraised arms . In the little Church of San Nicolao the village priest imparted conditional absolution , although virtually all the poet 's 80 volumes are on the Catholic Index as " obscene and blasphemous . " All day the body lay on the prow of the battle cruiser Pulgia , which D'Annunzio had dismantled , then reconstructed in a cement bed on the villa lawn , while thousands of visitors trooped silently past . <P> D'Annunzio was born in Pescara in 1863 , a son of well-to-do landowning parents . He went @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ azure-eyed young man and immediately captivated the smart set with his poetry , but it was not until he turned to novels and the drama that his influence was felt outside Italy . His Italian was written in a flamboyant , often baroque , style , lush with passionate simile . He was in fact a Casanova , yearned to be a Napoleon . He carried on world famed affairs with Actresses Eleonora Duse and Sarah Bernhardt , Dancers Ida Rubinstein and Isadora Duncan , other Edwardian beauties . In 1909 his brutally frank description of his intimacies with Duse sent her into a twelve-year retirement . During this period he had also married an Italian , Donna Maria Hardouin , who soon after left him for Paris . <P> Politics . D'Annunzio had been elected Deputy from Ortona de Mare in 1897 . Fellow legislators dubbed him " The Deputy of Beauty . " He took his seat on the Right but one day the tumult and shouting from the Socialist benches impressed him . He stilled the Chamber . " I walk toward life , " he announced , @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ @ But he did not stay long , quit Socialism and politics in 1910 . <P> War . During the war D'Annunzio 's famed exploits were those of a 17th-Century Great Lover who was also a 20th-century ace , adept at machine-gunning troops from his plane in daring swoops and dives directly over the trenches . Romantic Venice was only a few minutes flight from the front , and Italian beauties got the greatest thrills of their lives , bedding in palaces beside the Grand Canal with a national hero who in fact flew off at dawn to fight the Austrians , returned for lunch or dinner at the latest-and so to bed .
